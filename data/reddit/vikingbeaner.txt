The best time to buy is when everybody is desperate to sell. That's how the real money is made

I meant yeah, coinbase is totally free. If you're gonna have more than a couple of hundred dollars i recommend you get a cold storage device such as trezor or ledger. Keeping money in a broker such as coinbase is not the best practice.

The whole ETF thing is the twin brothers trying to make up for that lost fb money. I personally think it's overall better for btc not having an etf

With Gemini you can buy bitcoin before your funds have cleared. You can't take them out of your account before your transfer clears tho

Markets go up and down, that's what they do. They've been doing it since their inception. Bitcoin's fundamentals are solid. But the true power of bitcoin is the independent and decentralized ownership of your assets.

Funny that Colombia had its biggest trading bitcoin volume this month. The month it was made illegal. Lol

Stop self aggrandizing. Even a monkey can operate a trezor. Knowledge of netsec? Child please.

This is a third impulse wave. And although 1200 still meet resistance for sure, it should be short lived and once 2013s high is cleared price velocity should pick up even more. That's what i think.

I reckon most people here have little to no experience in financial speculation. I for one do not look at bitcoin as a speculative asset. The forex market provides better opportunities for making bigger and faster gains, provided you know what you're doing. Bitcoin for me is about security and true ownership of my savings/assets. most people don't realize that the money you have in your bank, or your broker, does not really belong to you. If we go to 2000 awesome, if we go to 200, even better; So i can buy some more. When the bail-ins come, the bank will be the last place you'll want your money to be in,,. And they'll come.

Keep your trezor in a faraday box and you'll be fine
@_date: 2017-01-21 03:45:54
Now get a cold storage device(trezor etc) because if you keep your coins at coinbase they're not really yours.

If price fails to break soon wet may drop below the latest low, possibly not for long, but new buyers may need a lower low to commit to go in.

This is a pretty standard Elliott wave read. I structurally think it's accurate, not sure about the price targets, but his guess is as good as any. I don't like the way they use the term bubble, because it implies irrational behaviour and price action driven by hype instead of value ( tulip style ). 
@_date: 2017-01-02 23:56:54
Poloniex, Gemini.

I use Gemini. Never had a problem

If you can update your phone you can set up a trezor

 Watch the documentary banking on bitcoin, and take your talking points from it. They lay it out in a very simple way, imo.

Isn't that purpose of an ETF having the ability to access a basket of assets? What sense does it make to have an ETF of a single asset, or owing that ETF over the underlying asset? What am I missing here?

Get a trezor and store it there 
@_date: 2016-12-29 19:15:49
Coinbase or Gemini for purchasing, Trezor or Ledger for storing.

Under the current application of fractional reserve system, not even the government creates money. It could via the treasury, but that has not been done since the 60s. Under the current system the government issues bonds which are purchased by the central bank( exchanged for federal reserve notes a.k.a. Dollars) the government then deposits those dollars in the a comercial bank , the bank then lends 90% of those dollars, and in theory the bank should deposit the other 10% in the Fed (that's what's called the reserve limit--which i think there are none under the current system, but i may be wrong on that). Anyway; That 90% in turn gets lent , then deposited, 10% of that goes to the Fed, and so on and on and on. It's called the multiplier effect, and it's literary how money is created. So yes, commercial banks do create most of the money in the system. You can read all about it in a Fed's paper called modern money dynamics

I use bitcoin to store my savings. Basically my trezor is my bank.  But I believe we're at the beginning of a massive impulse 3rd wave (for those familiar with Eliot wave theory ) where price moves fast and far. But price stability and independence is what i care the most. any gains are welcomed of course, and i believe they'll come, but it's really not what mainly attracts me to btc.
@_date: 2017-04-18 07:31:01
Deposit on Gemini, buy bitcoin there then send it to poloniex and trade for whatever. That's how i do it when i  wanna speculate with weird tokens. I never leave my tokens there tho, and i would not recommend anybody do it. I wouldn't recommend leaving them at any exchange, actually.
@_date: 2017-04-01 21:08:16
Obviously you do, because here you keep entertaining me with your stupidly and your engagement. So if anything, it seems that you care quite a bit about what i think. Even giving me links and all l. I mean, if you went to the trouble of finding links and all. I'm even a little flattered. I don't swing your way tho guy. I know you illuminati types like to engage I weird stuff, butt leave that for when you're playing with your other friends. Lol
PS. Bitcoin and blockchain technology are similar but are really not the same thing. But I'm sure a big brain like you already knew that. 
Or are you like those kids in the ads? You're very smart, your mommy says, you just have trouble sounding up words. Lol
