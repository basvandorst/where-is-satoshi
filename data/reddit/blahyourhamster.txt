Bitcoin is scarce, Ethereum is useful and Monero is anonymous.
If I were a betting man I'd say those three currencies are the most likely to make your "possibly as few as three" list.
That being said it's impossible to know how things are going to turn out, it's all just speculation.

Let's use an example.
Imagine if Bitcoin took over the world and is now the default currency for everyone. As Bitcoin has a public ledger, anyone can view any transaction that has ever happened.
A big corporation like Apple probably doesn't want you, the public to know how much they are spending buying goods and services from their suppliers, they'd like to keep that top secret so naturally they would want to use a currency that is private, secure and untraceable. That's where Monero can help.
That's just one theoretical scenario that could happen but yeah, it'll more than likely be used by crooks and hackers who don't want to get caught.

If you are right I will eat my left b-wait a minute.

Bitcoin currently has 175,000 unconfirmed transactions. Is that scalable?

All I see is *******?

He's asking whether attempts at solving the problem are *shared* between computers on the network. For example if computer A tries a hash and fails, it'll tell everyone else not to bother trying that hash.
I have **very little knowledge** of how this all works but I can speculate that this isn't the case. In reality it's more likely to be a **race** between all computers on the network to try to find the solution first, after all, the winner receives Bitcoins.

It wouldn't be on purpose, if nobody can buy or sell on Coinbase then they won't get any money from transaction fees.
I expect Coinbase HQ is on fire right now because they are losing out on so much money.

Welcome to Where everyone will bitch about Coinbase but will fail to offer any alternatives.
@_date: 2017-01-02 14:03:28
Can anyone ELI5 what's causing the value to increase so fast? It's gone up by like $50 today already.
@_date: 2017-01-04 20:57:43
I hope Coinbase would have improved their servers by then.

I'M CALM

I will be doing this as soon as they come back online. Not because I dislike Coinbase, but because I'd rather be in possession of my BTC.
You would have thought with all those transaction fees they could afford to prepare for scenarios such as this. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Alright guys, let's downvote this one into the ground.

I'm just waiting for the right time to buy. Any minute now.
