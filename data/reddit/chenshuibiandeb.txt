once the 21 million cap is hit, the situation changes.  people who make money from mining may not be making as much any more.  now, they would want to raise the cap.  if enough people r in this camp, they can change the cap.  miners are not just worried about their current holdings, they also have to keep making more bitcoin to continue operating.

u just said there is no 21 written anywhere in the code but the 21 million is the result of the formula.  that means the 21 is hidden according to ur own words

a main reason why people think this topic i raised is ridiculous is because the 21 million cap has not been hit yet.  when the cap is hit, the situation changes.   the popular sentiment may change when the 21 million is hit and no more bitcoin can be created.

the situation will begin to change as the cap is approached.  miners may start to notice they r not making as much money to offset their expenses.   there has already been examples of what happens when miners want to make mining more profitable or at least prevent the profits from dropping.  this will be an issue of contention.  it is unlikely that miners will just let it be.

This thread shows one of the fundamental flaws of bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.   The 21 million cap is the most crucial property of bitcoin.  It makes bitcoin what it claims to be.  This is like the molecular formula of gold or the name of Jesus Christ in the bible.   If the molecular formula of what u have is not of gold, u only have fools gold.  If Jesus Christ is not what the bible claims he is, u have no Christianity.  If bitcoin's 21 million cap can be changed, u have no digital gold. 
Yet, as crucial as this issue is, the people in this thread keep using the logic that bitcoin is what it claims to be because I am smarter than you.  Whether or not the 21 million can be changed does not depend on how much smarter u are than other people.   In fact, this type of attitude is what leads to endless forking and dilution. 
This is similar to Christians who act like they are better than everyone else even though they don't care about who Jesus Christ really was.

miners have to make a physical commitment to mining by buying and upgrading equipment.  if the supply/demand changes, the equipment is already bought.  the supply of bitcoins to miners have to remain above a certain level beyond just supply / demand for them to stay in business.

it still can be changed.  it may be hidden in a math formula but the formula can be changed.
