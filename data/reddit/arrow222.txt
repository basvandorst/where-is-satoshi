It's indistinguishable from a normal server posting API to their servers.
However for the free edition of the app, it's possible they can ban that IP address since they can figure out the IP. 
But users who paid for a private version and run it on their own servers, it cannot be distinguished.

I personally won't. 
But given that sites like MyEtherWallet are extremely popular, and people making $50 trades purchases can save 40x on fees ($1.99 vs $0.05), I'm sure it will be useful for someone. 
Users should also disable withdrawals on their api keys, and there's no way to steal funds.

It is. Use at your own risk.
For a $10k trade, the savings is $190. One could create an API key with withdraws disabled, make the trade, and delete the key within 10 seconds.

That means no bots will market make for them, liquidity and trading volume will drop sharply.

If I'm asked to shut it down, it will just be a private tool for people I know. If the api-key is set to disable withdraws, it's not possible for funds to be stolen however.

I'm also helping to setup private servers/dashboards for individual active traders to use on AWS, this way they control the servers and api-keys never leave their ownership.

Because there will be people who will use it.
There's people willing to pay for a privately hosted solution, where they control the servers and full ownership of the api-keys. 
Lastly this will be very helpful if I decide to work at a crypto exchange as a software engineer. :)
