I think it's odd that the article suggests the possibility of a crack down on tor when tor was created by the US Navy to prevent government spying on Internet users in foreign countries. It would be odd to see the US government push it in some countries but seek to spy on it in their own

Well If he is, the major news media will launch a crusade against bitcoin that's for sure.

The only thing I worry about there is the word unhackable, because nothing true ever is. I do think a high security Wallet that is simple to use would be a great product though.

While I realize that this is not likely to pass, I believe that even having this be exist is good for bitcoin. It helps build the recognition and force people to at least talk about it.

Can you stop pretending like anyone thinks he was doing this as an act of charity ? 
It was a business that made money, that's what businesses do, no one expects business to be charities so please stop with that

I'll grant you that using the word "forced" may have been ambiguous there. What I am saying is that before people have heard about something they have no incentive or way to learn about it. Even after they learn about it if it just seems like something that investors or young people on the internet are involved with, they may have little interest in seeking out to make up their opinion in it. When it comes from the government, they may just want to know what all the take is about.
However I would say that there is a giant difference in accepting bitcoin for taxes and accepting the Vietnamese Dong. That difference is that the Dong is the fiat currency of Vietnam, where as bitcoin is a decentralized cryptocurrency and thus not issued or controlled by any government. It would be odd for a country to accept payment in a currency controlled by a different nation (at least in the west), but to accept a cryptocurrency is a different question entirely.
