Face to face meetups have more of a risk of robbery / mugging if you're going to be showing up with a known amount of cash.
Use the same common sense you would with meeting some random person on craigslist. Meet in a well-lit, public area, maybe with lots of cameras or security. Maybe bring a friend along.
Seems like the chances of something bad happening are low, but just be smart and safe about it.

Just about any service that lets you purchase large amounts of BTC needs time to verify your identity and financial information.
Often times, you need to give them lots of personal information like a photo of your driver license (or other government-issued ID), bank account info, phone number, address, etc.
The services that require less personal information usually don't let you purchase large amounts per day.

If this is your primary concern, then use this:
**Edit:** Also, if you use a web wallet like blockchain.info, your IP won't be recorded in the bitcoin blockchain (the public ledger). The IP recorded will instead be blockchain.info's.
However, blockchain.info does record your IP address. It's possible, however unlikely, that a government agency could force blockchain.info to give them IP address information associated with a particular account.

At this point, if you pay for electricity, then you will never be profitable.
If for whatever reason you don't pay for electricity, you *may* be able to turn a profit *if*:
* You buy used, working GPUs at low prices
* You already have existing computers (motherboard / CPU / RAM / power supply / etc.) to run the GPUs
* You're able to re-sell the GPUs once the difficulty spikes up to extremely high levels
Even with all this, your profit margins will likely be razor thin. The time you spend setting all this up, maintaining it and eventually re-selling the equipment will be non-trivial. Basically, this will be a neat hobby that might net you a few bitcents. You will not become rich mining with GPUs.

I highly prefer reddit's format compared to traditional forums.
However, bitcointalk.org has way more people there.
More people = better content.
@_date: 2013-03-11 03:37:39
If you wanted to permanently give your wallet to your friend you could.
That would be like giving someone the password to your reddit account and then that person changes the password so you can't access it any more.
There wouldn't be any public record of that transfer.
However, most of the time, you're just going to want to send bitcoins from one address (yours) to another (your friend's).
This transaction is public. Anyone can see that 1 BTC was sent from one address to another.
However, there's not necessarily any available information tying your identity to your address, and your friend's identity too his address.
Transactions are public, but address ownership or control is anonymous unless you publicly give out that information.
You can trace **all** bitcoin transactions back to their origin (the miner block reward).
If anonymity is a big concern, there are services that "mix" bitcoins for you when you send them from one address to another. These services send your coins through a large number of shared wallets, making the transaction between address X and address Y very difficult to trace.
**Edit:** now that I think of it, you should never trust anyone giving you their wallet.dat file as a payment. There's no guarantee that the person who originally had the wallet doesn't still have a copy of that wallet's private keys.
tl;dr: just send coins to people if you want to transfer ownership of them.

* Coinbase has been out of BTC for a while. 
* No one is close to me on localbitcoins.com.

I guess this might be a good *optional* feature for online communities that currently use captchas to prevent spam.
It'd probably make sense to fund your hypothetical forum account with something like 0.1 BTC (this would be the only transaction in the actual blockchain) and each post deducts some small amount (~0.0001 BTC?) from your balance on the site you're using.
Although, I don't really participate in any online communities that have a major problem with spam, so I'm not sure if implementing something like this would be worth it. Maybe.

As a fourth generation Silicon Valley VC, Adam Draper has early stage tech investing in his blood. Or as the subheader of his personal blog reads: “I have two missions in life: Help entrepreneurs and build an Iron Man suit.”
The son of Draper Fisher Jurvetson (DFJ) co-founder Tim Draper, the 26-year-old has already dabbled in operating a secondary market for startup shares and briefly launched his own equity crowdfunding portal, until market conditions and family legal concerns ended both projects shortly after they began. Draper’s current project, a startup accelerator loosely affiliated with his father’s entrepreneurial university, seems like the best idea of the bunch and is about to get significantly more interesting with its second class.
San Mateo-based Boost VC offers not only pre-Seed investment, office space, and mentorship, but also housing, hosting all participants in an on-site hotel. The accelerator is currently accepting applications for its class beginning June 24, and, in an unexpected wrinkle, Draper has decided to focus part of the class on technologies associated with the Bitcoin virtual currency. He plans to admit five to seven Bitcoin-related startups out of the 15-company class.
In the lead-up to the June 1 application deadline, Draper has come up with a number of creative ideas for recruiting Bitcoin startups. For example, he will host a hackathon at the “Bitcoin 2013: The Future of Payments” conference, held in San Jose May 17–19.
The accelerator founder writes on his blog that the current climate around Bitcoin reminds him of the “Wild West” days of peer-to-peer file sharing kicked off by Napster, but that a renaissance in the next few years will formalize Bitcoin into a digital currency standard. Boost VC is hoping to play a role in that process.
“There is a thriving hacker community behind Bitcoin, there are purchases being made with it (some of them legitimate), and there is $300 million worth of Bitcoin,” Draper writes. “It is becoming readily available to the common Internet user rather than just hackers. I believe that this movement will spur not only the iTunes of Bitcoin, but an entire economy of ideas.”
It may be the early days of Bitcoin, but some important groups are already taking it seriously. The Internet Archive recently began paying its employees in the virtual currency and is soliciting donations by the same method.
Draper points out that the nascent digital currency already has a number of appealing qualities. Bitcoin can be transferred anywhere in the world within minutes with negligible fees, and it is not dependent on any company or government to maintain its value. The system also incorporates a fixed and known inflation rate, based on the total number of Bitcoins that will ever be created.
The currency is also difficult to track, although not entirely anonymous, and is held up by its supporters as impossible to counterfeit – which is surely a welcome challenge to some. Furthermore, unlike bank accounts and merchant accounts (ahem, Paypal), Bitcoin accounts cannot be frozen and transactions cannot be blocked or reversed.
Many of the above attributes are both advantages and disadvantages when considering it as an alternative global currency. Governments, for example, fear its inability to be tracked, while many advocates consider that its greatest strength. And there has already been a multi-million dollar fraud in the Bitcoin ecosystem, which has left some people on edge.
But many of these attributes, positive and negative, are also enormous opportunities for startups to create new and innovative services that make the currency more efficient, more liquid, and more secure. Draper sees an opportunity to invest in and nurture several of these ideas through Boost VC, and he has already made its first investment in the ecosystem, backing Y Combinator alumni digital wallet platform Coinbase.
It will likely be years before anyone knows if Bitcoin lives up to its promise of becoming a ubiquitous, global alternative currency. What is all but certain is that if this promise is to become a reality, it will take the foresight and backing of countless entrepreneurs and investors along the way. In that sense, Boost is well ahead of its time. For Adam Draper, however, the risk is that he may be too far ahead.

Read this if you haven't already:
If you think that the "Bitcoin Days" or "Bitcoin Days Destroyed" metric is important or want to alter it, older coins could be worth more.
Also, recently-mined coins need a certain number of confirmations (120 I think, not sure) before they can be sent to another address. So, those coins, during that period, aren't as useful as older ones.
Another thing is there may be collector-type people that might want to possess bitcoins that can be traced all the way back to the first 10,000 blocks mined (or whatever arbitrary number). This would be like having an antique gun with a really low serial number or something like that.

Miners also receive the all transaction fees in the blocks they mine.
In the distant future, when the block reward is 0 (or so low it's insignificant), the idea is that it'll still be worth mining because the transaction fees will be high enough to keep funding mining operations.

Currently, if there is a big sell-off, I'll probably just buy more. A vast majority of my coins are in cold storage. Prevents me from gambling them as well as panic selling them on price dips.
Also, my break-even price is $27. If the price shoots down that low, holy crap...

Here's how bitcoin handles it:
@_date: 2013-03-09 08:16:50
I keep a pretty detailed ledger of my usage.
I've spent 32.19% of all the coins I've acquired.
I keep track of how much the USD value of the coins was at the time of spending, as well as what the coins would be worth now had I not spent them.
Since the value of bitcoin went up so much since I had spent them, it feels like the amount of money I spent was more than it really was.
However, this is a negative way of looking at the situation.
Another way I see this is I saved 67.81% of the coins I've acquired. The value of those coins went up, giving me a net gain that is valued as more than the total cost of the items I purchased. "Free" items and "free" money.
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:58:59

SSDs are awesome. I have one as my primary OS drive. It's only 80GB, so I have to be really careful to only put critical data on it.
By default the bitcoin client uses that AppData folder to store the blockchain.
This was not an option for me. The client actually stopped downloading the blockchain for me because I ran out of storage.
I also have a standard internal HDD in my compter that is 1TB for mass storage. My SSD is drive C: and D: is assigned to the 1TB HDD. Here's what I did to get the blockchain files to be stored on the larger, slower drive:
* Stop and fully close the bitcoin client
* Move the client program files folder here: *D:\Program Files\bitcoin*
* Create an empty text file in that directory called: *bitcoin-qt.bat*
* Open that file in notepad and paste this text in and save it: *bitcoin-qt.exe -datadir=data*
* Create a folder in *D:\Program Files\bitcoin* called: *data*
* Move the blockchain files from *C:\Users\\{username}\AppData\Roaming\Bitcoin* to *D:\Program Files\bitcoin\data*
* From now on, when you want to start the bitcoin client, double click the *bitcoin-qt.bat* file you created.
If you do all this, the blockchain files will be stored on a drive that isn't your tiny SSD.
It's important to note that if you accidentally open *bitcoin-qt.exe* instead of *bitcoin-qt.bat*, the client will start to download the entire blockchain to your C: drive again.
Also, if you don't have any other drives besides your SSD, none of this will work.

Can you manually decrypt the wallet.aes.json file?
If you do, you can probably open that file up in a text editor and hopefully extract your private key(s).
The JSON data format is fairly easy to read.
Once you have your private keys, you should be able import them directly into whatever bitcoin client you want with ease.
Something like this:
...should be able to decrypt that file.
You can load that page, then disconnect your computer from the internet if you're extra paranoid.
Do be careful with handling any unencrypted private keys.

You seem like you might be a good person to ask this:
The BTC market is for the most part "free &amp; unregulated."
No one has to worry about bending or breaking laws or pissing off the SEC.
So, are there any current things that would be illegal to do on a stock / forex / commodity trading platform that are possible with BTC? Specifically, dishonest, dirty tricks that can turn a quick profit that aren't allowed in "real" markets.

With all of the recent (2013) price drops, there was always a quick correction back to the original price or even higher.
If you look at the 2013 BTC/USD candlestick chart, nearly all large red bars are quickly followed by equally large green bars.
Buy orders for values lower than market price are just hoping for this trend to occur again so the trader can buy more BTC at a discounted rate.
@_date: 2013-03-27 02:39:22
I do this too. Although, I use 0.01 BTC with a 0.0005 BTC transaction fee. 1 BTC is a lot to loose in a test!
If I ever transfer more that about 1 BTC to a new address, I make sure I have the private key in physical form stored in a very safe location.
I also store the encrypted wallet.dat in an encrypted .7z archive (with a different password) on my local HDD, Google Drive and DropBox.

I suggest comparing bitcoin with [Libertarianism]( and [Anarchism]( instead of liberalism and neo-marxism.
Talk about what money actually is. Bring up the aspects and properties of things like gold, fiat currency and bitcoin such as: scarcity, durability, store of value, divisibility, fungibility, etc.
Decentralization is an important topic. The concept in general is somewhat recent in our history.
Sorry I'm a bit tired right now, I might post something better tomorrow. I suggest looking at sites that try to explain what bitcoin is, and getting ideas (don't directly copy though) from them. Something like this: 
@_date: 2013-05-03 11:53:00
Completely normal.
A block should be found every 10 minutes *on average*.
This means sometimes it'll take less than a minute to solve a block.
And other times it'll take 90 minutes or more.

The difficulty adjusts every 2016 blocks, so a sudden increase in hashing power won't have much of an effect on the rate at which bitcoins are mined.

Thanks. I figured that'd get downvoted, but I don't care in this case.
The thing people don't seem to understand is that bitcoin is a lot like bearer instruments (whoever holds it, owns it).
Through whatever means (guessing brainwallets, etc.), if I generate a private key to an address with a non-zero balance, I control that address unquestionably. Having a private key is equivalent to holding cash or a bearer bond.
The odd thing with bitcoin is, multiple entities can control an address. It becomes a race to see who can transfer the funds to a new address and get the transaction confirmed.

I don't think BFL is a scam.
However, they have an extremely strong reputation for missing projected dates.
Once people actually start getting their ASICs and their production process is smoothed out, I think their estimates will be more accurate.
For their SC Single and Little SC Single, I really would not expect for the device to pay for itself in less than a year if you order now. However, that's still not necessarily a terrible investment.

I wouldn't use the tip account as your primary place to store your BTC.
All someone would need is your reddit password to take your money.
Also, you're relying on reddit.com and the bitcointip bot being online and functioning to access your money. Neither of those are guaranteed.
It's free to create a more secure address somewhere else (blockchain.info, paper wallet, Armory, etc.).
You don't need a verified account on an exchange to have bitcoins.
The verified account only exists so you can convert USD to BTC and BTC to USD online.
Transferring bitcoins from one address (person's account) to another is unregulated. Anyone can do it without restriction.

It's their automated fraud-prevention software.
It's not like an actual human flagged your order as potentially fraudulent.
They've been saying that fraud (mainly, people doing chargebacks on them) is definitely an issue for them. Currently, their automated fraud protection is a little bit overzealous. They've said, however, as time goes on, their system for detecting potential fraud will get better, and this will happen less for legitimate transactions.
I'd definitely recommend contacting customer support though. Sometimes they can manually whitelist your account so this won't happen.

You need *both* to reliably mail someone something. If you try to mail something to someone without using a first &amp; last name that's commonly used at that address, it can arouse suspicion. Obviously fake names (John Doe, Mister Mann, etc.) are especially dangerous to use.

Some people will use PayPal's "gift" feature (irreversible transaction) to send USD to your account and you sent them your BTC.
The risk of getting ripped is on the person who sends the money first.
Whoever sends the money first must trust the other party.
Generally, you won't get full market price for your coins selling this way.
If you think I'm trustworthy, I'll buy your 2 BTC from you (if you send them to me first) @ mtgox weighted average minus 1%. The only thing I have to offer as far as trust goes is this is my primary reddit account, and if I rip you off, this account would be flagged as a scammer account by the reddit community.
IIRC, there are some 3rd party services that try to facilitate and maybe even escrow these kinds of deals for a fee.
**Edit:** You also pay PalPal 2.9% + $0.30 for receiving a "gift" payment, if I'm reading things correctly. I've never actually done this before.
* current mtgox weighted average: $131.57332
* minus 1%: $130.2575868
* times 2 BTC: $260.5151736
* paypal gift amount I send: $260.52
* amount you receive (I think): $260.52 - 2.9% - 0.30 = $252.66
**Edit 2:** It looks like "gift" payments through PayPal might be free if they're under a certain amount and the payer funds with a bank account and not a credit card. If a credit card is used, the sender pays the fee.
I can't find any info that says PayPal gifts are reversible through PayPal.

This doesn't directly translate to number of bitcoin users, but it is a larger number than I was expecting.

Are there other factors that might make a single bitcoin client / user use a large number of IP addresses?
@_date: 2013-05-23 15:40:05
Yes, for every Satoshi Dice bet, there are two transactions in the blockchain:
1. The user sending the bet amount to S.DICE
2. S.DICE sending an amount back to the user (a very small amount is sent back when a losing bet occurs)
The minimum losing amount used to be one satoshi. Recently, this amount has been increased to 5430 satoshis. The formula used for the losing amount sent back is MAX(0.0000543, (0.005 * bet amount) - 0.0005). So a loss on a 0.01 BTC bet would return 0.0000543 BTC. A loss on a 0.5 BTC bet would return 0.002 BTC.
The way S.DICE is "provably fair" is because it uses the blockchain itself as a component of the proof for each bet. This is why each bet involves two transactions.
There are other similar bitcoin betting sites that use a method like you were suggesting: fund your account with bitcoin, gamble for a while, then withdraw your balance when you're finished.
If I remember correctly said that a method similar to that is being developed for S.DICE as well.

I think DPR thought that merely having contraband mailed to your home wasn't enough for law enforcement to do anything about it. It was the whole idea of: anyone can mail some drugs to your house, there's no way to prove it was you that ordered it. You could just as easily send a gram of meth to a police chief's home, with his name on it.
It's a bit different with fake IDs though. Drugs are one thing, but having a bunch of fake IDs with your photo on them sent to your house is a little harder to deny that it wasn't your doing. That, *and* it was an international shipment (Canada to US), so it goes through customs. They probably never would have intercepted those fake IDs if it was just domestic mail (unless they were already *really* watching him closely by that time).

I do realize that I'd be *significantly* more wealthy if I would have bought $778 worth of BTC on 2012-12-12.
However, paying $778 for a BFL pre-order wasn't my only bitcoin investment. I've spent much more than $778 on buying bitcoins directly when the price was &lt; $20.
The BFL pre-order was a risk. As things have turned out, it was *not* the best thing I could have done with $778 on 2012-12-12. However, I don't consider it a failure either.
@_date: 2013-03-20 16:11:05
My understanding is that people can create automated scripts or programs that look for differences in the quotes and prices at different exchanges (MtGox, btc-e, etc.).
If there's a big enough price disparity between two exchanges, you can simultaneously execute a buy order on one exchange and a sell order on another and make a little bit of profit.
Since the market moves so quickly, this can usually only be done by computers. Humans can't react quickly enough.

If you lose, satoshi dice still sends you back bitcoin.
For smaller bets, it's usually just 0.00000001 BTC.
That response lets you know the transaction went through, but you lost.
In most cases, your satoshi dice bet results *should* come back within a couple seconds.
There are a few things that can make the response time much longer:
* Betting coins you recently received, especially if those coins have no confirmations or very few confirmations
* Not including a transaction fee, or using a transaction fee that is too low. Generally, a transaction fee of 0.0005 BTC is sufficient, but sometimes you need to use 0.001 BTC if your transaction has a lot of inputs or outputs.
* Betting a large amount (usually 1 BTC or more), or betting against the very large payouts. In these cases, satoshi dice tends to wait until your transaction has been included in at least one block. This is to minimize the risk of double spending large amounts. On average, one block is generated every ten minutes. Sometimes it's 3 minutes, sometimes it's 30 minutes or more.

@_date: 2013-05-22 17:19:54
Yeah, it's most likely this.
A similar thing can happen with blocks that are mined. The timestamp uses the miner's local machine clock. Sometimes this can make the timestamp on blocks not be in chronological order. In this case, however, there's a maximum timespan the time difference can be for valid blocks. A block with a 1982 timestamp would not be a valid block.
I'm not sure who's clock gets used for the timestamp on transactions. I assume it's the first node that relays the transaction.

Even with a very strong passphrase, the amount of entropy and security involved with brainwallets is much less than a truly random private key.
Just by messing around with guessing movie, video game and book quotes, I've found 5 brainwallets with a non-empty transaction history. One brainwallet used an Ayn Rand quote that was over 40 characters long. That's a seemingly super-strength passphrase.
I know others have been using programs using password dictionary words to generate brainwallet private keys and check for non-empty transaction history as well.

57.63 BTC to be exact (I paid for express shipping so the total was $778).
It is important to note I did also buy BTC in January 2013 when the price was $13-$20. I didn't put all my eggs into the BFL basket.
Unfortunately I also bought BTC in each following month as well, even when it was ~$250.

How much is a BFL 30GH/s miner selling for right now?
@_date: 2013-04-11 22:27:23
I'm becoming more and more convinced the price will crash pretty hard when MtGox re-opens.
* The other exchanges are at $60-$65 right now.
* MtGox shut down at $120
* MtGox isn't going to re-open with an empty order book. They *are* giving users the chance to cancel any open or pending orders, but not everyone is going to have the opportunity to do this.
* If you have BTC on gox and are one of the first people to successfully execute a market sell order, you may be able to get some of the "old" bids that were left on there that are well above the other exchanges' rates of $60-$65.
* So it would seem, that there'd be a race to execute market sell orders. Obviously though, everyone placing market sell orders at the same time all at once will tank the price like crazy. Who knows how low it'll go.
@_date: 2013-03-11 17:54:00
In my opinion, this is the motivation behind at least some of the trolls (who have a BFL pre-order, but probably won't admit to it):
* People are waiting in the BFL pre-order queue.
* If a person who submitted their pre-order before you did cancels it, you move up one position in the line.
* The sooner you get your pre-order, the more money your make.
* It is in your best interest to get as many people as possible to cancel their pre-order.
* Therefore: spreading as much FUD about BFL can indirectly get you more money.
Even if a person with a pre-order is behind you in the queue, a pre-order cancellation can still benefit you because there will be theoretically less total hashing power on the network. Less ASICs shipped means a lower difficulty.
@_date: 2013-04-15 15:58:58
I think maybe there could be some kind of compromise if their system wasn't in such a poor state:

@_date: 2013-03-21 05:10:49
The only thing that determines the price is the market.
Supply and demand. Economics. Theoretically, there's no hard limit to the price of one bitcoin.
If the price went up to $100k per coin, you'd probably see people referring to units like mBTC (0.001 BTC) or even satoshis (0.00000001 BTC) instead of whole bitcoins.
If the price was $100k per coin, the standard transaction fee would be $50 (0.0005 BTC). That *might* be an issue. The transaction fee amount might be changed if the price went that high.

Two things put me at ease with this:

Despite this, it is definitely easy for someone holding 100k BTC to crash the entire market in mere seconds.

My personal view is if "spamming the blockchain" is a problem, then the problem is with bitcoin and the blockchain itself, not company x, user y or group z.
Since there's no central control, we cannot rely on "regulating" what is a valid use of bitcoin.
That being said, I actually don't disagree with the recent changes regarding "dust" transactions. We must do what's best in the short term, and I think that's an okay solution for now.

This is true.
Today's order was a little smaller than Tuesday and Wednesday (those were for ~20k BTC).
However, it's pretty interesting that there's been consistent large market buy orders around this time of the day for the past 3 days now.
@_date: 2013-05-21 14:50:27
But I would assume most of the volume is market buys though.
If a market sell order for ~400 shares would tank the price, this is the only thing that'd make sense unless I'm not getting something here......

Thanks for the heads up, OP.
I use localbitcoins very frequently, and the potential for receiving counterfeit bills has always been a concern of mine.
I've not done anything about it so far, but I think I will now.
I'm not really sure how I'd react if I did test the cash, and it turned out the person I met had fake money. Seems like it'd be really awkward, and the other person might get offended or even angry.

Prices tend to be based on 24-hour averages.
Sellers can hedge their prices for even more stability and less risk.
There's actually not much risk to buyers if they immediately spend their coins.

Yeah, my BFL pre-order was done with PayPal backed by a credit card.
Two ways to reverse the charge on my end.
However, I think it's a lot harder for me to reverse the charge now since it's been more than 45 days since the transaction occurred.
I know there's lots of BFL hate, but I do still think they'll *eventually* ship a real, working ASIC.

The current p2p network through which the blockchain is shared and downloaded is much slower than bittorrent in my experience. ~16GB shouldn't take 3 days to download.
Personally, in the past, I've just copied my /data directory on an external HDD and let my friends borrow it to copy on to their computers. This method is very fast, but only works for people you can meet face-to-face.

No. ASICs improve the robustness of the network, adding confidence in bitcoin. Added confidence in bitcoin generally translates to a higher price.
The only thing related to ASICs that I think could decrease $/BTC would be that the people who are mining with ASICs sell all their BTC they earn as soon as they earn it.
It will be interesting to see what the majority of ASIC miners decide to do.
Will they hold on to their BTC for longer-term gains ($/BTC goes up), or will they want to cash out as fast as possible ($/BTC goes down)?

The blockchain.info web wallet is limited with that address. There's not much you can do with it.

I'm not sure if I want to import into my bitcoin-qt client. It might freak out.
@_date: 2013-05-17 00:58:55
I was thinking about making a transaction that would send one satoshi to a random address and then make the transaction fee as large as I could without exceeding the maximum block size limit.
If the transaction were to be mined, the block would have two transactions, the block reward to the miner, and the one with the huge fee.
@_date: 2013-03-11 01:59:10
Does it take longer and longer as it gets closer to the current block?

On my transaction that's taking hours to confirm, the size is 1877 bytes, so I should have used a fee of 0.001 BTC not 0.0005 BTC.

That was a potential issue.
Because the problem didn't get really bad, none of that happened.

I don't pay for electricity.
This is a legit agreement with my landlord and building. The building I live in wasn't built to have individual meters for each unit, so nobody pays *directly* for electricity. For me, it is included in my monthly rent, and will never change, no matter how much power I use. This is in my rental agreement, and I am constantly looking for ways to take advantage of free electricity. For right now, it is just liberal usage of heating and cooling as well as 24/7 bitcoin mining.
Also, by February 2014, no one knows what the BTC/USD exchange rate will be. It could be $20 or it could be $400. It's impossible to know how much USD my Little Single will produce by that time if I do not sell the BTC it makes.
@_date: 2013-03-07 02:02:49
Eh, no big deal.
The price can drop all the way to $26.50 and I'll still be in the green overall.
Plus, at least for now, the price is back up above $40, so that's not too terrible.

That's not part of the criteria for a valid block.
It's unreasonable to force all miner's clocks to be synchronized.
There are many instances of timestamps not being in chronological order in the blockchain.

Google Docs spreadsheet.
Many of my fields are calculated.
I'm trying to keep the number of manually-entered fields to a minimum. 
@_date: 2013-05-14 15:28:17
The timestamp used for blocks comes from the miner's local machine, not a central time server.
Sometimes people's clocks are off.
**Edit**, here's the details:


**A timestamp is accepted as valid if it is greater than the median timestamp of previous 11 blocks, and less than the network-adjusted time + 2 hours. "Network-adjusted time" is the median of the timestamps returned by all nodes connected to you.**
Whenever a node connects to another node, it gets a UTC timestamp from it, and stores its offset from node-local UTC. The network-adjusted time is then the node-local UTC plus the median offset from all connected nodes. Network time is never adjusted more than 70 minutes from local system time, however.
Bitcoin uses an unsigned integer for the timestamp, so the year 2038 problem is delayed for another 68 years.

@_date: 2013-02-28 04:08:22
Is there a lot of opposition, or arguments against bitcoin from the left?
I tend to consider myself libertarian (liberal on social policies, conservative on economic policies) for the most part.
Personally, though, things like keeping abortion legal, keeping anti-evolution / creationism out of science class, legalizing gay marriage, etc. are far more important issues for me compared to monetary policy.
I tend to think that no matter how bad government fucks shit up for us, there's *always* going to opportunities out there for me to make money and be successful. 2008-present has actually been the most prosperous time in my life (context: I was born in 1984).
If I'm going to come up with arguments to convince people to think the way I do, and adopt and embrace something like bitcoin, I first need to understand their current state of mind and beliefs.
What exactly are we trying to convince them?
What is it about their beliefs that prevents them from adopting, or at least accepting bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-03-12 07:27:45

As far as the BFL fiasco goes, I'm just glad I actually received something, and it works as advertised. Some people were *absolutely* convinced BFL was a total scam and would never even deliver a working product at all.

The rate at which bitcoins are mined isn't affected (very much) by the network hash rate.
The difficulty adjusts every 2016 blocks.

I've used a couple of these just to see what it was about.
There's a few services that give you a tiny amount of BTC for doing things like solving captchas, looking at ads, watching videos, staying on pages for a certain amount of time, etc.
I'm not sure how much you value your time, but this stuff is just not worth it for me. Even I managed to optimize my efficiency, I doubt I'd ever be able to make more than the BTC equivalent of $1 per hour.
Also, with these kind of sites, you really have to be careful about phishing attempts, viruses, malware, spam, etc.

I'm not 100% sure, but I think the information came from one specific, very popular, high traffic Silk Road dealer whose computer and network security was sub-par.
The SR dealer's computer was compromised and a massive list of names and addresses that dealer had done business with was stolen.
This security breach had little to do with the Silk Road website and how it works. It was an error on the dealer's part, by not handling that data properly.

Depends on the transaction. Can you post your transaction's link on blockchain.info?
It would look like this:
Typically you need to include a 0.0005 BTC fee for processing in a reasonable amount of time.
If the total transaction size in bytes is 1000 bytes or larger, you need to include an additional 0.0005 BTC fee for each 1000 bytes.
* 534 byte transaction: 0.0005 BTC fee
* 2100 byte transaction: 0.0015 BTC fee
* 1024 byte transaction: 0.001 BTC fee
If you don't include these transaction fees, your transaction receives a very low priority to be included in a block by the miners.
Transaction priority increases with the age of the transaction. Eventually old, no-fee, low-priority transactions will be included in a block if they've been waiting for a long time.
I'd expect the transaction to be confirmed within about 24 hours. For me, it's usually closer to 10 hours if I didn't include the right fee.
@_date: 2013-03-06 17:26:34
Yeah, I think they edited the article.
@_date: 2013-04-11 21:20:43
The volume is too low, the order book is too thin, the fees are too high and the transfer time between exchanges is too long.
I'm not saying you can't arbitrage right now, but it's super risky.

This is really splitting hairs, but all blocks have at least one transaction.
The block reward being sent to the miner's address.
I do remember seeing a block like this once while just staring at the homepage of blockchain.info.

Correct. I also posted this same chart for the Jalapeño as a reply to my original comment.

I don't really care Wired is burning the BTC they're mining.
Less available BTC = increased scarcity = higher price.
It is BS though, how BFL claims they are "shipping units."
Sure it's better than nothing, but a handful of 5 GH/s devices sent to some key players doesn't count.

@_date: 2013-03-12 06:41:47
You picked a very interesting minute to start with.
This is a good place to start:
Just try to use it like you would wikipedia.
You'll need other resources if you want more detailed information though.
As far as mining goes, try to read about the blockchain, transactions and the origin of all coins.
tl;dr on mining is that you can use computer power to support a network and get paid for doing that with bitcoin. if you pay for electricity, you might be losing money doing this, since high powered computers use a lot of it.

Here are some examples of who deals with very large transactions, and/or high volume:
* Exchanges (MtGox, bicoin-24, bitfloor, btc-e, etc.)
* Buying / selling services (coinbase, bitinstant, etc.)
* Mining pools (btc guild, slush, 50btc, etc.)
* Silk Road stuff
* Gambling sites
* Rich people

I paid them using PayPal funded from a credit card.
I figured that was the best option since it gave me the most protection and I didn't have to worry about BTC/USD price fluctuation.

I can vouch for this site and its service.
It is very good.
@_date: 2013-03-12 07:15:29
It might have something to do with this:
MtGox stopped all deposits because of that.
I think the exchanges are temporarily putting things on hold until they know they are okay.
@_date: 2013-05-06 21:52:00
I agree with your perspective.
Nice username by the way.

1. Open an account on an exchange.
2. Give the exchange enough personal and financial info to completely steal your identity.
3. Wait several days for your exchange account to get "verified."
4. Transfer the coins you have to the exchange.
5. Sell the coins for USD on the exchange.
6. Transfer your USD from the exchange to your checking account.
7. Wait several days for that deposit to your checking account to clear.
8. Next year: pay income or capital gains tax on that credit to your checking account.
Go on [localbitcoins.com]( and have an internet stranger hand you cash for your coins.

What VM do you use? And what CPU do you have?
I've never been able to get an x64 version of Linux to work in a VM with my computer (Win7 Ultimate x64).
I forget the specific error, but it seems to not like my hardware, or at least the default settings.
My CPU an Intel i7 920 if that helps at all.
I might try to get that working again. In general, I've been wanting to increase my familiarity with Linux. I've not really done much with it.

Any chance he could have sneaked in a key logger during that time?
@_date: 2013-03-06 06:23:41
Haha, he totally is.
Since the price went to ~$44, he's now trying everything he can to buy the rest of my BTC!
Honestly, I don't really want to sell though.
Coinbase is out of coins right now, and I don't have any other reliable way to lock in the current price.
He's still in the waiting / verification process to buy his own.

Virtex recently announced they're planning on offering the ability to short BTC on their exchange.
The flip-side to that is you'll also be able to securely loan out your BTC @ 12% (to the shorters).

I also agree that the reason for transaction cancellation is not for their own personal gain.
Their public response is simply that their automated fraud detection algorithms are a bit overzealous.
They're a small business and need to limit their risk as much as they can.
I've personally had a transaction for 10 BTC cancelled at the last second by them.
I locked in the price of about $32 / BTC.
At the time of cancellation, the price was about $45 / BTC.
Customer service resolved my issue, and I eventually got my BTC I ordered for the price I originally was quoted.
I'm very happy with coinbase so far.

The original pricing was like this too.
I am not sure why they did that. You'd expect the $ per GH/s to be a little higher for the lower hash rate model.
@_date: 2013-03-21 03:52:39
Have you contacted them at all?
I had one of my transactions cancelled at the last second (10 BTC @ $32 each, price went up to like $45 while waiting for confirmation).
Customer service resolved my issue and they gave me my 10 BTC at the original price quote.

Take the money and run.
Also, don't brag about it (well at least the specific amount, or what wallet it was anyway).
