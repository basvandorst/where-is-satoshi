Buying from Coinbase and storing your bitcoin locally seems pretty damn easy to me. But what do I know?

I went to Vegas 2 weekends ago and had a really hard time finding someone in the Golden Gate who knew what bitcoin was. I ended up having to spend fiat after a frustration experience, despite their sign. 
Is there some trick to spending nerd money there? Their staff needs training.
