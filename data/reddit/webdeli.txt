We're of the opinion no.

I wonder if the original quote is mischaracterizing Charlie Shrem's action as the source of the 'black eye' - surely the Mt.Gox events and US State's persecution of Charlie Shrem gave rise to bruising public relations and messaging. It would be surprising to me if Gavin Andersen had communicated what the author has written - but of course, if the author has the quotes and what is written is an accurate representation of Gavin's views, then so be it.

Nope. That's [these guys]( For me it's strictly an amateur hobby. Not a [professional enterprise](

There is a credible argument for Agorism and the power of the state flow from our capitulation to adopting the money they put forward for us to use. Abandoning the dollar may be the most important possible act.

It based on the original artwork of another designer, so I can't talk to her/his original thoughts on that. For my part I like that is in a form and format that closely associated with Bitcoin as the use-case is most commonly going to be where Bitcoin is taken by a merchant.
Additionally - As Bitcoin is the best global payment platform it's spreading use and adoption will likely see this form increasingly associated with payment at point of sale, be it online or in person.

Hi Everyone, So at [Web Deli™]( we are officially going Bitcoin exclusive and we need to clearly display our ["DOLLARS NOT ACCEPTED"]( policy online and on printed material.
Based on a design first seen on [Bitcoins Not Bombs]( - we have lovingly recreated the artwork including in scaleable vector form and released here for the community to enjoy.

On the practical side - as open artwork - in vector form, changing the color to anything you want is permissible and possible.
For my own application and use - I like the subversive effect and subtle inversion of logic that the green (means: money, go) used as a prohibition notice has. It requires cognitive parsing. I am conscious of that. I am ok with that.
But to repeat the above - it can be made any color you want for sure.

Barter without Bitcoin is economically inefficient - society needs a money to deal with the co-incidence of wants. For an awesome podcast on this - I recommend this recent show (Nov 2015) produced by [Jeffrey Tucker - What Has Government Done to Our Money?](
