I have held exactly 0.000139 BTC in my Coinbase account, and got the same amount in BCH when the fork happened. So that's 0.000139 BCH. WOW! **I truly must be a “BCash kiddo”**! Now I'd appreciate if you'd stop being a douche to me. I got the "Core" name from [the Bitcoin GitHub repo itself](

[You will never convince anyone if you don’t show them you understood their arguments]( Blatantly disregarding beliefs isn’t going to help them agree with your point.

Yes, but DO NOT root your device.

You have seen what the Ripple &amp; altcoins debacle did. Except for us geeks, the public’s main interest in cryptocurrencies lies in “get rich quick” schemes. Bullish technology or not, people are greedy and they are not going to want to invest in a technology which “only” offers “small” returns. [People even invested in PonziCoin.](

Have you checked the very high entry price for developers, though? It takes $25000 to create a smart contract on the main net ([500 GAS]( at [$50 per unit](

Thanks for educating me! I wasn't aware there was a difference between Bitcoin and Bitcoin Core, I've been taught terms are interchangeable.

If you live in Europe, you can't use Gemini.

"When that runs out, the system can support transaction fees if needed. It's based on open market competition, and there will probably always be nodes willing to process transactions for free."
Yeah right.

With a hardware wallet, nobody and nothing can see your private key. So you can use your funds on your computer and other people’s computers (even if they have a keylogger) without fearing of losing your funds.

Harvard (a reputable source) accurately describes [why being a first-mover is a disadvantage]( as history shows.

No need to be paranoiac. Not every person who believes BTC is irrelevant for quick and decentralized money transfers, is _for_ BCH.

Itʼs what Satoshi wrote last in the document linked in this thread.

It has to fix scaling (sharding and PoS) before getting a better score, methinks.

Why not? If Bitcoin Cash is really nothing but a simple fork of Bitcoin, what does prevent them from copying Lightning Network as well?

Turing-complete smart contracts.

Remember LN is meant to be _cross-blockchain_ – it’s actually one of the main points written [on their website](


When LN is out (and hopefully adopted _in full force_, meaning on several blockchains), Bitcoin is not necessarily meant to be the one used by consumers. Any alt can implement LN if they really want. [It could be Ethereum, it could be OmiseGo, it could be Stellar](

Just googled him up. That guy was a Bitcoin Core contributor – so he definitely had the skills for it.
@_date: 2018-01-10 19:01:52
~~Bitcoin (BTC) is traditionally called Bitcoin Core.~~ Apparently not, sorry for the bad information!
@_date: 2018-01-08 10:04:37
Yes it had. Paying in electronic information (bits) as if it was a currency (coin).

I’m an ETH maximalist and even *I* don’t think Bitcoin will _ever_ die. BTC will just adapt (Lightning, etc.).
@_date: 2017-12-16 17:15:01
On what basis are you 90% sure they’ll add it, and 10% sure they won’t?
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:22:41
Watch the ETH/BTC ratio. When it’s up (and goes firmly upwards), it’s a good time to trade your BTC for ETH. When ratio goes down (which has been the case for a long time), it’s better to have BTC than ETH because it rises faster.

IOTA is _not_ a blockchain, which means no ordered transactions. Keep IOTA where it belongs, which means possibly IoT.
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:50:24
Blockchain is old tech, really? �� Have you heard of side channels (Lightning Network on BTC, Raiden/Plasma on ETH)?
@_date: 2017-12-01 23:24:40
It's not ready now, but maybe it will be in 2020. You are quick to judge.

The problem with bigger block size isn’t disk space. It’s bandwidth.

[Parity Technologies]( the same people who wrote the [Parity Bitcoin client](
(I genuinely don’t know what you’re trying to imply. Who of importance works at Parity and how would that be bad for consensus?)

The weak hands. All the Mr. Smiths who went into crypto just to “get rich quick”. Theyʼll ride the current trend, and wonʼt believe the potential of a specific crypto like you guys do.
@_date: 2017-12-24 12:25:42
And the community decided to follow, by marking these nodes as valid. The only difference with Bitcoin is that people rallied over a public figure, which made the pill easier to swallow. Bitcoin is more decentralised and censorship-resistant for this reason, but saying Ethereum is centralised (especially nowadays) is just plain FUD.
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:59:34
I had never transferred anyone electronic money in less than a hour… before knowing Bitcoin. I wish I had seen the potential of BTC when it was still a bargain to buy.
Feel free to do a `RemindMe!` command to prove me wrong in the future. I would gladly, humbly accept you were right. (It would be fun to [make a trustless, provably-fair bet]( on it, but who uses smart contracts in real life anyway?)
Anyway, I’m not going to try much to convince anyone of the merits of a non-BTC currency on a BTC-related subreddit. is devoted to discussion about Bitcoin and its ecosystem. Feel free to make this remark outside of this subreddit!
@_date: 2017-12-26 00:23:05
Contrary to you guys, I donʼt believe in Bitcoin, but I have to agree Bitcoinʼs censorship resistance is incredible.
@_date: 2017-12-16 17:24:38
Speculative value and technological value aren’t the same thing. BTC has an amazingly good speculative value. People who want easy money would be foolish to ignore (or even hate) BTC.

I was only listing solutions directly related to Bitcoin to avoid being banned from this sub. Ethereum’s [Casper update]( has a 3 seconds block time.

The DAO hard fork wouldn't be possible today. With the amount of Parity nodes available (which isn't the official client, so rogue changes from the Ethereum Foundation couldn't be pushed to it), there wouldn't have enough consensus.

Lightning Network is cross-blockchain. Even shitcoins can implement it and interact with it.

I believe OP posted it here because it is an open-source project that anyone can run, for cheaper price if you want?
