You mean THIS Somalia??

Yeah, no shit. Right on que.  I'm wondering why these dopes think they can drive you from the home you own outright because you don't wish to be stolen from.

Disassociation and ostracization are powerful weapons especially when used against an entity who relies on public perception to exist and generate income (a company in a free market).

Hahahaha, wow. Wrong. Just, wrong. The mistake you make is in assuming that there wouldn't be courts or law without a state.  People HAVE thought of this before, so, no, you're not stumbling onto a "fresh idea". Reading probably isn't your thing, but here:
In short, reasonable people wouldn't form lynch mobs in response to a mere accusation (and if they did, they'd be found guilty of initiating aggression without cause), they'd want to hear the FACTS, and judge accordingly.  If the accused is found in the wrong, he'd be compelled to pay damages to the victim(s).  What would NOT happen is that we'd claim there's been an "offense against society" and kidnap the offender and force our neighbors at gunpoint to feed and clothe him, which is what happens now.

Actually placed my very first order today!  Had been a huge fan of the concept ever since I heard of it a couple years ago on AdamVSTHeMan. Such Agorist!! ;)

I expect this will change quite a bit in the coming couple years.  Has anyone watched any of the old news segments from the mid 90s where newscasters are confusingly asking things like "Does anyone know what the internet is? I think it's like computer mail, right?"

Yeah- unfortunately my bank issues Mastercard branded cards and not Visa.

Yeah. I know what you mean. That's the proposal that would require ID for every transaction?
Thanks a ton for the info.

Joe Rogan no longer allows anarcho-capitalists on his show after Stephan Molyneux.

This was the same crooked judge that heard the original case and it was assumed she would deny the request for retrial.  This had to be tried first first so that:

I looooathe this ubiquitous idea among big business that they "own" their customers. BTC cannot "steal customers" because customers arent property....and BTC isnt an entity!

Still a great big hole hundreds of miles around me in NYS :(
The closest one was in 3 hrs away in Burlington (without needing a passport) and the state of VT shut that one down recently.

Lol.  Hilarious coming from a person who I assume has used fiat currency and credit cards
