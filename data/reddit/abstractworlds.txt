Sure, just copy the Upper number on the blockchain into the accelorator Interface.
It depends when they mine the Next Block but give it a try

It means Balance or literally "you are in the goods" as in not taken a credit has nothing to do with profit.

I don't want to advise you doing anything there is a certain risk involved...
I bought some when it was already going up just Listen to your feeling and wether it is reasonable to think it will go up even further now.
I would buy a small amount (like 1/3 of your investment) and then wait a day or so because I don't think it will continue at this rate and maybe it even drops a bit); but I wish I could predict these things.

Last edit ^^ it only uses USB storage so after every reboot it is wiped clean. If it hasn't convinced you by now I don't know either.
Stay safe

Hey maybe check out Tails. As far as I remember they had a tumbling option at least some information implemented... I am currently not using it but have a look it is nice afterall.
Edit: maybe even their webpage states something about tumbling

I don't know sometimes my memory jams a bit. But I do remember they gave tips on how to tumbl with electrum in the tails interface... Maybe Check that out or rather ask in the DNmarkets subreddit they probably know Better and I don't know whether the mods like the direction of this Conversation.
Wish you luck
