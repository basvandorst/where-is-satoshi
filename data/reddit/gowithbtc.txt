Bitfinex does not have cold storage since last year. All funds are stored in individual user account/address.

I think the hacker pretend as withdrawals for each account in Bitfinex. But I still hope that these movements were done Bitfinex to rescue the funds.
@_date: 2016-08-02 20:35:31
All fund moving happened within 2-3 hours. The amount is huge. That's why I hope the movements were done by Bitfinex for fund rescue. Otherwise, hacker did them.....

Someone is still sending btc to old hot wallets: 114BTC
@_date: 2015-05-22 15:11:40
Someone keeps deposit coin this hot wallet until now.
Not sure Bitfinex will honor this guy's deposit.
@_date: 2015-05-22 14:32:21
it is not hard to find Bitfinex cold wallet.
Excess coins of hot wallets are always sent to intermediate wallet, and excess coins of intermediate wallet are sent to cold wallet. That's why those wallet could be identified. The way I used to identified Bitfinex hack address is to find the most recent hot wallets to intermediate wallet. Because of recent deposit activities of these hot wallets, it is likely they will get deposit again and then get stolen by hacker. It is a way to identify hack address.
If there is no coins are sent from hot wallets to intermediate wallet for over several hours. It means hot wallets are drained. This is a sign of hot wallets being compromised.

segwit just introduce new transaction format/type. We can still use the transaction type currently we are using. Thus, segwit does not fix all malleability problem

It is very easily that non-upgraded miners/nodes and upgraded miners/nodes to have chain split after activation starts if those non-upgraded miners want to spend 'anyone-can-spend' SW transactions.

Bitcoin is PoW, not Proof of nodes. It is so easily to create thousands full nodes with low costs.  I think most of users would prefer to stay in most of hash power chain.

Not overlapped with BU blocks. Votes for 8MB mainly comes from BW. BW has signaled 8MB over 1 year 
@_date: 2017-02-19 06:47:06
I don't think it is obvious for average people.
@_date: 2017-02-26 07:03:45
BU can't hardfork without majority of hash power, otherwise their chain will be destroyed by 1M block core chain as 1M block core chain is longest chain and valid to BU nodes.

Sorry, I made mistake, missing one number for both cold wallets, the correct calculation:
Total bitcoins of Bitfinex in Cold wallet(Found now): 115000+116849=231849BTC
Total bitcoins lost to today hack(up to now 12:22PM GMT): 1474BTC
Percentage of lost: 1474/231849 = 0.635%

Banks in Hong Kong refuse to open bank account for Bitcoin companies just because AML is becoming more and more strict in this place. Banks don't want to risk for small profit but more troublesome for supporting Bitcoin businesses.

* Your feedback was not confirmed becuase the btc amount traded was not larger than 0.5BTC.
* 99% of positive feedbacks is not good actually. You should check every negative/neutral feedbacks and recent positive feedback of the trader before openning a trade.
* You should report this issue to Localbitcoins by filing a fraud report. LBC will suspend that trader's account

Should provide an option tp seller to set purchase limit for newbie buyers. Buyer account accumulate more trade history and has perfect feedback score, the less possible for scam happens in this account. The reason is an account with trade history and perfect feedback score is very valuable. There is mamy market demands for LBC accounts in bitcointalk can prove this.
@_date: 2015-07-14 04:53:14
Better ask the buyer to buy BTC with Walmart gift cards. Go to a Walmart buy a physical gift card with CASH, and keep the cash receipt. Send the pics of card and cash receipt to seller for exchange.
Here is the bitcoin seller on LBC for Walmart gift card:
A big problem is the sellers don't want to trade with newbies accounts.

why there is no codes to do auto discover high speed peers and stick to them? I think most of client users are just average people. They rely on the node to do auto high speed peers for them.
