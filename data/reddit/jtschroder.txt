I'm pro core but this sounds like propaganda.

CNBC legitimizes BTC for retail investors.  Catch the interview with Mike Novogratz that aired today.  Mike is certainly as relevant as anyone in the space.  It was excellent PR compared to the Silk Road days a couple years ago.  They actually take BTC as a serious investment opportunity.

1.	Inclined or eager to fight; hostile or aggressive. 
2.	Of, pertaining to, or engaged in warfare.
One that is hostile or aggressive, especially one that is engaged in war.

Most people didn't know the meaning of the word "HODL" until recently.  Only the few and proud HODL'ed back in the day.

Miners will mine the most profitable chain.  Period.  They don't give two shits about BCH, BTC, or Segwit.

People who say money can't buy happiness are full of shit.  At the very least it can buy peace of mind.  I remember the days when I was literally throwing change together to pay rent and perhaps buy a slice of pizza for dinner.  I'm not rich, but I'm not destitute either.  Case in point - I'm  much happier not being butt-ass-broke; in large part, because I stumbled upon bitcoin before it took off.  Piece of advice - don't sell all of your BTC, just enough to get you out of hard times.  Best of luck brother in your future endeavors.

I'm thankful that I believed in something when very few did.  I listened, researched, and was mining.  It felt crazy at the time. Now, not so much.  And yes, the money is appreciated and has helped my family get out of debt and buy a home.

It could happen at any moment...  Once the whales start dumping expect a crash.  No worries though, it always rebounds to a higher price.  Buy the dip and HODL dude.
@_date: 2017-11-13 00:22:33
Bummer man.  Rest assured it'll dip again and again and again and then reach ATH.  Rinse and repeat.

Great response and funny as shit.

I came out of the bitcoin closet a few years ago and it was uncomfortable at best.  My father in law is a retired financial advisor and my friends are super conservative.  It was like I was trying to sell time shares or Amway...

I'm thankful for being lucky and for having the ability to listen and study back in 2012.  And yes, I'm excited b/c I felt like a whack job when I firs got into BTC.

The dude has destroyed every bit of credibility he once had in the community.  Now he seems to be doubling down on pure fuckery.

Benjamin Lawsky, the so-called architect of the BitLicense made it insanely difficult, complicated, and expensive to obtain.  Now the a-hole is a "digital currency consultant" who navigates companies through the difficult process of obtaining said license.

Massive BCH dumps headed this way.  By the time Coinbase releases BCH that sh*t could be close to worthless.

It's a get rich slow scheme.
@_date: 2017-10-05 16:48:13
It's impossible for me to take a dump and not check the price of bitcoin.

Where's your source?
@_date: 2017-10-29 20:28:42
No, the press would eat it up and we'd see a temporary spike.  In the long run, yes, having one of the world's largest companies embracing BTC would certainly influence others to adopt it as well.

I always HODL but ALWAYS give a fuck about what's happening with Core, the miners, the FUD, Ver, Jihan, etc...  It must be nice to be a "real" HODLer and not give a fuck.  Teach me Obi Wan.

It was nice to see about 70 percent of the show dedicated to BTC and blockchain technology.  Basic stuff but still good to get into the minds of future investors.  Positive PR for bitcoin amid all the drama and negativity in the community.
@_date: 2017-05-10 12:31:49
No. Price increases never get old.  Never.  Ever.

It will certainly tank if/when the network hard forks.  And it will inevitably go back up again.  Hang on folks, it's going to be one helluva ride.

I just can't see 95% of miners agreeing to signal SegWit.  I can't see 95% of miners agreeing on anything.
