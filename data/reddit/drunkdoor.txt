Not that I agree, but you're slightly missing the point.
The idea is that if these coins were forever colored, people might slowly stop accepting those coins. If you washed them at the bitcoin casino, the casino is now stuck with them. In that reality the bitcoin casino might also not want to accept them because they realize the fungibility of those specific coins is lower than other coins.
There's an interesting parallel with people paying more to buy block rewards because those are brand new coins.
@_date: 2016-04-12 22:04:50
The daily supply is decreasing from ~3600 =&gt; ~1800 new coins. We can't say much else about what that means with certainty. For everyone who is SURE the price will go up, there is another side which could say that they are SURE security will go down. If price stays the same with a reduced supply, miners will shut off (at least the ones which are losing money).

Probably bigger, though it's tough to say. Alibaba itself doesn't sell products but the marketplace facilitated more in sales than amazon and ebay combined last year. My only concern is what Alibaba accepting bitcoin means. The most promising scenario is that they would give a discount at purchase time to bitcoin users and they would give merchants the option to convert to fiat immediately, or to accept bitcoin straight up. Even in that best case scenario I see a lot of initial sell pressure being added to bitcoin.

Human emotions are one thing, rational justification is another. Even still we can pretend it's the same for the sake of conversation. Bitcoin would be better off without either of those types, but alas that won't ever happen, and moreover the market is controlled by them. So your attitude in this is if you can't beat 'em, join 'em. I understand that and can't fault that at it's fundamental level. I can encourage a new fundamental of caring about the future of our world. When I lay on my deathbed I hope that I can feel good about the things I've done for the world and I base my decisions on that hope. Of course I'm trying to take a moral high ground here which in most cases is complete bullshit, but not if the alternatives are very similar. For example littering is easy, but throwing things into a trash isn't that much harder. Once you've decided to stop littering, how mad does it make you when you see litter laying around? I think everyone would choose what is best for everyone at a small sacrifice to themselves. Many people will be bitter unless everyone makes the same decision. Change doesn't happen over night, but you, as a miner are in a position to help. I would encourage you to make the small sacrifice and move to a different pool. Then start asking others to do the same.

I disagree that there has been no driving force. Very large merchants are adopting daily and the entire ecosystem is moving toward a lower barrier to entry and ease of use. That said, I think the auction is driving the price down more than anything. Ive picked up a coin at 550 to put my money where my mouth is. 
The problem I have with your opinion is that you are completely willing to admit you are contributing to the destruction of Bitcoin and have no remorse. For you it is all about the money.

I'm talking about gold. And yes, if the universe is infinite, then the amount of gold is infinite. 
Are you aware of how gold is created? Neutron stars smashing into each other. IF you're going to say that neutron stars are not infinite, go for it. You can make that argument...
@_date: 2015-07-16 23:01:54
@_date: 2019-04-22 18:41:57
The universe isn't finite as far as we can tell, either. Many cosmologists believe in an infinite universe. 
Besides that point, you're being pedantic. The amount of gold out there can be considered infinite for all practical purposes.
@_date: 2019-04-22 17:32:24
1. If the universe is infinite, then gold is infinite.
@_date: 2019-04-22 19:40:41
I actually refuted someone else claiming it was finite, so basically what you're saying is that it's not provable either way. Fine I'm happy with that. I also said that it's infinite for all intents and purposes. There's entire asteroids made of gold, and one neutron star explosion can produce 10x the mass of earth in gold. The argument about gold being "finite" in any sense is laughable. Stop being a pedant.
@_date: 2015-07-12 16:30:02

It's hard to say but not impossible to give an estimate.
There are ~220k unique addresses right now. Of course many of those are exchanges.
There are ~78M transactions in Bitcoin history. Of course many of those have multiple outputs.
It's extremely likely that under 100M total people use bitcoin. There's no way to know, but I'd say actual figure is probably closer to 10M. I think it's a fair estimate, and probably an overestimate, to say that 7B/10M=0.14% of the population owns bitcoin. A far cry from 16.0%

Haha... Hey I'm in this thing too, I'll take it. He was being a bit too grandiose for me.

Perhaps eventually more businesses will accept the gas station model where plastic pays a higher rate. If there were a bitcoin alternative it would be the same as cash (plus txn fee). Maybe it could even be cheaper than cash since businesses would avoid having to waste the extra man hours involved with handling cash.

It is true that many household devices are becoming "smart" devices.   As long as they have some OTHER reason to have a internet connection this makes sense. I sort of want to write a trojan that will point these devices to a new address bwahahah.

I realize that's what you were trying to say. You have bad puns and you don't know the definition of woosh. Have a great day!

Somebody down voted you and so i want to know what the better solution is. I simply don't have a high level enough view of all this to say if you are right or wrong.

No disrespect intended, but a question. Why are you scouring through this sub with such a pessimistic view of the currency? 
@_date: 2015-02-08 08:17:27
Although I'm into btc, why does it matter which decentralized currency system wins (as long as it is truly decentralized) ?

Ah yes. We are BOTH humans after all. It's almost impossible to discern based upon those three terms what side of the argument you fall on, however, I will assume that you believe they (edit: bitcoin and gold) are different for brevity's sake. Would you describe to me what is illogical about that belief?

Teach me your ways, sir or madaam.
edit: Let me guess, buy low, sell high?? But are you buying or selling right now?

Agree-ish - Bitcoin is a special set of 0's and 1's that makes them "shiny"
Disagree - as bitcoin becomes more widely accepted this point will be destroyed. Even now you can trade goods for bitcoins and bitcoins for goods. Mastercoin has ideas about how to create a market that allows shorts.
Disagree-ish - the underlying force behind both is USD. You can argue that isn't the future or the promise of bitcoin, but it is today's reality.
WOW. Find me that chart, I would seriously find that fascinating! :) I quite generally live by the principle that the last thing that happens is the most likely thing that will happen next. As time goes on we can incorporate patterns at statistics into those observations for accuracy. I personally think it is significant to find correlations in nature be it human or fungal.

For some reason I always saw alligators which I suppose are a lot more like dragons than a dragon would care to admit. The dragon would point out the lack of wings first and foremost and would hope that the argument might stop there. Only an astute observer might notice that wings are not entirely necessary for alligator that just so happens to be in the clouds as that would get them no further up. Perhaps wings could push them along or even prevent others from getting too close but they'd ultimately be less than important.
Might I ask what makes you believe that a cloud is a dragon and not an alligator?

X axis - check. Y axis - check. 
In all seriousness, if you're right, playing stocks would seem to be a pretty simple formula.

Wow. I'm so poor at trading. I have lost money and lost bitcoin trying to capitalize on the free fall. Now i'm going to make my worst decision of all and hold onto what i have left while it continues to fall.
