maybe the whole point was making a lot of fiat money, not holding it forever... :)

reddit is now 4chan?

Happy new year
@_date: 2018-01-18 08:57:08
you could therefore cry
@_date: 2018-01-11 07:44:50
I thought it was a currency?
@_date: 2018-01-16 05:12:02
Why should it? The futures are cash settled
@_date: 2018-01-18 08:05:44
Reality is evil...
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:57:59
at least cash settled futures
@_date: 2017-12-29 06:57:50
imho never, bitcoin is death

i think its better to take a small loss and take my cance again, then hoping that big loss will go away
@_date: 2017-12-27 17:27:59
sounds a bit paranoid
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:47:41
never had any coins, just enjoying the show :)
@_date: 2017-12-30 08:25:35
and "i dont read it because i dont like it" is an argument?
@_date: 2017-12-27 15:20:15
I agree with you.
@_date: 2017-12-29 07:02:57
perhaps, better cashing out before its to late
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:53:47
Its Christmas and i am a nice guy... ;)
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:40:04
The big Money dont play with bitcoins, look at the Volume
@_date: 2017-12-27 21:04:59
rising means the price goes up, look at the chart... :)
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:03:40


then the crash would have some good


here i disagree, you could see this coming, marketcap (inkl altcoins) was moving sideways since a few days, unconfirmed tx was rising and 20000 was a very strong psychological level
@_date: 2017-12-30 16:29:12
cut your loss
@_date: 2017-12-30 08:05:01
ignorance is bliss
@_date: 2017-12-29 08:54:45
patience, soon
@_date: 2017-12-24 15:45:09
bla bla ... everything is fine ... bla bla
@_date: 2018-02-02 04:58:25
1$? You are such an optimist.
@_date: 2018-02-07 14:42:06
do we talk about a currency or a religion?
@_date: 2018-02-07 15:29:27
the value of bitcoin in fiat is pure faith
@_date: 2018-02-05 13:52:55
