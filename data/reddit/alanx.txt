"or include" should have been to relay.  I didn't mean to imply editing powers on blocks.  Nothing requires a full node to relay what they view as invalid transactions.


At the point that you are submitting a transaction, the full node can simply not forward your message.  You will not as a full node burn any interesting power or diskspace tossing a request you don't like.


Merged mining adds data to blocks Full Nodes have to download and process.  How can you say it doesn't matter what Full Nodes think if they don't want to support Namecoin, for example?  You force Full Nodes to support Namecoin anyway, if you include their hash.  Just like when miners putting OP_RETURNS into blocks that force them to support those entries as well.
In the end, the OP_RETURN user just makes a request.  It is the miners that put the thing in the blocks and force the Full Nodes to download them...
We are a very abusive community, it seems.

In the original paper by Satoshi Nakimoto, Bitcoin is the payment system, and bitcoin (lowercase) is the token.  Using any payment service utilizes the payment system, so yeah.  They are accepting Bitcoin.  To the extent that they can get suppliers to accept Bitcoin, they can greatly lower transaction costs by slowly taking up the use of bitcoin, the token, which had far lower transaction costs than even using lower cost payment services.

Inflationary by design is proving to be a problem for money in general too. It lowers the cost of labor, sure, which increases employment.  But now we are seeing that it also concentrates wealth (i.e. it lowers the cost of labor).
So the libertarians were wrong, constant inflation doesn't turn into hyper inflation so much. Instead it impoverishes everyone relying on a wage.  Even doctors and other professionals.  When I went to school in the 70's, my dad (a doctor) easily paid for my college out of his normal budget.  Now a doctor hasn't a chance to so easily pay for college.
Now some might claim that education has risen in cost faster then everything else.  Well DUH!  Because the cost to produce everything else benefits from technology, automation, etc.  But kids still take 12 years to get through high school, 4 years for college, and teachers still teach pretty much the same number of students, who take up the same space and real estate in schools.
So in fact, the damage to the value of money has been higher than CPI suggests, and in an economy with the highest productivity in history, the work force has a harder time making ends meet.
Just had to point this out.  I have other issues with your observations, but praise of inflation is one of my hot buttons.  And I am no libertarian.

I think you should include something about the ability to separate the ability to spend from the ability to audit.
Cryptocurrency technology allows for cryptographic proof of audits, reserves, process, and more.
In other words, applying Bitcoin technology to banks enforces honesty.  Eliminates the need to trust the auditors.  Allows for open audits without risk of theft from the accounts by the auditors themselves.  That means you can open the books for public inspection, and you don't have to trust artifacts that may or may not reflect reality.
That is the innovation that will fundamentally remake finance:  Honesty through transparency via proof of audit.

Maybe so, maybe not.  
Colored coins are just a protocol on top of Bitcoin, and really no different than Mastercoin (thus I am not sure ChromaWallet is a counter example).
Bitcoin only solutions simply cannot implement things like selling shares of stock for example.  For that, you need Colored coins, Mastercoin, or an altcoin with extended features like Ethereum.  But Daniel doesn't like the lack of security inherent in an altcoin like Ethereum, leaving one looking for a solution like Mastercoin or Colored coins.  He admits to some value in something like Namecoin, but of course that isn't needed if you use Mastercoin or Colored coin on top of Bitcoin.
Mastercoin will argue that Colored Coins lack a funding mechanism for the support and continued development.  Colored Coin developers will argue that Mastercoin is too ... corporate?  controlled?
Working with both groups, I am not sure who will win.  But neither are altcoins, in my opinion, per Daniel's arguments.
**edit, and full disclosure:** I'm actually involved with all three to a small extent.  I wrote a FAQ for colored coins, consulted on script design for Ethereum, and looking to build a Mastercoin based project in the coming months.

Well, you are defining "antisocial" as taking an action you don't agree with, yet it is the action requested by the submitter.  
I'd tend to define "antisocial" as being uncooperative and judgmental and rejecting the request of the submitter because they are outside of, and don't share the values of the miner and those that agree with the miner.  
But these are just words, not objective, unbiased conclusions either way.  Your language is simply confusing, nothing more.


Yeah, but I can catch up when a block does include the OP_RETURN transactions.  the Merged mining has a more complex catch up strategy.


Well I do agree that we don't need to hope all its hashes are included, but rather we have to ensure that all the hashes are included, one way or another.  The architecture of Factom requires all Entries and All Entry Chains to each have a Merkle tree based proof off of Bitcoin.  Because we don't want Factom users to have to rely on Factom for proofs.


Well, obviously I don't really want multiple hashes recorded in a block, but rather my Merkle roots.  That makes for easier proofs.  But clearly I could change that.
**But let's make a statement here**
I think I will give the merged mining approach renewed consideration.  It still looks like something that will take time to gain a commitment from miners significant enough that I can use that approach.  But perhaps long term it would be better, and if Factom gains some success it may have ability to incentivize the miners to do so.

Of course, so is your analysis... 
The current banking system has an economy of scale advantage.  Bitcoin's cost of operation is almost completely independent of transaction volume, i.e. 1 transaction per block costs just as much to process as a full block of transactions.
The Bitcoin transaction volume limit of 7 transactions per second is a block size limitation, not a technology limitation.  


Picking up on some bias here.  This year I have made on two occasions huge payments for services in Bitcoin.  I *think* those transactions might have been real...
Actually, the banking and financial sector takes up 8 percent to 30 percent of the GDP (depending upon how you measure it. Mostly how much of Mortgages do you assign to the financial sector vs real estate).  The overhead is quite difficult to underestimate, and that overhead can also be viewed in terms of energy.  Because it drives up the cost to do everything (and thus the energy expended to do everything).

I like it when bankers get to loan money out for interest that they print for free, and that is fair.  
How does anyone pay interest on that money?  Right, they borrow... And incur more interest on that money too.
And when that money is printed, it lowers the value of my money, my wages, my pensions, my 401k.... It when increases my taxes, where a gain in value might be a loss in real value, but due to inflation, it is numerically a gain....
How is any of this fair?
A steady diet of inflation for 40 years has produced the greatest income gap since the 20's.  It is likely worse.  It would seem if you give the rich and powerful Free money, and they loan it out at interest to the rest of us, we become poor.

Adjust for CPI.  CPI sucks as a measure of monetary inflation, but you can still use it for this experiment.
Note CPI assumes it makes sense to average prices to get a change in prices, despite the fact that technology and productivity increases do not effect all sectors the same.
Monetary Inflation (price changes solely due to monetary policy) effects all sectors equally.  Everyone is paid the same dollars, and uses the same dollars to buy all goods and services.  The pressure then on prices due to monetary policy is the same for all goods and services.  What varies are other factors, technology, seasons, culture, resource scarcity, etc.  
To me it is interesting that nobody looks at how to isolate monetary policy effects on the economy from these other pressures.

The architecture of Factom will allow us to record an entry at a cost of 1/10 to 1/100 of what it costs to record a bitcoin transaction.  If you need a ton of transactions, and you need to interact with many parties, Factom is going to make sense.
I do think that some companies will run their own Factom servers, and maybe back them by writing entries into Factom instead of Bitcoin (because it is cheaper).  But we believe the network effect, low costs, distributed architecture, etc. will drive applications to Factom.
But yes, you don't *need* to pay someone for something you could write yourself.  Proof of Publishing (by just writing a hash to the blockchain) is cheap and easy.  But creating an auditable, uniquely identified, timestamped list of entries isn't as easy.  Now your "very quickly" becomes significantly more expensive and complicated.

So, you have no source.
Comparing Banking to Bitcoin is a complex and difficult task, because they are fundamentally different approaches to money.  Bitcoin is very new, and your simplistic dismissal isn't quite the evidence of my ignorance that you imply.  You have quite a bit more work to do a proper comparison of banking to Bitcoin than to glibly quote "5% for transaction processing" without going deeper.
For example, I will give you lending as a significant activity of banks.  Can you really dismiss lending as a bank function with nothing to do with the block chain?
Of course lending is about making money available to the economy. But what this means is that lending is how we grow the money supply via fractional reserve banking (of course, that is sans any reserve held by the banks). Yet this is actually one of functions of the block chain.  Instead of growing the money supply via loans to be paid back plus interest, Bitcoin pays those processing transactions and securing the network with new Bitcoin. 
So with banks, money is created by banks and lent with interest to their customers.  With Bitcoin, money is created in return for services rendered to the Bitcoin system.
The economy of Bitcoin is found in replacing a Federal Reserve, FDIC, and bank lending structure with the distribution of money based on services rendered.  The contention that Bitcoin is more expensive in terms of energy is a difficult one to justify long term with advances in technology (producing more energy efficient solutions for computing all the time) as contrasted with Banking, which really hasn't progressed much at all, particularly not in the US.

Cryptographic proof of reserves allows for off blockchain transactions while providing full proof of reserves.  You can't do that with gold or dollars.
People will be sensitive to proof of reserves after Mt.Gox melted down.  Fractional reserve banking with assets that cannot be arbitrarily produced as needed by the banking system has always resulted in bank runs and bank failures.




Not in today's world.  You can't directly spend gold OR dollars on the Internet, or really even in person for large amounts.  But you can Bitcoin.


FRB has always been dangerous.  But until you had a way to publicly audit (i.e. not trust the auditors kind of audit), you couldn't stop banks from over extending themselves.
Even 2008 demonstrated the dangers of FRB today.


You can audit and institution and cryptographically prove the audit with Bitcoin.  And while there are limitations (such as hiding assets or liabilities), such fraud leaves a permanent record.  Systems providing cryptographic proof of process could make even hiding assets and liabilities very difficult to do.
All of this is based on Bitcoin.  You might not think it is interesting, but tons of investors and technology folks seem to think otherwise.

Bitcoin is honesty.
Bitcoin provides verification of payment, real time audits. Bitcoin eliminates "bad checks" and counterfeiting. Thefts can be tracked. Large organizations can be audited even without their permission (note the 200,000 bitcoin of Mt Gox detected by blockchain analysis).
Honesty thus imposed on the financial system would be totally subversive.

Of course, this kind of "Bitcoin == Napster" logic is so incredibly shallow.
So many centralized monetary systems that challenged the dollar have been taken down (The Liberty Dollar, e-Gold, and many others).  Those were Napster (a centralized system).
What replaced Napster wasn't ITunes.  It was Bittorrent.  Decentralized sharing.
Bitcoin is decentralized.  It can't be taken down.  And oh-by-the-way, Napster might still be dominate if it *wasn't taken down because it could be*.  
iTunes exists because the government says its okay.  But Bittorrent exists because nobody can make it go away.

The decimation of wages through manipulation of the value of currencies world wide by central banks represents theft at such an epic scale as to defy the imagination!
The Financial industry destroyed Trillions of Dollars of value in 2008.  The LIBOR scandal involved price fixing of 500 trillion dollars of currency trades.  The Credit Default Swap price fixing scandal (impacting the cost of credit) involved 300 trillion dollars of instruments.
All of that, and almost nobody is investigated, convicted, and jailed.  The 2.3 billion dollar fine levied represents 0.00046 percent fine (relative to the amount of trades that were manipulated).
Regulation without realistic fines, without people going to jail, without restraining fraud and price manipulation.... It isn't regulation.
It is window dressing.
At least in Bitcoin, businesses are allowed to fail, drug dealers are jailed, and money laundering is instigated and actions taken.
My take away from all of this? 
Bitcoin is way more regulated than the legacy financial system.

The only reason you don't see the relevance is that you really don't care about the Factom protocol.  If I create a stream of Merkle Roots to be recorded in the blockchain, and some are missing, then I can't create a proof.  Not directly.
 If I include the Merkle roots in following Merkle roots, then on the math side, I still have a path even if some of my hashes are missing.  Then my code has to track what got included and what didn't.   While it is all tracking that can be done, it remains much more complicated than having simple transactions in the blockchain that I look up and validate against.  
In the case of OP_RETURN, I gather up all of them, disregard unrelated values, sort them, and I am good to go.  My code isn't unduly complicated just because some hashes get delayed or recorded out of order.

Our meetup regularly brings in people that have not figured it all out.  And I have no problem sitting down and working it through with them.
Yeah, I get short sometimes with people that go on about how credit cards have already solved the payment problem, and there isn't anything new about Bitcoin.  But that's on me.

I went to the Food Bank a few days ago and talked to them about their decision to accept Bitcoin (and of course, encourage them to be involved in the [Texas Bitcoin Conference](  And they will be! Yea!).
They are hugely excited.  Bitcoin dramatically cuts their processing costs for donations.  Credit cards, checks, and even cash extract significant fees and administration overhead to process.
That is one thing people neglect in understanding the costs of the legacy financial system.  The fees they charge are only part of the overhead.  Companies have to hire people full time to manage the processing of money.  This is "Administrative Overhead".
Bitcoin cuts not only transaction fees, but it hugely simplifies the administration of donations.  For example, with Credit Cards the food bank had to up the minimum donation to $5.  Because people were using them to test the validity of a stolen credit card, and being a charity, credit cards are loath to block such a payment.
Safe and secure transactions means any payment is something you can accept without fear of putting your customers at risk.  You don't every handle information that could compromise the security of a customer.

Bitcoin is the first DAC.    
Mesh Networks have great promise.  We have never had any tech that would allow someone to make money in a friction-less fashion by setting up a hot spot, running a microwave transmission channel, giving access to a fiber network, and setting up a device to act as a repeater.
A successful Mesh Network could quickly evolve into a telecommunications network, providing real competition to AT&amp;T, Verizon, and friends.  There are HUGE market pressures that might flow in that direction should some success with Mesh Networks be realized.
TOR networks provide little incentive to provide access nodes, limiting their security.  Cryptocurrency could change this in the next couple of years.
The SAFE Network (Maidsafe) allows people to provide storage and earn tokens.  A distributed autonomous cloud could be faster, more secure, and more reliable than data centers.
Micro payments enabled by cryptocurrencies could lead to entertainment distribution systems constructed as DACs that compete with Steam, Amazon, eBay, etc.
All of these are very likely within the next 5 years.

No.  You only sync what you use.  If you use both Bitcoin *and* a sidechain, then yes.

Or the other way around.
The idea is to limit what people have to have on their systems to make transactions, kinda like Visa doesn't need MasterCard's data.
Factom by the way does this too, on a finer grain level for general data.   Applications build their own chains in Factom, but other applications don't have to have those chains.  Even other users of the same application don't need the chains of other users unless there are interactions...

True enough.  Though you may have trouble with proving you are only running one datastore, and perhaps have issues with interactions with multiple parties.  After all, nothing you do on a blockchain is unique to blockchain technology.  You can do everything with a centralized system, and you can lock down such a system with public publishing of a hash (in the New York Times if you don't have a blockchain).


We are talking about proof of process rather than just existence.  Existence is easy, but reconciliation across multiple systems of record, at least in this case, completely failed.

The barrier to entry for Bitcoin is access to a computer.
The barrier to entry for the Banking system is often being the right color, with an acceptable job, no criminal record (also related to race), and being born into the right family, i.e. being already in the banking world.
About [1/3 of the population in the US is unbanked or underbanked](  And yes, Bitcoin lowers the bar for entry into the financial system.
On a side note.  Those "All Important" Credit Scores?  Where is any research that Credit Scores actually measure risk?  That they are truly color and gender neutral?

I don't think I have a misconception (and certainly not a severe one) about how this all works.  Though I will admit to being less than an expert on some of these structures.  I haven't written any code to manipulate them.  
I do see the fact that storing a few fields in the block is a constant overhead vs OP_RETURN being unbounded (i.e. overhead with each use).  That said, constant overhead remains overhead.
Suppose that Factom succeeds, and nearly everyone currently putting data into the blockchain chose to use Factom rather than OP_RETURN and multi-sig, effectively making Factom the only OP_RETURN user.  Then the real overhead of Factom would be pretty darn small.   And with that kind of success, it would be pretty easy to get the miners on board, but it doing so wouldn't be all that significant in reducing bloat, as Factom would have already consolidated most of the bloat already.

The entire defense of the country depends upon cryptography.  Trusted computing and other tech can secure Bitcoin, and there are companies seeing up insurance.  Bitcoin CAN be secure.  The current financial system can not be secure.

Distributed consensus systems that do not involve Bitcoin value (i.e. colored coins, Mastercoin, Counterparty, etc.) could run on Factom, as long as Factom itself can be secured, i.e. reliably order entries, and place hashes where forking the ledger isn't possible, i.e. in Bitcoin.
Sidechains is something all together different, and has much harder problems to solve than simple consensus.  And two way pegging is a completely different problem space than creating a general purpose data layer (what Factom intends to do).
Consensus systems without pegging are secured by cryptography, not the recording system, be it Factom or Bitcoin.  To spend a colored coin/Mastercoin/Counterparty value, you have to have a proper signature, and just being the recording system doesn't give you the ability to sign those transactions.

You are giving too much value to low volume, low low low market penetration values. 2010- 2012 should not carry the same weight as 2013.
Here is a log graph of the [USD volumes](
I BTW am not thinking that the market will go "completely bananas".  I am expecting it to follow a year's worth of data, and am largely discounting the 3 years (for which we have data) prior.  This is not an argument about more than exponential growth.  This is an argument about the rate of said exponential growth, or the slope of the line in the graph.
I don't think Mt. Gox as pragmatically the only Exchange gave us good numbers on the value of Bitcoin.  2013 gave us better numbers, but still we do not have enough market penetration for good predictions.
Here is the [graph of with year trends drawn](  Note that his line makes no sense for any of the three Years for which we have data.  Especially 2010 - 2012.  
It might make some sense in 2014, if it is really reasonable to disregard the January runup into April.
bottom line is that we are just guessing.  But my guess is based on the fact that my 80 year old aunt had me buy her 1.25 Bitcoins today.  That a road of Food Trucks in Austin is talking about accepting Bitcoin as a group.  And two Dentists in North Austin are signing up this week and next week.
More people == more adoption == higher prices for BTC == Steady rate of growth, investment, and speculation.
And just like your graph shows, the dips are becoming statistically less interesting.  In a world market we increasingly see people buying into the dips. That is raising the floor.

Enron, WorldCom, Savings and Loan failures, 2008 financial collapse, mortgage foreclosure scandals, HSBC, LIBOR, Credit Default Swap price setting scandal, and 495 bank failures in the US since 2008... All massive failures, all propagated by the abuse of trust by centralized financial institutions.  
You do realize that a centralized entity CAN control your money on its own systems and STILL use a blockchain to insure all the benefits of validation and audit trails.
A centralized entity can be transparent.  But the loss of privacy in financial institutions (not their customers, the institutions) will be greatly resisted.


Funny that you can excuse the current financial system for losing a plane full of cash, but you can't excuse exchanges for using the same approach to implement trades as every other financial system in existence.
Besides, there are those designing the same kinds of cryptographically secured transactions within centralized servers as are provided by the blockchain.  Open Transactions is the main one, but others are surely working on the same.  And the point of the Kraken audit was to take a step towards a cryptographically validated audit.  And that is something the main finanical system hasn't done yet.
Bitcoin isn't yet what it will be.  Reforms that are possible with Bitcoin are not possible just using regulation and audits.  It is those "Obvious Benefits" that are not fully realized yet.

The right technology can be hugely more effective than regulations.  For example, good sanitation saves more lives than antibiotics.  And overuse of antibiotics is associated with a rise in autoimmune disorders....
The problem with Mt. Gox was security and a lack of transparency.  The opportunities that Bitcoin provides for real time, cryptographic audits should play the largest role in preventing these failures. And once we work out the kinks, the techniques should be applied to traditional banks.
And maybe some regulation to force real time cryptographic audits on banks and Bitcoin exchanges....

You do realize that MOST of government isn't actually tied to the banks and the financial institutions?  
Are you really that loyal to your bank?  To the company that holds your Mortgage? Why would anyone in any governmental role without any significant investment in banks and finance care about issues pertaining to banks?  They only make up about 8 percent of the GDP.  There are plenty of donations to be had from the rest of the economy, assuming Bitcoin really takes off.
Why do you think most of the departments and politicians and law enforcement would care if the banks and credit cards got some competition, particularly with a technology that separates the ability to spend completely from the ability to audit?  If I were them, I'd be demanding banks and financial institutions become more transparent using cryptographic techniques to allow real time auditing...
Cryptographic proof of reserves? Real time audit of financial transactions?  
This stuff might look terrible to banks, but it won't look terrible to much of government.

Actually, I didn't.  The discussion was longer than fits in an article for a paper.
Credit cards implement charge backs to cover a flaw, that massive security is required because any leak can result in a theft of the card. Some rate of fraudulent charges go undetected, and all of us pay for the overhead of paying back charges that are detected.
Bitcoin does not have this flaw.  Theft is still possible (any commodity can be stolen).  But Bitcoin cannot stolen just because someone observed a valid transaction.  
Bitcoin cannot be counterfeited, as every transaction is validated against a public ledger.
The discussion shouldn't be about the danger of using Bitcoin.  It should be about how credit cards, which had been with us for 50 years, fail to match the transactional security of a five year old open source program.
And what is their plan to implement these same security advantages?

Bitcoin is a payment system, and bitcoin (lowercase) is the token exchanged.  This is explained in Satoshi's paper.  
Dollars, yen, and gold have no payment system as part of the currency.  Thus payment systems are built upon banks and other financial institutions.  And while Bitcoin can be used easily by banks, a customer with a Bitcoin account will not be restricted to using banks, payment processors, and other financial institutions to conduct transactions.  In fact, they don't even need to keep their funds in a bank to secure them.
Thus a bank will have to provide actual compelling services to hold the Bitcoin customer, unlike the captive customers they have with conventional currencies.




You have to go back 100 years or more for any numbers with a deflationary currency.  And the Long Depression 1873-1879 has a period of steady dropping of prices, yet the real national product grew 6.8 percent per year, and you had 4.5 percent growth in real product per capita.  The idea that deflationary currencies prevent growth is a myth. 
What isn't a myth is that a steady environment of inflation lowers wages since wages are sticky, and the money illusion makes people accept lower wages than they would accept if someone actually dropped the dollar amount on their paychecks.  Solid Keynesian Economics here.






BTW, I am no libertarian, and I don't hold strictly to Austrian economics.  I am an engineer, and I hold to data.
In the 1800's, the financial sector at accounted for about 2 percent of the GDP.  Today the financial sector accounts for  8 percent or more of GDP.  Keep in mind that this means that, adjusting for all the advances and growth of all other sectors, the financial system is still 4 times greater *as a share of GDP*.   
If our current banking system made our economy more productive, then their share of GDP (which after all, doesn't actually produce a end user product or service) would go *down*, not *up*.
And I do appreciate you quoting Reddit's CEO, but that is hardly an authority on Bitcoin as a technology.  I think NewEgg and Expedia accepting Bitcoin throws a different light on where Bitcoin is going.

Claiming that writing code to be the only issue is like me claiming your failure to live in [Dime Box Texas]( is the only issue.  I can make the claim, but if I don't back that up with more than a simple claim, the statement is nothing more than a claim.
With Factom I need to do more than simply record the hash (as you know).  I also have to insure that the correct hashes recorded are identifiable (as you know).  Further, I have to communicate them to miners if they are going to record them (as you know).  And I cannot assume all miners will also run all the software behind Factom (as you know).  
The problem with miners including the hash is that there is little way to validate the communication of that hash to arbitrary miners.  While Factom can identify what public keys must sign a transaction for the hash to be valid via OP_RETURN, I don't see how I can expect to do the same with mining.
And other than claiming that I can, you don't really address any of the issues that would clearly get in the way of using miners.  You just say there is no issue.
And if miners block Factom, then I think they are voting for these kinds of solutions where people just write what they want directly into the blockchain.  You can't possibly block them all, because there will not be any kind of uniting pattern between them.  So it would seem to me that if you can see how I can actually use miners reliably, then we should talk about it.  If there isn't a realistic way to use miners, then we should figure out some way that works well.

I actually don't think that they will attack Factom.  But who knows?  It is quite a bit like Bitcoin, distributed with no centralized point of attack.
But on the government side, requiring immutable audit trails to be maintained makes regulation whales easier to enforce.  In fact, it might even make some regulation of banking and finance actually enforceable and prosecutable. 


It would clearly be retrievable after the attack, as long as enough nodes survive.  I think the service could continue even while under attack as long as enough nodes can remain on air.
I think some of the primary uses though would preclude an outright attack, at least in the Western World.  It is hard to make the claim that being immutable is against the law.

Right. Because there is no way to get the Bitcoin back once delivered, there is no possible market for a dollars to BTC service.  This is due to the universal law that shows no product can be sold to anyone unless the seller has some good means of reacquiring said product for non-payment.  We all know this is true.
Oh wait!  Goods that cannot be recovered once sold are sold all the time in the market!  Of course there are the difficult to reacquire goods like gold, silver, jewelry. Once the buyer has them in their hands, the buyer can run away. Oh, and how about food.  Almost always we charge AFTER the meal, and once served it cannot be reacquired.

On the other side, Bitcoin provides a mechanism to allow public, cryptographic audits.... You don't have to trust an auditor (see Enron, Worldcom, Savings and Loan crash,2007-2008 meltdown and many, many other examples for a failures of auditors).
Instead, you can use Bitcoin to give a solid audit to prove that a company has been behaving.  And that they are behaving *right now*, i.e. real time, automated audits!
495 failed banks in the US since 2008... this shows that banking, even after thousands of years, is subject to failure!  Regulation doesn't prevent failures!
What prevents failures is deploying technology that enforces honesty.  
For money, Bitcoin is the honesty we need.  So the solution to a situation where you have 495 failures in banking and 1 failure in Bitcoin is to deploy the technology we know we have to secure Bitcoin institutions, and to restructure the accounting of banks to provide the same transparency and certainty.

I think you have your tense wrong.  You may have meant "will be"
Let's consider the history of Bitcoin so far.  And while past performance is no promise of future gain, the past does inform us about how pressures upon Bitcoin's price have forced up the value of Bitcoin.  Bitcoin's historical Jan 1 price:
* Jan 1, 2011 ~ $0.30 (mtgox) 17x over 2011
* Jan 1, 2012 ~$5.10  (mtgox) 2.6x over 2012
* Jan 1, 2013 ~13.34  (mtgox) 55.9x over 2013
* Jan 1, 2014 ~745.45 (bitstamp) ??? over 2014
At the low end, one might see a 2.6x rise to ~$2000.  Or a high end rise of 55x to ~$40,000.  Since technology adoption tends to follow an [S-Curve as the technology difuses into the economy]( I would expect the results to be more towards the high end than the low end.
We are clearly still in the "innovators" stage.  But the value of Bitcoin is driven by Metcalfe's law, which states that ["the value of a telecommunications network is proportional to the square of the number of connected users of the system (n2)."](  As pointed out by this Ivan Raszl, [Bitcoin's price tracks the active addresses as predicted by Metcalfe's law](
We continue to see [more and more interest in Bitcoin as seen by Google Trends](  Note that the interest has recently fallen to "just" the level held by the Japanese Yen.
We can expect Interest in Bitcoin, and Bitcoin's price to continue to rise in a "Bubbly" fashion.  The next "Bubble" would begin soon, run for a few months, then fade over a few months leaving Bitcoin about 4 to 5 times higher.  The second bubble of the year would then pick up right at the end of the year, and take us into 2015.
Or maybe traders and Wall Street will begin to notice the pattern, and the bubbles and valleys might dampen off to a more steady rise.  But the rise will continue, I believe.
I can't tell the future, so nobody should pay more attention to my timelines than anyone else's.  I do think we can identify and measure the pressures driving up the price.  These are adoption, investment, and publicity. These pressures have not gone away, but are rising.  This makes me very bullish on Bitcoin for the long run.

Just like they can go after Arron Swartz despite his using an open network, licensed access, and an unlocked closet to access public domain (yet gated) information.

Deflationary means prices fall and wages gain in real purchasing power.  Inflationary means prices rise and wages fall in real purchasing power.
A steady diet of inflation should yield low real wages, high corporate profits, and a concentration of wealth with a very few.  At least until the system collapses because workers cannot afford training, nor provide a market for the goods produced.
Bitcoin during the adoption phase is too deflationary.  But once significant adoption is achieved, it will only increase in value relative to productivity.  Maybe 2 to 6 percent per year.
 bitcoin will level wealth over time,  and is key to sustainable economies.  Because we cannot assume infinite growth.

[Factom]( was created to provide immutable audit trails ... It allows the construction of specific, unique chains of user defined data.
The idea here is that governments, banks, financial institutions, insurance companies, contractors, etc. can place hashes of data into specific chains for verification and validation at a later date.
1) Given a chain, you can validate that documents and data provided has not been altered.
2) Given a chain, you can prove that documents and data are not missing.
3) Given a chain, you can prove documents and data have not be post dated.
This allows not just the auditing of financial transactions (though it absolutely could document such transactions), but it also allows the auditing of simple business processes. 
Transparency isn't just about financial records, but is also about tracking decisions, and proving not only what you have published, but what you are not publishing.

You think all miners will merge mine Factom's hashes?  I doubt that.... Why do you think 100% of miners will agree to do something like merge mine these hashes, but won't agree to support OP_RETURN?  
There is quit a bit of value to be had in using a transaction over other means of communication.  I'm not quite sure how is communicate my hashes to the miners, for example.  And I have other questions.
We can always switch over to the merged mining approach at a later time.  It wouldn't change the consensus algorithm or the use of Factom.

Actually, believe it or not, the reason we do not see a spike in price levels to correspond with the spike in the monetary base doesn't have anything to do with Austrians being wrong.
Nor does it have to do with Keynesian economics being right.
Both camps believe prices do not spike along with growth in the money supply for the same reason: most of the money supply isn't created by the monetary base.  The actual working money supply is created by fractional reserve banking, where people come to believe the numbers they see when they look at their bank accounts.  Those numbers do not represent dollars held for you, but rather how many dollars the bank owes you.  
Because people budget and spend based on balances held in banks, a very small amount of money can support many times as much economic activity.
Coupled with the fact that the money in circulation is more critical to setting prices than the actual supply, the monetary base can be grown without increasing prices nearly so much.
The way we grow our money supply is more critical IMHO.  The current monetary policy (i.e. insure inflation, always) will increase the income gap, where wage earners (even high wage earners, with the exception of the most elite) will earn less in real value over time as measured by GDP per capita.   This is also supported by Keynesian and Austrian economics, though the camps do not agree upon the mechanism.  
And Keynesians are more likely to hide from the natural conclusions from their own economic theories when discussing the income gap.

The concern is that if the servers can identify a ChainID, then they might not wish to record entries for that ChainID.
So the entry is paid for up front with an EntryHash.  When the Entry is presented, it clearly hashes to the payment, and it specifies a particular ChainID, so the protocol is already obligated to place the entry into the Factom Records.
Any delay or refusal to put entries in a particular chain on the part of a server will be obvious with data analysis what they are doing.  Then the fact that users vote servers into or out of the Federated Pool of Servers means that the community can vote them off.

Overstock will hold bitcoin if there crop up more Coinbase enabled companies that accept Bitcoin (the  protocol).  Because using the  protocol makes spending the currency easier.

You discount Edmond Moy NOT because he doesn't understand banking/economics/finance.  You never once indicated any reason to doubt THAT.  Instead you cast doubt BECAUSE his post is only tangentially associated with Banking and Finance.  
Do you have any reason to believe that he really lacks understanding of banking/economics/finance?  Did you present any? No, you only point out his post isn't really part of the banking and finance system.  It is reasonable to conclude that you are saying the OP and others so look at the position one has to indicate understanding...  I think I can be forgiven for interpreting you by what you said.
I will note that your actual words are: "Its clear OP make a big deal out of his statements because OP mistakenly **though his post** is proof of his expertise and understanding of the topic.
The same goes that it isn't proof of a lack of expertise, but it *is proof that many positions in government are willing to call for competition to the banks*.  It is that point that I made.




Right.  I'd have a hard time understanding me.  What did I say again?  "Are you really **that loyal** to your bank? To the company that holds your Mortgage?"
Please note I never used the word "hate".  Yet in your reply, you stuffed that word into my mouth twice, along with "evil" and an opposition to paying back loans....  
Seriously, all I presented was support for competition to the banks.  The exact sentiment expressed by Edmond Moy.... And from that you infer a call to "hate" the "evil" banks because we don't want to be "forced to repay loans?"

Gyft!  Gift cards for Bitcoin!  Simple!  And 3 percent discount too, when paying with Bitcoin!
As Bitcoin becomes globally popular, I don't think exchanging Bitcoin for local currency is going to be that hard of a problem for most countries.  In some countries, Bitcoin is in such demand it goes for the highest prices.  In Argentina, selling a Bitcoin gets you as much as 7550 ARS ( 1 ARS == 0.15 dollars, or $1132).
Certainly, exchanging Bitcoin (only requires an Internet or phone connection) with a local currency (requires coins in your hand) is just not that hard technically, and nearly impossible to prevent by force or law.

Yes, misread the date, but the fact remains that china remains behind over the year (even if there is a bump up in September).  This isn't the "opposite of what you said".
The Fed did indeed stop QE3.  The holdings are still way high from the beginning of QE1.   And if the economy fails to respond, there will be a QE4.  Japan surprised everyone with their new round.
If you only look at the last couple of months, you are correct.  If you look at any trends over time, I am absolutely correct.
The difference between you and I isn't the data.  It is how you are reading the data, verses my cynical view that we are in a lull and nothing is truly fixed.
On China, I am dead on.  The only reason China may change course is due to the Oil war undercutting their Russian friends in their hopes for a BRIC currency of one sort or another to replace the dollar.  That may reverse their position into buying treasuries.  But that will not be because the Dollar is so good.  It will be because BRIC is so hurt.

LIBOR sets currency exchange rates.  LIBOR rate fixing scandal involved only 300 trillion in transactions, and not so much debt resolution between banks.
 The scam you are looking for is the credit default swap rate fixing scandal, pretty much the same players, but fixing the prices when trading debt, involving 500 trillion in transactions.

So.... ?  
I actually believe there is a HUGE amount of auditing and regulation checks that go on in banks.  
How does that prove there isn't any need for better verification and validation?  We used to do huge amounts of data entry too.  Doesn't mean automation didn't drastically lower the costs of data entry.
**Edit**:  Just in case you missed the whole "Cooked Books" issues with banks: [Book-Cooking Bank Gets to Keep Cooked Books](  Just because audits are done, doesn't mean they are correct, and customers don't get to examine after the fact for themselves should wrong doing be found.

Any dollar not converted into Bitcoin is a loss.
I find the whole "deflation stops  economic activity" argument so stupid.  Supply and demand.  Eventually prices are low enough to spur sales.  That's why we have sales (where we lower prices) to get people to buy.
As long as you don't have cascading defaults, deflation both increases the money people have to spend in real terms, and prompts people to spend because prices are low.
That makes just as much sense as the idea people are natural savers and will starve to save if money hold its value.

Conversations with some long time Bitcoin people led to this observation:  
**Factom is really an implementation of a general purpose data layer over Bitcoin.**

enumerable, etc.  Only Factom is for general data, not strictly transactions.

Some system collects entries and creates the structures that you are merging together to put small hashes into the blockchain.  Certainly the client could do this, but if you have 100 clients, that's 100 Bitcoin transactions every 10 minutes?  
Also, the data needs to be hashed around so that getting the list of information on a chain is quick and easy.  You again can do that on multiple devices, but it is likely easier to do in one place, i.e. a server.
What is a server?  Well, it wouldn't have to be a rack based system, but in the case of Factom it likely will be, as it is processing quite a bit of data.  But if your application has little demand, I'd guess you could run it on any system you are willing to keep up.

We will do this on feature at a time then.  First feature I like as a tax payer in this situation:
The entire transfer is Publicly auditable.
Because Bitcoin separates the ability to spend from the ability to audit. We can see the transfer on the blockchain.
This is very powerful.  Governments could use Bitcoin to make transparent the distribution of funds.  
If the government uses a data layer on top of the blockchain like [Factom]( then the government could  create and require audit trails for even dollar transfers and business processes. Such an approach could bring real time transparency to business processes like the issuing of RFPs and awarding contracts, and managing projects, etc. These audit trails would be subject to formal and separate audits as they are today anyway.  But honesty in reporting would be assured as the audit trails themselves could be public in real time, and all would know these audit trails can not have backdated entries, modified entries, or deleted entries... and the audit trails could contain as well the documentation of the independent audits of the audit trails, removing deniability if the independent audits turn out to be faked or poorly done.

You have a set of federated servers that double check every single decision, in real time.  As long as the users elect a majority of trusted servers, you can trust the outcomes.  Furthermore, those decisions get hashed together into the blockchain.  As long as that gets built and secured properly, you can trust Factom for your application.
Assuming your Chain requires signed entries to implement its processes, then the only action a server can take against the protocol that we cannot audit is the failure to record entries, i.e. censorship.  You can see your entries delayed in real time, and such actions will slow down censored users.  But the servers cannot inject bogus entries without users simply rejecting them.  And the users will be able to punish servers that do that by withdrawing support and removing them from the federated server pool.
So yes, I think that Factom will be secure for publishing lists of time stamped entries.  And that is pretty much all you need to support some pretty powerful protocols.

An Audit is only as good as the records used to create the audit.
All I am saying is that blockchain technology allows for the creation of audit trails of transactions and business processes that are validated as part of business, then verifiable as the basis of an Audit.
The lack of such verification and validation when records are either not kept, intentionally or unintentionally obfuscated, and stepwise validation is manual (not automated) necessarily leads to inaccurate audits.
The fact that drugs and other criminal enterprises make up an estimated 300 billion dollar plus business, where funds have been laundered through banks like HSBC proves that the need for transaction verification and validation is insufficient in the current financial system. 
So maybe I am stupid.  Maybe there isn't any need for verified and validated transactions.  But it seems to me we are making headway on these fronts with Bitcoin.  In only 5 years.  How long have these things been problems for the financial system?

Beating the existing network doesn't allow changes to past transactions, nor does it allow for accepting invalid transactions.  And a hardware attack like this can not break all  cryptocurrencies...

Actually... Regulations are not going to outweigh gains from economies of scale as Bitcoin grows.
Here they estimate transaction costs at rates that will fall with higher use of Bitcoin, as higher use across the economy will nearly eliminate the need for Bitcoin to dollar conversions.  Short term credit costs to cover slow payment systems.  Eliminated regulations because Bitcoin cannot be counterfeited, and is transactionally secure.  Escrow services cannot steal any on the funds they oversee  (multisig is a wonder!).  
Bitcoin is likely to drop the costs to the economy of banking and finance dramatically.  Far more than this analysis details, not less.

The dollar's worth is defined by what you can purchase with it.  By definition of "worth".

as "the coin and paper money of the United States or any country that is designated as legal 
tender and circulates and is customarily used and accepted as a medium of exchange in the 
country of issuance." Because neither centralized virtual currencies nor cryptocurrencies are coin

under the statute. **Therefore absent a legislative change to the statute, no currency exchange 
license is required in Texas to conduct any type of transaction exchanging virtual with sovereign

Well, yes of course.  And outside of an adoption phase, you will not even see a linear rise in a log graph.  But the vertical phase of adoption will appear as a steeper slope in the log graph.


Not so much.  The rise from the beginning to June of 2011 differed by 30 degrees from the slope from October of 2011 to January of 2013.  Which has been off 15 degrees or so upward over the last year.
That is just looking at 1 year + trends.  You have all sorts of other slopes at smaller time intervals.
Based on 2012, you would have expected a Bitcoin price of 90 to 100 dollars at the end of 2013.  ~15 degrees difference is a ~10X shift over a year.   A much harder thing to predict than some give it credit for.


The log graph, sans an extreme disruption in Bitcoin adoption, would suggest a quicker rise, maybe in 1.5 years to 2 years.  It just depends on which slope you believe in.  I actually think 2014 should beat 2013.  Then maybe in 2015 or 2016 we start leveling off...  Assuming we start to saturate the online population.  And  Eric Schmidt of Google fame thinks everyone will be online by 2020, up from 30 percent today.

There is something to that.  Projects that can be funded get done, those that can not get funding don't.  I mean, even Satoshi had some kind of support (even if he was working nights) and has control of a whale of a lot of bitcoin as a result.
This model aligns incentives in a way that results in open development, open source, and a decentralized autonomous protocol, and can still raise funds that can make it real.  Going forward, the rewards are paid out to insure those running the protocol are paid the majority of the factoids very quickly.  And the architecture is uniquely designed to support store front interfaces that eliminates the need of customers to hold factoids.
In the end, we will not have a position relative to Factom that has any advantage at all built into the protocol.  Our software license is the most open possible.  The only rewards anyone will have is just some of the factoids which itself will be openly disclosed.  Everyone contributing will get a share.

If I can count the ways CoinVault is advanced here, and it is more than one, then that makes it "Many".  Like the fact that it was their ATM, their association with the revenue, their guy in the picture, their ability to point to this as a success, their ability to draw Bitcoin events to the venue, etc.
So is "Many" here subjective?  Not at all.  Bitcoin is a protocol that is completely decentralized and outside the control of any one party.
People think that means that Bitcoin is this completely decentralized system of payments.  That isn't true. Payments can be decentralized with Bitcoin, but most businesses need more interesting services than just the decentralized part of Bitcoin. All the companies that provide Bitcoin support and Bitcoin payment processing are centralized companies.

Overdrafts mostly occur because banks refuse to process transactions immediately (or at least in a time frame that is pretty close to immediate).   Thus consumers can be confused about how much money they have in an account, and they make mistakes.
I have had many overdrafts through the years.  None of them were an attempt by me to take out a loan.  
On the other hand, I have taken out loans.... Never have I paid $35 in lending fees for a $5 loan, but I have paid such an overdraft fee before.  Usually after the bank has ordered the drafts from largest to smallest in order to get 5 or 10 overdrafts when they could have taken only one.  That kind of behavior isn't at all like taking a loan.
The recent reform (link I provided above) discusses the drop in income by banks when they were bared from charging overdrafts at ATMs, since they already know to refuse the transaction if there isn't a balance available.  I don't recall anyone yelling about not being able to get "loans" as a result...

* We need to charge something to prevent total spamming of what is essentially a publishing system.
* We wanted a system that allowed users to avoid any cryptocurrency.
* If we used a token, we wanted to make sure that it didn't have to leave the protocol to be useful.
* We wanted a system that could make payments through the protocol to incentivize people to support the protocol (like Bitcoin pays miners bitcoin).

Big picture is that the organization is a sort of tree of chains (not to be confused with Tree Chains).  At the highest level, Factom creates a list of ChainIDs and EntryBlock hashes, which holds the hashes of all the entries received in the last minute.  Those hashes lock down the entries.
The Factom structures are distributed via a Distributed Hash Table (DHT) like a torrent.  We have a client that will parse through this data to create a representation for local applications.
Of course, an application can do their own parsing and implement their own databases.  But our client software will give applications a standard interface, including HTTP REST interfaces.


We will run Full nodes that have all the data.  The Factom Servers will also run full nodes.  Users will run anything from ChainID specific nodes (which disregard data not in a set of Chains) to full nodes that have everything.
All of the Factom structures will be retrievable.  Because the architecture allows users to collect and share data on their chains and not other chains, then frequently used chains will be more quickly accessed than less frequently used chains.

Given that Banking has been the recipient of technology for the last 40 years (they didn't invent computers after all), it is ignorant to claim that banks don't have anything to learn from a technology like Bitcoin.  After all, THEY are the ones holding conferences to come up to speed on bitcoin.  Why would they do that if they have nothing to learn?
On the other hand, the Bitcoin community does have "TONS to learn" from the modern banking system.  Some, like regulations about transaction security and counterfeiting, just do not apply.  Different regulations will apply because of different risks due to different processes.


That's just dumb.  Bitcoin clearly solves some problems the modern banking industry has NOT solved, and goes along ways towards addressing many others.  GAAP, regulations, and audits do not prevent cooked books, fudged books, counterfeiting, stolen credit cards, missing piles of cash, money laundering, etc.


You absolutely can.  You can create an off-blockchain of your own transactions.  Then log your hashes into the Bitcoin blockchain.  You don't need any difficulty at all (you get that by submitting to Bitcoin).  You can't change your blockchain without losing validation against the Bitcoin blockchain.
Then your bank audits can reference their own internal blockchain.  Any transaction outside of, or different from the blockchain would be a clear indication of at best an error, and more likely fraud.  And in fact, all sorts of business steps could be logged into such a banking blockchain to insure business processes were properly followed.  It is just about automation of provable records, properly timestamped, and tamper proof.  
All very cheap too.

Factom is structured to allow for the distribution of parts of the structures.   We are looking at incentives to insure, collectively, all the data is being held.  The idea that has some traction right now is to create bounties for returning proofs on random elements in chains.  Clearly a node that has the data has the advantage in returning the answer and collecting the bounty.
On the other hand, not all the nodes have to collect the same data.  And really popular data will have many nodes.  So nodes looking for the bounties will look for poorly covered data in Factom, where the competition will be light.

Simple.  You climb a cliff... You fall.  You don't get to land on that nice ledge 10 feet down.  You fall all the way and smash at the base.
You may not have noticed, but we replaced all those manual systems used in the 50's with computers.  My family (ten aunts and uncles, grand parents) all moved off the farm and into urban professions.  Well, that and grew old and died.  We don't have people in the numbers we would need that can and know how to farm manually anymore.
You don't get a population scaled back to the 50's levels, you get 7 billion people.  You don't get three nuclear powers, you get 5 to 7, and as many as 19,000 nuclear warheads.
You get global warming, stressed environmental conditions, oil spills, fires, 
The loss of computers and tech present vast survival problems for humanity; it won't end well.
I wish we could just have the 50's all over again too.  But that isn't possible.  
If we really lose 75 to 80 percent of the population, gold is worthless.  So is cash.  So is Bitcoin.  
 If we take 40 years to slide out of a technological based economy back to an agricultural economy.... Well, maybe gold will work.  But I don't see how that scenario (slow slide) is possible without preserving computers and communications.  And that's all Bitcoin needs. 
So pretty much any scenario where humanity mostly survives, we get to have computers and networks.  And maybe Bitcoin plays a role to insure trade continues and our networks survive  through the next financial crash....

No, a year for sidechains to be real isn't a long time.  However, I think a year is optimistic.  Changes to the Bitcoin protocol are very, very hard to deploy. 
Additionally sidechains require the acquisition of  mining power for security.  Merge mining is a partial solution, but it comes with risks as well.  (After all, PoW acquired from merge mining could be used to attack a sidechain as easily as it can be used to secure the sidechain.)
Lastly, sidechains present the possibility of eclipsing Bitcoin, just like any altcoin might.  I think that is the least likely scenario (the most likely scenario is sidechains never happen), but it deserves mention.


I'd say that we are too early in the race to quite declare a winner for the cryptocurrency of dominance in adoption and importance.  Most realistic estimates of Bitcoin users falls between 250,000 to maybe 1,000,000, of which 950 own most the Bitcoin.   
That said, I am doing everything I can to insure Bitcoin wins.  So none of this has anything to do with me having identified a competitor for Bitcoin that I'd like to take dominance.  But after 35 years watching technology, I have become gun shy of declaring I know how it will progress. 


We have had multiple currencies long, long before central banks.  Prior to paper money, chipping and thinning was about all that could be done to inflate currency.  Currencies have been based on lots of stuff, but most common silver, copper, and gold.  And these currencies have coexisted for hundreds if not thousands of years.
In the present day, we have piles of payment systems that coexist where the currency desired doesn't do what we like.  Airline miles, reward points, (even greenstamps once upon a time) etc.  Altcoins will thrive in the same fashion, providing some feature interesting to merchants and the market without being any realistic attempt to replace Bitcoin. 


While I would bet on Bitcoin, my point is that about 1/2 a teaspoon of the "milkshake" has been exposed to date, and of that Bitcoin didn't get it all.   So when truly big players make their move, the few billion in market cap in Bitcoin will mean nothing.  You don't yet have the unassailable position in Bitcoin you describe.
The individuals that have to be convinced of the value of Bitcoin's network are the ones that need to come in to push Bitcoin adoption by 1000+ fold to reach a billion people.  The corporate, government, and cultural populations could move into another technology.  We shouldn't kid ourselves and claim they have no other choice but Bitcoin.

The world of coin based distributed applications could very well eliminate "money".  If all the tokens earned were from an individual's efforts to contribute to some distributed application, then the value of the tokens compared to other tokens would be defined by the value of the applications involved.  So App Token A and App Token B would have relative values depending upon the value of the applications behind A and B.  
Now as you use your B tokens to get access to the A App, you are in effect bartering the value you contributed to the B App to gain access to the value of the A App.
In effect, the world becomes a barter system, and with enough tokens the concept of money is fragmented and distributed...

After 495 bank failures in the financial sector in the US since 2008, you can hardly claim regulation prevents meltdowns.  
Mt.Gox.  pointed out that structuring an exchange in the same way we have always done (centralized control, no public audits) presents a huge risk.
Cryptographic proof of reserves, and cryptographic proof of process can provide mechanisms to audit in a transparent, real time, public fashion that has to date been utterly impossible.  And in the Bitcoin world, there has been a push to provide these kinds of audits for exchanges following Mt.Gox.
Is anyone calling for this kind of transparency for banks?  No.  I was talking about Bitcoin exchanges. A number of Bitcoin exchanges submitted to the public cryptographic audits.  But I do believe once an idea has been demonstrated as effective, we will see such audits applied more widely, as the public becomes aware that there are ways to publicly and securely audit banks, the government, and charities. 
Your dismissal of the lessons to be learned from Mt.Gox. reminds me of how poor programming teams approach bugs.... When a kind of bug (like a buffer overflow vulnerability) is found, the just fix the bug.  Over and over and over.  As if each situation was somehow unique.
Great programming teams realize that there is a pattern, and that with a process change they can eliminate the whole class of bugs, now and in the future.  Sometimes by using a particular library, or insisting on a particular pattern of coding.  But the lesson is that when you see a failure that isn't unique, you should look for tools that simply stop the whole class of failures.
The 495 bank failures in the U.S. since 2008 followed a pattern.  It parallels the pattern we saw with the Savings and Loan crisis, and that we saw with Mt. Gox. And the failures will continue, because we are not looking for a fix to the class of problems that lead to these failures.  Well, at least not in the general financial sector.

This is true, but to document a business process, you cannot place multiple hashes in one transaction using OP_RETURN.  You are limited to 40 bytes.
If you encode information into the blockchain via other mechanisms (like multi-sig) then you inflate the number of unspent transactions (which bitcoin nodes and wallets have little way of pruning), and your transaction costs go up because the transactions are larger thus more expensive.

If a merchant would simply query the top 7 mining pools, and 10 or 20 random nodes, they could detect the attempt to undo a transaction as soon as it is made.  So a payment with an immediate undo will not fly.
Suppose the thief waits 3 or 4 minutes to get away before they attempt an undo.  Their odds of success will have fallen quite a bit, making them resort to transactions formed intentionally to delay their acceptance.  
But All of those hacks to the transaction to make sure it is slow (i.e. adding an OP_RETURN, low transaction fee, etc.) in favor of some alternative transaction are also easily tested immediately.  So immediately the store can reject those payments.
We need some work on this topic, for sure.  But it remains that there exist solutions...

As you will so claim, nobody forces anything on miners or full nodes.  They can refuse to relay (or include) as they wish. And an OP_RETURN clearly signals the intent of the server (as opposed to many other encoding schemes).  
By the way, I don't know what definition of "disregards" you are using in this context.  Obviously if someone is submitting a Transaction to a network of nodes, they clearly are not "disregarding" anyone. They are requesting support.  Maybe if the submitter is hiding or obfuscating what they are asking for. But if the submitter is using an OP_RETURN, they are clearly signaling what they are doing.
I am not sure how anyone could be more transparent and honest about this use of Bitcoin.  After all, if I get miners to include data, then the full nodes are FORCED to either go along and accept the blocks, or fork into oblivion.  
Seems to me if a full node objects to merged mining, then they are better off with OP_RETURN ... at least they can have some kind of say (by not transmitting the transactions)... but just being a full node gives you no say in how miners construct their blocks.


They have no obligation under the protocol to include transactions for any reason.  Black lists, OP_RETURN, transaction fees, transaction counts, input counts, output counts, whatever.  They can even use a lottery to determine transactions to be included or excluded.  There is nothing in the protocol that stipulates what they must accept as transactions in the blocks they mine.
And as long as a miner has the hash power to back up their decisions, they can enforce their rules on any block they manage to mine.  And obviously such a miner can submit their code to other like minded miners (or even miners that just don't know what is in the code they are running) to increase their influence.  All without anyone's say for or against them, outside of anyone supporting said miner with hash power.

* Government (boarder security, police forces, fire departments, etc.)
* Our food supply.  
* Energy distribution
* Transportation
* Medical technologies, like medicine, hospitals, etc.
* Education
* Banking and Finance (all national currencies)
* International Trade
* Entertainment (movies, music, restaurants, travel, etc.)

It remains that if you can communicate with the pools (and thus with the miners) about what transactions they are seeing, you can in a few queries know what transactions are being included in blocks.  Given that it is in the absolute interest of the miners to make the network secure, there is little reason for the pools and the miners to purposely hide the transactions that they are working on.
And as for pools becoming more decentralized, we really haven't seen that yet as a significant trend, have we?
I could imagine a service that does this kind of analysis for merchants such that miners could be polled (and even provide an api to report) the transactions being included in the blocks being hashed.  Thus they wouldn't have to be polled by every single merchant.  The service then could flag attempted double spends as they occur, and merchants wouldn't have to maintain lists of miners and Bitcoin nodes.

[Factom]( seeks to move these kinds of applications into a general data layer that is, none the less, secured by Bitcoin via anchors using OP_RETURN.
The difference is that Factom can allow any number of entries to be secured by Bitcoin, yet only drop a OP_RETURN into Bitcoin once every 10 minutes.
OP_RETURN itself is a low overhead transaction.  It doesn't add to the Unspent Transaction Output database, and the output doesn't have to be validated (because it is unspendable anyway).   Factom stands to move all this sort of application off the blockchain and enable way more functionality at a very small overhead to the blockchain.

"Used correctly" is baked into Bitcoin for transactional security (I.e. just transacting in bitcoin never puts the customer or merchant at risk of theft by an observer in the middle),  for anti counterfeiting ( transactions are validated against the block chain . Thus Bitcoin simply cannot be counterfeited).
Audits of accounts can be done, also without risk of theft.  (Access to banking, credit, trading, and other financial  accounts risk embezzlement). Escrow accounts can be implemented without risk of theft by the holding party.

"out of thin air" is a reference for the idea of creating money without having ever done anything to earn it.  With Bitcoin, nobody gets to simply generate Bitcoin without being part of some valid economic activity.  Bookkeeping is a valid activity, and that is what Bitcoin miners do.

The point is that not all goods and services can be scaled down in cost at the same rate over time.
Highly technical goods and services have fallen in price so much that even with inflation, the costs of those goods and services have fallen dramatically.  
Goods and services that rely heavily on labor and human processes (like learning skills) are not as subject to the same level of improvement from technology, i.e. we cannot automate learning or teaching the way we can automate the manufacture of computer chips.

Actually, what you have is a revealable secret.  This is a rather powerful feature.  Nobody looking at just the hashes can know what it is you have documented.  After all, you wouldn't want your medical records available for everyone to see.  On the other hand, you DO want your doctor's treatment plan documented so that it can be reviewed later.
While the hashes are not understandable to the population, anyone with the documents can verify them.
There are a wide range of cryptographic techniques you can employ, once you have an immutable ledger to build upon.

They are always ahead of *most* malware developers.  And many attacks are thwarted before software is released, and found by white hats before black hats many times.  
Trusted computing and cryptographic proofs of reserves and multi factor authentication and many other tech applies to Bitcoin.  Not to credit cards.  And insurance can apply to both.
And holding up malware against Bitcoin is dumb in light of how much malware costs us already.  And the only solution we have today is insurance.  And Bitcoin is easier to insure ultimately because we can actually secure Bitcoin.

Note that Fraud != theft.
Bitcoin is still subject to theft, but it is transactionally safe.  Target isn't possible with Bitcoin.
That vastly reduces regulations with transactions, because the lion share of those have to do with protecting the customer from fraud due to credit card theft, identity theft, etc.  You can know everything about me you want, but you actually have to steal my Bitcoin from me, unless I entrust it to a third party.  The current system ONLY supports trusted third parties.

Actually education costs have risen faster than inflation for 100 years, in all countries, under all polices. 
We define inflation as the changes in prices... Where does that account for automation, out sourcing, just in time manufacturing, and other tech that lowers the real costs of producing goods and services?
**Edits below as I fat thumbed a couple words...** 
**~~Of~~ If**  education costs **~~feel~~ fell** at the same rate as the cost of computer memory or disk storage,  you would have high school educations that took an hour and cost 20 dollars.

Thank you.  That is actually enough to validate my post, as I am NOT claiming Bitcoin in 5 years is more sophisticated and powerful than a banking system that has existed for over 100 years.

No, this means that we are still on the way down side of a steep learning curve. You should read up on Open Transactions.  In fact, centralized systems can be constructed such that even their internal transactions are provably authorized.
Bitcoin isn't a finished system. The ability to catalog, sign, and embed into the blockchain hashes of transactions means that you can 1) prove what transactions occurred in a closed system, 2) prove no transactions have been omitted or added, and 3) validate your audit against a provably correct and complete record.  Even off blockchain.

Factom actually keeps the information off blockchain, using its own structures, and distributes them over the systems running Factom nodes.  It is a separate P2P network, much like Bitcoin's.
All the entries we receive over 10 minutes are combined via a Merkle Tree to place the single hash (the Merkle root) into the blockchain.  In that way we reduce bloat.
Users put their entries into their own chains.  They create them, define the rules for their chains, and populate them.  Chains all have their own proofs that drive to the Bitcoin Blockchain.  If you have your chain and your data, you don't need anyone else's data.  So effectively, there is no limit on the entries we can process, but at the same time other users don't get bogged down in your data.

A Federal Reserve Note is supposed to represent some value. But that value is continually diluted through various mechanisms in the banking and financial system. So a note today won't necessarily equal a note tomorrow if there are way more notes tomorrow then there are today.  The value behind the note (and there is supposed to be value behind any note) is devalued if there are issued way more notes without any corresponding increase in the value behind the note.
Just like a stock in a company  today will not equal a stock tomorrow if there's been a split, additional stock has been issued, or the company  issuing the stock has become worthless.
In other words, anytime you claim you have a note , the value of the note is tied to something that isn't the note itself. That used to be a gold standard for the dollar.  Today it is simply the prices of goods that you can use the note to buy. If you inflate the number of notes available for the purchase of goods faster then you increase the number of goods that can be purchased, you obviously, obviously, obviously reduce the value of the note.
It is ridiculous to claim that a note has value simply because it will still be a note in the future.
"It ain't worth a continental!" This cliche's meaning depends upon the understanding that a [continental dollar was worthless]( It was worthless because we just printed a bunch of paper to pay for the Revolutionary War here in the United States, but we didn't have any reserves to back it up.  Yet nobody would have denied that a continental dollar was a continental dollar.  Clearly a continental dollar could be a continental dollar and be worthless all at the same time.

First off, let's agree that Mastercoin (MSC) is just another specification for building a colored coin.  If you would a bunch more possible implementations of colored coins, then read the paper on [Colored Coins - BitcoinX by Yoni Assia, Vitalik Buterin, Leor Hakim, Meni Rosenfeld]( and in particular read the section on alternate algorithms.  (The one I came up with is "Alternative Tagging-based Coloring").
Nothing about tracking assets over Bitcoin (i.e. colored coins) requires an algorithm to be "good" or "the best".  Mastercoin might be a bad one, but it is none the less a colored coin algorithm, technically.


Why would you create a colored coin to represent an asset, and not charge people something to acquire it?
If there is some (perhaps insignificant charge) to a third party to gain some advantage (perhaps an infrastructure to allow your colored coin to be more easily traded and used), then who cares?  
With MSC, bitcoin is transferred, but only the minimum amount, which can even be refunded to the sender if you wish.  You can read the [MSC specification]( and in particular read Appendix A.

Printing money is a means of lowering the value of wages and savings.  
Rather than compete on better quality, technology, process, or regulation, a currency war attempts to lower the cost of doing business in a country at the expense of most of said country's population, and at the expense of those countries with which said country competes.
Lowering the cost of doing business relative to other countries has been, and continues to be, a source of huge conflict in International relations.  If a country subsidizes a key industry to make it more competitive internationally, and exports product below price to a target country, that can be used to destroy that industry in the target country.
It is a way to cheat.  It is a way to steal the value from wages and savings to award it elsewhere.  And we can look to the income gap to decide where "elsewhere" is.

That is truly a fascinating take on what happened between us. 
I don't think we have to go too much further than the idea that bitcoin meetup donations provided the funding that fueled a $750K conference.  (The conference really cost half of that, but even still.)  Maybe we are not talking about the same meetup?  After all, the one I went to didn't come close to covering the $45 dollar per meeting I mostly paid out of pocket at Scholz Garten. (i.e. the meetup ran in the red.  It didn't donate anything, really)
I might very well be at fault for not controlling the costs.  After all, I was the one that quit his job to work on this, and the one that put my own money (over 100K in cash) into the conference.
And despite that, I tried to keep everyone included, despite none of the members living up to sharing liability equally, as we agreed to when we formed the TBA.  And, no, not doing any of the work, none of the planing, and and none of the execution of  the conference ... That doesn't excuse you.
You were included on all decisions (that's in the minutes) and particularly the hackathon and the investment plan.  At the time, you objected to neither.  You had access to all the documents on the google drive until you resigned.  
You resigned because you had stonewalled the reorg required for the investment until our Vendor began to lawyer up.  I never threatened anyone with a lawsuit.  But you did refuse to come to an agreement, effectively blocking the investment, until there was a risk of a lawsuit.  Maybe I was guilty of communicating that risk to you?  Does that mean I threatened you?
That's really all that is going on here.  After I gave up on ever getting a reasonable distribution agreement from you, you were asked to either leave, or we would default. But you didn't want to take on the risk if the investment were to go away.  So you resigned.
Those of us involved in the conference just want to push the technology, and to promote adoption.  We want to provide a forum where all voices can be heard.  
Me, I'd rather to continue to work with the meetup group as I did for a year, as  I am committed to integrating the Bitcoin community into the effort. But if your meetup has to take a side in this issue between us, then I will still work with a meetup group. 
I wish you all the best.  After all, we are just trying to change the world.  Why would we think the road to change would be a smooth one?  Hint:  It isn't
Good luck.

Another problem with proof of publishing is that you can prove documents, but not the negative, I.e. this document isn't published.  You can prove the negative on a list.  Factom provides lists to it's users.  So an app can create a list, have users sign and acknowledge the list, then add their hashes and data.  
This allows auditing of the interactions and business processes.

Well, obviously if we are taking thousands of entries and paying only one TX fee, we can make money while saving money.
On the other hand, Factom is about creating chains of entries.  That builds an audit trail.
You can't build an audit trail from simple proof of publication.  An audit trail also requires relating each entry with another, and separated from entries that are not related.
We call this Proof of Process.  And there are aspects such as uniqueness of the chain, order, validation, etc. that make this problem very interesting.

Privacy in Bitcoin depends on discipline and security by obscurity.  If you only have wages as income, mixing then every month or twice a month isn't that hard, and paying bills from the resulting piles of btc addresses leaves one pretty private.

I'm not sure... Bitcoin is increasingly easy to spend.  It's distribution mechanism is clearly more fair than the distribution of dollars.  It is really hard to defend free money to bankers compared to having to work to secure and process transactions as Monet's do.
Deflation is only evil when you have cascading defaults, like when more money is owed them exists, which by definition we have when the money supply I is based on debt.

Kind of a Meh thing.  Yeah, looking at a price of .001 for a candy bar looks strange.  But go to Japan and the same dollar candy bar is 100 yen.  A 200 dollar phone is 20000 yen.
You get used to this stuff.  And we will change the unit of accounts.  People talk about this all the time, and most charting programs use mBTC (BTC/1000) today.


Trading volume spikes when the price rises, and falls afterwards.  Here is the [transaction volume]( on the Bitcoin network, excluding popular addresses which measures what the masses are doing rather than big players and exchanges.
With Bitcoin, we have an advantage over dollars... we can see more of the data.  It can be hard to understand, but there is little doubt in my mind that we are continuing an adoption curve.


The world is a surprising place sometimes.  I don't have an argument with you, only that other scenarios are possible.  Like the developing world becoming the real driver with flip phone, SMS based wallets driving adoption. [Google trends has Kenya with 29 percent search volume compared to the US 86.](   6 months ago, only South Africa showed up in the trends.  There are now 6 or 7 countries that show up.


We will get stability when the price of Bitcoin goes over 10K.  Maybe 100K.  The fact is that too few people are using Bitcoin, and most are speculating.  That is changing (and changing really fast, if you look at Bitcoin year to year). To let people get in, the price has to go up to make room.


Bitcoin will not kill the banks.  But Bitcoin provides a hugely novel concept to them:  Honesty.
You see, you can't audit Wall Street or the banks today without having access to the same information you could potentially use to rip them off.  The account numbers and databases of a bank are only secure if you limit access to them.
Bitcoin (and other cryptocurrencies) separates the ability to spend from the ability to audit.  With Bitcoin, you can not only allow audits without fear of the auditors stealing your funds, but you can let everyone audit. In real time.  Because the master books are available to everyone.
IF the fed wishes to print 9 trillion dollars as they did in 2010, then one, they couldn't do it.  But IF they had a "FedCoin" that let them do it, they couldn't do it without everyone instantly knowing that they did.
Furthermore, the trading of currency isn't the only thing you can do with cryptocurrencies.  You can also trade assets.  Naked short selling isn't possible using cryptography backed financial transactions.
So no, banks don't go away.  But yes, Bitcoin and cryptography backed financial systems can change how they act.

One of the main ways we are going to make Factom approachable to businesses outside of Bitcoin.
First thing, traditional business can access Factom without cryptocurrencies.  This is because we built the system so that Factoids (the Factom token) are converted to Entry Credits assigned to a public key that are 
* non-transferable
* can only be used to place entries into Factom
This means that "traditional business" can buy access to Factom from someone that has Factoids (like the servers that get Factoids for running the system) using Bitcoin or even a credit card.  Heck, they can set up a subscription with a CC to keep their public key "full".
They don't need a wallet, and they don't need to touch any cryptocurrency.  And since for at least the short term, servers will need to pay bills, this is a way to sell a subscription to a service to get money.
Note:  NOBODY here is a MSB or a MTB.  Entry Credits are the only thing the customer touches, and the protocol and the server are the only parties involved in moving Factoids.  And I am pretty sure the law doesn't consider a protocol a party in a transaction.

We may have to agree to disagree.  I see the purpose of using both as allowing functionality on the Bitcoin Blockchain that isn't there otherwise.  I think we could argue pros and cons of both, as you could all the alternate algorithms for colored coins that are not used by the ChromaWallet.
But at the end of the day, they are providing functionality for the blockchain that is not provided by Bitcoin natively.  And they do it without creating a new blockchain and without needing to recruit miners.  So I don't see either as falling afoul of Daniel's rants.
Please understand, I am not trying to make you believe MSC is a good thing.  I contribute to all of these efforts, in as much as I have the time to do so.  I even contribute to Ethereum, and I would contribute to namecoin as well.  
Because I do not share Daniel's hard line against alt currencies.  I don't find his argument compelling.  It is based on knowledge of the future that I am not sure we have.  I do think there is room for multiple cryptocurrencies, and he believes the network effect is going to prohibit multiple cryptocurrencies.  
I believe the future can resolve itself.  I do not think I have to do anything to make the future resolve.

A centralized database can always replicate the blockchain, as long as you trust them.  Inserting hashes into the blockchain is an innovation that opens the doors to limiting that trust.  Factom only makes such techniques easier to manage and deploy.


Core Logic doesn't seem to be providing validation services for arbitrary documents.


I will have to investigate closer, but I see nothing on their site to suggest they actually monitor accounts.  Given they are behind 1 out of 2 mortgages according to their video, if they do monitor accounts, they would be involved.


Proof of Publication isn't quite the same as Proof of Process.  Not only should documents be published, they must be published within the context of the process in which they are relevant.  While seemingly a minor change, it is actually kind of hard to implement.  Factom intends to make it easy and less expensive.

In particular, would they support legislation made them compete with other technologies, restricted their ability to levy fees, to foreclose on homes.  Guess what?  Most people think competition would force banks to give them a better deal.
Right now we can't move at all against the banks.  Look at the [Barclays gold fixing scandal that broke today](  And they are only fined 26 million pounds.  That doesn't even dent them.
Do you really think the DOJ and other government agencies like the fact that these guys get to flaunt the law?  Do you really think they will be *loyal* to them when decisions about cryptocurrencies are made?  Some will, but not enough to stop the tech.
You don't have to hate a group to lack the kind of loyalty that would require effort on your part to give them their way.  Mostly you just have to vote against them.

Not entirely.... The infrastructure for Bitcoin is building pretty rapidly, given it is just an open source project introduced a bit over 5 years ago to a few cryptography fan boys. 
And the infrastructure in banks for safe deposit boxes is tiny compared to money services.  I'd be happy for you to fold in the energy costs of safe deposit boxes holding cold addresses into the Bitcoin side.... It wouldn't change much....

I would argue that home schooling or self schooling is nothing new, and we have many historical examples.  Abraham  Lincoln had only a year or so of formal schooling, and was mostly self educated.  I kinda think he proved how much better value he got for his efforts than many in formal schooling.
The fact that we can educate outside of a formal system (private or public) presents no economic argument.  We could just as easily move this to live performance of classical music and demonstrate the same effect.  The size of the auditorium, the number of chairs, the number of players in a string quartet, how long it takes to perform a concert... none of this is improved by technology.  And in fact live performance is "increasing in cost" relative to average prices, all for the same reasons.
Baumol's cost disease. Baumol predicted in the 1960's the exact differences in costs of live performance, education, medicine, ordinary consumer goods and services, and computer tech.  And his predictions were spot on.  It is rare to find an economist that makes pricing predictions 50 years out and hits a bulls eye.  Not just in the U.S.A, but the whole world, Europe, the developing world, everywhere.  But nobody is going to talk too much about his work, because the ramifications are not exactly what we would like to consider.  
Because understating inflation and its impact on wages and savings condemns big government.  But it also blows holes in arguments that would blame government and its central planning.  In fact, it is the *cost of central planning* in this case, paid for by printing money, that is at fault rather than central planning itself.  At least, that is my take.

There is no data layer for Bitcoin where you can record messages.  We are working to add a data layer with Factom.
The problem with a general data layer is that that data would end up in everyone's copy of the blockchain.  So we are working on a way that you can secure data with the blockchain without actually adding the data to the blockchain.
There are many applications to this technology, especially if it is constructed so that you don't have to have everyone else's data to support your application.  By organizing such data into lists, you can prove the negative, i.e. there is no data X in the list used by this application.

The slots should have been equated to Bitcoin Addresses.  And so parties would transfer from the balance of a slot they control, to another slot in the "Internet-wide" ledger.
Of course, this too isn't entirely correct. The unspent outputs require a script to be satisfied, which may or may not require a Bitcoin Address.  But nearly all transactions spend to Bitcoin addresses, so it is good enough for the level of the article.

Well sometimes the details take a while both to shake out and to document.  I am working to flush out and document the consensus algorithm we are going to use.  
You yourself might be familiar with the process.  Quite a number of protocols I have watched through the years (not just here in Bitcoin land) take a while to flush out.


Why yes, yes I did.  And these servers act like mining pools, that do nothing other than order entries in the various chains users are setting up.  They have no ability to alter any of the entries because they are signed.  All they can do is censor.
And miners and mining pools can certainly censor too.


This is sort of a pot shot at Factom, but I'm not exactly sure it is accurate.  Factom would allow your banks to buy entry credits with their credit card and assign them to a public key.  Pretty much the same sort of technology used to buy software subscriptions.  Then they can use the key to create a chain, then add entries.  They could later get the chain, and look at the entries.
Other applications could get the chain and look at the entries.  Reading is free, so that is just using the API.
Not exactly sure how much easier it can be.  Are they required to trust an "entity"?  Well, not really.  Once the data is signed and there are proofs rooted in Bitcoin, who do they have to trust?  Is Bitcoin an "entity"?
On the other hand, their chain is absolutely immutable and unique.  All parties working against the same chain can enumerate it and trust the math that it can't be altered.

The idea is that they commit their stuff in Factom, and pretty much all Factom does is build the Merkle root to go into Bitcoin.  No muss, no fuss, you put your data in Factom, and you get a hash into Bitcoin.  Heck, hundreds of thousands of protocols could run on top of Factom.  It doesn't really do anything but build these Merkle Roots.
It turns out that building a distributed autonomous data layer over Bitcoin that puts all of this outside the blockchain isn't as simple as it seems.


No politics at all.  You build your chains, you put your data into them, and the Merkle root is created, and one OP_RETURN written every 10 minutes.  Or one hash gets merge minded in. Anyone that asks for a proof of their chain or their entry can get a set of merkle roots that are all anchored in these OP_RETURNS or hashes, one every 10 minutes in the case of OP_RETURN.  Whatever the frequency if Merge Mined.


Now on the other hand, sharing the actual Merkle root in the block header with many other protocols and mining applications IS a massive political problem. I don't really know how that would work.  When a miner wants to prove the work of hashing a Bitcoin block should be counted to them, how can they simply be a member of a Merkle root?  Wouldn't that mean multiple miners could take credit for the same work?

So.... If the Austrians *agreed* with you, and felt that a liquidity trap would prevent money from entering the economy and thus avoiding inflation.... Then we would have had inflation!?!
Because THAT is what JonnyLay said.  He said we don't have inflation **Because Austrians are wrong. These are the libertarians and bitcoin enthusiasts.** 
No. Austrians being right or wrong has no effect on prices.
Furthermore, what I said is what everyone believes, and that is quite literally that prices don't rise because the added money doesn't necessarily enter the economy.  The idea of liquidity traps is an explanation of why this happens. 
Are Austrians the only ones skeptical of liquidity traps?  No again.  Liquidity traps are rejected by [more groups than just Austrians] ( 


Nobody really knows how QE will unwind.  Much wasn't  a loan, but a purchase of assets.  The base money supply will not shrink as money is repaid nearly so much because not everyone took one out loans under QE (outside of treasuries) So I'm not sure how sound are the breaks on the economy when the fed decides to show things down.

Pet Peeve:  Misunderstanding the costs of education...  People don't seem to understand that the deflationary pressure from technology does not benefit all sectors equally.
That smart phone in your pocket is way more powerful that the first supercomputer, the Cray I.  It weighed 8 tons, sold for 8.8 million dollars.  As one of the first 64 bit computers, the Cray I only had 8 megabytes of main memory.
If education gained the same advantage from technology as computers, a high school education would only cost about 20 dollars and would take an hour and a half to complete.
But the fact is education gains nearly nothing from technology.  High school still takes 12 years.  We still need the same number of square feet per student in our schools.  We need the same teacher student ratios.  Nearly everything that costs education the most on their budgets hasn't budged in cost due to technology. 
But when we talk about inflation, we average education costs WITH computers and other goods and services.  It is like averaging the time it takes a balloon to fall with that of a lead weight to estimate gravity.
In fact, the *real costs of education have fallen*.  They get to use computers and spreadsheets.  Many of their consumer products (art supplies, books, power, audio video, etc.) have gone down in ~~price~~ *real costs in terms of labor and resources*.   It is just that these are not the big budget items.   So the problem is not that education is getting more expensive in real terms.  The problem is that Monetary Inflation is not measured by CPI, so we don't actually adjust for monetary inflation.   The upward pressure on prices is far higher than CPI claims.  And this creates an illusion that education costs are going up, when in fact they just are not falling as fast as the stuff you buy at Walmart, or from the Apple Store.
This misrepresentation of monetary inflation means we (who depend on wages) accept raises year after year that are really pay cuts.  That means that the value of our wages and savings is falling FASTER than we think.
That makes education look more expensive.
In fact, our wages have been decimated far more than we think.

You can't prove to a third party that a set of posts to the Bitcoin Blockchain constitute complete documentation of your business process.  Or at least it wouldn't be easy to do.  
Factom provides a standard that creates lists, which are unique, and constitute all the entries in a record for a business process.
No doubt there are other ways to do this.  Factom seeks to be as simple as it gets method for creating lists of hashes that you can count upon, with cryptographic proofs, of the order of your entries within seconds of submission.
The idea is to trust Factom for 10 minutes, then trust the Bitcoin Blockchain forever.

Mastercoin runs purely on the Bitcoin Blockchain, and accounts for Mastercoin transfers using data inserted into the Bitcoin blockchain.  There is no intermediary alt-coin.
See Appendix A in the [Mastercoin spec](
Mastercoin made initial sells of their "Mastercoins" ... but there is no "middle coin".  It is all Bitcoin blockchain defined.
The only difference between Mastercoin and Colored Coins is how they define their protocol.  Mastercoin inserts their own "Exodus Address" into their protocol.  Colored Coins allows a user to define their own "Genesis Address".  
Liquidity of trading assets is always dependent up on the asset you are trading.  Selling a coin representing a position in a company is never going to be as liquid as a currency, but you can't substitute a currency for a for such a coin.  Obviously if you want to buy a share of a company, you buy that thing even if you know it isn't as liquid as a currency.   You hope it will pay dividends, increase in value faster, or maybe you want to support the effort.  None of that decision is really a question of liquidity.  
So I don't think Mastercoin and Colored Coins compete with Bitcoin so much, and they are not any more "inherently inefficient" as compared to Bitcoin.  They exist to trade assets and perform other functions that Bitcoin simply doesn't provide.  
My criticism of Colored Coins is that they have insisted on actually attempting to tie a literal Bitcoin amount to a colored coin amount in their accounting.  Mastercoin doesn't really do that, but Mastercoin is somewhat premined (not something I entirely like, but I understand why it is).

Point of sale systems need power.


So does a paper wallet.  In fact, I am already carrying a phone, so I don't HAVE to put anything into my wallet...


Nothing credit card companies do is "free".  This is like saying you can reenter a store for free.  So what?


All theft from credit cards is spread out over all users.  Thus you lose to theft with every single purchase.  And "no chance" of loss simply isn't true.  Ultimately the user is responsible for reporting unauthorized charges... 


Exactly.  Anyone who knows the number can use your card.  Ask the owners of the 100+ million card numbers stolen from Target.  Just "knowing a number" could also work for Bitcoin through third party processing.  


Everyone used to use candles for lighting too.


Extracted from the merchants accepting the card.  Again, nothing a CC gives you is free.  It gets paid for with higher prices.  Many accepting Bitcoin give a percentage off because it actually lowers costs.


As can be done if any third party holds you money.  Coinbase provides this feature for their Bitcoin customers.  Of course, Coinbase requires the authorization by the customer.  CC can be " one clicked " by any merchant, authorized and legitimate or not.
**Again, the user experience of CC vs Bitcoin wasn't my point.  I was talking about the seeming requirement for people to understand everything about how Bitcoin works technically even though CC have a much more complicated technical structure...**
That said, it should be noted that Bitcoin can be used to implement anything CC can do, because there isn't anything magic about Bitcoin as a unit of account.  You can let a "bank" hold your Bitcoin, and you can use "payment processors" to manage transactions for your Bitcoin.  
The reverse just isn't true.  You cannot cryptographically secure CC transactions.  You cannot make CC transactions without any centralized third parties.  You cannot send dollars to someone over the Internet without any centralized third parties.
And you cannot hold dollars for a few years without significant loss in the buying power of those dollars.  You cannot work for a wage for a few years without significant loss in the buying power of that wage.  And obviously the buying power of wages even with raises hasn't kept up with the diminished value of dollars/Euros/Yen/Pounds/ etc.  (The yen being a little bit of an exception ... one Abenomics seeks to eliminate).

You couldn't transact in gold easily.  So notes were used instead. You can't wire gold or even notes.  So you use your bank to settle the accounts for you.  At some level, transactions eventually don't even involve the backing currency.
The gold standard drive banks (and nations) to bankruptcy.  They spend or lend more than they have.  This is why major wars result in nations dropping the gold standard.
Bitcoin is directly spendable.  That means a customer can accept *actual* bitcoin, and send *actual* bitcoin to make payments.  Cheaper than banks can exchange promises. 
Banks would have to drastically lower transaction fees to maintain their place, and to fractionalize bitcoin. And if they get called, they can't print bitcoin to make up a deficit.

When was the last time you saw a wave that involves 10 percent of the water of a lake, much less an ocean?


Why?  We are not seeing any slow down in adoption.  Here is the [log graph of transaction rates on a log scale.](  Looks pretty linear (i.e. exponential) to me.


No it isn't.  Because Bitconi acts as a payment system.  In other words it models the M3 money supply, not the M1 money supply.  That is why its value is always higher than expected.  It actually supports transactions, but actually requires the actual bitcoin for each transaction!
Until you understand money supplies, and understand the difference between trading promises for dollars and trading actual Bitcoins, you will not understand the price of Bitcoin.


Right.  Because Bitcoin can't possibly attract anyone but libertarians with its growth in value.
January 1, 2014 saw a 58x growth in value over the previous year.
January 1, 2013 saw a 3x growth in value over the previous year.
January 1, 2012 saw a 13x growth in value over the previous year.
January 1, 2011 saw a 5x growth in value over the 5 months from the opening of Mt. Gox.
Those kinds of returns can't possibly attract anyone but libertarians.


It is the wild west. But you are predicting a &gt; 10X growth in Bitcoin use and value.  Not really a recipe for loss of market share.


Adoption of any currency will be driven by price.  Then network effects will hold its position. Then because of the hugely liquid nature of cryptocurrencies, should Bitcoin be replaced, that may happen very fast.
Bitcoin is paying people to adopt it.  Seriously, my 80 year old aunt bought a bitcoin, then my 83 year old mother.  They just want something in the game.  And I just met a second cousin today on the phone, and ended up spending an hour talking about Bitcoin.  She too is in that age group, and not completely ignorant of it either.
None of these people are libertarians.

I know what you mean.  The rise of value in Bitcoin seems impossible... Yet forces are at work on the price that I believe will force the price upward even faster (as if 50x isn't vertical) at some point.  
I don't think the vertical rise will happen in 2014.   I'm guessing just an average sort of rise, assuming no event that drives a vertical rise.  But if we do see a driving event, we will look back at this post and laugh at how low MY guesses were.
What would a "driving event" look like?  Well one might be a financial crash of the dollar, yen, or Euro.  Or if in yet another country, banks start seizing funds from customers to bail themselves "in".  Or a serious crack down on off shore accounts by the USA and/or Europe.  Or a stock market crash.
Not all possible driving events have to be negative.  Amazon could start accepting Bitcoin.  Our Walmart.  Or a country drops their currency for Bitcoin.  Or an unassailable wall street firm starts a Bitcoin exchange.  Or a bank starts providing Bitcoin accounts.  Or some simple path to putting IRAs or 401ks into Bitcoin appears.

Transaction fees will get set by the market, and as you point out then ignore is that transactions will move off the blockchain if set to high.  The response to prices being too high isn't to raise them, but to increase volume by lowering them.
1 cent (per 2014 dollars) for most transactions will be the norm.  A rate that pays miners, and keeps the system going.  Of course, inflation might push the real value of a cent so low that we are talking about a dollar transaction fee (per 2020 dollars).

That's silly.  The more the flow can stay in Bitcoin, the more you reduce the costs of transactions.  And they are not one to one.  I can buy 10 Bitcoin with a bank, then make 200 transactions.

The reason Factom uses tokens (we call them Factoids) is to represent and exchange the rights to obligate the protocol to record an entry.   If you have a Factoid, you will be able to require the protocol to record your entries.  And some sort of limit is required if you are going to avoid a protocol filling with useless spam and DOS attacks.
Requiring users to have Factoids to use the protocol would force everybody to have to buy Factoids to use the protocol.  That might be a big win for us behind the protocol, but we don't want to force people to hold Factoids.
So how can we avoid a token, and still avoid spam and avoid requiring our users to have to buy our token?
**Of course, we could centralize Factom.**  That was my original design.  Then we could accept Bitcoin or even dollar payments, and place entries into Factom.  This would utterly destroy the protocol, because no matter what, people do not want a centralized system with centralized points of failure if the protocol is going to be central to their business.
**Or (being from Texas) we could do a "two step"**. We added to the Factoids the idea of Entry Credits.  We have a special transaction to convert Factoids into Entry Credits, and assign those Entry Credits to a specified public key.  These Entry Credits are non-transferable, and non-refundable.  Entry Credits are required to create chains and add entries to chains in Factom.  Entry Credits are only useful to create chains and add entries into Factom.  Oh, and to have a voice in managing the protocol.
Entry Credits provide nothing more than access to the protocol.  They cannot be traded.  They are clearly not an appcoin.
The Servers that collect and record entries are voted into the Federated Server pool by those people actually using the protocol (Have Entry Credits or have purchased entries).   These Federated Servers are paid in Factoids to run the protocol by the protocol.
Now here is where it all gets interesting.
**The servers in the Federated Server pool have Factoids, and users want to put entries into Factom**.  Yet for the most part users *don't want Factoids*.  They just want to *use the protocol*.  
**Users can buy Entry Credits with Bitcoin** from the Federated Servers.  Entry Credits assigned to the public keys provided by the Users.
Factoids get paid by the protocol to the Federated Servers, who then sell Entry Credits, effectively returning the Factoids to the protocol.  Now clearly such servers will want to take Bitcoin over other payments, but that will be up to the servers.  Furthermore, the Federated Servers might rather sell the Factoids to a store to handle sales and such.  The Federated servers can do so, because Factoids are just tokens.
Without Factoids, we can't set this up.  Bitcoin has to go to a specific address.  How do we create a protocol that distributes such payments without central control?  Without Factoids, we cannot reward servers for simply participating in the protocol. 
And without the Entry Credits, we cannot shield users from the underlying tokens.
**Factoids+Entry Credits both allow decentralization, and avoid users from having to mess with the appCoin.** So what we have done with Factom is our best effort to balance the need for a token to build a decentralized solution, with the need of our users to avoid any exposure to the underlying token.

Cash is crap without technology.  Actual physical cash is a tiny, tiny fraction of the money supply.  Such a small fraction that it is just silly to claim cash can exist without computers and networks.  
Someone can step in and mint coins and back paper.  But reinventing the 1800's won't happen for years and years.  Who is going to mint coins and back the paper while everything is burning down around our ears?
Gold reverts to its actual utility value as jewelry.  When 80 to 90 percent of the population is in the process of dying off (we can't produce food, can't transport food, and have no way to run a global economy) nobody cares much about jewelry.  What you are going to want is bullets, food, and water.  And you aren't going to trade any of that for gold.
Short of an actual loss of all technology, Bitcoin (and crypto currency technology) is a far, far better bet for supporting transactions at a wide range of economic standing world wide.  Absolutely right that someone earning a hand full of dollars a year isn't going to be using Bitcoin either.  But if they have a mobile phone, they can have a bitcoin account, and can transact with bitcoin.  Banks and credit cards are not going to reach out to that market, not when people earn thousands per year in the USA, and banks don't service them.

You have a fundamental miscalculation in your assessment of Bitcoin.
You note that $6B is about half the total number of $1 bills in circulation.  What you are talking about is a little bit of the M0+MB money supplies, which is only one slice (the least significant slice BTW) of the money supply.
The M0+MB money supplies play a nearly inconsequential role in setting prices (in the opinion of most economists, across most economic schools).   This is because most of the money in play in the economy, and thus setting prices, is found in the M2 money supply.  
Get a quick overview of [Money supplies here](
So you are trying to understand the value of Bitcoin as a currency as if it plays the same economic role in setting prices (i.e. its own value) as the little paper representations of dollars we print, carry in our pockets, and store in vaults.  Yet Bitcoin *is its own payment system*.  Thus there is no expansion of Bitcoin supply through payment processors, banks, and other financial institutions to create a separate (and far, far larger) "effective supply" of Bitcoin at the M2 level.
Why?  Because swapping promises (i.e. what M2 really does between parties) is slower, harder, more expensive, more centralized, and more insecure than actually transferring Bitcoin directly.  Thus transactions *actually involve real Bitcoin* when exchanging Bitcoin.  Most transactions with dollars *simply do not in any way involve actual dollars*.
Same for the M3 money supply.  If you want to save Bitcoin, you actually have to store them away.  In a fractional reserve banking system, only a fraction of the actual dollars are kept by the institutions holding these long term accounts.  Should every entity holding an account properly categorized as an M3 account ask to withdraw their funds (even over the course of years), we would see a total collapse of the system, or the totally precedented printing of money to comply. The latter solution would come complete with that "hyper inflation"  that most mainstream economists like to sneer about.
So any attempt to try and equate a payment system with little pieces of paper fundamentally misjudges the forces at play that drive up the price of Bitcoin.
That said, if there is any movement from the M3 money supply (long term savings) to reducing holdings of Bitcoin (or Dollars) in exchange for assets, goods, and services, then this will drive up inflation (i.e. lower the value of the currency and reduce the value of the currency).  We may be seeing some significant cashing out of Bitcoin right now.  Yet the pressure upward on the value of Bitcoin may resume, and quickly with the continued adoption.  One, because people are still underestimating the price pressure that Bitcoin adoption has on the price of Bitcoin, and Two, once the price begins rising again, more saving of Bitcoin will occur.
If any movement of the M3 money supply of dollars begins to flow into long term savings of Bitcoin, then the price pressure upward on Bitcoin could yield some rather amazing prices for Bitcoin. (10x - 50x the current price by the end of the year would not surprise me).

Just depends on if you read John Maynard Keynes or not.  If you do, and you but into his theories, the sustained inflation lowers wages.  This is for to the money illusion, where people confuse nominal wage increases with real wage increases.  
There is no need to go Austrian to make this argument.
Coupled with Baumol's cost disease (which illustrates the flaw in how we measure inflation) and we have a perfect storm for sustained losses in wages, and sustained growth in corporate profits for owners. 
Want to raise the minimum wage? You only need to stop inflation.  Done.
Keep in mind that banking and finance was 1 percent of the GDP in 1900.  Now it is over 8 percent.  If the current financial system was really an advantage to business, business would have gown faster, not slower, than the financial sector.

Bitcoin isn't a sterile algorithm.  It is a platform that separates spending (requiring private keys) from auditing (requiring the public keys and transaction ledger, along with signed proof of control of private keys).
We can trust organizations over time if we can audit them.  For the first time, audits can be public and verified.  And even maintained in real time.
Bitcoin then is honest.  Can't be counterfeited, or inflated, to the benefit of a few.  It is easier to transact directly, so no need to use a bank note.  
This is a live thing, this Bitcoin, spawning so many ideas!

What I question is why the author thinks being Property matters.
When you manufacture a product, your profit on the product is the cost of the raw materials and labor and other expenses required for manufacture, less what you sell it for.
But guess what.  Your costs for any particular product IS NEVER THE SAME.  People working on your product will have salaries that vary.  Maybe in the case of a car, a repair after manufacture is required.  And yes, Virginia, many of these costs are trackable on a per product basis, particularly for products as complex as cars.
The cost basis on a per product basis isn't the same from instance to instance of a product.  But the IRS doesn't care.
Furthermore, a Bitcoin is a Bitcoin.  You can swap one for another with yourself between accounts.  Since they are the same, it doesn't actually require a transaction to perform.  And we do this all the time, where property doesn't really carry an identity.  Like the products being sold off the shelf in a store.  If a hardware store had to distinguish between one set of nails and another, they couldn't just pour them into a bin for sale.  They would have to worry about which nails they sold.  
If an individual just decides on their own that the bitcoin at ADDR A has been swapped with a Bitcoin at ADDR B, then so be it.  This can be done without a blockchain transaction.  And that would not be a taxable event, because ownership of neither Bitcoin changed.  Just how the customer was thinking about them.
I doubt seriously the IRS would insist that Bitcoin be valued based on its Bitcoin address, and if they did the number of counter examples where the IRS does NOT make such determinations doom the IRS in court.

I think your term for miner vs hasher is reasonable, but is quite lacking in the Bitcoin documentation.  I think you have to get more documents updated with the terminology before you can expect people to use the terms this way.
Getting miners to include hashes for data is a tough way to do anything today, and as you get more miners to build blocks themselves, you will just make that process more and more difficult.  
OP_RETURN is predictable, while your suggestion of writing code for open source pooling software, getting acceptance, and getting it deployed, then competing with everyone that isn't running your software or disables your options....

* Customers (particularly when education is private)
Education is NOT universally managed in any one way.  You have private as well as public education, in our country and in many others.  And in none of these countries (and in fact, in history itself) will you find that the costs of education have gone down at the same pace as, say, the cost of bread.  Pick any product at all, and the prices of that product over time will go down relative to other goods and services to the degree that the product can utilize technology to eliminate labor and resources.

What you pretty much describe is an application of a Merkle Tree.  This is a way of creating proofs of documents in a list that just requires a set of hashes (not even the encrypted versions of the documents).
Because each hash handles a power of two, you get a power of two with each additional hash.  so one additional hash proves 2 documents (yours and another).  Two hashes prove Four documents.  Three proves eight, four proves sixteen, five proves 32, etc.

Merged mining info isn't included in every block.  They don't have to be antisocial to not include a hash, but the result is the same as blocking an OP_RETURN.  


That is what I would think too.  So Factom would have to recruit nearly every miner to hope that all its hashes (one every 10 minutes) are included... And while a block might hold several OP_RETURN transactions (to make up for miners that don't include them), I am not sure what Factom can do to get multiple hashes recorded in a block...  I guess Factom could combine the last 10 hashes every time, so that as long as 10 percent of them are recorded, you still have hashes securing all the entries...  Or even the last 100, so you only need 1 percent...
Of course, that works for OP_RETURN as well.

I think it wastes less per transaction than current systems.
2. Regular people are not sophisticated enough to use local wallets, so they use online wallets, which cause them to have their money stolen.
Matter of development.  And that is happening.
3. It takes too much storage space and bandwidth, again, encouraging online wallets
Spv.... Not true.
4. Having all transactions recorded in every node actually means that Bitcoin is not scalable. For n users to each have m transactions it requires n^2 m storage.
More storage is required one many thousands of of systems in the current financial system 
5. Bitcoin could seriously be taken down by a major government if they really wanted to, they just need to control majority of hashing power for a short period of time. CIA could easily start a number of mining pools and accomplish this. For all we know they already have!
Mostly fud.  And doing so would be illegal and hard to hide.
6. Threat of malware stealing all your money
Matter of development.
7. Transactions take too long to confirm for Bitcoin to be practical in most instances
Not true.
8. Speculation has made value too volatile to be used as store of value.
Yeah but we use the dollar anyway.
9. Irreversibility is great for sellers but terrible for buyers, limiting consumer adoption.
10. Since shared ledger is based in collective agreement, future disputes could lead to Bitcoin fracturing into multiple currencies.

All this does is underscore that paper dollars are safer for the purchase of illegal goods, and that paper dollars are easier for money laundering because they do not leave a paper trail.

The U.N. estimates a drug market in the US at  [+300 Billion dollars per year in 2003](  The DOJ brags they intercept about 1.5 billion (some of that actually being drug money, and quite a bit is simply from people in the presence of a drug operation, or just caught on the streets with large cash amounts).
1.5 billion out of 300 billion isn't even a credit card fee.

If the colored coin you create does not represent some limited asset, then what is the point?  If you create more colored coin than you have assets, then why bother?
Any colored coin you create must be limited (as Bitcoin itself is limited) otherwise it is worthless.
And one of the criticisms of Colored Coins is that they are tied to a particular amount of Bitcoin.  If Bitcoin goes up in value too much, then the Bitcoin might be worth more than the asset you are representing with your colored coins...
And BTW, this argument has nothing to do with Daniel's point.  This is simply an argument about the best way to leverage Bitcoin to trade assets and implement smart contracts.  You could be right, that colored coins is a better way.  None the less, Mastercoin is just a different way to do the same thing colored coins do.  There is no altcoin here.

No.  The consensus algorithm rotates the responsibility for managing a chain over the Federated Servers.  So for a minute, one server is in control of your chain **{** (and a bunch of other chains, as the responsibility of all chains are spread over all the Federated Servers.) **} Edited ... language was all wrong**
The next minute, another server is in control, (because responsibility for particular chains moves to other servers every minute) and so forth.
The Federated Servers are elected by the users.  They vote with their Entry Credits and the Entry Credits they have used.  So the actual users are the ones responsible for who runs the Federated Servers.  So basically, Factom uses something like mining pools, only they are part of the protocol.
@_date: 2015-01-18 06:30:50
The demo (shows how the api works) did a bit more.  It created a Factom chain.  Then it created an entry for each book that included the title, author, and the hash of the actual book.  It added the entry to the Factom chain.
Now there is a chain in Factom with 29k entries for each book.  Each entry is provable via a Merkel proof to one of the three anchors in Bitcoin.
So it is a set of hashes, ~29k of them, not a single hash.  All secured by three transactions in Bitcoin.
Demonstrates creating a list, adding piles of entries,  all using the released API.  More useful apps are possible, but this one is simple, and provides a bit of a stress test.

Running on centralized servers.

We maintain code for everyone.  Those investing in our project are banking on the value of the protocol.  Anyone at all can invest; we are not closed to a select set of investors.

OT is a great product.  Monetas is a great company.  There are trade offs for all decisions.  Generally it amounts to tokens vs central control.
Factom allows users to pay Bitcoin to access the protocol and never touch our token.  In fact, a user can pay dollars and never touch any cryptocurrency at all.
The design uses the token for what it must, and nobody not directly involved in running the protocol need touch the token at all.  In fact, in theory, the protocol could run and never ever log a person to person transaction of the token.
I'd love to discuss your ideas on how the protocol could run, be secure, be decentralized, and not use a token.

Like any project, some people either support the project, or it dies.
You have to pick your devil.  You can use a token to decentralized the protocol, or you can have a centralized solution and trust they will do the right thing.
You work on a centralized product.  You can avoid your own token.  We don't want to be centralized.  We need a token.

Factom isolates the users from crypto currency.  Since it's entry credits assigned to a public key cannot be transferred or refunded, this reduces the risk of deploying the private key.  If the key is compromised, it can't be sold.  Only used to write entries.

I would like to say that Moe is doing the best he can here, and is doing a great job at what anyone running one of these conferences should do: create an open platform for discussion of topics and cross pollination of ideas.  That is the positive side, but it also includes education about questionable players.
Nobody running a conference wants to accept a sponsor, only to have said sponsor fall into controversy. But of course, they have little control over that.  And nobody wants to stand in judgment over their sponsors after the fact.
Absent actual charges, I think focusing on the TNABC is counter productive.  A platform should be inclusive if at all possible.  The decision to exclude voices should if possible be the individual's, by skipping the talks they do not wish to hear, not the organizer's.

For an organization to support a 5 billion dollar ecosystem with just a spend of 546K... That is amazing!   
Maybe there is plenty of issues to take the Bitcoin Foundation to task over, but paying very good developers reasonable salaries reflecting their experience and ability isn't one of them.
Certainly a decentralized organization would be better.  But the result of such an organization *should be higher salaries than you get in industry*.  After all, the gain is the removal of organization overhead.  Pay based on merit.  Control over your compensation.
Right now, Bitcoin's value of 5,000 million to the support for Bitcoin development of .5 million ... that's a 10,000 to 1 ratio!  Now certainly Bitcoin itself has many other spends with miners, the many conferences, the educational efforts, meetup groups around the world, etc.   Even the many core devs that support themselves and donate their time and effort!  
My only point is that this small sum is being HIGHLY leveraged to bring huge value to the community.

Great point.  We will have a working protocol before distributing the tokens.


Absolutely agree that if you have a running protocol (like Bitcoin) you have all these opportunities.  But the protocol itself requires incentives to insure that people are willing to work to keep the system up, and have some way to profit.  Mining companies, mining pools, merchant services, exchanges, and more all exist directly or indirectly because of mining rewards and transaction fees.
Our protocol is no different.


Bitcoin has to be sent somewhere.  Who gets it?  How does the person paying know who is supposed to get it?  And if every entry in Factom requires a Bitcoin transaction (280 bytes or larger) how is Factom reducing bloat?
When you pay a transaction fee in Bitcoin, you do not specify who gets it.  But the miner who ultimately mines the block (not necessarily the first miner who mines a block) gets that fee.  How do I do that with Bitcoin for my system?  If I want a system that distributes funds through the protocol without the user specifying the recipient, I can't do that with Bitcoin.




To put an entry into Factom, you take a Factoid and convert it to Entry Credits tied to a public address.  The ECs are nontransferable, and can only be used to put entries into Factom.  
So a Factom user can use money to buy Entry Credits from someone that has Factoids (our token).  Someone like the Federated Servers who are being paid Factom Tokens by the protocol.
Now the Factom user can use their ECs to build chains and place entries.  Reading the data is free.  They are done, and they never had a wallet, and they never had to have a cryptocurrency.  They could have paid with a Credit Card after all.  And Entry Credits are not cryptocurrencies, because you can't exchange them.




You absolutely could have an account.  But if you have a distributed protocol, who holds the account?  How can one server sell the right to put an entry credit into Factom and obligate another to spend time and energy to make good?
Furthermore, what gives the Factom Servers the right to sell entries?  Anyone could sell entries if they wanted to, unless there was some way to distribute the right to sell entries.  Someway we could measure their contribution to the system that they could in turn use to show they had the right to sell the entry.
Something like a token.

Computers, education, transportation,  medicine .... all have different price swings over time.  And the value of the dollar is defined by what you can buy with it.  
If you need to buy food, then why you can't afford food does you no good.
If you hold bitcoin steady, or food steady, or gold stready, or transportation costs steady, or the cost of a gig of storage steady, and graph the dollar's value, it is going to look really volatile.  
On the other hand, monetary policy is a constant force on the prices of all goods.  Why do we then average price changes to estimate monetary policy's impact on prices?

It would be for the USA.  Bitcoin has been declared to be legal and to be property.  The government cannot destroy property of USA citizens without due process.  And any country that seeks to destroy the property of US citizens is commuting an act of terrorism if not war.


A wallet can use SPV.  You don't have to run a full node for a mobile wallet.


Trusted computing hardware is cheap.  Multisig allows for using a vender to provide multi factor authentication for payments.  New protocols running on Bitcoin like MSC even provide for reversible payments.
"Pull" payment systems like checks, credit cards, and bank wires **cannot** be secured.  That's why we all pay for fraud as a built in cost of every transaction in the current financial system.  
Bitcoin is a "push" payment system.  Every valid payment must be digitally signed to be valid.  And the signature is validated by a script, allowing for all sorts of flexibility.  It can be secured.  And it can be insured properly too (as any property which can be secure can also be cost effectively insured by a part willing to district the (reduced) risk).
All this stuff is coming into the market.

Totally agree


About a 1/10 to 1/100 of a Bitcoin Transaction fee.  
The "trusted entities" are the Federated Servers which are servers that have the most support from the users of the protocol.  Factom is a Delegated Proof of Stake sort of system, only the "Stake" are those using the protocol (i.e. controlling Entry Credits, not Factoids).
**I am going to fix energy to entry below... hard to read otherwise**


Airline miles can be sold or contributed to other parties.  More like a Software license.


Actually, I think you only hold Entry Credits if you want to use them.  They are a software license.  If you don't want to use the software, you wouldn't buy a software license, and likewise if you don't want to use Factom, you wouldn't buy Entry Credits.


This is one of the selling points of Factom.  You can use the protocol without touching a token that is worth stealing.  So even if your app is compromised, you will not lose much in the way of value, and there is very little reason to try and steal entry credits.


More likely, Entry Credits will be fixed on the value in Dollars.  After all, the Federated Servers need to make the protocol as valuable as possible;  that means maintaining a constant cost level with clients that for the foreseeable future will price their costs in Dollars.
That said, you have it more or less right.


Pretty close.

I think I said all mechanisms for raising money can be scammed.  But by choosing a non profit for our organization, selling equity isn't an option.  Besides, like Bitcoin has no "CEO", there will never be a "CEO of Factom".    There is no decentralized way to support a traditional company.
All of this constrains how funds can be raised.  And there is no magic method of raising funds that cannot be scammed.  But there are honest ways to use any fund raising mechanism.

Not at all.


It can be when, like I said, you do not respond to replies, nor take the time to understand the constraints of a project, and the solutions they use to address those constraints.


Actually, Factom's tokens are not "guaranteed to be worthless".  Quite the opposite.  The tokens will reflect the value of the Factom Protocol.  Conclusions without analysis, i.e. statements like "Selling a token that will be guaranteed to be worthless is a scam.", that is trolling.


The fact that Factom's tokens will not have a fixed value is not the same as saying that they are backed by nothing;  the tokens are backed by the value of the protocol.
Bitcoin doesn't have a stable value, nor is it backed by anything.  But I doubt you would say it is a scam.


We have a white paper and consensus paper that goes into great depth into the design, and how it works.  If you could point to actual alternatives to our design decisions...
Oh wait.  You decided that being decentralized isn't a good enough decision.  That having a mechanism to choke down span isn't important.  You just know (somehow) that the only reason we have a token is to scam....

David is a big believer in Bitcoin, and in decentralized applications.  He has invested his own money and effort in all of these projects.  Maidsafe, Storj, Ethereum, La'Zooz ... these are all very ambitious projects seeking to solve very fundamental problems.   
As is Factom.
The claim that David is a con artist is laughable.   David is a good and honest person, as anyone who knows him can attest.   That said, he has chosen to dive into some of the most ambitious and crypto centric projects in the space.  His investment and promotion of those projects may open him up to criticism should any of them fail, as most startups do.  This is not in any way proof of an individual being "a straight out con artist."
The reader will have to decide if insults and conclusions lacking any analysis as you have presented are worth while, or if a reasoned discussion of what little one can identify as a concern in your writings carries more weight.
I hope you can actually learn enough about Factom to make specific observations and propose specific alternatives to our design.  It would make a much more enlightening conversation, and would be of much greater value to the reader.

A centralized solution would work very easily in this fashion.  But the problem with Bitcoin as a payment for this application is that we are trying to avoid a Bitcoin transaction at all.
We could do the separate Entry Credit scheme that we are planning now.  Then what happens is the Bitcoin purchase sets up an Entry Credit account for a user.  This way they could buy say 100 entries in Factom with only a single transaction in Bitcoin.  But here the problem is, who do you pay?  Someone has to hold a Bitcoin wallet.
So if we want this system to be decentralized, then we have to define who is doing the work to support the protocol.  And those people doing that work then have the right to sell access in the form of a Entry Credit.  The accounting then needs its own representation of this right to sell access.
But what if the person that wants to sell access isn't one of the servers doing the work?  And what if the servers doing the work need other forms of money to pay rent, employees, and coffee?  What if they can sell the right to obligate the protocol to someone else?
What we now have is a three token system.  Bitcoin providing security, Factoids providing the right to obligate the protocol, and Entry Credits the literal right to place data into the Factom protocol.


Don't feel sorry at all.  Look, I am one of the biggest "App Coin" skeptics out there.  I spent weeks trying to program this system away from any kind of token.  But the goal of decentralizing Factom drove us to a token.  Still, if you look at our design closely (we do have the white paper and consensus algorithm out there to be studied), there is nearly no way to avoid a token.
As a means of raising money, the token is VERY limiting.  Most of the money out there wants to invest in a traditional, for profit, C Corporation.  A traditional company can do many rounds of investment.  Eventually you can sell your company and cash out.  
By going with a token sale, and a non-profit, we are setting up an organization that is suited to maintain the protocol and pay a few developers for as long as the protocol is useful.  While I do believe we will make good money for having done this, the token sale will not result in vast wealth.  At least not without a huge amount of effort.
I hope this helps.

I view an App Coin to be a token within a system that allows for the control of, access to, or permissions for various features, things, and activities.  If the implementation is digital, you get something like Namecoin, Bitcoin, Factoids, etc.  But the nature of the token doesn't change anything.  
What, you think an App Coin made of wood is magically different from a digital App Coin? 
How Interesting.  Why do you think that?


Factoids are redeemable for Entry Credits which you must have to create your chains, and write your entries to those chains.


Sorry, I heard about the debate, but never listened to it.  I'll try and listen to it sometime.  But even if David objectively lost that debate (which I am not sure he did, from what I hear), a debate result isn't proof or evidence, and doesn't substitute for logic and analysis.  If the content of that debate gives you significant insights into the nature of App Coins, then brillant!  Shine some of that insight on what we are talking about!
On a side note, we have had invitations out to talk to Daniel about our architecture for months.  I would absolutely love to gather around a white board and figure out a decentralized design that works without a Factoid but none the less incentivizes everyone to pull in the same direction to make the Factom Protocol a reality.  To date that hasn't happened.


Hey, I am laying out my thought process here for you.  If I have missed some obvious solution to the design problems we are working against, I would love for you to point it out.  We *have spent a good bit of time* thinking about how we architect this protocol, and how to fairly launch the protocol, and how to fund the development of something that is completely decentralized and independent of us.  
Obviously we could be centralized.  Send money to us if you want to put data into the protocol, dictate who can run a server, etc.  And because we would be centralized, we could raise money by selling equity.  We could have traditional investors and go the well wore route pioneered by corporations for hundreds of years.  
But we didn't want centralization.  We wanted it all decentralized, just like Bitcoin.  So help us out.  Tell us idiots what we are missing.

Factoids have many disadvantages as money or currency.  Network effect is the biggest one, which is why Factom is designed to work well with Bitcoin.
Will Factoids have value?  Certainly, but only if the protocol has value.  Just like a Chunky Cheese token has value if that is what you need to play a game in their arcade.

You always have speculators.  And if there is a strong demand to write entries into Factom, there is a built in demand for the token.  But it doesn't really have to develop into a currency, because you can simply have the speculators and the servers and the users.  And if the users are significant enough, then you will have a certain base value.

You can't have infinite velocity in Factom.  Entry Credits are not recycled.


Well, if you are using them to supply your access, you need a supply.  Or to sell, you need a supply on hand.

Straw man?   I am not setting up an argument for you, then knocking it down.  I am defining my position and views.  
The line: "I know you don't like the token, you prefer the normal corporate structures, centralized control, and thus placing applications like this potentially in control of regulators. All so companies can insist on taking Bitcoin as payment." is some sarcasm, but it does reflect in my mind what centralization leads to.
Now you have repeatedly said I am scamming people... I have to assume this is because you think more typical fund raising mechanisms are more honest.  If I think they are not, then clearly you must think evil things because I am "sure" that you must, otherwise you would agree with me... right?

The goals are to create a *Data Layer* (1) secured by Bitcoin, (2) lift non-transactions out of the Blockchain, and (3) lower the costs to secure data.
Sidechains move Bitcoin value from the Bitcoin blockchain to other blockchains and back.  So they would make an excellent means of defining what value is, with Bitcoin as the measure.  Unfortunately, a sidechain cannot be made that pays servers for supporting a protocol.  Bitcoin has this same need, to pay the miners that validate transactions and stamp blocks with POW.  Bitcoin does this both by rewarding transaction fees and block rewards *through the protocol itself*.  
Bitcoin uses no trusted party to make these payments to miners.  Bitcoin would not exist as a protocol without this distributed, autonomous reward system paid to the parties that implement the protocol.
We need to do the same thing.  Make payments to the Factom Servers through the protocol, with no trusted party issuing these payments.
So while sidechains is perhaps the best mechanism for ensuring that Bitcoin is the currency used to define value in this space, the Factoids we are creating are the means of defining value within the Factom protocol.
@_date: 2015-03-19 19:49:06
So focus on:




Like I said earlier, the Factoid to Entry Credit conversion rate will be set to maintain what is roughly .1 cents per entry.  This is my expectation.  
Some factors:
1. Federated Servers are paid a fixed number of Factoids.
2. The only way an FS gets more value is to increase the value of Factoids
3. The exchange rate of Factoids to Entry Credits will be set to maximize the number of Factoids leaving the market.  
4. The users of Factom are isolated from the Factoid price.  So the assumption is that the largest users of Factom will just buy Entry Credits for what is viewed as a market stable price.
5.  If 4. holds, then if Factoid prices crash, then use of the protocol will sweep the excess Factoids from the market.
6.  If 4. holds and Factoid prices rise, the supply of Factoids will grow because the flow of Factoids out of the market will fall.
Setting the Factoid to Entry Credit Rate
Increasing the price of Entry Credits will move more Factoids out of the market per entry written.  But it may also reduce the volume of entries.  So an FS is highly incentivized to find the sweet spot for the exchange rate.  I am guessing it is at .1 cents per entry, but that is just my guess.




You will buy Entry Credits like you buy gas for your car.  Often enough that you have the supply you need, but rarely enough that you are not overly bothered by the task.






You are not missing something, and yes, the payment of Factoids per server is fixed.
Fixed based on how much they contribute? Fixed based on how many entry credits each gives access to? This is the missing piece.
It is fixed for the servers as a group.  The distribution of that fixed amount could vary based on support (servers with greater support earn more than other servers) but that is still under discussion.
@_date: 2015-03-21 02:52:00
Isn't that the problem in all markets?  If you knew what the demand is going to be, investing would be simple.
If factoids have a market, it makes sense to buy to supply the next guy at a profit.  But if there is no demand, you will lose your investment.  To complicate this further, you are competing with other potential suppliers....

And as I pointed out, the question is bogus.  It isn't what one would prefer to own.  It is what one would prefer to give.  The choice of what you get to own is made by the giver, not the recipient of a gift card.
Unless, as David points out, you get  a discount with the card.  Gyft gives you 3 percent when purchased by Bitcoin I think. Or if you just want to use Gyft cards to effectively buy stuff with Bitcoin. But the point remains there are a tiny few reasons to buy Gift cards for yourself.
And you can act like this proves something about tokens in distributed autonomous applications all you want, but I don't see what possible point was being made, and how this proves David is "completely dishonest".
A proper distributed autonomous application minimizes the role of a token to solve the problems that cannot be solved another way.  In particular tokens are needed to give rights to parties to do something with the app in exchange to supporting the app.  
In our case, Factoids give one the right to sell Entry Credits.  Where do those rights come from?  Over time, they come from those that run the servers.  Initially they also come from those that developed the protocol, or funded the launch and maintenance of the protocol.  Either way, there is no free ride.  People contribute programming, or financial support, or the running of the Factom servers. And if anyone does,  one can buy or earn Factoids, and thus they get the right to sell entry credits.
Hopefully people who set up such markets will sell entry credits for Bitcoin.
It really is that simple.
@_date: 2015-03-19 01:42:32
The short answer is that the Factoid to Entry Credit conversion rate is established by the Federated Servers.  The expectation is that the conversion rate will track a real world cost of 1/10 a cent per entry.  But once this is decentralized, the conversion rate is under distributed control.
You can read the [Consensus Algorithm]( which details the mechanics.
I am working on an Factom Economic Model paper that will go into more detail.  But that paper isn't done yet.
What Entry Credits Get You
Once you have Entry Credits assigned to a public key, the private key can be used to sign Entry Commits and Chain Create Commits. 
That let's you reveal your Entries and Chains, and the protocol must record your data.  All nodes audit the protocol, and failures to record will result in loss of support for the offending Federated Server(s). 
@_date: 2015-03-20 16:53:36


No, having purchased Entry Credits gives you a voice.  Doesn't matter if you have used them or not.  The weight of that purchase fades over 6 months.  So those that use the protocol, and have used it recently, they have the most say.


There is no cap on the Factoids sold initially.  But whatever that number is, it is used to set the fixed inflation number from that point forward.

 How is "Centralized" a misnomer?  You either 1) have centralized control, or 2) decentralized control.  That's kinda what the word means.
I never said you cannot have a centralized system that runs in a trustless manner.  But centralized systems (even trustless ones) can censor.  And they can be targeted and taken down (as they are centralized).  Part of Factom's design is to be censor resistant, and (being decentralized) redundant.   Being decentralized and completely open source helps those goals.
You can certainly build centralized systems that operate in a (more or less) trustless manner.  Prevention of censorship and risking single points of failure remains a problem in centralized systems, even if operating in a trustless fashion.


Absolutely you can sell magic beans without tokens.  They are called "securities".  One man's bean is another man's stock, is another man's token, is another man's loan.

Not actually discussing what you consider a bad idea so that readers can be educated about the pros and cons of an idea is actually trolling.
For example, your insistence that selling a token is fundamentally a bad idea.  I do agree that selling only a token is a bad idea.  Backing that token with an application that provides real value and real benefit to users is not necessarily a bad idea.
Now I will give you "not necessarily".  We can't possibly predict how our protocol will perform in the real world, but we can do everything within our power to make the protocol useful, to perform exactly as documented.   And we can talk to people in the real world grappling with real problems about whether or not our solution solves their problems.
We have done all of this.  You do not seem interested in discussing the nature of the problem we are solving.  Nor looking at how the protocol will benefit users.  Nor are you interested in discussing the nature of the token generation, flow, and use.  
You don't even seem to care that people can use Factom with only Bitcoin and never touch one of our tokens.

The main twists we are adding to the model is pretty simple to understand:
* We don't get any of the token sale without a working protocol.  Using Koinify for that.
* We already have real world people working to use Factom to solve real world problems.
* We are engaged in total transparency on our development and our funding.  
In the end the protocol may fail, and the token may be worthless.  Most attempts like this do fail.  However, it won't be because we were not attempting to do real things in the real world to solve real problems with a protocol that people can really use.  Really.
I can accept that we might fail, but I will refute that what we are doing is some kind of scam.

No, there are too many people holding Factoids, and the holders of Factoids are largely speculators.
The Entry Credits on the other hand, these are non transferable good only for using the protocol.  And there are way fewer of them.  And they represent users of the protocol.


I don't understand that sentence.  What exactly are you concerned about?
@_date: 2015-03-17 01:47:45




Actually, Factom has a very strict definition for what is published.  Published means that an anchor to the majority signed directory block has been written into the Bitcoin Blockchain.   The address that writes this anchor is actually deterministically determined (i.e. belongs to one of the Federated Servers, which has been deterministically selected to write the anchor).
A failure to follow the protocol is immediately detectable by nodes listening to the Bitcoin node network, and the Factom node network.  
Remember... Your own algorithm assumes that you can create a known chain of entries in Bitcoin.  There isn't any reason Factom cannot create a know chain of entries in Bitcoin.


You can't have two majority signed directory blocks with two anchors written to Bitcoin without everyone knowing.  At this point the protocol is completely broken, and the protocol stalls.




Flood filled networks do not replace proof of work, reliable or not.  Because once time has passed, there is no proof the data one node holds is the same as what another should be holding.
Securing a flood filled network requires identities that age over time.  Something Factom can provide.




The process "not yet complete" that I was referring to was your review of the protocol.  We have made a payment to you, but have not had the benefit of your analysis.  
In fact, we have contracted with Konify so that the money from the token sale is not available to us until the protocol is working and usable.  But I do appreciate your concern that we are still working on Factom.  I believe we will be working on Factom for years. Just because we get Factom up and running doesn't mean it can't be better.  Which is why we are having the crowd sale, to pay for that.

I spent three months working to create this without a token.  So your silly idea that a guy with 30+ years of development experience was fooled by a 29 year old business guy's claim about what can or can't be done in a software protocol is, frankly, laughable. 


The right to obligate the Factom protocol.  So if you are a store, and you want to sell access to Factom using Bitcoin, you have to be able to obligate the Factom protocol. It works like this:
1. You acquire Factoids (you are a federated server, or you buy them)
2. You sell the Entry Credits at their market price with a mark up, so maybe .0105 cents per entry credit rather than .01 per entry credit. You have the customer give you their public key along with their Bitcoin.  Of course, volume deals may apply, so you can make this appealing to large customers.
3. You convert the appropriate Factom to Entry Credits and have them assigned to the public key of your customer.
4. They use their entry credits up, writing their data, signing it with their key.

That's silly.  Perhaps the problem here isn't so much that there isn't an answer, but David didn't know how to address the issue.  It is actually very, very easy:
People use gift cards all the time, rather than cash.  The preference of an individual for a particular use case has no bearing on anything.  
Gift cards are purchased for a reason, and the **guy that gets the gift card has no say.** He doesn't buy the card, so it doesn't matter one iota that the guy getting the card would prefer cash. 
So the REAL question is why would one BUY a gift card?  Well, there are tons of reasons, but one close to my heart is as follows:  if I want to send money to my college student so they can get food, but can't waste it on video games or partying, then a Gift card might be totally useful.
Do I want to buy a gift card for myself?  No.  But that isn't the use case, is it?
I would point out I don't always want Bitcoin either.  If I want to play Chuck E Cheese games, I need a Chuck E Cheese token, not a Bitcoin token.   Duh.  We live in a world where we use tokens ALL THE TIME.  
The question to you remains, why in the world do you think there is no need for tokens for blockchain based applications?
The whole point of token based applications and protocols is that you want the token if you have a use case.  If you don't have a use case, then you don't need the token.  If an application or protocol is hugely compelling, then the token rewards people for participating.  If it doesn't increase the rewards for participating, then your protocol doesn't scale.




Well, I can tell that you have issues with the model.  But none of your logic holds water.


None of Peter Todd's complaints have anything to do with the token.  His solution lacks most of the attributes Factom has that is making so many groups come on board.  In fact, his comment about complexity was a throwaway comment about what Vitalik said.  Funny.  Ethereum claiming Factom is complex.  Heh.




You.  Can't.  Have.  Investors.  In. A. Non Profit.
And why is Factom a non Profit?  Outside of getting some tokens, there is no way to monetize a distributed autonomous application.  You can build on the protocol, and build a traditional business (BitPay and hundreds of other companies are doing that on Bitcoin) or by participating in the protocol (Bitcoin miners). But the actual protocol doesn't provide a traditional monetization point.
Why?  Because there is no centralized point of control where you can set up a toll booth.


Yeah, that's easy for someone to say that hasn't spent any time at all looking at the whitepaper or the consensus algorithm.  You have not brought up any design decision that we have made, or even a funding issue beyond claiming it won't work.  You have yet to demonstrate that your accusations hold water.
Heck, I even pointed out how the system works *against anyone* trying to pump and dump.  It is built into the protocol, *because* we want the token to be valued by the protocol.
@_date: 2015-03-18 04:07:15


The reason Factoids will have value is that they are needed to access the protocol.  If the protocol has no value, the tokens will have no value.  If the protocol has value, the tokens will have value.  
If the project is worthwhile, then the tokens will have value, and the sale will not be a scam.  If the project isn't worthwhile, or if it doesn't really exist or have a purpose, and those developing it will be involved in a scam.
You leap to a conclusion without any evidence or logic to back it up.  In fact, you admit to a usefulness of the project, but still claim the project is a scam.  
We are not religious here.  We need you to spell out how a project can be useful, designed to use a token, yet the token will be worthless and a scam.  How does that work?
@_date: 2015-03-18 04:43:43
Proof of burn has no meaning with Factom.
The reason you use proof of burn is to move value one way from Bitcoin to some other chain.  While that is interesting in some cases, Factom's tokens do not have value because they originated somewhere like Bitcoin.  They will have value because they are useful to gain access to the Factom protocol.
I think you might make the argument that we should not have ANY distribution at all.  Then the first payment to the servers would have to provide for everyone using the protocol at the beginning, and continue forward.  This is what Bitcoin did.
However, this would even be worse in some ways. We as the ones putting the system together could grab a MUCH larger percentage of the Factoids early on.  And with the projects we have lined up, those Factoids would have a very high price.  And really the distribution wouldn't change at all.  We would have most of the tokens, and perhaps by dominating the Federated Servers, we might be able to defend our percentage.
With the initial distribution, we level the playing field, and we put some value to the side to support the development of the protocol.  I know that you might not think it is in the best interest of everyone to have resources to continue to work on Factom, but it is our opinion that this is in fact a good idea.

That's a good idea.
Of course, out of the box we can use Bitcoin to prove what was donated, and the list of Bitcoin addresses of the charities to document the Bitcoin went to the proper parties.
Factom can document the conversions of Doge to Bitcoin, and the distribution of said Bitcoin.  Here is where the ability to create an oracle (that gives the Doge to Bitcoin conversion rate) would be useful.  Factom can document who performs the conversion and when to how much bitcoin.  Anyone can then look at the historical price of Doge and determine if the distribution of Doge was honest.
I'll go to the team today and see if we can't do this as a demo.  We are heads down building out the protocol, but we build demos all the time as part of our validation and testing process.

The exchange rate of factoids to entry credits is set by the federated servers.  So if the price of factoids in the market goes down, the number of entry credits you can buy for a factoid will go down.  That means more factoids will leave the market in the form of entry credits. If the price rises for factoids, a factoid will get users more entry credits.  All because the market price of entry credits can be made stable, no matter the price of factoids.
This means Factom will adjust factoid supplies to any amount of holding of factoids, from zero holding to 99.999% holding.  And the value of factoids will adjust to the point that it  reflects the real value of the protocol in the market.
The factoid serves a defined and necessary function in the protocol.  It prices the value of the work done by the Factom servers.  And the architecture protects the users of the protocol from any speculation that may occur with the factoids.  And the architecture assures that the operation of the protocol works against anyone that may try to manipulate the factoid price.
@_date: 2015-03-17 15:56:01
Exactly.  And if the protocol is a vast success, then yes, we will have done pretty well.  The crowd sale will account for 50% of the initial tokens, 30% to developers and everyone else helping with the organization, and 20% to the people that pre-purchased tokens which has been used to fund our work.
Let's say that we sell 100 tokens (to make the math simple).  Then 20 tokens every year will be paid to the servers that run the protocol.  In five years, the servers will have distributed as many tokens as the initial token issue (i.e. 20 per year x 5 years = 100).  75 percent of the tokens will be from servers running the protocol, or the open sale of tokens in the token sale.  Only 25 percent at that point will be held by those who purchased in the private round and those that contributed to Factom prior to the open token sale. 
We are not setting up Factom.org to have a vast controlling number of tokens in the system.  
@_date: 2015-03-11 15:40:05
An [Initial Public Offering]( has a certain definition which a token sale simply doesn't fit.  An IPO is an issuing of securities (common or preferred) that are equity based.  Centralized companies can sell equity. Decentralized protocols cannot.
By selling a token that grants use of the protocol to the holders of the token, we are quite literally selling access to the protocol, and nothing else.
If you are building a decentralized protocol outside of the control of any centralized party, then the use of a token is impossible to avoid.  Some protocols can in fact use Bitcoin.  However this requires the protocol to be able to identify a real time Bitcoin exchange that requires nothing more than what Bitcoin already does.  In the case of Factom, this isn't the cases; we need a token customized to the protocol.
Of course, it might be possible to start up a decentralized protocol without a token sale, in the way Bitcoin did.  But of course, one might argue that those that mined Bitcoin in the early days have been handsomely rewarded for being early adopters, and that amounted to a "sweat" purchase rewarded in tokens over the first couple of years.
I hope this helps.   
@_date: 2015-03-16 21:25:22


Is there any mechanism creating increased demand for it as the project takes hold and people utilize the technology?
The factoids are the tradable tokens.  Outside the token sale, the only source going forward will be tokens generated and paid to the Factom servers running the protocol.
Factoids are converted to entry credits.  The are tied to an address, and are not transferable.  This allows applications use Factom with their entry credits and never touch a factoid.  This process removed factoids from the market.
The flow into the economy with payments to servers, and out of factoids to create entry credits, this will balance.  We expect to see a trend towards a factoid that reflects the value of the protocol.

Actually I have built a model and played with various scenarios.  It is way too awkward and complicated to make public, but if you wanted to do a google hangout or something, I could walk you through it.
Mostly what comes out is that all the unknowns wash out, and the Factoids get priced by the value of the protocol + level of speculation.
But even if speculation goes to zero, or makes up 99.99 percent of the value, the protocol levels the value of the Factoids out.  Shocks get dampened.
And there is a huge network effect.  Factom becomes a standard, and everyone putting data into Factom now generates a data source on which other business processes can leverage.  Factom can become a basis for tracking identification, documenting creative processes, determining payments for resource usage, and more.  Much of its true potential is the interaction between unexpected parties.
The price is being set by 32 Federated Servers.  These servers can be voted in and out by the users of the protocol.  So decisions that are bad for the protocol are bad for the servers (it reduces the value of their fixed income).  Representing the body of their active users is what gets them support.
So it isn't central planning, the incentives are aligned.
Lastly, if the pre-sale was too big (say 100 million dollars) we would have a really hard time justifying that spend in Factom within a year or two.  That would be a huge problem.
We are not going to get a sale of that size.
If we got a sale somewhere in the order of 15 to 30 million, we could justify that within the first couple of years.  But more than that might... I will repeat... might be a problem.  It is really, really hard to estimate the potential of this project.
@_date: 2015-03-12 00:00:40
I certainly expect Factom to be cloned.  It is all open source, with no ties to the source code.
What we expect is to build network effect based, not on value (Bitcoin's network effect is built on value), but on data.  The simple recording of information that can GUIDE the movement of value rather than compete with value.
In fact, Factom is created so that those recording data need never use or own a Factoid (our token).  People can pay with Bitcoin to use Factom, and record data in Factom, and still the protocol remains distributed and autonomous.
The goal isn't to compete with Bitcoin at all.  Just provide a protocol to record data without bloating the Bitcoin blockchain, yet be secured by the Bitcoin blockchain, thus increasing the value of the blockchain to the economy.

Satoshi is quite simply an unexpected spice to the tech!  George read through the whole body of comments and communications exists from Satoshi, looking for some insight into Satoshi's thoughts.
George thought it would be great to mine these posts and organize them into an interview, and this is the result.
It isn't perfect, as someone noted, "I am not Satoshi Nakamoto" is five words, not four.   This is an early manuscript he rushed out the door for our Conference.   This is a wonderful thing for him to have done.

Factoids are created to pay the Factoid servers.  The exchange rate of Factoids to EntryCredits (what you need to write data into Factom) is set by the Federated Servers to remain stable in cost.  Say at  .1 cents USD per entry.  When Factoids are converted into EntryCredits, the Factoids never come back.  So if the value of Factoids goes too low, the number of Factoids needed to write entries goes up, and the supply of Factoids goes down.  The opposite is also true.  If Factoids are priced too high, inflation of Factoids goes up.
So the value of Factoids will reflect the usefulness of the protocol.  
So how do we make money here?  We make the protocol as useful as we possibly can.  Which I think is generally the point of a project, to do useful things.

Yes, a technical review points out problems.  A general "This is really complex" is a description, not point to a problem.  Vitalik went on to point out a few things he thought might be problems, and we discussed those issues in length.  Some of them resulted in more clarification.  But no big issues were identified.






We'll see what the market decides about centralization on this. I'm not sure it matters. Add in Johnston's involvement and constant insistence on selling tokens, and you can see where skepticism reigns.
Tokens == decentralization
Some applications might be able to use Bitcoin and still be decentralized.  Ride sharing might be one of those.  Because there are two parties and it is clear who needs to be paid what.  But not all applications fit that mode.  Factom for example has to distribute payments to servers for running the protocol.  How can I decentralize that function without either modifying Bitcoin to be "Factom Aware" or by having a token?


I don't see the need for anyone to hold or hoard Factoids.  People will, because they can.  But there is no need for it.
As I showed you earlier, Factoids would have to have a value even if every Factoid in existence was only used to access the protocol.  And their value will rise with more use of the protocol, because the inflation is a fixed value.  X number of Factoids (set by the crowd sale) are issued per day to the servers.  That inflow (plus any that might be flowing around in the market) must cover the cost of the Entry Credits needed for the entries being written into Factom
With no hoarding, the value of X factoids must support the volume of entries written into Factom per day.

The main difference between a for profit and a non-profit is the fact that a for profit can take on investors and pay them a return for their investment.  A non-profit cannot take on investors, because they cannot pay them a return on their investment.

You need an inventory of Factoids if you are selling entry credits.
You need entry credits before you write to the protocol.

The definition of money velocity is that money changes hands repeatedly.  If I am looking at just the generation of Factoids and the conversion of Factoids into entry credits, there is no money velocity.  Once converted to Entry Credits, the Factoids cannot cycle anymore. 
Speculation can have velocity, trading among each other.  Which is why I think answering your question without speculation is easier.  Obviously speculation can cause Factoids to be valued even without any use for the token (i.e. Bitcoin).


No, it is more like just the Bitcoin reward, and no transaction fees.  Factom servers do not get any fees, only the fixed reward.




Just like any store needs an inventory.  Just like you need a tank of gas to drive around.


Transfer would not be slow.  But how do you know you will have the seller you need when you need them?  But as I said before, even if you ignore any holding time, you still have to have Factoid value.

The tokens are designed to reflect the value of the protocol.
@_date: 2015-03-23 04:08:01
We have covered all of this.  So to summarize
* Factoids will have value if the protocol has value.
* Speculation will increase the value of Factoids.  Much like a high P/E ratio for high growth companies does.
* The token sale will be risky. No doubt.  If you have any doubts, you shouldn't buy in.  
* We will have a working protocol before any of the token sale funds are released to us.  So it isn't a pre-sale, but literally a sale of software rights.
* At the end of the token sale, we only get 1/3 the raise.  We have to meet two other milestones, rounding out all the features of the protocol before the remaining funds are released.  Again, not a pre-sale at all.  A sale of software with a defined set of features within a defined timeframe, with teeth in these milestones.
* The Factoids will be sold 2000 for 1 BTC for a week, then scale linearly up in price to 1500 for 1 BTC over the rest of the 45 days of the crowd sale.
* Once the protocol is completely decentralized and running, there will be no way to do any more token sales except by consensus of the federated servers and the users of the protocol.  That isn't ever going to happen.
* We started in May, and a year later we should have a usable protocol in the market.
I know you don't like the token, you prefer the normal corporate structures, centralized control, and thus placing applications like this potentially in control of regulators.  All so companies can insist on taking Bitcoin as payment.
I believe had we gone that route, we might have raised 4 or 5 million in seed money, and set ourselves up for a A round in the 30 to 50 million dollars.  You think I am kidding, but I was sitting in the meetings with the people that hold checkbooks like that.

Early money is the riskiest.  There is NO reason to buy in now.  You will be able to buy tokens later. The token could go down in price; then you should have waited to buy.  Heck, I bought quite a bit of Bitcoin at 600 and 700 dollars.  Should have waited.
That doesn't make either Bitcoin nor Factom a fraud.  They are just an early and risky investments.

I am going to be kicking off the ride on Wednesday, March 25.  I'd like to do the full 20 miles over one day, but I can't push it too hard and run a conference over the weekend.  So I will see how it goes.

There is no trusted third party involved in the Factom Ledger.  It is all secured by the Bitcoin blockchain, not by a trusted third party.  Bitcoin transactions are open to filtering by any policy that miners might like to employ.  Factom at least has some mechanisms to fight such censorship.  
1. Factom does no validation; validation is done client side.  
2. By doing an Entry commit separate from an Entry reveal, the protocol is obligated to record an entry before it knows what the entry is.
Once the data is recorded, and a hash entered into Bitcoin, anyone can get a Merkle proof from their entries (or entry blocks) into Bitcoin.  The anchors can all be validated looking at Factom's Directory blocks and the Bitcoin blockchain.
You keep going on about a trusted third party when there isn't one. Factom servers are trustless.  You don't have to trust them, you just have to validate and verify them.  The trust is in the math, and the servers are held accountable to produce valid structures. Factom isn't really different from Bitcoin itself.
And about the complexity....
Factom is both very complex and very simple.  By this I mean that there are very few code paths in its implementation.  There are pipelines of processes that must be implemented (that's the complex part) but very few decisions or paths through the code (that is the simple part).
I have been building systems like this for years and years.   I wrote a Rules Engine for Texas in about a year and a half by myself that pretty much does all the tasks any Rules Engine does (Drools, iLog, etc. etc.).  Texas (and Michigan) process literally billions of dollars worth of assistance program eligibility through that engine every year.  And Texas has done so over 14 years using that Rules Engine.  That one guy wrote in a year and a half with little to no updates.
That's not supposed to be possible.  But it is, if you can limit the number of paths through a complex system.  See DTRules in Github for the code.  That's actually the 3rd implementation of the Rules Engine, and quite a bit better than what they are using in Texas, but it still is good enough for you to look at.

Actually.... no.  Can be scams, are nearly always scams... those sentences can make sense.  But you can't claim on one hand that, "No one is doubting that you are trying to solve a real world problem" and on the other hand claim Factom is a scam.
IF we are really doing something of value THEN what we are doing isn't a scam.  There are perhaps better ways to raise money (you suggest asking for donations), but that is something people argue over.  Someone else might claim we are a scam if we just ask for donations.

Those running Factom servers pay the Bitcoin fees, so Factom users don't worry about them.  The number of entries is small, and fixed (one every 10 minutes) no matter how many entries are placed into Factom.

Johnston made a number of points, completely ignored by the other side.  There have been, and continue to be tokens used all the time.  Factom completely demonstrates this.  The tokens come to the servers, and the servers (or delgates, which is what a tradable token allows) can exchange them for Bitcoin or dollars or whatever in return for access to the protocol.
Nobody has to "hold them" for the tokens to have value.  And no matter how much Daniel kept claiming that the only way a token holds value is if they are held,  Factom clearly shows that isn't necessary.

You said, "You aren't looking for rational and critical investors, you are looking for gamblers."
This might have been poorly stated, but you are implying something about motives here.  Not who might be interested in what we are doing, but who WE are looking for.  We are not in any way looking for gamblers.


IF you are giving me the benefit of the doubt that, in fact, Factom is designed to tie the value of the token to the value of the protocol, THEN I am not sure what all the other complaints are about.  


We will not have a "presale" if the protocol (which has been out in Alpha since January) can go live at the end of the sale.  It cannot go live until the end of the sale, because that defines the initial distribution.
This line is interesting to me:


Largely because my Uncle Paul (for whom I am named) only invests in real estate.  That is because, over 50 years, he believes investing in stock is completely rigged, and the only people that would invest in Wall Street are those with gambling issues. 
One person's investment is another's gambling.  Your complaint about how much information you need to reasonably invest in Factom is a subjective argument that I cannot address.  Unless you can give me an objective way to measure the value of an investment, or can give me an objective measure of risk, then your complaint is subjective.
If your complaint is just that *you would never* invest in something like Factom, I'd say great!  Neither would many, many other people.  On the other hand if you want to claim *nobody would ever* invest in something like Factom based on a rational own risk/reward basis... Well, I don't think you can win that argument.  My own investment into Factom is pretty significant, and I am doing so based on what I think the value of the protocol is, and how well the token will reflect that value.
Of course, you would say I am thus not rational.  There goes that "All Knowing" thing again.  I can't beat someone in an argument who can know so much but refuses to explain how they know it.

Factom pays out a FIXED number of Factoids to the Federated Servers each period, with an inflation rate of 20% of the tokens issued during the crowd sale.  If the tokens are worthless, then when someone tries to buy 1000 Entry credits, then they can't use the protocol.  
Here is the math behind two scenarios.  One with nearly no volume of entries, and another with a high volume of entries. 
Really low volume
* total Factoids in existence = 100 Factoids
* cost of an entry is 1/10 a penny
* Factoids value = 0
* Volume of Entries = 1


Thus we cannot support this volume of one entry with a price of zero.  Why? 


In fact, we can calculate the value of a Factoid required to write one entry into Factom under this scenario:


Even here, Factoids are REALLY cheap, but they are not worthless.
High Volume
So let's examine the other side.  Instead of nearly no volume (which none the less still prices Factoids &gt; 0), let's consider a world where Factom is solving real problems, and has sustained high volumes of entries.  (Actual estimates are far higher that these numbers)
* total Factoids in existence = 100 Factoids
* cost of an entry is 1/10 a penny
* Volume of Entries = 1,000,000,000
 * Land Titles -- 100,000,000 entries, 
 * Other Government Records -- 200,000,000 entries
 * artists backing their creative process -- 300,000,000 entries,
 * Reputation and Identity for IoT apps -- 400,000,000 entries.  
But Absolutely NOBODY is holding them.


Each Factoid would have to be worth 1 million each.  Why?  Because there is no "velocity" here.  A Factoid converted to an Entry Credit doesn't come back.  So if the Factoids are priced SOLELY to provide access to the protocol, then they MUST be worth something.

* Decentralization, Autonomous operation
 * Can't be shut down;  there are no central parties to shut down, and another would just take the place of a party that is shut down.
 * Users are not subject the whim of a central authority
 * Lower costs, because funds going into the protocol don't go to investors or corporate structures
* Token rules in Factom don't fit how Bitcoin behaves.
* Bitcoin transactions are ultimately expensive and we are right at the limit for them.  Factoids don't bloat the blockchain, do what we need them to do, they are cheaper to transact, and clear faster, all in the context of Factom.
And of course, a token provides a funding model.  But that isn't assured to be a bad thing.  Tokens for funding have advantages:
 
* A Token does fund the launch of the protocol, and provides a structured way to distribute initial tokens.
* Tokens are available to everyone; stock offerings are not open to everyone
* Traditional funding is based on being a central party.  Central parties have say over everyone using the protocol.
* Corporate structures are subject to insider deals and treatment
* Tokens can't have a series of "rounds of funding" further diluting an early interest.
BTW, did listen to the LTB debate on my Unicycle ride this afternoon. (10.67 miles today... Training for the 20 miles I'll be riding in the [Ride Across Austin]( event.  I'd guess we both suffer from massive confirmation bias, as I didn't think Daniel did a good job at all at making his point.
This idea that you can't build a token that gets value from an application designed to use the token is frankly absurd.  The Dollar is exactly such a token, since its primary value is you have to have them to pay taxes.  But many, many other examples exist, and Daniel's insistence that they don't I think completely undermines his position.  
That said, I think David and Tom could have done better.  They could have focused on Daniel's unproven Axioms, especially since there are so many counter examples to Daniel's claims.
Still, in the end a debate isn't the same as proof.  It is a contest of how well one can argue their side rather than a study or actual evidence of anything.  In any event, everyone in the debate seemed honest and earnest in their position;  nobody looked bad.
One contention your side makes all the time is that the only way an AppCoin keeps value is if people hold them.  This I showed to you repeatedly to simply not be true.  If you do want to do a google hangout with me, we would work through the model I made for Factom.  There isn't any way that Factoids will not hold value, EVEN if they are only used in the last minute to buy Entry Credits.  On the other hand, if Factom has no volume, no use, it becomes worthless.  As it should.

You still might be able to make creditors take bitcoin without making Bitcoin legal tender, but that depends upon how lawyers interpret terms...

He was doing a review of a design.  Yeah, it would be "his job" in that role to say, "Hey!  You don't need this, because X"


Centralized providers have to be trusted to do their job, and they can extract arbitrary tolls, and they can be regulated and shut down.  You also have a trust problem where countries or financial institutions have to sign on with company X.  Much easier to sign on with a protocol.
IF you want to say that the only decentralized service anyone should ever have is Bitcoin, THEN yeah, you win.  But I would contend that 1) you would be wrong, and 2) there is no way to prove such an assertion except by faith.
If this is just about the true religion, then there is no discussion.  If it is about actual implementation of a service, I think you have to accept this to be a possible and valid design goal.


Censorship and regulation and trust are all factors PRIOR to recording.  By the way, a set of centralized parties was what I worked on for a few months.  I argued and argued that side.  And oh by the way, David was happy to fund the effort for those months pursuing a semi-centralized solution if I said that was the right way to do it.  But the push back was extreme, and none of the many parties I discussed the design with liked the idea that we would have to sell customers on having trust with a company in this fashion.

The Notary feature was not part of that discussion, and it is a nice touch.
BTW, with Factom you never have to be "unable to prove your honesty".  Every single structure in Factom is anchored to the Bitcoin blockchain, and Factom provides Merkle proofs of anything within Factom.  If you keep your Merkle proofs (like you keep your copy of the timestamped contract/message), you can prove your data. 
Factom can fail and you are unable to put MORE data into Factom, but once data is in Factom, it is backed by the Bitcoin blockchain.  Not Factom.
**tl;dr** A Factom user proves their data against Bitcoin, not Factom.  So Factom isn't necessary to prove a user's data, so Factom can fail without putting you in the position of not being able to prove your honesty.

Very "All Knowing" of you.


How did I parrot something I had not  heard at the time I made my observations?
My point to you was entirely different than what David said.  To recap my point: Gift cards are mostly bought to give.  Many reasons for that.  They do not have to have, and often do not have a fixed value.  If a Gift Card is denominated in dollars, but we consider them to be store credit, then the store can and will raise or lower prices.  Change the terms of the card, for example omitting some products from purchase with the card.
And Daniel is completely wrong when he asserts people will not hold  various tokens.  People do.  They do to collect enough to gain a particular product, or to gain a level where they get perks denied those outside the reward program.  Or just as a matter of convenience (a charged subway card avoids a token purchase with each ride).
I am not sure why David and Tom chose to ignore the obvious, and that is that tokens are held all the time, despite not being as valuable as actual money.  Largely BECAUSE they are not as liquid.  If a token isn't liquid, how does one get the token "just in time" to do something with it?  If they can just buy the tokens anytime they like, then obviously someone can sell them anytime they like.
But why discuss the debate?  After all, I thought we were talking about Factom...

Ah.  A religious response to a technical discussion.  
I really don't get it.  If you think that this kind of mechanism doesn't work, please tell me what is wrong.  We actually have people who are actively putting this technology into their applications.  If there is a problem, not only will you help us to fix it, you will help to avoid people wasting their time.  But you have to articulate the problem with an explanation when it is given to you.
Or you can just religiously say it is bad, and point out PayCoin was a scam, and imply  that if you can find one failure, everyone that does something similar is a failure.  Mt. Gox failed, for example, it's fair to imply you cannot have an honest Bitcoin exchange.
I am always impressed by the extent that people will adopt religious creeds about technology in the face of logic and evidence that shows that such creeds do not hold.
In particular, PayCoin was a scam, not because of the tech they touted, but because they were dishonest.  Butterfly labs was a scam, not because of the tech they touted, but because they were dishonest.  Worldcom was a scam, and Enron was a scam, not because communications and energy are inherently evil, but because the people were dishonest.
With Factom, I think it is incumbent on you to either: 
1. Prove the use of tokens is fundamentally a perpetual motion machine and thus must be a scam, or 
2. Prove the people putting Factom together are dishonest and are not going to deliver the system they are talking about delivering.
The problem with 1 is that it only requires one example to disprove the theory, and we have many examples of businesses and systems that use tokens where the token itself is 1) purchased, and 2) traded to some extent, and 3) allows some use of a service that drives its value, and 4) is generally not considered a scam (by at least the people using them):
1. Bitcoin
2. MPesa
3. Chuck E Cheese tokens
4. World of War Craft Gold
5. Airline Miles
6. Green Stamps (That one is dated, but I remember them)

"converting a bunch of factoids" costs money.  If we have broad adoption of Factom, then this would be a very, very expensive attack.
Further, it is unnecessary.  Factom allows you to write to any chain you wish.  So writing your malware into some chain maintained by doesn't require you to elect a server into the Federated Server Pool just to write your entry.   
But here is the kicker.  The client software using this chain would almost certainly require a signature that requires a private key that the attacker simply doesn't have.  So writing your entry will do no good, as anyone iterating over the chain will see that your entry doesn't validate, and they will ignore you.
Keep in mind, Factom doesn't do much of anything.  It simply allows users of the protocol to create Factom chains, and then write entries to those Factom chains.   It doesn't validate, verify, or censor.  That is all done client side.
The power here is that you must attack the client.  Attacking Factom doesn't buy you anything.

I don't think it matters that you are in if you are willing to discuss what happened and what Bitcoin provides in terms of enforcement vs what is possible with the banks.
When the Savings and Loan Crisis hit in the 1980's about 1100 bankers went to jail over 100 billion dollars (real money at the time).
Certainly the US isn't putting enough money into prosecutions.  But is it money well spent to chase Bitcoin?  The ratios of cost return do matter.


This is actually not true.  Unlike banks and cash, Bitcoin provides a immutable audit trail for financial transactions ... Forever. 
Large institutions (well, in the Bitcoin world Mt. Gox qualified at one time) cannot hide their behavior.  For example, Mt. Gox claimed to have lost 800,000 bitcoin.  And people (largely from Reddit) pooled information they had as customers, and found 200,000 bitcoin that HAD to be in Mt. Gox's control.  Then, amazing enough, Mt. Gox found the self same 200,000 bitcoin.  
What a surprise.
That is the kind of story you can't have with banks.  And that is the kind of story we have with Bitcoin without any special regulation.  
Because the larger the organization is, the more transactions they have, and the more visible they are on the blockchain.

I don't think that this was a situation of a few people (this particular set of people) manipulating 800 trillion dollars of assets.  And there should be compliance officers (like Shrem) in banking responsible for stopping such crime, no?  
And if they ignored this sort of thing, should they not also be prosecuted?
The one executive that did get convicted worked for a relatively tiny Swiss bank (24 billion in revenue) that is assumed to have been laundering money for the American rich for decades.  How is he the only conviction?

Changes to the Bit License accommodate banking and finance.  The rest is just grammar fixes.  Oh, and some weasel words about granting exceptions. But no clear "Start up" path for bitcoin companies as promised.  
All the rest of the amazing harsh, expensive and punitive requirements (like disclosing every quarter your full strategic business plans) remain.

All code has bugs.  Which is why you need versions of code.  Updates.
Code changes over time in response to need.  I'd guess that is why Factom chains are of interest rather than just publishing hashes to the blockchain, or simple signed code.
@_date: 2015-02-03 18:54:40


Pretty accurate.  As long as "Fancy version of proof of existence" means that you can now track processes in Factom, i.e. Proof of Process, i.e. that some artifact exists, and is followed by the next artifact (perhaps an update), and the next and so forth.
Technically everything done in Factom can be done against the normal blockchain.  We just want to make it easier, faster, cheaper, and remove bloat from the blockchain (i.e. transactions that are not at their heart a Bitcoin Transaction (tm) ).
Factom allows an application (like what is doing with Factom Linux) to create their own Factom Chains.   These Factom Chains can track not just a frozen state of the system, but the hashes of vetted and versioned components of a Linux system, and even track them over time. (i.e. released and vetted versions are added to the chain for that component over time.)
This allows the software to be vetted and verified, binaries, and even vetted and versioned lists of components to create a wide variety of deployments to support a range of applications on a range of platforms.
This provides more flexibility and security than simple signed system states. Further, Factom Chains provide a way for various configurations to be updated over time at the component level, while still leveraging the security of vetted components not involved in the update.   Factom also provides a way to take feedback on configurations and solutions to issues which can then be leveraged by other systems that might have the same issues.
While the actual Factom development team isn't directly involved in this project, we are providing some support on how to leverage Factom to address the particular problems is attempting to solve.
I hope this helps.

@_date: 2015-02-04 01:55:16
Perhaps.  I work on Factom, so I want to give this project and many others the ability to create immutable chains of entries... Think of them as time stamped, signed records.
The advantage is that even if the key is compromised at some point in time, hashes can still be validated since you can't sign a record and insert it into the past.
Now can leverage this into a safer, harder to hack OS?  I don't know.
My job is to build Factom.  But I do see possibilities not possible with signatures alone.

Heads up... For what?  You do know almost all theft today is in dollars?  
Yes Bitcoin requires you to secure a set of  private keys.  But they can be secure and better apps are coming on line all the time to help with that.
But what you need to secure your  checking account are the numbers you have to put on every check.  To secure your credit cards you have secure the very numbers you have to fork over on every purchase.
Most of the "protections" in current payment systems are there because the payment systems today have no security.  Let's not even mention the costs that are paid ultimately by the consumer.
So if there is a "heads up" to have here it is that Bitcoin can improve.  But there isn't much anyone can do to fix the legacy payment systems... Other than to put in place something like Bitcoin.

Not a purest myself. Can we say we are not a dollar economy because most transactions are not in dollars but are in bank credit?


... Completely transparently to the customer.  They pay in old games and get product.  FIFY

Actually he specifically negates those qualifiers when he says:'


The world cannot use a global currency that can only denominate transactions with 1.3 billion dollars.  He wishes to ignore "economic impacts of" a list of supposed negative behaviors.  He doesn't say he expects the world economy to shrink to 1.3 billion dollars worth of transactions.
If he did, then his house loan would have been for 400 dollars,  or 40, or even 4 dollars.  But it couldn't have been for 400,000 dollars, as that would have placed the house's value at about 1/3000 of the world's GDP.
**edit**  Actually the word's GDP is about 84 Trillion.  That  means a 400K house makes up 400 / 84,000,000,000 of the world's GDP.  So the house should not make up too much more than that fraction of the 11 million Bitcoin at the time of purchase, assuming that Bitcoin is no longer in an adoption phase, but is the world's currency, and only changing in value in response to economic activity, and not the adoption process.

But you are not explaining why multiple forks solves any issue, if all nodes have to maintain all forks, you get nothing.  And you have to have all forks to validate transactions (even a very few transactions) between the forks.
All you need to do is process transactions in parallel, and compute the Merkle tree in parallel, **both of which you can do**.  The construction of a block of valid transactions can thus be constructed in an arbitrarily  fast, efficient, and parallel manner. Any change in structure of the global ledger (i.e. larger blocks vs multiple blocks) buys you nothing in size, or speed of processing...  Not if every node needs all chains anyway.

The security of Bitcoin isn't at risk for the foreseeable future.
And no currency has ever failed due to deflation (rising value).  Only hyperinflation has done that.  
The eventual rise of Bitcoin could trigger the hyperinflation of some over printed fiat...
The desire to save and protect the value of ones wages can be characterized as greed.  But so can the efforts of central banks to debase currencies to lower the value of debts denominated in those currencies (generally held by governments who sponsor the banks, and who give, or authorize, the supply of printed cash at highly discounted rates to the banks). This is done even knowing it decimates the values of wages, savings, and increases taxes (by making the retention of value legally a profit).
It is the greed of the current monetary polices of the world feeding the rising income gap that will fuel the rise of Bitcoin.  Expect the rise of the rich banks and their stooges loudly crying about the "greed" of Bitcoin.  Do not be fooled about where the real monetary greed lies.

I think any bank who steps up to provide liquidity for bitcoin (**edit:** in the US)  is the real turning point.  That bank would overnight get at least a billion dollars worth of business here in the US.  Particularly if it is a bank like BoA or Wells Fargo.
But even a smaller bank or even a credit union would find their resources instantly swamped.
That will be the turning point, in my estimation.  Until Bitcoin can easily flow back and forth into and out of Dollars, people can't even hold Bitcoin.  And once that is easy, bitcoin will simply skyrocket.

I expect bitcoin to follow a typical adoption curve.  That would put Bitcoin more like 30,000+ by December 2014.  It is just the math, and it assumes quite a bit in terms of block size  management and such.  Assuming all these issues are dealt with,  Bitcoin's value should remain at an exponential growth rate until it begins to approach is saturation level.  
We are maybe at .001 percent penetration  of Bitcoin's obvious markets.  Once we are close to 10 percent (that's 10,000x over today's positions), we will see a tipping point...  Then the rise in value for Bitcoin may be augmented by a collapse in value of the legacy currencies...  I wouldn't expect that for a few years yet.  Even at a trillion dollars, Bitcoin would remain relatively insignificant in a 1000+ trillion dollar global financial sector.
(I believe you map Bitcoin's value more to M3 and M4 numbers rather than hard assets or currency because it is easier to trade as itself rather than representations of itself.  That limits   fractionalizing it's supply... Which also explains it's unusually high value relative to it's market use over the last few years)
At a trillion dollars, Bitcoin would still be behind the euro and dollar and yen...  But it would be a heck of allot harder to ignore...

Maybe.  But you (I think) are putting too much significance in movements up to the $32 dollar peak, and between that peak and the $240 dollar peak.  If you look at a [log scale of the prices]( I think that shows a decrease of volatility with greater adoption.  Furthermore, since in the early years only the most technology technical and financially naive were trading, one would expect the dynamics to change with more financially aware entering the market.
And at the same time, even the financially aware are in new territory.  Because Bitcoin isn't really a commodity (because of its currency aspects) and it isn't a currency (because of its commodity aspects) and it isn't a stock (though it is being traded by some as if it was), and it really isn't any of that because it is a protocol for trading tokens (technically, and I am not sure we have ever had one of those). 
So the patterns are interesting, but expect surprises to come...  By the log chart, I'd guess a new high in the first or second quarter of 2014, but if it happened just prior to the new year (prompted by bank failures in France, or collapse in Japan, or any of the other possible dominoes that are just teetering right now) I would not be surprised.  But I don't expect the new high later than April 2014, and I don't expect it is possible for a new high before December 2013.
There.  I put it in writing and into the Reddit "block chain". ;)

That is why I say Bitcoin is too cheap.  By at least three orders of magnitude.
 
At 200 billion or 500 billion you can begin to buy a gulfstream, but it is still hugely tight.
The offshore account world needs a capitalization of 40 *trillion* or so.  That is 20000 times the capitalization of Bitcoin today. 
You are right about the difficulty of exchange between Bitcoin and dollars or euros.  But that will *rapidly* change once some of this "rich" money begins to pour in.  Supply and Demand, and nobody does Demand like the very rich.  
The critical period will be the next 2 or 3 orders of magnitude rise.  The rise needs to continue without a huge correction, but corrections of 20 or 30 percent will not slow the process much.  Anything of that magnitude is nothing to the upside.
All of this is guess work, you know.  But the odds that a dollar into Bitcoin today might yield 100 or 200 dollars a year or two down the road are still very, very good.

So... You are saying that people that invest in equities do not invest?
I personally believe that the financial markets place a huge burden on the economy, soaking up and concentrating wealth that, were it in the hands of more people, would be invested in more ideas, not fewer!
Take for example, well, Bitcoin!   This represents a way of paying someone around the world using a currency that doesn't need a bank or a government to back it!  Instead it uses distributed computing and encryption to eliminate the following:
* The need of a centralized third party to vet each partner in a transaction
* The need to set up agreements between multiple third parties where government lines separate the parties
* The expense of maintaining multiple accounts (those used by the parties of the transactions, and to support the transaction, and perhaps by the parties to support the accounts used in the transactions).
* Long waits while transactions clear monetary systems mostly patterned after physical transaction systems of the past.
And others.  But this is an idea we get to test.  It isn't an idea that could have arisen from Government regulations, Banks, and Corporate entities. 
Now how does providing people a medium to conduct transactions on their own with anyone else in the entire world a return to the Dark Ages?

There was no "hole" in my argument.  People that get in early on any investment nearly always make more (if the investment is successful).  The point that your returns on your holdings *going forward* are exactly the same as anyone else's, and your ability to acquire holdings *going forward* are exactly the same as anyone else's does in fact preclude a pyramid scheme.  
It would have been easier to just point out that Bitcoin *is* the product, and there is no membership.  But really, other than some people are making a great deal of money, there isn't any coloration between Bitcoin and, say, a Multi Level Marketing company.

You are connecting Bitcoin prices to mining.... there is a critical fallacy here.  The amount of cycles devoted to actually processing the transactions is nearly nil.  The purpose of the proof of work is to make it impossible to create a counterfeit chain (and thus rewrite the past).  
The cost per transaction must stay small.  As the network increases in volume, and the rewards diminish, fees replace rewards to pay miners.  But it remains a rather limited cost to make the Bitcoin network economical, and thus the cost of energy for mining cannot exceed the amounts provided per block (one every 10 minutes).  If it does, then miners begin to lose money, and there is little reason to mine.
So consider a world where the transaction fees dwarf the block reward (in about 8 years).  Further suppose that the equilibrium point is 20% over the energy costs. Heck, let's assume people mining are willing to get by on 1% of a margin.  Anymore and they are losing money.  If that ends up at 5 cents per transaction, then what does that say about the current financial system?  We pay 3 to 6 percent per domestic credit card transaction, and 5 to 15 percent or more for International transaction.  On top of that we pay fees for accounts, we lose money for fraud, we pay taxes for law enforcement...  
Somehow I doubt the energy cost of all of that is less than a few pennies per transaction.

I am saying that because Bitcoin is most flexibly used directly rather than through accounting in third party systems, it takes more value in Bitcoin to support transactions than is required by the legacy currencies.  
Put another way, In the case of legacy currencies, their hard currency forms are near worthless for transactions (what, we are going to fly paper all around the world just to transact trade?).  
But Bitcoin in its base form is more secure to "transport" , more secure to hold, and faster and less risky than banking instruments.  So it is harder to make the case for banks holding your Bitcoin for you and translating your Bitcoin for you, especially for large transactions.
So Bitcoin will displace more of the monetary supply of legacy currencies because it just take more Bitcoin to do the same things.

Not so sure... Deflation always raises the real value of wages.  Inflation always depresses the real value of wages.  This is because wages are sticky.  Pretty much all economists agree with this, even if they discount the importance of the effect.
Economies are not the product of one variable.
@_date: 2013-11-05 21:55:57


Likely.  But if you went down the list and used dollars (not banking services; those could support any currency, even paintings) as the standard for those points, all would have to go to Bitcoin I think.  Dollars would only have the advantage of face to face transactions without tech.






Rapid deflation is certainly good for a *currency*.  More valuable means more desire for it, and greater preference for it.
Sustained and rapid deflation *might* be bad for the economy, but no currency in the history of money has failed because it was to valuable.  (Debt can collapse, but nobody owes Bitcoin to speak of, so that isn't an issue).


Any time people are automated out of a job, particularly smart people, then the economy can use them to do more productive tasks.
Bitcoin cannot be counterfeited.  Bitcoin cannot be stolen by force like cash in a vault.  You don't need banks, ATMs, vaults, armed cars.  You can't rob a bank with guns to take Bitcoin really.  It has its risks (securing l keys and all) but these tasks can be automated and do not require exposure to the public.
Extensions to Bitcoin will allow trading of commodities, stocks, cryptographically secure contracts, tie payments to those contracts.
When we move away from debt based money... The growth of the economy will benefit every one based on resources, and not hogged by those controlling leveraged financial instruments.  It won't be perfect, but better than the last 50 years.
This doesn't require Bitcoin to"win", only for banks to up their game to compete.  Actually I think they will lose because they cannot change, but they could change.

Proof? Data?


The money illusion.  Again, standard JMK economics.


Trickle down doesn't work.  Giving banks more money doesn't help the poor.  Bubbles are certainly issues, but not the primary problem.


People accept lower and lower wages.  Executive pay goes up, investor returns go up, and fewer wage earners have money to invest.  Presto.  Income gap.
Inflation is the solution if wages are too high.  Again, classic JMK economics.


So why is tech magically okay with deflation, but not other sectors?


Proof?  Data?  The long depression 1873-1879 did not demonstrate this dynamic.


 
Or if we leave it all alone, the economy can sort this stuff out.  Meddling with monetary policy assumes we know more and better than the market does, and that banks always act in the interest of the whole rather than in their own interests.
No reason exists to believe any of this.

.... Because?
Bitcoin IS a Bittorrent to the previous centralized servers for file sharing.  Earlier centralized currencies were crushed.
Bitcoin isn't done yet either.  Innovations in payment processing are just a month or so away.  New methods for detecting double spends in real time are being explored.
The hash power of Bitcoin is making Bitcoin the most secure currency of the cryptocurrencies.  
All of this is going to make unseating Bitcoin difficult at best.  And should another currency rise, crypto currencies are far more liquid than dollars.  Those in Bitcoin will be able to convert quickly, far more quickly than those in dollars.

The other factor is parking value.  Currently there is 30 Trillion to 70 Trillion in off shore accounts, to avoid taxes and such.  As long as Bitcoin is without a state, International Tax law I think would treat it as an off shore account for all countries.  With the advantage that the account is instantly available anywhere, can be split in to thousands of sub accounts (Bitcoin addresses), immune to seizure and audit, 
Unlike trade (where the same Bitcoin can be used over and over, so your 21 Trillion doesn't necessarily force Bitcoin to a 1 million evaluation), parking money does require the Bitcoin to Dollar ratio to hold.  Because nobody is exchanging it much.
50 Trillion (the mid number) / 15 million (Max Supply through ~2016) gives you 3.33 million per bitcoin.  Fold in supply for transactions (about 1/2 of 21 trillion) and you get a value of bitcoin of about 4 million.
We can play these games all day.  The value of a Bitcoin will either be pretty much 0 or greater than 100,000 in 5 years.  I don't see Bitcoin surviving if it doesn't grow radically.  And personally, I see current monetary systems collapsing rapidly with the adoption of crypto currency.  Anything the current system might do to try and compete with Bitcoin (like support for direct transactions) will further enable the transition to Bitcoin.

Alternatively, Savings provide a way to buy later goods you know you will need, but don't need at present.  This is the concept of retirement, vacations, sick leave, etc.  In your "perfect economy" there is no room for purchases outside of periods of work, no room for investment.
In a Bitcoin world, liquidity isn't a problem.  You don't have to create extra money to provide liquidity, because the Bitcoin changing hands rises in value to meet the demands.  You don't have to have banks and investment houses (taking huge cuts off the top of pensions and 401k accounts, and investing in risky ventures) solely to be able to buy tomorrow what you can today with your wages.
Investments should be that.  Investments.  Savings should be preserved because they are, well, savings.
This does cut out much of the profit of the financial sector.  But it also allows working people to reclaim what they actually worked for, rather than making them subject to a financial sector that taxes away the value of their savings and wages through inflation, interest on debt, etc.
Another thing about purchases from wages...  Having a market with the resources to buy goods forces efforts to produce goods to make money.  Sure it is nice to "leverage" assets and to seek a return far higher than your holdings would suggest.  But it is also nice to win a lottery.  Doesn't mean that approach is better for the economy than actual work and the production of products.

I see what you did there.  No, it isn't a linear fit.  You just have a small enough section of the curve that you can kinda sorta make a linear claim.  but it isn't linear, which if you look at as much data as we have, you can clearly see. Here is the M2 Money supply for the biggest set of data that we have, plotted on a log scale.  Note how truly linear it seems.  I.e. you have an exponential growth going on there.
And here is M2 on a regular scale.  You see the every rising rate of growth.  Again...  Pretty Exponential.  You want to take any 20 year section, and ignore all the other data, and you can make a "nearly perfect linear fit" claim.  But it wouldn't be valid. 
Now let's consider how much money is being generated by the Federal Reserve.  This is the Monetary Base.  The MB supply for as much data as we have shows growth that is even faster than exponential growth at times, i.e. it isn't even linear on a log scale:

Failed to post my analysis of your texts... sorry about that!


Romans 12 ends with:
21 **Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.**
Chapter 13 is detail about how to overcome evil (government) with good (being subject).  Along with some theology about God's active had in the affairs of mankind, which may be taken for what it is worth.  It is difficult to accept the idea that all the horrors perpetrated by governments is all good, and we should support it all.
In both the textual context and historical context (after all, Paul was executed by the Romans), governments can certainly be bad and abuse those doing what is right.  You obey, but not so as to void the higher calling...


This is about church leadership.  Irrelevant. 


Leaving out verses 11 and 12?
11 Dear friends, I urge you, **as foreigners and exiles,** to abstain from sinful desires, which wage war against your soul. 12 Live such good lives among the pagans that, though **they accuse you of doing wrong,** they may see your good deeds and glorify God on the day he visits us.
We are apart from government and the countries in which we reside...


And to continue:
2 to slander no one, to be peaceable and considerate, and always to be gentle toward everyone.
3 **At one time we too were foolish, disobedient, deceived and enslaved by all kinds of passions and pleasures. We lived in malice and envy, being hated and hating one another.**
This isn't a high bar for government.  They are as we once were... Nasty.


22 for those two will send sudden destruction on them,
    and who knows what calamities they can bring?
In other news, dropping a heavy rock on your foot will hurt.  These kinds of observations are made not because the Bible is happy about governments, but because, as I said, the **Bible is very cynical about governments**.
You have not made your point.  And you cannot make your point if you ignore the context of the verses you quote.  You should never go to some source where they are giving verses to support some view you have, and not look up those verses and understand the context in the text in which they appear, and in the context of the one writing them, to whom they wrote, and the goal of the writing in general.

You do know they are also accessing cameras at ATMS and stop lights.  Plate readers, and other stuff.  This potentially allows tracking of you even if you do not cooperate in any way.  But if you take your phone to make a cash transaction, you know you are just as screwed as if you had used a Windows based laptop to do a transaction in plain text.
On the other hand, you can do all your bitcoin transactions off line. No Internet access is required to accept a payment.  No Internet is necessary to generate an address to accept a transaction.  You can prep transactions to pay others offline, and put them on a USB, or send them encrypted anywhere in the world.  Then upload your transaction (or trigger in some way the upload) to the Bitcoin network anywhere you like.  
You can have your phone trigger the transaction remotely.  And the trigger need not be direct.  It could simply be a detail on  a trivial bitcoin transaction that a passive listener picks up on, or a message on a forum, or a tweet, or whatever.
Seriously, while defeating the spying of the NSA might be nigh impossible, the tools for defeating it are much better with Bitcoin than traditional cash, checks, credit cards, wires, etc.

[Bank Reserve Requirements](
* Of less than $12.4 million have no minimum reserve requirement;
* Between $12.4 million and $79.5 million must have a liquidity ratio of 3%;
* Exceeding $79.5 million must have a liquidity ratio of 10%.
In a system where the money supply is based on debt, saving is a problem.  In systems where the money supply is based on an asset, or even a limited set of tokens (like Bitcoin), then debt isn't as important.  
Saving in a mattress pulls money out of the banking system, and limits the interests the financial sector can charge.  So it isn't good for the financial sector.  But it is questionable if it s bad for the rest of the economy.

Why would there be no loans?  People are loaning Bitcoin today, and its growth in value is far and away worse than it will be once its user base quits growing exponentially.


The central bank we had in 1793 was only responsible for 20 percent of the currency, the balance coming from state banks.  Its charter was not renewed in 1811, so it died away. So the question is the opposite:  Why did people invest without a dominate central bank?  And if it did any good at all, why was it allowed to die when its charter ran out?


Seriously?  Please demonstrate that nobody is willing to invest Bitcoins... They are.  


What Banks do is place a debt on every dollar.  The money supply is created when Banks loan out money, keeping only a fraction in reserve. (Fractional Reserve Banking).  The result is that every dollar in the economy is owed back to the banks, with interest.  How can we pay back interest on debts unless someone else defaults?  Ultimately when too many people demand their money, the banks default, and the money supply collapses. 
Banks do not incentivize investing.  Banks create debt that causes money to pool with the very wealthy.  Thus the income gap that keeps growing and growing....


One way to look at it.  Or you could take John Keynes view:




Been there, and tried that.  This is a terrible myth.


They are forced into risky investments (safe ones do not return enough).  And thus we have people today without pensions, without value in their 401(k) accounts.  This is the result that we see in the real world.  It didn't happen because of Republicans either (well, not by their idiotic behavior).  It has happened because monetary policy is a powerful thing.


Moving money around is what Bitcoin is good at.  Banks, Credit cards, money services, these are all leaches with artificial barriers and tolls to moving money.

Oddly, you have enough pronouns involved that "spending" still makes some sort of sense.  You are "increasing what you got," only what you got isn't money but stuff.  And you are putting a little "stuff" (just not money) to the side each month.

It would absolutely be a near PERFECT reserve currency.  Audits could be done by anyone, i.e. the bank could publish their holding addresses.  Do they have Bitcoin backing?  I can look and say, "Why yes! Yes they do!".
They could even back *every single currency unit with its own bitcoin address*.  So I could check not only if the bank has enough bitcoin, but if my own bitcoin based currency has backing!  And I could go to the bank and "redeem my note" by having the actual backing bitcoin sent from that address to my own.
If the banks want to inflate the currency, they could reduce the "backing rate" of the currency.  And the user could check the address printed on the note and watch the note's value fall!  In real time! How fun is that!
If the bank wants to use a "redeemed note" again, all they have to do is recharge it, and hand it to someone else.
But the question remains, how often would you hold a note rather than the actual Bitcoin?  I can think of some *limited uses* for Bitcoin notes (off line transactions), but mostly no.  Why would I want to have to go to the bank to redeem my notes?  I'll take the actual Bitcoin, thank you very much!

The only problem for the merchant and the user is that using a third party to facilitate Bitcoin Transactions makes that third party a MSB.  But that isn't too much of a problem, since they likely would have to do those kinds of disclosures anyway.

Bitcoin competes with banks by largely eliminating the need for most banking services.

As a commodity, Bitcoin establishes its value. As a technology that supports cash like transactions over the internet, it will be successful as a currency if it has value.
The continued rise in value of Bitcoin doesn't doom it to bring a commodity; it is necessary as a step to becoming a currency.
I am a bit tired of the "it can't be a currency if people treat it as a commodity" argument.  Gold is the most historically common money for all humanity, and it has always been both a money and a commodity.

I am working on a Bitcoin personal banker that does key management for you.  Can even use multiple banks to provide multiple keys on cold storage accounts.  The point is that key management is getting better, and can do so without banks.  Better than banks even.


I think I am confused.  The original dollar was a note for some amount of gold (1.67 g in 1900).  No interest, but it saved you from having to carry around heavy gold.  If you lost the paper, the house wins.  No interest, though naturally the currency was somewhat deflationary (so some rise in value over time).
Inflation of the money supply and prices and fractional reserve banking and interest rate price fixing etc etc makes the dollar (and every other major currency) a rubber ruler when it comes to measuring value.  The banks are central to this.  While some might trade in "hard Bitcoin" for bank notes, I doubt banks could get away with the same song and dance when their notes are actually harder to use than the Bitcoin they represent.  Having to cough up real coin on demand is a powerful break on leveraging...

Uhhh no.  If productivity falls, prices will *rise* as there is a fixed amount of currency chasing fewer products.  This makes businesses more profitable because their expenses (like wages) will rise slower than prices (which people have to pay because there is less competition).  Which drives more competition because there is no government to suppress competition.  Then prices begin to fall again, which effectively raises wages, so people can afford to buy more.  Which also tends to deplete the stores of the earlies  in your story.  They get nervous and begin to invest, driving more productivity.  Which raises wages, driving more jobs and higher productivity.
The investment companies then are funded by the earlies which, while actually losing numerical Bitcoin over time, they gain tremendous real buying power, not just for themselves, but for everyone.
Had you just stayed in the future a little longer, you would have seen the praise the world came to give the earlies  for freeing the world from a centralized, elite, uncaring cabal, to a distributed system of wealth that trends towards level 
 wealth distributions...

You may really need Bitcoin. Let's say you turn 39 in 10 years (as I don't know how old you are).  If the next 10 years only run at the inflation rate of the previous 10 years, your 3 million is really only $2,377,609.12, per the [Inflation Calculator](
Also keep in mind that CPI is really more of a lower bound on inflation.  It quite clearly and purposely ignores increases in productivity and technology.  So the real inflation rate is much higher, meaning that dollar investments really need to be highly productive to keep from losing the real buying power of your money.
The argument about the true inflation rate is impossible to win, because inflation and fractional reserve banking and debt based currencies take away any ability to measure value over time.  The argument about how to balance and account for value with such monetary polices is impossible to resolve.
What it means for you is that you should be highly pessimistic. Aim for twice what you think you will need, and you will only be a little short.

You could inflate the supply or the value.  Bitcoin is inflating the value.  Since each Bitcoin can be divided into 10,000,000 units, inflating the value is easy and doesn't reduce the utility of BTC at all.

You may know more than me (though I highly doubt that).  But you can not listen as well as I can, because you are trying to win and to teach.  You do not care to learn.

You said, "Investing is buying an ASSET that produces INCOME."  Not all real estate purchases produce income.  Not all stock purchases produce income (not all of them pay dividends).  I don't really think much of your definition or your rule of investing, or your moral/ethical code of investing and risk.
There is nothing wrong with wealth preservation.  And honestly, there was nothing wrong with registering 3 letter domain names in the 1990's, or buying up frequency band licenses in the 1980's.  And there isn't anything wrong with buying Bitcoin.
Why?  Because the fundamentals of a technology that removes vast overheads on transactions imposed by banking and credit companies is a good bet.  A technology that gives anyone a free account, which can hold as little or as much "coin" as you need it to.  A technology that uses military grade encryption and digital signatures to lock down transactions and insure nobody can inflate the money supply.
If you want to call it speculation, feel free.  Those of us that understand what the technology means, and how it shifts resources away from money handlers into the market made up of consumers and businesses.... Well, we see it as pretty much a sure bet.
Bitcoin may not even be the tech that ultimately shifts us from an inflation based economy (which concentrates wealth with those nearest the money tap) to a modestly deflating currency based economy (where increased productivity increases the value of wages and savings, giving people resources to act within the economy without having to borrow money).
FACT:  Increased Productivity increases the value produced in our economy.  We have had productivity increases pretty solidly for 40 years.  Without inflating the money supply to account for increased productivity, the costs of goods would go down, because the cost to produce those goods have been dropping.  For 40 years.  Why then is CPI calculated to hold the "basket of goods" at a steady price?  It does so to effectively reduce the real value of wages and savings, while claiming the dollar has only "modestly" inflated...
We live in the most productive age in history (in terms of productivity per worker).  How is it that distributing the goods produced across the population is so much harder today than in the past?

Lastly gold has been manipulated to a lower price relative to dollars, largely to maintain a fiction of backing that didn't really exist, hence the slow departure from the gold standard over the hundred years of the federal reserve.

There isn't really any factual difference.  If you record serial numbers on a dollar bill, and you report it stolen, then that bill could be shunned.  To do this we could require vetting of dollar bills.
A dollar bill is submitted to processing on a transaction, but it could be barred because it is dirty.  If it is a deposit, the bank can just take it.  The customer could fight it, but if it is dirty money it would likely take a bank or government to "clean it"
Bitcoin could go through some indeterminate number of hands, and poof... It is bad too.
The only difference is you won't need a scanner for Bitcoin... But you will have to creatively interpret the block chain...

Really?  And what is central bank "management" of an economy if not manipulation.
@_date: 2013-07-25 00:32:04


Yes and no.  We have gone off and on gold many times.  If the Dollar truly crashes (as it well might given the massive monetary base issued in the last few years by the Fed and other central banks) then we might see some sort of return to Gold to restore confidence.  Every major currency backed by reserves in Dollars (and other currencies backed by Dollars) will be in a world of hurt.  Gold (and other commodities) may be the only way to stave off a complete collapse. 
Banks issue dollars both historically and presently in many ways We didn't have the Fed until 1914, so prior to that banks issued notes obviously. Today, Fractional Reserve Banking is responsible for the majority of the inflation of money.  Those dollars are indistinguishable from Dollars issued by the Federal Reserve, as they are easily converted to paper dollars and change printed by the Treasury.


This is unclear to me what you are talking about.  When you take out a loan, you are given dollars (or dollars are directed to the entity that you are buying from).  If you go bankrupt and default, who ever got the dollars from the bank when you took out your loan still has their dollars.  Your assets might get burned up, but not all the dollars of your loan are going to burn.  Some are left in the market.  
Of course, there is a ripple effect if enough people default that banks begin to default on their loans, and more and more assets are captured and burned in attempts to pay back loans, collapsing the money supply.  But in no event are all the dollars captured.  Because if they were, nobody would default.


This could be valuable for transactions that need to occur off the grid, where people do not have access to the Internet.  And each bill could have a transaction number identifying a transaction with multiple keys.  This would allow spreading of the trust across multiple parties for the value of that bill.  And it would require the surrendering of the bill and the action of the backers to release the funds behind that bill.  Of course, you can't do fractional banking this way.
Or they could just print a bill, and claim to back it.  Then if there is a run on the bank, they are in trouble.  Nobody can just "print off" Bitcoin to stave off a run.  Maybe they first back in bitcoin, but reserve the right to pay in Dollars if there is a run?


Yes, but it is just as dangerous as it was when banks did this with customer redeemable Gold.  You have to be *very careful* that you don't get in a position where everyone wants your backing commodity...


Not really.  Because unlike Gold as used in the past, Bitcoin is *easier to spend* than the bills Banks would want to issue.  That means there is a transactional advantage to using Bitcoin over the notes *with the one exception* of offline transactions.

*Price* inflation is low.  
Monetary inflation (rise in prices due to printing money) != to Price inflation.
Unless you think productivity increases (you know, that thing that drives down computer prices?) has no effect on the price of anything but computers.
Because computers have a magic that allows productivity and technology to lower those prices, that all other goods and services lack.

I see all sorts of flaws in his arguments.  First off, Bitcoin's deflation on the way to adoption is WAY more severe than 66 percent.  Bitcoins in existence today are 11.5 million (see the [counter]( for the exact count updated in real time).  At $112 per Bitcoin as of writing, you are talking about a capitalization of ~1.3 billion.  At full adoption, Bitcoin would need a capitalization of at least a few trillion.  The M2 for dollars is ~11 trillion.  That implies a factor of 1000, or 100,000 percent, not 66 percent.
Once adoption of Bitcoin levels off, then its deflation/inflation will reflect rises or falls in productivity and production.  One would expect deflation of 2 to 3 percent per year as those are the productivity increases we have seen mostly.
Thus yes, a loan in bitcoin for a house before Bitcoin is fully adopted will be disastrous.  On the other hand, nobody will be making loans in Bitcoin as it rises in value and prior to its universal adoption.  During this phase, one merely needs to save modestly for a couple of years and pay cash for your house, with no loan.
After adoption, your 6 percent loan would be 1 to 2 percent.   Instead of setting interest above inflation as done today (4 percent real interest = 6 percent interest - 2 percent inflation), a bank can loan at 1 to 2 percent (4 percent real interest = 1 percent interest + 3 percent deflation) 
The result is much more manageable than the author's scenario.
Seriously, if the author's doomsday predictions were true and factual, you would expect that we could not do banking until 1913.  And that just isn't true.

I like the insistence that people will make and lose money.  I ran the numbers.  Someone bringing home 2000 dollars a year, who bought all in at the beginning of very month, and actually spent a little more than they earned, would come out ahead each year, no matter when they started doing this.
If in 2010, they would have a million dollars or more worth of BTC.  But even 2013, they would have about 5 grand worth of BTC left over.
A currency isn't *supposed* to be an investment.  But it isn't *supposed* to be a pail with holes punched in the bottom either.

How is bitcoin a "public transaction"?  That is to say, the transaction may be public if it is in the blockchain (doesn't have to be), but the parties of the transaction are not.   And it is the parties of a transaction that matter, not the Bitcoin.

Then why talk to me?




1% return is so close to failure, your idea should be discarded.  Any error at all, and you fail.
to furhter make it clearer, using your example of buying houses; if I buy a house and I save 10000$ in rent per year (because I'm not paying rent, I'm living in the house I buy with credit), even if I don't have the savings to buy a house out right (BTW saving for a year or two to buy a house outright? lol)  
Outrageous gains in bitcoin are doing this.  The 9000% gains Bitcoin has logged since the start of the year mean that a mere $10000 in savings as of January 2013 are now worth ~ $900,000.
This kind of explosion in value prevents loans, but vastly rewards savings.  Once deflation falls to 1 to 3 percent, you can clearly make loans.


In the context of Bitcoin, that math isn't necessarily going to work.

Why did the banks vote down an upgrade?  Expensive to do? Hogwash.  Banks have worked and upgraded their software systems repeatedly.  Wire transfers?  Maybe but not likely.  
Fees. Overdrafts, automatic overdraft transfers... By confusing customers over time about their balances, all these mistakes naturally occur.  Real time transfers would make checking your actual balance as easy as looking at it.

Not primarily.  Sans Bitcoin and Sans Credit Cards, how would you make online purchases?  Credit cards are primarily a transaction system.




MasterCard made 1.9 Billion dollars on Transaction fees in Q4 of 2012.  Just because they are not enumerated on most purchases doesn't mean you are not paying them.




Ignoring the fact that you have to actually dispute those charges, and often deactivate your card and wait days for a replacement.  Something I do about once a year with my American Express card.  And I don't use it to buy from shady operations.  But I make lots of purchases.  It only takes one crooked waiter or employee to capture and sell my credit card info....




I am going to give you this one.  The fact that a Bank backs up a Credit Card and charges you a fee is the Bank's doing and has nothing to do with Transaction processing (MasterCard's business).




What are the options on the Internet?  Or anywhere else for that matter.  There are outfits that only take cash (lots of really great BBQ joints in Texas, for example).  But that model doesn't work for everyone, and the costs of Credit Cards get folded into what you pay.  Some places (SPECS in Texas for example, and many Gas Stations) give you money off if you pay cash.  Because it is costing you.




Meh.  Nothing to say here.




Uh.... No.  Laws are not what drive the complaints about PayPal freezing accounts.  Nor is the desire to do illegal things.  For example, Wikileaks isn't breaking any laws at all (Not where they operate from), yet you cannot donate money to them via PayPal.


Debt cards still use Mastercard/Visa and even sometimes AmericanExpress to process transactions.  The term "Credit Card" is not always applied to just those cards backed by a credit account with a bank.
And someone still ends up paying transaction fees if a card is processed through MasterCard/Visa/Amex/etc.

The tweaks are interesting.  Litecoin is more resistant to ASIC and GPU domination.  This is a little thing, but an important thing.
But even if it was a direct clone of Bitcoin, just being a different currency is interesting enough to be competition, if currencies can be said to compete with each other.
To me it seems like an argument that you should not have more than one currency.   Maybe that's true, but we always have had more than one.  So the argument really is why we should only have one currency.  I don't think OP or others make that case very strongly.  
Yes bringing in other currencies may confuse some people.  Heck Bitcoin will confuse some people.  But if they can wave their smart phone at the cashier to buy eggs and milk, they are not really going to care if that was done with Bitcoin or Litecoin.  And as both currencies will eventually level out in value by who is using them, the customer might not care that much where his value is being held.

There are some newsletters that have some (mostly mild) stereotyping but certainly insulting statements towards blacks, gays, and minorities that were published under Ron Paul's name.  He made some significant (though certainly not life changing) money off of them.  
Meanwhile, Obama continues the out and out war on Minorities and the Poor, otherwise known as the "Drug War."  We apply the death penalty mostly along racial lines.  Never mind the questionable tactics that involve blowing people up in countries where we are not a war; that doesn't matter because they are not us, not European, and mostly muslim.  
Of course, Obama might well claim he isn't racist, as he has abused all of our rights under the constitution through the prosecution of whistle blowers, failure to prosecute fraud and abuse by bankers, and the outright blanket spying on American Citizens.  
It seems insulting newsletters are more important to many people than throwing away the lives of so many with harsh drug laws, blowing up children (that are not ours), and the abuse of our rights.

We have had [3 percent productivity increases in the last quarter](


rate during the third quarter of 2013, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics 
reported today. The increase in productivity reflects increases of 4.7 
percent in output and 1.7 percent in hours worked. (All quarterly percent 
changes in this release are seasonally adjusted annual rates.) 
Where are the price reductions from this?  All things being equal, if the cost to produce goods go down, the prices should too.  
Simple Baumol's Cost Disease.  Not all sectors get the same benefit from technology and productivity increases, so the costs of goods and services do not drop at the same rates for all sectors.
Do not be fooled.  The real cost to produce goods and services did fall.  But Monetary inflation and the stickiness of prices work together to keep prices up for the goods and services we use to compute CPI.
And it is this limited set of goods and services (CPI) on which we base the claim that inflation is low. The unspoken assumption is that nobody needs health care (beats inflation) and education (which beats inflation even more).  And the reason these two beat inflation is that technology and productivity do not lower their costs as fast as the stuff you buy at Walmart.


Actually, the money supply, the real supply (M3, which isn't reported by the Fed any longer) hasn't grown.  Lending (as you say) creates the money supply in the economy (best measured by M3), so as long lending is limited, you do not get inflation in prices.  On the other hand, the Federal Reserve is handing out hard assets (cash) for loans (mortgaged back securities), insuring that the next crash doesn't hit the banks (which would sink) but the Federal Reserve (which doesn't care about money;  they print as much as they like, when they want).
Still, the fact is that inflation is higher than we think, and has been for 40 years.  Like a little difference in odds can create a Las Vegas strip, a little constant and persistent inflation wears down the value of savings and wages through the primary Money Illusion (the idea that people accept raises that do not adjust for price inflation) and the secondary Money Illusion (that price inflation == monetary inflation, when it most certainly does not).

Nobody minds lower prices.  So that isn't a problem.  Nobody wants to take a pay cut, or give one.  So the wages of the masses goes up.  Of course, if the prices of goods are going down, then "lower wage" jobs naturally allow people to buy more over time.
Exactly the opposite happens with inflation, and the lower 50 percent of the population simply cannot afford healthcare and education.
Likewise, a truly global monetary system would allow easy comparisons of prices world wide.  That would promote more trade, and promote more prosperity world wide, as those with the least income have their wages gradually raised through the natural progression of technology and progress.




If your money is easily fungible, then it is both.  Keynesians are always pointing out that the numerical count of dollars isn't important, it is the ratio of salary to prices that matter.  It works both ways, you know.


See the tech industry.  For the last 40 years.  Your typical smart phone has more computational power than the original Cray Super Computer.  A multi-million dollar device, for 300 dollars.  Now THAT's deflation!

@_date: 2013-03-29 06:09:33
Some differences. Bitcoin isn't a stock; it is the product AND in some way the investment. Bitcoin replaces a number of multi billion companies. It has no employee cost. It carries very little infrastructure costs. It is way ahead of its competition, but if it loses ground to one, Bitcoin is trivially exchanged into any competitive crypto currency through any of a large number of exchanges (unlike typical currencies). 
So if I assume it can take over some bank functions (secure store of value, returns on savings) and some transaction functions (international wires, online purchases).... All in all a value of &gt; 1000 is not only reasonable, but required. And risk mitigated by possible conversion to any competitor that may take the lead.
But I do agree this rise is too fast. It may correct.
Or it may just level off until greater adoption occurs...
It isn't exactly a bubble, but it may have growing pains. Crypto currencies are the future.

The attributes of a thing that cause us to consider something to have intrinsic value need not be physical attributes.  They just need to be attributes not found in other things that people find useful.

There quickly is a point where the cost doesn't justify the reward.  So it isn't as if Bitcoin would lead to some kind of massive energy sink.  More than enough to keep fraud from the system, but not so much as to be environmentally unsound.
The energy cost of Bitcoin should be put in the context of Bank Vaults, Armored Cars, Secret Service (to prevent and investigate counterfeiting), Courts and police (for arresting and trying counterfeiters and fraud), Jails (for locking up counterfeiters), Identity Theft (since we must trust banks for awkward security), etc.
In Contrast, Bitcoin is secured (or fails to be secured) by simple mathematics.  Secure your private key, and all of that crap just goes away.
There isn't any chance that Bitcoin can burn through the resources required to secure conventional finances...
Case in point, I ran the "Passing Bitcoin Around the World" exercise last month.  9 people in India, Canada, New Zealand, Uruguay, and the US passed a Bitcoin transaction from person to person.  We started with .5 Bitcoin (roughly 66 dollars at the time) and ended up depositing 66 dollars with the One Foundation in China (doing relief work in China after the 7.0 earthquake there in April).  The transaction traversed 10 international boarders and 70,000 miles (three times around the earth) in 1 hour 51 minutes 45 seconds.  the full .5 bitcoin that started ended up with the Charity.
I dare say the same set of transactions using traditional finances would have burned through an enormous number of fees.  It would have required manual steps along the way.  It would have involved mainframes, repeated network messages.  Long paper forms.  Manual review.
There isn't any possible way we could have done this traditionally for the amount of power used in the Bitcoin network to process 11 blocks.  And our work was a minor fraction of those blocks.

So selfish works on a block, finds it, and holds it, starts on next and say gets the next.
Honest is working away, and finds a block
1) Selfish has to publish the one against main AND the next to displace the one Honest found.  If they don't publish the second one, and main completes another block, then their secret chain is dead by 16.1.5 assuming that a transaction in the new block spends an output in the previous block.

Still not on the radar.  Bitcoin will have to be at $10,000 dollars before governments wake up.  At even $1000, this only makes Bitcoin a ~11 Billion dollar market.  To put that into perspective, VISA's revenue (only on transaction fees) is 10 Billion dollars.
At 10,000 Dollars, bitcoin is then a 110 Billion dollar market... Now they are waking up.
But by then two factors hit you.  One is that there is far more ASIC development going on than anyone knows about.  CoinTerra for example still hasn't released much of their projections.  Two or three more companies like that, and even if Governments can drop lots of cash, they can't make up for time they waited.  It still takes six months to develop and deploy these kinds of ASICs, and in that time the market will have moved.

First, we can do something about that.  And I would assume we are.
Second, we have a fix for that too.  As you say.  And it needs to be deployed.
Third, This has to be fixed.  The fix is rather simple.  Larger blocks.  And the current limit is [7 transactions per second](  But it depends on the size of the transactions.  The time required to  sign the block is identical no matter how many transactions are involved.
Fourth, the upgrade path.  Yes, this is an issue.  At least half the cilents have to be upgraded.  But even if you have a hard fork, as long as both forks have the same transactions, the merchants do not care.  Their transactions will be on both path.
Bitcoin isn't perfect. Nothing is.  But these are not shortcomings, but challenges to the system.  We have the test network, and increasingly we have the funds to test and deploy.  Darth Vader was right to warn of pride, but he did lose in the end anyway.

Bitcoin can be done with a Fractional Reserve Bank as long as they do the following:
* Limit withdraws explicitly 
* Pay real interest on deposits (otherwise, why?  Why give them free money?)
* Keep very high reserves (because Bitcoin is useful on its own;  When someone pays someone else, they are going to require Bitcoin)
* Do something VERY attractive to entice people to accept their securities in place of Bitcoin.  What?  I seriously can't imagine. 
The article's theory that people will take and use "Numbers in a Banking system that are as good as Bitcoin" instead of actual Bitcoin is a lie.   Why would they?  The number requires transactions to stay within a creaky, inefficient, insecure, expensive system, while Bitcoin is nearly free, fast and secure.

People never have extra money to spend when they do not save.  What you mean is cheap money to borrow.  But once people have maxed out, they can't spend any more and they can no longer afford even necessities like education and medicine (Which resist cost reductions due to productivity gains more than other goods. See [Baumol's Cost Disease](








Nice.  The point was Income gap.  You have 40 years of Income gap growth since the last ties to the Gold Standard were cut.  Take ANY period forward from 1971 (5, 10, 20, 40 years) and inflation has been HIGHER since 1971 than the period before 1971.  And *shockingly* the income gap grew consistently after 1971 while it was shrinking before 1971.
In the last 100 years under the Federal Reserve, we have only had 12 years with deflation.  Most of those were under the Fed's management of the Great Depression.  Factor in Productivity gains (ignored by CPI) and the Great Depression becomes the only years with deflation.  
Wages for the general population have never significantly and consistently grown in real value under any period dominated by persistent and significant inflation.  Can you demonstrate a counter case?




The high cost of education and medicine are a result of much higher inflation than CPI takes into account.  The fact is the **real costs of producing goods and services has consistently diminished** over the last 40 years. But CPI holds a "Basket of Common Goods" at a constant price.  That skews the scale, making it seem that the inflation rate for Medicine is different and higher, and the inflation rate for Education is different and higher yet.  Again, I refer you to the economic work in the 1960's where Baumol detailed what to expect, that the costs of Education would not fall significantly, that Medicine would have moderate drops in costs, and most other goods and services would drop in cost signficatnly:  [Baumol's Cost Disease](
It was predicted, and it happened.  Only we don't factor in productivity gains in computing CPI.  This is why consistently over my 50 years, every year it seems harder to make ends meet despite the fact that I make 8 X what I made earlier in my career.  The costs of goods isn't the problem.  Trying to save is a problem, getting actual returns on saving is a problem, while the costs of Medical Insurance, Health Care, Education for my kids (vs what I had to pay when I went to college) is increasingly difficult.




Most of those histories are written by bankers (and economists that work for the financial sector).  When you go back and work through the data (As Friedman and Schwartz have done) the Gold Standard didn't do as badly as the bankers claim it did.  And the last 40 years certainly are no testament to the ability of Monetary policy to fairly distribute the rewards of Technology and Productivity fairly.




Actually, after the Great Depression (occurring under the management of monetary policy driven by Central Banks in Europe and the US), the Inflation crisis of the 70's, the explosion of the Income gap in the 80's and the Savings and Loan crash, the Tech Bubble of the 90's, and the housing bubble of 2008, not to mention  the the lists of wars and conflicts financed by printing money, and I think you are hard pressed to claim stability for Central banking.




High inflation promotes investment via borrowing (which must be paid back), and thus promotes disastrous crashes (which we have repeatedly seen).








yeah?  And those are.... ?  What was the huge Tax Cut Nixon passed in the early 70's that reversed the falling of the Income Gap, and how did Carter reinforce them to continue the rise of the Income Gap until Reagan could carry it on?
And even if I give you some other cause for the concentration of wealth in the financial sector who runs monetary policy and directly benefits from direct receipt of freshly minted cash from the Federal Reserve, the most obvious question is to ask: How the income gap is not an economic problem?  And what can the Federal Reserve do to get money to flow to people and not into the pockets of a few?




What are they now?  And what is different now from 1980?

Just an Historical take on an old story:




What we in the West and in Christianity fail to understand in this exchange is that a Jew in this time would never trade with a coin with an image inscribed on it. That is why he had to ask for the coin.  That is why they "brought him a denarius".  Who knows where they got it, but they had to go get one as no good Jew (i.e. a Pharisee or their disciples) would be carrying one.  Why?  Because the Torah is clear in the prohibition of images (particularly anyone claiming to be related to a god):


The point Jesus nearly 2000 years ago was making is simple:  **If you don't like the taxes, don't use the coin** (i.e. "...Render unto Caesar that which is Caesar's ...".
And now people are seeing that as long as one uses fiat, they cannot avoid the rules and regulations of the system.  If one doesn't  like the rules?  Then one should not use the coin of those making those rules.

The macroeconomic observation is that the deflationary aspect of Bitcoin is greater than even gold backed dollars. 
The limited supply of Bitcoin is more limiting for Bitcoin than even for gold, since even gold as currency didn't cut bankers out of transactions.  We preferred banks to hold gold for the security of our money ("take it to the bank") and for easier transactions (sending checks for example).  Bitcoin provides plenty of security by its nature. And Bitcoins are easier to send and more secure to send than banking instruments like checks and wires.
All of this is in the context of how to value Bitcoin based on its monetary base as compared to dollars and its monetary base.  My claim is that you cannot assume Bitcoin's supply can be inflated to the same degree as the supply of the legacy currencies.

So prove how wonderful your credit card is.  Post that information, just like I was a merchant.
I did exactly that for Bitcoin.  If you follow that link, you can actually see 107 transactions, with all the information provided both by the spender, and the receiver of every transaction.
With 77 million on the line, I am sure YOU can break Bitcoin and take at least 1 million.  Because Bitcoin is less secure than Credit Cards.
Because 40 MILLION people just lost control of their credit cards less than a week before Christmas.  Because the Credit Card companies are all saying for people not to worry.  Because there isn't ANY WAY they could replace 40 MILLION cards in time to save Christmas down in Whoville.
No merchant could ever leak that information on Bitcoin.  In fact, every single transaction ever made is just as open as the example I gave you.  The merchant info, and the spender info. 
Bitcoin has its vulnerability.  You have to maintain the private keys.  Nobody said any different. 
You CANNOT make a secure Credit Card transaction.  It is impossible in the USA.  That is why you have fraud protection.  Because to keep the boat afloat, you have to have pumps to keep ship from sinking.

Goods are sold.  It is hard to hide this fact.  And in the case of businesses, they often wish to claim their profits for investors.  And their expenses (i.e. report what you pay employees, and for goods and services).
Really, Bitcoin isn't any better at hiding transactions than cash.  But we don't use cash not so much because there isn't a tax advantage to do so.  But because there is a cash advantage to reporting payments.
Until you get rid of that, Bitcoin really doesn't have an advantage over cash at all.  And only a slight advantage over banking.  In fact, the ledger is a permanent and public record of transactions, making payments easy to track even after years have passed.  So there is a great deal of risk to try and hide transactions, if you are a large corporation.  From there, the cards fall neatly to tracking most tax liabilities.

As the price continues to outpace other options, people will go in for it.
And Bitcoin provides real, tangible advantages over the dollar.  It doesn't lose value over time, even if it does fluctuate.  As more people come on board, it will stabilize.
Obviously this will cause people to save rather than borrow.  They may even borrow dollars to buy Bitcoin.  Why?  Because if they beat the 10 or 20 percent costs of borrowing by buying into Bitcoin, why wouldn't you do that?  And if you can spend Bitcoin, why not even keep balances like your checkbook in an "investment" currency rather than an inflationary currency?
Economists have been studying this.  It is called called Thier's law by Wikipedia.  But it can be stated as, "Good Money drives out Bad Money."

Not entirely accurate you know.  Some cards are debit (not credit) and some are prepaid (not credit).  Credit cards function on the internet as a payment system primarily rather than a system for taking out loans in this context (even if maintaining a balance on a credit card is a common failing )


Neither does MasterCard.  The credit side of a credit card *is always* provided by a bank or other financial entity.  The only thing MasterCard does is process transactions and they make their money on transaction fees.  They make zero on credit.


Banks yes.  Maybe MasterCard, but less certain.


Uh... No.  The ability of Bitcoin to preserve value and support transactions over the internet at lower costs, faster speeds, less risk, less investment required, ultra low barriers to entry, less government and corporate tracking.... All that means fewer Bitcoins deposited in banks for free that they can leverage for gains.  And no"lender of last resort" with infinitely deep pockets.
So while banks can make money on Bitcoin, they are even more restrained by Bitcoin than they were under the gold standard in the 1800's.


PayPal is afforded escrow powers with the banking system far greater than Bitcoin allows.  PayPal thus provides for customer protections as well as enabling certain fraudulent buyers.  
Further, PayPal's primary service is to avoid giving credit card information to everyone you purchase from on the internet.  (I've used them for at least ten years and I have never had to have them refund a purchase). But I have used PayPal to avoid giving credit card info to people on eBay even before eBay bought and integrated PayPal into their platform.
I can pay anyone a Bitcoin without any worries at all of exposing myself to someone stealing my Bitcoin address and making fraudulent purchases... Because that isn't possible.  I have to worry anytime I use MasterCard, because their system requires me to expose myself to fraud and theft with every ... single ... transaction!  No wonder they tout "Customer Protections."  You would be an idiot to use a credit card with out them.  Remove most of the risk involved in transactions, and guess what?  "Customer Protections" are not so critical anymore.

You again demonstrate your failure to understand Bitcoin.  What you are saying about the exchanges and identification is true.  But the connection of exchanges to bitcoin addresses is not.  
When your BTC is in an exchange, you do not have a Bitcoin Address. You don't have a bank account holding your USD either. You are using their centralized servers to buy and sell currencies on their centralized systems.  When you withdraw OUT of the exchange, THEN you have a bitcoin address.
And nothing prevents you from moving BTC from your bitcoin address as you like, and very rapidly the connection to you is obfuscated in the Blockchain.


The dollar cannot be regulated, and nor can Bitcoin.  This is a fallacy bandied about by people who are ignoring the facts.  The fact is that we have a 300 billion dollar illicit economy in dollars today in the USA alone.  World wide this economy is over a trillion dollars.  This is largely enabled because cash cannot be traced.  Bitcoin cannot be traced outside exchanges and reporting businesses either.




You don't have to be a hypocrite, and you do not have to "know" the Truth.  The Truth (as you say, not the truth) is an unknowable thing.  Accept that, and do what you can, be what you can be.

Gresham's law does not apply because there are no fixed by government exchange rates with Bitcoin. The corollary applies instead:
Thier's law: good money drives out bad when the exchange rates between currencies is not fixed.
Point: do you want to be paid in a currency that holds or gains value? Or one by design or policy loses value?
The key is easy exchange between currencies and market driven exchange rates. Bitcoin had the later, and is developing the former.

If you bought 10 dollars of BTC each day for the last year, you would be whales ahead of the game.  I am pretty certain that the same will be true next year, and the next.
I also believe the price of Bitcoin will stabilize over time.  While the price is so low (and it is low relative to is value as an international exchange of value), its price will be subject to huge swings.  I'd guess that BTC will not be stable until its value has risen by a few more orders of magnitude.  
Others have said this before, but I will repeat it.  Bitcoin will go through five to ten bubbles before it reaches its sustained value.  So far we have seen two.

Your wallet.dat file is basically the private keys to your accounts.  If you are using Armory, then they use deterministically generated keys.  That means that if you have the base key backed up, you don't have to worry about backing up keys you generate later.  They can be re-generated from your base key.
Take your backup key and secure it.  Then use armory as you like, and you don't have to back it up again as long as you secure that one back up.  This doesn't work on all wallets.
Yes you can use your wallet.dat file on multiple computers.  Not necessarily a great idea, but you can do it.  The balances to your accounts don't have to be backed up.  It doesn't even make sense to talk about backing up your "balance".  That is kept in the Bitcoin network.  All you need is your private keys, and those are in your wallet.dat file.  With those keys, any wallet program can spend the money in your accounts.

An alt coin is a torrent for money.  Distributed systems can't be shut down.  Published is published.  Which is why he complied.  What is there to gain by fighting a fight you have already won?




No torrent developer has ever been jailed or even charged.  So not the same thing.




So. The UN estimates the illicit market (drugs, child porn, prostitution, etc) in the USA at over 300 billion per year.  So where does that money come from if not from the banks?  The government intercepts less than 2 billion of that, not even one percent.
AML/KYC  is the very definition of "shits and giggles".  It is theater, not an effective mechanism to track transactions.




Yes and no.  We don't have tons of privacy.  But there are limits in the constitution for limiting privacy.  You cannot pass the laws needed to prevent privacy.  Hence the demonizing. And the regulation of business (which doesn't have those same rights).  Torrents can't be stopped because the are run by individuals, not businesses. You can't limit what programs an individual writes, an individual installs, and an  individual runs unless there is zero legitimate uses of said program.


Charges in court require proof of guilt in the USA, not proof of innocence.  You still have to have a legal basis to charge someone.  That is why FinCEN gave the use of Bitcoin by customers and merchants the green light back in March.  They can't restrict barter in the USA.  They can't outlaw private transactions between individuals.

The Problem with Fractional Reserve Banking with Bitcoin is that whatever is issued (bank balances, checks, credit cards, whatever) is harder and more expensive to spend than Bitcoin itself.
What banks could do is issue their own digital currency, call it BankCoin, backed by Bitcoin.  However, why would anyone take the BankCoin at face value?  BankCoin will be just as easy to trade as Bitcoin, so people will immediately discount BankCoin, preferring balances in Bitcoin.
The reason fractional reserve banking works with dollars and Gold is that the actual handling of dollars and Gold physically is too hard, expensive, insecure.  Financial institutions are happy with handing each other securities.  Account balances are just displayed to the customer (they are not really there in full).  And we are happy with this because these fictional account numbers are easier to transact.
Anyway, I think Bitcoin can be fractionalized to some level, just not to the same level as dollars and gold can be.  Very fast in person transactions might be one place fractionalization can leverage.  But the meat of transactions, i.e. large purchases like housing, education, medicine, B2B... none of that is helped by leveraging a huge, expensive 3rd party like a Bank handing out fractionalized notes.  
**tl;dr:** Bitcoin can be fractionalized, perhaps in the domain of face to face transactions.  But by no means could the Bitcoin supply be expanded by factors like 10x as some have asserted.

And I see nothing there that says she is prosecuting everyone.  That she is against anyone because she doesn't like them for some reason.  There is everything to indicate that she would go after corporate "Deep Pockets" to force them to pay their share.  Corporations that in many ways have abused the system, received benefits from the system, but haven't paid their employees, haven't paid their taxes.
A company with reasonable profit margins and pay their taxes (which frankly is almost always true of small business), they just are not in that group.

Bitcoin has gone up in value for the entire foot yays of its existence 9 days for every day it has fallen in value, and netted a 10x gain roughly every year.... 
How will people come to value dollars more when by design people cannot, as central banks and banks inflate dollars? And how can people come to value Bitcoin less even as by design bitcoin are easily and inexpensively exchanged and secured, and  by design Bitcoin cannot be inflated significantly?

Not really.  Because in a perfect world where money is a store of value, you do not have to "invest" to maintain value.  Only to increase your value.  Your description was accurate in the sense of immediate use of all money (because it will degrade on you if you don't).  You would force investment (largely through the financial sector, which is good for them) just to maintain value over time.


Yes, but prices are set by the money in play, not the total store.  So as long as you can easily appreciate your currency (and Bitcoin allows this) you never have liquidity problems.  Money just becomes more valuable until money on the sidelines is enticed into the market.  
And when money appreciates in value, what happens is an effect equivalent of distributing value to everyone holding money.  Just like Inflation is in effect the equivalent of diminishing value of everyone holding money.  But unlike our central bank system where money then is "Printed" and handed to Banks at rates denied everyone else, with Bitcoin "money" just rises in value and the distribution of "new value" isn't concentrated in one place.   It applies itself to all Bitcoin equally.

I have a few observations to make about some things in your analysis, so let me go over a few of them.
I will reference this [graph of technology adoption](
First let's define "adoption" to be over 50 percent.  You could pick any number, but over 50 percent and all technologies begin to level off (some at higher points, but none in this list at lower points).  This is arbitrary, but it is useful for Bitcoin as there isn't any currency in primary use by 50 percent of the world's population.  So 50 percent of the population using Bitcoin would be unprecedented. 
* Number 1:  Technology Adoption is speeding up. Consider Old vs New:
 * Old: AM Radio ~10 years
 * Old: Telephone ~50 years
 * Old: Electricity ~20 years
 * Old: Refrigerator ~20 years
 * New: VCR ~10 years
 * New: Computer ~15 years
 * New: Cell phone ~10 years
 * New: Internet ~10 years
This puts Bitcoin in 50 percent of the population using currency in no more than 10 years.  Maybe less. 
* Rate of growth  138 dollars per month.
As others have pointed out, the rate of growth will be logarithmic, as all other technology adoptions have been. 
* Adoption curves.
They do not start out steep and become shallow.  They start out shallow and become steep.  We are in the shallow part of the curve.  Only after about 70 percent adoption will the curve flatten out.  And some very useful tech (microwaves, Internet, Cellphones, Color TVs) don't flatten out until 80 percent or more.
I see the adoption to 50 percent for Bitcoin as being more like a Microwave or the Internet than I do the telephone or the dishwasher.  Bitcoin provides the following irresistible qualities:
* Frictionless global transactions.
 * [Remittance is roughly 534 billion.](
 * [Offshore accounts hold upto 32 trillion](
 * Growth of online commerce
Once 50 percent of the population is holding Bitcoins in the USA, you are talking about Bitcoin being held by 60 million households.  
Lastly, if Bitcoin's advantages for many common transactions and wealth holding functions come into play, then much of the wealth currently held in deflationary instruments will rapidly flow out of banks and into Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.  The economic gyrations that will result are terribly difficult to imagine.  It is possible that many standard currencies will resort to gold and assets to steady themselves.
At this point in my writing, I am out of time.  And I find that I really am not sure how the forces involved in the economy are going to play out.  What is going to give, and when.
But I don't think we are in for a steady growth for Bitcoin.  I think we are going to see a tipping point and a rapid adoption.  But only time will tell.

The blockchain doesn't need to be parallelized.  That isn't the bottle neck.
* mining a block only requires hashing the result of the merkle tree.
* the validation of transactions can be processed in parallel.
* computing a merkle tree can be parallelized.
* multiple branches doesn't eliminate the need for all transactions to be accessible for all verifications. 
Off chain transactions are really the key longterm.  And blockchain pruning.
I am not sure what you do about bandwidth for transaction publishing otherwise.

With Bitcoin, I can take my BTC off their systems, and pass it around without any more auditing than I allow myself.  See PassingBitcoin.com
That isn't possible with dollars and the current financial systems.

Not zero in 1930. This is the same data graphed in the previous link. 


Of course this isn't M2. This is the graph of the Money Base (MB). And it is for the entire federal reserve system, not just the St. Louis Fed.


You can always treat a small enough section of any curve as linear. Not the same thing as claiming the process you are looking at is linear. That's why you want to look at as much data as you can to understand what is going on.
And if you adjust a data set by applying a correction which is itself an exponential function (inflation), you might be able to get a (more) linear data set, but what would that tell you?  Heck I already did that by plotting the data on a log scale!
The fact is that our monetary policy over the best data we have shows an exponential growth in every measure, the monetary base, the M1, M2, M3, etc. 
And yes, if you don't look at all the data, you can pretend this isn't true. But good analysis isn't about pretending.

For point of sale of small transaction amounts, you really do not need to wait for any confirmations, just the transaction notification.

I think you would have a point **IF** there was some significant advantage to dollars for day to day spending.
What is it?  The ability to hold (even briefly) a currency losing value?  To use credit cards that charge large fees and are inherently insecure?  The inability to pay anyone directly who isn't physically next to you while you also happen to have the cash to make the payment?
Bitcoin needs an offline implementation, and it needs really fast POS transactions.  Which I think it will have in a year or two.  We already have implementations of both. But I see no advantage to dollars.
Other than to take out loans.  Then its natural inflation works in my favor.  But when that is all anyone wants to do, how can banks make loans in dollars when everyone wants to hold and wants to be paid in Bitcoin?

Secondly, the Bitcoin ecosystem is valued at over 3 billion, and there is no company.  They didn't raise any money, and they don't pay back to investors for its development costs. Bitcoin is open source (with more than 7 independent implementations of the protocol).  It is a truly international platform with significant players on all the populated continents. 
Lastly, eBay is about 69 billion 14+ years later, a little over 2x.  Largely because the first price was a Tech Bubble price, but mostly because it reached most of its potential in about that time.
Bitcoin hasn't come close to reaching its potential, in my opinion.  Nor in the opinion of many people much smarter than myself.
It may yet crash.  But it would be foolish to dismiss Bitcoin.  You very rarely see truly disruptive technologies arise and transform the world, but I'd claim Bitcoin is one.  Bitcoin and/or some cryptocurrency is going to drastically change the world.

This is why we don't use cars, but horse and buggies.  Why etickets failed for Airline Travel.  Why nobody banks online.  Why the Post Office is still the hub of written communication.  Why the three networks, CBS, ABC, and NBC are still about the only three channels on T.V. anybody watches.  Why Saturday morning cartoons still capture the imagination of the young across America.  
Because the existing infrastructure and the fact that everyone knows how to use the existing infrastructure is so established, change cannot happen.  Imperfect systems that require tweaking as the population begins to use them always fail.  ATMs used to be deployed in locked buildings in the middle of parking lots.  And they took your Debit card if you miss keyed your pin number twice, and sometimes even once!  These things were never fixed.
I could go on, but seriously. Is there even one point here that is beyond the ability of the Bitcoin Network to address?
And let's drop the environmental waste cannard.  The Bitcoin network can process any number of transactions with the same computational power applied.  The waste of building banks, ATMs, Cash Registers, Identity Theft, Credit Card Theft, Counterfeiting, Vaults, Separate computer systems for VISA, MasterCard, American Express, Discover, Western Union, each major Bank, all the Savings and Loans....

You didn't read anything on Braumol's cost disease, I don't think.  The point is that the *real cost* of education has gone down.  The number of hours of labor and resources required to educate is less.  We have computers.  We have cheaper energy.  We have better publishing, better research tools.  All this lowers (though not by much) the real costs of education.
As someone that went to college in the 70's and paid for college for my kids, I know it does not *appear* that the costs of education have fallen.  That is because the inflation rate doesn't measure *the real cost of producing products*.  It assumes no matter how cheap a "basket of goods" becomes to produce, we as consumers should still pay the same amount for said "basket of goods".  
Hence inflation is under stated, and costs  of other services (medicine and education) seem increasingly expensive.

1) store of value is an adoption driver
2) if people want Bitcoin for its value, they will want to be paid in BTC and take BTC for payment.  Both are less overhead than exchanges.
3) if the desire for BTC lags, its value will fall (the currency will be less deflationary and prices will rise).  People will spend it to divest, and merchants will eye the larger body of customers, and sell to them (they can always use Bitpay to put dollars into their accounts).
4) if the desire for BTC increases, its value will rise, those holding it will feel more wealthy, and will spend, and more people will want to take BTC as payment.
5) dollars are increasingly undesirable if their value consistently falls, and something else is rising in value and is increasingly as easy to spend.  Thier's law.  Good money drives out bad when their exchange rate isn't fixed.

It really isn't that hard.
If you started saving $10 a day by buying Bitcoin and stashing it away in your wallet, then what would the value of those savings be today?
What kind of return on the total amount you contributed would you have today?  The first graph shows that the earlier you started saving, the bigger your total returns would be today.  For example, if you had started on April 1st, today you would have a return on your savings of about 47 or 48 percent (in dollars).
Looking on the second graph, you can read off the value of your Bitcoin savings for any given start date.  If you had started the plan on April 1st, you would have about $3000 dollars worth of Bitcoin, but you would have contributed only $2000 dollars to the plan.  That's a 50 percent return.
As you move closer to today's date to start your savings, your returns are less and your balance is pretty much what you put into it.  But even if you only started on October 1st, your savings plan would have returned a little short of 20 percent. (see graph 1).  The second graph isn't so useful near the present date, as there isn't enough resolution to see your gains for smaller amounts.

Test coin support is built into most code bases.  So it is a simple configuration switch to swap between the real network and the test network.  Only the test network tends to be slow since mining on it is pretty useless.  Still when errors can cause real Bitcoin to be lost forever, it makes sense to do initial testing on the rest network.

Wages are sticky.  Paul Krugman makes a big point about inflation as a means of lowering the cost to produce goods by reducing real wages and costs (such as the value of debts owed). (In his discussion about Spain in his book "End this Depression Now").  He has also clearly indicated that deflation raises wages, making products more expensive to produce.  I say this to point out that inflation removes value from savings (often loaned and thus devalued), and wages.  People are forced to borrow for common purchases, not just to start businesses or buy homes.  It is this I find inefficient.  


At best, inflation does nothing good for the majority of people.  At worst, inflation provides just a percent or two advantage to the richest.  And remember that Las Vegas was built on such a slight advantage.  A small bias over a long period of time can have massive effects.
Bitcoin cannot fix the world.  But it may very well make an argument against manipulation of currency and commodity pricing that otherwise is too easily ignored.

Close. Everyone is subject to criticism for their actions. In as much as Israel is an identifiable group that literally acts in this world, and the same for bankers, then your contention is, well, off base. 


No. It is an observation that these groups of people are not involved. Besides, race isn't a group that make decisions and take actions. You are instead blaming a class of people for behaviors of smaller groups that can be defined more accurately another way. Like blaming blacks or Mexicans for the actions of gangs. Or Jews for the actions of bankers or Israel. It doesn't work the other way. 
Blaming gangs for violence they commit isn't racist. Not blaming Israel or bankers for violence and economic crimes.

IF bitcoin would expand the scripting just a little bit, you could in fact create an output that would:
* 1) Check the conformations on itself, and if greater than some number (say 144 ~= 24 hours) then proceed
* 2) Create one spendable output of no more than 10 BTC (or some other limit).
* 3) The second output must be spendable with exactly the same script as self.
This would pretty much do the trick.  But the scripting in Bitcoin isn't that flexible.  Best that I know, you can't push the number of confirmations on your input.  And you cannot compare an output script against your own.
But it would be a neat little upgrade to the protocol...

The income gap demonstrates that the majority isn't winning.  They are losing.  Bankers have lots of money. So do lots of corporations. They don't give up that money because, well, it's theirs.  And it's their former executives that run the federal reserve, and it is back to banks and corporations federal reserve officials go when they leave the Fed.
The federal reserve isn't a charity. They justify actions based on the common good, but there isn't any proof that they have done much for the common good.

You can only obtain linear savings, against exponential transaction growth. That's if you even get any savings...


I have no idea what your model really is. Are addresses fixed to a fork?  Do all nodes handle all forks? An output of a transaction could go anywhere.  A transaction can have many outputs.  If you have to have all the chains, you get no savings at all.

Gold isn't really "divisible" (really the term is fungible).  How can you buy a $1 coke when Gold is 1300+ dollars per ounce?  Certainly you can divide Gold into 1/1300 ounce chunks, but those are not usable in transactions with actual people in the actual market place.
And that extreme value forces the market to use gold representations rather than gold directly.  A tiny bit of gold in a coin (trust us!  It really has the gold in it we claim!).  Or paper certificates that are "as good as gold!"  Now we are back to fractional reserve banking.
Another comment pointed out that Gold cannot be transacted over distance.  Now you are back to banks and 3rd parties to negotiate transactions!  
And Gold is subject to unpredictable inflation.  Like the new Gold mine found in China.  Or Gold from Asteroids. Or some new process to separate Gold out of sea water.  And if it became the standard again, it would shoot up in value, making terribly environmentally abusive processes worth the money.
Of course if the world comes to an end, and we have no Internet, certainly you will have your gold, and my Bitcoin will evaporate.  Of course, so will 90 percent of the population (which depends on the same infrastructure to supply food and water).  So given the odds of quick death vs terrible quality of life, well, I don't think holding gold is going to matter all that much.  Amazingly simple things like a Solar Cell to charge a small computer become way more valuable than Gold, which is just a pretty lump of metal.

Of course, Bitcoin doesn't really exist in a location. It is all in the blockchain, both before and after the transaction, so it doesn't really move.








They explicitly say miners can by stuff and not be money transmitters, but they can't exchange Bitcoin for cash. If they have to be registered exchangers, how does that work? They have zero information that exchangers are required to report. Mining would have to be flat out illegal, in the US anyway. Which would be stupid.

My last remark on this.
Israel deserves loads of criticism.  Loads of it.  And piling on to Israel over what they do is justified just because they are a country.  The USA deserves criticism too.  For the same reason.  "International bankers" are so corrupt that most should be thrown into jail yesterday if not several years before.  But they own the governments and the corporations, and their finger is over the "Kill the World Economy Dead" button, so they are untouched.
Just because Jews exist doesn't mean laying into them and bankers is a racial slur.  **It is insulting to blacks and mexicans to compare them to international bankers**.  Blacks and Mexicans have done nothing at all to wreck the economy and destroy people's lives in the developing world in the fashion that Israel has done and International bankers have done.  Well, unless they too are International Bankers.  I am sure some are, just not that many get into the "Rich White Developed World Banker Club".
I like blacks, and I like Mexicans.  I have close friends that are both.  And I have Jewish friends (most of which share my disgust of what Israel has been doing).  I am a old white guy myself.  I don't know any banker executives personally.
You want to go cry about racism, that's just fine.  Have a party. But I guess if speaking out against injustice by bankers and Israel is racist, then I guess I am racist.  You can add me to your list of racists who don't like Israel's treatment of arabs under their control, and who don't like bankers destroying the economy and blockading whole peoples at the whim of particular governments.

Not really.  All that Bitcoin provides you is the way to "pay cash" on the Internet.  With all the pros and cons of paying cash.  You can't take back a cash payment either.  But banking systems are a layer on top of cash.  They can certainly layer on top of Bitcoin too.
Anyone can escrow a payment for a time period.  Obviously payment can be delayed by a third party until product is received.  Now would Bitcoin allow a payment to be reversed 180 days after the fact?  No.  But if a payment processor is handling the business for a company, and a user is using them for the very idea that their purchase will be protected, then certainly that 3rd party could withhold some amount out of a current payment to pay back the customer.  And if they have permissions to do so, they could extract Bitcoin from a bank handling a business' account too.
We are not there yet, but CoinBase and BitPay are coming on fast.
Keep in mind, it took over 30 years before credit cards reached their current volumes.  It will take far less for Bitcoin.

What is best for Bitcoin is a total market evaluation of hundreds of billions of dollars.  Say 500.
Why?  Because at that level institutional investors can get into the market.  If any entity wanted to put a billion into Bitcoin, or take out a billion, the moves would  upend the market today at ~2.3 billion
At 500 billion,  the market could take such a move without a huge reaction.
That is Bitcoin at 40,000 or 50,000.   That is where Bitcoin then can begin  to attract the real stores of value.... Bank reserves, off shore  accounts, corporate war chests... Which is why "stability" I.e. slow growth is so far away, and why the 10x power year we are getting will continue to persist... And that is good for Bitcoin.

**tl;dr:**The argument that miners will choose higher fees even if that destroys the utility of Bitcoin isn't rational.  And any pool that holds a 5 percent stake in the utility of Bitcoin would not be acting in its own best interest by destroying Bitcoin utility.
The question that matters is... Is any pool doing this?
Your math isn't quite right, but better than mine.  You are right that the 51 percent doesn't matter.  Replace-by-fee allows a second transaction to replace the first in order to collect a higher fee on a later transaction. 
At first blush, it does seem that 5% of the network implementing Replace-by-fee should result in a 5% success rate in retracting a payment in a POS situation.  But the success rate is going to be lower.  Significantly lower.
The higher fee has to be submitted after the merchant had been fooled,  as merchants would certainly monitor pools with  replace by fee polices. (At least I would expect this, and an attacker has to assume the worst) Any indication that a second transaction is out competing with a POS transaction should result in a rejection of the sale.  And perhaps a charge for attempted theft.  So the attacker cannot submit the replacement transaction right away.
So if the attacker gives themselves 2 minutes to get out of the store with the goods, the odds of a 5% mining pool winning with the higher fee are reduced 20% (assuming 10 minutes to the next block) since the rest of the network (including nodes that implement replace-by-fee) had a two minute  head start mining with the transaction with the lower fee, and once the lower fee is in a block, the gig is up.
If you note that on average you are five minutes away from the next block, your odds of winning a replacement are cut in half (depending on how fast new transactions are folded into the blocks being hashed) If you need more than 2 minutes to get away with your free lunch, your odds are further reduced.  
So realistically, your chance of success is no more than 2.5 percent, and maybe less (when we average 6 minutes per block) even with 5% of the network implementing replace-by-fee.
Lastly, doing something that risks criminal penalties that can be detected *every time you try* but only succeeds once every 20 to 40 tries... or maybe not more than 1 out of 100... That doesn't sound like a good scam. High risk of being caught, and low chance of success. And if few try the scam,  then if replace-by-fee is considered bad for Bitcoin, why would a mining pool reduce the value of Bitcoin, thus reduce all transactions, all for something that doesn't produce much additional revenue, and doesn't have much if any legitimate purpose?
So the question comes back to this. How many nodes are doing this?

I am going to drop discussions about Truth... You are too metaphysical in your approach for me to follow, and what I do follow of what you are saying, I disagree with you.  And we are not going to resolve it here.
To focus on the point of the thread...
Exchanges can only know what comes into them, report what goes on in the exchange, and what is transferred out.  This is no different than exchanges we have had for hundreds of years.
Outside the exchange, your connection to a Bitcoin is lost.  Those getting rewards from mining are never identified.  
I find your references to a "Satoshi fairy tale" amusing, since we are having a more or less technical conversation.  Bitcoin is decentralized, and that is a fact.  That is its architecture.  The financial institutions *could possibly* work within a Bitcoin world, but their ability to skim the entire economy for profit would be nearly eliminated.  That would be disastrous for their institutions, but wouldn't harm the economy much at all.

You have to love the income gap!  After all, why should we want people to be able to save for their education or retirement or afford to invest or afford healthcare when we can raise corporate profits and executive pay and fight wars instead?




In what universe does this make any sense?   Engineers don't call any separate measurements "functionally the same" unless there is data or mathematical proof they are.  In this case, you have hard and fast evidence they are not.
Yet more proof economics isn't science, and would be best classified as religious studies.


How is CPI calculated?  It obviously assumes real prices of goods and services should not fall, and excludes goods and services that would disrupt the "story" economists would wish to tell.  Process such as healthcare, education, and technology.  
We have productivity numbers.  Why not claim if productivity has risen 3 percent, and prices 1 percent, that monetary inflation has actually raised prices 4 percent?  After all, that's a better adjustment for "real wages" than claiming inflation is only 1 percent.
Basic point: Why should we assume prices shouldn't fall if productivity is making the real cost of producing goods and services fall?  That wouldn't be deflation.  Not unless you think the technology sector is "suffering" deflation.

Actually, large transactions with established companies makes the argument for Bitcoin.  They are not going anywhere, and you don't need a credit card company or bank to sue a car company for fraud.
In fact, your bank and credit card company are useless in negotiating a dispute with a car company.
And for a large item, you may wish to SAVE rather than to BORROW.   Had you started saving 100 dollars a paycheck in Bitcoin over the last six months, you could now buy a couple of brand new BMWs.  Or you could buy a used car, and pay your 100 dollars a paycheck for the next five years.

I think what you are saying is that if you have a system where individuals and businesses can maintain value through savings, then they may simply not provide that capital where it is needed.  But doesn't that assume it isn't needed *where it already is*?  And in fact, inflation forces a transfer of value away from businesses and individuals regardless of how much utility it might have where it is.


Not really.  [Wages are sticky.](  With deflation wages rise in real value, just like inflation depresses the real value of wages.  So while it may be mathematically the same, it isn't the same in practice.  Also, with deflation, there is no overhead (you don't need a central bank to distribute the new value).  It just happens.  With Inflation, someone has to receive the value you are creating as you inflate the money supply.
And any Casino will tell you, even odds are bad for the house.  You have to have an advantage.  A Central bank has an advantage, where deflation provides even odds to all comers.  It isn't about who has more money.  It is about giving even odds to all players.

Saving is bad for the financial sector, not for the economy.  We have the most productive economy today in the history of mankind (in terms of production of goods and services per worker) than we have ever had.  But under a system of constant and persistent inflation, we have the greatest Income Gap ever as well.  Labor intensive services such as Education and Medicine are increasingly out of reach of the population not because they are really more expensive.  They are out of reach because CPI doesn't take productivity into account, and thus underestimates the inflation rate.
Basically, an inflexible money supply (like a Gold Standard) can be modeled by a balloon, where the economy is the air within that balloon.  Your share of money is a little square on the surface of that balloon, and as the economy grows, your money must grow in value to continue to denominate transactions in a larger economy.  Your added wealth then allows you to save for your own needs, without resorting to risky investments, and often without resorting to loans.  And collectively the population ends up controlling more wealth (since collectively they have more surface of the balloon, which grows as the economy grows).  
But central banks get to mess with that.  They get to "add rubber" to the balloon as the economy grows, and instead of your square growing, they add rubber at such a rate that the area of your square shrinks over time.  In fact, they add so much that the area held by most of the population shrinks over time!  The new rubber added is owned and controlled by a very few individuals, and is lent (at interest) to the rest of the population, further impoverishing their holdings.  The short term gain is a bit more economic activity (because through cheap loans the population can use more surface area to buy goods and services), but eventually the loans have to be paid back.  When they can't, defaults occur, effectively removing rubber from the balloon.  This then creates "deflation."  But deflation occurs uniformly over the surface which (now) is largely the loans of printed rubber, causing more defaults and removing more rubber from the balloon.
The problem then with deflation is not intrinsic to deflation, but it is intrinsic to a money supply created by debt.  Deflation in an economy owned by the population with very little debt isn't really a problem, as we used to see under inflexible money supplies (such as the Gold Standard).  In that case, deflation does not increase the burden of loans so much (as they are not that much of the surface area) but rather gives the population more resources in the form of more value for the money they control.  And since they have more real wealth, they can spend more in the economy, and thus support the growth of the economy without resorting to loans.
Now while my Balloon analogy is just an analogy, and reasoning by analogy is risky, the analogy holds up pretty well.  Inflation is generally associated with increasing income gaps, and we have suffered larger and larger income gaps for 40 years, starting with Nixon's executive order cutting off the Federal Reserve from the constraints of the last ties to the Gold Standard.  
I would claim that there is nothing magic about the gold standard.  It just used to limit the money central banks could print.  They could, in theory, restrain themselves without such limits, especially at times when printing money wasn't necessary.  But as the Federal Reserve is run by Bankers, and cheap money is in their short term interests, they cannot help but serve it up, then justify it via arguments like your own.  
  
@_date: 2013-03-11 17:53:01
Don't believe CPI numbers!  That is always a mistake.
CPI assumes you should spend as much for a product (like a plate or dishwasher) today as you did 10 years ago, 20 years ago, 40 years ago, etc.
CPI does not factor in the fact that the real cost of producing a dishwasher or a plate has fallen dramatically over the last 10 years, 20 years, 40 years, etc.
There are many criticisms of CPI out there, but the one you rarely see, and in my mind is the most important one, is that we do not factor productivity and technology into CPI.  
If you want to get an estimate on the real inflation rate, use something that resists productivity increases with technology.   Like education.  Kids only learn so fast, they require teachers, they take up the same space in a class room.  Computers don't really accelerate learning all that much, and whatever advances we have are offset by larger bodies of knowledge that we have to make kids learn.  So what am I saying?  I am saying Education costs *have not been rising*.  Education costs *have been flat, in real value*.  What has gone down is the value of our money, and thus our wages, savings increasingly cannot afford education.
See [Baumol's cost disease](  This is a result of technology that was predicted 50 years ago, and played out just as predicted.  Only 50 years ago Baumol and company didn't predict that all the productivity gains over the last 40 years would go to the rich, and we would use CPI to pretend wages have been flat.

@_date: 2013-12-02 04:45:19
Okay, let's see how this works. 




Actually, a real return is important to anyone lending money.  Why lend money at a real loss if you can choose some other investment and get a real return?  
A 1 Percent loan is nothing, and doesn't exist in the real world.  There are hardly any loans at 1 percent over inflation unless firmly backed by real estate or other asset, limiting the prospect of loss to near zero.


I have been through the investment cycle many times.  Companies have optimistic projections that investors discount by some factor.  It is in the end all about guess work, and the track record of those behind the company tend to be more trusted than the actual analysis provided by a company seeking investment. 




Wealth creation is far more complex than hard assets like businesses and housing.  It also includes stock evaluations, derivatives, hedge funds, etc.  This is why trillions of dollars of "wealth" were destroyed in 2008.... It wasn't the destruction of real assets that did that, but paper assets and leveraged positions.


The economy cannot sell more than it produces, and in fact cannot sell everything that it in fact does produce.  There is ALWAYS loss.  
And demand follows the supply.  You can nearly always approach 100 percent sells of most products if you price them appropriately.  Though you cannot always make money doing so.


1) I don't remember your 2nd point.  So no.  I don't concede. I'll look it up later.
2) You always wish to increase productivity (where productivity is defined as product or services produced per employee or dollar invested, as is normal).  You do not always wish to increase output.  So an increase in productivity means you can reduce the number of workers.  Or the amount of raw material required.  Or the energy to produce your goods.  Anything that lowers the cost to produce a good or service.  




Credit from banks is more important when wages and savings are being devalued through inflation.  Obviously if you have mild deflation, the real buying power of wages and savings are increasing, creating less demand for loans.  Where Bitcoin is increasing hugely in value (i.e. hyper deflation, though Bitcoin may be the only example ever of hyper deflation in a currency not driving by massive defaults on debt), then loans to buy things like houses don't make sense.  Better to invest what you can in Bitcoin, and wait it out.  Bitcoin has gone up by +32965.93% in the last 2 years.  Why wouldn't you invest one or two thousand in Bitcoin and buy your house out right in two years?  That would be better than a loan for 30.


I kinda agree that we have lost the thread.  I think that investment in solid business ventures (with way better returns than 1% mostly) will always attract investment.  But I also believe we are moving towards a "hard currency" world, perhaps Bitcoin driven, that will replace the debt based monetary system of today.  
Loans will not be as critical in that world.  People will have more wealth, and leveraged deals much harder to make.

Bitcoin provides a number of features that, well, yes.  It does address at least some of the ills of the finance industry:
* You don't have to trust a bank to hold your accounts.
* Banks holding Bitcoin can be publicly audited by just knowing their Bitcoin Addresses.  They claim they have X in assets, well, they can easily prove (or fail to prove) it.
* Bitcoin is the only commodity in existence which can be easily traded globally directly.  You don't need (or likely even want) notes that "represent" your ownership.
* Because the blockchain is public, rigging might be possible, but it is also hard to hide, should the government choose to prosecute for rigging.
How do you rig a transparent system?  The reason most markets are rigged today is because they are not transparent.  Regulation is worthless without transparency.

What Baumol does not consider (being a Progressive) is that the solution to the income gap is not so much progressive government polices, but the reduction of the role of the financial sector in the economy.
Look at this from another perspective.  Supply and demand do set prices.  IF we all have lots of money, but not many products, THEN prices rise.  IF we have very little money, but many products, THEN prices fall.  This is all very basic.
What makes us as a population wealthy is that we produce more goods and services per person, and that we distribute them fairly.  Today we increasingly produce more goods and services per person, and do not distribute them fairly.
We can pay a large segment of the population to "oversee" the production of goods and services, but that cuts our wealth.  Because people not producing goods and services (much of finance) are not actually contributing to the real wealth. And we can pay a large segment of the population to redistribute the production of goods and services. Regulations, tax systems, monetary systems do not produce goods and services.  People involved with them do not produce goods and services. Allocating resources to redistribution not only cuts our wealth, but requires us to trust the process.
There is little reason to trust the process, or those in charge of the process.

Not exactly clear how that would work.  Isn't a short a promise to provide Bitcoin at a later date for a lower price?  Then are they not obligated to buy Bitcoin at that later date at whatever price they must to meet their obligation?
Should the demand for Bitcoin continue (even at half its current frenzy), a short seller would simply be diminishing their worth to gain at best only a little delay in the increasing march of Bitcoin!  And in fact, as they would be obligated to buy at the later date, they end up increasing the velocity of Bitcoin trading which would further add to Bitcoin's reputation!
During this run up of Bitcoin, I think this would be a bad move.  Gold likely can be manipulated this way as its position is mostly established, with fewer unknowns.

And yet, even at 150 dollars, Bitcoin is only able to denominate transactions that total less than 2 billion dollars. Coupled with the observation that most people are using Bitcoin as a store of value, and Bitcoin isn't anywhere near its "natural" price.
You observe that many early adopters have cashed out.  I am not sure that is true, but if so, then Bitcoin would be gaining broader adoption.  That speaks for Bitcoin's success rather than being a problem.
Really if Bitcoin just managed to capture a bit of the Internet transactions it facilitates well (retail, porn, drugs, secure "off shore" accounts), Bitcoin can hardly help but continue to advance.

I am an engineer, so I am not sure I can answer this question correctly;  only give my opinion.
I think once the "Monetary Pump" is removed or avoided (i.e. people are offered someplace to put their money that cannot be diluted by printing more money) then the central banks will have to tighten up to compete, or they will outright fail.  Many very very very rich will be reduced to just very rich.  Some early Bitcoin adopters are going to become insanely wealthy.  I think more wealthy than we have ever seen before.  But most of that wealth will dissipate quickly.  The newly rich rarely can handle wealth of that kind of magnitude well.
I think once the economies of the world shift some percentage of operations into a global, hard currency, the rest quickly follow.  Where that tipping point might be is hard to say, but I would guess it is as low as a thousandth of the economy at large.
Once converted, excesses made possible by cheap money (paying executives 100's of millions of dollars per year) will go away. Much of the financial games that caused the 2008 crash will cease, because hard money is just harder to push around than the stuff the Fed prints and injects into the economy through the banks.
Over all, Bitcoin can't solve all our problems.  I don't know how government will adjust (but I am sure they will).  The rich will still be the rich, and the corporate powers will still attempt to concentrate wealth.  However without a monetary pump, I think things will begin to equal out more.

How does that compare to the security of making a credit card transaction?
As far as creating secure private keys, that can be a problem.  But it is a solvable problem.  We can move to 1024 bit keys.  We can move to multiple keys.  You can (like with dollars) choose to use a company you trust to manage your private keys.
But the fact remains that you could know every single thing about me, from by SSN to my birth date, where I grew up, went to school, all my relationships. You could have my email accounts, have access to my cell phone, whatever. You could then access any of the money that I have in the traditional world.

Bitcoin has to be valued more, because banks can leverage dollars (the whole fractional reserve thing), but to transfer Bitcoin as Bitcoin, you really have to have Bitcoin.  
Don't know if that means Bitcoin displaces more or less.... Not that that matters all that much either way.  But it does mean that Bitcoins value is forced upwards where the increasing of the money supply with dollars pushes the value of dollars down.

@_date: 2013-12-21 23:54:55


That is true.  But when you borrow from a *bank* to pay for a good or service, you generally move around bank credit.  But if the bank has to cough up actual Bitcoin to pay for a high ticket item, then they actually have to hand over hard cash (bitcoin).  Especially since there is little reason to redeposit said hard cash.
Payment plans for services rendered leave banks out of the process.


But not the interest paid on top of the loan.  And that is my point.  Inflation does not make the earnings go away, even if the value of the loan was diminished by inflation.


The trick here is when the next crash hits, the mortgages that disappear with the defaults will be on the Fed's books, and not on the Banks.  They don't care about money, as you say, because whether they are paid back, or the borrowers default, the money disappears either way.


My position is exactly that.  If you don't understand how a complex system works, you can't make it work better by fudging it.  But you *can make those in control a heck of a lot of money.*  Which is why we continue doing it.


And our meddling is likely to be just as good for the system, i.e. we are destroying the economy as we are the environment.

Talk to the tech industry.  The pressure to lower prices due to higher productivity, lower resource costs, etc.  overwhelms monetary inflation by the banks and the Federal Reserve.
Now everyone would like to lower costs and take all the gains as profit, that is true.  But that is why we have competition in a capitalist economy, so that prices are lowered to compete.
People in an inflationary environment accept lower real wages because of the Money Illusion, the fact that higher numbers "feel" like more money, even when they are not.  Nothing controversial here, this is classic John Maynard Keynes economics here.




How so?  Lower prices and higher valued savings and wages means that there are more resources to draw upon to build a business, and in the market to buy your product.  The rate of economic growth in America dropped after 1971.  There is no evidence that inflation increased economic growth, but quite the opposite.  And for over 50 years now.




Hogwash.  The tech industry, which has always been in "deflation", does not pay people less than other sectors.  Higher productivity means you produce more product for the same labor and resources.  So you can lower prices without lowering wages.
Deflation is only bad when it is due to defaults that force the money supply to shrink.  There is no harm from deflation due to productivity increases.  There is no evidence that productivity increases harm the economy.


You do not know me, you don't know what I have studied, and you are not in a position to make this kind of determination.  What, I have to be ignorant just because I don't agree with you?




Inflation and Deflation in most economic discussions today refers to the nominal prices of goods and services.  Some view the terms as referring to the money supply, particularly the M3 and M4 measures.  I haven't used those definitions in this discussion, but have stuck to what is normal today, i.e. price levels.
And the "price levels" in the tech sector have fallen consistently for 100 years.  And the price levels for medical care and education have grown consistently in the same period.  Independent of government polices.  Incidentally, the same differences in price reductions/growth for technology vs education occur in all countries.  In all political systems.  For all periods where we have records.
Read up on Baumol's Cost Disease.  Different economic sectors do not gain the same cost savings from technology and productivity.  
But in fact, by any classical measure and definition, technology as a sector has been in deflation for 60 years at least.  Unless you want to define deflation as something else than a measure of prices.

Almost all protocols compete with other protocols, and either they dominate and eliminate (like TCP/IP has done to various other network stacks), or they learn to play together.
I do think that multiple digital currencies provides for a more healthy market.  You cannot ignore the fact that Government and Banks are likely to try and take over any currency that sees any significant success.  
The ability of us to quickly and painlessly jump to LTC or some other digital currency is something we need to understand and encourage.  If we don't practice now while the stakes are pretty low, we won't be ready when the stakes get high.

And people would have to be more careful taking out loans.  But since your savings and wages are not being toasted away by inflation, saving for purchases, or borrowing from your family estate (which might actually be worth something) becomes possible!

Bitcoin, unlike dollars in gold, is more useful to transact as bitcoin itself. With dollars or gold or Euros or yen or whatever, the currency itself is hard to transact. So instead you transact using the bank credit via checks,  credit cards, payment processors, money transfer services.
But with bitcoin, you use bitcoin in the transaction. Not a check for bitcoin. Not a credit card enumerated in bitcoin. But actual Bitcoin. Therefore Bitcoin is not is subject to banking excesses as either dollars or gold.

That assumes anyone can "attack" a distributed crypto currency.  Not really likely.  What can be attempted is to take over mining operations.  Litecoin makes that harder for now.
Besides, we have many regular currencies today, mostly designed the same.  Why can't we have several crypto currencies?

Not sure where you think I am trying to weaken controls on the Fed... I am so in favor of full audits of the Federal Reserve, and BTW audits of the gold reserves held by the Fed.
Taking monetary policy out of government and central bank hands is a wonderful idea if they are not in a position to manipulate the replacement system.  Mostly Gold is difficult to manipulate (because the hard stuff either exists or it doesn't) which is why government and banks hate gold.  But gold isn't fungible enough to be used directly, and thus its weakness as a currency. (i.e. there is hardly anyway to give 1/1400 of an ounce of gold to someone to buy a soda). 
Bitcoin is gold, only usable directly.


Buy a coin or two.  What is the harm of $100 or $200 to hold a stake?  That is what I thought when Bitcoin was going for 75 cents.  I really haven't regretted buying in;  if anything, I kinda regret not putting down a few thousand.

I do agree that money has been and is being used to control ... heck, I will say it.  To control the world. 
But don't think that they can "rein in" Bitcoin.  Bitcoin provides frictionless transactions world wide.  Everyone is using the same ruler, the same coin.  This is a nearly perfect monetary system, free from requiring "certificate of ownership" documents that can be forged by banks.  Free from a physical  embodiment that can be stolen.  Free from even a physical location, once this makes it to court. (How can one claim one is "exporting" a currency that only exists on a block chain, which is replicated into every country on the planet?).
IF Bitcoin is compromised, we will all move to Litecoin.  Within days.  If Litecoin is compromised, we will move to Namecoin, or PPCoin, or heck, China coin.  Or "NEW" coin with Zerocoin tech baked right in.
Everyone knows this.  So they will have to leave Bitcoin alone.
Lastly, do not forget China.  China may have no alternative to the dollar to put forward, but if China can make world markets level, then heck that is better than the dollar.  China has deep deep hard money cultural roots, and Bitcoin could find a home there.  If it does, then given the size of China (and other "developing" economies suffering under the dollar), it may not matter what the Federal Reserve does.

Also... Wallet != Bitcoin address
How can you even detect a wallet when it is a collection of a thousand BTC addressees?
And if Bitcoin is illegal, then you have to make all virtual currencies illegal, or people will just switch to Litecoin, out ppcoin, or ripple, or terracoin, or feathercoin, or any of the 60 other coins out there.
Worse, either Bitcoin or a new coin gets zerocoin tech baked right in, and all tracking of transactions is lost.  
Lastly in court the gov would have to prove that Bitcoin is significantly harder to monitor than dollars today. And what percentage of illegal transactions are intercepted today?  Out of U.N estimated 300+ billion dollar illicit economy in the USA alone, the DOJ and all federal enforcement and state enforcement combined intercept about 1.2 billion.   
That's it.  Less than 1 percent of all illegal dollar transactions.  Maybe even less than a half of a percent.  Child pornography, terrorism, extortion, drugs, gambling, stolen goods, prostitution, slavery.... All are thriving today using dollars, Euros, yen, and the other central bank currencies.  Bitcoin actually has advantages for law enforcement over legacy currencies.

What assumptions?




2) It can't consistently grow faster than real growth. It's a definitional thing, not a bitcoin is special thing.
Grow in value I assume.  Because central banks can grow money supplies faster than real growth for extended periods at least, which is where inflation comes from, and we have had every year since the 70's.
3) Do you believe fiat currencies will be replaced with bitcoin?
No.  I think we will go back to commodity backed money, and that backing will likely include Bitcoin.




On my phone so it's hard for me to lookup what I said.  But commodities are any actual thing bought or sold.  Gold silver oil.  Some claim Bitcoin to be a virtual commodity.

I could just claim you are absurd too.   And given that my understanding of "anything [I've] read" might include Tom Sawyer and today's lunch menu, I don't think I'd have a hard time proving the absurdity of what you said. 
But of course, I have no idea what about my "statement" you find absurd.  Let's take some guesses:
* You believe businesses don't have to worry about money transmission laws if they take payment via Mastercard or Visa or Paypal.  Thus it is absurd that I said that doesn't protect you.
* You believe KYC laws do not require a money transmitter to know both parties involved in a transaction that they are facilitating.  Thus it is absurd that I claimed KYC does exactly require identification of both parties in a facilitated transaction.
* You believe FinCEN does not consider exchanges of value (commodities) under their money laundering responsibilities, but only currencies.  Thus it is absurd that I implied that they feel all transfers of value are under their purview.
All those seem pretty firmly in the middle of the law, and exactly the stance that FinCEN has taken with regards to Bitcoin.  What exactly is it that you think is absurd?

50% would as well.  Assume 10 percent of the offshore accounts move to Bitcoin.  10 percent of the Internet transactions, and 10 percent of remittance.  
That's 10 percent of (534 billion + 34 trillion + 10 trillion) = ~4.5 Trillion dollars, i.e. ~212,000 per Bitcoin.
At that value, rising more or less consistently for a few years towards that value, you have to assume this is a snapshot of the value and it would continue to rise.

You work, you are paid, you save, you buy stuff.  If you need a loan, you take out a loan.  But if your money doesn't depreciate in value, all goods and services become more affordable over time with productivity and technology gains.  You can pay interest on loans if you need to.


Bitcoin isn't a debt based currency.  You do not have to pay interest on every Bitcoin in existence as you do with  dollars, or more accurately, "Federal Reserve Notes".   Savings hold value over time, meaning the money supply inflates by growing the value of wages and savings.  The need for loans are diminished.
This is bad for banks. But not really any one else.
@_date: 2013-10-22 04:10:33

First off, "most people" haven't a clue about Bitcoin today.  So "most people" are not really in play yet.
Besides, once an idea is proven, it will find an implementation that works.  Just like when Geni, AOL, and Compuserve's email went away, it was replaced by SMTP.  And most email clients replaced by Web clients.
In fact, with technology, if it is *significantly superior* to the existing solutions, then adoption follows.  We have no examples of technologies that are 1) provably faster and cheaper, yet 2) utterly failed without some implementation taking the technology forward.
Consider passingbitcoin.com.  You can't do that with dollars and credit cards.

So let's say someone has 100 BTC in the bank.  That is like 12,500 dollars today.  But the value of BTC rises, so now they have 1,250,000 dollars.
Yeah, I can see why they would hate that.  Makes them feel terrible.... NOT.
The money illusion is created by equating price inflation to monetary inflation, as if monetary inflation is the only factor contributing to setting prices.  But in fact you have productivity and technology improvements that lower prices (that's why computers are getting cheaper!).  
The dirty secret is that productivity improvements are lowering the prices of all goods, not just computer stuff.  So monetary inflation is not only bringing prices up, it is also offsetting the natural fall of prices brought on by higher productivity and technology.
So you get a 5 percent raise and you are told that is 2 percent over inflation.  But it isn't.  It is 2 percent over **price inflation**.   If your industry achieved a 3 percent increase in productivity, then price inflation of 3 percent is really monetary inflation of 5 percent.  
A 5 percent raise is really breaking even, from the value of the money you are being paid.  Everyone that got less?  Well the extra money went to management and investors.  Wage earners lost ground.
People will be happy if they maintain their salary, and prices go down.  They will be able to purchase more goods.  At some point they might be asked to take a slight cut in pay.  That is really tough to do, so real wages will rise.
Now when prices are low, people spend more.  That is why we have sales.  That's why sales work.
Sticker shock from rising prices, particularly when wages are not rising as fast, forces people to spend less, and avoid purchases.  And even avoid debt.
We are seeing this now.  In the economy.
I don't think you have really thought through the nature of money.

Bitpay.  Takes volatility out of the equation.  Cheaper than credit cards.  $30 a month, all the transactions you want converted to the currency you want regardless of Bitcoin's value.

The constitution kinda matters when the people you step on have money (1.4 billion dollars at least in the market), and they are willing to take you to court.

Building the Hash power to take over the Bitcoin network would be... a challenge.  And doing so would put the US in a great place with an new currency.

Beanie Babies and tulips are worthless as a world wide medium of exchange, and the tulip story, though widely repeated, isn't even confirmed as something that really happened.


It isn't a given that the dollar is here to stay.  In fact, the dollar we have today is radically different than the dollar prior to 1971 (with breaking the last tie to Gold) and that dollar is radically different than the dollar prior to 1933, as gold ownership was banned in that year.  And that dollar was radically different than the bank notes issued prior to 1914 and the institution of the Federal Reserve.
Changes in currency go all the way back through our history.  There is no reason to believe that we will not make radical changes in the future.
The name "Dollar" will persist in some form.  It just isn't likely to be the same thing.


Depends on how you define "worthless".  The Dollar has lost nearly all its buying power already.  How much does it have to lose to be declared worthless?  
Bitcoin provides key advantages over Central Bank managed dollars.  In particular, the ability to construct automatic and irreversible and immediate payments internationally is going to be a tough thing to walk away from once businesses start taking advantage of them.  The next few years are critical for Bitcoin, but I don't see Bitcoin going away.  And the odds are Bitcoin will either be worth 0$ or worth something north of 100K per.  And that within 3 to 5 years.

But having a a third party is still nice, but with Bitcoin who that third party is becomes more flexible too.  Afterall, you *expect the actual address used* to change as you go along.  You get tied into a bank because accounts are more static.

Fractional reserve banking isn't going to be successful where people withdraw the reserves out on a regular basis.  And interest is a red herring, as Banks don't pay interest today (not such that it offsets significantly the damage to your money caused by central banks).

The class of Crypto Currencies has an advantage over Government/Banking/Corporate backed currencies.  And it is quite possible and even maybe unavoidable that additional crypto currencies will provide some path to inflate money supplies along side Bitcoin.
I don't think any of this takes away from the value of these new currencies.  No more than the existence of the Yen or the Euro calls the value of the Dollar into question.

Point? Note in your graph the hash power is staying above the difficulty.  And the average confirmation time (time between blocks) has been less than 10 minutes mostly for some months.
Taking into account not just the current hash power but the rate at which hash power is changing is required to maintain 10 m minutes between blocks.

I think your argument amounts to saying that Microwaves are not as useful as an oven or a stove.
Just because something has a niche purpose when compared to something else in its space doesn't mean you don't have strong driving factors towards adoption.


And that is true for many situations.  Paying taxes, maybe buying from vending machines, perhaps many face to face transactions.  However it is going to far to assert that because dollars are known and used that there is a binary relationship between using Bitcoin and using Dollars where a user has to pick one or the other.  For many situations, Bitcoin is just flat better.  And in quite a few, the dollar has significant advantages.
Bitcoin has these advantages:
* Cannot be counterfeited
* Fast, inexpensive transactions
* Secure transactions (engaging in a transaction doesn't expose your account to risk)
* Allows for real time auditing where useful 
* Privacy through obscurity where useful
* Is not subject to massive inflation
* Is not subject to transaction restrictions, capital controls
* Is not subject to charge backs (both an advantage and disadvantage, admittedly)
The Dollar has these advantages:
* Financial institutions will be slow to support Bitcoin, and they just do not do so today.
* Taxes are going to be paid in dollars for a long time.
* Loans are depreciated by inflation, reducing debt load 
* The dollar is still the reserve currency of the world
* inertia
Where holding your money in dollars subjects you to at least the 2 to 3 percent inflation maintained over the last 40 years, Bitcoin will not suffer the same loss of value.  At the very least, Bitcoin provides a more secure store of value than investment instruments denominated in dollars.  And Bitcoin provides secure transactions with parties that you may not trust so much.  I have had to have my American Express card reissued 3 times in as many years because somewhere along the way I use the card with a party that leaked my information.  Who?  How could I even know?  Every  company I transact with the card gets everything they need to know to charge as they will against my card!

If PayPal supported exchanges, BTC-&gt;USD and USD-&gt;BTC between parties, in addition to adding consumer protection to pure BTC transactions by acting as an escrow service of some delay before actual payment to the merchant, then their very participation would likely explode the value of BTC.  
And the wealth of BTC they could collect through BTC-&gt;USD conversions might actually make them staggering profits.

No, not really.  The supply of Bitcoins is offset by the growing number of Bitcoin users.
1000 Merchants last year serviced by Bitpay.
10,000 Merchants currently serviced by Bitpay.  And that ignores Coinbase and other competitors.
The inflation of the raw number of Bitcoins when compared to the inflation of the user base gives you a deflating currency in terms of Bitcoins per user.
On the other hand, Dollars are in inflation any way you wish to look at them.
@_date: 2013-04-09 13:54:31
1) Bitcoin is technically in deflation when it the growth of the currency does not meet the demand curve.  Focusing on the technical number of Bitcoins doesn't make Bitcoin inflationary when the number of users and uses of Bitcoin coming online far and away exceed the slight inflation rate of Bitcoin.  It is the ratio of the Number of coins in existence to the Number needed as a monetary system that matters, and that ratio has been and will remain deflationary on average forever, unless we hit a real drop in productivity (at which point Bitcoin will naturally inflate again, as the ratio of Bitcoin to Use will actually rise).
2)  Meh!  Who you trust and why you trust is a game of the minds of people.  Most people trust dollars because that is all they have ever known. They don't trust Bitcoin because it is new and untested (in their experience). Which is just a really short version of what you wrote.

It is actually very interesting to play with the numbers.  If you deposit 100 dollars and the bank loans out 80, then entity taking the loan deposits that 80 and the bank loans out 70, and so forth... 
The bank can effectively earn 20 percent interest off of 100 real dollars, even if the interest rate is pretty low (5 or 6 percent).  Now on the books they have like 400 dollars deposited, but that is mostly a fiction. Because the Money merry go round isn't real.  When (not if) something goes wrong, suddenly all those loans go away and the money disappears... Then the Federal Reserve prints money and pumps it all back up.
It is that last step that is missing for Bitcoin, and it is the complaint Banks have always had with Gold backed money.  You can't do it there either.
Bitcoin stands to shrink banking enormously.  Because you don't need the intermediate layers to transact.  And as the value of Bitcoin rises, you can use smaller amounts without risk of counterfeiting or other such problems.  You can't pay for a coke effectively with 1/1300 of an ounce of Gold, but you can easily pay 1/1300 of a Bitcoin.

Oh we agree that futures trading would continue.  However. Bitcoin is very difficult to leverage (you can't depend on inflation to bail you out, lack of a lender of last resort), so you would see a reduction in the speculation in futures.  And you will see a downsizing of banking services...

I suspect that 54.3 uBTC came from looking at the market price, and kinda sort of cutting out "sub penny" transactions.  From the discussion on the topic, 54.3 uBTC was estimated as being ~ .007 USD.
Of course today we are trading at 120.00 USD, so 54.3 uBTC = ~.0065 USD.  At the BTC high ($266), 54.3 uBTC = ~ 0.014 USD.  Which illustrates my point.  The ".3" digit isn't doing anything.

I have seen this argument before, and it seems to  me to be an attempt to argue definitions rather than addressing the real issues head on.  In particular FinCEN claims it is fine for users to buy, spend, and (presumably though less clear) sell Bitcoin.  And a miner can buy stuff with mined Bitcoin.  But he can't sell his Bitcoin.  
Why? Because the miner is"transmitting" money from one location to another.  Really?  What pray tell are these locations? There are half as many when compared to a user (he has to first obtain Bitcoin before he can sell, the miner only sells).

But they don't loan out dollars.  They loan out bank credit, because whatever they loan (on average) comes back to them.  So 100 dollars could go like this:
- A deposits 100 dollars, they loan 90 to B
- B deposits 90 dollars, they loan 80 to C
- C deposits 80 dollars, they loan 70 to D
- D deposits 70 dollars, they load 60 to E
- E deposits 60 dollars, they loan 50 to F
- F deposits 50 dollars, they loan 40 to G
- G deposits 40 dollars, they loan 30 to H
- E deposits 30 dollars, they loan 20 to I
- F deposits 20 dollars, they loan 10 to  J
- J deposits 10 dollars.
So on 100 real dollars, they are collecting interest on 450 dollars.  (They actually use percentages, not a constant 10 dollars off the top, so the real amount they earn interest on is far higher than just a 4.5x expansion of the real deposit).  That's how you get a M3 money supply.
They don't care about small amounts of inflation.  As long as they can fractionally loan out funds they pay nothing to hold, they need not every resolve anything to actual dollars unless there is a run on the bank.  And we don't have runs on banks anymore, because the fed will just print the needed paper anyway.
3 percent on 450 dollars in loans starting with 100 dollars means they are getting 4.5x the returns over the interest you are paying.  If everyone is paying 2 percent, they are making 9 percent.  They can handle 2 percent inflation.
Meanwhile, wages are going down in real cost for most of corporate america.  Inflation lowers wages.  So you want inflation if wages are too high.  If they are too low (and really, given normal people increasingly cannot afford healthcare and education, so they likely are) then inflation is really bad.  Well for most people.  Still good for corporate profits.

The complexity of the unknown as compared to the complexity we know.
Seriously, with Bitcoin I can create a wallet in seconds, and provide that address to someone in seconds, who can pay me in seconds (even if I need to wait a bit longer for transactions to confirm).
With the current financial system, I have to open a bank account.  Then I need to sign up for Merchant support through some payment processor.  For someone to pay me, they have to sign up for one of the credit cards my payment processor will accept.    Then there is this whole card swipe, sometimes sign, sometimes give your zipcode, provide a verification code thing....  As one receiving the payment, I have to be concerned about fraud, because if someone uses a stolen card to buy stuff, I stand a risk of the real owner noticing and initiating a dispute, which will result in a charge back where that money I thought I received as payment just goes away.
Anyone that believes today's systems are more simple than using Bitcoin is just being blinded by the fact that we are already immersed in the complexity of the current system.  It isn't simple, and it isn't simpler than using Bitcoin.
And current financial transaction processes are not anywhere near as secure as Bitcoin.

Again, not from a merchant.
Do you want to talk about all the dollar thefts?  How about 3 billion missing in dollars shipped by the government to Iraq?  Of course that has nothing to do with transaction fraud, stealing information from merchants.
Bitcoin can be secured.  But if you can transact with them, then they can also be lost.
Credit cards cannot.  Every time you give your credit card for a payment, you are at risk.  Every.  Single. Time.   And to counter that leaky ship, the credit card companies refund you for fraudulent charges by picking the pockets of the merchants that had no way of knowing the charge was fraudulent, for the most part.
We all pay for that.  With every single thing we buy, because it is the cost of doing business, and it is passed on to all of us.

It should be pointed out as well that the money supply is far far larger all around. This is because the direct use of these legacy currencies is difficult and insecure.  So instead of paying say 4.5 literal billion dollars for a company (like Apple and Microsoft did when they bought Motorola) they instead transfer money through the banking system.
... only very little of the monetary base is involved here.  Instead this is a transfer of bank credit from some set of banks to other sets of banks.
Same when you buy a car or a house.  Nobody much at all will actually withdraw hard cash for large purchases, and doing so is subject to government suspicion of money laundering and drug crime.
In a Bitcoin world, Bitcoin is *More secure* than credit cards, checks, wire transfers, or money orders.  So transactions actually use Bitcoin directly more often (nearly always) rather than bank credit as compared to when using the legacy currencies.
So to compare Bitcoin to just the momentary base is to understate magnitude of legacy currencies in circulation, and understate the value of Bitcoin required to displace the legacy currencies.

Dollars are easier for money laundering.  The 300 billion dollar illicit economy (in the USA alone) only suffers about 1.2 billion in seizures a year by the DOJ.  That's less than 0.5 percent.
Credit cards "seize" a greater percentage of legit transactions.  Crime pays way way less.  Today. Using dollars.  Dollars are crime's best financial tool.
On the other hand, the capture of silk road represents far more success in the Bitcoin ecosystem than any one can claim for dollars.

The Bible is anarchist.  Agriculture was the business of civilization,   while shepherding was the business of nomads and self rule.
Able (shepherd) was killed by Cain (farmer) because God accepted Able's sacrifice (a lamb) and rejected Cain's (fruit of the soil).  The tower of Babble was destroyed because it organized people too much.  Sodom and Gomorrah were evil and destroyed, not Abraham the righteous shepherd.  David was a shepherd, but was corrupted as a King.  Read Samuel's rant against Kings in 1 Samuel 8:








What set Israel apart from other nations is the lack of a King and the lack of a government, but that everyone came together as needs arose and disbanded afterwards.
Then you go through all the Kings and their stories.  The kings lead the Northern Kingdom astray, and they are destroyed, and the Southern Kingdom was the same, taken captive, then eventually scattered.
Psalms 23:  The Lord is my *Shepherd*...
Even the scripture "Render unto Caesar that which is Caesar's, and to God that which is God's" is misunderstood today.  Because we live in a Western Culture, not a Jewish one:












Here is what we don't see.  As Jews, they could not carry and use objects with *a graven image* of something or someone that claimed *to be a god*.  That is why a coin had to be brought to Jesus. As a good Jew, he wouldn't have been carrying around the graven image of a "god". And why the Pharisees had to send for one, so it could be "brought it to Jesus."  They wouldn't have been carrying around such a thing with them.  If they had, they would have just given him a coin!  Instead it was "brought to him".  There is some chance that they wouldn't even touch it!
The message here is that you give to government what is their's, but in as much as you can opt out of their business, you do so.  
I could go on.  But if you go through scripture, you will find that Civilization is repeatedly evil, and only repents temporarily if at all.  Shepherds and nomads are mostly on the better side.  In any contest (David [shepherd] and Goliath [Philistine champion]) between the two, civilization either loses, or is clearly the evil one. 
Bitcoin is the currency of everyone and nobody.  I would say it is the currency of the nomad over civilization.  
And Revelation is a book that addresses issues in Rome;  and if not you are unlikely to understand what they mean anyway.  Prophesy, even in the Bible, is more like economics than science.  You use it to explain events *after they happen*.  They do not *predict events*.  Science makes predictions.  Economics and Prophesy make explanations. 
Jesus didn't tell the Rich young ruler that he needed to believe a particular theology or prophesy to be righteous.  He said sell all you have and give it to the poor and follow me.  
**tl;dr:** If you are worried about the Christian side of Bitcoin, give to Bitcoin charities like  to feed the homeless.  Do not look to prophesies, because you will just get them wrong anyway.

I am working with the APIs of the Bitcoin network.  I don't see how they can be hijacked without everyone just moving to a platform that isn't.  And that is assuming the *Open Source* community is even willing to be hijacked (I don't see that).
Centralized, non-transparent systems do force us into them today.  You can do so, or as you say, go live in a tree.  That isn't much of a choice, so we are sucked in.  Bitcoin provides an alternative.

(Miners have to pay transaction fees to send Bitcoin, just like everyone else.  But let me be clear on my rant:)
But if you go read the [FinCEN guidelines]( they say:


So a user "who obtains" ... How is the fact that a user can buy Virtual Currency and not be a Money Transmitter, but a user that mines Virtual Currency (just another way to obtain it) is?  Here is the actual language:


Okay, makes sense, but then they say:


Why?  I create Bitcoin and sell it for dollars.  Where did I take money and transmit it from one location to another? Let's walk through what FinCEN seems to be saying: 
* If use dollars to buy Bitcoin from MtGox and withdraw it to my wallet in my bedroom, then sort of the Bitcoin exists in my bed room.  Then I send it to MtGox and buy dollars from MtGox.  All legal.  MtGox is a Money Service Business, and I am just a user.  All fine. 
* Now I am a miner.  I mine some Bitcoin in my bedroom. I send it to MtGox and buy dollars from MtGox.  Suddenly I am a money Transmitter? 
Why?  Where is the transmission in the second case that wasn't present in the first case?  In fact, in the first case I actually move the Bitcoin around more than in the second case!!!  And in the Second case I already used a Money Service Business that (one might assume) is already reporting the transaction!!!


Doesn't this this make all miners exchangers?  After all, THEY are the ones putting the transactions into the blockchain, and doing the actual transmission of ownership of Bitcoin.  They get the transaction fees.  And the block reward!  But not according to how FinCEN seems to describe mining....

Limiting the term "intrinsic" so harshly renders the word useless.  You are correct on some level of course, because we as people are the ones ascribing what has "value" and what doesn't.  
At the end of the day, the motivation to claim "intrinsic value" for a thing is based on the thing having some set of unique properties.  Those motivations exist for Bitcoin, that is all I am saying.
And oh by the way, when I first read some of the claims of intrinsic value for Bitcoin, I absolutely rejected them.  But it got me to thinking about what attribute could be validated, tested, and confirmed that Bitcoin had that would in fact make it unique.  And thus my little rant.

A Bitcoin address serves the role of a public key;  its implementation isn't all that important, and programs don't have to be able to convert a Bitcoin address to a literal public key for it to act as a public key.  Though as you point out, in most useful cases, we do get a conversion of a Bitcoin address to a public key...
The argument isn't unlike claiming that programs no longer use addresses on modern micro processors, as all addresses are really indirect addresses and do not map directly to the addresses in physical memory, but are rather mapped to physical memory through a Memory Management Unit (MMU) and several layers of cache... Heck, physical memory doesn't even get all the updates from a program as it is running!  
But if it walks like a duck, and quacks like a duck.... 
It is reasonable to talk about addresses within memory when you are programming, and public keys in encryption systems when you are describing how they work....  unless you are doing the kind of work where manipulating the MMU, caches, or the actual encryption keys really matters.

Off topic, but interesting.  
Still Currencies are not so strictly defined as being issued and assigned value by central governments/banks.  That has only been true for the last 100 years, and currencies go back thousands of years before that.  If anything, the feeling was that in the modern world, a currency would have to have such backing.  Nobody could think of a away a currency could arise without a government or central bank making it money.
Then we had Bitcoin.
Bitcoin isn't so much breaking the definition of currencies, but the theories about what is required to make something a currency.
The point of my statement prior to your reply was that currently fraud in manipulating a fantasy currency is a fantasy crime.  You have to make Bitcoin a recognized currency before manipulating its market would be a crime.  Otherwise it is like killing someone in a game.  Killing is a crime, but fantasy killing (or even hiring someone to kill someone else in a fantasy game) just isn't a real crime.

Fraudulent charges against your Bitcoin address are not possible if you secure your private keys.  Nobody you transact with can make a fraudulent charge just because you buy something from them.
Everyone you send a check to, or pay with a credit card is given all they need to make a fraudulent charge against your account.  Credit cards and banks *have to refund* such fraud, or nobody would use their services.  They sometimes cover the fraud, and sometimes they simply take the money back from the merchant.  And they are only required to address fraud you report... Fraud you fail to report, you pay for.

PayPal faces the prisoner's dilemma.  That is where some number of prisoners are taken.  If they hold to their story, then nobody can be charged.  However, that requires that none of them breaks rank.  Prisoners are offerred freedom for breaking rank.  The dilemma is that if you are not the first to break rank, you go to jail. So holding to the story requires faith that everyone else holds as well.
What is the "prisoner's dilemma here?
* The best case for PayPal and many other organizations is Bitcoin fails, and nothing changes.
* If anyone else jumps in to support Bitcoin, then it succeeds, and that company reaps the benefit.
Who are your prisoners?
* PayPal of course
* Huge Banks (BoA, Wells Fargo, CitiBank, HSBC, Bank of London, etc.)
* Credit Card companies (Amex, Mastercard, VISA, Discover, etc.)
* Trading companies 
* Off shore banking (holding 30T in assets today for the rich and corporations)
All of these actors are biding their time.  They *are* watching.  What is going to force a move?
* Dozens if not hundreds of "Bitcoin Startups"
* Bitcoin value over 10 billion (1 BTC trading over ~$900)
What are they likely waiting for, maybe hoping for?
* Some decisive government action against Bitcoin
Who has nearly nothing to gain from Bitcoin?
* Central Banks, as far as I can tell.  They might be able to use Bitcoin like gold to back their currencies though...
* Big Central Governments.  They depend on easy money.  On the other hand, debt denominated in dollars may evaporate if Bitcoin succeeds, and International Trade might benefit from easy transactions.
Right now Bitcoin remains trivial.  Headed towards $200 now (maybe by the end of April), But really on track to make $900 this year.
Something is going to give soon.

What are you measuring?
Most economists equate rising prices to inflation.  So is the tech industry in deflation?  Education in explosive inflation?  
Really?  In all countries?  For all time periods for which we have data?  Is there something going on that we are not measuring?
FACT: There are more forces at work in setting prices than simply monetary inflation (i.e. the changes in prices due to an increasing money supply).  For example, you have productivity increases that are putting downward pressure on prices (that is what you see overwhelm monetary inflation in tech).  You have seasonal variation.  You have cultural changes, fads.  You have subsidies, regulations, tariffs.  Educational campaigns.
But if a measure, a variable, that we call "inflation", has a value that is the sum of many (sometimes hard to impossible to measure) forces, what exact good is it?  Particularly, what good is it for adjusting wages and comparing values over time?
After all, there are at least 20 different measures for "inflation" tracked by the Federal Reserve in St. Louis.  Which one is the right number?

Just not true.  They got in trouble for making a series of big **cash deposits** that individually were under 10,000, but collectively added up over that amount.
With BTC, they would not have been making any deposits.  They would not have broken that law.  They might have made big sells of Bitcoin, but then the exchange would have been responsible for reporting those sells, not them.   They would have been responsible for reporting income, but that is another issue entirely.
I should note that had they just stuffed the cash in a mattress, they also would have avoided breaking the law.  They were not responsible for reporting the sale of every tomato, onion, painting, chicken sculpture, or whatever the heck they were selling.  They were responsible for doing paperwork on large deposits of cash into a bank.

M1 and M2 are hard numbers.  At least they are defined and measurable.
Most measures of purchasing power make adjustments for seasonal and productivity effects. Again, imperfectly and I'm skeptical of their political biases.
How does the CPI adjust for productivity effects?  It seeks to level prices of a basket of goods even though this by definition ignores productivity increases.
It's good for thinking you have an understanding of what's happening to purchasing power. Mostly an illusory understanding.
As an engineer, I cannot parse the phrase "illusionary understanding".  Any measure that misleads research is a stupid measure...




Yet we can measure money supply, and we can stack various approaches to measure money supplies.  Purchasing power should not be equated to price inflation because this neglects too many forces acting on prices.

Lastly you neglect that even very small amounts can be bought, and you get the same rate of return.  Not many investments scale down that way.

Actually, for small purchases, the submission of the transaction is plenty.  Anything in a store or grocery.  
Credit card transactions *are not as fast as they appear*, and the risk of the transaction *falls to the merchant, not VISA or Mastercard*.  
So accepting the transaction when it appears on a node the store trusts (should be a few nodes scattered over the planet), then the risk is acceptable for normal purchases. Double spends will take some nodes and not others.  Query a few, and if they all agree, then there isn't a double spend in progress.  If there is, have they purchaser arrested and charged with attempted theft. 
Fact:  We don't have many if any examples of successful double spends in the wild, but credit card fraud is vast and huge.

The use of payment processor in a transaction does not "fix" things for amazon, eBay, etc. These merchants all allow you to specify a destination address with out validating anything about the identity of the individual at that address.

The complaint that you can't easily spend bitcoins isn't the argument you made:


BitPay is a payment processor to allow merchants to accept Bitcoin.  Maybe you didn't mean to exclude the thousands of merchants signing up with BitPay.  BitPay provides applications to present a customer with a QR code and signals the clerk when a transaction of the proper amount has been made. This is a critical and necessary function (regardless of whether the merchant keeps the Bitcoin as Bitcoin or has BitPay convert some or all of it to dollars). 
But it seemed to me that you would not count a Merchant using BitPay to accept Bitcoin as a valid use of Bitcoin as a currency.  Yet even if merchants move to holding Bitcoin, they will still need the services provided by BitPay.
Any of those merchants allow you to go into their store and buy goods with Bitcoin.  I think that is good enough.

Oh I have made face to face purchases and they were really easy.  As easy as cash or a credit card.

You can see one of those transactions here:  
And while we didn't wait for any confirmations, that is likely fine for small purchases (less than 1000 dollars).  It is certainly less risk to a merchant's bottom line than risking charge backs today.

The paragraph you refer to is this one:


The writer has no clue, because people don't really think about what gives money its value.  I doubt 1 in 20 on the street can accurately identify the Federal Reserve, a banking institution, as the organization that issues money.  I doubt if even half of the wrong answers can at least identify the US Treasury as being involved in money.
And even the Author doesn't seem to realize that our monetary policy is *not answerable to its citizens*.  Not in the US, not in Europe.  Central banks answer to banks, and maybe a bit to their governments.  The Citizens are not in the equation.
So really, this objection provided by the authors isn't the barrier to Bitcoin.  But who really cares?  I think the article did a fair and even handed job of describing the tech.  And I think now, nearly 2 years later, they might not end on that note.

Having a marvelously fungible currency means the money supply can expand as needed when the market needs it, simply by increasing the value of the unit of account.  And everyone can always just pay a little less for goods and services.
Then instead of pouring money into the economy on the top by giving money to banks to loan at interest, the money supply expands by increasing the value of wages and savings across the economy.  
If you believe in trickle down, then you believe money needs to be given to the richest most powerful segment of the economy to the benefit of us all.
If you reject trickle down economics, then you should expect it to be better to increase wages and savings.
So a fixed currency just works better.  For everyone but the financial sector.

The exchange rate is different from the attributes of a Bitcoin.  What I am trying to say is that the attribute of Bitcoin to be passed across the Internet without a centralized 3rd party has value, just like the conductivity of Gold gives that metal value.

Not really.  It lost 10 percent.  You are going to get profit taking here and there.  The interest in selling has bleed off, and you are developing walls underneath the current price levels on MtGox and Bitstamp (even if BTC-e is more interested in selling than the rest), and MtGox and the rest are all within single digit percentage differences, with some exchanges higher than MtGox.
I personally believe Bitcoin will sit here in the 130's for MtGox, the 120's for everyone else, then start to rise again next week.
Or I could be wrong. ;)

*  Bitcoin expands as needed by increasing in value.
*  No currency in the history of mankind has failed because it is worth too much (i.e. too many people wanted to own it).
* Borrowing is inefficient relative to saving.  Saving pays the consumer until they can purchase.  Borrowing costs the consumer sometimes many times the purchase.  And involves bankers, payments, time, risk.  Which drives more borrowing until (predictably) many default on their loans.
* Inflation isn't healthy.  Note the 40 years of growth in the income gap under the Federal Reserve's constant inflation policy.  Maybe inflation didn't cause the income gap.  But it sure as heck didn't cure the income gap.  And the income gap is our biggest risk faced by the economy, IMHO.
* Everyone spends money.  Deflation is the adjustment of prices to find the point where people wish to spend.  It is ridiculous to believe that at some point nobody will spend because everything in the market is just too cheap to buy.
* Early adopters/investors of all successful technologies (the metal plow, printing press, compass, ship building, steam engines, computers, cell phones, mp3 players, and now Bitcoin) always get rich.    It isn't a ponzi scheme.  Rewards to early investors/adopters is just what drives technology adoption. 
* More resources (energy, materials, people) are spent maintaining current currencies than Bitcoin.  VISA alone has a higher electric bill than what it would require to run Bitcoin for the world.  Bitcoin eliminates counterfeiting.  Requires no credit card companies.  Provides free banking accounts to anyone in the world.  Makes international transfers of money nearly instant.  Heck, just eliminating all the mainframes behind banks would save more power than Bitcoin ever will use.
Will Bitcoin implode?  Well, maybe.  I mean, once the whole silly Internet fad fades away, like [Paul Krugman predicted.](

Yeah, that is the conclusion of the blog entry I posted.
The financial sector will not be able to effectively move against Bitcon if their major players are vested in Bitcoin.  The mistake is to think that the financial sector is run by people that care about the whole sector;  they only care about themselves.
It is the fatal flaw of Keynesianism and the fatal flaw of communism.  These systems only work if the people at the wheel are truly selfless and truly make the best decisions for everyone.  They just don't.
So in this case, Bitcoin is truly subversive.  It is too good an opportunity for the truly wealthy for them to effectively oppose it, past a certain point.  I do think they could act now, but the majority of the financial sector doesn't have bitcoin on the radar.  Once they do (because say Bitcoin denominates a trillion dollars of wealth), well, it will be too late.  Too many rich people will defend it.

@_date: 2013-05-22 00:16:01






True.  The point is that you can price goods with a deflationary currency.  And you can do so forever.  It only requires that you have a truly fungible currency, that can be so subdivided.  Unlike Gold, Bitcoin does this.  I think it is contingent upon the argument against Bitcoin to prove this isn't enough.




As the currency grows in acceptance it will grow in value.  And it will remain fungible, and moving into Bitcoin will provide a positive feedback loop that will act in its favor relative to other currencies.  And as long as merchants move quickly out of Bitcoin (using services like BitPay) yet still lowering fees, acceptance will continue to advance.  
Bitcoin meets a need.  Even if it is volatile. 




From an economic point of view, you have to ask if the cost of borrowing from a bank is the most efficient way run an economy.  Building up savings and the value of wages so that individuals can purchase products directly would be more efficient.  Today we inflate the money supply by adding burdens on individuals through debt.  But increasing the value of their wages and savings would inflate the money supply by distributing buying power through the population.  Yes the rich would gain most of the advantage.  But not all the advantage as is done today. 


Banks don't even come close to offsetting inflation.  And savings and checking are not the primary source of money for banks. Hording == savings == hording.  I could call loaning money usury, which it is, but why the useless negativity?


At some prices are always low enough to inspire spending.  And besides, look at the Trillions of dollars corporations and banks are setting to the side right now.  At least 30 trillion in off shore accounts.  Isn't that hoarding?  Isn't that bad for the economy?  Why doesn't inflation do something about that?






Yeah, but if Bitcoin was adopted globally at any significant level, it would not be fluctuating by 10 percent per day.  And BTW, the dollar fluctuates hugely relative to gold.  That isn't a problem because people are doing business in dollars.


And it doesn't help to flood money into banks once everyone is maxed out.  But in fact wages have never consistently risen in a  period of persistent and consistent inflation.  Compare the average inflation rate prior to 1971 to after 1971.  Inflation has been more consistent.  And on average twice as high.  The Income gap was falling prior to 1971 and it has been rising ever since.


Yep.  Borrow in inflationary currency, and save in deflationary.  The basis of Thier's law.








I have seen some numbers, but I don't like them.  But just considering the number of employees and security measures required to manage unencrypted ledgers of accounts, I'd guess just the gas burned driving to work and back would exceed the cost of a full Bitcoin network.  Not to mention the elimination of Identity theft. (Even if replaced by theft of private keys... harder to do, and perhaps easier to catch... You can watch those accounts for where they are spending...)

To Bitcoin? It is impossible to force Bitcoin into such a system.  Can such a monstrosity be built on top of Bitcoin? Certainly.  But once a person has access to the Bitcoin network, they are home free to avoid anything built on Bitcoin.

You post anything on any legitimate issue and discuss that issue with a fair amount of logic and reason, and this community will discuss it.  They might also try and downplay such concern, but they are going to be interested in talking about it.

I am no huge fan of Microsoft, but I did live through the start of the whole home computer thing (heck, I started out on punch cards!). The fact is that MSDOS and the like did something other approaches did not.  And Bitcoin does something Banks and Credit cards do not do.  
Bitcoin provides a way to exchange tokens that cannot be double spent, cannot be counterfeited, and is totally secure when one transacts with them.  Bitcoin enables security approaches not possible with cash, credit cards, wire transfers, money orders, and the like.  It is the fact that Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies provide enormous advantages for financial transactions that is going to drive their adoption.
And the adoption of Bitcoin may be driven to some extent by "greed".  But it is also going to level out the wealth and power in the world too.  That will not be a bad thing.

It is bad for the financial sector, because today you MUST use them to buy stocks, securities, commodities, (or instruments based on these things) just to maintain the value of your savings.  You can't put your money "in a mattress" or a safe without accepting the erosion of the value over time.  (For example, money saved in [1980 is only worth 35 percent]( of its initial value today)
People cannot freely buy stocks and bonds outside of the financial institutions.  You can buy property and some assets, but largely due to the erosion of savings, this is done through financial institutions by borrowing money rather than saving.


I don't think that is what you meant.  I think you mean that hoarding reduces money available for industry to grow, given your position in this discussion.  And I would argue that your statement is correct to begin with.  By decimating savings, there is less money for industry to grow, necessitating debt as a solution.  But it is a solution to a created problem, not a unavoidable dynamic of economics.  Because if people *had significant savings and wealth* then there would be money to invest (and purchase) in the hands of the people.
@_date: 2013-08-15 15:29:41
Okay.  Do that.  We are in a TOTAL system of inflexible money.
What then is your deflation rate?  It certainly isn't 10 percent unless productivity and production is rising by 10 percent.   If you are going to claim that productivity and production are going to fall, then in an inflexible money system, you get inflation.
That is a simple model without lots of variables.  Not the straw man presented.
In a world where you have 2 to 3 percent deflation per year (because productivity is rising at 2 to 3 percent per year) you do not get deflationary spirals unless you are using debt based money.  Bitcoin isn't debt based.  You cannot create it out of thin air, loan it out, then destroy it when it comes back (like the Fed does with dollars).  Bitcoin acts like a *predictable* gold standard.  With Gold, you never know when someone is going to find a new mine (like the mine found recently in China).  You never know when someone will invent a new process for Gold extraction. Then there is random future crap like asteroid mining and nuclear gold production from other metals...  
And to top it off, you don't really know how much is really being held by people, banks, and governments for sure.
With Bitcoin, all those variables are knowns.  You don't know how many Bitcoins are lost to addresses with destroyed or unknown private keys.  But you know how many there are, how many are being added, and how many are changing hands within the Bitcoin network.

Each payment from each individual would go directly into their account (Bitcoin Wallet).  Later if they chose to convert to USD, they would (one would assume) use some company like their Bank, or Coinbase, or Bitpay.  That transaction (say over 10,000) would be reported by the payment processor.  As a client, they wouldn't have been responsible.
With BTC, they would have never been in a position to make a series of deposits that looked like money laundering.  So they would have never broken the law.

All true, but realistically, Bitcoin's adoption level to day is very, very, very slight.  Maybe .01 percent of the possible users in the world have and use Bitcoin.  Maybe .001 percent of the businesses that could take Bitcoin take it as payment now.  Certainly I am making up those percentages, but I don't think I am far off.  
Yet the Bitcoin network now has over many times the computing power of the top 500 super computers (8X in May, and I saw somewhere something about 200X now, but can't find the reference).
China is exploding with support (relatively speaking) for Bitcoin in some of their biggest companies (which means government support). They are valuing Bitcoin as of this writing at 1854.04 CNY, or $304 dollars a coin.
That kind of interest doesn't die away easily.  And that kind of interest isn't build solely on speculation and "beanie baby" enthusiasm.  It is about an established infrastructure, complementary technologies, and momentum.  Litecoin, the most established alternative, is trading at about 4 dollars, some 50X behind.
So yeah, Bitcoin might not win the race.  Certainly interest might wane.  But go to zero?  Be replaced by another alt coin?  Or the banks? (whose servers don't even run outside banking hours, on weekends, or holidays, and don't communicate with each other except at the end of the day?  Really?)
The growth in value will bring people in.
The services and advantages of Bitcoin payments will continue to grow.  And that will keep people in the system.
That's my bet.  And yeah, I could be wrong.

This is even a better argument for the value of Bitcoin.  Bitcoin does the following:
* Facilitates transactions without centralized third parties
* Protects holders from centralized third parties inflating the supply 
* Facilitates the security of your holdings through signed transactions and distributed accounting.
The thing about "Theories" or "Philosophies" of value is that for them to hold water, when you encounter something that does have value, whatever theory or philosophy of value you have ought to identify the thing as having value.   Say I have $100 dollars.  Most would say that has some value compared to dirt.  Your theory better explain why $100 dollars is worth more than dirt, because most know that $100 is worth more than dirt.
Same goes for Bitcoin.  You have now spun through three very different arguments.  
* You claimed I was misusing definitions.  I wasn't.  Then ..
* You argued that I wasn't using the term "Intrinsic Value" property correctly.  I was.  Then ..
* You jumped to "Subjective Value."   Well, Bitcoin has that too.

@_date: 2013-08-19 16:49:26
I actually have no doubt that some ASIC producers will try and corner the market.  But as the price of Bitcoin goes up, you really need less and less Bitcoin return to make a profit.  That means that while you may never get to make the massive returns the earliest miners made using a server at home, you will still be able to make something with relatively inexpensive hardware.  The hords of people that might be enticed into doing this may overwhelm even government level actions.
As long as you can attract people into the game, the game becomes increasingly difficult to corner.  There isn't any barrier to entry for people with newer and newer hardware.  As long as the price of Bitcoin goes up.
And that is the rub.  The price of Bitcoin protects the system.  While bitcoin is really dirt cheap, we do risk some actor investing far more in hardware than the community can match.  But the very act of such a move may bring more investment off the sidelines, drive up the price of Bitcoin, and suddenly the actor is overwhelmed.  
Lastly, the real danger to any actor seeking to invest with the aim to destroy the Bitcoin ecosystem is the near certainty of failure.  Any such attempt destroys their investment, and only moves the virtual currency from Bitcoin to Litecoin or Feathercoin or SomeYetToBeInventedCoin.  One certainly designed to make their hardware base useless, even if some other hardware base could be developed.  Which makes trying such a move to destroy Bitcoin self defeating, lends credibility to the technology, and actually may drive the adoption of something worse (in their minds) than Bitcoin.  Maybe something with a "Zero Coin" feature baked into the currency from the get go.  
And anyone that has enough money to try should be smart enough to understand this.

It is true.  A Bitcoin address has only a hash of the public key securing the unspent transactions.  But you expose the public key with a spend.  How might that bite you?   The recent suspicions of the NSA tampering with random number hardware weakens the public private key encryption, but ......you need the public key to exploit toss sorry of attack. Which you get if there is a spend.

He says gold has intrinsic value what, a hundred times?
What intrinsic value does Gold have in a vault?  Because the vast majority of Gold just sits in the dark somewhere.  
If you are going to use something as a token system to account for the value of goods and services that can otherwise be used to do wonderful things like make better electronics, cap teeth, wear around your neck and perice body parts, and who knows what else, why not free Gold up for those purposes? 
Why not just use a perfect token system (like Bitcoin) to account the value of reserves in banks and to sit in savings accounts.  That would free up Gold to actually be used.  To actualize all these intrinsic values that it has.
**If Gold's most useful, most common, dominate intrinsic value is to sit in a vault, then Bitcoin's intrinsic value is to sit in the Blockchain.**
What's the difference?

No, a bank does not protect your money from key loggers and such.  This is called [Identity Theft](  Banks don't really protect against this.


Yes, quite.  Of course, Bitcoins *can't* be stored in a mattress.  They must be kept in a "wallet" which might be viewed as an account.  Yes, that account can be managed by a Bank.  Or you can manage it yourself.  Or you could have a number of companies manage the account where none of them have what it takes to access it, but you have an application that puts the pieces together.  All sorts of innovations are possible with Bitcoin (as they are with any other currency, were the Banks willing to provide them, but they are not).




But always upward in periods of high inflation and instability. Furthermore, gold isn't a currency, at least it hasn't been at all since 1971, and not really since the Federal Reserve, and its decline as use as currency began with removing legal tender status of foreign currencies in 1857, and establishing the "Gold Exchange Standard" late in the 1800's, 


Not at all.  You are right that this is how investment banks make money.  It isn't how the small investor makes money;  they are not given returns that even account for inflation today.
Or maybe you can demonstrate how any interest paid by a Bank Account today even approaches the 2 to 3 percent CPI (never mind the *real* inflation rate, which is always much higher!).




Actually I am referring to the "Tax" of the article, where depositors are being forced to bail out a bank for decisions that they had nothing to do with.  I do not mean to imply taxes are in any way uniformly unjustified.  Obviously governments need to tax.  But the current financial orientation of government policy is very destructive.  If a Currency, like Bitcoin, allows for innovation in financial transactions that cut out banks and financial institutions and governments where there really should be no interference, then this is a good thing.  Using funds for horrible things like murder and terrorism, child porn, whatever should be punished via the law.  Given that most (nearly all) of this is done in Dollars today, Bitcoin clearly isn't at fault.




Actually, if you read the news through the 2008 crisis, HSBC money laundering, Interest rate fixing, Mortgage securities, etc. etc. etc.  Then my statement isn't FUD.  The issues are very complex, but there isn't *any reason at all* to trust banks or the Federal Reserve, or even our own DOJ.  Obama can't even prosecute at the levels of Bush before him.  Who reduced prosecutions relative to Clinton.
Lastly, you cannot conflate Bitcoin with Banks.  Banks can provide all their services via Bitcoin as easily as they can with Dollars.  Bitcoin is a currency, not a replacement of the Banking System.  Well, except that it provides piles of flexibility that Banks have refused to offer.  It provides a defined and transparent system of inflation and management, unlike that provided by the Federal Reserve.  It promises a currency that cannot be manipulated for the interests of the Financial Sector or the Government.
Lastly, by [Thiers' Law]( the dollar hasn't a chance. "These examples show that in the absence of effective legal tender laws, Gresham's Law works in reverse. If given the choice of what money to accept, people will transact with money they believe to be of highest long-term value."

The way I started to attack this problem was to consider what happens when they are wrong.  
Basically, if they have 30 percent of the power, and so does another selfish chain, then when they make a move based on a block appearing on the public chain, they will be wrong ~30 percent (plus 1/2 the selfish advantage, if any).  
Also when they finally try and claim the whole chain, again they will be wrong 30 percent of the time, losing all their effort.
This is kinda annoying math... I could in theory beat it out, but I think I will go for a run instead.

I believe alternate currencies are critical for exploring features and behaviors of distributed currency systems.  
Also, I would underscore the need to have some place to store value besides traditional currencies in the event that Bitcoin is attacked.  
Lastly, I think allowing Bitcoin to increase in value to thousands of dollars might be too much too fast to allow adoption to proceed.  I know that it is divisible, but people are already looking at the hoards early adopters are sitting on, and questioning the wisdom of making these guys/gals unbelievably rich.  Alternate currencies can slow the growth of value, allowing some pressure to be managed. 
(And the early adopters are still going to get unbelievably rich.)
Lastly, it is unlikely Bitcoin is the perfect implementation of digital money.  Something is going to replace it, even if we still call that Bitcoin.  Alternate currencies are going to have to exist to do this properly.

So many problems here.  First off, there is no proof that Isaiah 53 was ever taken literally prior to Christianity as a prophesy.  Again, Prophesies answer questions after the fact, not before.
The "Bible" is also a collection of books that were selected by individuals I am pretty sure you would otherwise disregard.  And the books themselves do not validate the canon.  
What books are included and not included vary across very old Christian traditions.  To take too hard a line on what is in the Canon or not in the Canon isn't really any different than those Christians that used to claim you had to read the King James version of the Bible.  These are not opinions based on Scripture.
So I go back to the early Church and reasonable textual criticism of the manuscripts.  And I look for *core teachings*.  There is no scripture that says, "Thou shalt accept these 66 books to be saved".  But there are plenty of texts that imply ignoring those in need is a very bad idea.

So I bought some cuff links and a money clip from a store in the French Quarter who takes Bitcoin.  25 bucks each. 
The total transaction cost for a $50 Credit Card purchase would be 3 percent + 30 cents, or about $1.80.  And with Credit Cards, you have to worry about chargebacks.  
Exchanging Bitcoin worries you?  Well, if you used Bitpay (who charges a flat .99 percent fee, no setup charges, no minimum charge), your cost would be 50 cents. And they deposit USD directly into your account, no chargebacks. 
On the other hand, if you just accept Bitcoin directly (As David's in New Orleans does) [here I flash my new money clip to demonstrate my purchase] your transaction cost is ... nothing, zero, zilch!!  That's because the customer pays the transaction fee with Bitcoin, not you as the vendor. In this case, I paid (as the customer) a transaction fee of .0001 BTC, or roughly 1 cent.  I hardly noticed.
And David's received the full .4 Bitcoins we agreed upon in full.  
Just like cash.  And I could have made the same transaction over the Internet.  And as far as the merchant is concerned, I could be anyone in the world.  Yet the transaction fee is still so low!
That 1 percent fee for processing?  Oh, yeah, that company is BitPay.  B-i-t-p-a-y dot com.

@_date: 2013-08-15 13:15:39


No. Higher and faster rises in value imply you should save BTC rather than borrow. And at 1.3 billion, nobody much is being paid in BTC.








In an inflationary setting (the last 40 years) flat and falling real wages, rising real cost of living, decimated savings and pensions, education costs, medical costs, investment bubbles, and the rising income gap are real problems. 
This is because 1) we underestimate inflation by ignoring real costs of goods and services people actually have to budget for, 2) debt based monetary systems provide a "house" game where the financial sector and big business has a built in advantage over the rest of the economy, and 3) the regulations to control that advantage are written by, and enforced by the very same privileged sector, with no checks and balances from the broader interests in the economy.
About the only thing inflationary systems do well is make loans. But as you might now know, the financial sector doesn't ever expect to be profitable from the interest on loans. They package them up and trade them as securities, and use derivatives to leverage trading on top of these and other assets, to a denominated a derivatives market 10x the size of the GDP of the world.
Risk is as poorly measured as inflation, making the assumptions in the derivatives market especially dangerous, as we saw in 2008. And we may be setting up for a repeat performance.
All of that to say, if you want to talk about loans in a world of inflexible monetary systems, then do that. Or in the"rubber ruler" world of central banks. But setting up a straw man between the two systems is dumb. Obviously consumers are going to take loans out in dollars and save in BTC as long as the system allows them to do so. 
Because everyone wants money that goes up in value over money losing value.
Except those at the top of the current system.

Actually Rule 16.1.5 is really tough on this selfish algorithm:


When we do the [Passing Bitcoin Around the World]( we pass the bitcoin on only one confirmation from one person to the next person in the chain.  So as the traffic on Bitcoin in transactions gets heavier, some transaction in a block on the main block chain will get spent by a transaction in the next block.
If I am reading this right, most of the time you would not be able to replace two blocks if someone is moving Bitcoin from address to address in every block.
Am I reading this right?
@_date: 2013-11-07 01:46:18
So let's try this one for size.
Let's consider what happens if two pools run the same selfish algorithm.  After all, if there is an incentive to join a pool running it, there is just as much an incentive to convert to the algorithm.
Now neither pool knows for sure what the real length of blocks are out there, and now cannot make an informed decision about what to do.
Furthermore, a pool could get 3 blocks ahead, but only release 2.  And there would be an incentive to have as many transactions as possible in those blocks to up their complexity and thus up the length of their chains.
I haven't done the math yet, but figured I'd put this out there (after my embarrassing failure to consider how the blocks are hashed...).  If there is some embarrassing miscalculation here on the intersection of two or three of these selfish pools, it would be better to snag it fast.
My gut feeling is that if you can't make a decision when to fold, and when to release your blocks, you can't really do any better than your original 30 percent.   Pretty much having two pools running the selfish algorithm should (I think) eliminate their respective advantages...

First of all, there is no doubt that adoption rates for Bitcoin is going to drive merchant acceptance.  And right now merchant and customer acceptance is rising.  And it is rising fast.  Still really tiny though.
If Bitcoin could cover a significant number of sales, say 10 percent, then a one percent savings, (adding 1 percent profit to 10 percent of their sales) is reason to adopt Bitcoin.
And I disagree with you about gross profit vs net profit.  Saving one percent on transaction fees adds directly to the net, as it Applies to the whole transaction, regardless of any other effort a merchant might use to lower costs.
Lastly charge backs and credit card fraud hit big retailers more than many small businesses.  I am being you friend with the one charge back isn't ruining a Best Buy.

Of course they will!
But In a world where BTC freely exchanges for fiat, going too "fractional" will be the death of a currency.   BTC isn't like Gold:  You can use it for any purchase great or small, so no need for paper to represent heavy Gold, or copper coins to represent tiny gold.  So there is some need for "walking around" money where there is no network services, but where there are... Cards are already replacing Cash.
If a currency cuts of BTC, then people will run to Exchanges and cash out.  The Currency will hyper Inflate, and Bitcoin will replace it in the economy once again.  If they allow a currency value to float, and they inflate it, people will run from it.  If they are reasonable about inflation (so it doesn't differ too much from BTC) then people will use it.
But don't expect another century like the one driven by the Federal Reserve!  Don't think people didn't watch and complain about 98% of the value of the dollar being printed away!

Bingo.  So if you have to have all the transactions.... no gain!


Transaction verification requires all the transactions.  Verifying that an output has not been spent is a proof of the negative.  Can't do that without all the information.  Even if nodes only contain some chains, and there are many, many chains, you are still then communicating all transactions to all chains.  You don't save network overhead.
Now you just need big systems to manage the databases of transactions (built by pushing all the transactions into the database).  This isn't effectively any harder than to do against the one block chain as it is to do against many.  And in fact, the many chains open the system up to vulnerabilities that a single chain doesn't have.  For example, you can have a big player attack a single chain out of the many.  If a 51 percent attack is effective against one chain, a 51 percent attack need not take on all of the network.  If there are 100 chains, then they only need to take on 1 percent of the network, making a particular chain out of 100 roughly 100x more vulnerable than the single chain architecture we have now.
Summary:  No benefit (all transactions with unspent outputs are needed for verification) and more vulnerable (allowing attackers to attack a single chain rather than the whole of the network).

Addresses are created from private keys, and you are right.  You can create a million of them from a "single identifier".  But if that identifier is known to anyone else, your protocol is not secure.
Furthermore, anyone looking at the public keys you generate cannot trace them back to the source "identifier".  Unless they have your private keys, and again, your system isn't secure.


I don't have a clue what "truth" you are talking about.  And if you Read the parable of the sheep and the goats in Matthew 25, it does not appear that knowledge that you are doing right or doing wrong matters as much as the doing.  So anything that distracts you from the doing good is at best a distraction, and at worse a heresy.

An analysis of many of these recessions show them to have causes beyond a central bank's ability to resolve.  Like the recession of 1807.
How is this proof central banks are better?  The economies of the 1800s are nothing like the economy today.  And what we know about them doesn't fit a "central bank is better" script anyway.
 


The federal reserve is integral to fiscal and tax policy...  And it is run by the same people setting all government policies... Why and how can you separate them?

What is "conspiratorial" about observing ICE acting against Dwolla and Mt Gox (two tiny little bit players in finance) over what appears to be a technicality (since Dwolla who actually transmits money between parties is a registered Money Transmitter), but not acting against other, more clearly criminal players?
This isn't a "conspiracy".  It is just a continued stream of bogus behavior by ICE who doesn't seem to ever maintain a reasonable size of respose / size of the crime  ratio. 
So no "conspiracy."  Just stupidity.

They create money from nothing, and loan it to Banks mostly.  Or they use it to purchase mortgage securities (i.e. QE3), or they loan it to financial service banks, or they buy US treasuries (i.e. QE3).  The profits of the Federal Reserve go to the US Treasury.  That would be interest paid on money created from nothing and loaned out to the most wealthy actors in the economy at the best rates.


Actually 2 percent per year.  That has devalued the dollar by ~97 percent over the last 100 years.  The dollar we are using today has the buying power of ~13 cents ... roughly in my lifetime.


I have no idea what you are trying to say here.

[Productivity increased last year]( as it has nearly every year for as far back as we measure such things.  This isn't factored into CPI however, so we get a much more cheering CPI than reflects the actual inflation of the currency.
One of the reasons I look to a measure of value like Bitcoin is that I think we play games with the numbers to hide the real effects of monetary policy, particularly since 1971...

Fud of central bankers.  Currency based on commodities rather than debt do not require interest to be paid against every unit of currency.  The real question is, "what will bankers do for a living if they are not being paid interest on every unit of currency, and since the value of currency remains with the worker so they don't have to deposit all their money with bankers, bankers don't get a free supply of money to lend back at interest?"
Answer: they will have to get a real job, and work for a living.

You can save, and you can make a profit.  Costs fall, allowing you to keep more money back.  A great product can coax savings back into the market.  Prices fall, which expands the money supply.
Just like you adjust for inflation in your charts, you can adjust for deflation.  You will end up with more self investment (as more people will have savings) and stronger markets to make sells to (because people have resources).
A company that manages to maintain say 10 Bitcoin in savings over five years will actually show a profit! After all, they paid everyone, and dividends (because increases in company value will not impress investors if that is in fact lower numbers of Bitcoin).  Even if that drops to 8 Bitcoin, that might be a profit in real value (even if technically a loss).
I do think it will be a very different world.  But I don't think it will be bad.  Just jarring after living so long under the manipulation of currency by central banks.

It's value measures demand (regardless of why people want it).
Deflation means there is an increase of demand for the currency.
Inflation means there is a decrease of demand for the currency.
No currency has failed because there was too much demand for the currency.  A currency only fails when demand catastrophically fails (hyperinflation).
So far we have not seen any evidence of catastrophic failure with Bitcoin.  Only panic sales from immature or uninformed day traders expecting such a failure, which has yet to materialize.
People will want to hold and use currency that does not degrade, even if the loss of demand for the currency is small and predictable.  Go purchase anything infrequently (years between purchases) and the sticker shock is real.  Or go buy computer equipment, where you wonder in amazement what you can buy for your dollar compared to just a few years ago!
People hate the first experience, and love the latter!

What I meant was a literal prophesy of specifically and uniquely of Jesus.  There are no examples of prophesy being understood and acted upon prior to fulfillment unless the prophet is right there explaining it as it unfolds (like Nathen and David... And in that case the acting did no good... The child died).  For example, Jesus was prophesied as coming back "quickly".  I for one figure if over 2000 years can be defined as quickly, I'm not likely to understand more cryptic prophesies ahead of time...

If you are the only unknowns in the graph, then certainly.  But that is true of all financial systems.  And it isn't all that likely with Bitcoin since there isn't a requirement for parties to know who they are transacting with.  
So assume company X and company Y have published Bitcoin addresses.  They pay everyone and accept payments from everyone into and out of single addresses.  X pays me and I pay Y.  What can the world see.
So one can see a payment from company X to an address of mine out of many payments.  Then a transaction splitting that payment into several addresses (as I allocate Bitcoin to funds for my purposes but nobody knows that's the purpose or that they paid me to begin with unless X blabs about me).  Then from those a payment to Company Y.  (The same here... Many sources are feeding into Y.  Unless Y blabs about me, i am only one of many). 
My activity in between X and Y is mine, but who can tell?  And even if X and Y blab, all the other addresses are unaccounted for.  Did I pay someone? Do I still control those funds?  If I always use fresh addresses, no one can see which set of addresses are savings, are spendings.  If my change is also sent to a new address, then is a unknown payment? Or do I still control those funds?
To expose me, all addresses must be documented to eliminate others as options from transactions I use to do my own accounting.  And X and Y have to blab that they are paying/being paid by me, or the same applies... Their organization of funds and control of funds in other addresses is just as unknown without auditing each transaction.

I guess if you can't prove your point that credit cards are  just as secure as bitcoin, you have to go somewhere.
Nobody said Bitcoin could pick up the slack for 40 million bad cards less than a week before Christmas.  But not even the Credit Card companies can do that.  You have a royal mess here, and there isn't a solution for anyone holding one of these cards.  Other than to hope 1) Merchants don't get scared of credit cards, and 2) nobody steals their card and makes charges that might be hard to figure out as being fraudulent.  
Dem be the facts, brother.  Plain and simple.
And screwups like this one is going to make pointing the finger at various issues with Bitcoin to be really hard to make stick.  Heck, with 40 million cards lost, I wouldn't be surprised if there wasn't a billion dollars lost over all of this.  That would only be a little more than 20 dollars per card....

What Peter Schiff doesn't understand is the limits of Gold as money.
* You can't use Gold *directly* for purchases.
* If you can't use Gold directly, you use a certificate.
* You can't transact over distance with either Gold or a certificate.
This means someone issues paper (certificates) to stand in for Gold.  And when transacting over distance, you use third parties to handle certificate "transfers".
And in a dozen or two years, you have central banks all over again.  
In the history of money we have been through this cycle numerous times already, just in the USA.  Twice within the Federal Reserve, if you count the Gold "reforms" during the depression and Nixon's cutting off of Gold for what they were, fundamental and radical changes to the contract that the dollar ( i.e. the "Federal Reserve Note") was supposed to represent.
Bitcoin cuts all that out by being more secure, and transaction ready directly in the hands of parties engaged in transactions.
With Bitcoin you lose whatever the "intrinsic" or "objective" value of Gold might be as an industrial or commercial raw material.  You gain whatever the "intrinsic" or "objective" value of the perfect token system Bitcoin represents, which cannot be counterfeited or double spent.
Gold can literally be counterfeited via coating tungsten with Gold, or via counterfeit certificates, and it has been historically double spent over and over via the mass issue of gold certificates against an insufficient reserve.  
**tl;dr:** Gold sucks as money, as history proves.  Bitcoin is taking over *purely on its merits as a better form of money*.

Everyone should contribute to support government where it is needed.  And mostly it isn't.  


And I owe them nothing either.  So?


And if people force them to pay up, why isn't that fair too?  We'd be better off paying as we go honestly rather than borrowing.... 
Why is it fair for business to solicit government advantages, but not people?  Hint: we shouldn't be doing either and both are equally bad.  


The people are having their wages lowered systematically by a system of corrupt central bankers, big bankers, and traders.  Are you not aware of the LIBOR scandals? Credit default swap price fixing?  That's 800 *trillion* in market prices fixed to skim money off loans and commodities.

Right now, I mostly hold.  If I had a good way to cycle through Bitcoin, I would hold all my money in Bitcoin, and only convert to dollars for payments when I had to.  And I think most businesses would (if highly liquid) provide discounts for payment in Bitcoin over credit cards (costing them money) or keep wealth in bank accounts (costing them money, restricting their use of money).
Why would anyone want to hold a depreciating asset when Bitcoin is clearly (despite the swings) an appreciating asset?  For example, in January, Bitcoin was just 13 dollars.  If after the "crash" I spent any of my January money, I would have still been ahead (50 dollars per BTC instead of 13).  Even if I might have lost value immediately some of my April $266 dollar BTC, I am pretty confident we will be over $200 in May sometime.
And the rich are not stupid.  Once Bitcoin values get up to $1000 or $10000 per coin, the rich will be storing their wealth in Bitcoin too.  Why let investment banks take huge cuts in investments to earn a return when you can get a return by just holding your wealth?  That sounds horrible to Paul Krugman, but the calculus doesn't end there.
Why not invest your wealth *directly* so you get *all* the returns?  Why go through investment banks if you can hold real wealth of your own?  Bitcoin makes that possible, because you can *save* and not lose value.
Why take out loans?  If you can save, and your savings actually do hold value, and compound in value directly in proportion with the economy, why not save, THEN buy (no loans!).  Why should massive amounts of our economy concentrate wealth in third parties? Just so they can print money?

The global money supply is about 60 Trillion for the M2 number (best I can tell from multiple sources; sorry not citing any).  While there is some reason to criticize using M2 (timed deposits don't require Bitcoin to remain in an account), it is at least a starting place.
Bitcoin would then have to be valued at 5.4 million a coin.
Since many "timed deposits" might in fact shift into Bitcoin, I think that number may very well be very fair.  But BTC will not take 100% of the global money supply.  Other crypto currencies will arise and take some part of the market share.  How much is hard to say.  They could edge Bitcoin completely out, or they might just die off by global consent.  Past some point, the infrastructure behind crypto currencies will decide the winners.

Bitcoin is a technology and a currency that:
* Provides for transactions without banks, credit card companies, or Paypal
* Neither party has to set up an account with anyone but themselves
* Provides for micro payments to anyone in the world with a connection to the Internet
* Is a deflationary currency (like a Gold Standard) without the drawbacks of Gold
* * Environmentally Friendly
* * Does not require huge vaults to secure
* * Does not take a useful resource out of Industrial use
* Is not easily controlled by Bankers and the Financial Sector

Feel free.  I'd choose the Long Depression 1873-1879.  It isn't going to make a case for worse economic events when compared to the last 100 years.  In the last 100 years, all economic crashes occurred under the oversight of the Central Banks of the world.  And the current rising Income gap?  Also under the policies of the central banks.
I think you may find it difficult to explain why, with the most productive workforce in the history of man, we find it increasingly difficult to distribute goods and services across that population.  That wasn't actually a result of the Long Depression; real wages actually rose during and after the Long Depression.  But with the current handling of the 2008 crash?

Money stacked in vaults (offshore accounts, deposited with the federal reserve, held by banks, held by corporations) doesn't not immediately cause prices to rise.  Because it isn't in the economy.
If we have another crisis we could see cascades of defaults on the hundreds of trillions of dollars leveraged on that printed money wiping out all those balances. 
Or if inflation begins to pick up (destroying the value of money held off the market), those massive stores of money might begin to slide into the economy causing greater inflation, and a run to assets to protect the value of those dollars.  It could be the 70's all over again, but that's the optimistic scenario.  Venezuela would be more likely, and 1920's Germany might be the worst... 
There are many scenarios where the current experiment ends badly.  There are not many where we get out of this without some serious problems.

And what is the best way to get Bitcoin?  The best way is for someone to pay you in bitcoin!  Then you are paying 0 transaction fees and 0 exchange fees.
So as adoption rates rise (even if people are just investing), more and more people will think this way too.  And Bitcoin will enter the market place.

Fixed my quote.  All the productivity increases in the economy, effectively lowering prices, is negated by the Monetary Inflation by the Central Banks.  And that is at a CPI of 0.  
Nobody has any idea what the real upward pressure on prices is due to Monetary Inflation, because all we talk about is *Price Inflation*.  That is what CPI measures.




If a bank runs out of Dollars, they can always supply new dollars.  By printing if they have to.
If a bank runs out of Bitcoin, they only have their Bitcoin and, as you say, their guns.  They cannot print Bitcoin.  So they can make people accept gold instead of Bitcoin, or crude oil, or uranium (? really?).  But they cannot just print Bitcoin.

[Intrinsic theory of value](


I touch on this when I refer to the infrastructure required to allow the implementation of the Bitcoin ecosystem.




It is the existence of these factors that is at the heart of my argument for intrinsic value in Bitcion.  And it is the fact that the intrinsic value of Bitcoin indeed exceeds the current market value that makes me very bullish on Bitcoin.
I don't think that it is fair to say intrinsic properties are not equal to intrinsic value.  There is a difference, but they are highly related to each other.

Bitcoin depends on technology, and specifically Moore's law on storage, network bandwidth, and computational power.  At this point, seems like a good bet.  The danger is that Bitcoin *might* grow too fast.  It is going to be close, but I think the inflation curve has enough in it to make it.

Do we really want to claim this kind of logic is valid?


So without any consideration of their evidence, concerns, safety of their families, or even the ethical and moral standards of our culture, we can simply execute people remotely in countries we are not even at war with then go to sleep comfortable in the idea that nobody will figure out how to do the same to us?

You will not be able to spend Bitcoin until its value is firmly established, and the value of Bitcoin is far higher than it is today. To denominate transactions, the party buying has to hold the value being asked. To buy drugs over TOR, Bitcoin is already priced high enough. To fund purchases of B2 bombers? They are 1 billion or so each. We can't expect even the government to hold almost all Bitcoins in existence just to make a single purchase. 
I know the gov isn't going to be using Bitcoin anytime soon, but it makes my point. The way the money supply expands with Gold or Bitcoin is through deflation. This has to happen, but it won't happen forever. The deflation will pause or even reverse if the value outstrips the use of Bitcoin as an investment/currency. This is going to happen from time to time during the adoption phase for Bitcoin.
But as long as Bitcoin's value rises, its desirability as payment medium to a merchant rises. And the bigger the market Bitcoin can support. As opportunities to spend increase, people will. And keep in mind that the barrier to entry for Bitcoin by merchants is very low.
A side note: I will carry on a discussion if you like.  But I will not carry on a meta argument about how well or poorly parties in a discussion are addressing points being made.  So please stop that.  I read your posts and responded clearly and with sound logic to the points you made as I understood them.  Rereading the thread, I don't think I misrepresented what you said, and I didn't ignore ever your central point: that deflation hinders spending of Bitcoin, and could lead to it's failure as a currency.

I think you are kind of missing something.  PayPal could compete with BitPay.
PayPal accepts Bitcoin from the sender, and plays the buyer in dollars, based on the current exchange rate.  Now they *have* their Bitcoin, and they can still get their charge backs from customers.  If they fear Bitcoin losing value, they can cash out on an exchange pretty fast.  But on average holding the Bitcoin has been gaining in value, so holding it shouldn't be a problem.
On the other side, PayPal could accept USD, and pay in Bitcoin to Merchants.  Obviously they would delay payment of the BTC (effectively simulating a charge back ability) but now they are picking up all the traffic where people REAALLLY want Bitcoin for payment.  And the insertion of BTC into the market increases the value of their holdings...
Lastly, they can act as a Third Party on a BTC transaction.  They hold the BTC for some number of days as a protection for the customer.  The merchant who wants to assure their customers can use PayPal's customer protection features for their customers at the expense of a delay in payment.  PayPal can charge some small fee, but they are not sharing that fee with any Credit Card company, nor do they have to extend credit to anyone (They HAVE the BTC!).
Obviously BTC avoids PayPal for transactions with relatives or firms you really trust.  But their gig all along has been to "grease the skids" between parties that don't have too much trust of each other.

Bitcoin does not require more energy than conventional financial systems. At least nobody has proven that it does.  With Bitcoin, the energy used isn't required  to actually process transactions for the most part.  The CPU cycles secure transactions via proof of work based on the number of systems processing transactions; more or less transactions would still require the same energy.

Uhh, no.  The two transitions I mentioned with the dollar amount to restructuring the dollar to avoid the dollar becoming literally worthless.  So while you can bury a dollar in 1910 and dig it up in 2000 and it would have value, it would not represent the same currency.  In 1910 it would be a note granting you the right to so much gold.  In 2000, it allows you to pay a tax.  
This really isn't any different than any sort of restructuring of debt, where debt gets converted into another instrument, because the first instrument no longer exists.


The odds that Bitcoin would be worthless is nearly nil.  Even Beanie Babies still have [some value]( in the market.
Until we see an [actual drop in transactions]( or [client downloads]( I think Bitcoin is pretty solid going on for a few years at least.
Bitcoin is likely to be as difficult to kill off as Bit Torrent, should any organization try to do so.  But the US is about the only actor internationally that would gain from the demise of Bitcoin.  Certainly China and Russia have no reason to kill off Bitcoin.
So Bitcoin's odds of being of zero value or the dollar's odds of being of zero value are both so tiny as to make the question a matter of counting virtual coins that can dance on the head of a pin.

Fundamental difference between "your mattress" and using a Bitcoin Wallet.  I can easily rob your mattress, and you can't put your mattress in your wallet, and you can't use your mattress to conduct transactions with people world wide.  Of course, you can't use your bank account to *easily* conduct transactions with people world wide either, giving rise to payment processors like Credit Cards, which are not secure giving rise to services like Paypal.


That's another issue/concept.  What I am talking about are notes that represent gold (or other commodities) which is what a dollar was in the beginning.  And it may come back to.  But even if I consider dollars as a thing, the printed version is represented as a number in an account held by a third party.  Not a necessity with Bitcoin.


Yet it would be easy to require MtGox to publish their bitcoin addresses, allowing people to easily track the assets that they claim against the blockchain.  When you deposit Bitcoin into MtGox, you can track what is done with it even if they don't publish anything.  Quite a bit of auditing can be done with the Blockchain.  All of that doesn't mean MtGox (or an attack) couldn't empty those addresses in a flash, but at least one could know that the Bitcoin was there and if transferred, where it went.  That is more than you get from banks today.  All you get today from banks (and other institutions) is their word.
And if MtGox emptied their holding addresses, those amounts could be tracked forever until one finally finds out who took the Bitcoin.  Unlike conventional currencies....

Let's assume 1% of the economic activity.


The GDP is roughly 15 Trillion dollars.  For Bitcoin to denominate transactions for 1%, you would need simplistically 1% of 15 Trillion, or a market value of 150 Billion.  This calculation would imply that bitcoin would need to be valued at 150 billion / 11 million, or ~ 13,600 per coin.
But some of that money would be spent multiple times.  (Not every transaction would use unique BTC).  On the other hand, not all money is in play at any point in time.  Given the amount used for speculation and savings (hoarding), maybe you need 4x that amount?
I think that would be a pretty good guess:  Roughly 50K per coin to manage 1% of the US Economy.  Margin of error?  +/- 30K maybe ???
My personal feeling is that once Bitcoin takes 1%, 10% falls really fast, then 50 percent.  The last 50 percent might be held for a while by government and banks.  Or maybe if folds like a house of cards. 
Who really knows?

You should recognize that people speculate on currencies and commodities.  With a large enough market, everyone's behavior evens out more.
If you compare the Dollar with *any other measure* you would see that it is fluctuating wildly in price.  The only issue with BTC is that we are comparing it with the Dollar, rather than comparing the Dollar to BTC.
Now until BTC holds a significant share of the transactional market (which will require BTC to be valued many magnitudes higher than it is now), BTC will be very deflationary, i.e. will rise rapidly in price.  Which makes it a wonderful store of value.
Personally, I save in BTC.  I don't care about the price.  I do spend BTC here and there as I go too.  It just doesn't make sense to me to worry about the waves if I am really willing to bet on the Bitcoin future.

Bitcoin isn't anti-borrowing, true.  But fiat currencies are anti-saving.  And the write up tries to claim that inflation is a good thing.  In fact, inflation forces people to make investments though investment bankers, which charge fees.  Forces them to borrow, which results in fees.  
The whole process tends to concentrate wealth away from the population.  The Big Banks and Las Vegas were built on the fact that the house only needs a percentage or two advantage in the games to win.

An exponential curve doesn't have to be explosive. Percentage increases of the money supply year after year and 2 to 3 percent price inflation every year produces gentle curves yet they are still exponential. So is a slight percentage increase in the income gap year after year. In executive pay year after year. 
In the size of the derivatives market. Really about every thing about monetary policy.
Even the rate of inflation in Bitcoin, which halves every four years is an exponential curve, it just approaches 21 million rather than infinity.
Without balancing increases with contractions, and just running with growth as a policy, we are faced with many exponential growth curves related to population growth, and the way we run the central banks and monetary policy.  These curves are only beginning to produce problems.  But once they gain steam, it will get out of hand fast.

I never said you did.  Credit cards are set up to charge the merchant.  Just like the merchant pays rent, property taxes, fees, and all sorts of other crap.  You as a customer pay for all those things in the form of higher prices.  
Seriously, this is obvious stuff.  MasterCard alone made 1.9 billion in a Quarter.  On fees.  We (as their customers and (for some of us) as merchants) paid those fees.  VISA is bigger(2.547 billion).  American Express is smaller but charges higher fees (1.27 Billion).
It is absurd to thing we as users of their products are not paying the bill here in the form of higher prices.


I have had to refute charges.  Never really had a problem with that, but I am not going to bet I have caught every bogus charge against my account that has ever occurred.  I doubt you have either.  But I know a guy (Chet) who used to work for me, who I am sure never paid a bogus charge.  He would routinely catch penny errors in his bank statements, because he paid that close a watch.  I never had the time.
I have never had to go to PayPal to refute an Internet sell (everyone I have bought from on the Internet has backed their own products).


I have never made a debit purchase on the Internet.  If you process your debit card as a credit card, then the merchant pays the credit card fees.


This is your choice, and I am not arguing that you have to use Bitcoin if you are not comfortable with it.  However, in my experience, I have never had a problem going directly to a Merchant to resolve an issue.  Amazon is really really good about this, as are many other Internet vendors.  I have only gone to the credit card companies to refute bogus charges.  And 100% of those charges were due to the insecure nature of credit card transactions.


That is *exactly right*.  There are pros and cons.  If you read everything I have written, I never said there were not pros and cons to credit cards.  But in that same context, the pros for credit cards are bought and paid for.  They are expensive.  The cons with Bitcoin are easily made up for by the emerging businesses that are providing for Bitcoin the same sorts of protections Credit Cards grant, only for much, much less expense.

I think any rise in awareness will benefit Bitcoin.  What hurts Bitcoin is that people can just go buy some somewhere.

TIL : currencies didn't exist until central banks were invented 150 or so years ago. /sarcasm

No.  Saving (that is what you are really doing) is a legitimate use of a currency.  The fact that Bitcoin is in a rapid deflation (increase in value) is just a bonus for savers!

Wow.  Really?  You were treated badly while on drugs and cruising by a cop you met at a gas station!?!
That is just totally weird.  Austin, huh?
That's just so different from everywhere else, where cops give you hot chocolate and are just really interested in what kind of day you are having!

I tell them that Bitcoin isn't a thing, so it cannot be counterfeited.  It is an encrypted account that allows you to give people an account number that can only be used to pay you.  While you use a secret number that only you have to pay others.  
That way it is more secure than credit cards, and more secure than checks, wires, or anything else a bank or credit card company can give you.
And it depends on the same military grade encryption that the military, government, banks, and industry uses to secure their communications.  If anyone can break that, then all the information in the world is at risk.  Because we don't have anything else (short of more bits) that can secure information better.
