Is there a relation between the Rise/Fall in Eth to the Rise/Fall in Bitcoin still?  The recent Eth graph seems like a warning sign.

Bitcoin was never India's game anyway. Spending \~6000 USD to get a bitcoin is understandable. But Rs 400,000 (4L!) is not easy money in India. Nor can we afford to buy as much hardware for mining etc.

What! You're objectively wrong. GPU prices were on fire uptil just a few months back due to demand from mining. 
There's also a correlation between mining difficulty and cryptocurrency pricing; it's unprofitable now cause the BTC price ain't reaching sustainable levels. There's no particular date in 2013 where it stopped becoming profitable. That's not how it works.

50 million! give me a break. It's false stats and claims like this that make everyone doubt crypto.

Less miners = the flurry to grab coins dies down and so does investor interest.
@_date: 2018-03-28 08:14:34
Draw a straight line from 1 Jan till now and it's over all going down. I'm out soon if it doesn't drop back to 6K within a week. At least could hope for an uptrend. This is frustrating.
@_date: 2018-11-27 11:34:02
Does mining difficulty go down when some miners stop? I think the difficulty would be a function of the total bitcoins mined till date. 
If it takes 3 days for a machine to mine 1 BTC today, then it takes it 3 days even if everyone else stops mining. Isn't it? Or am I missing something.

Except the system can't handle those many transactions due to physical limits of the computing/networking architecture.

lol seriously. This dude is so fucking irritating.
OP, YOU'RE NOT GONNA MAKE IT BIG ON YOUTUBE IN A SIGNIFICANT WAY. Your need-for-approval, demeanour, fake-likes on the videos is fucking irritating. Must be taking a toll on your mental health to push this everyday.
You're  not dumb: Atleast you can read financial charts well. Find a better job for yourself.

Comparing Bitcoin today with what it was five or ten yrs back is one of the silliest things. Conflating just a decade old 'technology' to financial markets or currency and trying to predict how it will work in future is never gonna work. IT IS NOT THE SAME. 
Also the game really changed in 2016-17, You can't mine coins on your laptop anymore. The 'democratization' was killed when these huge mining farms came into the picture. Bitcoin isn't making people in poor countries richer or bringing ethics to currency trade. The people who could afford mining rigs were (on a global scale) rich already. This was, in most parts, always a gold rush. 
If this thing has to last, people have to be honest at least.

Companies usually do this to cover their case in legal disputes. "Look we got audited by a big accounting corp!"
Audits only suggest that they have done the basic (traditional) checks. "Guaranteeing funds security" in crypto space seems like trying a hard sell. False audits were a reason for the 2008 financial crysis.

That's so vague! What do you mean by backing?
Bitcoin is spread all over the world -- so can't be 'adopted' as these country's currency. There would be no benefit to the govt.
If by adopting you mean the countries creating some sort of crypto -- who mines/controls it? Why would the govt want to let the mining control go to some large scale miners abroad?

Yes. You can't transfer money from Indian Bank Accounts into Crypto (It's not just banks' decision, the govt has asked to stop ICOs or exchanging INR to Crypto). But there's no regulation on you accessing websites. The internet is very open there. 
There's also no legal issue if Indians who acquired Crypto earlier or from abroad want to trade it online. Just that they can't purchase it with Indian National Rupee (INR) right now.

Well, we aren't in the early days anymore are we. Clearly the early days wave was in the 'richer' parts of the world too. I'm talking about the general populace of the poorer countries, not a few enthusiasts.

What about the market follows last year's trend and goes up till 1 Jan! 
Ofcourse it won't be that big -- but a good 2 week run would be nice.

Extremely volatile or Predictable? It can't be both. 
You're just throwing buzzwords that don't make any sense.

"Poor countries are buying like crazy but low amounts", nah. Not true at all. 
The field was extremely uneven from the start. The modestly rich alone could afford the mining rigs or initial investments. 
@_date: 2018-12-11 04:58:23
I was talking about influence of mining rigs in early days, and how the 'richer' parts of the world were early adopters. "Large investment" is a relative term too. Few people in poor countries can make large investment in crypto.

Every player seems to be operating in bad faith. 
There are just a handul of people here who seem genuine, and they have a deep understanding of the tech. 
Rest all, even those who claim to hodl or who talk about buying on the next paycheck seem fake.

It started rising just around the time it peaked last year! Could it be that it follows a similar trajectory until atleast the new year? Most probably it's just some big hand trying to play the market though...

That's not the best advice while investing your money tbh. Smartness doesn't mean imply that they won't cheat.

I can tell you with a hundred percent guarantee that 'localcoin' is not more stable than Indian Rupee.
Don't know enough about the South American countries, but I assume it's far from challenging any national currency.
