What is your actual salary? What are your plans now with that much??

So in total how much did you buy in/how much profit have you made so far?

This is bad advice. If I knew I’d be dead in six months I’d take out a big loan and fuck around. No one knows when they’ll die, so we have to rely on average life span, family history of illnesses etc. 
I can guarantee I’ll live until my mid-nineties, but based on my family’s and the nations’ averages, I will act as if I have to plan for that, just in case.

I brought up money because that is what the others were discussing.

I wish there was a public donations charity etc for reducing student loans. I recently found out that my sister has like $130000 in student loans on an interior design degree that she will be paying off for the rest of her life. She was the first born in a family that hadn’t had anyone go to college, and no one to teach her how to avoid predatory loan policies. If I were a millionaire, hands down one of the first things I’d do is free her from being basically a financial slave.

Coinbase fucking sucks ass. It will not let me transfer money from my wallet to my bank account despite numerous tries.

Yeah I don’t really understand why the guy above was suggesting that I don’t pay taxes on earned capital gains. I kind of love having nice roads, hospitals, schools etc
