I didn’t actually lose that money. Could I have sold at a higher price? Yes. Does what actually happened this time mean anything at all? No. I could just as easily have been forced to hold throughout  his entire crash. 
As it stands, though, I was able to transfer that BTC into XRP near the recent swing low.
Ripple...now there’s a coin I believe in.

If a transaction remains unconfirmed for a few days/a week, it drops off the chain. 
I don’t know what happens when it drops off the chain.
But Bitcoin from a place that allows instant conversion to Fiat and don’t try to buy anything with it because the fees are outrageous.

While I didn’t know where it was. It was floating out, unconfirmed, and I had no idea what that meant. I know now.

I’m ALWAYS desperately careful about that, but still sweat it when I finally hit “send.”

Which I thankfully averaged in to over the past week and a half to two weeks in an attempt to insulate myself from surprise regulatory fallout.
Unfortunately, Ripple is now 60% of my entire crypto portfolio and I’ve little to no idea where to put money. Everything else is just getting teamed by futures traders.

Yes, you have lost whatever the amount was it’s gone down since the transfer was initiated.

It’s like how in Italy it’s illegal to work on Sundays.
That’s what top gear tells me, at least.

You guys keep this insider trading shit up you’re going to get crypto regulated out of existence.

Took me 19 hours to send a few thousand dollars the other day. Most nerve wracking and helpless feeling I think I’ve felt in a good, long while. 
I shall transact only with LTC from now on. BTC is functionally useless to me as anything other than a trading hobby. 
Trying to come to terms with losing a few grand through your own stupidity (for trusting something as shady as crypto) is one hell of a task.

The entire thing is a meme.
I wrote elsewhere that I took $10,000 and split it across every single coin listed on Bittrex. $50-$60 a pop.
On December 19th, 2017, I had almost half a million dollars.
I held a bit too long, but still got out with a few hundred thou. 
Anyone who was on /biz/ in March of last year knew about DGB. The memes were relentless. Anyone could have turned their $50 into almost $30,000. 
It’s super fun if not a bit maddening at times.

I haven’t always bought the dip...
I have consistently put money in every single week over the past year. That money is up almost 700% still. I’m not MAD, but damn, these “dips” can be brutal.
It hardly matters, though, because I do not
HODL the dips in the likes of RDD, DGB, and SC. My 60,000-70,000% gains there, in those three alone, offset any and every single dollar I’ve ever “lost” Times at least 5.
Then, there’s the 23 other coins I own which rose between 8,000 and 20,000%....too bad I only had a few hundred in at a time....

Srsly, though...
This thing was, at one point, worth 14x what I paid. 
Is many MOONS to Bork at, fren, much happy
