Time will tell. It will be all a matter of user experience. If it is easy to select the shop, create the channel, pay and confirm it's paid effortlessly... then it may work. 
On-chain, or off-chain, will not matter as long as it works, fast, cheap and secure.

I see your point, but I think that the debate if the microtransactions belong to the blockchain is more ideological or a design preference than a technical problem. It can be done, but maybe doesn't want to be done. 
There will be multiple approaches just like in the past with every new technology and the market will choose what fits better.

Basically because it hasn't happened yet. 
 LN will only add more complexity, and since we haven't seen any implementation working, neither any wallet or other sw enabling it.

But you know that people has done it before and not only that, it is in the roadmap for Core to increase the block size at some point.
It is possible to have a store of value and a usable coin for micropayments. If bitcoin does not excel at either then others will take over as the demand is real.

Time will tell, but I'm inclined to believe that conservation of energy prevails. So if I have to make more effort to set up a smtp server, send an email, get confirmation, open the channel, pay, get confirmation... Or just agree to pay with PayPal, put my pin, and voila... I think most people will go with the easiest and less effort consuming option.

Opening channels is a mess.
We haven't been able to find a good way to deal with wallets, transfers and exchanges that anyone can use (including old people) and now we are going to complicate it even more. 
As you say, lots of pieces yet to be found in this puzzle.

"with complete coverage of the spec". But that's not what OP is mentioning.  Neither how does this set us in the roadmap.
Anything could be a test. It's about the scope, and that's not clear, so it is not news.

Expecting it in 5months is hype. And we don't need hype and expectations that cannot be met. That's more damaging than cautious estimations.

So instead of letting other alt coins cover the gaps of functionality missing in btc you will be able to implement the functionality off-chain on BTC. Probably that will provide hefty fees to those running them, and wipe out most altcoins (developers will move from the altcoins to btc-LN, that's all. But now tose that make money running BTC will take the cut the otherwise was going to be split over many coins.)
For some LN is an attack to the original vision. For others is an attempt to monopolize or to imitate other altcoins. Some claim that only the rich will be able to use the on-chain transactions.  Others trust that it is the only way to solve the escalation challenge (high fees, slow transfers). 
The reality? Time will tell. It can potentially change BTC. For good, for bad, or something in the middle.

Last time I checked this was not a religion, yet.
@_date: 2017-12-02 22:49:59
You already have many coins that provide that, better, cheaper and faster than bitcoin.
If LN is not ready by the time others catch up in adoption, then btc will end up as the mere store of value that some want.

It will change things, may create a new market, or go nowhere and end up crashing. time will tell.

A good healthy market for Altcoins benefits everyone.
There will be room for more than one cryptocurrency in the future and the multiple tecnologies that are being tested at the moment will benefit the whole ecosystem. 
Just don't invest your life savings on any of all this. Because this is the largest experiment ever made and it can very well go bust at any time.

They are running a different business model, and at the moment it's viable as long as we continue in the especulative phase we are in now. The only thing that bitcoin can do is to make some change that makes it not viable for the miners to mine both and needs them to commit to one. Doable? Yes. Feasible or advisable? Time will tell.
Meanwhile some of the points made by both sides are true. High fees and waiting time, and escalation in general for the same amount of traffic  is a problem  for both and for any other coin until they proved otherwise.

It is not a matter of survival, but also valuation. None of the companies that survived the telco bubble have recovered their pre-bubble value. So while Bitcoin will most probably survive, it will not have the same value. A correction of 30% is normal, so we should expect a correction of 60-70% at least if we expect it to follow a similar pattern.

What you need to see is what is the volume that thy contribute with. 3 exchanges account for 80%of the money that comes from China. How much of the CNY was the market cap? 30%? 40? This rally was driven by Korean and Chinese. Plus it was mostly new money. 
So we will see 40-60%of the market cap disapear. A few people will be scared to come back until it's green (what, 20%?)
It'll take a week or two until CNY finds its way to other exchanges (I'm sure those that accept CNY outside of China will make a killing). But that will be about 10-20%of the market cap lost, and it will only help to stabilize it. 
If the Korean regulator does the same, then we are really fucked. 
In overall this was a good thing, as we were in a bubble. In November we are set for more drama, so people might just wait until that's cleared. 
This dip might be the wake-up call for the core and bitcoin cash to stop the bullshit and realize they need to work for the benefit of all. Or maybe they do the opposite because bitcoin cash needs bitcoin to fail so they survive. 
Holding might be good.for.some, but not.for.all, depending if you need that money or not.

You are wrong there. Fiat is more stable as you can see how fiat valuation does not swing up and down as the cryptocoins do.  They are not stable yet, and they can dip only because of FUD and a couple of tweets is enough.
The word you are looking for is resilient.

At the moment, as far as I know, US is the only place where you have to pay tax over gains. It is not regulated in Europe, neither elsewhere. 
The chinese and koreans have been driving this big rally, so anything affecting them will affect the market.
Now, the rebound is not being driven by them, but by the american /global exchanges. What does that mean? not sure to be honest. Maybe institutional money pumping in.
@_date: 2017-09-16 07:31:59
They have no reason, but they may regulate it so to be able to tax it. It is a lot of money going into it and countries will try to get their hands into it. And it is easy if you just make them have a license, and a small fee applied. 
Such news are possible and would create havoc among the market.  
I'm not saying it will. I am identifying risks that threat a constant growth scenario (that will not happen anyway)

It's funny how both sides claim to follow Satoshi's vision, just different parts of it. 
BTC claim the vision was for small blocks, therefore they add SW that was certainly not in the vision. 
BCH claim SW and centralized development is against the vision so they support bigger blocks as it is closer to the vision. 
And the reality is that neither solve the escalation issues and no real solution has been found yet. So all this debate is quite useless if it wasn't because there are billions of dollars on the table and everyone is just speculating. 
Bigger elephants than btc have fallen at hands of better technology competitors. It happened before, it may happen again. Don't put your life savings into it.

Adoption has gone down in the last year's, certainly. Bitcoin used to be about giving control to people and the last years has become a pure speculative asset due to people like op.
Using it spreads adoption and that makes it worth it. Otherwise it's tulips.

I think that many fail to understand that Bitcoin is just an experiment. Cryptocoin have a bright future, but for real life you will see the current economic and political players embrace cryptocoins of their own, and they will be the community. 
As you say, all this drama shows how Bitcoin is flawed and not up to what a more universal coin needs. 
@_date: 2017-07-22 11:03:48
The problem I see is that the two points you consider are contradicting each other:


It can not be unchanged, and at the same time be continuously improved. The reality is that all cryptocoins are software developments, and therefore are in constant development, for as long as there are developers behind them.
So the Bitcoin will, by definition, not remain the same. It may be constant on some properties but by definition it must be changing constantly to adapt to the technology, issues etc. 
So can BTC become the new gold standard?  Only when it reaches certain maturity that is years away. Just consider how all the work that is done now could just be thrown into the bin with the arrival of quantum computers.  Or how other technologies could disrupt it, or even the creation of a virus that affects the blocks and forces to accept corrupted ones. 
Be wary and cautious. This is not as good as the fanboys say, neither as bad as the doom preachers claim. 
@_date: 2017-07-22 16:21:40


True, you are right. The changes are on the additions to the top layers. So the drama that we are seeing these days will become more rare as it matures, but there will be still room for drama, that's for sure.


We change the apps, and software implementing ipv4 to address the security gaps identified. But I see your point, BTC will reach a level of maturity one day that will make it stable enough to rely on it as e-gold. 
But yes, we agree that there will be a gold standard on the internet at the end, or for a while. What I question is if BTC will be the one, or if another will take the throne.
Until then we will keep seeing heavy speculation, attacks and drama. 
It's a fascinating ride.
@_date: 2017-07-21 12:40:30
We need to understand and acknowledge that right now what is driving the price of Bitcoin is speculation. There is currently no value in Bitcoin because two factors: High fees, and time to process transactions.  If I want to buy something I want no fee and immediate transacion, and now Bitcoin cannot do either. 
That's why acceptance and usage of Bitcoin for actual good's transactions has declined ( and rightfully so. 
The value of Bitcoin right now is justified by a promise of what it will be able to do in the future, but it is not able to do yet. So it is a gamble. It is mere and pure speculation.
And Bitcoin benefits can be provided by other technologies/altcoins, so its only advantage at the moment is the current market cap, and that volatile too.
So don't get too attached to bitcoin, educate yourself and be cautious. If you want to invest/gamble, do so knowingly of the risks. If you want to contribute to its adoption, then get involved in the community and be openminded enough to realize that BT might not be the best technical solution and might need to be abandoned in favor of other.
