You could put together about 10 rx570's or maybe rx580's to mine Ethereum for around $2500. They would generate about a buck a day each at today's market prices, so about $10 a day or so, minus whatever electricity costs you. The rx580's would cost a bit more but would also make more, obviously. Where I live, I'd spend about a buck or so per day running a rig like this.
At the moment, Ethereum is more profitable to mine than Bitcoin. Correct me if I'm wrong.

Yeah it's decent. You'll probably get a better price on CoinSquare anyway, but the fees are a little high. Just do an e-transfer to your bank account. It's pretty slick, actually.
@_date: 2019-03-26 23:14:13
Just get them to open a Coinbase account &gt; send them the Bitcoin &gt; they sell the Bitcoin &gt; they send the money to their account. Simple.
@_date: 2019-03-26 23:15:25
Or... Open a CoinSquare account. Send the Bitcoin to your CoinSquare account. CoinSquare tends to trade slightly higher than Coinbase.
Sell the Bitcoin for CAD on CoinSquare. Send the funds to your own bank account. Even simpler.
Hold your Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-24 21:15:17
That's not easy to answer briefly, and again, I'm no expert. I'll give a very simplistic answer from what I understand:
Segwit is an abbreviation of segregated witness, meaning, the confirmation of transactions is segregated - sent to another place - another chain - whereby it is confirmed without bogging down the main chain that Bitcoin is running on. This basically frees up space on the chain for more transactions.
Feel free to correct me. I recognize this is a very simplistic explanation.
@_date: 2017-08-16 19:49:38
It's like when I explained buying Bitcoin to my parents-in-law. They thought I would now have ties to the Mafia lol
@_date: 2017-08-25 03:26:58
Lol yeah that's a little better explanation. Kinda complicated in comparison heh. In the end, though, it's basically freeing up the chain, right?
@_date: 2017-08-24 16:21:36
Maybe you remember when you first bought an HDTV, but there weren't a lot of HD channels? We're at that stage now. Bitcoin is now capable of faster, cheaper transactions via Segwit but the new "HD channels" aren't all ready yet. It will improve dramatically. You just need to give it a few weeks.
@_date: 2017-08-24 20:42:08
I'm no expert on this, but my impression is that many wallets are ready for segwit, but it's just not visible in the GUI yet. I am thinking they're waiting until they're sure everything is working as intended.
@_date: 2017-08-24 20:18:11
Heh maybe that's analogous to 2X?

What about cryptocurrencies that are inflationary and do not have a fixed supply?
@_date: 2017-08-24 18:29:00
The channels would be the infrastructure that allows for segwit transacting to actually occur such as segwit-enabled wallets and the miners who process the transactions, among other elements. It's ready to go, it just takes time for everyone to get on board.
@_date: 2018-06-30 20:10:45
What about cryptocurrencies that are deflationary and do not have a fixed supply?
@_date: 2018-06-30 20:30:37
Sorry I meant inflationary... There are some currencies that don't have fixed supplies and are inflationary.
@_date: 2018-06-30 18:23:08
You think so? Is there room for both?
@_date: 2018-06-30 19:24:19
Not if you stay in crypto. Only if you switch back to fiat.
You're thinking short term. It's true, at the present moment, most people need to switch their crypto back into fiat at some point. The article is about the future of money, which might not be as far off as some imagine.
Crypto is only so volatile because the market is tiny. Over time as it grows and more money is in it, creating more liquidity, prices should eventually be less volatile. Who knows how long that takes to happen...
@_date: 2018-06-30 19:15:37
You would lose a lot of profitability converting back and forth all the time, wouldn't you? Why not just use a crypto for global transactions with no mediator?
@_date: 2017-11-04 20:13:08
Yup that's the limit.
@_date: 2017-11-04 14:08:18
I guess you're relegated to sticking your fiat under a mattress while it slowly diminishes in value then lol
@_date: 2017-11-04 14:21:40
It's all happening very quickly, mostly by automated orders. If one person sets their sell price at $7k, others might come in and sell at $6999. Then another seller might have an order at $6998.
Let's say the Bitcoin priced at $6998 sells out. People start buying at $6999 again. Once that sells off, the buying price returns to the $7k sell order. It goes up and down very rapidly.
@_date: 2017-11-04 18:13:45
Right. Sorta. About 3/4 of Bitcoin have been mined. And I was merely answering the question of how one would go about selling such a large quantity of Bitcoin. Plus, they could have been mined and traded peer-to-peer.
Not only that, it looks like the original story did not involve actual Bitcoin. It was Linden dollars from Second Life. So, it's just a hypothetical discussion, really.
@_date: 2017-11-04 17:00:07
I guess you missed the rest of my explanation.
@_date: 2017-11-04 13:52:24
It works just like the stock market. People (and bots) set buy and sell orders. If there is an order to sell at 7k and an order to buy at 7k, the transaction is completed. The going rate right now is around 7k, meaning, your one Bitcoin will sell on the market at around that price.
Traders often set limits on buying and selling to protect themselves from selling too low or buying too high. You can look on Bittrex and watch the buy and sell orders get completed in real time. It is selling, right now, at around $7000 per Bitcoin.
If one entity were to put up a thousand Bitcoin for sale at 7k, the price would drop as the "sell wall" would be consumed by other buyers. If the price were to drop to $6900, other sellers asking $6900 would sell their Bitcoin while the $7k "sell wall" would just sit there, not being purchased. The overall asking price would slowly drop as more of the large quantity of Bitcoin is sold off. As more and more Bitcoin gets purchased, the price might climb back to $7k, at which point, the sell wall would continue selling off its Bitcoin.
It's a free market - purely supply and demand (and whale manipulation heh).
Keep in mind, you can buy a tiny increment of Bitcoin. You don't have to buy one whole Bitcoin. Most people are buying 0.1 or 0.2 of a Bitcoin at a time. You can buy or sell Bitcoin up to the 8th decimal (0.00000001 BTC). So, most sales are not of hundreds or thousands of BTC. Most are very small purchases and sales.
@_date: 2017-11-04 14:24:32
Lol. There are exchanges that allow much more than 10k at a time to be sent to a bank account. And you can buy stuff directly with Bitcoin too without ever changing it to fiat. You would need to spend your billion dollars all at once? 10k a day wouldn't be enough?
Besides, this is a hypothetical situation. Who has thousands of Bitcoin sitting in a wallet? Not many people.
@_date: 2017-11-04 13:47:18
Heh. Sell on multiple exchanges every day?
@_date: 2017-11-04 14:30:15
You can buy $10 worth of Bitcoin if you want. You don't have to buy $7k in one shot. My first Bitcoin purchase was about $50 worth (about 0.02 BTC at the time heh).
@_date: 2017-11-04 13:23:29
One Bitcoin was worth less than a cent at that time (2009). On the free market today, that same single Bitcoin would trade for around $7000 usd. 
So if you simply held on to 200k worth of Bitcoin from 2009, which would be hundreds of thousands of Bitcoins, you would now own a very valuable collection of Bitcoin, which could be sold on currency exchange markets such as Coinbase, Kraken, etc. for USD cash.
@_date: 2017-11-04 18:30:17
Mm k maybe it was 10k for Interac...I don't remember. I'm hodling anyway heh.
@_date: 2017-11-04 17:36:07
You would sell it through an exchange which could then wire the cash to your bank.
@_date: 2017-11-04 14:55:26
Yeah I get it. My brother has a massive CD collection. I have a Google Play music subscription. He physically owns more music than I do. Digitally, I have access to far more music than he does.
Buying and selling digital content is becoming more normal. But there is a mental barrier that prevents some people from jumping in. This will not be the case with the next generation.
Put it this way. No kids buy CD's any more. Their music collections are entirely digital. Most money transactions are done virtually with debit and credit cards - not with cash. It's not a big stretch for money to become a strictly digital entity. Owning something that only exists in the digital world is perfectly normal to this upcoming generation.
@_date: 2017-11-04 15:50:14
Real estate is probably the best investment - but it can crash too. All investments are risks. And you need to commit a lot more money to invest in real estate. I could spend $1000 on BTC and in a year it could be worth $5000 (it could be worth $50 too). This kind of return on investment would be extremely rare in real estate, and I'd have to commit a great deal more money.
@_date: 2017-11-04 17:42:21
Very easy. Say you make an account on Coinbase. For legal reasons (mostly to prevent money-laundering), you need to verify your ID on the exchange account (you submit ID to them via your smartphone / iPhone). 
Assuming you had Bitcoin in your Coinbase wallet, you would just click "sell" from your Coinbase wallet, and it sells the bitcoin on the exchange (Coinbase uses the GDAX exchange). It then sends the USD proceeds to your bank account. Simple.
There are many exchanges. I picked Coinbase as an example because they're probably the easiest to use. They do charge a percentage on buys and sells. Some other exchanges are cheaper.
@_date: 2017-11-05 02:41:44
Just like fiat. Difference being, fiat isn't scarce. It can be produced any time a little more is needed, reducing its value. That's why fiat continuously and inevitably decreases in value while gold, for example, does not.
@_date: 2017-11-04 13:43:29
Yeah exchanges have limits on how much can be sent to a bank at a given time. But you would just sell it in increments. Quadriga CX in Canada, for example, allows up to 10k at a time, I believe?
So yes, you wouldn't be able to sell it all in one lump sum. I'd be ok with $10k a day lol.
Of course, you could just buy things directly with Bitcoin. In some countries, people are accepting bitcoin for real estate purchases, for example.
@_date: 2018-11-06 21:40:21
@_date: 2018-03-11 03:40:40
Yeah I haven't used it for a while to be honest. Didn't know there had been issues.
@_date: 2019-01-19 23:01:58
K but BitPay converts to fiat immediately... Not at the end of a given day, as far as I know, anyway. The conversion rate is locked in at the time of purchase. Correct me if I'm wrong.
It's also cheaper than what credit card companies charge merchants, with a 1% fee instead of the usual 3%. So there's that...
@_date: 2018-03-24 15:52:12
4 out of 5 used their loans to buy beer for the dorm.
@_date: 2019-01-20 07:37:28
But the merchant receives the funds immediately at the point of sale in fiat currency. BitPay essentially buys the BTC for fiat at the point of sale. So the sales price is in fiat, not crypto.
@_date: 2019-01-19 22:35:00
With some merchant solutions, like BitPay, for example, the BTC can be converted to fiat immediately, removing the volatility risk for merchants.
@_date: 2018-02-28 04:37:46
Watch a tutorial on YouTube. You want to know what you're doing before throwing your funds on an exchange.
@_date: 2018-02-28 04:27:37
I've just heard of people having difficulties with Coinsquare whereas Quadriga is a little more established and stable.

And here's a comparison video:
@_date: 2018-02-28 04:31:51
I'm no expert on it - just have heard it's a better exchange than Coinsquare.
Here check out a video about it:
@_date: 2019-01-19 22:47:19
Nevertheless, services like BitPay eliminate the volatility problem for merchants. Bitcoin is converted to fiat at the time of purchase, so the merchant doesn't even really have to deal with BTC prices at all in this case.
It's true, it is a bandaid solution. It's going to take a while before BTC is more widely accepted. But with economic problems all over the world and growing doubt in the fiat monetary system, along with events like Brexit and the Gilet Jaune movement, acceptance might arrive sooner than most would expect.
@_date: 2017-09-03 20:35:48
Yes, you do. But it's recommended you "sweep" the funds into another wallet in case, for whatever reason, the ATM is compromised (say a camera or other scanner is spying on your transaction).
@_date: 2018-07-03 16:43:42
True, but the printing of said cash cost energy in the first place. It doesn't matter when the energy cost takes place, whether at time of transaction or at time of printing.
@_date: 2018-07-03 16:39:14
Energy consumption for Bitcoin hash rates is a feature, not an oversight. It is intentionally designed to consume energy and to encourage ongoing upgrading to ensure security.
But I'll return to my main point. Both forms of money generation cost energy. It's not a binary situation where one is wasteful and one isn't. They both generate waste and consume energy. Criticisms of PoW mining tend to over-simplify this problem by comparing energy consumption for mining to a small country's annual energy consumption, for example. 
Interesting discussion, though. Thanks for your thoughts.
@_date: 2018-07-09 15:16:42
This is just China propping up its own image. They want to appear to be effective with their policies. There is no way that the volume is that low in China. It's simply not being traded "out in the open". Look at the biggest former Chinese exchanges like Huobi and Okex -- they have huge volume. What does that tell you?
@_date: 2018-07-03 16:14:05
It's also worth noting that those statistics are strictly for US printed dollar production, never mind the rest of the world. We're talking massive waste here.
@_date: 2018-07-04 04:29:37
You're not really "sending" the Bitcoin anywhere. It's not "in" a wallet in the first place. 
Think of it like a number on a network - it's a public number anyone can see - and it is matched with a secret number only the owner has. The number on the network... is on the network. It's not "in" a thing at all.
What is in a wallet? The owner's keys to the number - the private keys.
So you're not really moving the Bitcoin from one wallet to another. You're just changing who has the secret keys.
So if your Bitcoin is "in" an exchange wallet, the exchange can see the keys. The exchange has the private keys, so they basically own your Bitcoin unless you store your keys in another wallet.
Don't keep private keys on an exchange.
@_date: 2018-07-07 02:34:47
I suspect developers at Monero, Digibyte, Ravencoin, and a bunch of other projects might disagree with you. I doubt they're all morons.
@_date: 2018-07-06 21:45:26
What you're referring to is called proof of stake. You stake a given amount of a coin to provide consensus. The greater amount and age of coins staked, the higher probability you have of being awarded.
This prevents attacks since the attacker would have to own most of a network in order to attack it. Problem being, it's a bit of a rich-get-richer scheme whereas PoW models allow anyone to earn rewards regardless of previous wealth.
Ethereum developers are contemplating moving to a proof of stake model but it has its drawbacks, so it's a bit controversial. 
It's an interesting topic. I will be doing a series of articles about consensus solutions in the future.

I wrote this article a while back about collapsing economies like Venezuela, where the people are turning to crypto as a way to survive.
It's based on reading I've done here and there, but of course, I'm not "on the frontlines", like you. What are your thoughts regarding this trend?
@_date: 2018-02-28 04:15:40
Quadriga CX is generally considered the better option.
@_date: 2018-07-02 14:17:52
Money is a means of trade. That's pretty much what the whole article is about.
@_date: 2018-07-03 16:10:16
Fair point. But not all fiat money is digital. Consider the statistics provided regarding the production of printed money. It's a substantial quantity of waste.
@_date: 2018-07-31 15:24:23
Yeah the article mentions the most likely scenario is a delay by the SEC, which is still positive, in my opinion. My guess is we see approval next year some time.

In Canada, all of the major banks do not permit debit card purchases of cryptocurrency.

We'll leave that job to the accredited investors.
@_date: 2018-07-03 16:26:40
Hmmm I see what you're saying, but you're confusing some issues, in my opinion. The USA, for example, prints cash. It is not a third world country. It's true that most of it is digitally tracked and traded, so I concede that point.
Any cash that is printed costs energy. If I instead transacted with technological gear (assuming I'm not using a paper wallet, for example), I would also be consuming energy. Both have energy costs.
I'm not saying that cryptocurrency does not have energy costs. I'm saying all forms of money have energy costs, but cryptocurrency has been in the spotlight for consuming large amounts of energy. When you examine both sides, I think you could reasonably concede that both forms of money consume considerable energy.
@_date: 2018-07-03 16:32:27
Paper cash only lasts a few years on average.

You stated North America, so I'm assuming you're Canadian. Americans don't refer to themselves as living in North America heh. If you're in Canada, Coinsquare works with e-mail transfers very easily.
Coinbase is a bit problematic for Canadians with banks since you can't cash back out to a Canadian bank with the American-based Coinbase.
You could also try Quadriga CX which has lower fees than Coinsquare, but isn't quite as user-friendly and doesn't support e-mail transfers (at least the last time I checked it didn't).
I think the minimum e-mail transfer is $100 though, so that's something to consider.

Fiat isn't backed by anything any more.
@_date: 2018-04-22 20:52:10
It's not "backed" by anything. It's created out of debt and does not follow any standard. It used to be backed by gold, but that's not the case any more.
@_date: 2018-04-22 16:56:52
Not necessarily. Paper wallets could act as cash, passed from one person to another just as easily as cash.
Also, Bitcoin could be expressed in satoshis and in the future could be divided into units that are fractions of satoshis.
Power consumption could be overcome via many different solutions such as hybrid PoW/PoS or even simply by the likelihood that most people in the future will have sources of renewable energy such as solar or geothermal power directly feeding their own households.
Scaling will continue to improve through innovations such as second layer solutions like SegWit and the Lightning Network.

I think it is possible that in our lifetimes a currency like Bitcoin, maybe not Bitcoin itself, maybe a bunch of cryptocurrencies, could replace fiat, especially in countries that have experienced hyperinflation. It will spread globally from those countries and gain more acceptance over time.
@_date: 2018-04-22 19:50:48
I'd say the opposite is true. You don't need to trust cryptocurrency because it's mathematical. An open-source decentralised currency requires no trust whatsoever.
@_date: 2018-04-22 18:27:30
It could fade to zero, you're right. I don't think it will though, simply because it is such a far superior monetary solution compared to fiat and can not be manipulated by a central entity in the same way.
Fiat is created out of debt via bonds. It is then fractionally reserved to circulate through the economy, fabricating artificial value more than ten times the originally created value - which was manufactured from debt, remember. Then, to pay back the debt, more fiat is created out of, you guessed it; debt. It is mathematically impossible for fiat to increase in value in the long term and will always result in further inflation, thus driving its value toward zero.
To curb this inflation, some nations spend enormous quantities of money on things like missiles which, once detonated, literally destroy the money that was used to pay for them, thus taking the money out of circulation. Other nations simply have their fiat spiral out of control into hyperinflation, economically devastating the majority of the population, requiring a bail-out from the IMF who are only to happy to indebt the population and "take care" of its resources in exchange for the favour. Digital currency has no need for this destructive debt - destruction - more debt cycle.
@_date: 2018-04-22 18:35:59
Digital currency doesn't require issuance of debt because it is not generated by a central authority (well, it can be, but decentralised currencies aren't). Watch this video about how fiat is created . It's very interesting. 
@_date: 2018-04-22 19:24:02

Bitcoin IS cash in a cashless society, except it's better because it isn't printed out of thin air and isn't controlled by a central entity.
@_date: 2018-04-22 17:25:17
For sure, second layer solutions are absolutely in their infancy. So is the entire market and its technology. It's true that paper wallets would need some sort of verification but I'm sure that's not an impossibility. Keep in mind, there's nothing stopping Bitcoin itself from increasing block size as another scaling solution, if necessary.
In due time, fiat will fade to a value of zero and we will be using digital cryptocurrency on a regular basis.
@_date: 2018-04-22 18:48:46
There are some interesting solutions to this such as SALT and ETHLend, which lend value from the currency holders to borrowers. This is decentralised lending and is entirely possible without fiat and without fractional reserve lending.
Again, this technology is in its infancy, but the fact that it is built not on fraud, but on consensus and inherent scarcity gives it considerably better credence than the fiat system.
@_date: 2018-04-22 19:31:21
The free market. If a currency has value via the consensus of buyers and sellers, it survives. If it doesn't, it fails.
@_date: 2018-04-22 19:40:13
You just described fiat.
I don't think it will be a single currency solution. I think there will be many interchangeable currencies, similar to stocks but with the ease of trading and storing value that does not exist in the traditional stock market.
