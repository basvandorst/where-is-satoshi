The mortal enemy of Bitcoin isn't actually governments or banks. It's just moms.

Why just January 1st?

Is your mom literally my mom this morning?

Why compound daily?

**Is no one talking about the obvious manipulation?**
In gdax at least, these 200btc sell walls that go up to push the price down, then disappear. The only reason for these price drops is the artificial 200btc sell walls pushing the price down, then the market responding back up when they go away for a while.
Doesn't really seem anything to do with the technology, or backlog, etc. It's as simple as this manipulation. Right?

I'm not sure about trading themselves but it seems like their purpose is to keep bitcoin low, for some reason. Or they're playing the market in these $100 increment drops to profit.

That's the question I guess. One thing I could guess they're doing is that they've already invested in bch (bitcoin cash) so they're trying to drive people over there. Now that the bch price is high they can either drop out of bch back to btc at a low btc price, or try to actually make bch official, as bch proponents have been trying to do. 
Or they're just playing btc well enough since they control the drops now, and are profiting off the btc exchanges alone. Honestly $1 mil is a small amount to some groups so I'm not sure to what end they'll keep this up.

They don't sell the batch. They just keep it up long enough for sellers above them to drop their prices (because sellers won't wait for 200 coins to sell. plus when just one person drops below the 200 wall everyone else has to follow suit -&gt; chain reaction). They pull the order right out before actually selling much. It's been continuous, every few minutes.
It's such easy manipulation with only about $1.2million in bitcoin
