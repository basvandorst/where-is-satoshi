Truth be told, having seen/read too many mixed opinions, I just decided to take what comes after as an expensive learning experience. Of course, I've done enough research to decrease the chance of ending up with a provider that is a flight risk. Forget about which provider it is, let's just look at the progress and numbers.
Getting started -
Mining contract opened on Aug 12. BTC at the time was about 3870 USD.
Contracted at 10 TH/s, costing 2200 USD. It would have been equivalent to buying 0.56847545 BTC.
After over a week -
Based on current BTC price, these 10 days have given back about 111 USD or about 5% of the contract price.
Average BTC income after fees is 0.0024
Have tried withdrawing after 2 days of the contract starting. It worked fine, though it did make me a bit anxious as it took over an hour to reflect in my wallet. Have not withdrawn anything since. The transfer fee wasn't negligible (to me) so I'm going to keep transfers to a minimum until there's a good chunk to do so.
If BTC prices remains at current level or rises -
At 11.1 USD per day (based on current 10 day average), in theory, it will take 198 days to break even on cost.
However, this doesn't consider any increase in difficulty, which will reduce total daily income after fees.
At the same time -
Based on the current average income after fees, it'll take 237 days to accumulate the same amount of BTC had I bought it at the time of opening a contract instead.
There is no question that buying BTC is more profitable, so the above is just to give it some perspective.
On day 238, I should have more BTC (by number not by value) than if I bought directly with fiat currency.
So, if I only wanted to 2200 USD for the purpose of acquiring BTC, then *provided* the hash power on contract continues to be sufficient for the first 237 days (about 8 months), I can continue to acquire very small increments of BTC beyond what I would have purchased originally. 
This is also on the assumption that I only HODL the initial amount of BTC and not take profits along the way.
Let's see how it goes. As long as the contract manages to exceed 0.56847545 BTC before the hashing power can no longer keep up with difficulty, then I'd be happy.
