That or having what's known in financial world as market-maker would help. An entity that would be willing to convert USD to bitcoins and vice versa 24/7. It doesn't need to be the best liquidity pricewise, just needs to be reasonable for people to assume that they won't have a problem converting.

* That single $150 mil transaction impacted the stats for that day

How is that? In 2008 a few major banks went bust - Washington Mutual, IndyMac, NetBank, etc., [FDIC stepped up](

Um, details?
What's more likely to had happened is on the news of BTC hitting $1,000 they probably have a bunch of retirees (who else would ask their bank for advice?) inquiring if they can "invest" into bitcoins. 
While I'm bullish on BTC, it's probably not a good candidate for low-risk portfolio, and if you're into high-risk, you are unlikely to reach out to Rabobank to ask for their advice on anything.

As long as there's a liquid enough exchange and possibility of exiting Yuan into bitcoin, and exiting bitcoin into dollar within a matter of a few seconds, you don't really need intrinsic value - liquidity is already a value.
Same argument could be applied to gold - its intrinsic value is ability to be used in HDMI cables and some other materials that benefit from conducting properties, yet people who own gold are mainly interested in liquidity provided.

Please elaborate. They've made it pretty difficult to transact in pieces of gold, and general public didn't seem to mind.

What do you think about potential of liquidity attack? Like the way they mandate US dollar is a legal tender, they would go after places accepting bitcoins, which would make casual user less likely to go through the hassle of owning them.

I think a lot of people understand what a centralized ledger (kept by a trusted third-party) is, but distributed ledger and trust verification is novel.

What /user/montseayo is saying is that after reading Krugman's argument a rational person would want to diversify their cash position into Bitcoin to avoid what you're describing.
