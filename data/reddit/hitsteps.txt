Your coin apparently have not moved at all. You can check it in blockchain: 
Most probably it is due to bitcoin core client not being sync.
Are you able to use electrum wallet on your wallet private key? 
Electrum does not need to be synced.

If you bitcoin wallet gave BIP39 compliant seeds, or it can give you private keys, you can import bitcoin privatekey/seed in other altcoins wallets and claim your forked coins. be sure to don't import your seeds or private keys into untrusted wallets. It is good idea to create a new bitcoin wallet and transfer your bitcoin coins to new bitcoin wallet first. so that if altcoin wallet tried to steal your original bitcoins, they not be able to.

Nope, it will reach regardless. if network get fix, it will be used as a currency. otherwise it will still hold value as gold substance.

You'll need to create a new electrum wallet (with new seeds and private keys) so that it become safe again

Fork already happened. You need a wallet that can show btd. But be very very very careful because you need to use your current wallet private key to a btd supported wallet. And if that wallet have malicious codes, it can steal your original btc amounts, since both of them share same private key (this method of stealing already happened with btg)
One way to be safe is to create a new btc wallet. Transfer your btc to new wallet. Then use your old wallet private key on btd wallets, so if they ever want to steal your btc, they'll see they are already transfered elsewhere.
You can see list of btd wallets in

Bitcoin is all around the world now, everybody talk about it. It is normal for exchanges to crash due to this much of exposure and unexpected high traffic from new buyers.
