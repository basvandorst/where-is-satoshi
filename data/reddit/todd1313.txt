Stop ambulance chasing.. Sorry you need to resort to Reddit to drum up customers.. If you try to sue them for a few people and something happens to Bitfinex then you are hurting way more people then you are representing..

Are you willing to back this statement with your own money? I can send you my wallet address

Thats a deal since you say they are worthless.. Better take advantage of it now.. Offer is on the table

I used Piiko dot com and recharged my cell phone.. Took about 30-40 seconds for the transaction to show on the block chain and they credited the account immediately.. No confirmations needed.. 
@_date: 2016-08-15 00:34:00
Hows this sound I will send you a screen shot of the email from their email address and then you can make a public apology to me on this post.. You make a pretty bold statement to not be able to back up a single word of it.. I will be more then glad to email screen shots of the email FROM the Bitfinex support email. Take your tin foil hat somewhere else.

I love how some people are down voting the thread when its only an email of what I received. Not a single personal opinion from me. What is so bad about sharing it that it needs a down vote? Please tell me if you are one of the people that have down voted. I am curious..

How are they tying up liquid assets? They arent the ones lending someone money to trade with.. That is done from margin funding from the clients like you or me with money on the platform.. They are not offering leverage on BFX Tokens
@_date: 2016-08-14 17:21:30
Yes if you want you can open up an account and buy away.. Thats your decision.
@_date: 2016-08-20 15:32:19
I love how people on Redditt who got their law degree from Youtube University try to make their words sound all legal.. Umm No Your grammar is terrible..  
@_date: 2016-08-14 17:11:55
Under the circumstances I give the a 7.5 out of 10.. Could I have done it better Maybe, Maybe not.. Is there room for improvement Yes.. Could they have done worse: Oh yea they could have thrown their hands up and said sue me.. They didnt quite so in my eyes that gained a few points.. I give them credit for not quitting and most people bashing them have no clue what it is like to run a business.. They are just sour they lost money and are blinded with anger.. I cant blame them I guess but owing several businesses I tend to read between the lines.. 
@_date: 2016-08-12 21:31:28
They sent the withdraw to the bank account where the deposit to them came from. It clearly states that..

Im talking about the company as a whole.. To be insolvent is unable to pay debts owed.. We get that but you act like BTC is the only crypto.. How do you know they didnt have 100 million worth of lets say ETH

We have no clue. I wish we did but we are not privileged to this information yet

I agree prioritizing is not the best way to gain trust or the way to go about it but unfortunately this is the business world we live in. I could very easily be on the other end of things so I try to look at everything from both sides.. 
@_date: 2016-08-16 02:01:21
Atta boy Matty  Get that trash out of here.. 
@_date: 2016-08-17 01:59:18
That has nothing to do with your statement.. If you are that dumb to sue over $500 and lose more money thats on you.. Sounds like you are pretty desperate but to each his own.. I just think you sound like a complete tool blaming the victim saying they deserve it and are lazy for not doing something. It obviously doent make sense from a business stand point. That statement obviously shows your lack of intellect and proves you are nobody and will always be a nobody in life.. I love coming across people like you in the business world.. I eat people like you alive and can sit here and just write off a huge loss knowing I will make it back this month while you cry like a little baby over $500.. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 20:39:10
If we had an open lending USD on margin funding at the time of the shut down (not the hack time) and it was still showing on the account would that say the money is safe and in control of bitfinex? I was literally on BFX when I got an email and seconds later it was down.. The money balance was still showing at that point..
@_date: 2016-08-14 23:12:23
I have a feeling they will have an official statement coming out.. I dont see why not. The dust just has to settle
@_date: 2016-08-15 01:43:15
Of course but at least it gives us some type of information to make our decisions on.. Better then going in blind
@_date: 2016-08-05 00:50:13
No exchange up today EST like stated..No formal announcement like stated afternoon EST. This would make the 2nd time something from BFX was said and not delivered.. 2 days in a row now.. Doesnt look good.. They could have at least posted  formal update instead of being silent RIP Bitfinex
@_date: 2016-08-12 22:14:41
Damn you are getting down voted like crazy 
@_date: 2016-08-14 22:29:17
I hope so.. Its the right thing to do and I dont want anyone to lose money. Even if it isnt mine I still dont want to see people lose it to theft.. 
@_date: 2016-08-17 14:20:41
About 30 mins to an hour
@_date: 2016-08-16 02:07:34
Well at least its not oodles and noodles.. Guess they didnt get all the ETH 
@_date: 2016-08-16 01:19:59
You are just clueless arent you? What about LTC ETC ETH USD Tether etc?  So your saying they didnt have a single one of them? You have no clue what you are even talking about.. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 17:53:15
OK Its just hard to sit here.. I havent eaten anything in 24 hours now.. I have just sat here quietly and havent even commented.. I do appreciate you answering questions and being as transparent as possible but something is better then nothing even if it isnt much..
@_date: 2016-08-23 20:40:58
Pretty shallow of you to blame someone you obviously dont have a clue about.. The market is within $10 of where it was during the crash so it has rebounded.. 
@_date: 2016-08-16 21:13:47
I love how everyone says they are so stupid Blah Blah Blah.. They just made off with your 60 mil and are still operating.. I think that they sure outsmarted you
@_date: 2016-08-16 01:56:31
There you are buddy. I was starting to miss my Matty boy.. I just just hoping you didnt go off and kill yourself since your radio silence for a few hours.. Glad to see you are still alive
@_date: 2016-08-14 17:13:43
I get a response usually within an hour.. You see how they apologized to me for taking about 3 hours.. I guess they look at my account and see my history with them and assume they want to keep me as a client
@_date: 2016-08-15 03:41:01
I was just sharing an email that support sent me.. Thats all
@_date: 2016-08-12 23:43:14
Open an account with another email and dont register it.. Transfer what you want to trade with over.. 
@_date: 2016-08-15 21:41:17
Just an FYI Im not from Bifinex.. This is just an email I got from support and I was sharing to keep the community informed since they dont.. 
@_date: 2016-08-14 17:17:47
Well everyone I really didnt post this for a bashing session.. I was just trying to fill the void of lack of information we all seek. I know its not much but I was feeling some users might want to read what they had to say.. I am just trying to contribute to the community in a neutral position so everyone can make their own decisions on the intel gathered

Thanks for your 2 cents.. After your haircut I now give you back .0128 cents. Thank you for your anticipated cooperation

Go to Bitfinex and buy a lot of BFX Coins
@_date: 2016-08-14 18:07:30
Yea I seen that.. I bought some and it went up around 36% and now I pretty much broke even on my loss.. This is the world of a trader.. Most are just blinded by the number and see a loss.. Where others lose I see opportunity.
@_date: 2016-08-16 02:06:25
Shit I might even throw you an upvote for that 
@_date: 2016-08-14 15:38:09
Apologies for the length of our reply , I started writing this as a reply to your specific concerns but then realised that this may be something that a number of users may be interested in hearing and so have expanded it a bit but at the same time have hopefully addressed your points, please see the below:-
Thanks for your message and your continued support
The attack on the 2nd August was devastating both financially and emotionally.
The BitFinex team are all strong supporters of the Bitcoin Ecosystem and are passionate about being able to provide the most innovative products, technology, security and customer support.
There was an obvious failing with our security system to enable a hack to happen in the first place and then an additional failing with regards to the amount stolen. We cannot give out any further information at this stage as there are ongoing investigations with 3rd party forensic investigators and also multiple law enforcement agencies.
In the 8 days whilst the platform was offline we rebuilt our servers, moved the location and ran a number of security checks in conjunction with the forensic investigators before being satisfied that it would be safe to resume the BitFinex platform. Even though we have no evidence or reason to believe that any of users’ personal information was stolen we also requested that all users change passwords and security settings. All withdrawals are being manually approved and we have switched back to a hot and cold wallet system which means that if there was another hack then BitFinex has sufficient funds to cover any loss from the hot wallet.
With regards to the aftermath of the hack then the “easy” thing to do would have been to figuratively hand the keys over to a big 4 accounting firm and leave them to sort things out. I am happy to say that this thought did not cross the mind of anyone at BitFinex and we collectively took on the responsibility to make good on users’ losses.
The decision to socialize losses across all users and all currencies was made after consulting legal advice as this would be the closest approximation of what would have happened had we filed for bankruptcy. This resulted in everyone taking a loss or haircut, but it is our intention to repay these losses and so we issued the BFX token with a face value of $1USD. The goal is for BitFinex to redeem each of those tokens at $1USD per piece at some stage in the future. We have made this token tradeable for users who do not believe that we will be able to do this to sell them and further recoup some of their losses, and for investors who do believe that we will be able to repay at face value to buy these at a lower rate (currently around $0.36) and receive the $1USD if/when the tokens are redeemed.
In order to redeem these tokens at $1USD we are exploring a few options – (1) the recovery of the stolen coins themselves (2) Outside investment in BitFinex for at least the amount of the funds lost and (3) operating a normal profitable trading platform with periodic reduction of the tokens. Options (1) and (2) would mean a relatively quick repayment of the BFX tokens, option (3) would take considerably longer.
With regards to our current solvency; BitFinex has committed considerable resources in to the “pool” that took the haircut to reduce the amount that our users would lose but at the same time we have retained an operating float to cover the next few month’s costs and expenses and also for legal costs if there are any legal claims against BitFinex (or iFinex that owns and operates the BitFinex platform). The first two days after the site resumption saw considerable funds leaving the platform, both in Crypto-currencies and USD but we are happy to say that funds have also recently started to come back in to the exchange. We have recently resumed margin funding and margin trading activities (for non-US based users) and are seeing good numbers on the site, the price of btc is relatively stable and we are again the largest USD exchange based on daily trading. We are currently working on enabling our US based users to have full functionality again and when this happens we expect our numbers to go even higher.
We are hoping that our efforts and commitment to repaying our users will keep any legal action against BitFinex to a minimum and also that anybody contemplating legal action will see that the outcome may well be that they would actually receive a lot less than we are offering due to the high costs of legal fees and that there would also be a considerable delay in receiving funds.
We firmly believe that so far BitFinex has made the best possible decisions and demonstrated considerable resilience and resourcefulness in getting to this position but we are not resting on any laurels or thinking that this is “job done”. It remains our goal to repay all users losses as quickly and as painlessly as possible. We will continue to press forward with these plans and communicate as effectively as possible
Ultimately it is your decision as to whether or not to continue to trade with BitFinex and trust us with your funds but we do hope that our recent actions will help to convince you of our sincerity and abilities here.
Kind regards,
Bitfinex Support Team

I am rooting for them for the simple fact I want to see everyone get their money back.. Its the only right thing to do.. Lately I have been on every platform under the sun looking for my fix but none seem to have the same action I am use to.. I am going through crypto depression..  I need some high action trading I am use to..
@_date: 2016-08-13 00:21:44
LOL I can tell you what they will say: Thank you for submitting your request. We have received your request and are working on responding to you as soon as possible. If you have any additional information to add to this case, please reply to this email.
In the meantime, feel free to browse the Coinbase Community forum ( and visit our Support Center (
@_date: 2016-08-14 04:13:20
Dude.. I dont think you're an asshole.. I hope you do get it resolved and get your money.. Its the right thing.. I feel your pain.. I could have bought a nice new car but instead my money was stolen.. I hope everyone is made whole including you.. Im just saying hang in there and dont give up hope.. 
@_date: 2016-08-07 19:48:52
They have been saying today today today for a week.. What makes you think this is any different? 
@_date: 2016-08-16 01:05:48
I really dont think you will get any sympathy here.. Sorry for your loss though
@_date: 2016-08-13 00:24:10
I havent bought any but I am holding a significant amount of them. Of course it is a step in the right direction. If they can start generating profits they can start paying people back. 
@_date: 2016-08-16 23:46:13
My point is would it really be worth it for someone who lost $1000. You think someone deserves losing money because it is not worth a law suit for $1000? How is that being lazy? Im not going to sue and I lost way way way more then that.. Its not because I am lazy.. Time is money to me. I will make way more money in the time I spend doing this then I have lost.. Not that I am lazy I work 60 plus hours a week running my businesses.. 
@_date: 2016-08-12 23:44:05
Still a step in the positive direction.. I am very upset at losing money but if they can resume operations there is a better chance of getting paid back
@_date: 2016-08-06 03:39:13
12 mins and "today" is over BFX is a failure.. 
@_date: 2016-08-13 00:28:41
LOL Awe did I hurt your feelings so bad you want to go run and snitch to reddit.. Hahaha 
@_date: 2016-08-06 16:00:49
So BFX hasnt put up a penny of their money @_date: 2016-08-05 20:57:34
Are you going to make a formal announcement soon?  How many days has it been sine the last?
@_date: 2016-08-06 15:48:06
When did they change the spokes person? If you are referring to the post below and Stephen he is one of the customer service reps 
@_date: 2016-08-04 20:09:52
Why cant you give us the details now.. This statement and many others are leading to you are already working on it so therefore you must have a plan if you are working on it
@_date: 2016-08-14 19:47:40
No Problem. I am truly sorry you cant access your funds.. I do not wish this upon anyone.. I hope you regain what is yours and are made whole.. I wish you the Best of luck sir.. 
@_date: 2016-08-14 21:49:56
Dats grate 
@_date: 2016-08-05 01:19:33
So where is the announcement you said would be today EST?
@_date: 2016-08-14 03:02:28
Considering they had the 2nd highest trading volume today why not? As of now Poloniex has done around $15.5 million and Bitfinex did $6.1 million and 3rd was BTCE at $3.5 million.. They still do more trading then any other exchange except one after all this.. That should tell you something.. I moved money in and out today with no issue what so ever.. 
@_date: 2016-08-14 17:22:59
We are all entitled to our opinion.. I am just trying to stay somewhat positive in a bad situation. I hope each and every one of us is made whole and paid back out money in full.. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 14:46:37
I had a lot of money in margin funding. After I evaluate my loss will I be able to obtain records without a court order of who the funds where made available to for the money lost and all the transaction tied to my account for independent study? It would simply be unfair/illegal to say your money is gone and was lost by someone and not tell them who to go after legally to reclaim the debt. I own one of the largest debt collection companies in the US so the resources are at my disposal and I would like to use them. I am well within my boundaries to exercise my legal rights.
@_date: 2016-08-10 01:19:57

What I dont understand is I am a private investigator with a lot of tools in my tool box and everything I run on their website Names addresses phone numbers Domain etc nothing seems to come back as legit.. Why do they have to hide if they are a reputable law firm? You would think something would come back and all of a sudden all this information just pops up out of thin air?
@_date: 2016-08-15 23:34:34
No Clue I have been accused of everything under the sun including working for Bitfinex.. Where is my paycheck and how much is it? Im not cheap 
@_date: 2016-08-14 17:24:30
OK Explain why I was able to with draw today and yesterday since I am an idiot. Please spread your wisdom bitcoin God.. 
@_date: 2016-08-06 01:23:11
I did the exact same thing
@_date: 2016-08-03 17:33:12
    Why havent you released a statement yet. We are going on 24 hours now and I am sure the community wants to be informed.. You have to know something by now.. At least release what you do know even if its hardly anything at least its a formal statement.. You said during the day today UTC time and its now 17:30UTC When can we expect to hear this?
@_date: 2016-08-19 15:20:43
That website is so shady its not even funny. I wouldnt give them even my email. 
@_date: 2016-08-14 04:00:13
You do realize that the BFX is not a recognized Crypto it is a token and not even included in those figures..Why dont you look before you open up your mouth..  Trust me the rush to with draw is over.. Everyone that was going to bail already did it.. If they havent it is because they cant and that means the cant trade either so thats not included in the figures.. If you think people said oh I will am going to with draw everything but I guess I will wait a few days before I do it you are foolish.. Right now on the order books is roughly 5.3 million in buy orders and  and 4 million in sell orders and that is only BTC No other crypto..  Why dont you go look for yourself.. Its all right in front of you
@_date: 2016-08-13 16:12:31
I hate to be that guy but relax.. I lost a car in all this.. All my functions are restored. What is left I can with draw but that still doesnt change the fact I lost a car.. I am SLOWLY watching more and more function come back to my account.. I own several businesses myself and can only imagine the hell they are going through.. You can be mad but you have to give them credit at the same time. At least they didnt throw their hands up and say F it just sue us..That could take years if you have any positive outcome from that They where once the greatest platform and they are trying to regain that.. I will admit I was pretty worried at first but every day that passes and more function thats restored shows they are fighting to get back.. I dont think they are intentionally singling out anyone.. Think about this. I have opened bank accounts in multiple countries outside of the motherland and each one took paperwork after paperwork to no end and took anywhere from a few weeks to months to accomplish.. I am sorry for your trouble. I am in the same boat as you with the loss but hopefully they will open up function to you.. I dont think its some witch hunt if that makes you feel any better..   
@_date: 2016-08-12 21:26:56
You are just some idiot with an internet connection.. If you where going to do anything except bark you would have consulted a lawyer and the first thing they would have offered you legal advise wise is to shut your damn mouth.. I am offering you this advice for free.. SHUT UP MORON

@_date: 2016-08-14 15:26:35
If I was in control of that much BTC and I just got hacked I sure wouldnt keep using the same hot wallet.. I would keep a rotation or make new ones.. I moved money in and out yesterday with no problem..

If or when BFX starts to allow withdraws will people holding USD be able to buy crypto and move it out or will it have to be done through tradition FIAT Transactions? I ask because I need to prepare paperwork as soon as possible if it is only going to be FIAT

Your system is terrible.. I tried forever to get my account right.. You couldnt verify my address.. I find that Ironic because I have owned the house for years. Have many utilities in my name. I am also a Private Investigator so I know what shows up in all the systems and credit reports etc.. My address is clearly my credit header. To be honest after all the crap you guys put me through I just gave up.. I was totally frustrated and I am not wasting another second sending more of my details for you only to hear you need something else.. You must lose a ton of business this was because I took my business elsewhere and so did my father.

The fee they set up is automatic and way way way to low.. You would think since the halving they would update it.. I mean seriously what is a few pennies more these days to let them pick it up on the blocks.. Case is a joke
@_date: 2017-03-14 00:22:30
Its my friends so I dont know the exact one but after talking to support the first time in December they said he cant choose the fee. It is automatic and they would make the correct updates and never did.. They are worthless at their support

Everyone that has the internet
@_date: 2017-01-07 05:59:35
I feel you man.. Coinbase is going to hold your Bitcoin hostage till the payment you made to them clears and they have your money.. Most likely even longer now that the market is crashing.. They want to buy it at a low and sell it to you for the price you agreed to at the high.. They dont even have your BTC yet most likely.. They arent going to hold a significant amount and be exposed.. They will buy some everyday at market price when they have to give it to you.  Nothing you can do about it.  Sorry you got sucked into the market violence.. 
@_date: 2017-01-07 06:04:05
Time to watch the bull run short.. 
@_date: 2017-01-07 06:09:38
The bubble popped.. To many people got caught up in the run and leveraged them self way to far.. Then the smart traders stepped in and took profits and took up short positions. That force liquidated all the little guys using margin funding and triggered all the whales stop loss orders.

Bunch of thieves. I would bet they dont credit users and screw over the community like they do time after time. Then they will sell it all on the low and keep the money. I bet they have a ton of it from all the BTC they keep in cold storage. Give everyone what is theirs polo you thieving bastards. 
@_date: 2016-11-18 21:54:56
He is weak..

Here you go. I have to get the other wallet addresses from the Alts on my work computer.. This is only for BTC 
@_date: 2017-04-17 18:53:48
The tokens where settled in USDT to accounts but its not like you couldnt buy some BTC with it. 
@_date: 2017-04-22 15:02:30
OMG Thanks I am sitting here reading this, drinking my coffee, taking profits all while getting a great laugh at your expense and you havent been able to buy a bitcoin in 3 weeks. Imagine the profits you missed in the last 3 weeks.  The gloves are off bahahhahahaa   Reddit tough guy. The ironic part of all this is I am actually the type guy that would help you if you acted properly and made a post wanting some help and asked nicely. It wouldnt be a big deal to pick up the phone. Even have you call and chat with me so I could make suggestions to get you started or have you login to Local Bitcoins. See my rating of 100% and run over to the bank and make a deposit. Not like I cant spare 100 BTC or anything. 
@_date: 2017-04-21 22:48:18
I have been a Bitfinex Client for many years. In the wake of all the news I sent Kraken a message explaining who I am and my situation and asked for a manager to get in contact with me. I needed to discuss bringing my business over to them. One of the higher ups called me within 24 hours and he was very attentive and provided me with everything I needed to do. He was very efficient and a pleasure to deal with. He gave me his cell number and has responded to every single email within an hour. Sometimes within minutes. It seems like the way you are acting on reddit is probably the way you are acting with them. I dont blame them for not wanting to do business with you.  
@_date: 2017-04-17 18:59:43
They have been keeping us informed with multiple announcements. I have been expecting this for a week now. No surprise here

@_date: 2017-04-17 18:55:46

How am I blaming anyone? By saying please get it straight?
@_date: 2017-04-25 22:46:08
No problem. I will post the others when I get access to them for you
@_date: 2017-04-25 22:58:07
After the rough week the community had what is wrong with a little parody to have a laugh?  You should probably see a doctor for the stick stuck up your ass. I find it ironic that you had to go do your research on me. Looks like you are really concerned with me.. Goes to show after your post how fucking nosey your are with everyones business instead of worrying about yourself. 
@_date: 2017-04-18 04:36:41
You post here. Then people question you and you fly off your rocker calling them names and cussing.. How is anyone able to take you seriously acting like a child.. Post the emails from support showing they lied. Post your proof. I am sure for questioning you I will now be called names and cussed at so go ahead. You will not hurt my feelings.

Looks like we have another Reddit tough guy... Oh please.. Dont take the reddit gloves off.. Im already getting scared 
@_date: 2017-04-17 21:42:02
I just hope you guys hurry up with it all. I think just proving solvency will put people at ease and the rest can be worked out from there with banking or whatever. We are coming up on a year now that clients have been asking for this. I think it has been enough time to have an reputable independent company add up what you have in your possession and say hey everyone these people have all the money they claim to have.  I have been with Bifinex since BTC was less then $200. I have stuck it out through all of this and supported you and continued to trade.  I am just getting sick of having to worry and all the drama associated with this.. It seems like it is just one thing after another. I dont want to focus on worrying and drama. I want to focus on my crypto trading and investing.  Eventually people will say enough is enough and just stop doing business with Finex.  
@_date: 2017-04-25 17:57:52
Why dont you just go look at their cold storage address and see how many BTC they have. I know this wont prove that they are solvent but it will at least show you they are in control of a certain amount of BTC. Obviously if that gets to low then their is a problem but for now they have plenty left. You can actually see people are depositing again and it is slowly going back up
@_date: 2017-04-23 00:09:51
OK Go buy one then and put your BTC on it

You should get some help for taking life so serious. Have a laugh for once because if you believe this is a serious post you are the one with issues. 
@_date: 2017-04-22 14:45:42
Because it now has a design flaw. It is unable to update the blockchain fee. It is confirmed that their mining fee is old and they refuse to update it and transactions are not being picked up with such a low fee rendering it trash. It is now unusable and will not be useable in the future therefor it is now trash. Time to upgrade from old technology and trash the old technology. The same as an Iphone 3g is now trash since it it rendered useless. Let me start the slow clap for you making your self look like a fool even more. Welcome to Crypto. You really need to educate yourself. It is trash now. 
@_date: 2017-04-28 23:10:59
LOL Good one Brandon.. 
@_date: 2017-04-20 05:15:10
Do you realize what this will do to BTC if Bitfinex would shut down? You spreading this fear mongering can really set back BTC if Bitfinex loses its customers and gets shut down. 
@_date: 2017-04-19 03:16:12

Its not just Bitfinex that is a target. OK Coin has the same issues.. Just take proper precautions to protect yourself. You shouldnt keep excess funds on the exchange anyway. Only what you need to trade with
@_date: 2017-04-17 20:07:18
I think they made a mistake with the legal action. Now banks wont want to do business with them in fear of dealing with negative outcomes.  Possibility of legal action and bad press being associated

@_date: 2017-04-21 22:57:36
Did it cross your mind that maybe you should be looking to build a better relationship in the Bitcoin community then posting your immature fud on Reddit? Act like an adult and the community will accept you. Obviously you are new by your statement "try to open my first bitcoin account" and this is not how business is done. 
@_date: 2017-04-28 04:39:39
He is full of shit. Just check his reddit history. He is just a troll with no life 
@_date: 2017-04-23 00:15:52
No just the fact that it is no problem to get as many BTC as I want. Nothing to do with money. Something you have been a failure at

My comment above. "I have been a Bitfinex Client for many years.

He obviously doesnt know how to act in the business world and Kraken is better off without him. Keep up the good work. It will be a pleasure to be a client of yours. 
@_date: 2017-04-27 01:33:47
"I do not own stock in bitfinex, nor do I have any bitcoin or other currencies on their exchange"  Then mind your business and let everyone make their own financial decisions without hearing your mouth

I had to give you an up vote for that Kremer5 LOL Thanks for the laugh. Some people just wont get it and lighten up I guess.. I mean its been a rough week. I think everyone could use a laugh  
@_date: 2017-04-27 02:58:10
Kraken is easy. All you have to do is fill in your info. You dont have to give them any docs. Just fill in your info for Tier 2. You have unlimited crypto deposits and with draws. Unless you want to do FIAT transfers over $2K a day and 10K a month then thats when you need to do the Tier 3. I will post the tiers in a comment below for you

@_date: 2017-01-05 00:37:52
Get over it already.. Only people still crying are nobodies. Any real traders know that loss comes with the territory.. Its all part of the game and if you havent made it back and then some now with this market you need to hang it up and go to bed..

Where are all the trolls at now? I would venture to say if this company they hired is reputable then they are perfectly solvent. Why would anyone in their right mind that is insolvent prove it to the world? 
@_date: 2017-05-06 02:17:50
Why wouldnt it be. If they follow through with it then it will clear the air. It will show they are solvent or insolvent. Plain and simple. 
@_date: 2017-05-10 22:33:46
Yes they just gave me instructions to recover the crypto at least.

@_date: 2017-05-06 01:11:59
Why dont you tweet this? 
@_date: 2017-05-11 14:22:36
Its a problem when I spend $250 on a product and it bricks in 3 months. I am sure I can recover the crypto but it defeats the purpose of buying a quality hardware wallet. I understand its electronics and anything can happen but the lack of replies to support is why I am upset. They still havent emailed me back. 
@_date: 2017-05-06 01:17:10
I like to gamble. How about you AssholeRand1?  I will take the lessor odds. Should be a sure win for you. Lets bet on if Bitfinex can make it. We can use an escrow company. 
@_date: 2017-05-10 22:27:22
Yea but it would have been nice just to shoot a quick email back saying that instead of me having to go look for answers.. Nobody told me about the hard reboot but I hold the button to turn it on and it just goes back to the screen in the pic when it comes on. As far as draining the battery I dont know how that is possible considering it fully charged and shuts off after a min. I am not going to sit here for the next 3 days and keep turning it back on every few mins to kill it completely. Im just disappointed completely I spent good money for this and nobody can seem to contact me to resolve it. Customers shouldnt have to go to reddit to get answers. 
@_date: 2017-05-11 14:28:13
Yea well another day has passed now. I would think if you now acknowledge on reddit that there is a problem with a support ticket it would have been escalated instead of handling this in the public eye. Guess I will hear back in another few weeks when it gets fixed if I am lucky.

He replied above. He is the one who has no life and is on social media 24/7 bashing Bitfinex. He went through so much trouble to make a Twitter, Youtube, and everything else he can think of to spread his fud. He does it so much I dont think the guy has got laid in years.
