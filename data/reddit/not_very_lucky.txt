What the fuck is going on here? 
I get that tons of people bought at the top, but this FUD is insane. Half of the comments on here are talking about the price crashing every time it drops $20. 
I get that you've gotta convince people to sell so that you can accumulate but damn it's annoying that no one has anything to say other than, "btc is ded you're all idiots who have no money" when it's worth over three Grand for each full coin

Because it literally has been easy money for anyone with patience.
I'm sorry that you waited until it peeked to buy in, I honestly am. But making new troll accounts everyday just to trick people? Kind of sad.
Anyone who took the advice of strangers on the internet that said, "you're going to be a millionaire in a month if you buy this now!" Is naive and doesn't understand how the real world works

I honestly don't understand how people can say, "everyone is out of money" like nobody on the planet has any form of income. As soon as the price starts going back up, they'll buy in again after it's started multiplying a few times over

That's exactly what I'm saying. Everyone has their own excuse for wanting to buy it but not actually buying it.
 Once the price rises just over whatever threshold they have created in their own minds they freak out thinking, "I'll never be able to make it if I don't buy NOW!" And then they start throwing everything they have at it, causing the big rushes.

Hell yeah! I know everyone wants to down vote every time someone does something like this, but this is adoption my dudes

Maybe, but no one wants someone constantly telling them that something they believe in is bullshit
