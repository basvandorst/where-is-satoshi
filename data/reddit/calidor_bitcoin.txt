I'm not preordering these in bulk. They are fulfilled as print-on-demand. So my cost is $17 for the shirt and $5 for shipping.
I lowered it $3 bucks, so at least it's at parity with comparable print-on-demand shirts. Any lower and I'll take a loss (due to monthly shop fee, web hosting, domain name).
Thanks for the suggestion though, let's see what happens.

I didn't have a negative intent but I guess everyone can interpret this differently. If the success of bitcoin means anyone could accept it, "your mom" would be the validator of its success. Kind of like how your grandma uses email was a validator of early internet.

The higher the hash rate, the harder it is to counterfeit the blockchain.
Look at this another way -- bitcoin is nearly at the point where only nations and semiconductor companies could muster enough resources to attack the network.

You'll want to inspect/scan the file too, not just the filename (people may have renamed files to hide them in plain sight.) 
Here's a few tools:
Bitcoin Wallet Recovery Tool:
Scans erased drives for wallet.dat:
(I've never used any of them, so not endorsing. Use at your own risk, unplug from network, wear tinfoil, etc).
Also, wallet file may be encrypted, so you'll need to crack the password (there's tools out there, search around you're not the first to ask).
Ethics? I think it's more like finding money in donated clothing and the donors are unknown because it's all in a big heap.
Good luck!

Buy $1 million worth of ASICs and mine them.
@_date: 2013-12-18 06:24:49
A *nation* mining bitcoins would be the ultimate validation of bitcoin.
Think about it: Your bitcoin transactions are verified by ASIC or quantum computers in **secure datacenters, backed by the full faith of a government and defended by their armed forces.** Central banks could use it as an exchange medium between nations.
Minds would be blown. Euphoria. Massive adoption.
The effect on markets would cause prices to skyrocket as people clamor to be early adopters to the world's first viable crypto-currency backed by a nation. 
On the flipside, imagine the FED hoarding coins and doling it out to the chosen few: JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, BofA.
I doubt either scenario will ever happen.

Never touch your retirement until it's time to retire.
But if you have to, you could give yourself a loan with your 401k funds without taking on the penalty.
As long as you make regular payments, keep your job and don't default, it's a less stupid thing to do than an all-out cash distribution.

It's called a paradigm shift. The last one (the internet) turned out pretty ok.
Don't fear the loss of a few jobs when whole new **industries** have yet to reveal themselves. There will be entire careers that will sound just as alien to us today as "Javascript programmer" or "Social media entrepreneur" would sound if you tried to predict it in 1994.

tl:dr -- I think they're calling the top and they believe it's ~$1300. 
Financial firms are getting daily calls from their investors about Bitcoin. They all need to state their position on it, lest they look ignorant about what's happening in the world.
When people move sizeable amounts of money out of their savings/brokerage to "invest" in Bitcoin, it's gotta make some people nervous.

Why not? People attend conventions for stamps, comics, toys and such. There are swap meets and flea markets for antiques, car parts and collectors items. I imagine a bitcoin store would resemble a LAN party or internet lounge more than a swap meet though.
The event staff must provide good security and an entrance fee to keep out the riff raff, as buyers and sellers would be known to be dealing with cash.
There could be a nice on-site opportunity for independent vendors such as escrow, notaries, money order services and check cashing to help deal with large transactions.
If it was always there, like a store, people would meet for Craigslist or Ebay transactions since it's public and the mentioned services are all present.

It was late in the day. The twin suns filtered through the smoky air between marketplace tents.
He wandered through the crowded street passing shrouded figures speaking half a dozen languages. Robed men in respirators were bartering out loud in the common tongue, with at least as many dialects.
He turned left at the ivory fountain, it's jade water spewing forth as it did since the time of the Great Reconstruction. He walked past several stalls beyond the Ionian saffron merchant and stopped at the marbled facade of Abdul Arms. There it was, the hydraulic lifter prosthetics showroom and installation clinic. The sign in front read "BTC welcome".
"How much for the neural-net targeting scope? The one in the box marked version 3 with vectorscope interface". the traveler asked, as a cyborg hawk landed on its perch in the next booth.
"Ahh, you from Europa prime or Colony 2?"
"Damn" he thought, "it couldn't be my accent. I spent three years perfecting the dialect. Or the robes -- it's wrapped in the local fashion. Maybe he noticed that my robes were bought from the skyport. That's it." the traveler pondered to himself, reassessing his newly discovered risk.
The dealer tapped on his temple, pointing at his sunglass-like goggles and smiled:
"...my thermal vision shows you are wearing type 7 ballistic armor under your robes. Who are you hunting?"
"No one. Your Warlords know I'm here. I'm shopping before I head to the jump point. Do you want to make a deal or what? How much for the scope?" the traveler asked impatiently.
"This model? My last one. Excellent range, zero latency. Highest performance. Lightweight nanocomposite. It can penetrate two spectral phases and gives instant feedback. This is why we won the Grid War. Your combat tech no match for our Cybers." the dealer said proudly with a tone of authority.
"For you I charge 250 **bits**."
"That's why I'm here. But the case looks used and I'll need to run it on a simulator. Can't risk burning my retinas testing cold war junk. 100 **bits**.
"It's like new! Analog guts! Diamond semiconductors!" he exclaimed, surprised at the rude tone of his customer. "Ok, 200, no less.  I give you free Rolex, 2399 edition, issued from the King of Cyberia." he said, rolling up his sleeve to reveal several watches.
"100 **bits**. Keep the watch, my doorman tried to sell me three of those for 5000 **satoshi**. They're worth more melted down for scrap."
"I go out of business this price! For you special price 180 **bits**."
"Deal" said the traveler, realizing the extra attention he'd draw was not worth the 30 **bits** saved from extended haggling.
"Here, you take watch. My gift to you." the dealer said empathetically.
"No thanks, I have no use for it." replied the traveler.
"Give it to your kid." he said, now as if they were friends.
"I haven't got... a family." the traveler said, a tragedy behind the two second pause.
"I see." said the merchant, realizing.
He handed him the box as they touched rings. The transaction traveled through several star systems via repeaters and a trillion hashes were verified in milliseconds by moon-sized crypto computers cooled subzero space. All this just to produce a green light on the jewel of their respective rings, confirming the transaction.
"I must be going now. I have a debt to settle on this world." said the traveler.
"God speed my friend! Remember, what you do in this world affects the next!"
"I know." he whispered. "What I'm about to do" he paused, "I'll see the next world soon. Where my family is waiting for me."
