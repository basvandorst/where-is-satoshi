The problem isn't buying things in bitcoin, its having price be set in bitcoin and not float with some fiat currency. 
My tmobile plan is $30 a month, it might change some day, if it does they will let me know with a months notice or so, then it will be $35 or something like that.
With bitcoin most prices are floating with the dollar. So even though my US dollars might have different values from day to do, the price being constant helps me with budgeting and planning and such.

I guess I would view the internet as a distraction for the masses. No one could have predicted things like bitcoin would have come from it. But other than the powerful idea of being able to communicate to anyone, anywhere, for no cost, I can't see the internet bringing down modern democracies. 
Maybe the internet is just in its infancy (it obviously is) and much more powerful things (like bitcoin) will spring up from it. Had they known, they might have been much more restrictive in the beginning claiming only governments should have that kind of technology. I don't doubt its too late for the government to stop the concepts and the eventual adoption of virtual currency by the global populace. I just don't think they will go down without a fight, and that fight could last centuries.

@_date: 2013-04-30 02:53:57
the problem wasn't the Euro or lack of control over the ECB. It was the idea that banks can loan out 99% of the money that they have in deposits. This is a direct result of fractional reserve banking, whenever the reserve ratio is too small if the economy stutters and people want to withdraw their funds the bank won't have them and will have to either close its doors for good or do this odd messed up Cyprus solution.
Since Bitcoin can't be used in fractional reserve banking the same thing can't happen. 
Now if Cyprus wasn't a part of the ECB and the Euro they could have inflated the money instead. Everyone would have felt the pain then for sure, with this current method at least their 100k is still worth 100k. 
@_date: 2013-03-04 01:27:28


doesn't seem like that is why most people are getting bitcoin though. especially subscribers to If your statement is true, than late adopters will not have to worry about the current/future price of bitcoin. Just like my retirement account isn't stored in US dollars, its stored in fractional ownership of companies, I can't imagine that bitcoin should actually be used to store wealth.

Shouldn't it technically grow with inflation? 
If I have one bitcoin today and its worth $30 then using the normal (and perhaps not real) inflation rate. I would expect it to be worth $60 20 years later at 3% rate. 
Even at this slow increase, it would be highly valuable to preserve wealth.
@_date: 2013-03-24 16:51:41


I do not.


It would be as successful as the war on drugs. It would cause a great many problems in society, and people who tend to avoid illegal activities merely because they are illegal will look down upon those who engage in it. 
My typical scenario is the small bar down the street can only sell beer for bitcoins in his bar if such a transaction is considered legal. If its marked illegal, even if poorly defined, some law enforcement agency will eventually come in and confiscate his property in the name of "currency validation". Hell, they could even call him a terrorist for not using the government sponsored fiat currency. Because of this possibility, even if the underground can still use bitcoin (and they will, it will survive) but it will take ages longer to become legitimate, where normal people could discuss it with their financial advisory without being turned over to authorities. 
This would reduce demand of bitcoin as it would be harder to convert it, over a long enough timeline this might not matter, but it bitcoin (and other virtual currencies) could go through a very rough legal patch at some point in the future that prevents it from being accepted and used as an actual currency. The actual price of bitcoin compared to $US during that time may be high or it may be low while people wait to see what will happen. 
If you think that bitcoin is going to be the future, and the odds are better then of course you buy, if you are like me and you think the odds are worse you will wait.

it'll be tough to find a lot of people in who believe your scenario has much likelihood. 
One user did a great job before indicating that he thought there was a 1 out of 500 chance that bitcoin would succeed and that the price (a bit lower at the time) reflected this reality. As the odds of success increase so will the price. I thought this was fair.

I don't have very much of my wealth in US Dollars, just like most bitcoiners seem to do I use US Dollars to value my wealth. 
While it is true that my us dollar holdings would have vastly less buying power in a hyper inflated economy my real estate and stock holdings (while dependent on over all economic health) would not necessarily be affected by hyper inflation. 
One thing that makes me believe that bankers (and the fed) would avoid hyper inflation at all costs is the fact that inflation tends to favor those who owe money rather than have money or are owed money.

obviously if my income stays the same and yet things cost more than I am harmed. Bitcoin doesn't really solve that problem as my income is still in US dollars.

Two issues I have with your statement. 1st, Bitcoin is not a stock and it is not fractional ownership of a company, it does not pay dividends. So it's value can only be capital gains. 
Bitcoin is designed to be deflationary. And unlike companies yearly profits that could be added to current value to determine capital gains and therefore value, bitcoin can't be calculated that way. 
It functions much more like gold or any other commodity, as in an of itself it doesn't add value.

great explanation. 
only part I disagree with is using bitcoin as a preservation of wealth.

It feels like most people are trading $ for ฿ are doing so not to simply save money, but rather to get rich quick.

If bitcoin is as revolutionary as we all think it is, if it removes the ability for the government to print endless IOUs and removes power from the pseudo-secret banking cartels, then it seems like even in failure there is a ton of incentive (and a ton of money) to try and kill bitcoin.

so the bitcoin billionaire is a billionaire due to trading back into dollars or fabrication?

but the supply of the outlawed item (weed) is reduced by making it illegal. Bitcoin supply wouldn't be reduced. The demand would have to go down, making bitcoin less valuable.

hmmm, this is what I've been looking at lately. I'm still new to bitcoin and need to educate myself a lot about it, but seeing the value of bitcoin move as much as it has over the last few months frightens me.
What if I was paid in bitcoin on my labor? My labor wasn't any less valuable in January than it is today. If I use bitcoin as my money I would expect to buy the same amount of food and beer with the same amount of bitcoin in January as I did today. 
what am I missing? shouldn't the value of bitcoin as measured by gold or silver or skittles be constant rather than changing over time?

I tried bitmessage when msn messenger switched to skype as I'd love a good quality replacement messenger. 
bitmessage is a replacement for email not instant messaging.

the more powerful and society-changing bitcoin is suppose to be the more incentive there will be to prevent it from happening.

fractional reserve banking makes me think its hard to own 100% of your deposits.

I kinda felt like the point of bitcoin was that you had to use reputation of both your bitcoin company and the other businesses you transact with since there are no consumer protection laws/rules in bitcoin.

if its being used to store wealth, great, but doesn't function well as a currency if its banned in the US and regular establishments can't accept it.

carrots might qualify as currency in some bunny society, but even then, its bad to consume your currency, makes it much less viable. 
punches in the face probably don't qualify either, although you could argue they are just as easily manufactured as fiat currency, transferring significant sums could be lethal. 


yes and no, only if done with bad PR. internet censorship is very common outside the USA. see the France vs Twitter lawsuit. all they have to do is paint bitcoiners as terrorists and they can pretty much pass any anti-bitcoin law they want. inside the USA you have ATT giving the government full ability to listen in on cellphones, etc. 
only two things I can conclude, either the big banks / big government suits don't care about bitcoin yet or they are playing this out strategically so as to not give bitcoin publicity until they are ready to "squash" it.

thats funny, when I was imagining the media and political environment I imagined the left wanting to ban it. 
haha, both sides will likely agree to ban it, because it threatens current power structures, just like for some reason indefinite detention and all these other bad laws keep passing.

Too high, too fast. People buying now aren't buying because they think bitcoin is worth more today than it was yesterday, they are buying because they think it will be worth more tomorrow. In general they aren't buying it to use as a currency, or even to hedge for retirement, they are buying it to get rich quick. Perhaps not on this but in general. 
I don't think there is enough circulation of bitcoin. So a small amount of trades are determining the price where most people are either buying and holding, or just holding. So its the miners that accumulated overtime that are selling now?
If bitcoin is worth 1000 at the end of the year and 10,000 in 2 years, then what hope has it to become a currency. It feels very much like bubble territory when its on the front page of yahoo, and everyone buys it knowing it could crash but buys anyway.
