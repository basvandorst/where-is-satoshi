That is because I actually provided the wrong link :D
bitblender.io is the correct one. (will edit the first post I made).
I dont think, that this is a question that should be asked tbh.
I think everyone concerns about privacy of the money they deal with, is a proper concern.
While you are right, that you always take a risk in theory, its a risk that many people take and to stay as safe as possible I was seeking advice here =)

Hmm Im not using BTC all too much and when I first started, everyone was using tumblers too make transaction harder to track.
Afaik a simple transaction from the site where you buy your BTC to a site where you wanna use it is easily tracable and I feel more comfortable not having my transaction being tracable.
I dont think of any of changed and I couldnt find any other "simple" way of doing that. IIIRC blockchain.info offers a tool too quickly check if any transactions are tracable and back when I used that first, it was tracable unless I would use Grams/Helix (which is now offline).

That sounds interesting =)
But you stated its not really for noobs and Im not using BTC too much, so I assume its not worth the hassle learning how to do it with smaller amounts etc, as I will always loose a bit for transactions etc. and a popular tumbler will cut a bit aswell, but is easier to use.
If I ever plan on doing more business within BTC, I will definately looker deeper into it, thanks for your info! =)

Who cares, you are obviously making an account to annoy people over there and trashtalk them.
Nobody cares if your opinion is "good or bad", I judge you based on your actions and you acted like a idiotic child, that desperately wants to make his point.
And now you want to brag about your shitty behaviour in this subreddit. Be assured, most people dont care how hard you bash on bcash, you just fuel the fire, giving them a reason to hate on the BTC-community. Sorry, but BTC doesnt need you to be protected. Do your business, let others do their business and if you think bcash sucks, make profit of those people, call we all know, ones bash is gone, the go back to BTC or ETH and we all profit from them being stupid.

Hey everyone, English isnt my native language and I dont understand what "shorten" means in this case, can somebody help me out? °-°

Thats parts of his channel. The interviewer is know for beng awkwards, its somewhat of his trademark. His older content makes this very clear. But he changed his channel and does alot of interviews. Hope that helps

If anyone could just control the whole of BTC, BTC wouldnt be worth anything. Unrealistic bullshit

I bought a bit at 6200€/BTC and it instantly dropped to 5000€ before my payments where made ;D hoping for it to grow back now haha

I got a hint that I should delete and post somewhere else, so the original post is deleted now, but if you remember waht i wrote, you should know, that I wasnt asking about anything KNOWING anything, but about expected recovery. I found multiple people giving me good knowledge before, so why wouldnt that be the case here aswell?
As "newbie" I wasnt sure what to do with a stuck transaction for example and someone told me (back then), that the transaction will be confirmed in roughly 2 days, because miners will be back at BTC. Exactly 2 days later this happened and my transaction got confirmed without me doing anything.
I thought, I amde pretty clear, that Im not dumb and that I know, that I cant just make a reddit thread asking people is something will rise or get lower, I was just trying to gain information. You gave no information at all tbh and wasnt helping me or anyone else, sorry....

You seem to know what you talk about. I have a transaction of 40 mBTC "stuck". According to my app the size is 191 bytes and the fees are set to 0.443 mBTC (it say that is 2.312 mBTC/kB).
Any way to get it unstuck or any idea on how long that took take to bee confirmed without me doing anything? 
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:05:24
See, thats helping out alot more =) I dont know much about the dynamics, but with the info I got from that guy, it sounded like similar things happened before aswell, so if the miners keep working on BTC there could be a high chance of a full recovery. Like I said, Im just looking to gain some knowledge.
I know "everything" can basically happen and it wasnt my intention to sound like "tell me how to make profit" hehe :P
From everything I read for now, I will wait until like 2 hours before I have to sleep, if it doesnt like good then, I will just rebuy the little rest. Its just so little and the site I use offers 0.01 minimum for buying BTC :D
I know We arent talking about much money here, but neither do i have much, so I still have to care hehe
Thanks for the input! Cheers

Great end of bitcoin-endscenario you painted there aswell.
@_date: 2018-03-17 19:54:45
What are you even talking about? You know how I run my stuff? You are making dumb assumptions out of nowhere, sounds trustworthy.
@_date: 2018-11-19 20:31:35
Then you are dumb. Buying into something when it has already skyrocketed is like asking to loose your money.

You sound like the perfect guy I would want in my casino. If I had one.

I dont know how much you know about CCs, but a statement such as "my definition of cheap is under $10000" sounds really dangerous to me... There is nothing to back that statement up. Sounds like you are speculating, that it will for sure go above that threshhold again, but there is no logical reason at this point to think that.
We just had the biggest high in CC ever and its normal to drop afterwards, but nobody can know how much exactly. To me its fairly obvious, that alot of people started getting into BTC around that time and then the price dropped again and alot of people left again, cause atm it is not really a currency you can use to buy your everday-needs. Im hopeful, that once it settles abit more (which could happen due to the lightning network being implemented), you can actually use your BTC for more than just investing and darknet markets.
Dont forget, the longtimegoal of EVERY CC has to be to become an actual usable currency. If this doesnt happen, this really is just a big bubble that investors use to make money. In the long run, this is a dead end if there is no actual use for private people aswell.
If you have been making profits fornow, keep your business going and dont start getting into it too much, jsut be happy with what you already have and make sure you cant get fucked over now.

Yeah, now that it went down, sell XD
There is no way of making your comment not sound uneducated ;D
