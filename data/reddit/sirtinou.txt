Life is about being happy. It doesnt make anyone happy to waste countless hours every day having to find out if someone isnt exactly like other people in general. People chose to assume and adjust if they are wrong, its much faster than having to please every goddamn 0,0001% special snowflake.
Also most people don't give a shit if you're a woman or a man, it's just confirmation bias on your part because the few times it happens, you get triggered out of your mind.
If someone assumes im x or can't do y.. you know what? i don't give a shit i let them think it and i continu to live my life. Almost everyone is deeply retarded, it can't be fixed.

Tech is mostly men, so people expect men to be in tech.. Way to get your panties up in a bunch over facts. People are dying because they don't have clean water, the planet is dying because of pollution, animals are getting fked by plastic... And you spend all your energy getting mad that people assume things that are generally true. Just Fking get over it and move on, life is short,. Stop getting offended over everything. Just live your life.

can you stop spewing bull? Nobody thinks girls can't be gamers. Normal people(non-neckbeard/ non-forever alone virgin anime maniacs) don't believe any of that. Most ebgame stores are staffed entirely by women gamers.
Not everyone is an incel. 
and oh.. this gender crap isnt scientifically proven. It does not actually matter enough for it to be proven anyways. People do what they want and you bringing it up constantly just makes people want to hate instead of accept. Keep your sexuality for yourself, it's not something that's supposed to be public.
