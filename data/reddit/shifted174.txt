I just want it to fall back to 12k, not any lower.
@_date: 2017-12-17 17:34:19
Oh, that's pretty petty.

I wrote some shitty early high school level c++ program doing exactly what you need after I got bored of having to write everything by hand.

The cost is pretty relative. When I bought my Trezor I was kinda bummed that I could've just held those bits and that I'd potentially lose value, only to 'make' the cost back in less than 3 weeks.

Shamelessy downvoted you

Oh, does he actually own blockchain.info? I've been wondering as of why the price of btc is substantially lower than the mean value on CMC. Is it somewhat skewed or what?
@_date: 2017-12-01 00:02:46
Psychological milestone. Similar concept to btc reaching 10k.

If I was about to send ±1.6 fucking million dollars I'd spend one hour just to make sure I've copied and pasted the right address. This smells like made up tho.

Happened to me a little while ago, converted some BTC -&gt; DASH that didn't go through because the amount was too small, actually smaller than yours.
I've sent an email with my ticket  and although the amount was apparently too low to be able to go through, it was still able to get to the point of attempting to be sent and eventually it got stuck. There's a chance you won't have to go through having to cancel the transaction since your amount should be high enough to be processed. Just send them an email with your ticket # and you should be able to get them unstuck.
They asked for a substantial amount of the BTC I've been refunded in order for them to send it back to my wallet. Mind you I never had any choice
So yeah, I had to pay extra for a refund that was 100% their fault. That's how you repeal repeat costumers :)
I'd not recommend changelly anymore for anyone. Try using a crypto exchange instead.

Short answer: Yes, but not right now.
Long answer: I'd refrain from buying right now. The price is at a historically all-time high, but although there's no sign of it stopping to increase, we could and should be expecting a slight dip for the next days. Keep in mind that the holiday season is coming, so you'd expect people to be selling to get money for presents / vacations / NYE / etc. Also, people will be selling due to the high price.
My prediction would be BTC going back to 11.5k-12k so it can properly adjust to the market, then slowly be starting to climb up to +15k following 2018.
I'd start ~~investing~~ speculating around the time when it goes to 11.5k-12k.

She thinks she's so damn smug using latin words.
@_date: 2017-12-17 16:43:28
I don't really understand what they are trying to do here. Are they trying to get your email from you so you'd get put on some BTC owners lists and then proceed trying to hack you?

There's this episode of Mr.Robot where a prostitute offers the main character a blowjob for cryptocurrency.

Just don't obsess over these kinds of sudden changes. Historically drops have been even worse, so as far as you buy only what you can safely afford losing it's gonna be fine.
@_date: 2017-11-03 08:10:05
So you are saying I can keep them in that wallet until I get those Segwit2x coins and then I can transfer? There won't be any issues with my current BTC after the fork? Also, I've had BTC in there pre-1st of August, does that mean I also have some BCH in there?
Thank you!

I just bought at $7100. Just slightly bugged I did not wait 10 more damn minutes to drop sub 7k.
Next week I reckon I'll have made a profit tho so no worries, don't panic hodlrs
EDIT: Yep, sitting on a small profit rn :D
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:02:58
That's a cool idea if the return profits impacted your life in a very meaningful way. That being said, just don't get an in your face tattoo you can't cover up easily if required, something small and classy will do the job. It can also be a good conversation starter or a recipe for getting kidnapped.

Already invested my monthly quota. I'll just wait and see how it pans out :D
@_date: 2017-11-10 14:10:09
In 1 week back to 7.5k.
In 4 weeks new ATH!
Mark my words.
Nah, just kidding. I agree there's no way to know how it's gonna go.
EDIT1: less than 1 week &gt;7.5k :)
@_date: 2017-11-19 22:20:36
As far as i understand the way private keys are generated they are basically a long string of characters simplified as random words. I might not be worth it / possible to use multiple lang dicts, but I'm just talking out of my ass. I do see how it can def improve security
@_date: 2017-11-20 22:49:47
True story, last time I bought in the 7k-&gt;5.6k dip started minutes after :D
@_date: 2017-11-12 13:40:36
I used [changelly]( It's fast, easy, and the rate is alright. You send you BCC and it goes straight back into your BTC wallet as BTC. 
Mind you, you may have to use this [address translator]( to send your BCC, at least on wallets from BitPay you have to. You translate the receiver's address and then use the translated address to send from your BCC wallet.

@_date: 2018-02-08 21:42:26
I'm sure most of those people have some procedure set up in case they die and their vast amount of BTC goes without an owner. I know I would.
@_date: 2018-02-07 15:20:57
yeah nice try
