I think eventually investment in bitcoin will become similar to investments in other fiat currencies, such as buying the Yen when its low and selling when its high for another fiat.
But this is still contingent on BTC becoming a commonly used currency.

The code is open source. If there were any back doors it would've been caught by now. Satoshi controls Bitcoin no more than I do (that is to say you control it as much as you own the network)

Waiting for the threats of lawsuit against the researchers....
@_date: 2018-08-16 03:21:36
Exactly like that. I'm expecting them to threaten legal action against the researchers for exposing the security hole.

I was talking about network control not economic control.

What's the exchange rate of BTC to Bologna these days?

I'd love to use my BTC IRL or online, but no retailers in my region are taking it.... Come on New Zealand, modernize already

I just keep buying anyway and getting more bang for my buck each time.
Eventually the market will reverse. Not sure when, but it'll probably take a while to climb back to over 7k, and I have all the time in the world

Eh, this happens every time. There's an uptick, EVERYONE buys, then there's a sell off of some who want to exit with profit, before it continues to grow at a more sustainable rate

I'm just buying every few weeks and using it when I can. I don't see this as an investment, just another form of cash. If it goes up it's just like having a strong forgien currency

Pics or it isn't happening

Only time any of my crypto has been on exchanges is when I'm buying or selling. Cold wallet every time it's idle
