If satoshi wanted to avoid spam, why did he not implement fees?
@_date: 2015-06-23 00:14:56


Nobody would mine at a loss. If the delay in propagation of blocks does give a headstart to the miner, they have more "profit" in the long run &amp; so they would do it. Gavin's simulations say there is no such effective headstart, f2pool's behavior suggests otherwise.


Assume that 10% miners are mining honestly including everything etc and 90% just immediately start mining. Since they get a headstart by not processing the transactions searching for fees, or by freeing up bandwidth because they only care about previous block's hash to come through and do not care about public's transactions etc. they would earn more coins in long run than the 10% ones. Since all of them are paying equally for electricity, equipment etc, the honest 10% will be at a disadvantage. This would mean either the fees will rise and thus lesser people using it and thus dropping the value of bitcoin or it would mean them realising this and immediately selling thus crashing the price themselves..
@_date: 2015-06-23 00:02:35
Yes I wrote that by mistake, I was thinking the right thing, but was too busy thinking that even if majority is bad, the % of clean miners are the ones that are effectively sustaining the network then, and this is similar to rich people corrupting in govt by the virtue of their richness but not providing the value they need to provide yet availing the incentive; just because they got in by their richness. So my mind was like, even if honest people are 10%, bitcoin is fine, but the 90% are getting bitcoins and selling it off so what would be the effect?? Is this the beginning of corruption in bitcoin??&amp; so on.. That 10% figure came out like that, but yes its a mistake..I corrected it..
@_date: 2015-06-23 02:59:38
Absolutely, but how is it related here? Did you get what I meant?
@_date: 2015-06-03 07:38:13
But his has an additional advantage. If someone legit paid to send you a mail, you can return their money! So the proof-of-work is reusable in a sense. [Technically, POW is still required to validate the transaction but since it is performed for a bulk it is still much much lesser than hashcash.]
@_date: 2015-06-23 00:18:25
It's easier for the rich to get into the government because they can buy lobbying power and effect people with advertisements, thus corrupting it. People don't care about it because even if a minority of elected people are clean, their roads get built.
Dirty miners are these rich people, buying their power into mining. Even if minority is clean and transactions go through, people don't care. 
But in the long run, both of the above systems are parasitic behavior &amp; will crash their ecosystem - their respective economy.

@_date: 2015-06-22 22:07:58
1. If a pool has advantage in the mining race to skip searching for transactions with fees, when it receives a confirmation for a block, then Gavin should have his answer and must really talk to them to understand it. Either the pool will learn that its not advantageous and will start including because of transaction fees or else Gavin will learn that assuming that '20sec' in his simulation was faulty maybe.
2. If it really is beneficial then more pools will start doing this, bitcoin becomes insecure and susceptible to delay in confirmations. Thus people who want to use bitcoin will invest in mining. If 'propagation delay advantage' is really something then I see more mining power in the future. Also, brings out another anti-fragile nature of this amazing protocol.
3. Miners who do not want their held bitcoins worthless must get off such pools playing dirty to secure value in long run, or start selling immediately not caring about long run. Thus if most miners are dirty, price will come down really fast and force them to act clean.

@_date: 2015-05-18 13:07:03
Why do we pay fees? If the miners don't make enough money then they get out of mining and profits rise and that brings in more miners. Thus it is self balancing. This is true irrespective of what that profit value is. Fees is understandable once all the bitcoins have been mined, but why now?

Ya, read about various models in the article .. 
First model, fixed price by content creator --&gt; sorry creators dont know in advance their content's worth; needs fluidity
Second model is pure democracy and is a recipe for disaster just like zapchain.
Third model is again non-fluid and appears prone to sybil attack
Fourth model, fixed price again, no fluidity
Fifth model is great but for it to work needs to solve the discovery problem which is really hard and no mention of how yours does it
The last model is great but users will run out of money over time just like in zapchain.

I am not saying 'could not'. We should be able to pay fees to optimize miner policy but people should be aware that this is not a compulsory fees. It should definitely not be inbuilt by default like most clients.

'Open assets' implementation is the lipstick. 
In the end the only thing that enforces Alice to really transfer those assets is the force of law. Which you could already do. Its just like the notary office went online. 
To understand the depth of it think of it like this. What if the banks really simplified their apps so much that they let you whatsapp money? What difference is bitcoin to the end user then? The difference is control. Who enforces that that money actually got transferred? 
@_date: 2015-05-18 13:24:59
Both of the reasons make sense, but:
1. Yes I would like to say "Here take some money and confirm me first", but people should know this! Most don't and it should not be termed as a 'fees' since that is totally optional.
2. So did we have situations in past where dust transactions like satoshidice clogged the network? Let them! Whats the harm? Miners first process the prioritized transactions, and then if they have space let dust go through. If blocks are full, dust will wait. Whats the harm?
@_date: 2015-05-21 05:49:44

Colored coins, open assets etc are all just fancy names. What you are basically doing is declaring that a bitcoin address X is now associated to some asset A, say a car. Whoever holds the private keys to X owns A. If all the money in X goes to Y then Y is the new owner.
* Nothing is binding you to hold your declaration or even check if your declaration is valid, but the central lawmakers. Me and you could both be claiming to own the same A, who is to decide? The law.
* Only digital assets can have some inbuilt mechanism that ensure that indeed A owns the private keys to X.
We already knew we could save messages in a transaction. They just put lipstick on it.

It would literally be just copying bitcoin and changing the name. The problem is no one used it for anything.

I am not denying it is not turing complete, but I did not say do 'in'; I said do 'with'. 
For example, there could be an ether-tcp that transports data using unused header bytes. Now factually you don't send data 'in' TCP header so TCP-ether might seem better, but actually you can send data 'with' TCP and thus TCP-ether is redundant.
Think of any Ethereum usecase and you can do it with bitcoin.
(PS: I have developed on ethereum &amp; many other blockchains like NXT, dash etc. It is my hobby to study a technical use-case of an altcoin &amp; then try to implement it in bitcoin. Eg: 'x of 1,000 multisig, where each signature is controlled by a trade-able token' can be done in bitcoin using schnorr sigs+colored coins.)

Andreas answers everything wrong with this subreddit Most of the people on here are due to the 2013 bubble and dream of bitcoin rising in value. Any logical argument against bitcoin is downvoted even though it might be cryptocurrency supportive.
According to Washington Post in 2014, 927 people held half the bitcoins. Just think about this for a second.
Bitcoin is just the first printing press. We all have printing press waiting for us to single click and start printing our own. And very soon it will be a popularity contest. And the value of a currency will not depend on who issued it (or first mover's advantage in bitcoin's case) but who uses it.
Although it might seem like a long time, but hell even the internet has just started. Only 1% of Indians have personal reach and no 99% of India is not poor. You squatters (myself guilty) will only gain if bitcoin is the one that wins this popularity contest but there are so many use cases for tweaking those variables (like 10 min blocktime etc) that no one, I repeat no one currency will win the popularity contest.
Anyone wanna bet we will have more than 10,000 active altcoins 5 years from now? The utility of tweaking variables is far more than the utility of popularity. 
This is where blockchain is NOT like the internet. There will be no internet of money, but a lot of intranets.

Indian economists have helped the nation tremendously in the past &amp; Indians really love their banks. The 2008 recession only had mild effects in India, thanks to the govt &amp; RBI.

* CoinSecure saw huge growth and is now hiring aggressively &amp; apps are in work
* Unocoin went through BoostVC and is part of Liquid!
People are becoming aware and scams like iGot, Trestor etc. are closing shop or finding really hard to grow.
BlockchainU has been really pushing Bitcoin &amp; Ethereum in the major corporates, with major Indian IT cos spending on training - Infosys, TCS, Cognizant, Broadridge, Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) etc. all have had BlockchainU sessions and hackathons in past 6 months.
New meetups are cropping up each month. College hackathons are also happening with the latest one in IIM-B, IIT-B &amp; IIT-Kgp.
Officially too, Indian banker is the least bad in the world. They issued just precautionary warnings &amp; really understand cryptocurrencies.

I think this point is not understood by core devs either as demonstrated by introduction of fees. The rationale is to determine order of inclusion for txs and to maintain some incentive after all btc has been mined.
The first part makes sense but then should be optional and zero fee txs should be default, whereas fo the second part..
..imagine all coins have been mined(2140) and there is no fees, who mines then?? 
The nodes. To protect themselves.

Hell the users will isolate BU miners by staying on the current consensus rules. All of their chain, albeit built with more hashing power, is useless since the classic honeybadger bitcoiners don't give a fuck; they regard the large blocks as simply invalid and let BU network enjoy its blocks and hashing power..

In real life, **cashier says thank you and man walks out.**
If there is a double spent attempt, the bar's wallet automatically creates a a subsequent transaction sending 100% of the funds to mining fees. All replace-by-fee miners will mine that transaction, rather than the one sending the funds back to the fraudster, and there is nothing the fraudster can do about it.
**Practical version**: "Sir although the coffee is 5$, since you're using RBF please pay 5.5$ and accept this future tx sending 0.5$ back to you." [The transaction can also be constructed such that the payee pays slightly more in advance, with the merchant refunding the extra amount once the transaction confirms, to ensure that a double-spend will result in a net loss for the fraudster.]

Yes, they are attacking but no, it doesn't look like a 51% attack where the attackers double spends a coin.. Here the attacker is trying to convince the nodes to switch to his altcoin by showing mining power superiority over whatever bitcoin's then mining hashrate is..
A double spend attack causes confusion in nodes about history; this attack is not doing so.
A PoW change aims to solve chain resolution to determine which miner is hashing which network; this is already solved in this attack as there is no confusion in the first place.

I think the wording at play here is interesting. Actually the "longest chain is bitcoin" does apply but the definition of 'chain' encapsulates the consensus rules and thus a system with different consensus rules than the current system are not even a valid chain. So the question of longest doesn't even arise, if its not even a 'chain'.
@_date: 2017-03-20 11:46:45

thats what I said! they are changing consensus rules, and not 51% attacking. Eg, imagine 51% miners mining BU large blocks, the classic btc software running nodes remains undisputed on its own fork (no 51% attack!) but with lesser hashrate support and thus weaker but it is distinguishable(unlike a real double spend 51%attack where we get confused about the history); PoW change doesnt accomplish anything extra..

Ya I too lol'd when I first read about it .. But the way the system works is that at each step of delivery, the transaction that pays that delivery cost also triggers the next one and thus, the act of someone in the provenance chain accepting the goods for further delivery sort of acts like this oracle because their real life actions automatically triggers one of the paths in the smart contract.

@_date: 2015-08-25 12:46:49
I feel its very important in the blocksize debate. 
Big blocks give a headstart to a miner &amp; thus further centralize mining. The argument against this is Gavin's simulations. However, most devs feel that Gavin's sims do not account for latency and even if they did, simulations do not represent real life and are not very important in networked situations. You might have seen them discussing planet-lab.
So, many people on the XT side admit that centralization due to big block size might be a problem, but since mining is already centralised due to variance in mining, why not let it centralize further at the expense of increasing the user base. 
Now, If work is done on eliminating centralization due to mining variance then only the XT side would clearly be seen proposing centralization.

You have a lot of influence in the community. Why don't you propose this? Since it essentially resolves this debate. 
Most of the people argue that since mining is already centralized so much due to this variance, we might as well do it further; atleast we will support the increase in user base.
If such a framework were to exist, it would decentralize mining &amp; solve many problems.
@_date: 2015-08-30 16:11:52
Intermittent network is bad for bitcoin because of various reasons like centralization due to large blocks, selfish mining and most importantly a headstart to the miners. 
Gavin had run simulations to prove that these are non-issues, but the argument against these is that those sims do not account for latency. And why are they opposed to implement a test first? Anyways, even if we observe that these are non-issues we must be able to explain the reason behind non-occurrence of mathematically predicted phenomenon.

Firstly, no, it is not a fundamental need however it does change the fundamentals of the protocol and that is dangerous. 
Secondly, people's excitement about something is just good advertising &amp; does not matter in technical decisions. Moreover, most users are in bitcoin just because they want a return on investment; they don't care if bitcoin dies because of this change 10 years later.
Thirdly, those users who do not have their own copy of blockchain are not true users. These are the users who are okay to put their trust in some third party. They still use bitcoin because a. It is limitless both geographically &amp; amount-wise b. It is 24x7 and c.It is somewhat anonymous. So these users, are in bitcoin, just because banks are lazy, since banks can give all those features(and in future will, due to competition from bitcoin) except anonymity and then all these users would go back using bank money happily. Not having your own copy of blockchain is similar to using a bank that hosts the ledger for you.

It requires a soft-fork and mechanism is given in Appendix B.

Sidechain is a special blockchain with some special properties.
What happens is that Alice locks her bitcoins by sending a special type of transaction. Then she waits. (This waiting is called an SPV proof (Simplified payment verification proof) because the total difficulty of blocks produced in this waiting time proves that Alice's locking transaction was genuine.)
After this waiting time (usually a day or 2, called as confirmation time) is over, Alice announces on the sidechain that her coins are now in the sidechain. She does this by sending a special transaction on the sidechain. Again, she needs to wait for some time as an SPV proof(called as contest period). Thats it. Now her bitcoins are locked and sent to the sidechain and she can transact there. 
When she (or future owner) requires to send the coins back from the sidechain to bitcoin, all of the above is done again - send the coins on the sidechain to an SPV-locked output, produce a sufficient SPV proof that this was done, and use the proof to unlock a number of previously-locked outputs with equal denomination in bitcoin. 
Since someone might also send their litecoins to this sidechain, coins on this sidechain are not fungible &amp; cannot be mixed with each other.

Places offering courses are rushed.
* There are no trusted simulators to simulate a network. 
* With all the altcoins out there, there are still untweaked parameters. For eg, research on a fast lived chain that pays out all coins in matter of hours/days/weeks
* All currencies face the blocksize problem, and we do not how it will pan out. There are other problems in the protocol such as binomial distribution of blockreward probability due to randomness leading to mining variance.
* The protocol has problems in itself. But the implementation has too. The devs had not suspected soft forks of this nature hence now we have BIP SIPA. 
Bitcoin is so young, it must be studied, before we rush to teach it. But well who cares because ... profit.

As someone pointed out, Ethereum manages this by isolating the execution in a virtual environment. Just take a step back and look at it - bitcoin is not allowing loops; You introduce turing complete languages but that brings you problem of absolute power to counter which you introduce a virtual machine. This increased the complexity and only made the system more susceptible to bugs.
A simplified version would be to keep the execution away from blockchain. You are accessing third-party oracles anyways.

To be a bitcoin user you need the ability to (a)secure private keys &amp; (b) run full nodes.. We lost the latter on the way due to the greed of trying to spread it. Had people been running full node wallets they'd have resisted big blocks. Anyways, I am not worried because those who do not, will suffer the punishment when systems they rely on (coinbase, blockchain.info, etc.) start to fail (already have in the past).

Firstly, no, my write-up does not describe the LN. I wrote all that to make you realize that there are other ways possible to grow than 'natively only'.
Secondly, native growth is not safe. Almost everyone agrees that increase the blocksize increases centralization and the argument given is that since mining is already so centralised, why care. I ask you to sincerely think, that if there is a problem in bitcoin protocol, should we try to correct it or worsen it?

This talk was very imporatant in making people realize the status of the community and various governance curves that occur during its lifetime, but it did not provide any answers as to how, even from a historical context. jtimon's question did not have any answers and that actually is because bitcoin is unlike any other community in history due to various controversial distinguishing factors.

Firstly, you should have a master key and associated mechanism that gets released when you die, according to what you will, which encrypts your entire wealth inheritance in not just bitcoins but everything.
Once you have that, every time you spend your bitcoins, mail your family an encrypted transaction sending rest of the bitcoins with nlocktime 1 year in future to them. If you die, they decrypt it with your master key and claim the coins. Delayed because otherwise family comes to know of your spending patterns.

I am still stating they increase the capacity though not in a native sense. Yes they do so in apparent sense. You did not answer why "absolute" was important.
I will give you two examples, one very accurate and another little vague.
First the vague one.
Let us say, me and you were connected with a connection transferring data at the speed of light &amp; were playing a game real-time. Let's say we face delay in signal because the data transfer speed is greater than our move speeds. Now what do we do? We reduce the size of the data transferred. Even if we reduced them to really small move commands and that was not enough what next is left? Encode them into bits, and we cant go any smaller. Note that during this encoding we abstracted the data, by keeping some context at either end of gaming clients where they both agreed that certain bits meant certain move. If an animation involved several such moves we can further reduce the data size by clubbing them together and abstracting them. Thus using abstraction, and in a way preprocessing/caching, we were able to send more data over the same data size &amp; speed without increasing the "actual" capacity of the connection. The internet uses the OSI model whose layers are abstraction on top of each other. LN is an abstraction on top of bitcoin where it does increase the capacity by abstraction of information.
Now a practical example. 
A sends some coins to B and B sends all these coins to C. If we say after a period of time instead, that A had sent those coins to C, the definition of that coin remains intact and the blockchain had to bear one less transaction. This is known as 'transaction cut-through' and forms the starting basis for LN. In this example the transaction A-&gt;C bore in itself more "meaning" than appears. We can draw an analogy to the same electrical signals that only used to denote the voice in a phone call, now denotes various kinds of data, not just audio, by abstracting the data either end, where each impulse of the signal now "means" more than just a moment of voice. We essentially sidechained the "Hello Hello"s indroduction to 'handshake protocols'.
@_date: 2015-09-09 09:00:41
This is a biased headline. **Everyone wants to upgrade bitcoin's capacity** - one side believes blocksize increase is the only way to do it, other sides is adamant at other methods because they feel blocksize increase is harmful.

* ANY self-respecting wallet that does decent fees estimation basically has been requesting RBF since forever, so that they can give a lower estimation of fees without the risk that you suffer a confirmation time longer than you want.
* Secondly, various kinds of fancy smart contract really need replacement to work correctly (or are subject to jamming when someone announces a refund transaction prematurely.)
@_date: 2015-11-25 00:49:07
Not at all related though. Duplex channels are much like LN channels though..
@_date: 2015-11-30 11:06:30
The fees is lowered not by trying to send lower fees txs but the other way round. If you tell the wallet you want your tx to be included within 60 minutes, then it can first try with no fee, then min fee, etc and can go on increasing. So miner would include the ones with higher fees.
@_date: 2015-11-30 08:56:40
Sorry, how is block size relevant here?

Zero conf is unsafe anyway. A pay processor would see the flag and wait for 1 conf instead.


It's opt-in not opt-out, so wallets can do what they want.


They would not. User doen't need technical details. Suppose you are non-centrally exchanging your bitcoins for litecoins using atomic swap protocol or say MaidSafe and the other party runs away. The software would then relay the refund tx and get you your money back. Without RBF that may fail. User doesn't need to understand all this. The software UI encapsulates this for them.
@_date: 2016-10-03 15:18:49
"Decentralized exchange" is a broad term, so if you mean something like EtherEx, lol, then it is a so-called smart contract that provides a way to exchange ethereum sub-currencies only.
Here is how to do it with bitcoin:
1. Head over to colu and make your sub-currency
2. Atomically swap them using any protocol
3. ???
4. Profit
I am laughing so hard man.

Take time and give me one use case that you can do with ether but not with bitcoin &amp; I'll tell you how to do it with bitcoin.

Not a good solution. You are giving up your power and trusting the majority as right. If many do it, the ones who don't centralize the system to their will. Also, how exactly is this without a third party?
@_date: 2016-10-03 17:51:16
So EtherEx smart contract solves the discovery problem? 
You can't name one thing ether can do but btc can't. No one can. I have tried HN, btctalk, r/ethereum, twitter , everything.... no one has ever been able to give one example and if someone actually reads computer science they know that it never will be because DSLs do not need turing completeness.

I'd say what Peter Todd said, "Any concrete plans yet for how that will work?". Also, "With P2Pool miners with lower latency to the average P2Pool node earn more money." "P2Pool doesn't have discovery problems; does have economic problems."
You know there are people who don't even believe in LN or sidechains even though peer reviewed whitepapers exist. Here there's not even a plan one can read.
I am a guy working all my waking life on bitcoin and would be really interested in knowing how 21 plans to do this.

Its appears so at first glance but if you look closely at the holes the locks go into, those holes are on different piece of metal and they form a chain, so opening one sets all the ones on its left free.

Liquid is a 'real' sidechain.
@_date: 2016-10-03 18:29:07
Bitcoin didn't have a pre-sale so I can't say for sure if something like that is being built, because its an open-source bitcoin world that owes me nothing, you know.
Can it be built? Sure. Something like IPFS for the decentralized orderbook and bitcoin of the participants can remain locked using OP_CLTV. What bitcoin or even ethereum cant do is tell who won in real life, so both need third party oracles for that. So assuming a third-party oracle such a smart contract script is easy to write.
Should it be done though? Prediction markets is not a generic market of all predictions possible; wisdom of crowd principle only applies to certain queries not all, not even most, whereas Augur makes no such distinction. Even a mob of Messi's can't predict the outcome of world-cup. No such market can exist, whereas such markets are rampant on Augur.
Augur says they'll move to bitcoin sidechain as soon as its possible.
This is a second use-case now. I said only one because I have actually taken the time to figure out how each of the dapps listed on ethercast can be done with bitcoin. Mathematically, I had figured it out way earlier and had even posted the possibility of DAO hack type attacks even before ethereum launch and Vitalik had even replied to that post but not acknowledged the problem.
Theoretically, a method to do anything possible in ethereum in bitcoin, will always exist.

Rampant fraud! Txs with RBF are clearly marked with a flag to indicate them to be different from normal transactions, so I don't think I agree with you.

(On the one hand pools are racing so much as to risk the ecosystem by SPV mining and otoh you think they'd delay, when the fees could even be lesser rather than greater?)

RBF is also needed if you have to cancel your tx before 10 minutes due to various reasons such as smart contracts, atomic swaps, decentralized exchanges, lower fees estimation by wallets etc.

This is sad in so many ways. 
*1. One guy is deciding stuff. Backed by thedev group;  not very decentralized.
*2. No alternatives to resist this.
*3. Bitcoin no longer equals 100mil satoshis! only 00000 !!! 
*4. Goes against the ideology of the original paper by Satoshi which clearly states that btc is created for small transactions.
*5. I believe value of btc will rise. at 184+ you wont be able to pay in pennies. At 1842+ not in tens ofpennies. At 18416+ not in dollars. [I believe btc can rise upto this value]
*6. The sum of 54.3uBTC was chosen based on 'current value in dollars' it seems. Disappointing! Why are we comparing to fiat? We aim to move away from it.
Practically this is a change in the protocol and the way bitcoin works.
