The same could be said for the 120K, but they revealed that. ?

Hello. I'm wondering about this statement in the FAQ about BitGo wallet security: "Further, since we now enforce multi-institutional second factor authentication (Bitfinex will be the first factor and BitGo the second factor), attackers are required to compromise both institutions before getting funds."
But you said BitGo was not compromised! So I am really confused what has happened? Either BitGo was compromised or the setup wasn't done as intended? Or is there another explanation?
Second, I'm wondering what percent of Bitfinex's bitcoin holdings were stolen, in general ballpark terms? I.e, the 120K bitcoin is what percent of the total on the platform?
@_date: 2016-08-03 23:46:23
So, if Bitfinex takes the position of "individualized losses" (which I'm not saying they will and certainly hope they wouldn't), you not only have your loss but also now an enforceable personal debt to whomever lent you those Bitcoin?
@_date: 2016-08-03 12:53:31
Me too! I have a "Bitfinex" wallet showing on "BitGo" with a $0 balance. So I thought I was hacked for sure. But then I noticed it said it had no transactions ever, so I guess it is not the correct wallet address to be checking. I don't know what the correct address(es) is/are, and I guess we won't until Bitfinex comes back up.
@_date: 2016-08-03 23:29:03
I'm not a lawyer, and I can't figure out what the TOS's mean in this situation. But the harshening tone of zanetackett is starting to sound like losses will be borne by individuals, not collectivized.
Maybe it depends on the scope of loss... 
 ?
@_date: 2016-08-04 04:28:27
Do you have any analogies that relate to commodity trading exchanges?
@_date: 2016-08-04 00:27:44
Legal injunctions on withdrawals will surely be incoming if you don't make this clear before reopening and continue implying these are losses in "individualized wallets". Then you're going to be facing a court-supervised process. Maybe that's best though, unless you have a secret bailout plan for the funding. This sucks. But I would rather get a haircut than roll the dice on a wipeout.
@_date: 2016-08-04 01:48:53
This is a bit troubling. Not sure we're using the same concept of what a haircut is.
I am predicting injunctions.
@_date: 2016-08-04 12:54:27
Again, I do appreciate a lot your energy and efforts to communicate. :)
@_date: 2016-08-04 01:17:33
Actually, per the terms of service, some guy named Michael in San Diego will decide this in arbitration. :/
@_date: 2016-08-03 23:20:35
I really hope you will explain what percentage of total BTC holdings the 120K represented!!
@_date: 2016-08-04 01:22:01
Dude, maybe I'm venting at you wrongly. Your tone seems genuine. Buy there's $72M of people's money missing. I'm hopeful there is some creative or unexpected solution Bitfinex will announce. But if you let "unhacked" people flee with their money, there will of course be a lawsuit in which everyone else finds a way to legally hang the hack liability on BF (maybe BitGo too?). (Because it's completely reasonable to argue that, either through constructing ownership of the wallet based on possession of keys, claiming negligence in stewardship, etc etc.) Of course, it will be pennies on the dollar for those poor folks and shutters for Bitfinex. :/
@_date: 2016-08-04 01:27:32
Poorly written. Nvm. Deleted.
But at first I was hopeful from your tone BF would have a plan to deal with this. But your posts seem to be leaking information that the BF "position" will be that *users* lost their individual assets. IMHO, that leads to your certain destruction through one of several possible legal arguments (failure to deliver the asset, constructing ownership of the wallet based on possession of keys, negligence in stewardship, etc etc) but it will be too little too late for the affected "individuals" if that's the route this goes. On the bright side, I guess Bitfinex can claim they weren't hacked, just ~100K "individuals" were. I hope I'm wrong and the announcement contains better news than this.
@_date: 2016-08-03 13:14:14
And in general ballpark terms, what percent of Bitfinex's bitcoin holdings were stolen? I.e, the 120K bitcion is what percent of the total on the platform?
@_date: 2016-08-04 12:55:21
And it's a very relevant question if they are, in fact, insolvent!
@_date: 2016-08-03 17:48:10
Thanks. And approximately what percent of Bitfinex's bitcoin holdings were stolen, in general ballpark terms? I.e, the 120K bitcoin is what percent of the total on the platform?
@_date: 2016-08-04 01:59:59
I don't envy you, and appreciate your energy here for sure! 
As someone who probably sent you messages perceived as "angry," I want to say I was honestly just trying to share some feedback on outcomes of *possible* scenarios. Hopefully the bigwigs making the decisions already have the same input, but if not, my hope by posting is to ferry that feedback up the chain. I'm sure that's delusions of grandeur on my part. Ha ha. But hey, it's all I can do in this moment. It's true that if you aren't personally very informed of the nuances of what this entails, throwing around partial or imprecise answers could start to get people (like me) worried that this is going to be handled badly.
Cheers, mate.
@_date: 2016-08-04 12:59:57
The bailment is the key question, I agree.
But in the case it looks like BF will start allowing withdrawals before announcing a plan to restore losses, I'm pretty sure you will see injunctions filed in an instant by one or more large victims to prevent a "run."
@_date: 2016-08-03 23:32:39
Of course, one can write whatever they want in a TOS, but whether it is legal is another question. Of course, worst case scenario, if everyone who can runs off with their funds and Bitfinex is left penniless, there will be no assets to distribute to the unlucky "individual" victims.
If this is how Bitfinex is going to play this, well, it seems shitty. They don't give you a key to your wallet, they manage it for you, but then tell you it's your personal wallet and they were just the "agent."
@_date: 2016-08-04 01:32:48
I'm being careful to say *if* any time I say that, and outline what I foresee ensuing, assuming no one obtains an injunction before that. But I will say, the statements (including that you don't know what you'll do) are suggesting that is quite *feasible*. I'll wait for your announcement. :)
@_date: 2016-08-03 23:22:46
@_date: 2016-08-16 00:05:40
I'm sure it's fine.
@_date: 2016-08-04 02:04:29
Are you making a moral argument perhaps?
In any case, it's not a legal one. This is banking, money exchange, and/or off-exchange commodities trading (TBD in the courts). There are specific laws and they don't apply to the analogy of house robberies.
@_date: 2016-08-04 00:04:15
Why not? To get some idea of the magnitude to operations.
@_date: 2016-08-04 01:53:23
Good counterpoint. Thanks. I will respond with my thoughts...
First, it's true we have to speculate on the scope of attack because BF has evaded stating it. That should make one expect it's quite possibly not just a small minority of affected BTC assets/users.
Second, if "hacked individuals" with large losses get wind of a possible "run" being allowed to take place, there will be injunctions filed to prevent withdrawals of any assets before you can blink.
@_date: 2016-08-04 00:20:59
Maybe it depends on the scope of loss... 
@_date: 2016-08-04 02:14:42
Yikes. If it's half of BTC, this is not ending any way but horrible.
I'll pray for peace as well, but it might be wise to stockpile water.
And for the record, I am eager to hear the plan and hope there is something creative I'm not foreseeing. But the "legal theory" that Bitfinex wasn't robbed of 120K BTC, just ~60K of its individual users were wiped out at an average of 2 BTC each let's say... well I just don't see that working out. Again that's *if* that's the route we see come out of this. There will be some whales in that group with the legal resources to make sure it doesn't go that way.
@_date: 2016-08-04 12:57:01
90% is nearly all! Did you mistype something? Anyway, sounds like a S.W.A.G. Would love to hear from Bitfinex on this.
@_date: 2016-08-03 17:37:35
Can you help here?

@_date: 2016-08-04 23:08:53
Yep. But it sure affects any haircut rate!
@_date: 2016-08-04 00:17:25
I agree completely (except it's Hong Kong). If they are planning to claim individuals "owned" the wallets that were in their custody, that is super unfair. They should collectivize losses and everyone gets a haircut. That's way fairer than individuals being wiped out versus unharmed based on luck. I agree with you, that someone with lots of money should be (probably is) getting an injunction to prevent irreversible harm. But maybe that doesn't start until the balances are revealed but before withdrawals are allowed? 
@_date: 2015-09-10 14:06:46
And interestingly, there has just been a *huge* uptick in the number of unconfirmed transactions with minimal fees (&lt;10 satoshis per byte)
@_date: 2015-09-10 10:26:16
@_date: 2015-09-10 13:45:35
Watching cointape.com, the estimated delay for free transactions has shot up from 10 blocks to over 100 in the last couple hours. Seems like this is starting to have an effect on the network.
