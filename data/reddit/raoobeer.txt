BTC has more market depth and liquidity than all other coins/tokens combined:
There's a scarce 17.4m coins (BTC) that have dominant liquidity, that can be used to move hundreds of millions without too much slippage.

If you search "Mises deflation", there are several articles about the anti-deflation propaganda.  Here's a quote from one:

Andreas:  
*Bitcoin experts argue that deflation is not bad per se. Rather, deflation is associated with a collapse in demand because that is the only example of deflation we have to study.*
  
Joe:  
*Whoa, I never thought about that..............have you ever done DMT?*

Bitcoin community needs to rally for bypassing these exchanges and trading peer to peer with cash.
Don't listen to the the fear mongers who suggest you will be stabbed or arrested if you trade with cash.
99.5% of cash trades are smooth and successful, just like the weed market has been trading for decades.
