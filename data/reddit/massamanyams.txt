Why does the domain have privacy protection on its whois data? Who are you trying to hide from? Transparency would have made you look much more trustworthy..

The case is real. We don't currently have any information linking the case to the OP, however.

I just signed up to take a look at your emails. Glancing at the welcome message, is there a reason it's base-64 encoded? That's potentially going to look suspicious to some ISPs.
Do you have a dedicated IP with Mailgun?

Well, we can't quite assume that 100% of transactions with those characteristics are going to represent stolen coins - if a scammer generated a duplicate transaction, they still had to contact Gox and request the transaction be resent. 
We can probably look for other transactions to the same address from Gox for the same amount to the same receiving address, but there is of course the chance that some of the duplicate/scam transactions were sent to different addresses.
But this seems worth trying, at least. Wonder why nobody's given it a shot yet?

TXT records are standard and universally accepted for SPF. Next to nobody actually uses the "SPF" record type in DNS.

From the article, another proposed FTT was... 0.03%. I can't imagine that meaningfully affecting anyone other than HFT firms with fraction of a percent margins on most trades.
Most long-term individual investors are already paying way more than that on trading fees alone.
Frankly - if you lost $10k on a stock, you may lose more than 0.03% when unloading it due to slippage, depending on liquidity for the instrument you're trying to sell.

It is to make the distinction between blockchain transactions and Coinbase internal transactions, which have never involved network transaction fees.

Do that, and if you're feeling more advanced implement an Optimal Growth Strategy based on the Kelly Criterion. If you're not a die-hard, never-sell hodler, of course.
