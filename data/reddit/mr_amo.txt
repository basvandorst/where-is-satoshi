I am so pissed about people who can't take worrying news without saying "FUD FUD FUD FUD FUD" That's such an immature and stupid attitude...
Saying that preemptively because I am fu***ng afraid that a price drop might occur today. Today is D-Day or judgement day for BTC and Alts. Source below:
Bitcoin price: Will G20 regulation kill cryptocurrencies? Traders warned of price drops
He said: “Carney’s comments come as a welcome antidote to some of the more alarmist statements on cryptocurrencies that have made headlines in recent weeks.
“Though we are broadly supportive of a potential regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies, the reality is this is a misunderstood industry and is still in the very early stages of its development.
“We hope this common sense approach sets the tone for the rest of the G20 summit this week, to ensure we don’t scupper the potential of this huge wave of technological development.
G20 chiefs are expected to focus their attention on concerns of crypto money laundering and how to protect consumers’ best interests.”

Your title IS TOTALLY MISLEADING!
Stop spreading false news please.
One lobbyist just told that he does not support cryptocurrency regulation. This does not mean that G20 will not pave the way to more regulation.
Actually several countries (France, USA, Germany,...) will actually push for implementing tougher crypto regulation.
So, again, please be more fact-driven and cut this propaganda because, after reading your title, people will get disappointed when they see the probable dip following the G20 announcements (that will unfortunately/likely generate more stringent regulations)...

I read your post carefully, yeah.
Please check the whole picture and refer to the expected crackdown to come and FRA/US/GER's hostility to cryptos.
Then let's see the outcome of the G20.
Again, the statement of this guy (that you probably did not know prior to this article, just like me) will be considered as fake news by markets after the expected final joint statement. This guy expresses the wish of the financial sector, but is role is purely consultative, he is not making any decision.

Of course, Carney is a perfectly unbiased person, right?
Try to read between the lines. You'll understand that his statement is purely influential. He is a former banker, bankers hate institutional regulation or any kind of rules that could make a system more stable eventually.
Anyway, please check you own posts too before trusting opinions instead of facts.
Trust me, strict regulations on cryptos will come out of these 2 G20 days. Wait for US/Germany/France's common statement to drastically control and probably tax cryptocurrencies.
This will be very bad news for cryptos in the short term and BTC will be set for another dip. But, in the long run, cryptos will benefit from extra regulation.

Stop this stupid propaganda... Your title is MISLEADING and what you share is pure fake news. Cut the misinformation.
