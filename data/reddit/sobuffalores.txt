The President invokes the 14th amendment—which dictates that the “validity of the public debt of the United States … shall not be questioned”—to unilaterally raise the debt ceiling.
This is why the whole debt ceiling thing is nonsense.  We legally cannot default on debt.  And, prior to any "funny tricks" to pay bills, the POTUS will act unilaterally to uphold the constitution.  It's happened in the past with other issues, and it'll happen again.  And, the GOP knows this.

You do know that the USD is nothing more than credit notes on the US treasury, right?

A debt limit isn't the same thing as guaranteed to pay, which determines creditworthiness.
If I have a credit limit of $50,000; even if I come close to maxing my credit card, that doesn't mean I'm going to default on it's terms.

It means that you will have your debt paid, if it's owed by the United States.
The US has never defaulted on it's debt, since 1778.

The US dollar isn't backed by the stock market.  It's backed by the full faith and credit of the US, which has been around, and paying its debt since 1778.

At which point, why not just be paid in the stable currency, and then convert it to BTC yourself?

The vast majority of our budget goes towards military spending...  Hitting a debt limit means we could slash our defense budget by ~75%, and still spend just as much on defense as China does.  And, we'd have a balanced budget.
But, it still means we just need a balanced budget, not that we'd default on terms.

Again, you've bested the brightest minds in economics...  I suppose there's a reason you're a futile rebel...
Why don't you fill us in on how well BTC's are doing again?
@_date: 2015-05-04 17:17:13
All I can say to you, is if you think there's no legal obligation or value involved, you must have bested the brightest minds in economic theory alive today and ever have lived.

You can start here: 
Each $1US means you have lent the Federal Reserve $1 worth of value.  It's a credit note, stating how much the Federal Reserve owes you.
It was a huge leap forward from the days of yore, when each bank wrote their own credit notes, which were used for currency.
Think of each bill as a check, written on the bank account belonging to the United States.  And, every single check you cash WILL BE PAID, no matter what.  THIS is what gives the USD value.

Not only the public!  They've tricked every government on the planet!  It's why the USD is the world reserve currency.

Firstly, you have to ensure that the value of the BTC won't drop substantially between contract signing time, and payment time.
That would be the first step.

I'm sorry, I didn't realize this was a private subreddit...

One is a note backed by a stable, and reputable group.  The other is based on hopes and dreams of a bunch of crypto-aficionados.

Because bitcoin is going to the moon! /sarcasm
Deflation is good, because of this:
Or something.

Trends brah.  Trends.

Apparently, deflation is bad with bitcoin too:

I would have done the same thing...
