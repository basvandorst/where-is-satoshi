It's a good thing cryptocurrency are not stocks am I right guys? :^)

Traitor! HODL!

HODL HODL HODL

Don't do it and stop being lazy. Do research yourself, use google and youtube. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:12:12
Fuck off
@_date: 2017-12-17 15:49:14
Retard. Why don't you just give them your visa? Might as well.

Man fuck off

I only hear bad things about kraken. Gdax does the job very well.
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:58:04
Pull out the amount you invested = win win...
@_date: 2017-12-09 22:29:17
I invested 740 euros 2 weeks ago and made 300 euros in a month, now it crashed but hey, keep hodling.

Well I was just hinting for you to remove your post... Don't blame me for your retardation.
@_date: 2017-12-11 10:45:32
Futures are a good thing :)
@_date: 2017-12-03 17:23:56
Wait untill there's a small dip. It will happen at this current rate.
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:40:23
Hey! :D
@_date: 2017-12-03 11:28:36
Great idea to invest first and do the research later man, keep that mindset for the rest of your life :)
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:25:33
Did you read the first sentence of the above post? Look up "paper wallet" on google. Jezus how old are you? Do I need to hold your hand?
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:50:50
Use gdax (it’s from coinbase). Do bank transfer to gdax and you won’t pay any fees.
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:54:15
You are very correct in saying you have a limited knowledge of bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-05 17:01:41
"I have little knowledge in BTC" Sums up your post.
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:52:55
Well if you follow the trend it always has been rising. And with the increasing popularity of it, chances of bitcoin suddenly crashing seems pretty low. Yes. Invest and hodl your coins even if there seem to be a "crash" (it's probably not going to be a crash, just a dip/stabilising of the price)
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:08:21
Well you can just look at the email address it's coming from.
@_date: 2017-12-02 21:09:28
Yes you would be the biggest fucking retard alive.

Why do people feel the need to have a whole bitcoin?

Dude something's fishy and this is not even funny anymore. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:27:38
Can't be a dip if it's a rise dumbass.
@_date: 2017-12-17 16:08:19
You are right but our hope is that some day things will change. But yes, as of right now, you are right.
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:40:12
@_date: 2017-12-03 17:05:05
Thing is GDAX is from Coinbase...
@_date: 2017-12-18 21:27:16
This is why you're better off with a paper wallet :) 
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:54:42
What a dumb question. Who says bitcoin is still going to rise in 2020? Why wouldn’t it crash or be at the price it is now? You don’t know, you can’t know. So your question is obsolete.
@_date: 2017-12-09 22:38:31
Yeah I bought before it hit 10K and I kept hodling xD
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:09:05
There seems to be more activity on the exchanges on fridays, although I’ve also seen crazy fluctuations on other weekdays or even in the weekend.
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:31:21
from wiki: 
Fiat money has been defined variously as:
Any money declared by a government to be legal tender.[4]
State-issued money which is neither convertible by law to any other thing, nor fixed in value in terms of any objective standard.[5]
Intrinsically valueless money used as money because of government decree.[2]
@_date: 2017-12-18 21:30:00
I see thanks!
@_date: 2017-12-04 17:56:31
Yeah because it's so common for companies to accept bitcoin right? 
Go kys.
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:39:47
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:51:02
Tbh even a paper wallet is better than a hardware wallet. Virusses and malware can't do anything to paper.
@_date: 2017-12-06 10:55:33
Gdax is really solid and no fees.
@_date: 2017-12-03 09:08:34
Well let’s hope they won’t sell all their bitcoins at once then
@_date: 2017-12-03 17:08:20
Yes I've done it, got it within 28 hours. (also Belgium)
@_date: 2017-12-01 17:54:34
You can use gdax and do a wire transfer, no fees there.
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:54:38
The thing with day-trading BTC is that even if you do fuck up and buy on high, eventually it'll rise and you'll make a profit. God I love bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-17 10:33:02
Futures have been released since the 10th.
@_date: 2017-12-18 18:21:41
Don't do it kid.
@_date: 2017-12-01 13:36:16
Fuck off and die
@_date: 2017-12-06 19:24:24
So you just wire money from your bank account directly to gdax and there's no fee. Same with depositing back from gdax to your bank account.
@_date: 2017-12-18 21:25:13
Jezus stop crying. Coinbase didn't steal from you.
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:47:02
What kind of obscure exchange do you use then?
@_date: 2017-12-13 12:55:08
Yeah man I feel you. I mean it's so mainstream that I can just pay my bills and my groceries with BTC, damn.
@_date: 2017-12-04 02:18:05
That seems optimistic but let’s hope! I think it’s gonna be around 17k.
@_date: 2017-12-03 11:23:18
Yes you're too late, go kys.
@_date: 2017-12-17 16:53:54
Yeah man BTC is dead, you can leave this subreddit now.
(no it's not dead)
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:35:12
Fuck off mate
@_date: 2017-12-17 11:27:53
Whei, go cry us a river.
@_date: 2017-12-18 21:17:13
So the only downside of not using SegWit wallets is that fees are more expensive? 
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:55:27
Fuck off mate
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:43:11
That's a distance retard.
@_date: 2017-12-17 12:24:47
Thanks for your amazing input.
@_date: 2017-12-01 12:37:39
Fucking love that movie
@_date: 2017-12-03 17:26:44
The thing is: Yes it will probably rise and buying now wouldn't hurt. But just to be sure and to play it safe, buy when people are panic selling. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 21:26:28
I feel sad that I wasn't there...
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:41:18

@_date: 2017-12-03 17:10:36
more than $2
@_date: 2017-12-03 11:30:13
It would be the ideal time to buy a lot of BTC :)
@_date: 2017-12-15 22:26:22
I liked the part where you first bought and then asked questions. Did you do the same for bitcoin? But first, then ask what it actually was? Good job man :)
@_date: 2017-12-04 18:36:46
What a time to be alive right? :D
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:41:36
Yup, sadly that’s not possible.
@_date: 2017-12-05 16:59:22
Everything is relative, so this question is retarded.
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:13:53
Can you atleast correct it in your post so that people won’t think you’re trolling?
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:06:37
A fair amount that I’m willing to lose if things go south
@_date: 2017-12-17 16:04:36
@_date: 2017-12-03 17:19:37
It took me 28 hours and I live in Europe...
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:43:06
Just use GDAX. And no it hasn't been hacked as far as I know.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:11:26
You're late to the party man.
@_date: 2017-12-03 17:22:11
I disagree. Rises like this are bound to create a dip sooner or later. Buy then. I wouldn't buy now.
@_date: 2017-12-05 17:17:24
Good thing Moore's law is not even correct. Please keep doing your amazing research and you'll get there eventually.
@_date: 2017-12-04 21:45:44
Same. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 08:43:04
Yes it’s big scam. Big scary scam. 
Now go away.
(You’re not made for this)
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:46:38
@_date: 2017-12-05 16:57:45
This is probably the best option. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:37:27
You can always kys.
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:20:30
We didn't break 10K on gdax... 
@_date: 2017-12-03 11:21:48
buy now, it still rises every day... Right now it's quite stable but still rising slowly :)
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:29:29
No it's about futures.
@_date: 2017-12-18 18:42:29
Oh my sweet summer child...
@_date: 2017-12-08 13:48:22
You assume a lot

@_date: 2017-12-14 14:46:35
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:33:20
Looks pretty clear to me.
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:09:28
Why are you stressing out bro? I mean you only put in what you could afford to lose right? ;)
@_date: 2017-12-17 16:46:50
I agree, but that time isn't now and it will not be for some time. However I do believe in the future of BTC.
@_date: 2017-12-15 17:36:52
If you do everything offline there's no harm.
@_date: 2017-12-03 17:16:25

Since when is Blender for video editing? I thought it was used for 3D modelling?
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:19:23
A lot of people buy, price goes up.
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:38:08
Cause Kraken is shit and you only hear bad things from them.
@_date: 2017-12-15 08:26:43
Kys /s
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:04:23
You call this calm? More like the storm before the hurricane.
@_date: 2017-12-04 17:32:13
Yeah everyone knows, thanks.
@_date: 2017-12-03 12:23:23
Just use an exchange. I use gdax and there are no fees when doing limit orders. Amazing.
@_date: 2017-12-11 10:40:10
Thanks, now go kys.
@_date: 2017-12-03 14:49:49
get rekt
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:59:15
No, it’s inevitable. This is not sustainable. I love the price rises as much as anyone else but it will crash at some point (by crash I mean more than just “dip”).
But... I do believe that after the crash the price will just go back up again and go even higher. This is just a warning to everyone who don’t expect a price crash. These people will probably panic and sell their btc. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 11:19:23
Yes, look up "paper wallet" on google. It's a paper copy of your public and private key so only you can acces it. You can print out multiple copies of them in case you lose one. Put one in a safe, keep 'em in different places, ...
@_date: 2017-12-18 21:21:06
Calling it a scam is ridiculous. Calling it a bubble.. Well we call everything a bubble.
@_date: 2017-12-04 17:28:22
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:37:32
Yeah but it are 2 different and seperate markets
@_date: 2017-12-08 10:45:34
Paper wallet, multiple copies
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:55:33
... yes, that's the point I'm making, thanks for making it obvious.
@_date: 2017-12-18 18:46:31
YAY!! Arbitrary milestone whoo!
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:15:49
Hodl untill you're dead.
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:46:47
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:36:09
Just in general, I'm from Europe and I prefer gdax over any exchange by far.
@_date: 2017-12-17 15:45:31
Yeah fuck money but I'd rather have some than having none. Do not spend money on BTC that you can afford to lose. Seeing BTC as a way to "get rich quick" is not going to get you far.
@_date: 2017-12-06 19:20:33
Now let us all prepare for a dip, aka HODL.
@_date: 2017-12-04 17:12:32
Fucking kys traitor!
@_date: 2017-12-04 17:27:18
Pretty drastic measure buddy.
@_date: 2017-12-15 08:58:11
You are right and everyone who says otherwise is a fanboy of BTC, not thinking rationally.
Personally I have bought some BTC with money I’m preparing to lose. I always loved the idea of BTC and I still think it has a lot of future potential. It just needs a lot more time and indeed as of right now it’s not really handy or useful to use IMO. However I think if it gets adopted more worldwide, the benefits will start to grow too. 
Thanks for the good post OP.
@_date: 2017-12-14 14:44:22
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:02:44
You bet this isn't normal, I'm not liking this one bit. Whatever happens I'll keep hodling though.
@_date: 2017-12-18 21:13:09
Hidden in plain sight :^) 
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:06:04
Yes i’m sure of that too but that doesn’t mean price crashes aren’t going to happen.
@_date: 2017-12-17 10:46:00
Oh nice what's the difference?
@_date: 2017-12-01 17:38:45
Talking about adoption... Are you adopted?
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:12:00
Thousands, easily.
@_date: 2017-12-03 13:38:15
After every strong rise like today comes a dip.
@_date: 2017-12-05 17:22:29
Moore's law is a thing for the past with our current tech and has been for some years now.
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:24:49

@_date: 2017-12-18 21:24:04
"Free electricity" LOL
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:10:08
This is the best and most simple explanation I've seen so far.
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:10:37
So if I printed out a piece of paper that would represent BTC it would make it real? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:13:54
You do know that mining for diamonds or gold is not as evident as mining bitcoins from your own computer, right?
@_date: 2017-12-18 10:01:17
Cme futures have been released, maybe that’s why
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:59:01
