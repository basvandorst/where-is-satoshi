Well, I'm interpreting his tweet.  But so are you.  You don't know what he knows.  So we don't know who is misinterpreting.

What makes you so sure that Andreas doesn't know exactly who the real Satoshi is?

Well, he calls himself "Executive Director of Bitcoin Foundation."  Obviously the mistake indicates a major misunderstanding, but technically they were just one word off.

Has he made it clear that he doesn't know who "the real Satoshi" is, or has he decided that the best way to keep him anonymous is to plead ignorance?  You're suggesting that you have proof that this is not the real Satoshi and you're suggesting that you implicitly believe Andresen.  You're willfully ignoring that he might be pleading ignorance in order to preserve Satoshi's anonymity.
For the record, I don't think Satoshi should be doxxed if he doesn't want to be so that is not what this is about.

You're right -- you probably can't prove anything on this.
Here is the problem: "Mr. Nakamoto" (the real founder of Bitcoin) apparently does not want to be found/identified.  So here are some possibilities:
The guy in the Newsweek story is not the founder of Bitcoin.  The only way to really prove that would be to say "here is the real founder of Bitcoin."  But if he doesn't want to be identified, then we presumably won't get that kind of proof.
The guy in the Newsweek story is the founder of Bitcoin.  He reluctantly admitted to it in the interview and then he decided after the interview to say that it is not him.
I find it potentially telling that Gavin Andresen, current lead developer of the Bitcoin Project, said that he regrets the doxxing of Nakamoto: 
Although we can't be sure, let's presume that Gavin Andresen knows who the real Nakamoto is if he said this.  If he does know the real Nakamoto, then this could be an admission that Newsweek found the right guy.  Or, maybe he really doesn't know who Nakamoto is, in which case maybe he assumed that Newsweek got the right guy even though they didn't.

I'm not asking for negative proofs.  I'm saying that you can't have negative proofs, so why is everyone here automatically believing this is the real Nakamoto denying that he talked to Newsweek?  The vibe here is clearly that this post confirms that they got the wrong guy, which is ridiculous.
I know how to think critically just fine.  You've got your head fixed on your fascination with basic logical fallacies that you learned either from Wikipedia or from Philosophy 101.
Speaking of fallacies, you're operating under the confirmation bias.  You want to believe that this link verifies that Newsweek has the wrong guy.  I'm saying that you can't know that.  You don't know what other information Newsweek has.

If you think we're better than them, don't you think that Reddit should wait a bit now now before declaring the Newsweek story a sham?

Of course the onus is on them. But this is hardly proof that it's not him.  Newsweek says that it is standing by its story.  I'm just interested in verified truth -- that's really it.

An asshole, like a lot of rich people.
