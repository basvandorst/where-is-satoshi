I've been watching the Forbes articles for some time now, they are a reactive commentary. Price goes up they talk good; goes down they talk bad. They're just writing for clicks IMO

I have bitpay, but I could probably take direct into a wallet
@_date: 2019-06-18 22:17:32
Hahahaha, I wonder if anyone got that
@_date: 2019-06-15 17:33:57
Like who? I didn't know. And don't know any. And I am an actual dealer. Can you name an auto dealer who accepts Bitcoin? I actually find that exciting, not sure why you seem so glum about it
@_date: 2019-06-04 23:02:48
Right on. Thanks for the explanation.
@_date: 2019-10-26 02:57:14

Someone humor me here, what if he DOES produce the evidence lol
@_date: 2019-06-15 17:13:45
Totally understand that sentiment.
@_date: 2019-06-16 13:34:27
Very very true, but gold doesn't get spent in a store. Bitcoin is supposed to be used that way
@_date: 2019-06-15 16:04:03
I know, I'm new to this so I couldn't find if it posted the first time so I thought the mod deleted it for rule violation so I reposted without manufacturer names. My bad

I'm very curious to see how the whole Tesla model and automated driving pans out for my industry. It could be devastating as an owner, but it could just turn into a different business model. Either way I firmly believe in progress and am excited either way
@_date: 2019-06-16 00:58:20
I don't know what the fungibility is for Bitcoin, but those are very good questions. I can tell you that if it were cash then it is illegal to judge the currency by it's past uses. Not sure about Bitcoin tho, very interesting line of thought
@_date: 2019-06-15 15:23:33
Soooo, you either A.) Don't believe in cars and walk everywhere, or B.) Don't believe in Bitcoin as a currency. Either of which I am confused about.
@_date: 2019-06-16 01:16:55
Bet they have made bank then if they kept it in coin. Bitpay let's you choose to keep part or whole in coin. It's great
@_date: 2019-06-15 17:35:00
Yes! Exactly. Use, save, spend, and save some more.
@_date: 2019-06-15 17:14:50
We are in Alabama, but I would definitely be willing to work you on this! How cool would it be to say we transacted a new vehicle in Bitcoin!!! I'm excited just thinking about it lol
@_date: 2019-06-16 01:21:10
 and  thanks for asking!!
@_date: 2019-06-15 15:44:16
I suppose I understand what you're saying, I just absolutely disagree with it. If you said you hate Ford or Dodge then that would be a fine sentiment. But not spending crypto cause it depreciates? Well, no matter what type currency you would use the product still depreciates. If you say you would spend cash on it then it still depreciates. Credit will  not change that fact either. And if you transfer from crypto to Fiat then you still convert at whatever rate is there at the time of conversion. Either crypto is meant to be used or it's not. And if it's not then how long will it's value last in the decades to come if all it does is get buried or sit on a shelf? 
On another note, would you not spend crypto for a cup of joe or a sandwich cause they don't appreciate in value either? Maybe the BCH guys are right, maybe I should be taking their currency instead ����‍♂️

My logo tho is in the bottom right of the pic too.
@_date: 2019-06-15 18:03:43
Nice. Well, I'm dying to transact in it. Would be super cool to me
@_date: 2019-06-15 17:35:20
Aaaahhhh, I'm so sry lol

Thank you! And again, I'm sry I ruined your joke lol. I went back and re-read it; let's just say I've never been accused of being the smartest in the room ��

My only concern with Bitcoin is the whole "hodl" thing. I understand that holding something that tends to appraise in value is wise but the whole point of money is to transact. I fear that if people don't actually use it then it will lose it's worth someday. Obviously I have no real expertise in the matter, but it has crossed my mind alot lately
@_date: 2019-06-15 22:23:33
Dude sooo true. I was in the auto business when websites first came out and I laugh at how awkward people in my business handled it. Now it's an absolute staple of industry. God you brought back some memories lol
@_date: 2019-06-18 00:36:08
Would you mind explaining your breakdown? Money invested, number of coins mined per month, etc. I asked about mining in the past and investing 30k to do so and all I got was a bunch of nays
@_date: 2019-06-18 02:38:12
How are you getting the 5.7c electricity?
@_date: 2019-06-15 22:27:11
It's a dollar. But instead of being valued by a government it is valued by demand, like gold and silver.
