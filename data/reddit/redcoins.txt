One day all the above services will become history.
We are so lucky that we can use bitcoin instead.:)
@_date: 2015-06-04 16:30:14
Remember it's not the first time the block reward gets halved. I think the market will re-adjust on its own. Difficulty may also be adjusted if some miners really go away.
@_date: 2015-06-25 05:49:42
I just wish I could go back to 2013 :)
@_date: 2015-06-26 03:22:50
So, what the Ditch government want to do with Bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-11-18 17:02:49
Good point, but you not only need car key but also legal documents to prove you own a car. In bitcoin world, private key is the only way to prove your own a btc address.

Nice 10 bits @_date: 2014-11-21 02:52:11
Don't want to argue if the data is 100% accurate or not. I can feel the uptrend anyway. Congrats for everyone participating in this new ChangeTip world :)
@_date: 2014-11-28 15:18:03
Yes it's safer but please make sure you disable SSL3 in your browser due to the Poodle vulnerability.
@_date: 2014-11-19 17:18:19
No worries guys. 
Normally when everyone expects a Black Friday to come, it just won't come :)
@_date: 2014-12-18 06:53:59
This is indeed a great news for Phils people. Easy send and withdrawal are the keys to bring more people into bitcoin world.
@_date: 2014-11-17 14:16:07
Not sure coz I'm new to changetip and bitcoin. I have just created a new changetip account today and received my first tip. Still learning how to use it, but I do like the idea of changetip very much.

I hope you enjoy your holiday too. 
Have fun and merry Christmas!
@_date: 2014-11-17 14:28:18
Why so excited? I think bitcoin price is still very cheap now
@_date: 2014-11-26 07:12:48
Good points :)
For the 2 features you are suggesting, I'd suggest you post here: 
@_date: 2014-11-20 01:59:35
Very funny… I like it: ) "Some people actually think they are worth something", well said!
@_date: 2014-12-14 13:49:44
Easy. When USD starts to drop again, then Bitcoin price will rise for sure.
@_date: 2014-11-19 17:04:23
Don't panic.
Gold price has rebounded a bit and is already stronger than I expected. 
You'd feel more painful if you did invest in the crude oil instead.
@_date: 2014-11-17 14:47:34
I hope bitcoin could handle it but I'm afraid it can't do anything about relativistic effects. Theory of relativity is just having too little direct relation with bitcoin :)
@_date: 2014-11-21 02:45:01
OTC means Over-The-Counter, which refers to off-exchange trading directly between 2 parties
@_date: 2014-11-18 12:11:28
Teacher: whoever answers my next question, can go home.
One boy throws his bag out the window.
Teacher: who just threw that?!
Boy: Me! I’m going home now.
@_date: 2015-05-15 04:13:02
Sad to hear this. I originally thought this app was not that bad.
@_date: 2014-11-19 02:27:14
Great for your girlfriend ;) Bitcoin is really an idea payment method for things like groceries. Keep using it!
@_date: 2014-11-19 10:05:36
It doesn't matter how old you are but you better stay away from Bitcoin if you also believe that your brain is still undeveloped
@_date: 2014-11-19 14:06:34
Physical bitcoins should be far less than 21 million. People who think that rare things are valuable may want to own some physical bitcoins. As there is a demand, then there is a supply.
@_date: 2014-11-19 07:37:53
Can anyone tell why I can't receive anything? Is it because my changetip account is too new or what? Just don't understand
@_date: 2015-05-01 07:22:44
I never generate private keys online, no matter how safe a website seems to be.
Just generate offine using Bitcoin core and they should be safe enough for normal uses. :)
@_date: 2015-05-27 15:13:29
For low amount, it should be fine...  But since it won't take too long for one confirmation, so better just wait for one. :)
@_date: 2015-01-02 04:27:12
Why it takes so long for Tokyo polite to know this?
@_date: 2015-01-14 03:37:19
Suggest you try tipping $0.1 to 10,000 people to see the result :)
@_date: 2015-01-17 13:26:47
In various places?? I think you better use it only on your own virus-free computer
@_date: 2015-01-20 09:39:46
Happy Tuesday everyone :) 
Have a nice day!
@_date: 2015-01-13 05:57:18
Why you post here if you don't like Bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-01-20 09:51:18
I like this idea. It does help bring more new people to know about Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-01-28 03:00:51
Trezor if you don't mind to pay. Otherwise a paper wallet is good enough.
@_date: 2015-01-05 11:43:10
Bitstamp needs to disclose more. We still don't know how many coins are stolen yet :(
@_date: 2015-01-07 04:31:57
They also need to make btc easier to spend, especially for those non-tech girls.
@_date: 2015-05-17 06:01:04
For understanding Bitcoin core code, you'll need to know C++ language.
For developing other Bitcoin apps, you're not limited only to C++ and you'll need to know the programming languages the apps should be developed from.
@_date: 2014-12-25 07:46:57
Merry Xmas :)
@_date: 2015-07-09 13:44:18
I think most but not all newbies who don't fully understand what happened should wait for 30 confirmations. Just to play safe. ;)
@_date: 2015-07-07 10:00:51
10 mins is normal for Bitcoin. Sometimes it can be even longer but that's fine. :)
@_date: 2015-04-05 16:04:34
Nice! And battery-powered only. I wish I could get one on Easter too.
@_date: 2015-04-20 07:36:23
Great efforts! But it seems it still can't prevent voters to vote more than once, right?
@_date: 2015-04-18 16:47:00
It is very easy to check with blockchain.info. Just check the transaction inputs and you will see where they came from.
@_date: 2015-04-23 06:27:50
Nice contest. Will possibly give it a try :)
@_date: 2015-04-21 04:41:08
If everybody does the same, Bitcoin will hit mass adoption very very soon :)
@_date: 2015-04-08 02:49:36
I think it should be a bit faster. I could be wrong.
@_date: 2015-04-02 06:24:06
Dump your private key. Move it to another wallet such as MultiBit to spend your fund.
@_date: 2015-04-24 07:07:54
Yes the ecosystem is stronger than it was 2 years ago, coz there are more and more new applications of BTC.
But I just doubt if the pump and dump era has really ended.
@_date: 2015-03-02 08:19:03
I'd be interested to know if any of the double spend attempts from Multimine would ever succeed.
@_date: 2015-03-13 16:41:52
Agree. Let's pass it on to the next generation!
@_date: 2015-03-09 18:09:10
If an altcoin can succeed, it just means that more people will enter the crypto world. Bitcoin should benefit from it too.
I don't see any reason to jump ship by then.
@_date: 2015-03-03 17:08:40
Congrats! Nice to see a Canadian exchange growing :)
@_date: 2015-02-07 17:19:23
Nice reporting. Glad to know you have a fairly good experience on your first Bitcoin purchase :)
@_date: 2015-02-07 14:26:15
Come here everyone!  
I like your style. :)
@_date: 2015-02-06 07:49:48
San Francisco... I love this place :)
@_date: 2015-02-08 21:58:32
Sad to hear that. :(  Another mtgox?
@_date: 2015-02-16 09:42:59
Is it possible to release a light-weight version that only downloads block headers?
If so, we won't need other third-party SPV clients anymore.
@_date: 2015-02-05 15:52:55
Use Google Adsense, or publish a paid version of your app.
@_date: 2015-02-11 11:53:24
Make a paper wallet, then put it inside a safe deposit box of a bank you trust.
@_date: 2015-02-12 12:07:41
Cool idea! 
I hope the Bitcoins we mine will soon be enough to fully pay the electricity bills. :)
@_date: 2015-02-21 12:47:52
Sure, if it is not too complicated to make the code work. You can show me how to get it done? :)
@_date: 2015-02-07 14:31:34
Good points. 
We should still explain about the bitcoin protocol after people get interested in it.
