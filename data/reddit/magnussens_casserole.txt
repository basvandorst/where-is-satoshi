I think any inherently deflationary currency has been conclusively proven a hoarder's paradise, and hoarders kill economies. Money exists to be exchanged, not held, otherwise it isn't worth a good god damn.
The reason central banks ensure slow, steady inflation is because it guarantees pressure is put on people who have money to reinvest to actually, you know, *invest*.
That's without even getting into the massive problems caused by the Zimbabwe-level instability of the Bitcoin market. You'd be a fool to believe the unbelievable value swings that have emerged in the last couple of years are anything but deliberate market manipulation by wealthy speculators.

The directly negative consequences of an uncontrolled commodity-based currency were exhaustively explored throughout the 18th and 19th centuries. We dumped it for fiat currency in the 1960s for a reason: commodity currencies are *inherently unable* to keep up with a growing non-material economy. You can print paper, you *cannot* print gold. With a currency like Bitcoin, you literally run out of money because there's no way to produce more of it, leading to deflationary spirals that crush economies through constrained growth.

The price of Bitcoin would skyrocket due to extremely limited supply and turn it into a speculative instrument and the entire network would totally fail under the load of trying to process thousands of transactions per second.
There are cryptocoins that show genuine promise as eventual real currencies, like Monero, but Bitcoin has way too many 1.0 iteration flaws hard-coded into the system. Last time I tried to use it to actually buy shit was when it traded at &lt;$300 and I was in college getting acid from Agora. Even then it was a pain in the ass to use and showing its limitations.
Still, gotta say I wish I'd kept a couple of the Bitcoins I mined in 2011 instead of buying weed with 'em.

At which point it becomes an inherently deflationary currency that no sane person would try to run a market economy on.
Bitcoin will never be anything better than digital gold.

INFLATION BAD, DEFLATION GOOD
Never-you-mind that deflation totally obliterates investment...
