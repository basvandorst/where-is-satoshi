That's the fee to transact on bitcoin network. Not exodus fault

There are no personnal attack in anything that I said. I would be happy to be proven wrong

Running your own LN node won't change zip unless you have tremendous liquidity. And yes you will need permission to use big nodes (useful nodes). Some providers already announced it (the ceo of Satoshi portal which will likely be hosting the biggest Canadian node already announced that he won't let us citizen use it.)

OMG A CONCERN TROLL :( /S

1000 BTC and some good engineers full time for a couple months :). One of my friends from where I live has that and will become a very powerful man. Handful of ppl will have nodes they are very lucky

We have the same dreams ��

He's most likely on BCH side

Please don't stuff the blockchain with pointless 0.02 transactions
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:59:28
Congrats. You can now pay rent to your diverse local authorities

He didn't. stop misleading people about this app 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:56:44
I downvoted you and I'm not a shill. Random holder from 4 years ago. I don't think this is an attack. This is markets speaking
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:48:28
I hate the fact that I will have to ask a third party's permission to transact. Also they will be subject to aml and kyc. So basically international low fee transactions will be impossible. Bitcoin will never be the same!! Some of our rights as bitcoiners have been taken away from us! 
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:10:08
You can see these correlation with everything 
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:39:42
all of you cuck twats always wanted COINBASE to support BCH so it could get dumped!!! be careful what you wish for
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:20:34
You are delusional. There will be third parties selling side chains services (blockstream being one of them you can't argue this fact) and they will be subject to KYC. one of the biggest Canadian bitcoin processing services already announced his LN node won't be Available to US citizen (Satoshi portal) . It won't be permission less at ALL 
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:37:45
So? Would you rather hide these facts from investors? It's true that bitcoin  has became useless as currency 
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:59:11
Nothing special here
@_date: 2017-11-22 21:40:08
And how much man power 
@_date: 2017-11-21 21:22:02
Charge backs from stolen cards is also a "fee" 
@_date: 2017-11-19 16:30:28
I know what it is dw. It's not ready though and won't be for a long time 
@_date: 2017-11-22 22:17:01
No shit. But the baking system requires more man power than bitcoin does 
@_date: 2017-11-25 21:57:49
Real bitcoin is currently trading at under 2000 been staking for a few weeks
@_date: 2017-11-17 02:31:36
that's cool but we are not a coffee coin. :) we are a store of value, like gold

A country where basic auto insurance doesn't cover taxi activities, ie the USA (I work in insurance) 
@_date: 2017-11-22 02:28:52
@_date: 2017-11-20 16:05:08
Because high fees are a **good thing** in the bcore community!
@_date: 2017-11-19 15:48:52
28 cents to send 33$ is almost 1% it's pretty expensive if you wanna kill the dollar and take over the financial system it's gonna take more than that IMO
@_date: 2017-11-19 17:51:41
it's legal but very dangerous for both driver and passenger. If you get into an accident, neither will be covered.

Through subway cards that you can buy in BTC via gyft

Fees. And there will always be bitcoin left to mine as block rewards will halve every 4 years ie never reaching 0. (12.5/2^n will always be greater than 0)
