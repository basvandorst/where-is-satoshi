Casual racism...because? Couldn't have just said 'public sector' like most conservative types like to meme?

Or capitalists. Or Marixsts. Or whatever.
Ideology is ideology and 'currency' as an idea is not exempt from this truth.

All currencies are an abstraction from the real....'cash' and 'gold' are just as capable of collapsing, with that very same attitude no less.

SO maybe you should have said that in your first reply....

Don't tell ME that, lol. in fact, don't tell anyone that - if you dislike it, change it yourself. You have the power to.
We need to move away from this 'complaining' paradigm we as a society have, and move to a 'lets change shit for the better' paradigm that we need as a species.
But that's just my 2 cents.

Read all the data at equal weight, then interpret it yourself. It's not meant to be pretty because they aren't *selling* anything.

My comments weren't about design? You're the ones who keep referring back to that.
@_date: 2013-12-17 16:19:45
That's fine. But *my* point wasn't about typography. or rather, it was about how the point shouldn't be about that unless you're willing to *do* something about it.
But hey, keep thinking you're right.
@_date: 2013-12-20 05:10:34
 By pointing to something you guys are bringing up. :P
Anyways, my point is pretty basic as it is, so there's no need to go in circles like this.

You assume that I struggled. Cute.
People with no expectations are never disappointed
@_date: 2013-12-16 13:10:59
....What? The context in question has nothing to with making money. Why are you bringing that aspect of things up?
@_date: 2013-12-16 11:16:02
Then go ahead and volunteer your time in order to do so.
It's easy to complain.
@_date: 2013-12-16 11:15:03
@_date: 2013-12-16 11:15:21
More or less, this.

lol, well no. I meant it in a very broad sense. This website was posted precisely because it has valuable information. The important thing isn't *them* and their particular version of that information, but in the dissemination of it to the 'people' so that we can become better informed and use it to our advantage [hence the 'spirit' of reddit]. Nothing's stopping someone from taking this information and compiling it into a more efficient form [people do these kinds of things all the time, actually].
@_date: 2013-12-19 08:14:51
You actually are by discussing it now?
@_date: 2013-12-16 11:15:37
Takes me back...oh the memories.
@_date: 2013-12-16 14:06:36
This information isn't be 'sold.'
Red herring is very red. But if you didn't want to engage in a debate, I don't know why you'd respond to me in the first place. Would have been much easier to simply not comment at all.

Users don't have a right to put their money where there mouth is not.
