Are you absolutely insane?  So 90% of your market you want to exclude?

Nobody is asking many questions, just all memes and to the moon posts.
Thanks for posting this, yes not sure what people in the know can give us here.
They certainly haven't tried to quash the rumours and I'm loving how the herd is saying "let them ban it"   Well lets see a 1/4 of the worlds population are not allowed to trade and 80 -90% of trade is in China  it's significant.

People recently are constantly posting Marks, I doubt that most of r/bitcoin will get it.  MArks managed capital for years for many a client and know the market like few others.   But this is not very good for the average 14yo /bitcoin commentor  who made $2k off their last investment, they are more informed than someone who's been looking after peoples money for the last 20 years

It is on r/bitcoin. We won't accept anything less than everything is going up

I've recently done similar with closing a few accounts, incredible either faxes or letters.
To add to the Luddite behaviour of these institutions, I had to change address, that needed written confirmation, ok fair enough however they then sent a letter to my new address saying it's done but.... another letter to my old address saying can we confirm that the change of address was valid.   Luckily residents at my old address forwarded me the mail, if they were sinister people they could have written back to the bank saying no this is invalid and then found ways to get the account closed and the money sent to themselves.
