If you dump 3bn on the market, the price isn’t going up, that’s for sure.

There is a vast difference between market cap (the total value of all the bitcoins) and liquidity. 
If everybody HODLs and liquidity is zero, the price will indeed go to the moon. But if everyone is selling, the price drops to zero. 
You can hold 200.000 BTC, but if no one is buying them, they are worthless. 
Scenario: they start selling, the price drops. People see the price drop and are thus afraid of buying and so on and so on, untill equilibrium is reached.

And that’s the difference between state supported fiat and a bunch of random numbers adored by nerds. The difference between real money and monopoly money. 
And even if it were a real currency, currencies are interchangeable. That’s one of the properties of currencies: they’re interchangeable for goods, they’re interchangeable for other currencies. 
In reality, BTC is an imaginary commodity, like loot boxes and skins. And with commodities, you are made whole, based on the value at the time of the loss. If someone wrecks your car new car in 2010 and it takes 8 years for the courts to decide, you get the value of a new car, not an 8 year old car.

"Never catch a falling knive" is the other side of the coin.

Inflation= stuff gets more expensive, you need more money to buy the same. Deflation = stuff gets cheaper/money becomes more valuable. Case in point: bitcon. If the value is rising, why would you spend your bitcon now? You will be able to buy so much more next year.
As a result, people hold back their consumption, which slows down the economy. It also stops currency from circulating
That is why central banks aim for a bit of inflation. Not too much, just a bit. Currency should ideally be at zero inflation/deflation, but that is hard to maintain, and you definitely don't want deflation. So they err on the side of caution. Currency is a means, not an end in itself. 
As long as Bitcon is deflationary, it fails totally at being a currency.
@_date: 2019-10-23 21:55:49
Uhm, you do know that deflation is a really, rrreaaaally, rrreeeeaaaaally bad property for a currency, right?
@_date: 2019-10-23 21:37:57
“Bitcon is a currency”
Also “I’m not selling”
@_date: 2017-11-03 17:33:31
On the one hand yes, but *any* currency, fiat or digital, relies primarily on the trust that people have in it.  Fiat money is only worth the paper it is printed on, it has value because people *believe* it has value. If that belief is in some way undermined (Mount gox, shitcoins, forks), that value can collapse in an instant. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 10:04:14
That’s putting the horse behind the cart: in my view, the biggest risk to bitcoin right now is the shitcoins and lending platforms. Those will crash, hard, and could take BTC with them. If you look at Bitconnect, these guys hold a vast amount of bitcoin. 
@_date: 2019-12-01 12:53:26
Shit article. A real article links to the source. This one simply links to the site of the german parliament. 
So I’d have my doubts

You never had crypto, you had a promise from mt gox. 
 Don’t own the keys? Don’t own the crypto. 
@_date: 2018-03-08 17:22:29
You have no way of valueing these promises. As the article in OP link says, btc were sold in at least three blocks, each with a different value. 
Which Btc was yours?  Also, you need to treat all equal creditors equally. 
So the correct method of valuating a volatile commodity like BTC is for the judge to decide a cut-off point, and then reimbursing creditors based on the value of that cut-off. 
At least they get their money back. Could have been way worse. 
@_date: 2018-03-08 16:54:51
Remember that those people never owned bitcoin (obligatory: 
They gave fiat to mt gox under the assumption that mt gox would exchange them the value of bitcoin. 
Anyone who has his money on an exchange doesn’t own bitcoin, they own a promise.

Actions by a liquidator must be transparent, ie at market value. A private transaction is not the immidiate best/allowed solution.
Secondly a private sale would also have affected the market. Any trade of this size is bound to impact the market.
There is no "open market" for bitcoin. There are exchanges, but each of these exchanges is technically a private sale, just that one is bigger than the other.
@_date: 2018-03-08 15:42:29


That is not how liquidations are handled. If a company is liquidated, they don't give you a choice between money or a few chairs and desks. They liquidate the assets, decide how much is recovered and only then can they decide how to divide the assets over the mass of debt proportionally.

Amazing, especially since Apple didn't start paying dividends untill after Job's death.

Because he can't offload than many BTC at 19K. There's not enough buyers willing to buy at that rate.
@_date: 2018-03-08 14:39:36
You gave 450$, you got 450$ back. You were made whole. Potential profits are just that: "potential".
@_date: 2018-03-08 21:08:53


So you mean, where people can bid on the BTC...like an exchange?
@_date: 2018-03-08 14:33:49
You are confusing causality with correlation. His sales did not cause the drops, more likely the drops caused his sales pattern.
This is a liquidator. He needs to liquidate assets at the best possible rate, in a prudent and timely fashion. He can go timely, and dump them all in one trade, but that would not be prudent.
@_date: 2018-03-08 14:40:33


It's a free roll on the companies part.. everything goes to 0 and they don't have to pay anything because they have nothing. Everything goes to billions and you only have to pay a small portion? That is beyond retarded.
And that is why banks want collateral.
@_date: 2018-03-08 14:38:24


The assets were valued at the time of the collapse. Apparently nobody will lose a penny, in fiat value, on the Mgox collapse.


People would not be whining if the pendulum had swung the other way, if BTC was now worth 200 USD. The fact that they missed out on potential revenue, is like the 12-year old kid on this reddit saying "if only I could have bought BTC when it was 0.01 USD"
The knife cuts both ways.
@_date: 2017-10-13 14:17:54
That's nothing compared to the stupidity of the auction, they can simply exchange it for SEK at face value.....

Bitcoin is illegal in several countries. 


Bitcoin was invented, there is a white paper, it was devised by one central entity


Where are the original dollars, used to buy the bitcoin?


“TO THE MOON”


You are litteraly saying that Bitcoing is made of money. Bitcoin is the purest “money making venture”


So have other ponzi schemes


No it can’t. Bitcoin mining gets harder and harder. There is a reason “HODL” is going around. If people let go of HODL, bitcoin collapses like a house of cards


There is no genuine market, it’s one zealot selling to another. MLM schemes don’t have a market, they create one. 


There are thousands of bitcoin unaccounted for, worth millions if not billions of dollars

After 9’000, it soared to 20.000. I watched and shook my head at so much stupidity.

All hail the distributed ledger!
Where is the fiat, used to buy the btc? Also the ledger shows which btc belongs to which wallet, it doesn’t show who owns that wallet.

Oh, I’m sure that bubble can be inflated beyond 20K before it bursts. 
It can also stay at it’s current level and slowly die out, because no one gives a f*&amp;” and it becomes irrelevant
@_date: 2019-09-07 13:15:04
Bought at 4.500, left at 9.000. 
Nothing of real value grows 100% in a couple of months.
