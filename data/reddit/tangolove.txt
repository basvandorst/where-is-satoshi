I bought 2 BTC in 2013 and sold then in 2104 for a profit of $200.00. I was uncomfortable and the $ was not disposable.  I haven’t done the math. 
Not looking back! 
Started buying again in July ETH BTC LTC and a small handful of ALTs. 
Yep too content to look back. 
Get back in if you can.

Proud to be part of this giving. 
@_date: 2018-09-04 15:10:58
I’d be curious how this has changed over the years? Any history to show? 
@_date: 2017-12-12 04:24:57
I’d like to see Andreas and Rodger have a chat. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:07:40
Yes!!! 
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:17:46
Integrity, poise and intelligence. 
After this letter I see he is the real deal. 
Proud to donate!

Thank you!  I’m doing the same in my local community with those in need.  I also feel a foundation brewing over here.  
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:44:32
Me too, exact story! 
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:41:10
Is this why I can’t sleep? Fell asleep at 3am watching a Bitcoin Ted Talk in Spanish thinking it would help me learn more Spanish. Who am I fooling. I’m up now since 6am. 
Officially obsessed. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:48:04
Yep it’s kinda addicting on my end too. Just gave 3 more. I happen to know of many folks who deserve it. It’s a win win crack deal!

Can’t I’m in the bath.

Today I gave 7 Litecoins to random FB friends. Well not random. I made a post offering Cryptocurrency to the first 5 responderá. Got 10 and couldn’t resist so I chose the first 7 instead. Felt great. And that’s not all I’ve done. Creating awareness one coin at a time. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:54:48
Absolutely beautiful. Thank you for sharing your story. It just may inspire the rest.  I’ve personally earmarked 80% of my profits to those in need.   I only started investing in July and my giving started one month later. So much fun knowing that I’m helping folks get some skin in the game. 
Paying it forward one coin at a time.

Could someone respond “BOT” after every bot comment, in order to create awareness?  
@_date: 2019-03-16 05:57:45
Thank you

I thought I heard Andreas talking about a system that will allow us to trade crypto without electricity. Obviously in our future. 
@_date: 2019-06-03 17:35:01
If you are determined to trade, paper trade for 6 months first. And, in the meantime park some of your cash in crypto. Only what you can loose.

@_date: 2017-11-28 22:25:01
Me too, same obsession. Only to folks I know well. 
@_date: 2019-06-03 17:26:00
Do some people store gold and
in safes? Are some of those safes held in banks? Do banks need to be built? Do banks use electricity? Do banks use manpower? Do those people drive their cars to work?
@_date: 2017-11-30 13:34:09
Isn’t it a good idea to have both, paper and hardware wallet? 
@_date: 2019-05-31 17:18:53
Yep
