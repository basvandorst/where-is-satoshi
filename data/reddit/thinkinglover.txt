I just got in the pishing site probably. segwita**d**ress instead of segwita**dd**ress, let's at least turn down the site by reporting to google, so nobody gets tricked again, I already did and is easy:

I am too tired and too angry now, but tomorrow I will do tests with both sites with little money, check the address where the pishing site gets the btc, and check if the legit site is working fine, and get better conclusions. By the time, I encourage eveyone to stay as far as possible of even the legit site

Yes I got response from the website creator, probably just got into the pishing site. I did write it fast and probably messed it up. Good part, I will never forget again how address is spelled.

I did try the mycelium wallet too, it didn't import it because doesn't have segwit support neither. 
I feel like I tried many things and was catched up in the last step, maybe I just did misspelled the website and enter the clone or was just scammed by the "legit one".

I am not even sure I did write the site correctly now seing I misspelled it in this post. But could at least something be done to get the site down? Because I did open it and it exists and is an exact copy of the "legit one" (wich I am not sure how legit it is now).
P.D: english not my main lenguage

No, because I never moved those many bitcoins as that address has being moving sisnce january. You have no idea how careful and obssesive I was till this unfortunately event. I even used dices and the offline vesion of this site to create my paper wallet while waiting for my TREZOR to be even more sure and boom. I encorage you to be obssesively cautios with your coins, never is too much on this space.

I made the test with the legit site, it is working properly, so definetly I did use the pishing site. I have being making this transactions with my TREZOR and is super user friendly and secure, I encourage you anyway to move to hardware wallet and don't make any transaction without it. They truly deserve the fame they got as the best way to manage cryptoassets.

I never heard anything wrong about [segwitaddress.org]( people always said it was legit and being it open source I just did trust on it. Also my paper wallet was created in the site and the money was still there 3 months later. I just wanted to go to my TREZOR for more security but I didn't tought a better way : /. I tried importing the private key to electrum but it just didn't and gave me an not segwit address with 0 balance. I tough about using the samourai wallet but being it in alpha made me doubt too

I did misspelled in this thread, but I checked chrome historial and I am not sure if I misspelled the site because I have right address there. I just sent a tweet to the web creator with all the information, maybe he could check if the transaction actually was made in the legit site.

I made them shut down the site: 
Die Domain
ist nicht verfügbar.
The domain
is not available.
It is not my funds, but at least they will not scam more people.

Right now you can only "invest" on them with paying 1.5%. If you want to convert to fiat again, you gotta pay 1.5% again. Not a great thing but is an advance in my opinion, because they said are going to implement the options to transfer crypto between skrill accounts, and withdraw them to crypto wallets soon. So let's hope they keep their word and do it, because that would be huge and could be a start for other important digital payment companies like paypal to follow the trend.
