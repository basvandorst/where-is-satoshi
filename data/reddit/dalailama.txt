Bravo.  I too have joined a bitcoin company and I'm amazed at what a great cast of people I'm fortunate to have met and work with.  The decision has been one of the best of my life and I only hope to grow within the industry similar to your experience.  All the best to you and your ventures.

I would have kept a whole lot more of my $1500, as OpenBazaar I think you might have to pay is a minimum arbitration fee of maybe .5%, plus the Bitcoin miner transaction fee which is just cents, so let's say I would have paid at most $8, instead of $195, or groceries for a week.

"The supply of bitcoins is fixed at 21 million with 11.5 million in circulation. Bitcoins lack gold’s position as a store of value over time. During the year Bitcoin’s acceptance collapses as investors realize that it cannot be used as collateral in financial transactions and its principal utility is for illegal business dealings where anonymity is important."

There always will be a trust factor when it's consumer to consumer, more so how it was when I first sold on eBay in '97, way before they acquired PayPal in '02 to curb fraud and further centralize. We'll just need to invent more escrow technologies with Bitcoin.

1.) This would really be made for the small coffee shops of the world, not big chains like Starbucks.
2.) Advantages over credit cards: no fraud, no identity theft, immediate settlement, access to everyone, lower fees
3.) I recently moved from the US to Australia and now never use fiat, because every retailer/service uses  Speaking of, I just read that only about 8% of the world's money exists as physical money, the rest is on computers.
4.) Using a cryptocurrency and system such as BaristaCoin and BaristaPay would allow for a complete supply chain solution (see bext360.com), create loyalty/rewards programs with customers, allow coffee shop owners/baristas to invest through an ICO/exchanges, and much more.
5.) Plus, all the other benefits featured with

I bet the fees to both you and the consumer are less using cryptocurrency than every payment option you're currently receiving.
And as a consumer, I would go to the vendor that has a.) the best product, and b.) the most payment options.
Watch the blockpay.com video for the customer/seller perspective.
Reference this for more benefits: 
And I strongly believe, that if merchants don't get with the time, their competitors that adopt new technologies will win.
Hope that helps shed more light.

That's what I'm tying to nail down, what would make a coffee-centric coin succeed. You're right, I see all these other altcoins being built, so I think I'd need final sign-off from the likes of Vitalik or Andreas to settle the viability.
@_date: 2017-04-16 17:03:57
 I had this idea of creating a cryptocurrency coin called BaristaCoin and a POS hardware device called BaristaPay. As a coffee merchant/retailer, would you use that? Includes customer loyalty rewards system, etc.

I'm guessing you've never used Bitcoin; otherwise, I'm pretty sure you'd be in more support, as opposed to siding with other centralized payment options.
Additionally, you stated three reasons why people WOULD care. And without alternative methods, would be forced to used FB's method, similar to being forced to use PayPay, Western Union, etc.
I'd rather support a decentralized currency, such as Bitcoin, as opposed to building Bank of Facebook, or the country of Facebook, but that's also YOUR choice.

I can spend Bitcoin on travel sites like Expedia and CheapAir to buy flights, hotel rooms, car reservations, cruises, etc. I can spend Bitcoin on e-commerce sites like Overstock.com, and now Rakutan sites, such as Buy.com. I can spend Bitcoin at local grocery stores and coffee shops. I can spend Bitcoin to pay my utility bills and rent (Google it). I see Bitcoin extremely useful, without a bank account.

If anything, I think this will help educate more people how easy it is to transfer money, give 1.4B users the opportunity to experience the process, which inevitably will lead to more Bitcoin adoption, so... THANK YOU, FACEBOOK!!!  To the moon, we go!!!

And Ethereum is the new Internet.

As well as on their site:

Earning $96,000 while living in Cape Town, is really like living on $1,000,000.
Btw, you can also have your paycheck ACH into your bank account, and then setup Coinbase to do a monthly $5k purchase in BTC, after taxes.
But, good on ya!
@_date: 2015-03-17 20:43:11
Even better, spend Bitcoin instead of converting it to fiat. ;)
@_date: 2017-05-25 02:44:21
Had it, but sold it to buy ETH.
@_date: 2015-03-17 01:57:40
@_date: 2015-02-25 03:28:50
Can confirm. And there are more than just those 2 options.
@_date: 2015-03-17 01:57:56
Pretty big, because Rakuten is pretty big.

First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win.

I always loved Bermuda.

Guessing Chinese whales.
@_date: 2013-12-24 03:42:33
where are you getting these printed?
@_date: 2013-11-30 14:12:14
First thing I did on Coinbase was converting a smaller increment of Bitcoin, say .1, which was a much more affordable investment.
@_date: 2013-12-14 23:07:03
They will if they're not helped in getting educated. Isn't that what the whole Bitcoin movement is all about?
@_date: 2013-12-13 05:15:24
It's not anonymous because they know your checking account, phone number, email address, etc?  Please let me know if you know of a better solution.
@_date: 2013-12-13 02:24:39
Brace yourselves. Long thread is coming.
@_date: 2013-12-11 04:07:52
@_date: 2013-12-26 01:02:46
Agreed. We need faster turnaround, safer online wallets, and more merchants. Next year.
@_date: 2015-02-16 21:30:56
I would have to say, watching this video a year ago, plus Andreas Antonopoulos' Jefferson Club Dinner Meetup, were the 2 most compelling presentations of where we're going with Bitcoin and the blockchain. Thanks for posting, Jeff.
@_date: 2017-06-11 16:41:44
Seems rational to me. This is gentlemen.
@_date: 2013-12-13 10:20:35
Noted, thanks.
@_date: 2013-12-26 05:51:21
Thanks, twobitidiot.
@_date: 2013-12-29 01:27:25
1.) Bitpay
2.) Coinbase?
3.) Who else?
@_date: 2013-12-24 06:22:46
thank you, kind person.
@_date: 2013-12-26 16:02:01
Wished you lived in my town in order to learn more.
@_date: 2013-12-14 23:26:03
I watched an incredible interview with Andreas Antonopoulos.  He said he wasn't sure if Bitcoin would be THE crypto currency, so he's diversified, which I believe is a good long-term strategy.
@_date: 2013-12-15 08:11:32
Much appreciated.
@_date: 2013-12-13 05:20:58
I've been reading plenty, and I think some of the best knowledge comes from experimenting or doing something; hence, why I want to learn everything there is to make the best choices.
@_date: 2013-12-21 04:19:26
@_date: 2013-12-10 03:57:05
Sound advice and completely agree. Just thinking of ways to include them for the ride, while making a little bit to manage their investment, like 10%.
@_date: 2013-12-13 05:17:55
Thank you! I definitely want to play around with different coin, for the simple reason that one of them might pop, but keeping a majority of my investment in BTC. Any other suggestions beside Primecoin? Been thinking Peercoin, Namecoin, and Zerocoin.
@_date: 2013-12-25 02:47:24
i purchased $200 last week and it showed up in my bank account as $208.84. Does the price move at all between the time I purchase it and receive it, or what am I missing? I also could have made the mistake of rounding up in BTC to .3 and that's what they charged me, but I'm pretty sure I put in a buy for $200. Just curious.
@_date: 2013-12-13 05:11:07
What paper wallet do you recommend?
@_date: 2013-12-13 02:37:21
Upon withdrawal, what's a "Login URL"?
@_date: 2013-12-26 18:44:06
Did that person tell you, or were you able to track all of that?
@_date: 2013-12-26 00:02:41
Hear, hear!
@_date: 2013-12-13 05:18:22
Will do. Thank you.
@_date: 2013-12-24 03:09:53
Can't wait to see Andreas speak in LA on 1/9/14.
@_date: 2013-12-13 05:16:23
Already did that while waiting 4 business days for Coinbase to transfer the amount into my account. ;)
@_date: 2013-12-26 17:00:01
Thanks for the insights!
@_date: 2013-12-09 03:49:55
sure. do you have an example of one already personalized? be curious what it would look like.
@_date: 2013-12-22 20:43:50
I love the "About Us" is still in Latin filler language.
@_date: 2013-12-15 08:12:24
Good insight. Thanks.
@_date: 2013-12-13 10:22:38
I'll have to learn more about this. Thanks.
@_date: 2013-12-07 22:05:29
opened an account and still don't know what's going on.
@_date: 2013-12-06 02:21:46
Great job!
@_date: 2013-12-14 23:06:11
Will do. Thanks for the advice. What's your thoughts on the US exchange, Cryptsy? 
Definitely buying namecoins and primecoins. Thanks again.
@_date: 2013-12-13 05:13:45
2 factor auth has been confirmed, so thank you.
So, leave it all in Coinbase? I plan on investing more and more with each paycheck, so just keep buying more through Coinbase and keep it there?
Yes, I'm curious which are the best cold storage and wallets.
@_date: 2013-12-14 23:08:13
Thanks! A little nervous that they're not in the US.
@_date: 2013-12-10 04:11:14
Very well put, Murray. I truly appreciate your spin and will definitely include it in my pitch.
@_date: 2013-12-14 23:23:52
Oh gotcha. My apologies. Looking for support here!
@_date: 2013-12-13 05:14:26
Thank you. Tempted, but you reconfirmed that voice in my head.
@_date: 2013-12-11 04:09:51
Back up
@_date: 2013-12-13 05:18:47
Very interesting.
@_date: 2013-12-14 23:07:48
Thanks. I bought my BTC on Coinbase, but I don't believe they allow for you to purchase other altcoins. Am I mistaken?
@_date: 2013-12-18 03:35:09
I'm a newb, so wouldn't giving our addresses away be prone to getting stolen?
@_date: 2013-12-15 08:10:55
Understood. Thanks for the heads up.
@_date: 2013-12-26 00:04:29
Probably bitcoinpaperwallet.com, but I just realized that Coinbase has their own, too.
