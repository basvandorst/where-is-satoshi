Yes, hacking another's private key is illegal and China appears to be making this legally enforceable. Regardless, Bitcoin allows someone to securely store their private key and access to funds, so that you, [FESTERING\_CUNT\_JUICE]( have no way of knowing anyone else's private key. So don't worry so much ��

NBitcoin is inspired by Bitcoin Core code but provides a simpler object oriented API (e.g., new Key().PubKey.Address.ToString() to generate a key and get the associated address). It relies on the BouncyCastle cryptography library instead of OpenSSL, yet replicates OpenSSL bugs to guarantee compatibility. NBitcoin also ports the integrality of Bitcoin Core unit tests with their original data in order to validate the compatibility of the two implementations.
