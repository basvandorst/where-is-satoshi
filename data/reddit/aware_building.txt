2 - With all this publicity? Very likely but it could go to 0.
3 - If I had the cash, fuck yes.

What a pathetic little kid.
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:11:13
Not true. Every single person I know(including myself) has started on coinbase and moved on to other exchanges after they got a grasp. So unless everyone I know is the 1% you're wrong bro. Just stop trying to prove a point you can't. You're wrong. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 14:06:02

Our entire sub is filled with the same repetitive, dumb, bullshit.

I'm a robot. I just need my joints oiled up.
@_date: 2017-12-03 19:03:04
User-error, not reading, misinterpretation, and more.
Myself and many others use coinbase all the time without ANY issues. 
If you're going to take brand new blood to the market that can't figure out coinbase and say "Coinbase fucked me!". Yet you are sending them to much more complex exchanges you are creating anbigger problem than you're trying to solve.
Coinbase is the most reputable site available and they even have phone support now. 99% of these "Coinbase fucked me" post they haven't even tried to contact coinbase. Instead they come over here where people like you scream "SCREW COINBASE!"
You're not helping anyone. Sorry dude. But you keep doing you and I will keep doing me.

My help/advice*
It's a pretty stupid idea.
Crazier things have been done.
It's not a get rich quick thing.
You can absolutely lose your ass.
You might become a millionaire.
Are you willing to lose that 50k.
Would you go throw it all on black in Vegas?
If you don't have a family, are single, no pets, and have a very stable job, can afford to lose the money. Go for it. Make an account at Gemini, wire transfer the 50k, don't look at Bitcoin again for two years.

Okay idiot, you can say Bitcoin without speaking about a problem with Bitcoin. He is obviously having an issue with coinbase or doesn't understand that sometimes it takes a while. R/Bitcoin is not a coinbasw support sub, and people need to stop treating it like that. Okay, ya fucking twat?

You're still not understanding that you are making things more difficult for noobs. Noobs don't know how to work fancy exchanges. After they buy their fist 100 bucks of BC from CB and get that big relief off their back of FOMO. Then they can start doing HW and deciding on an exchange that works for them. Noobs can't read charts, understand the market. They want one thing.

Potential scam.
You've been warned.

LMFAO. You don't have the money ya dweeb. I already saw you talking about. 
Fucking idiot.

You could easily look at your transaction history and see when it should be credited.
@_date: 2017-12-01 18:42:56
Pathetic. If you put as much effort into doing something productive in your life as you do dicking around on you might be doing something with your sad little life. The fact you go on another subject just to ruffle feathers shows how much of an immature little pole smoker you are.
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:46:07

Get off YouTube.... You sound like a parrot.
@_date: 2017-12-02 02:30:54
It's always wise to get a wallet and put in there. There is a lot of responsibility when you do that. You have no insurance, the risk is all on you. I personally use Exodus.io
@_date: 2017-12-05 06:06:19
If you got a while Bitcoin, yes get a hardware wallet.
I use a trezor and have a ledger on the way as well! Both great choices!

I've been screaming at my computer screen for the past week with all these people that
1) don't know how to use Reddit
2) Think BTC is all LAMBOSAND ATH FUVKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK YEEEAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!! IIIIIMMMMMM RICH!!!!

@_date: 2017-12-01 19:31:49
Says "I don't dick arount in Reddit history".
Right after making a comment about my history.
You're making this easy.
Also, since you made that "5k to 8k" comment. It would have actually of been impossible to make 80k. Look at the chart, dweeb.
@_date: 2017-12-01 14:36:37
Look at the other comments if you're interested. I would prefer to use a QR reader

@_date: 2017-12-01 15:40:24
So in your opinion is this good or bad for Bitcoin and what do you think will happen with the price action over the next 6 months
@_date: 2017-12-03 19:50:50
YOU MEAN WE'RE NOT THE CENTER OF THE UNIVERSE!?
@_date: 2018-06-27 16:43:52
That's some retarded shit you guys make up. Nobody is stealing anyone's Bitcoin unless it's left on exchanges or people are extremely careless.
@_date: 2018-06-27 16:26:35
This is the stupidest advice ever.
@_date: 2018-06-27 18:28:00
What are you trying to say? Cool cartoon dude.
@_date: 2018-06-28 08:11:09
Well, we all know who has the most BTC. So going after a person who claims to have one BTC is one hell of a small fish to fry. All wallets are on the public ledger and public figures in the community are known for having millions of dollars worth of BTC. 
But, you tried.
@_date: 2018-06-27 16:42:40
No, it's not. If you secure your crypto there's no possible way it's going to get stolen. 
Your advice is some stupid childish bullshit. There have been literally thousands of posts just like this. Nobody is getting their crypto stolen unless their stupid or they leave it on exchanges.
@_date: 2018-06-28 18:10:20
No, just keeping it real.
@_date: 2018-06-28 19:41:55

Yeah, never drive your lambo except on a private race track.
Makes you a Target to get mugged and your lambo stolen.
I try to tell them, but they never listen. That's why my lambo is always in the garage!

Well? Did you find your Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-11-28 10:56:04
Just like opening a bank account.
@_date: 2017-11-04 05:07:38
Oh wow... We have a fucking future teller. You people are ALWAYS wrong. Stop making yourself look stupid! You cannot predict the market. If people could, they wouldn't be in Reddit, they would be out driving LAMBOS!
@_date: 2017-11-19 08:51:31
I'm certain you knew exactly what you were doing when you felt the need to chime in. Keep the insults coming, I love them. Makes you look brilliant. You seem to be getting a little upset? Also, you sure are up late.... Do you not have anything else to do?
Also, how was you commenting to me "just trying to see if the guy was going to eat his testical"?
Because I came here for some comic relief and to read about Bitcoin.... But I got political propaganda.
And please tell me what I'm misinformed of, how rerddit works?
@_date: 2017-11-29 09:44:00
Use a clean PC.
@_date: 2017-11-19 19:01:28
I do use my intelligence for positive means every single day. But according to you I don't have any, fine. I don't need to explain myself to you or anybody. If you think I get on Reddit to make people smile and feel good, you're wrong. If you think you taking time out of your day to post a karma grab from my profile is going to make me lose a wink of sleep, you're wrong. It will probably help me sleep easy. I'm sorry life is tough for you. If you need some pointers I could give you some.

You've been watching way too much TV. While you're right that you could encrypt your HDD, not only it it complete Overkill but it will only protect from someone at your PC. Just store your keys in the correct place. Not even the most paranoid people have enceyted their hard drive for Bitcoin. That's not the use or purpose of it. Not one person here would even suggest that and you don't have yours encrypted.
@_date: 2017-11-30 11:32:23
Nope, were go up to to zero.

Hey man, we get it... You just got into crypto and want to join in on the discussion. But if you don't know what you're talking about, don't give answers or advice. Sit back and try to learn something instead of spreading "I thinks". That's how you learn.
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:20:21
Just use coinbase... People have used them for years dude. It's the simplest way to get started

@_date: 2017-11-29 13:24:50
Coinbase charges high fees to it's users. Look at the reciept, it tells you exactly where your money goes when you buy and sell. It's right infront of you.
@_date: 2017-11-28 17:05:33
You can probably do a wire transfer for less than 10k online. That's how I do it.
@_date: 2017-11-29 10:25:45
20.00 but I do about 20k at a time
@_date: 2017-11-30 10:02:06

@_date: 2017-11-28 17:03:26
Lol. Okay, well why don't you Google Bitcoin security and see what it says about "encrypt your HDD"! That's just stupid. Store your keys, kept it's on a hardware wallet, don't be an idiot. The only thing that encrypting your HDD would save you from is if you had the keys just saved on to a random folder and then got your laptop stolen. So what are you going on about? Dimwit.

Well, even more childish is that you're getting into the middle of two people. One person who just wants to read about Bitcoin without having to sift through political garbage and another who's linking pictures of a subreddit trying to claim that it's okay because that sub is shit. Mind your business.... Go talk about your dumbass politics elsewhere. I don't fucking care what you believe, what party you vote for, anything. This is about Bitcoin. Let's keep it that way. Is that really too much to fucking ask? And I'm the "butthurt"guy or the badguy. Fuck off. Go do something with your life.
@_date: 2017-11-29 08:35:36

Lol, I think it's funny that you keep saying "don't hurt yourself or somebody else".  Like that's supposed to offend me? Seems like you're just scratching at the walls to insult me. Sorry to inform you, I'm much to secure in myself to be insulted or bothered by some kid on the internet. I'm not violent, just don't care to put up with people like you.

@_date: 2017-11-19 18:45:24
You're intervening because you didn't like what I said(because you enjoyed the comment)... Even though, this isn't the place for it. We don't need to insult people for their political beliefs everywhere we go. Sorry. I know that facts hurt your brain. Just admit that you need to keep your mouth shut and try to help the community and not let it become toxic. The fact that I can't even tell someone on a Bitcoin Reddit to not talk politics or insult people without getting people like you is a problem. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 05:50:45

Good call, sir.

Lol... You're going to go buy something else and miss this opportunity?
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:24:24
A lot of people scream terrible idea. Because it is. But many people have done exactly that and profitied very well from it. It's not a guantee and you could lose everything and be stuck with the bill. Can you handle that?
@_date: 2017-11-19 07:01:40
Yeah. I mean, we can keep this going if you like. Let's talk politics in @_date: 2017-11-29 09:08:24

@_date: 2017-11-29 09:34:08
Well, you have some malware that took your Bitcoin. It's obviously not clean.
 How old is your laptop?
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:49:11
I guess you don't understand how many people decided today was the day they were going to buy Bitcoin. I guess every single exchange is just a bunch of idiots because they didn't expect a massive influx of people because they've been doing this for years and seen the news, the FOMO, and the fud. Maybe some of you people that did see this coming should've used your crystal balls to buy Bitcoin when it was .08 cents instead of coming to Reddit when it's 10k, and crying about it.
@_date: 2017-11-20 19:34:04
Follow proper etiquette. That's it. Quit being a fucking political shill. Nobody cares who you voted for. This is about Bitcoin. Keep it that way.
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:13:27
You could start here  
@_date: 2017-11-29 08:52:13
You're a fucking idiot.
@_date: 2017-11-29 13:01:52
Coinbase is insured... But you don't own your coins if you don't have your keys. I would say as long as you keep up with markets and such, leaving them on CB is fine for a while. But if something happens, you're the one to blame.
@_date: 2017-11-20 18:55:01
Good job, you fucking idiot. Quit bringing politics into fucking everything. Keep that fucking trash where it belongs. Look at what you've done to the whole conversation. You people blow my fucking mind that you cant just follow some simple etiquette and keep your fucking opinion where it belongs. Talk about politics on the CORRECT subreddit.
@_date: 2017-11-02 18:16:14

@_date: 2017-11-29 15:57:58
Lol... Idiot.
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:53:14
No... You don't need to buy ASAP. Wait until the servers come up and stop acting like a spoiled little kid who just found out about crypto today.
@_date: 2017-11-20 18:51:25
Have you taken a look to see if I'm still the only problem? Great idea, let's ambiguously bring politics into everything so that nothing gets accomplished. Bravo sir, bravo.

@_date: 2017-11-29 09:27:53
Did you do this on your regular old spank bank PC that you've downloaded a bunch of crap into? If so... You got a virus that allowed someone to take your coin. Don't deal with Bitcoin on dirty computers. I have a PC only for crypto just for this reason. Your bitcoin is gone. Sorry.
That's the equivalent of walking through the worst neighborhood with a clear baggy filled with money.

Is that not hypocritical? Are you not going any longer? I'm confused. We can keep going for as long as you want. I really don't care, no sweat off my back. I don't get my feelings hurt by internet people. For all that talk about me having thin skin it sure seems you were just insecure about yours. Why don't you just "pipe down"?

I really don't get how you think I have anger issues. Just because I'm not nice, doesn't mean I have anger issues. I'm an asshole, always have been, always will be. But I'm damn sure respected because I'm respectable, moral, ethical, reliable, and damn good at what I put my mind to. Quit acting like you know who I am because you like to troll and found someone that could hurt your feelings. So the only way you know to get back at them is to take hours out of your day to go through their history and try to embarrass them. You're fucking hilarious. If I was as useless as you I would take the time to go through your profile. I have better things to do.

Get in now before you never have the chance.
@_date: 2017-11-29 13:15:06
You're not a holder because you have no idea what you're talking about if you have to ask this. Download Exodus wallet and store your coin there. Or do a paper wallet. Quit trying to act like you know what you're doing.

Well, the problem is that you don't know what an Exchange is. Like Binance.com, where you go to trade coins for other coins or tokens. No site sells every coin for Fiat. Also, they can be way overwhelming for new users. Start small.

You will have to remember that wallet you used. Download the wallet again and somewhere it should say "recover". Type in the seed and boom, your coin will populate.
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:03:47
No idea why you people are so sure that this number is special. Do you realize how much publicity this is getting? How many people are runing home to buy Bitcoin no matter what because they want to become a millionaire overnight cuz some guy in the news said it's going to the Moon. You probably won't get back in if you sold. Good luck.. And try to use your brains please.
@_date: 2017-11-28 11:39:02
Thats up to you man. I use CB and Gemini. They work fine for my needs. If you have any specific questions I will gladly help you.

Don't listen to him. They're fine to start with. He's probably complaining about fees.

Good reply. Great way to get new people onto bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-29 13:10:19
I know that they are working on them as we speak but honestly, you need to do your homework with this stuff and invest in what you believe in. I've done VERY well in my portfolio and I only invest into what sells me as a great product.
@_date: 2017-11-29 09:00:31
If you have to ask that... You shouldn't be in Bitcoin.

If you don't know how to do a simple wire transfer... I'm going to be honest, maybe you shouldn't be investing into crypto. It also is interesting that "coinbase won't accept my info". What will they not accept?
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:09:14
Haha, thanks for the laugh!
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:58:22
Lol. Coinbase wanted your bank password? Because you wanted to link the accounts? All this is normal and it's required so they can be regulated by law and insured. The government wants to know where money is going. Keep missing out I guess.
I bet they even wanted your credit card number to add that! OUTRAGEOUS!

@_date: 2017-11-19 03:51:47
Yeah... You should probably be getting to bed. If you can't understand why some people don't want to hear about libtards and racist Trump voters no matter where they are or the context of the conversarion, you're an idiot. Bitcoin sub is for Bitcoin. Take your agenda elsewhere.

@_date: 2017-11-28 09:32:29
New people are absolutely not going to buy alts right away. 99% of people buy Bitcoin because it is the name. It's the frontrunner. It's what people know. Bitcoin is King to the familiar face, its what people see on the news and in the media constantly. Bitcoin will be overwhelming people's first buy.

If you think I was being hurtful or hateful, you are the one with thin skin, bub. I don't need help, I'm not a grown adult starting arguments with people on Reddit because I can't control my feelings about politically charged comments. If you think I was "calling you everything in the book", well I have news for you! Grow up...... Get a life. Learn common courtesy, and etiquette. Life must be hard for someone like you.

@_date: 2017-11-29 13:17:09
Lol... I don't think you understand. You gave coinbase your social security number, name, and more. They are obligated by law to tell the government what you did with that money. The gov will catch up to you and you WILL pay taxes or go to prison. That's it is. Period.
@_date: 2017-11-18 16:13:27
It's about operating on Reddit for the way it was designed. Why don't you take a chill pill because you're making an ass out of yourself. "I CAN TALK ABOUT POLITICS IN HERE IF I WANT". You poor child. Go back to your politics subs. You seem much too immature to be investing in anything. Go argue over things you can't change.

If you don't think that referencing a specific subreddit and insulting them won't stir up a bunch of shit, or is at least asking for trouble on a BITCOIN subreddit, you're wrong. This is about Bitcoin, not The_Donald or any other political sub. Take your agenda and opinion elsewhere. We've gone from a dude eating his testicle because Bitcoin.... to Russia rigged the election. Grow the fuck up you pathetic group of imbicels.

Weird.... Got mine done in literally 30 minutes.
@_date: 2017-09-17 18:30:11
I just did this two days ago. Use Gemini and you can get verified within minutes. Then once your tier 3 verified start a wire transfer from your bank. It's very simple, you just have to Google "(your bank name) wire instructions". You can normally do it by yourself as long as it's less than 10k. 30 minutes later you will have the money in your Gemini account. Buy.
Edit: I wanted to add that most wire transfers will only go through on business days.
@_date: 2017-09-19 04:02:10
Not with a wire transfer.

@_date: 2019-05-10 15:45:32
I did my taxes on 100k in Bitcoin just last month.
Easiest answer: it's not fucking easy.
Other answer: you should really be keeping a speadsheet of when you buy, how much you buy, and the price of Bitcoin when you bought.
You take all that to a CPA and pay them to file capitol gains taxes. Pay the premium and be happy.
@_date: 2019-05-10 17:33:48
