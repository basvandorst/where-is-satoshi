There's value in the powerball. You're paying an amount for a chance at money you could never own any other way. That had value itself.
A simpler example:
Would you be willing to take a 5% salary cut (which will last forever) for a 1 in 100 chance of multiplying your salary by 5 (again, that propagates into the future)?
Mathematics will tell you that's a bad move (surprisingly only just though) but you have an opportunity to earn more than you might ever earn otherwise. And that has its own value.
I can quite easily take a 5% pay cut and continue with my life, but getting 5 times my income would be a massive change. A 1:100 chance to maybe completely change the way I'm living.
Is this really an obvious decision for you?
The powerball is just the extreme version of this with worse odds. Plus when it comes to powerball you could even see it as a voluntary tax. In the case of the UK lottery (where I'm from) a chunk of the income actually goes towards charity projects.
None of this has anything to do with you bulk of your comment where I agree. I just think lotteries get a bad rap.

You're right. It's that people are detached from reality and has nothing to do with your pretentious comment.
What does it matter if one candidate will lose to another? You're not meant to vote for the winning candidate, you're meant to vote for the one you believe in. (Or the one you least hate, depending on situation).
All the minority parties are going to lose, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't vote for them if you want to try and get away from a two party system.
