There are always spikes in transactions whenever fast price movements occur. I always guessed it was traders and holders panicing, but that could be just part of the story.

It is a good thing someone is experimenting with it in case it becomes important, but another thing DAO demonstrated is  ethereum simply can't be trusted to do anything that it promises. I even created a subreddit archive dedicated to keeping the memory of that demonstration alive.

and many complete failures of the chain in the past year while they treat it as a testnet. Which is fine, but don't equate an early alpha to a tested product that chose security over turing complete scripting. Eth gives no value to trustless consensus or security.

yeah, you underpaid - 0.52 USD instead of w/e it recommended
if you own samourai wallet, you can try "child pays for parent" by sending all of the unconfirmed balance to another address you own with a fee that's high enough for old and new transactions combined to go through
then miners might include both to collect the fee

Biggest problem with ethereum is [centralized control by the EF]( and [untrustworthy leadership]( so they are providing something of value by having an alternative.
People and companies are simply afraid to use public ethereum for any important tasks as it proved several times recently not to be reliable only few months ago, which is why their best cases are token sales aimed at non-technical people concentrated around eth for the buzzwords to acquire easy funding in other currencies from "dumb money" or private chains by virtually everyone in eea [linky](
You will not find any cryptocommunity who likes ethereum - it's [universally]( considered centralized/unsecure from their literal actions, not even speculation, and it pretty much makes everyone look bad to have such a misleading project representing crypto to new people. Ethereum value is based completely on misinformation.
Most people I meet are not bitcon maximalists, they are mostly onecoin &amp; eth minimalists for same ethical reasons.

Mutability is not the issue. It's [mutability by the minority]( - we refer to this as lack of security through centralization. 
Bitcoin was changed with perfect support by community. Ethereum was changed with about 5% support of all because it's centralized and unsecure.
@_date: 2017-05-22 13:24:06
Who cares what private chain they run when it's not relevant to the ether token. None of the companies or anyone rational would trust public ethereum chain with even a penny since it's completely confirmed [centralized and unsecure](, which is why every big company in EEA only uses private chains. Hell, [banks even said before public eth is unsecure.](
 [Banks do work with bitcoin to help customers already.] ( So do [merchants]( 
I welcome talk about cryptocurrencies and blockchains, but not fake vaporware like ethereum known best for being the [chain of liars and thieves]( and used mostly for [fraud](Ethereum belongs in same context with onecoin, not next to projects with actual tech behind it.
Come back when your vaporware coin is back in top 3 crypto in actual use after you got flippened out of top 3.

You should at least say what you consider a scaling solution. Do you want one that doesn't compromise on security? Or one that doesn't compromise on global access? I think it is one of many solutions with trade-offs.

Fundamentalists who believe they should always get a bailout? Fundamentalists who prefer centralization and censorship for the morals they happen to like like some fundamental universal morals exist instead of discussion, consensus, and neutrality of the platform?[ I don't think so.](@_date: 2017-05-23 11:10:49
Yup. That's what happens the more shills you have with not enough people explaining how Ethereum is [unsecure and centralized](@_date: 2017-05-23 08:33:25
Buttcoin occasionally has great counter arguments, and a lot of people there actually have bitcoin. There's some benefits to discussions outside a forum built specifically for a single coin with biased voting/rules. Criticism of security, fraud has little to do with price. But hey, different people different opinions of what they think is important.

So afraid 
So so afraid 
Terrified 
So popular 
So few complete technical breakdowns in only last few months:
Such scaling 
Such low fees 
So serious with security 
Such consensus 
So trustworthy 
so "decentralized" 
Definitely not valued entirely based on fraudulent misinformation  
Many centralized companies can be valued higher, it's not a big deal, just like everyone ignores eth, ripple, and onecoin for same reasons.

security has to do with not having to trust some minority and reliability. when banks can't trust their transactions will be honored on a blockchain because a central party has the ability and willingness to change blockchain for self interest, it's not secure. that's pretty much the topic of concern.
Subreddit was just meant as list of sources. But I realized maybe there are too many sources and I should write a summary on which I am working on in pinned message here.  
I used to write those out as comments but got tired of them getting deleted so I made a subreddit.
I have limited time so I only work on it when I see something dumb about ethereum and motivation strikes again. :D
You have a fair criticism, everything has been called falled fraud and vaporware. I usually also lose interest when people say it without showing any sources suggesting so. I am trying to be very careful not to suggest alternative currencies, especially by name to keep focus only on Eth, as I would dismiss that right away as shilling.
I am doing this for fun and anger, and yeah, annoying ethereum supporters is part of the fun and making me feel better. Sorry if it's not ideal. This is only a hobby.

I have little problem with tech - security/centralization concerns are real though and are annoyingly completely ignored.

You need almost 60 confirms on eth (assuming EF doesn't confiscate your money) to be equal to 1 bitcoin confirm in safety, for example based on exchanges. But since EF have [proven]( they can, it would take infinite confirms on eth to have irreversible transaction i.e. impossible. It's hard to compare trustless btc vs trust requiring eth. It's not about blocktime, it's about how fast you can achieve same level of security and censorship resistance, which eth simply doesn't have. Note that security isn't specific to this coin, it's just special case for proven unsecure coins like onecoin/eth/paycoin all with similar security designs.
@_date: 2017-07-02 14:20:29
because people's lives depend on it working and improvements have to be careful and well tested. 
ethereum is closer to onecoin than anything even remotely resembling cryptocurrency. they do not test their code and put anything they want as defaults into their clients, which is what caused the bugs in the first place. so instead of having small scale issues, they start off with massive issues. also happened in their emergency soft fork to "fix" dao as another example that network had to scramble to remove where they eventually got to print money for themselves with a hard fork. there hasn't even been a few months in a row without catastrophic failure of their network.
ethereum is a joke  and all people in it should be treated with all possible force as dangerous enemies of humanity
