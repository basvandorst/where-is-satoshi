I don't know about you, but I think many Americans have some living standards that are just wasteful, and they wonder why they are poor. They max out multiple credit cards and never pay in full. They would rather pay that ridiculous 26% interest on the cc.
Stop drinking Starbuck everyday and stop going to bars partying every weekend. Why do you need so many pairs of jean and so many shoes? You can save a lot just by changing some of your living habits. If you're tight on cash? Buy a cheap Chinese smartphone instead of getting an iphone. And forget about getting a girlfriend. Every $$ goes toward your rent, utility, grocery, and insurance above all else. You can't save when you're paying all that interest on that cc.

No. Wait til $8,000 to $9,000 and see where we go from there. Right now we are about to test the support line, a psychological barrier at 10k. If it breaks there, you will see a lot of hands get shaken out. The trading volume will also pick up very rapidly when the price gets there.

10% gain a year on crypto is awful with the huge volatility and the risk associated with it. Heck, i think even 30% return on bitcoin is an awful return too. I can get that kind of return by picking tech stocks which don't carry the risk anywhere close to cryptocurrencies.
Investing is not just about return. There are always two sides of thing which are risk vs. reward.

It would help increasing your probability of success, but it doesn't always work. What technical analysis tell you is the current market sentiment. If you know how to read chart, you can gauge people's behaviors and act accordingly. Just a simple reading candlestick can tell you so much about people's psychological mindset. You also have to apply other indicators to further help your judgments. Charts will present many more opportunities in front of you than just you holding.
Like i said, there's no guarantee. If you don't believe this stuff just HODL like rest of the long-term investors do. At the end of the day, it's a gamble, but at least you have more tools to help you taking calculated risk rather than just blind betting.

lol. Nvidia could care less about crypto crashes. Crypto mining isn't its only business you know. It certainly helps as more people buying the gpu, but the market bids up the stock mainly for its future AI and data center division.

There's a B share where you can buy it for much less for. It is designed for smaller investors who can't afford A share. Companies do this to attract new investors when their stock prices go too high. It's called a stock split.
Beside the point, let me explain how stock works. Berkshire generates about $24 billion in profit every year. You, as a owner of the company, get a piece of that profit and share it with every other people who have a stake in the company. The company can share that profits in term of dividend giving to the stockholders, or the owners trust the management and let the company reinvests those profits back into the company to further grow the business so it can make more profits than $24 billion the following year.
In addition to the cash flow every year you make as a owner, a business obviously should worth more as it makes more money, so more and more people coming in want to own that a piece of that pie, thus you also get capital appreciation for your holding in the business. Since company has a limited amount of shares out on public, price goes up as more people want in. Gold, Bitcoin, or any other commodities only have this part of the equation. You can't make more bitcoins by just holding bitcoins, except you operate a mining business, which has a cost associated with it.

In this case, most people would actually just sit on their money. To give you a perceptive, the stock market gives about 8-9% average return a year over the course of 70 years, and you know the market is way more volatile than just parking your money on treasury bill or in savings.

The current bitcoin community? I doubt that. If the price does crash 90% from here, many people trying to mix into the HODLers' community will get flush out due to their fear. A lot of people use leverages too so they will rush out to the door when the price collapses. By then, the only HODLers left are the people who actually bought bitcoins for under $1000.
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:02:44
how can you short bitcoin unless you sell its future contract?
@_date: 2018-01-22 16:34:10
Not yet. You want to see post like "I hate bitcoins. Lost all my money. It's a scam! Don't ever wanna touch it no more."
When the faiths for some of these HODLers start shaking, that's when you start buying. By the time the price shreds 90%, the only HODLers still here are the people who bought bitcoin below 1k.
@_date: 2018-01-16 06:54:46
All futures are cash settlements, which mean they don't directly influence the supply and demand of the underlying asset. The future basically adjusts its price close to the spot price which is based on the Gemini's bitcoin index.
Large institutions have strict rules in regards to securities. If their clients asking for cryptocurrencies exposure, institutions can't directly buy bitcoins through unregulated exchanges for their clients. So people thinking Wall St. manipulates the actual bitcoin price is a myth. Bitcoin price fluctuation is currently all driven by retail investors and VCs.

Gold is nothing but a hedging instrument. The minuscule industrial use has very little effect on its price. It generates no cash flow like security does. Gold is not bad to have a small position in your portfolio to hedge against inflation or during bad time. 
All commodities are garbage long-term investments imo. They are great if you know how to trade them. That's about it.
@_date: 2018-01-21 19:04:36
Down. During economic recession, everybody panics and just wants to hold cash paying for necessities rather than taking additional risks. This is when deflation happens. All assets' prices plunge.
If Bitcoin acts like gold does, then it will go up if the government starts printing money trying to save the economy.
@_date: 2018-01-16 20:51:18
how about it goes back down to 1k from here? That will be the true test to HODLers. A 90% haircut. By that time, you would know all the public memes and greedy pigs are gone. Watch all those people lose their money and say how shitty bitcoin does to their wealth and mental health.

Just sit and enjoy the show. I already had massive gains from just 3-4 cryptos. I'm well-off as I took profits at around 14-16k and use the money elsewhere. I'll revisit when it is appropriate because I believe right now the space is just filled by greed - normies and grandmas who just want to get rich quick. 
Crypto currently is only about 5% of my total investment. During the run-up last year, it became 15% which was just too much risk I could handle so I had to sell. This is a sure way not to get greedy.
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:57:26
Warren Buffet never tell anyone to invest in USD. He tells people to invest in stock, bond, or real estate; something that generates CASH FLOW.
Bitcoin has no earnings thus it doesn't provide cash flows. Same with gold and other commodities.
@_date: 2018-01-14 22:17:07
Of courses, high deflation leads to economic recession to depression. If you know your money would increase in value tomorrow, why would you ever spend it? even if it's on necessary goods because you know you can get those goods cheaper the next day. If everybody thinks this way and no one is spending, economic activities slow down. In order for economy to grow, you want inflation. Increase spending leads to higher economic activities.
But too much inflation is not a good thing either. In the case of hyper-inflation, money becomes worthless as goods' and services' prices soar and no one can afford anything. When necessary goods become unaffordable to the public, you get social unrest and riots as people starve for foods.
I think some people in this sub-reddit ACTUALLY believe the USD will eventually share the same fate as Venezuela to experience hyper-inflation because of our growing debt level. People are retarded if they actually think the US economy is anywhere closely going that way. It just shows that people have lost trust in our government regards to monetary policies since the financial crisis of 2008.

No, people investing into cryptos are simply because of their greed. You can still believe in the technology instead of dreaming about if bitcoin would hit $1 million a coin.
Don't invest more than you're willing to lose, you will be fine if you do that. If it works out in the end, consider yourself lucky and treat those as extra profits which you didn't have before. If bitcoin price crashes to oblivion, no hard feeling. Don't be those delusional dreamers borrowing money/mortgage their houses betting on cryptos and just hoping to get rich quick. That's how bubble is formed. Greedy pigs deserve to lose everything.

@_date: 2018-01-14 21:16:07


Because there's a thing called "risk." Not everyone is about maximizing return with his investment. Every investment carries risk. It's just degrees of risk to which some people would tolerate riskier investment while other people don't.
So a proper way to say is "what is the highest possible risk-adjusted return investor can get?" If the current risk-free rate is 10%, any rational investor would not take a return for less than 10% because it is not worth the risk to make those investing decisions.
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:13:09
you do realize that dropping 30% has a greater magnitude in change than an increasing 30%?

If bitcoin's price falls 90% from here, i bet you 99% of the people won't be a believer anymore lololol.
The entire crypto frenzy sums up in one word - greed. Who cares about the tech behind it really? like 1 every 10000?
When you hear "believers" yelling "bitcoin is going to replace banking entirely" or "bitcoin goes to $1 million by 2020" and getting their moms and pops involved by taking out mortgages to bet on cryptos, you know the euphoria is real as most people are just being delusional. Greed can blind people to think logically.

How could you report loss for trading bitcoin if it's not regulated? or was it just classified as an asset class recently?
If it's classified under gambling law then you can report the loss for tax deduction only if you have other gains through gambling.
@_date: 2017-12-30 22:26:58
So crypto is taxed as capital gain? or is it taxed under gambling law?
As far i know the gain is treated as capital gain only if you hold the asset for over a year. If you trade in and out of securities within a year, the gain you get is subjected to ordinary income tax.
Bitcoin is not under a security law. Was it classified as an asset class recently?
@_date: 2017-12-31 06:52:47
This is a myth. Most institutional investors aren't allowed to buy bitcoins directly for their clients, and they certainly can't directly short bitcoin. The bitcoin futures you see on CBOE and CME are all in cash settlements. Buyers and sellers of the future contract just use bitcoin's price index to settle the differences. Wall St. ain't stupid enough to hold a widely volatile instrument as bitcoin that has almost no liquidity.

Let me make an analogy for you when people venturing into new techs. The internet = blockchain; random dot.com websites = cryptocurrencies.
The blockchain technology is REAL, but the prices of the cryptocurriences ain't realistic at this point. Where is the mass adoption for payments? It is mostly driven by hype and greed. Bunch of shitcoins will disappear just like those shitty websites during the dot.com bust. Bitcoin will probably survive, but not after its price crashes first. It will then take YEARS to recover as the hype dies down because people stop believing in it.

It would be one hell of a bull trap if we head back down to 6k.

blockchain = internet; random shitcoins = random .com websites.
Totally an apple to apple comparison. All the altcoins are built base upon the open-sourced blockchain technology and modified with some other features. Just like all the websites are built on the internet.
When crash happens, 95% of the shitcoins will go to 0 just like in the dot.com bust. Bitcoin will survive because it's the first and most well-known, but we don't know if it will still be the most dominated coin in the future as the blockchain technology advances.

"All the technology stocks in early 2000 were worth 3 TRILLION."
When you use that analogy and refer to the frenzy back then, to me it implies it's just gonna blow up like in 2000. Most of those companies ceased to exist and only a handful survives. I'm sure Bitcoin and its technology will probably survive, but I can imagine many other digital coins will probably disappear because the price of the coins gets crushed to death, causing it to become no longer profitable to operate a business around those digital currencies.
@_date: 2018-02-01 15:43:01
In OP's case, what he supposed to do was selling some of his bitcoins if he has made money on them. Take some profits to cover his initial investment plus some gains, then he could let the rest of them ride the way. Even if whatever left ends up 0, it would still hurt but at least it was all house money at that point. He wouldn't get shaken out despite all the volatility.
As you watch crypto's price went parabolic and your portfolio has gotten way too big that would affect you emotionally, you take some profits to reduce your position size. That's called risk management.
What the OP and probably many people have done here is a typical average-to-poor person trying to get rich quickly like "all those crypto millionaires" he hears so much about, thus people bet everything on it; since you know, they are "claimed HODLers" who believe bitcoin will get to $1m a coin. It is greed at its finest.

This is why most people don't understand what money is. Yes, paper money is just a medium of exchange that people put trust in it to transact. Since we don't want to go back to the stone age trading items for items, we assign a value to a piece of paper that's legally tendered by the government.
Physically speaking, it's just a fuking piece of paper. The whole reason that piece of paper has any value because it is backed by that country's economic earning power, its ability to pay its debts, its military defense and sovereignty. USD just happened to be the reserved currency because it has the world's strongest military and the largest economy. The whole "trust" system is created because people know who's and what's behind the dollar.
Currency is not meant to be a store of value. If you want something that stores value, you buy asset classes. What is behind bitcoin other than "someone else would pay a higher price for it?" Bitcoin has 0 economic earning power. It's not the only unique digital currency out there either.
You can argue the fundamental value bitcoin has is the blockchain technology and its ledger system, but how come every other shitcoins out there has it too? If people are betting on blockchains, other coins have faster transactions and lower fees. The only reason bitcoin still the most dominated crypotcurrency is because of the brand. It's the first one. That's it.

Not trying to troll, but just stating the truth. Let be honest here, most people here right now are just using it as a trading vehicle to profit. There are some long-term holders as well who really believe it will take-off. As for using the currency to actually buy something...I'm not so sure with that volatility. You can use .03 BTC today to purcahse a pizza. and then suddenly you may have to pay double the amount for the same item if the currency devalues quickly in the near terms. Who knows what will happen tomorrow with this thing. It's too unstable to be used as money right now. Oh, and the vendors who currently accept BTC, they are in the same boat from the first category - to hope that everybody else adopts to the cryptocurrency so their speculations would pay-off immensely. And if this thing goes to oblivion, well that's the risk you know and are willing to take.

or it can just drop another 30% and then try to stabilize from there. you know the volatile nature that the cryptocurrency has.

You guys all got jebaited. The price is too easily manipulated by the whales.

or you know, you can always just take some profits off the table, but not all of it if you want to hold some thinking it can go higher.

Yes, but DCA will also lower your average return on a rising market. DCA means you invest a fixed amount at a regular time intervals. You are indifferent to whatever the price of the asset currently is at.
A better comparison would be DCA vs. lump sum investment strategy, since both have risk-reduction effect base on lowering your average purchase price over a period of time. So what's the risk-adjusted return if you do DCA over 12 months periods, regardless whatever the bitcoin price is at every month, comparing to the risk-adjusted return if you just buy bitcoin **only if** every 20% or more draw-down on the bitcoin's price in a lump sum investment for one year.
People who buy ETFs over individual stocks look for an entirely different method to reduce their risks to the assets. That's why I didn't really get why you compare the two strategies because they have almost nothing to relate with each other, except the way you described to try to explain to me about average return value.

we are going OVER 9000!
@_date: 2017-05-24 14:20:09
this looks like it's going to 3000. It's like up 7-10% everyday.

So who catches the falling knifes and left bag holdings.
@_date: 2017-05-09 15:15:34
lol the greed is so strong here. taking on such a huge risk is just asking for trouble.
like everyone else here, i hope he's really just a troll.
@_date: 2017-05-27 19:54:02
because it can always go higher? how did he know that would be the top? based on the principle of bitcoin with limited supply, it can reach $10,000 a coin in the long term. (words from the bitcoin believers)

lol, did you seriously just compare dollar cost averaging to switching from purchasing individual stocks to ETFs? The principle of dollar cost averaging has nothing to do with the principle of buying a basket of stocks.
Buying an ETF has a diversified purpose, which reduces risk because if one stock fails, there are still other 199 stocks performing. Dollar cost averaging on a single risky asset does not reduce your risk exposure to it...All it does it's lowering the average purchase price so you won't feel as bad when it's dropping, and perhaps the price starts to rise over your lower average purchase price, you would start turning a profit again after the accumulation. There's no diversification here.

Because a lot of people believe it is a zero-sum game in this space. Once everyone flocks to the new cryptocurrency with better an algo and technology, the value of bitcoin starts decreasing.
@_date: 2017-06-12 15:04:35
lol, so ethereum is taking over bitcoin in market cap? the original king of cryptocurrency is about to be dethroned.
time to mine ether i guess.
@_date: 2018-12-07 01:58:15
you will probably get it this weekend at this pace lol.
