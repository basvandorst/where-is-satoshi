Oh sorry. Didn't see that the first time around. Apologies.

What's the advantage of your site to a simple freight forwarder? I mean ordering something on the internet is a matter of a couple clicks. I would not need somebody else to do that for me?
To be able to order "In-Store-Only" items is a different story. I like that possibility.
What do you charge for shipping to central Europe?

Does anybody have experiences with Shakepay. It sounds nice. The FAQ mentions "can be used at contactless terminals using Shake's Android app". Do many stores have those terminals. I live in central europe (Austria). I know that many shops have some sort of contactless terminal. But so far I've only seen people paying with bank cards. Does virtual VISA work everywhere?

Very good. Thanks for the answer.

Gee, non-stop Deja Vu.

Yeah, I am out. I'll use other sites from now on. I don't want to see that f*** cloudflare page not one more time!!!

I've but all my BCH into coinomi yesterday, transfered them to HitBTC and sold them for BTC and transfered the BTC out in my Bitcoin wallet. Took me 2-3 hours altogether. But then it was done. It was interesting but also a bit scary. I'd never used coinomi nor HitBTC before. But it worked pretty much flawless.
@_date: 2017-08-04 17:17:50
Yes, I was also a bit late too to the game. Also sold just a bit over 0.11.
@_date: 2017-08-03 08:10:39
I created a new wallet with M/44H/0H/0H and then swept in the coins from my old non-coinomi BTC wallet/addresses (private keys exported from Bitcoin armory). So far that worked. The Coins were confirmed after a while.
But I don't understand the significance of changing the derivation path. Did I even need to do that, since my BTC wallet was not a coinomi wallet? Are there any dangers spending the coins from this wallet with the different derivation path. As an experiment I just created another BCH coinomi wallet with the default derivation path. Can I send the BCH coins to this new wallet just normally?
@_date: 2017-08-02 10:31:11
You mean fees?
@_date: 2017-08-02 14:54:13
Are you sure? I thought the fee is usually calculated based on the bytes of a transaction. Like 50 or 100 sa/Byte. And the more outgoing addresses you have in a single transaction the more bytes are needed?
@_date: 2017-08-04 22:53:50
I withdrew in BTC. I didn't see a limit. But then it wasn't that much I was left with in BTC. The exchange rate was already in the cellar yesterday. But yes, I only needed email for registering.
@_date: 2017-08-02 20:04:44
Oh I see now. All that dust was received on a single address. So there would only be one outgoing address if he were to spend it all. Thanks for clarification.
@_date: 2017-08-03 10:27:12
Well I just made a small test transaction to the freshly created BCH wallet without the changed derivation path an there were no problems. 
I still would like to know what it means to change the derivation path. I don't like to blindly follow instructions from the internet. :-)

With bitcoinbon.at you don't transfer money. You buy coupons with cash. Try to reverse that!
@_date: 2017-07-30 23:53:43
Thanks for the answer. Sounds like a horse race :-D
@_date: 2017-07-29 21:43:07
Right. It has one good effect though. People are moving their coins to a private wallet. That was always one of the top rules: Keep all your coins in a paper or private wallet and use exchanges only for trading. But nobody ever listened. They do listen now though :-)
@_date: 2017-07-29 22:44:02
@_date: 2017-07-29 21:35:41
Step 1 is only needed if your coins aren't already on bitcoin core, right?
@_date: 2015-02-06 21:33:48
Nice. I will definitely give it a try once you open up in Austria.
@_date: 2015-02-04 19:07:01
Bitcoins are great!!!

I also say Armory. However it does not use parts of the chain stored on a server. Instead it downloads the complete chain locally (about 150GB). This could take a couple days if you start it the first time. So it might be too late if you're only starting now. I would suggest one of the lightweight wallets others suggested. And then later move them over to Armory.

Oh. Thanks for taking the time to answer me personally. Appreciate it.
@_date: 2017-07-30 10:54:58
best post of the day!!

True :-D
an off topic question, if you don't mind. How were you able to see my post? I checked and it didn't seem to show up on (sorted by new). Must have done something wrong.
