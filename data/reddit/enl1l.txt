BU have 70% of the hash rate under their control.

I would accept either a soft fork, or a hard fork with 95% hash power required to accept the change.

This looks quite a bit different. Look at the nice linear slope of the increase. There is someone running a program to output transactions onto the network.

We don't need internet backbones anymore.

I thought segwit was needed for liquid ? Apparently not.
The marketing for liquid :
Instance bitcoin transfers, liquid transactions are real bitcoin, confidential transactions,..
Basically sums up what bitcoin is lacking right now. What's the catch here ? How much increase in capacity, what are the fees ? Anyone have further information ?
I'm surprised that we aren't seeing discussion of this.
@_date: 2017-08-19 14:35:29
It's not even about 2X, it's about power. Core *does* have some sway over the development of bitcoin. They have obviously pissed off some people by not catering to their interests. This is (Jeff, Jihan, Roger) attempt at getting control. 
I'm not a core maximalist, and if core is dethroned by a superior dev group that is good for bitcoin. However, atm, there is no competition. The rational thing to do is to allow core to continue maintaining bitcoin.

alt coin money is going into Bcash. Traders will trade. Pump will happen. The few people in the money will make 2x to 3x returns. Dump will rekt some people. Then money will flow back into bitcoin just as btc people start saying doom. That's my bet, anyway.

One of the few bitcoin companies investing in infrastructure. This is awesome to see.

It's a hard fork so no new coin. Though some parties apparently are making a new coin as well..

I don't see this going well for bitcoin. Head line news: Pharmaceutical crook uses bitcoin to pay for Kanye West album. Or some shit like that. ( He's lying about the bitcoin payment )

In all honesty, "to the moon" isn't a serious suggestion or speculation.
IMO these days, it's an inside joke we bring out for a chuckle now and then.

He's a smart guy. Probably hedging his bets. He's just as happy enslaving the population as becoming the next bitcoin billionaire. He probably has a stash of bitcoin if he's advising for 21. 
These people aren't stupid. They play the game.

No there is the initial transaction of 80k btc in 2011. From then on it is like 1 to 2 transaction each month of &lt; 0.001 BTC.

Not sure who is the winner here.
Google and others will have to pay us for the data, we currently surrender freely. But we may have to pay (microtransactions) for their services as well.
@_date: 2015-11-04 11:07:11
wow close to 500 on huboi
@_date: 2015-11-04 11:14:36
I had a terrible thought - someone is buying up all the bitcoin only to destroy the private keys. That's how you kill bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-11-27 12:10:15
Infrastructure costs - who is going to pay for renting computing power on the cloud ? What is the incentive to add features ? What will be the incentive to ensure a quality service ? Who will mediate disputes between drivers and riders ? What about assisting customers with the service ? Who will keep track of user numbers and buy more server capacity as necessary ? 
But I'm not disagreeing with you. It's going to be more complicated than just 'writing an app'.
Eventually I see a bunch of good sanitarians (like Satoshi) coming together and developing the software. Perhaps funded in part by the public.
In the long run I think all the above will be solved by intelligent agents. And we are seeing the start of such things with Watson, Cortana, google now, etc. Autonomous companies in other words.

Ya missed the part where he says "the best part is that these bitcoin aren't associated with your identity on an exchange".

Everyone is thinking the same thing...

I was talking about the next 9 days - might have been unclear. I don't see much happiness for bitcoin in the short to medium turn if segwit doesn't get through via 91. And if we get to 148, my bet is price retraces back to 1k and lower.

coindance reporting expected lock in
@_date: 2017-07-20 10:21:33
Simply look at the charts, price has been well correlated with the probability of bip91 lockin. It's rallying *right now* because lock in seems more probable.
For this period we have 80% blocks signalling 91.. could actually happen this period if we get a bit lucky and miners don't fuck around.
@_date: 2017-07-20 09:07:06
Miners must know if segwit doesn't activate we all lose. And I'm not just talking about speculators waiting to make a buck. Future of crypto hinges on the next ~9 days.

We need a unique ID which is not forge-able and can't be stolen or coerced form an individual. We need a decentralized store of all unique ID's (without necessarily connecting that ID to a person to ensure privacy). We need some safeguard to ensure ID's cant be made public.
For example consider everyone on the planet voting on something. How can we ensure everyone gets one vote ? How do we verify that the person claiming to hold that ID actually voted ? How do we ensure that everyone voted ?
I think one way to do this is with some kind of bio-metric implantable device. Activation of the device would require both mental effort and physical effort. So someone can't just push your body against a scanner and read the contents. The ID might be generated from your DNA or some other inherently unique attribute of a human being ?
The ID could even be used to generate bitcoin private addresses. Now the private key can't be stolen and exists as long as you exist. Similar to that person who implanted a chip with his priv key, you could use your body to validate transactions. This is a crazy brain dump but we are allready seeing technology which could lead in this direction.
@_date: 2017-07-22 04:18:34
So true. We need to make tumblebit, confidential transaction a priority before bitcoin becomes too popular.

There were a number of detailed medium posts written up. The main point is that :
@_date: 2017-07-06 01:41:46
It's a fake out. Pump and dump. Increase segwit signalling, watch price go up. Sell. Stop segwit signalling.
I may or may not be overly cynical...

Lightning network is best used for micro transactions, ( Possible $100 per person per month paying for micro-transactions for internet content), requiring *instant* confirmation.
No one ever suggested LN was going to be completely distributed. Seems like this person has assumed everyone believed LN would be completely P2P ?
Exchanges won't be risking all their BTC as collateral in a big LN hub. Users will join together and create hubs via 2 of 3 multisig ( 1 user, 1 hub, 1 thirdparty ) to eliminate hacking risks. This way users could earn interest on their savings via fees. The whole system could be orchestrated using smart contracts potentially. This also gives whales incentive to put their stash to good use.
Why scale on chain for small daily transactions ? Retailers won't accept 1 confirmation bitcoin payments. And there is 10mins to 1 hour ( extreme) variance on confirmation times. Doesn't make sense. I want to be able to pay for my coffee, instantly confirm it, and leave.
