I've had a bad experience with PayPal before too
I noticed couple hundred bucks missing from my account.. Turns out some guy was claiming that I had bought an Xbox from him, but I hadn't I already had one why would I. I still don't get how it got to be, but I got my money back at least😄

I would just set up tezor on their page, create new wallet in electrum (with hardware.. pick trezor) and then i would be able to send to my trezor account, and only extract with my trezor plugged in? am i getting it right?

Im sure there will be hundreds of thousabds of different coins, what is your point?
@_date: 2015-11-11 22:02:04
so you are saying the latest version has no expert mode?
so will it generate new addresses as i go or is there something else that has to be turned on?
@_date: 2015-11-12 06:57:07
I read that in order to enable the use of multiple addresses you have to turn on expert mode. But i am being told this might just be an old feature

ty for all the answers I am definitely going with the hardware wallet.
but then say i have my savings on this main wallet ( a lot of money) and i have to buy something, could i still transfer some of it to say my electrum account in order to use them?
@_date: 2015-11-11 22:19:07
Does that have any impact on my addresses? Dude xdd
@_date: 2015-11-12 18:22:16

@_date: 2015-11-12 09:04:32

not thinking of cashing out like you described, Ia msaying i am done with paper money, where the government at any time can print 3 times more and decrease the value of what i have to the point where i need a wheel barrow to buy bread.
But one day maybe you cant but bitcoin with paper because it is simply worthless paper
@_date: 2015-11-11 14:04:23
haha it wont be 1 year, but you do know it happened right? and you do know that history repeats itself. money issued by a ruler has always failed or caused great problems. just like rome in the old days

you think bitcoin will wither? Is is not the future? and in some years, when there is an other major bank failure like the great depression or in 2008 after the rich people play with all of our money and fuck up, wont that help to further establish bitcoin?
or as we saw in Greece where banks wouldn't cash out
more and more place take bitcoin, more and more possibilities and ways to secure your coins. And if people ever wake up, they will want the anonymity it (can) provides
