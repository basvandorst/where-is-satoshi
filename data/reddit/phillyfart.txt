There’s no underlying fundamentals that determine valuation. The price is literally set by what people are willing to pay in that moment.

Well, you should want a more diversified portfolio. Pulling out of oil might be a good decision now. Research what that means, and where you want to invest instead. Whatever percentage you want to invest in higher risk investments (typically 10-20%), allocate toward bitcoin. 
On another note, assuming this isn't a troll, don't squander your life changing windfall. Your willingness to acknowledge the risk that you may throw away $200k shows some immaturity, and is exactly why this amount of money was put in a trust in the first place.  Found money seems to leave faster than earned money. 
For reference, the average american's net worth is around $80k.

I am not a tax professional, seek proper counsel. 
However, It will be treated like any financial exchange. If you spend it, or exchange it, you need to pay taxes on the increase in your currencies purchasing power. If you're holding; not spending or exchanging it, then you're fine. 
That being said, you need to review your municipal requirements annually. For example, US tax code and their potential to go to "first in first out" this will effect things. 
If you have records of purchases and sells, a qualified tax professional should be able to do this for you pretty quickly. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:53:42
Laughing or crying over these prices. Don’t choose the latter.

@_date: 2017-12-13 03:59:08
So like PayPal 
@_date: 2017-12-01 17:35:42
Sure. But seeing as several governments have already banned it and the US IRS just won their lawsuit against coinbase to turn over information in accounts, it's already headed that direction.  
@_date: 2017-12-09 06:00:27
Right. Which is why they many and most 401k monies are in mutual and hedge funds . 
The citizen investor is thrilled at 10% annual returns. Fund managers can hit that mark if they effectively exploit the volatility in a market. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:47:04
Why would you leave it in as dollars? Leave it in as BTC, or cash it out. Coinbase is probably safe, but if shit hit the fan it's not federally backed and you'll have no real recourse. 
Edit: it is FDIC insured.

I'd still throw a portion into the coin. Though if you had to emergency cash out you may be over-leveraged . 
@_date: 2017-12-05 00:32:58
This kind of proves the opposite. But also bitcoin isn't a stock so they're not comparable. 
@_date: 2018-09-22 17:08:16
Nope, definitely didn’t say that. 
That’s a funny stance to take defending a roller coaster if bitcoin GIVEN the context of the situation that were still down from this months high. And only up 3% from earlier in the week. 
Let’s discuss. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:11:38
I have no real proof either besides observation, but think the same thing as well. Makes sense
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:51:21
The fees would be a loss. The increase in purchasing power in relation to the dollar would be gains. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 13:52:52

You need to be calling 5 bitcoins at a time. So unless you have nearly $100k (or actually $120k, since it has a stop at 20%) to fulfill the contract, you're out.

I wouldn’t consider maintaining a balance of less than $1,000 in your savings account “saving” in its verb form. 
According to the U.S Census Bureau, the per capita income for the overall population in 2008 was $26,964, which would translate to a single bi-weekly paycheck (before taxes) held in a savings account.

You’re right...the reason the US dollar is the global currency is because it’s the oil standard, therefore effectively current energy standard. 
the reason the US dollar is used as the oil standard is because it has the largest economical, military and political power. 
You’re argument basically bets against oil, the US economy, military and global position. 
You might be on to something. Probably not. 
@_date: 2018-06-25 19:39:00
Well wait a minute. It’s not robbing the poor if most of the money goes to the poor. 
@_date: 2018-06-24 02:08:26

@_date: 2017-11-28 21:31:13
Definitely don't fully leverage this loan on a depreciating asset like an automobile. Seems this type of loan would be ideal for downpayment assistance, or as a small business loan. If you have the canines to invest it in something as volatile as bitcoin, go for it, fortune favors the brave. 
But don't kid yourself that there's no downsides or risk. 
If bitcoin were to tank to $0, this loan would likely eat in to about a quarter of your take home income every month. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 04:29:01
@_date: 2017-11-03 14:29:57
Those who argue from logic would claim it's an ad hominem. Who's buttering your bread?
Bitcoin is a currency or commodity, depending on your point of view. What's it's true value? Nobody knows yet, but currently the market is deciding its higher than it currently is. What will it be a year from now, what causes and uses will determine that value is to be determined. 
Stocks, Bonds, Derivatives? Those are value producing assets. Do they become overvalued or experience fraud-driven overvaluation at times? Yes. 
How about Sub Prime Loans? Inherently, no. Tinkering with the credit ratings of the loan packages trading between lenders, that certainly caused a bubble. 
What about Ether? I'm not sure what that's supposed to mean. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 19:09:22

@_date: 2017-11-29 03:16:00
Well, you're not the only one. Just know you're ahead of the pack wanting to invest in anything at 20, so that's a good thing. 
The premise is essentially that it's a peer to peer payment system. No bank needed, no monthly minimum, no 4 day holds on transfers. Also, It's not being regulated by a federal reserve, which can just decide to print money if they want, to influence inflation and interest rates. 
Just don't put in more than you can afford to lose. And throw some cash in some normal investment vehicles too. Diversify your bonds.

@_date: 2017-11-05 14:34:28
Moving money out is quick with paypal.
In with a credit card is instant but more expensive. The up to 10 day ACH hold on bank transfers seems a bit much. 
@_date: 2019-01-22 12:21:06
In this analogy is Kansas price higher or lower than California? 
@_date: 2018-02-15 20:38:55
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:31:55
Does it matter? If one of the most popular platforms to display the value suddenly shows a lower value, it’s going to impact the value and psychology of the market. 
I’m not going to get into an argument where the goalposts get moved every step along the way.

You're first point is solid. 
I respectfully disagree with your second point. It was worth 14btc when the purchasing power was much less.

Ironically the "gold watch" is so closely associated as a Merit badge with success it's kind of silly. Does any company actually give gold watches with retirement anymore?

No advisor would ever tell you to invest 100% in something so volatile. 
From his own twitter: "It’s a key point... a prudent allocation is important, similar to what advisors typically allocate to gold or commodities"

If you have a credit card with 4% cash back, this washes out fees, and allows you to effectively trade on margin on a revolving monthly basis.

@_date: 2017-10-22 17:08:34
Except your assertion that a $20 watch is still worth $20 several decades later, regardless of appreciation and depreciation. 
Funnily enough I was at a flea market yesterday with vintage watches, $40 for any watch. Some of which were Movados and Gold Plated Bulovas, which sold for $1,000+ new several decades ago.

You're even weaker for instead of elaborating on your viewpoint of their statement you're  telling us to chase a tail you claim to have already caught.

Too low of volume trading allows whales to fluctuate the price more easily since their buying and selling power then becomes a relatively higher percentage of the volume.

Probably because the price dipped 6% in two days.

...bitcoins purchasing power increasing doesn't make your watch worth more unless it's made of bitcoin.

You do know the market bounced back, right?

You don't put 100% of your investments into a single thing unless you're 100% about it's return.

That's literally what business is, though. Seeing an opportunity, and capitalizing on it.

Oh I know. Which is why I wanted to know his definition. 
I own some bit coin, because I believe in the philosophy of a currency not being controlled by government or the federal reserve. But I know it's extremely risky and volatile, and only have as much as I'm willing to have disappear overnight.

Fair. That being said google has been quite successful in a lot of things even if they weren't first to market : mail, search, video, ads, phone software, phone hardware, maps, browsers, cloud storage, payment, translation, ISP, translation, voice recognition, 3d drafting, blogs,  calendars and music all come to mine.

@_date: 2018-04-30 14:00:02
So, here’s the thing.

@_date: 2018-04-24 17:40:45
I think you mean why do bulls, idiot. 
@_date: 2018-04-12 15:55:38
Lol. Hype drives.

Ok. 
Either way, saved money is typically invested with the goal to beat inflation. 
@_date: 2018-04-30 02:11:40
Typically you invest saved money. 
You’re assuming people put it under their mattress.
