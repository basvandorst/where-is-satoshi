The business plan from the original prospectus Danny wrote had to be heavily adjusted and put into more details. expands on this.
Most of us who relocated came here specifically to build a  Bitcoin company.

BSA and the third money laundering directive supersedes any contract law or business transparency best practices/laws.
As a business you're strictly forbidden revealing your AML programs and customers asking specific questions about triggers and limits are considered red flags in themselves.
On the flipside, too strict AML programs/policies could potentially cause legal problems for the company in question.
The problem with AML and KYC laws are that is that it's a dynamic risk assessment of clients, which means for Bitcoin there's essentially no precedent on how to develop the AML programs. That could sway both ways. Too strict and you disrupt business operation and flow (unsatisfied clients) or not strict enough the company will have problems with the government.

I've personally seen his passport which was used to register the companies and so on. I doubt he went to the trouble to falsify a passport.

I think you're missing the point.
Creating a company is a massive undertaking on its own. Creating a "Bitcoin only company" can either be easier or harder.
Blockchain.info is such a company.
1. If you need to pay taxes to operate legally you will most likely need a bank account to pay said taxes. (Bitcoin is not legal tender)
2. Find a payment processor that accepts fiat to btc
I think your solution is to operate a company with a bank account, but to choose to keep most funds in Bitcoin some way.
If you don't want a bank account at all costs, there is no point in registering a company in the first place. (Keep in mind that might not be legal in most jurisdictions)

No, everyone resigned from their respective positions.
Most employees have moved on other things.

Danny was advised against releasing the prospectus at that time, as a lot of content was incorrect. Danny himself released it as is anyway.
Danny was already at that time looking for investments, but no more 'profit shares' were being issued.

No wallets/accounts were allowed to be opened or transact as part of the planned service. This is outlined in [this]( comment. Even though there were no customers of Neo &amp; Bee Bitcoin has still taken quite a hit reputationally, but most people here understands this was the doing of one person in one company and not the technology itself.
The MSc is a great initiative by the University of Nicosia. I'm very much looking forward to see the results of it.

The CFO has 100 % control and oversight of the accounting on the Euro side of things. Danny never surrendered control or gave insights to any bitcoin information to be used in accounting.
This was however requested multiple times, and promised by Danny.
@_date: 2014-04-18 15:50:39
This not correct. The old prospectus was not how the business was developed, as it clearly needed change. 
@_date: 2014-04-18 13:25:16
I don't know the extend of their involvement, but from what I understand from my former colleagues they were not auditing N&amp;B and should never have been mentioned in the prospectus at the time. Danny was in fact asked to remove it from the prospectus.
@_date: 2014-04-18 16:14:47
This is not solicitation for investment, nor would I advise anyone to assume liabilities connected to the group of companies.

The shock following that was pretty devastating, and he didn't show signs of plans to run away. We were focused on finding solutions to the problem in order to keep the company running under the circumstances.
At this point we have no idea what the status of potential remaining bitcoins as well as his claimed 6M ($/€/£) personal investment. This is part of what Danny has to account for, like in any other business accounting for their funds and assets.
@_date: 2014-04-18 11:57:43
I can't get into specific numbers, as I don't have them at hand. I would need to confirm with the CFO and his accounting.
But from memory it is in the range of 1.5M Euro

Neo &amp; Bee Ltd (CY) owns the domain and the content of the servers. Because we are no longer employed by the company, we don't know.

A program strictly only reporting to the relevant governmental agency/body (depending on jurisdiction) would not be sufficient to operate freely within the FATF area (BSA+local legislation), and the third money laundering directive (European Union + EEA). Those reports are mandatory though, but not on all transactions. I do agree that I'd externalize back onto the government as much as possible.
A company operating in a regulated industry (such as financial services) is obligated to have a proper AML program in place to acquire a license to operate.
For Bitstamp, they are somewhat piggybacking on the legacy banking policies, but they are however required to apply certain policies on the bitcoin side of things. This is most likely a requirement put on them by Unicred (their Slovenian bank partner).
This is why most Bitcoin companies struggling to find banking partners are struggling to begin with; the uncertainties of AML/KYC with bitcoins.
Audits are required when the company reaches a certain revenue threshold. The exact requirements varies between the European Union members. I'm not too familiar with all these requirements Europe wide (US law is irrelevant here, except for BSA)

The CFO was hired in mid November with no prior Bitcoin knowledge. While he has full control and accounting on the Euro side, he had a pretty steep learning curve in terms of the technology.
While we did request insights, this happened in the span of a very short time frame. With the amount of work on all the product and services Danny had in mind everyone was working all the time on these things, as well as many weekends.
@_date: 2014-08-04 19:33:56
They will not for AML/KYC reasons.
There are probably workarounds for this, but I'm willing to bet that it is too cumbersome to be worth it.
Financial service provider will need to operate with a legal entity or a natural person. Obviously you could sign up in your own name, if they allow it. But that will make you liable for a lot of things in your home country.
If your concern is that your operation will make it difficulty to acquire banking (let's say Colorado dispensaries) force Bitcoin or cash settlements. However if you don't think you'd face problems, but just rather want to avoid banking I suggest you use a bank account for strictly necessary tasks. Like paying taxes.
You wont be able to have it both ways and if you try you'll just face constant problems down the road.

1. The management team all opposed any opening of customer wallet/accounts because at the time of the opening (which most of us had concerns about) we were not ready operationally or software wise to handle customer transactions. What deals Danny did personally was outside the purview of the company and did not involve anyone else from the company.
2. Because there was nothing that suggested this behavior prior to the events outlined above. Most of the employees were not familiar with Bitcoin prior to this employment. Again, N&amp;B wallets/accounts were never allowed transactions. 
@_date: 2014-04-18 15:46:13
No, we did not claim that. These are accounts of what unfolded in mid march.
We had no authority to disclose information to the general public. The prospectus was released the day before Danny called a meeting, announcing lack of bitcoins, without our knowledge of its contents.
@_date: 2014-04-18 12:11:42
We no longer represent the company, and cannot speak with authority on this subject.
@_date: 2014-04-18 12:08:48
Danny claims to be an early adopter of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-04-18 13:27:46
I'm not sure if this is possible at this point. A new entity rising from the ashes of N&amp;B would need to change its approach a lot. For example focusing more on international services and online presence, rather than physically restricted to Cyprus.

Danny never refused to disclose and I was never supposed to address internal financial risk. I was asked specifically to address other types of business risks. As for CFO I've made comments elsewhere outlining this.

They are making their own statements about their opinions and their involvement. I recommend reading that for their full stories.

There were no early signs of him being untrustworthy. If that was the case most of us would have resigned months ago. I know I would have.
There's nothing that suggests that he set out to end the company like this. I don't know much about his past apart from what he told me and what little I could find online prior to making the decision to relocate to Cyprus.
@_date: 2014-04-18 23:36:32
Danny never held my bitcoins.
