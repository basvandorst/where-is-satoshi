You're aware that no money will be printed for UBI, right? So it will not be affecting national debt. No currency devaluation. No inflation because no increased supply.
A big chunk will come from 10% VAT tax (half the European level). Yes, it's a tax, but when you combine it with cash-in-hand of $1000/month for people to spend, it offsets the resulting price hike, in case tax is passed on to end-consumer, which not totally what happens in Europe. Only who spends over $120k/year will not break-even with UBI (top 7% of population).
Yang's UBI is opt-in. People on welfare will have to choose one or the other. Only those who receive less that 1k a month will make the switch. The advantage is that it's not means-tested. A majority of people in those programs prefer it.  [
Yang believes, and I agree, income tax is not the best way to capture money from the rich, as they're too smart to have taxable events. VAT is the most effective way of collecting that money, right at the consumption, on every transaction they make in the US. It's why most countries have a VAT, a tax on consumption.
If you look up the stats, most abortion decisions happen because of lack of resources to raise the kid.  [  UBI will help address that.
Check Yang's FAQ on UBI on his site. It's well done, and won me over.
Edit: grammar

There this graphic called "The 7 stages of Yang", look it up, I think you're between stage 1 and 3. Personally I went through them all. It's a journey :)
