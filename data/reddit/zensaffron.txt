If they mined honestly without attacking, the bitcoin block time would drop to ~3 minutes instead of ~10 minutes until the next difficulty change.  If they decided to stop mining after the difficulty change, the bitcoin block time would then be ~30 minutes.
If they did a 51% "attack", but still mined honestly by processing transactions normally, but ignoring the blocks of other miners, the bitcoin block time would be ~5 minutes instead of ~10 minutes until the next difficulty change.  If they decided to stop mining after the difficulty change, the bitcoin block time would then be ~20 minutes.

Look up Merkle Trees.  It involves pairing all the things, then hashing the pairs, then pairing all those hashes and hashing the pairs, so on until there's only one root hash.  This could go in the transaction.  Then to prove that a person's document is in the blockchain, all they need is the hashes in their branch of the tree and the transaction ID.  The branch size is log base 2 of the number of things that were timestamped.  So if you want to timestamp 1 billion things per transaction, the proof would be about 30 hashes for each document instead of 1 billion hashes.

The fee charged by exchanges as a % of each trade.  If you sell X bitcoin to yourself for $Y, you'll have less and less each time you do it because it'll be eaten up by fees.

I suspect, though I can't prove, that the links posted by /totes_meta_bot are being used by to sneakily promote their subreddit without suffering the consequences of vote manipulation.  It is basically a proxy to allow members to post in threads where they don't have to suffer any consequences for their comments.
All the members see a submission in their subreddit and check it out, then they see the post by and then upvote it like they would the regular submission.  This might just be done casually with no ill intent.  I assume that has had a history of "vote brigading" problems because I've seen prominent warnings there before.
To their credit, only allows np.reddit.com links.  This can be used by to block anyone coming from that link to not vote.  But this effectively does nothing because doesn't have that CSS enabled.

It'll be interesting how this plays out as the mining reward shrinks in BTC.  Dogecoin will be able to keep transactions cheaper longer, while BTC transaction costs will go up.  Dogecoin holders will subsidize dogecoin transactors through inflation, while bitcoin transactors have to pay the fees themselves.
This could appeal to the average person because the advantage of "low fees!" is simpler than deflation.

I wonder if miners will adopt a fee structure of X + Y% per transaction.  As bitcoin grows, the demand will increase fees for every transaction.  Bitcoin fees are already approaching paypal fees of $0.30.
The cost of processing a bitcoin transaction depends only on it's size in kilobytes because block size is limited.  As a spam reduction mechanism, miners have started looking at the age of the balance.  This gives older balances priority.  They did this to try and block quick transactions that they deem to have lesser value.  Older balance transactions are being subsidized by younger balance transactions.
In the future, to keep micropayments a feature, they might charge large transactions more to subsidize microtransactions.  If they started charging $0.01 + 0.01%, the bitcoin network would be able support transactions for a soda or bag of chips.  This would keep bitcoin branded as a "people's coin" rather than something only for the rich.
The fee on a 1 million dollar transaction would be $100.  The fee on a $2.50 transaction would be $0.01025.  (pulling the $0.01 + 0.01% numbers out of my ass)
In the end I hope the "people's coin" and "rich people's coin" are interlinked.  If bitcoin starts going down in value, the "rich people" might be willing to make concessions and pay a bit more to keep bitcoin attractive to the masses.

This is the real danger.  If Ghash has 51% and only includes it's blocks, ALL the other miners will earn nothing.  All the other miners will be faced with 
1. Trying to fight Ghash and work at a loss, 
2. Turn off their machines
3. Join Ghash and earn a profit.
Most will probably do   Then even if a competitor appears out of nowhere with an extra 40% hashing power, they will be forced to mine under Ghash.  Ghash becomes a black hole and then the only way to escape is for 51% of the miners to leave Ghash AT THE SAME TIME.

Like onetown said, other people would be buying and selling too.  If an exchange owner did it, they could only make the volume look bigger than it is.  While that's not directly altering the price, it is altering market data and could be used to manipulate traders.  If they wanted to move the price one way or another directly, they'd have to buy/sell other people's orders.  If someone noticed the price rose above their set sell price, and their order didn't get filled, they would notice and complain.
The exchange owner giving themselves special 0% fees is pretty bad, but what's worse is falsifying data entirely.  It is suspected that MtGox created $ out of thin air and then bought real bitcoins with fake $.  The only thing keeping that from happening is exchange audits to make sure they have everything they should.

A noble sentiment, but I worry about the practicalities.  It only works if every country embraces bitcoin at the same time.  If one country embraces it and loses control of their monetary policy, but another country rejects it, the country that rejected it gets the upper hand on the country that embraced it.  The country that rejected it can "raise" funds for an attack/defense much faster than the other country that has to do it the honest way.

I think the way Ghash operates is conflating two 51% issues.

Most of that is Ripple and is manipulated.
Instead of mining, Ripple created all the currency in the beginning and is passing them out instead of having people mine for it.  The true market cap of ripple is far far lower because the calculation uses the total amount created instead of how many have been passed out.  It'd be like using 21 million bitcoins for the bitcoin market cap calculation, when in reality only about half that have been mined.
If you don't believe me, look at the 24 hour volume.  Ripple has about 18% of Bitcoin's market cap, but it only has half a percent of the 24 hour volume:

The way I understand it:
Ripple is being marketed as a way to send USD (and other currencies) over the internet as easily as bitcoin.  What they don't make clear is that within the system there are many different kinds of USD and not all dollars are worth the same.
Let's say you bank at Chase Bank and you have $1 ChaseUSD in ripple.  Let's say that Chase Bank charges a 1% fee to withdraw the cash at an ATM.
Let's say your friend banks at Bank of America, and they have $1 BoAUSD in ripple. Let's say that Bank of America charges a 2% fee to withdraw the cash at an ATM.
If some online store accepts ripple USD as payment, the store might charge your friend more because it costs more for the merchant to cash out.  So the exchange rate between ChaseUSD and BoAUSD might not be 1:1.  The $1 that you have is worth more than the $1 that your friend has.

I think you're wrong about this.  Let's ignore the IOU part of Ripple for a moment.  XRPs can function just like BTC.  Anyone can create as many XRP addresses as they want anonymously, transactions are practically free and instant, and there will be a limited supply.
Ripples have another use that bitcoins don't: that they can be used to pay for transactions on the Ripple Network.  Ripples can do everything Bitcoins can do and more.  It is a premined altcoin with at least one extra feature (The IOU issuing and trading).  Ripple is absolutely a competitor to bitcoin.  I would argue that the "XRP:BTC is like stamps:gold" argument feels like a bait and switch to bitcoiners.


This is false also.  Why are the Ripple founders holding on to so many ripples?  The only way they plan to make money is by the rising value of XRP.  It is in their interests to have the value rise over time.  The conversion from XRP to USD can happen instantly in the Ripple network (as I understand it).  No one has to accept XRP for them to have value in this case.

I just mean in terms of market cap / mining support.  One of the reasons that litecoin wasn't attacked by bitcoin, is that bitcoin miners can't simply redirect their rigs to mine litecoin.  Peercoin also wasn't attacked by bitcoin or litecoin because it uses proof of stake.
One of litecoin's goals is to be asic resistant.  If this is true, then it means roughly 1 cpu = 1 vote.  If an altcoin is truly decentralized and aspires to the 1 cpu = 1 vote, then it's trivial to attack by litecoiners switching over temporarily.

Their website makes it sound like just a roundabout way of solving identity verification by creating a database of everyone and give them a PGP key that just also happens to be their bitcoin address(es).
If I go to grocery store and pay with cash, they don't need to see my driver's license.  If I go to gyft.com and buy a gift card with bitcoin, they don't need Coinvalidation's services.
If I go to coinbase and buy bitcoin, they need my identity.  If I go to bitstamp and sell bitcoin, they need my identity.  Is Coinvalidation just streamlining communication between coinbase and bitstamp so people don't have to reverify their identity?

I've been thinking about making a simple to use conversion site.  It'd enable instant coin payments from any cryptocurrency to any other cryptocurrency.
So if a person had namecoin, but wanted to pay with bitcoin, it'd look a bit like this:
Address to Send to: (1sfdlkjslkfjkdj) 
Amount: (0.01) BTC
Pay with: (Namecoin)
(Use exchange rates to calculate how many namecoin are due and generate namecoin address)
Please Send 0.0001 NMC to Nlkjsdflkjdfkjf.
Then once the user has sent the amount in NMC, send the corresponding amount of bitcoin to the address they entered.

I think you could argue that they don't actually exist.  They are centrally created, but there's a predefined limit.  People take that to mean there are already 100 billion XRP, but I see it as they **can create up to** 100 billion XRP and haven't yet.  The fact that they already exist in the code is only a byproduct of having a publicly provable limit.

I think this chart shows the opposite of what you want to say.  It shows BTC in terms of XRP, so if XRP goes down on this chart, it means it is out performing bitcoin.  If it goes up on this chart it means that it takes more XRP to buy 1 BTC.

Do both.  Pick an amount you're willing to lose.  Then put half in now and then half in later.  Or better yet, put a fourth in now, a fourth in next month, a fourth in the month after that and a fourth in the month after that.  That way you don't lose it all if the price tanks tomorrow.

I would add that the government's use of force is what stops these issues with fiat currencies.  Capital gains and income tax punshes everyone who doesn't use USD (in the U.S.).  This forces everyone to focus on one currency and that gives it the strength of the large infrastructure.  I think the only way to truly compete with fiat currencies is to give a cryptocurrency that stability voluntarily instead of by force.  That will probably only work if we all pick one cryptocurrency to focus on.
That's just my thinking anyway.

I think competition is good.  And I'm not yet convinced that any altcoin solves a major problem that bitcoin has.
I agree that there are small improvements that build upon bitcoin. But down the line there will be more small improvements to those small improvements.  I don't think it's good for cryptocurrencies to have to switch all your eggs into the newest basket just because it has a few improvements.  This will bring even more volatility to the cryptocurrency space and will have the same effect as inflation. In other words, these altcoins will capture some of the capital that bitcoin currently has and bitcoin's value will go down.
I think stability is a good trait to aim for, and the bigger the market cap, the more stable a coin's infrastructure will be (and hopefully price).  So for those reasons I like bitcoin and am not interested in altcoins for the time being and would not recommend them to my friends or family.

The mining subsidy is ~$360,000 per day based on 3,600 BTC/day at $100/BTC. So the fee that miners are earning is ~$7 per transaction.  
Does this mean that the electricity used to mine might increase until the subsidy is equal to the cost?

Why use LTC when the same thing can be accomplished with BTC alone?
If you and I want to mix our bitcoins, all we have to do is each pick an amount, then send them to eachother.  Only you and I have a record of that transaction.  The only person who knows the connection of my new coins to my old coins is you.
If you use a tumbler, then only the tumbler service has a record of it.
If you do it the LTC way, then only the bitcoin/litecoin exchange has a record of it.
The exchange doesn't claim to delete this information, where bitcoin tumbler services do say they delete it.

Be careful about switching Bitcoin from ASICS to Scrypt.  Peercoin is unique in that it uses proof of stake to back the currency's security.  The users who have the most to lose from an attack on the currency are those with the most ability to do so.
I would argue that ASICS mean that Bitcoin also has proof of stake, only not built into the code.  If you transition away from ASICS, you'll lose that proof of stake incentive.

The chance of governments simply outlawing bitcoin has always existed.  Remember the gold confiscation of 1933 in the US?
Besides, there is more than one government in the world.  If they all want to implement capital controls where you have to show your ID if you want to buy or sell anything, then bitcoin will be the least of our concerns.

This is a bit worrying because you aren't selling bitcoin, only allowing it as a payment option.  Are accepting Dwolla and Bitcoin going to be mutually exclusive?  Imagine if accepting Visa meant not being able to accept Mastercard.  I wonder if any US antitrust issues have arisen similar to this.

Would you rather them remove bitpay and any bitcoin option altogether?  What do you think they would do with their bitcoin if they accepted it directly?  Businesses have expenses.  Does your landlord accept rent in bitcoin?  Does your power company take bitcoin for your electricity usage?  Do you think all of their employees want to be paid in bitcoin?
I can't fault a business for accepting bitcoin through bitpay.  On an individual level is where you might be able to make these arguments, but not a business level.

Anecdotally, from being in bitcoin for years, when the price rises I feel like I got a bonus or won the lottery.  I'm not thinking about how my money will be worth more tomorrow.

Take a step back and look at that title.  
***Why dollars are better than bitcoins (and always will be)***
It really says something about how far Bitcoin has come when someone feels the need to defend dollars against bitcoins instead of just dismissing bitcoin.
And as for his arguments, see the comment by Dan Dascalescu.  Fees and micro-payments aren't ideological, they are hard facts.  He has no need for bitcoin in his life because he doesn't mind the fees and doesn't use micropayments.  That's fine, but there are people out there who do mind the fees they pay and do use micropayments. Bitcoin is for them.

Both of those transactions would be on the blockchain, but there would be 0 link between them.  They are effectively tumbled as long as neither of us tells anyone what we did.  Tumbling services do this many times to make it better.

Read a bit about the [Byzantine Generals Problem](  10 minutes was chosen deliberately to try and maximize the speed of transactions while minimizing wasted work by miners.  Coins that have a faster block time aren't automatically faster because the easier it is to mine a block, the easier it is to attack.  6 confirmations for bitcoin is more secure than 6 confirmations for a faster coin.

They want to have the amount of currency evenly distributed between each person.  This means your real life identity will be tied to your account and you will have to be verified using your government issued ID or passport.

Distributing wealth is always going to be a challenge with any system.  The already rich can just buy a lot to maintain their status.  The solution to that lies in government and taxation.
I think your figures are a bit misleading though.  Services like MtGox, Bitstamp, Coinbase, and even the Bitcoin Investment Trust all store a bunch of user's bitcoins in a few addresses and cold storage.
