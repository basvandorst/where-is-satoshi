Totally agree but Rome wasn't built in a day. I believe it was Wiston Churchill  that said " Never let a crisis go to waste " The next financial crisis Bitcoin needs to show how it can be a better Gold of the future.Its a hell of a lot easier to carry $100000 in Botcoin than $100000 in gold. That's where I see Bitcoin thriving not as a every day payment option but a store of value.

Good read I jumped down the rabbit hole a year ago so most of the information was redundant but for someone that hasn't jumped yet it is a great article.

That's the problem with this country the majority of the population don't even know what the federal reserve is and what it does. If you would choose to keep your money in only dollars your crazy. The dollar loses 3 to 4 percent a year. Say goodbye to 35 percent in ten years
