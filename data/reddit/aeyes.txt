There are no working, universally programmable, quantum computers. If you are about to shout D-Wave, let me tell you that it can't run the algorithms needed to mine Bitcoin or to break SHA256. Its not universally programmable, its architicture only allows it to calculate a very limited set of problems.

Something isn't quite right here, the Reichsmark was introduced in the mid 20s. Before that inflation was driven by paying off the debts owed for WW1.

No data about network difficulty or anything protocol related at all?
The exchange rate has the least to do with Bitcoin ittself...

I wouldn't trust a government controlled system. Even if you can initialize the card yourself (get the private key onto it) they can probably read and use it easily.

To digitally sign, for example, a PDF you need a private key. And if the private key is on a government issued card they can read it (if they didn't already store it when issuing the card) and "forge" your signature.
Authenticating yourself with the card is something else entirely and not what I'm criticizing in my post. But essentially it suffers from the same problem because the private key for authentication is on the card and the government might have it.
Public Key auth and signing is a powerful tool, but only if the private key is in our own hands.

The attack really only makes sense for a file into which you can insert arbitrary data somewhere to change the hash output while still getting your rogue content out in working order.
Any arbitrary data inserted into source code would be easily spotted.
I think its more interesting to modify binaries like a wallet software without anyone noticing. I can think of a couple of documents/binaries were a modification that cost $5M would still be worth it.

This is plain out wrong. Only very small shops don't accept cards because of the fees.
It is true that many don't accept credit cards. Thats because we have the EC (Electronic Cash) debit card. Everybody with a bank account gets this card and it can be used almost everywhere.
Credit cards aren't commonly used because a lot of banks charge additional fees if you want one. Store owners also have to pay higher fees. And it adds almost no benefit compared to the EC card unless you need a credit.

First of all, the average price is around .25ct/kWh.
The renewable energy surcharge is a big part of the cost (.6ct/kWh). It is used to pay everybody who generates renewable energy. For example for solar you currently get .12ct for every kWh you produce and the network operators are obliged to buy it. It exists to motivate people to build renewable energy sources and works pretty well, you can basically build a PV array for free. In my opinion it is a small price we pay for a large benefit down the road.
Another .6ct/kWh are taxes.

Very specific steps...
Like using the privacy-browsing feature of your browser. Its two clicks away, people in this sub should know how this works.
If you have an account on a site which you use regularly you voluntarily give away your privacy. The decision what you use it for is still yours.

Try Eclipse with Stratum.
It will notify if miners go down, even SMS notification is possible.
Also: Less fees than BTC Guild.

So 3 months breakeven at current BTC price with 0.15 USD/kWH and difficulty rise calculated in. Thats not too bad.
If you stashed your coins 2 years ago you can now even make a profit when cashing out by selling these...

Wait? She doesn't work? Well whats to worry about, its not her money by any means. Thats what I hate about being married. You earned it so you can spend it.
Even if she goes to school she can work part time, even if its for 500 Euros. THEN she can complain about you spending money.

I'm going to answer this for the ones that are interested: There would be central nodes (stationary) which are connected to each other (internet, VPN).
Since bitcoin transfers are no good without signatures from the network you'd need an uplink anyway.

how are you going to get the usual subscription model going that adult sites have?
@_date: 2013-04-13 00:43:31
15 THash/s is 20% of the networks hashing rate. Yet they are completely invisible: 
With 15TH/s you're probably solo mining but I think I remember that they use BTC Guild which makes no sense to me. Also, the fastest user on BTC Guild is 8TH/s

passpack.com (an online password storage service) has developed this technique several years ago. For the more interested people, they have open sourced their libraries: 
I bet this code is used at blockchain.info.

I believe the idea is that people are too lazy to cancel the subscription.

Think again about the ASIC PCIe mining cards, I'm sure someone other than BFL will jump onto that format as well.

In my hometown we have a 500+ node wifi ad-hoc (mesh) network. I have worked a bit on the routing protocol (OLSR-NG).
This technology is far from working in a stable manner. If you have too many nodes it will crash, if you don't have enough it won't work. The routing is unstable and the routing protocol cannot handle more then a couple of thousand nodes. We use WiFi which has more processing and transmission power, bigger antennas and is stable in location. The routing protocol is highly optimized but requires a lot of CPU. A mesh with such small devices is impossible in the next 15 years at least.
Also, it only starts working if you have a million devices out there. Nobody is going to buy it for a lot of money if it depends on others buying it as well. By the time the network works the technology is outdated. The WiFi AP you can use for other things if the mesh doesn't work.

no, i think 3.10 is the release date of the updated php package (10th of march)
PHP 5.3.6 is old but as all distributions, Ubuntu backports security fixes. The -13 is the Ubuntu patch release number.

I haven't seen hardware or infrastructure exploits in a long time and I work in this area. Its probably much easier to find some software bugs through fuzzing or to social engineer your way in.
Also, the anouncement is more about delivering some buzzwords. For example, a direct link to Akamai is not possible, there is no such product. They can have something like Akamai Site Shield, doesn't protect them from Origin DDoS though.
Also, I laugh at companies who think they are safe behind Akamai WAF or Cloudflare. There are uncachable requests on all sites with logins so its possible to DDoS them at will. You have to specifically craft the DDoS requests but that takes 10 minutes if you know what you're doing. With enough Source IPs, good DDoS target URLs and clever randomization of requests its possible to DDoS any site through Akamai or Cloudflare.

If I was you, I would check this: 
They actually have the PCBs, the Avalon sample chips and everything. I would be surprised if their prototype doesn't run as intended. Check their HiRes pics, this looks solid.
This is the most promising Avalon based approach that I have seen so far.

Lets assume 50% of the network gets taken down because ASICMINER is raided. Difficulty will readjust within two weeks and mining will get 50% easier.
Mining is only computationally expensive because of the difficulty factor. Signing the transactions alone is not what makes it hard to mine.

Do you have a magic solution for Garbage Collection or why would you consider Java for low latency software?
10s stop-the-world is common for Full GC. Yes you can try to avoid ever running Full GC but you can't be sure...
