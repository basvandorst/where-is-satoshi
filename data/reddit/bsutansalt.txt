Correct. I may have started out as a currency, but it's transformed into a store of value. Digital godl if you will.

I have a small pot of money to buy at 10500 and flip for 11500 over the next couple days until the Long futures expire. On the 24th I'm setting buys at 8900 and 9100 for Bloodbath Part 2. That money is what I'm going to ride to $25,000 late this year.

Was he just dollar cost averaging?
@_date: 2017-12-27 17:12:08
You're not alone. I made a $100 deposit on the 18th and again on the 20th. Both were processed by my bank, but still haven't hit my USD account. When I checked earlier they still show as "pending". 
I actually bought some bitcoin direct from them before I knew about ACH, that purchase STILL hasn't hit my account (it's listed as pending for 12/30).

So basically 1 trade per day for free? That's insane! Helloooo day-trading.
@_date: 2017-12-28 03:40:58
Then the dollar must be doing better seeing as BTC just dipped into the 13000s :/
@_date: 2017-12-30 16:25:22
Yes. Big retracements are indicative of bubbles in the market. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 15:51:56
Bingo. I got burned by this once as well. Oh well, time to hold.

Just look at what happened in 2008. Hell, that's one of the main reasons BitCoin was created. The crash demonstrated a need for an alternative. 9 years later and here we are.
@_date: 2017-12-27 23:38:26
That's about $26,000,000 based on current numbers. Wow. It's like realizing you had a winning lottery ticket years after you threw a bunch away.

It's been playing hopscotch with 16K for 4 hours now. I just want my limit order to go through!

$1000 or $1000?

How does Bitstamp compare to Binance and Gemini? 
Look at the ratings here they seem to be about the same.
I'm considering leaving Coinbase for Binance or Bisq. Sell me on Bitstamp and why I should use it.
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:42:30
Gemini is only 0.25% per trade???? Coinbase is 1.5%. Holy cow that's cheap.  With Gemini being that cheap why would anyone stay with Coinbase or GDAX? What's the catch?
@_date: 2017-12-27 02:03:47
That was a great video. Thanks for that.
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:03:08


Guilty. I'm trying to learn though.
@_date: 2017-12-30 22:20:57
Nope. I'm stubborn and I do think the price will go back up again, even if it takes a couple years. 
Lee and others are speculating BTC will be somewhere between $30,000 and $100,000 by the end of 2018. Even if their most conservative estimates fall flat and it only goes up half that much, that still puts us at $20,000 again (assuming it levels out at $10,000). Personally I'll be surprised if it hits $20K by 2020, let alone at the end of the year, so I'm buying as much as I can afford in the meantime. There's no telling where the bottom will be, so every major drop it makes I'm buying what I can.
@_date: 2017-12-29 12:54:28
It feels like every time I check on it it's down another 20% from the ATH.
I was told I would make money.  /Milton
@_date: 2017-12-31 07:13:11
I'm noticing this as well. Each crypto has their own bull cycle, retraces, then generally goes flat thereafter. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:37:07
Not after this fiasco. Ally just backed out and more may follow.
@_date: 2017-12-31 08:00:48
10-12K is where I expect it to settle for the next couple months
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:38:54
And that's how you dollar cost average. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 16:09:20
Maybe so, but the history of bitcoin's value swings supports me. Just go look at the YTD and all time values. Bubble. Burst.
It's certainly **not** the end for BTC, but there's no telling where the drop will stop, let alone recover its losses.  
Until that happen I think now is a good time to buy. Every time it drops 10% I'm personally buying more when I have the cash.
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:08:16
Exactly. Hold on to what you've already got and think of the rest just going on sale!
@_date: 2017-12-28 05:32:16
Are we all going to agree that this is the cause of the ~18% dip over the last 2 days?
@_date: 2017-12-30 15:49:28
Look at the cycle. This is hardly tbe first time this has occurred. 
The big question is where does  the cratering stop? It's anybody's guess. edit: after a deep dive into BTC's performace, I'm predicting a $9000-12000 market for the next two quarters. Granted it's bitcoin so who really knows. It's own past history is really the only thing we have to go by at this point in time.
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:50:01
Bought back at just under $14,000. And now it's down another 10% :(
@_date: 2017-12-30 15:50:51
The high price is more to do with the flood of speculative retail traders.
@_date: 2017-12-30 16:13:07
Go back further from the last month. When the runup began THAT was the start. Retrace the value before that. Its roughly 40% devaluation. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:05:14
Thanks for this. And Electrum it is. Plus I'm already in the process of getting set up with Gemini as well thanks to some good advice in another thread. I still can't get over how much cheaper they are for trades than Coinbase.
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:01:24
Thanks, I'll check this out tonight.

I found this earlier tonight when I was googling coin market cap because I brain farted the name:
So far so.good
@_date: 2017-12-30 15:59:11
Your description of pump &amp; dumping is spot on. As for it getting up to 20K, I guess we'll see. I think it will, even if it takes 4-5 years to recoup the losses like the stock market did following the 2008 crash. Granted the cryptocurrency market is far more volatile, so it could manage to pull it off within the year **if** something significantly positive happens that drives people to high volume trading again. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 22:17:33
When I started this thread by saying crash, I was talking about the bubble bursting like it did. Personally the whole thing reminds me of the 2008 crash from the stupid sub-prime mortgage fiasco. As for what inflated BTC's value so  much this past year it's a matter for another thread, but I will not be at all surprised if the price continues to retrace down towards where the price started accelerating in Q1 2017. A more realistic stopping point to the hurt will be the $10000-12000 range if past performace is any indication of how the market will behave.
@_date: 2017-12-30 23:58:12
It's good advice, but at the same time if you'd invested when he said not to, AND PUNCHED OUT AT the afternoon/evening of Dec 17th, you'd have still seen a 100% gain. The tricky part is gauging where the bubble is about to burst, and then GTFO laughing all the way to the bank.

Wait. What fork?

I've got to say this is weird. I've been subbed/lurking here for quite a long time and never expected to see TRP linked here. It actually kind of amuses and impresses me how far and wide TRP principles can influence people and knock guys out of their stupor of being beholden to women's sexuality so they can make sound decisions for a change. Take the OP, completely wrapped around the axle with his gf and can't understand why he's getting some of the responses he is here.

Close. A marriage is a contractual agreement between the two people and the state. For some reason people forget that the state is the 3rd wheel to every single marriage in existence (at least in the US).

Translation: took the woman off the pedestal I've put them on, treated her like a human being, called her out on her bullshit (becoming a bit of a challenge myself), and wasn't a sniveling simp. HOLY CRAP women want to have sex with me now!

Did you read them? They don't back up your claims in the slightest. Doubly so when you examine their context. I'm going to go out on a limb and guess you're a blue pill troll/SRS type who cannot be reasoned with.

And nice bit of quote *mining* you did there. Too bad you don't include the rest of the threads so folks can understand them in their proper context, like sometimes guys need to vent their frustrations or are being tongue in cheek. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 15:46:58
Agreed. I'm dollar cost averaging now with stong holds as high as 16,700. Every $1,000 drop I'm buying more with the hope it goes to the moon like guys like Tom Lee are predicting.
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:56:22
I  stand  corrected. I thought those fees cited upthread were for GDAX. I can't check for myself because their damn website is still returning 404 errors for their fees page.
@_date: 2014-05-22 11:22:27
TIL taking woman off their pedestal, treating them like human beings, and calling them out on their bullshit like anyone else is "abuse".

Sooooo move your coins off the exchange and into a hardware wallet. Okay if you intend to hold long term I guess. My question is....
Is there some event coming up I don't know about?
@_date: 2018-02-12 05:35:29
Lee also said it could go down to $20 and people should be okay with that over the long term. I suspect he saw the crash/correction coming and bailed while the getting was good.
