My initial verification as a  US resident with a card I have had for several years took two weeks with Circle . After one week I emailed support and they said I had been caught in the fraud detection system. Just email if you want them to expedite your verification.

Love the idea. One thing to consider is that even though sending them an address seems like it makes things easier, you may want to just say, "make an account on [insert website here] and I will send you $[insert amount here] in BTC". 
Also do have a short introduction to get them excited about BitCoin. Mention things like there are certain places that offer discounts and that they are now an early adopter of what is the future of money. 
Looking forward to hear how this goes for you!

There is no description on the [SoChain website]( (the API used on the backend of CryptoVal), so I sent an email to the support line to get specifics about the "pending threshold". You will hear back when they have responded.
