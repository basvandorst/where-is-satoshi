this one looks smooth! thank you! will be fun to use coinb.in to recover money from coinkite / bitgo / etc and vice versa just because ...

Thanks for the pointer, not boring at all, I will read up on it..
@_date: 2014-12-22 22:28:05
great! Will installing the firmware require recovery? :--)

This is quite the solution, even when the gut turns while wiping your trezor, having unreasonable doubts that your seed might fail :-)

Anyone a user of greenaddress or bitgo multisig? are there more providers / software?

How save is a 12 word seed? Mine is burned into my brain, I'll never forget it. Just have to find a way to pass the seed on to family in case I "move on" ..

This i great! I hope other wallet services would use this to proof that you can get your coins out in case they go under ...
(on a side note I upvoted you and you lost that vote instantly again, is that normal?)

any service with SEPA, most have it, e.g. kraken, bitstamp etc .. or localbitcoins on location

does too buggy mean you have money stuck in it that you can't get out?

Thank you for your awesome response!

amazing, I'll wait for it then, will you announce it on reddit once available?

How do you use coinkite? with "for that" do you mean the same scenario I described above, cosigning with your phone? How? Pardon my ignorance, genuinely interested to learn more how coinkite works, it looks very powerful and I haven't grasped all of its features yet .. there are limitations with free accounts?

This article claims that Target accepts bitcoin, is that a typo / confusing with tiger direct or actually true?

Looks too much like the Euro, which already looks like play money. Let's not copy the establishment but solve a problem through good designs. Maybe we should have a lighthouse campaign for an epic bitcoin note design?

ANX says they have no fee, but they quote me $287 for buying bitcoin or $251 for selling bitcoin, that's a 12.5% fee for spending your btc when you use their debit card. In the interview the CEO uses an Amazon purchase as an example for using his debit card, but he of course doesn't mention that your amazon purchase just got 12.5% more expensive or that you could buy an amazon giftcard at egifter and save 3-10% depending on their promotion when you buy the giftcard .. not a fan of these hidden fees. Still, a debit card that tops up from or draws from btc would be awesome, but the conversion price needs to be reasonable.
edit: For now it is more profitable and anonymous to sell your btc at a premium on localbitcoins and then purchase a prepaid credit card (mind the $5 fee for that), so not necessarily more convenient ..

12.5% fee, check out my comment below

Thank you for the opportunity to ask questions, I'm pro btc debit cards but would like to understand your product better.
* If I have your debit card and want to top it up with bitcoin, what is the exact procedure and conversion rate? 
* I imagine the debit card has a QR code on the back and you simply scan it to top it up at the current market rate, but that is probably not the case?
* So I first have to set a limit order, wait for it to fill, and then move the dollar into the debit card?
* If the current bid is $251 on ANX and I set a limit order of the actual market price of $286 I might have to wait a very long time for that order to fill and it might never happen .. 
* Is this large spread because your exchange's volume is too low that no one is currently willing to buy at a higher quote?
* Do you make any profit on trades / spreads or only from fiat withdrawals?
Thank you very much for answering these questions ..

does coinbase charge you the 1% fee for converting your btc into usd in the moment of purchase? Would be better to use circle, their higher exchange rate would give you more $ for your btc when you go shopping ..

So I can walk into a store and buy a prepaid visa card in cash.. where is my anonymous BTC debit visa card? Let me buy a prepaid visa card in btc or cash with a QR code on the back to top it up and ready to go, why do KYC / AML on a bitcoin debit card but none of the above on a prepaid visa card?

thanks for sharing, so you download a signing request file from coinkite to your phone and then use the olsign.html file in your phones browser to open that json file and cosign it with your passphrase? I wish there was something half way between copay and coinkite in terms of complexity and features .. note to myself: copay is opensource, oh my, stop complaining and start coding ...
@_date: 2015-04-01 21:28:56
Quite spiffy, thank you, my first tip :-)
This is the bitcoin killer app: Pay customers for reporting support issues / complaints / bug reports (and then fix them)!
I was frustrated before, now a tip and a coinbase reponse later, I'm Zen!

Why stop accepting a payment method that is already setup, has no processing cost and that people are enthusiastic about ? Gimme a break, it'll cost them money to take it down, instead of making money by keeping it up .. This is disappointing.
Did someone reach out to them for comment ?
@_date: 2015-04-01 21:53:58
This! You're my personal hero for the day, haven't even thought of this. Fixed the problem for me, thanks again!

Great! Would be great to meet you if it works out, don't care what movie character you look like ☺
I'm flying in 10:20am and have 8 hours overlay. What would be the best way to get downtown and back in time?

which other similar projects to look out for then?
@_date: 2015-09-25 20:51:57
Thanks John, do I have the option with your plugins to receive the btc into my xpub key directly, so if coinbase is down or has issues I'm independent and my store stays operational? basically code that lives on my server and splits the payment between coins I want to keep in a wallet to which I have the keys and coins that go to coinbase for processing to USD ..

very cool, thanks ! I'm looking for something I can click-activate in 5 minutes right now but maybe I'll find the time and cook my own solution ...

thanks, I have only dabbled with WP before, haven't become the biggest fan yet, seems like they have regular security issues? Or is my perception skewed? Looks like it depends on block.io wallet, if they go, will my btc as well? Thanks a lot, I'll check it out ..
@_date: 2015-09-25 22:09:49
I wonder what it takes to build a strong community around those projects to get external contributions, I'd certainly would help if I new which issues to tackle ..

I just want to let you know how much I appreciate the work you guys put into those projects, they are truly awesome. Will development on them slow down or will the pace be the same?

So how do they pull of the 10% discount in their brick and mortar store? Shouldn't the police be coming in to knock on their door on a daily basis if they are using carders to by themselves the items they sell in the store?

1.) If you hold bitcoin in an exchange / third party you are not holding bitcoin
2) Your description of btc loss sounds like fraud / theft. The definition of *to seize* as alleged to by OP:
    to take possession of by legal authority; confiscate:

I get paid in dollars and taxes are automatically withheld from my paycheck, so I usually get a refund and don't have to pay additional. If I were to sell / trade bitcoins and my capital gains tax were to exceed my refund I would have to sell BTC for USD to pay tax.
I use a credit card to pay for things non-bitcoin-payable and pay off the credit card every two weeks when I get a paycheck, the remainder gets converted into bitcoin.
I have a cafe and a restaurant in my town that accept bitcoin natively. For Amazon etc I wait for a promotion on egifter and then by a giftcard, the last promotion was 10% off !!
I will stop working soon and travel around the world, this is where it gets interesting :-)

I tried this multiple times now, I can create a wallet, but I cannot log in again with the trezor afterwards. Everytime I use the trezor to log in the website tells me no account was found and instead a new account gets created, it's a vicious cycle, I sure have plenty of accounts now :-) Love how the app pops up on the phone though when you plug the trezor in!! Just can't do anything with it until I figure out how to log into the accounts I created using the trezor, any ideas ?
