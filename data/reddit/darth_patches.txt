So you want anarchy?
You also didn’t answer the question, which makes me think you don’t know how to answer the question and will just react frothing at the mouth in rage again.

No, I’m not and that is called a strawman, thought we were avoiding fallacies? Well you are a complete fool, sounds like you just don’t want to live in a society.

You’re fucking stupid if you think dem policies are meant to be given for free. Look at the actual proposed legislation you dumb twat and you will see the taxes mentioned to pay for said policy. No intelligent person believes dem promises would be “free”.

You are a complete fool.
@_date: 2019-04-20 13:56:26
Yes you do, bitch.
@_date: 2019-04-20 14:00:47
I hate that you can’t spell lol. Answer my question bitch.

Dude... are you dumb? My entire second paragraph explains why I like democracy. How is democracy based on violence? 
I am on the bitcoin sub because I believe in the power of the blockchain and I want to make money off bitcoin. 
I am asking you, what system of government is better than democracy and you are too much of a bitch to say what you think.
@_date: 2019-04-20 15:04:58
Mob rule meaning majority rule? Name a better system than democracy.

Because your friend can buy btc without dealing with your bitch ass.
Also, more importantly, there is no legal mechanism to resolve disputes where you fuck each other over. What’s stopping you from not actually sending the btc over?

Suck my dick then answer my question. Also, what’s the fallacy? That democracy is the best form of government mankind has created? Yes, that is my belief, but it is not mistaken. 
Democracy gets you the government you deserve, all other forms of society give the people no voice at all or any opportunity to advance. That doesn’t mean our current form of democracy with such a powerful executive is democracy in its best form. Or the fact that votes can suppressed / Gerrymandered to favor a certain party (mostly republicans in the us). 
Now, what form of civilization is better than democracy in your opinion and why?
@_date: 2019-04-20 13:51:35
I think you are a liar.
@_date: 2019-04-20 13:52:53
Dude, why are you acting like having your friends pay your bills is a normal/adult thing to do? Sounds annoying as fuck to your friends.
