It's insane to think the general public would support an obscure altcoin before it supports Bitcoin. If Bitcoin fails, it doesn't matter how superior an altcoin actually is, Joe Public ain't never gonna jump on board. If Bitcoin fails the only crypto-currency Joe Public will ever use is centralized national currency because it's forced to. So don't be dumb, support Bitcoin.

Once I had $19.98 in my bank account. I inserted 2 pennies in an envelope at the machine and withdrew my $20. No joke. Then went straight to the bar.
@_date: 2014-10-01 12:00:56
No way Joe Public supports an altcoin before it supports Bitcoin. And Joe Public is what crypto needs.

NOOB alert - apology in advance:
Please advise me how to properly include transaction fees with transactions to my own wallets. Do I need to include it on the receiving end also? Or just add the extra bit when I am sending.
Also what is an appropriate amount? 0.0002?
Thank you

Thank them. Send them love. For their darkness is poison and they are damned, oh funnybunny proclaims. It is because of their greed BITCOIN was brought forth unto us.

sweet angel child, that cuckold on the throne of "great" britain is the most powerful woman in the world. all heads of state grovel beneath her steely iguana gaze. the golden royal chariot alone is worth 370 BILLION dollars of gold. she could feed the planet, yet she'd rather let her cousin of a husband fondle little boys as she defecates in the "throne" room

If you think the general public is going to support an even more obscure altcoin before it does Bitcoin you're insane.

The world needs Bitcoin. And the world needs Russia. Without Russia, NWO lackeys USA and EU could move in for their endgame with no resistance (except for China maybe). Russia has it's place, and it can't adopt Bitcoin for a reason. 
But fear not Bitcoin will reign in the lackeys.

It was cited as a selling point because banks don't want immutability. As soon as it forked they knew they had found their man.

So you claim to be an educated person, but you didn't educate yourself on Bitcoin while caught in the hype of a bubble. That I can forgive. What I can't forgive is, you besmirched the honey badger in front of all your friends. Shame on you. Good thing honey badger don't care.

It's not that I don't think bitcoin doesn't work the same as before, I just personally don't care as much as I used to. I got in for ideological purposes, then slowly learned TA and realized I could trade. As I said I only lost 10% of my stash, and the honeymoon is over, but I am alive and prosperous.  Yet there will be no more late nights trying to convince my friends it's the greatest thing on earth.  Bitcoin doesn't care what I think so it doesn't matter anyway. I think $5000 bitcoin is still possible by next halving.
@_date: 2016-09-03 12:21:28
Fuck no. I only lost 10% of my total bitcoin stash, but my virgin butthole was raped, and I no longer find bitcoin even that interesting. I now prefer reading r/buttcoin cause the posts are smarter. Fuck bitfinex to fucking hell and back.

It is being tested. However you wouldn't know it from just reading this forum. But as has been shared on the "other" forum, Bitcoin has specifically done something that Ether has not. It has stood the test of time. This doesn't mean it is invincible or will never be superseded. While the Ether hype remains high, it will draw in the "hot money" from traders, and also shake the weaker hands out of Bitcoin. Perhaps, and hopefully, this will speed up development from the Core side of things. Because we need it. With blocks at full capacity it appears that we have reached the price limit of Bitcoin in the 450ish range. With the halvening approaching it would be nice to feel confident that an increase in transactions would confirm across the network.
