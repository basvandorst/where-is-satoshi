If you calculate CPI using the same rules that the government did back in 1980 or 1990, the rate is closer to 10%. The current adjustments to the CPI calculation have some pretty obvious results.

my problem with r/bitcoin is that I had some legitimate questions that weren't easily found, but instead of a few upvotes so I could get some exposure and possibly get find some answers, I get a few comments no upvotes and a few downvotes.
2-3 three people max see my question, usually just to tell me they also would like to know the answer, and then nothing.
r/bitcoin from my experience is severely broken. 
@_date: 2013-11-05 01:24:19
my normal strategy is to dollar cost average in by buying about the same amount once a month.
however I've been thinking maybe I should gamble with 10 or 20 bitcoins this time around. Perhaps by setting 2 sell points ahead of time, sell 10 btc at $300 and another 10 btc at $350 if this run up reaches that high. Then if the price drops back to the $200's I turn the profit back into more bitcoins.
I don't know if I have the stomach to really try and time the market though, just thinking out loud.

lol, no it's a lot of money for sure but I meant services like dwolla have limits that made transferring 10k too much of a pain. I don't recall the details the last time I checked out dwolla, but isn't it like $800 a day max or something?
my partner and I are both professionals with good incomes and we're diligent savers. putting $40k into gold, or $10k into bitcoins to hedge our investments is a big deal even if those amounts are only a small percentage of our overall portfolio. that hardly makes us 1 percenters, more like barely upper-middle class.

@_date: 2013-03-25 21:08:32
take the total you want to invest over the next 3 months and average it in every 2 weeks or so. 
if it corrects, you end up with more bitcoins total. If it doesn't correct, you ended up with more bitcoins than if you waited 3 months to get in. win win, but keep in mind this mitigates your potential losses, and potential profits.
edit: decide on a plan and stick to it. otherwise letting our emotions sway your strategy usually ends in bad news.

similar situation to the US. individual state budgets are fucked. I live in california, as usual we are leading the charge in who can go bankrupt the fastest.
while california, or spain, can't print it's own money, the feds/ecb are printing money and then loaning/giving it to them to keep them solvent. California/Spain then don't address their fiscal issues and keep spending like crazy. They use both sides, more taxes and handouts from big bro.
inflation is still happening in California &amp; Spain, and getting worse, regardless of them being the actual money printers or not.

inflation is also the reason we work so much. in the 50's, if we didn't have inflation the increase in productivity over the years would mean that most of us would only need to work 5 hours or less per week to earn the same amount someone back then did in 40. Thanks to inflation, 2 people working a combined 80 hours still don't make as much, and somehow we are over 10x more productive in worker output too.

is it legal to do *any activity* in the U.S.
the answer is always: No, there are innumerable regulations, permits, laws, fees, and restrictions on doing that activity.

I can't remember the exchange rate because I bought them with bitcoins and not usd, but the USD/LTC rate was $0.67. It's been up and down between $2.50 and $4.50 since then. I have almost 800 litecoins that are worth several thousand dollars, I believe the LTC/BTC ratio has gone up too.
but I'm not doing a short term investment in litecoin so I haven't cared to figure out the actual numbers. Maybe I would have made more money on bitcoin, but in 5+ years I'm hoping bitcoins are worth $5000+ and litecoin is worth $1000+. A tiny bit of diversification :)

the rising price encourages businesses to accept bitcoin, especially since it's really easy to have the prices automatically adjust.
seller sells coffee pot for 1 bitcoin ($30). The next day the bitcoin that he hasn't cashed yet is worth $32. winning!

if you are looking long term, then it's not a huge consideration. I think the fundamentals are there, and bitcoin will be worth a lot more in 5-10 years.
I do think there will be a bit of a correction, but will it happen now or at $250 or $500? Who knows.

bitfloor got back to me and said their bank takes the fees out after the transfer happens, so it shouldn't mess up.
crossing my fingers and going with bitfloor. didn't want to use okpay, but still a little nervous about bitfloor since there isn't any account info sent along with the transfer, just the amount identifies my account.

since it's not public knowledge how they store a users bitcoins, it's safe to say we can't evaluate the safety of storing bitcoins with them versus the other methods.

i think bitcoin and other technologies will eventually render governments as they are today pointless.
we don't need imaginary lines on a map telling us where we can live or work or visit. we don't need endless millions of rules and regulations to interact with each other. we don't need endless war to protect the interests of the powerful few. we don't need big government.

I deal in larger amounts, so I've never used the cash options. A bank wire to bitfloor takes 2-3 business days. The fees are fixed, and only make sense for larger amounts &gt;2-3k in my opinion.

i'm not a graphic designer/artist, but I do work in the webdev world. I'd assume in the 4-8 hour range, maybe longer if there is a feedback round. Hard to say because usually a business is either specific in what they want (and then want it tweaked once what they want is delivered), or they want options to choose from and then tweaking of that choice.. Just explaining why my time estimate is extremely inaccurate.
good graphic artists make anywhere from $50/hr on up. b2b charges can easily be $150/hr and up, depending on who you are hiring.
for a contest it's probably fine, but I wouldn't expect to get blown away. you aren't stealing away a pro from a real project is what I'm poorly communicating.

personally, unless there is a compelling need to have something custom designed, I'd go the prepaid theme route. If your blogging software supports themes, chances are you can find a great looking skin/theme whatever you want to call it for $20-50.
weebly is also super easy and has tons of great looking themes, but if you are already hosted somewhere and have chosen a blogging framework probably not an option.

since there is a known maximum number of bitcoin we should denote a megabitcoin as being the total maximum number of bitcoin that can ever be. 
1 btc = 0.00000004761905 megabitcoin
$1 kilodollar ~= 1 btc ~= 47.6 nanoMegabitcoin (NMB)

I'm debating increasing that number to 2-5%. I starting buying when bitcoins were in the mid $20's. I've made good money so far but trying to not make any emotional decisions.

how do you plan to address the problems that come from our corrupt centralized state? Wildly increasing inflation from money printing and excessive debt based spending? Unending wars? Corruption at every level leading to a police state? The great recession?
@_date: 2013-04-11 03:12:28
to further the analogy, google plus (like litecoin) is doing a respectable second. In both areas there are a few distant competitors for 3 &amp; 4th, but nothing to factor in when looking at the big picture.
until another technology comes along that is much better, we're stuck with facebook and bitcoin. in the social arena there is a decentralized version that I hope catches on (i hate facebook) called diaspora, we'll see.
bitcoin is already decentralized, so unless new tech comes along that vastly improves upon bitcoin, it's going to be the front runner for a while.

i briefly considered selling a portion, maybe speculating with 10% of my holdings. but timing the market is too much stress, I think i'll just sit back and keep dollar cost averaging in and see if bitcoin as a long term bet pays off. So far I'm up without playing the market at all.
my next scheduled time to buy bitcoins isn't until mid November, we'll see what the price is then.

I doubt that will protect you. The government is likely to make up new rules as it sees fit from year to year, and can also make those rules retroactive. I doubt the taxes you paid will satisfy those rules, reduce your penalties, or prevent you from being thrown in jail.
much smarter to keep things in btc where possible and avoid fiat altogether, or to keep the information of your transactions as hidden as possible.

there is space for more exchanges then currently exist. I don't think mt gox has failed, but there is definitely room for improvement with the front-end, tool, and api.
it's still early, starting an exchange now could be worth quite a bit in the future :)
@_date: 2013-04-08 17:21:26
how would that work? Maybe pay ahead of time?
since transactions can take 5 mins or more, would there be a waiting area while you wait for your transaction to approve?
maybe it would work better if you had a whole foods account that you transferred bitcoins too. Just trying to imagine how companies are going to use bitcoins off the internet, super exciting :)

the negative to dollar cost averaging in is that if it only goes up you end up with less coins than if you purchased them all on the first day.
averaging in reduces your exposure to risk but also equally reduces your upside.
for only $300 (&lt;3 bitcoins) I'd probably go with 2 transactions a day or two apart. or all at once if I was feeling lazy :)

you also need to figure out the risk and see if it's worth it.
Using simple numbers: 
* buy 10 btc at a $1000 for $10k
* sell 10 btc at $1100. 
* Profit = $1000
* Risk = $10,000
*if* you time a swing correctly you could make 10%, probably less or maybe a little more. If you time a swing at the exact wrong time, you might lose the same %. Is that worth it to you?

there isn't a tax policy for half of the transaction you just described. if you follow someone's advice, even if they are a making a well educated guess like from a tax professional, you could end up getting double taxed when/if the government ever does create an official policy (likely retro-active).
avoid taxes for now, decide if you want to continue avoiding them when the government releases an official policy.

My first wire transfer was for over $5k, next week I might do $10-15k depending on how much more I decide to play with. I didn't think the cash options like bitinstant could support those numbers, isn't there a per day limit of like $2k? I'm trying to remember from memory, so could be way off, but I think that's why I went with bank wires.
My wire to bitfloor went through today, and it's my cakeday, woohoo :D They were a little backed up, which is why I was panicking on here, but all is well now.

even if it crashed, my litecoin holdings are just like my bitcoin holdings, hoping that in the longterm they will be very useful while riding out the short term volatility.

Modern economics has swallowed the lie that managed levels of low inflation are good for the economy. It allows government to spend secretly by printing money, screws savers and distorts the allocation of capital. 
Deflation is a good thing. No one complains that the cost for food, eye surgery, or iPhones continually decreases. But to a modern economist, they erroneously conclude that it would destroy the economy.
@_date: 2013-04-17 16:46:30
if you don't like volatility then you need to buy for the long term. that means not selling, no matter what, until months or years have gone by.
trying to day trade, which is essentially what you are doing by buying and selling within short periods of each transaction, if very very difficult to profit from.
@_date: 2013-05-14 23:13:17
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:32:25
i used them for a few weeks, back when you could still purchase bitcoins from their supply. sometimes you would have to try for hours, but then an order would go through.
instead of increasing how many they have to sell, they give you the option to buy at whatever the rate is when your funds clear. whoever is running that business needs to really rethink how much value that adds.
now I wire money to bitfloor. i just got verified on mtgox, but happy with my bitfloor experience so far so sticking with them for my next few purchases.
@_date: 2013-11-24 18:11:04
i think litecoin is trying to solve the speed of transaction problem, but bitcoin could also be tweaked to improve performance. 
If you consider a transaction *done* with fewer confirmations, then it's much faster (usually). For under $20 transactions, 1 or 2 should be fine, but probably still take too long for someone standing at a register.
There are also other possibilities, perhaps places like subway could have you transfer some coin into a separate system ahead of time that allows instantaneous transactions. Sister private blockchains if you will.
Summary: lots of solutions to the problem, the market will figure out which one(s) work best and get adopted.  
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:41:05
please explain, I don't understand how to interpret that graph.
@_date: 2013-02-15 17:15:14
I'm subbed to the latter. Both of those groups view precious metals as an alternative currency, but you might find some interested in bitcoin. I haven't taken the plung yet and have subbed to r/bitcoin for a few months now.

i'm also trying to convince everyone there is a coming crash. please pretty please sell me your coins cheap :D
@_date: 2013-04-09 21:34:12
yes, mostly thanks to the old banking system bitcoin is competing with. things like instant cheap money transfers will be the norm soon enough :)
@_date: 2013-11-11 03:03:51

thank you for sharing that! I was starting to sweat!
I only emailed support recently, but reading about the other delays bitfloor was having was starting to get to me.
@_date: 2013-04-12 05:09:31
i was worried for my first deposit too. but I did the exact amount, made sure my bank charged fees separately and not from the wire amount, and everything went through.
although at the time bitfloor was behind on processing deposits (likely they are right now too), so it took an extra 2 business days to clear. total of 4 business days (their website claims 1-2 after wire is received). just giving you a heads up of what to expect.
@_date: 2013-04-11 00:22:54

I wanted to buy 4 bitcoins this morning and got the limit error. installed this npm (thank god I'm a webdev and understand how to do all that), set the retry at 15 seconds, got my order in under 5 minutes while I surfed reddit. woohoo!!!
if I had known about this when i was trying to buy at $40 and it took me 3 days of trying, I would have saved $20 per bitcoin on my last order.

i know right!
@_date: 2013-04-02 19:22:02
I have had great interactions with their support team, but I ultimately switched to bitfloor using bank wires because I got tired of seeing the daily limit message.
if they remove the daily limit I might still use them on occasion, but I like being able to have cash in an account and buy instantly without all the hassle. Just wish bank wires were faster, but still faster than ACH (what coinbase uses)
@_date: 2013-04-08 17:24:55
don't tell me what to do with my hoard! :P
@_date: 2013-04-14 16:14:01
i'm using it as a way to diversify how I'm protecting my portfolio from rampant currency devaluing.
right now the value of bitcoins is still in a price discovery phase. for the longterm this will not be true. If bitcoin sees a larger market adoption, increases will not be "growth" but instead more closely reflect the devaluation of whatever fiat you decide to compare it against. (all far off of course, my guess is 5 years)
@_date: 2013-03-19 00:02:42
damnit! i wanted to buy some bitcoins 2 dollars ago and of course coinbase has hit their limit. :/
@_date: 2013-05-10 00:59:09
bitcoin doesn't have any impact on how fast the feds are printing money. your analogy was baseless and lacked any entertainment value. You suck at communicating, and you should feel bad.
@_date: 2013-11-13 21:41:42
you can't tell if it's a bubble until *years* later.
you can believe we are in an early adoption curve, a speculative bubble, or some other reason for the price increase. then invest accordingly to whicher reason you believe in.
in the end, it's all gambling. I'm hoping the winners are those who fall into the early adopter camp, but nobody knows.
@_date: 2013-10-02 18:16:47
I was trying to buy from coinbase at $86, of course my auth token still hasn't come through to login. gah!
oh well, i'll just go back to my normal plan of buying 4-5 every month or so.
edit: damnit google! google voice was marking those texts as spam, and blocked the call. Conspiracy? Now I've added the number, hopefully won't happen again. Sorry coinbase, wasn't you!
@_date: 2013-03-06 23:47:15
nevermind, coinbase just told me they are done with transactions for today or something lame (just posted the actual error) grrrr
@_date: 2013-03-21 18:36:16
i know, that's why i'm nervous. I'm hopeful they haven't given any updates because they are scrambling to fix the problem. &lt;fingers crossed&gt;

I've never visited their site before, but heard about it briefly. Anyone used it?

the ability to buy things in bitcoin is only one of many aspects that make it valuable.

@_date: 2013-04-23 21:10:31
the older generation won't understand cryptocurrencies, but that doesn't mean they won't be successful.
I doubt RP could successfully navigate a forum much less understand why they are important, let along a concept as new and complicated as bitcoin. That goes for most economists, politicians, and anyone over the age of 40.
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:34:19
i bought below the current price, and some above. I'm taking the long view, I expected this to happen and view it as a buying opportunity once it stabilizes again.
speculators are always going to lose their shirts, driven on by the huge wins of a very few. us long term investors just shake our heads and go back to drinking beer on the beach while watching the roller coaster in the distance.
@_date: 2013-04-11 00:54:13

@_date: 2013-04-14 02:30:36

how does the current market rate affect how you would go about acquiring bitcoins?
get them the normal way, as in what's in the sidebar. Do you have a specific question?
@_date: 2013-04-11 19:09:57
i dunno, as much as I would like to buy my next round of coins at under $30, I think the massive influx of new people into bitcoin means the price will settle quite a bit higher than that, and then continue growing (hopefully not as fast as last week)
@_date: 2013-05-02 16:59:17
first of all, in any volatile market you should dollar cost average in to minimize your losses.
second of all, if you are buying it as a medium to long term investment then you shouldn't consider the value reduced or increased until you are ready to sell it. edit: i hope you aren't selling it, the price goes up and down all the time. V-O-L-A-T-I-L-E
@_date: 2013-10-11 16:41:50
plus computer science has long been one of the only paths out of poverty in india, so there is a huge number of people educated with technology to be able to figure out bitcoin easily. I think the stars have aligned for a big uptake of bitcoin in India over the next year or so, but we'll see.
@_date: 2013-04-08 17:35:40
I wonder if people who are worried about collapsing fiat currencies will inadvertently help currencies not collapse. Thinking out loud here, bear with me. If a larger percentage get out of USD/yen/Euro and get into bitcoin, could that affect respective governments' decisions to continue inflating?
perhaps bitcoin will be a safe haven against fiat currencies, but will also have a sobering effect on the financial markets.

i would do a little bit of arbitrage, however I only recently got verified on mt gox and haven't sent them a wire transfer yet. all of my money is sitting on bitfloor while I dollar cost average in.

If I spend like $1000 on the rig, and maybe mining only pays for $600 of it then i'd still be happy, plus I'm contributing to the blockchain.
one thing I haven't figured out is how much bandwidth do mining rigs use? i think with my isp i'm fine if I don't go over 200 gigs a month, but I better figure that part out too.

@_date: 2013-04-10 16:31:48
you're forgetting to factor in the massive amount of money printing the US government is actively doing, and likely to increase. it will far outweigh any effects you describe.
many of the nasty effects of inflation are being reduced because of the dollar's reserve currency status. what would happen if bitcoin, along with other traditional currencies, unseated that status! rampant inflation in the dollar. if by then bitcoin has a thriving economy going, prices should be more stable in bitcoin and shoot through the roof in dollars. another reason bitcoins could get the push they need to go from a niche market to mass adoption.
if the dollar is losing value every month, more people will be desperate to find an alternative. bitcoin is a great one :)
@_date: 2013-10-02 20:09:31

coinbase is a startup. all of the exchanges are startups.
even if a big player enters the market, many aspects of bitcoin are new and will still be startup-y.
what does video editing software have to do with this discussion? and you are conveniently forgetting about the open-source options that do more than come close...
the reason you don't have startups in the financial space is because of insane barriers to entry our governments put into place. another reason why we need bitcoin...
with your attitude of it must be old or it's bad, why are you even interested in buying bitcoins? I think we have a troll alert, and i've wasted too many keystrokes already....

there will always be banks in foreign countries that will stay open to make money. That doesn't mean other countries can't make it more difficult to get  money there, but this would be very similar to citizens owning accounts in tax haven countries. It's illegal, yet still goes on quite a bit.

so your assumption is that the 100k of transactions was a baseline that didn't include speculation?

I think I answered my own question, when i reread: 
basically the difficulty can negatively affect mining over a longer period. it sounds like "GPU mining is dead" is a meme without much basis in fact. Still on the fence about buying a box, don't tell my partner but I was really using it as an excuse to buy a new gaming rig :)

that is not all.
i'm buying in for the long term because I think bitcoin has *a chance* of having a huge potential for utility in 5+ years.
it's a gamble, I'm only playing with money I can lose, but one I wouldn't take if I didn't believe in the future of bitcoin.
what really helps is seeing how badly the current financial sector is fucked. I'm desperately seeking *any* alternatives, bitcoin is but one.
@_date: 2013-10-19 17:46:04
oh that makes sense. It would be faster to wire some money to an exchange. That's how I bought the bulk of my bitcoins, $10k worth through bitfloor, luckily before they closed down.
I only buy $500 ish of bitcoins a month now, dollar cost averaging and all to slowly increase my btc's. For that purpose coinbase is great.
@_date: 2013-11-27 19:18:49
i've been hoping a better exchange will start trading ltc. I'll probably wait to sell until then, but might be a while :/

that's why it doesn't bother me when half the country support an inflationist like Obama, and other half support an inflationist like Romney. Woohoo, my gold and bitcoin holdings are in for another rally.
sucks that I have to bet against my country, but they have some hard lessons to learn :/
@_date: 2013-04-24 03:32:29
if you aren't in a hurry setting it to zero makes sense. my interpretation of the fee is that it's used to prioritize, but not required.
@_date: 2013-10-19 17:20:31
I'd sell, however I'm the kind of person who is happy to walk away from the blackjack table because I'm up $20 even though I've only been there for 10 minutes and was planning to stay for an hour. Fuck it, I'll go grab a beer and wait for my friends to be done :)
However my bitcoin holdings are a long term bet, so I won't be selling any anytime soon. I do use them for purchases now and then, but I always refresh what I spend the same day. 
I'm up thousands with my bitcoin investment in USD, but don't care. It's essentially my lotto ticket, and since it represents a very small portion of my savings I'm comfortable with the high risk.

i wouldn't thank him, probably one of the assholes who downvoted your question that a lot of others are asking too.
not everyone follow bitcoin 24/7, but most asshats in here will downvote you for not being a bitcoin expert.
@_date: 2013-04-11 00:35:15
what's your interpretation of that graph? still overpriced even after the correction?
edit: not a trader. I make big buys for the long term whenever I have some money to throw around. I buy at whatever the rate is that day.
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:40:18
not true, AT ALL!! there are no rules on how to properly file taxes for bitcoin. whenever they make the rule there is a good chance it'll be retroactive for at least a year.
whatever taxes you voluntarily decide to pay this year could very well still be taxed again when the rules come out.
@_date: 2013-04-02 17:09:29
the government can do whatever it wants, but you have to look to how effective those measures would be.
when they banned gold, guess what millions still held onto it. 


You know bitcoin is worth over $100 per bitcoin already right?
technology has an established history of disrupting business models and decentralizing power. My money is on bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies having a similar effect in the financial sector. Feel free to keep all of your money in cash.
@_date: 2013-04-05 01:17:46


what? that wasn't my question, and btc-e is in russia.


wow, if you're a typical r/bitcoin sub then we're fucked.


If I want to put in a buy order at below the current market price, what are some basic strategies? How does a buy order work as the price goes down, will they execute at only the price you list? Lots of people, including me, have never bought on an open exchange before. All of the info I found that applied to the stock market wasn't helpful for buying on a bitcoin exchange.
You sound like someone who thinks they know everything, and downvotes questions you *think* are simple yet you don't even know the answers youself! 
@_date: 2013-04-11 00:07:20
We could start a new sub r/bitcoinz
@_date: 2013-04-03 15:50:23
mine still hasn't gone through, watching the price shoot up... :(
maybe the delay will help me avoid buying at a peak? Trying to find a positive :/
@_date: 2013-11-20 20:14:20
it's a new emerging market. organizations that give unbiased reviews and solve trust issues that are needed in all markets have not happened yet.
early adopters are shouldering the risk, with the understanding that they will *possibly* have a higher payout than those who wait for bitcoin to be "safe".
@_date: 2013-04-23 21:08:19
fantastic comment though, hopefully readers read that too.

@_date: 2013-11-27 19:04:10
the only altcoin I ever played with is litecoin. I bought around 800 back when it was about $.65/coin.
Likely a bubble now that it's at $20/coin, especially considering it lacks many of the underpinnings bitcoin has developed in the past year (more adoption, atm's, mobile apps, news coverage).
I would sell some if btc-e weren't completely down right now. oh well, my wait and see strategy has worked so far for both bitcoin and litecoin. Whenever I get the urge to try and time the market at sell at a perceived peak, I end up deciding to "wait and see". It's painful in the short term, and so far 100% awesome in the long term.

there are many ways to remember an address and a password together. you can write it down, you can store it on a computer, and you can create a coin looking thing using those numbers.

oh you mean at your bank. My bank only supports over the phone wires.
@_date: 2013-10-09 21:38:40
during the last dip I bought more gold, silver, and I continue to buy bitcoin every month. I haven't added any more litecoin since my initial buy-in because I consider that my riskiest value store.
i don't consider it investing, more like betting against the morons in DC. If the economy manages not to tank, then my traditional investments will hopefully be paying off. if it does tank, hopefully some of the less traditional stuff in my portfolio will be worth something.

@_date: 2013-04-11 14:49:14
on the other hand, the exchanges all do have problems that need to get better.
I'm happy with bitfloor, but the first time I wired money it took an extra 2 business days because they were backed up processing incoming money. understandable given the dramatic rise in usage bitcoin is enjoying, but from a customer stand point very frustrating.
i hate seeing a good buying opportunity slip by because it takes 3-4 business days to get money into an exchange (i buy in large enough amounts that the cash deposit methods don't work). edit: I realize most of this delay is a problem with using our current financial systems, a problem that a btc economy solves.
speaking of which, I hope the current prices hold till monday, that's when I'm buying in some more :)
@_date: 2013-05-14 23:06:14
i missed the panic selling too.
@_date: 2013-02-27 01:27:00
if it slides back below 30 that will definitely be a trigger for me. I better get an account setup
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:33:53
bitcoin is still in a price discovery phase, totally normal. I'm very hopefull that the prices will be around $120 for monday when I'll have my next round of cash to invest on bitfloor.  &lt;fingers crossed&gt;

dollar cost averaging is so boring. it evens things out, but also lowers your potential gain.

I'm thinking of throwing a grand or two into the bitcoin fray after the next fall, but I'm worried that another bitcoin technology with some improvements might become more popular over the next 10 years.
Going to play regardless, I like to gamble, but just theorizing because I found bitcoin on google and not altavista :)
Although even with competitors (a healthy state btw) bitcoin will still be a good investment, just maybe not the crazy boom some people in here think.

@_date: 2013-04-11 14:36:40
it's still very early in bitcoins life. a stable price hasn't been discovered, and most of it's usefulness hasn't come to fruition so a lot of speculation goes into valuing bitcoin based on how much it *could* do.
it's high risk, stop complaining. go buy an index fund or a CD if you want something "safer".

that's me (although I don't consider myself a libertarian). More like people who want to hedge against inflation in their home currencies, no reason to attach a political ideology to it. 
My partner and I for years now have kept slightly under 10% of our portfolio in precious metals and related investment vehicles (mining stock, that kind of thing). We decided to test out the waters with bitcoin with just under 1%. If we like it over the next few months we might bump that up to 3-4% :)

just in case:


@_date: 2013-03-21 14:22:38
About $1000. I might do another $500-1000 if coinbase stops shitting the bed, or if I get the will to drop by walmart and do the deposit route.

only true if you're a Keynesian.
