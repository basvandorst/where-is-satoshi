After recently, any country would be damn foolish and irresponsible to actively try to integrate bitcoin into their economy.

why not bitcoin?

I am also having this issue... stuck on tier 1.
I **want** to give you my money... I am **trying** to give you my money, but I guess it's just not meant to be.

doesn't bitcoin mining now have a ridiculously high buy in if you want to mine too?
@_date: 2017-06-02 05:47:05
how did it happen?
@_date: 2017-06-17 19:24:03
Sure it is isn't it?
Miners have too much control and they're hurting BTC
@_date: 2017-06-17 19:59:26
33 eth minimum not 1000..... and 33 eth is an old estimate too so it will probably be even less now that eth is worth way more.

Ether is on the verge of passing bitcoin's market cap.
At what point do you stop calling them "altcoins"? Even after they have more value than BTC?
@_date: 2017-06-17 17:47:13
I find it hypocritical of you to be critical of Ether's potential flaws when Bitcoin's flaws are effecting us much more right now. August 1. Slow transactions. Expensive fees.
Ether does it faster. For less money. With no mining cartel or ability for one. Ether can execute any code as well.
@_date: 2017-06-17 20:58:42


That's ironic considering the biggest bitcoin story of today is literally about a cartel of chinese miners trying to commandeer *our* network.


Well you asked for 3 apps and I told you 3, each worth millions and hundreds of millions *already*. So the fact that you personally don't want to use them is completely irrelevant because they're more than sufficiently popular without you.
@_date: 2017-06-17 20:09:25
Then why does a small cartel of chinese miners control 80% of the hash power if its so easy to buy into at a profit?
@_date: 2017-06-17 21:31:42
actually etherdelta and that big gambling site built on ether probably *do* earn millions since they're very popular and do well with fees
@_date: 2017-06-17 19:54:31
How can you not see the hypocrisy in your question? Where exactly does **bitcoin**s value come from? How can you defend one having value and one not?
3 useful applications:
1. etherdelta - a decentralized crypto exchange where settlement is fully decentralized and runs on top of the ether network
2. tokens - take your pick - you can make your own token on top of the network. There's like 20+ popular tokens worth hundreds of millions of dollars
3. gambling - decentralized gambling apps, there's already several very popular ones.
I think bitcoin users need to be more open minded about ether and ether users need to be more open minded about bitcoin. I don't understand why some people are so dead set against one or the other. **Buy both** they're both promising.

That is from April and the price of ether has gone up 10x since then. The more recent Mauve paper I linked above says you require 32 ETH.
@_date: 2017-06-17 19:10:04
uh, what are you talking about? There's been lots of days lately where Ether has moved more volume than BTC so you're just wrong.
Ether also has more nodes than BTC.
And Ether's market cap is 6-8% away from surpassing BTC.
Bitcoin is so slow because its protocol severely needs to be improved.

how's it going to feel once this "shitcoin" is worth more than BTC?
Honestly why are you so petty....
