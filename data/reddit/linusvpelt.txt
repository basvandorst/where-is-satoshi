Totally agree on stocks.
On the Bitcoin bottom I am not sure, also because it seems to have started to correlate with the stock market, although to an unclear extent and relationship.
This can be the direction for another research.

It was indeed created for these very same conditions that we are experiencing and discussing right now. And that is amazing.
I am not sure it will be adopted as by the scenario you described because of the power of whales and miners manipulating the market, and because the profile of hodlers changed during 2017 and got many new 'investors' oriented more towards speculation and hence dependent from the global stock market and their access to credit (lots of Bitcoins in 2017 seems to have been purchased with loans and other forms of debt, so dependent from interest rates).
Fiat inflation would be a more favorable scenario for Bitcoin.
Please consider my comments don't want to be fud against BTC, I just want to discuss different perspectives in an objective way. I have lots of respect for Bitcoin, just trying to be rational.
