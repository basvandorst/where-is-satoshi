Good call, and I was aware, but definitely not at first. I was going to get .1 at first, but thought it through for a bit and went over my finances and thought about some of the things I never use anymore that I'll probably end up selling on craigslist. I just wanted to go for it, hehe. 
Thank You! : )

Excellent! I love variety, Thank You!

Solid advice!! I thought about this very much beforehand, and my goal will definitely be to hold onto it for as long as I can... Okay unless they're worth $1mil a piece in the next 5-10 years, then I might have second thoughts... : )

Very good point, though I just built this computer very recently and don't really have much on it besides Starcraft and now Electrum and I already freak out enough about crazy cookie monster stuff from websites! 
I could see a lot of people having those issues though if they were to try and store bitcoin. Thanks for the reminder though! : )

Thanks so much for that! That's very generous of You as well, and so far I'm definitely liking the idea of using those tip funds to tip others in the future as well. Thanks for suuuch a warm welcome here  into /bitcoin : )

lol That's awesome, I went to an "audio recording school" myself, and I'm guessin' that person probably has some pretty nifty gear.
Sounds like a pretty smooth CL deal took place! : )

Wow, this is great! Perfect for some of my skimming-through habits. Thank You! : )

Seriously that is so generous of you, Thank YOU for sharing. I just signed up for this changetip thini to collect it, and my intention is to use those funds to re-tip to others, once I read through the instructions again! : ) 
Holy cow this is awesome!

I'll definitely take that advice, I have Electrum already downloaded so hopefully it's ready to go.
