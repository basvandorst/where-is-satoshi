I've heard good things about independent reserve, and made a few purchases through them.
Any opinions or bad stories on them?
@_date: 2018-01-19 11:29:13
I was a bit confused about that too.
But I think the point was that August is so long ago that it's beyond "swamped" and now into "being ignored" territory.
@_date: 2018-01-19 11:31:00
"hacked" implies bypassing authentication altogether.
@_date: 2018-01-12 16:17:21
But only for a limited.

Does anyone know?...
"The Internet of Money Vol2" is out now, is this the same as Vol1 + more?  
Or is there anything in Vol1 that wouldn't be in Vol2?

This phrase is used a lot, and I'm not disagreeing, but it got me thinking...
Were any of the previous communication methods (books, word-of-mouth) more reliable purely on a Bullshit:TotalContent ratio?  Maybe not.

It's much more scientific when done via stick.

Just curious... for what usage are most people buying paracord?  I don't really know anything about it.

Enough of this interest could be the catalyst for some deflation for them.

It's ridiculous how hard it used to be to find the capacity written on a hard drive.  As if it's some minor detail that nobody would ever want to know.

He was grabbed on the penis.
It was democccracy manifest, I tell you.
@_date: 2017-10-26 13:18:39
He's fucked.  I reverse image searched one of the photos at the bottom of "MARIO GIUSEPPE", 8 pages of results on scam websites, here's a few of the first:
* 
* 
* 
* 
In fact all those of those photos of people at the bottom seem to appear together on a fuckload of sites.  Must have been in some scam-website-design package or something.
[See for yourself.](
Also that website doesn't even have https.  And the charts on the homepage aren't even cryptocurrencies.
They also have both "login" and "register" buttons on both forms, haha wtf.

And there'll probably still be people having a cry about it being a repost.

Go to Google images, and click the camera icon, then paste the image URL.

Yeah namecheap's new interface on both the front and back end sucks.
I've been moving everything to namesilo recently.  Cheaper, free whois privacy forever, and a usable interface.

Again, none of those suggestions are mutually exclusive to protecting yourself.
You could equally say that the illusion of being able to fully protect yourself simply encourages the government to go even further.  If there's no public political push-back at all, it will make things exponentially worse.
Obviously the government doesn't listen to the people enough on this topic.  But the listening isn't zero.
@_date: 2015-02-25 12:07:31
When you say...


Do you mean...
a. Be silent and avoid any public resistance?
b. Try to defend your rights by making requests/demands and raising public discussion?
@_date: 2015-02-26 07:39:57
My entire point is yes use technology, and **also** stand up for your rights.  
WTF is going on here?  Am I being mass trolled or something?
@_date: 2015-02-25 12:42:44
Ok cool, so we agree then.  It's just the semantics of the word "ask" that seems to be contentious.
I'm certainly not suggesting we limit protests and discussion to writing "pretty please" with glitter pens and posting them to Santa.
The point of my comment was that we should do more than **only** implementing personal privacy technology.

I watched Morgan Spurlock's doco about Bitcoin the other day.
When he was buying things in cafes etc, it seemed that he had to type the amount to pay into his phone each time?  Usually lots of digits.  
Can this be automated with a QR code or something?  I know you can already do the recipient address that way, but can it include the amount requested too?

Listing two irrelevant items doesn't disprove everything else.
Here's some proposed reforms in America: 
Do those proposals, and similar ones, including in other countries amount to exactly zero?
Even if no laws actually get changed, does the publicity and education of the public on these matters have zero worth?
Do you think it's better to be silent and stand idly by doing nothing?
@_date: 2015-02-25 10:16:09
They're not mutually exclusive.
What's the downside of asking?
Edit: I'm finding the responses and downvotes to this comment (and below) quite odd.  It seems that people here prefer staying silent over making demands to their government?
@_date: 2015-02-25 13:04:26


Yeah exactly.  Which is another reason I think it's crazy that anybody thinks that's the only thing we should do.
@_date: 2015-02-25 14:21:41
None of your responses have anything to do with my points.  So I'm gunna assume you're just a troll.

It's hard to give a specific example to something as meaningless and vague as "let's protect citizen's privacy".
Laws are much more specific than that.  Even if the laws aren't effective, they do at least have a small chance of helping, either now, or in the future.  
The few changes that Obama is trying to make are based on existing laws that have been broken.  If those laws weren't already in place, why would he change anything at all?
Even if the government breaks its own laws, it at least creates media attention, which in turn creates a bit more awareness that people need to protect themselves.  So that's one example on where it "would have any effect on actual protecting of the privacy".
Why do you think laws would make things worse?
@_date: 2015-02-25 13:46:51
I never said all laws are good.  Put down the crackpipe there, champ.
So you're against trying to create laws to limit the NSA's spying power?
