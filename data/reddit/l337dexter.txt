Lets see some love for Sumokoin!

Yeah, fuck us colorblinds

I'm with you man. I hate the constant fighting. Prove worthiness with your software - not this childish fighting.

I wonder if there are more colors in this puzzle that the colorblind can't see, thus proving our attempts futile
@_date: 2018-05-19 16:00:58
Need a program to iterate through them all, and check them. Iterating through all combinations is trivial, but I don't know how to check the validity of each one
@_date: 2018-05-19 16:30:08
Yeah, that's a really good example. I may steal that

A bunch of the new GPU instances in AWS should do it
@_date: 2018-05-19 16:59:27
Hm. OP mentioned original white-paper. That's a little deceptive
@_date: 2018-05-19 16:05:37
If anything maybe a block chain recruiter? Or core? Whoever the fuck wants help working on the daemons
@_date: 2018-05-19 18:43:29
Code shouldn't be difficult...now getting the compute time-thats expensive
@_date: 2018-05-01 15:57:26
Bitcoin.org calls it bitcoin core?
bitcoin/bitcoin on github calls it bitcoin core?
Don't you core people own those?

Fake News
@_date: 2018-05-19 16:29:26
Should link the original.

Isn't the whole purpose of bip39 so wallets are easier to open? Normal words instead of a long string of letters and numbers?
@_date: 2018-05-19 15:56:09
The mnemonic seeds...e.g. the 12/24 word seeds a lot of wallets use for addresses, as it is easier to remember/type than private keys

Thank you, Sir Buzz-Killington

Why can't you all argue about something important, like transactions fees or tx/second.
Solve those, make it secure, maybe people will use it as a currency instead of a store of value.
If someone were to stumble upon this subreddit it looks like a bunch of whiny 2-year-olds who get really loud and stop listening when they don't get their way.

In the future, when's it largely ipv6, it will be a lot closer an example of domain name to ipv6, since ipv6 has a closer character set to private keys (at least, how it currently works). IPv6 is 0-9,a-f(?) and private keys are alpha-numeric (I don't remember if private keys can contain symbols)

Is one of the k/z comparisons in white and the other in a different color? 
@_date: 2016-03-02 19:10:40
I understand why upping the hashrate won't increase.  I just feel like more full nodes should.  Guess I don't quite understand it enough.
@_date: 2016-03-02 19:54:03
I thought this was the kind of discussion that theymos shadowbanned with an iron fist?
@_date: 2016-03-02 18:44:51
Well I can't mine or anything so I guess I'll just watch...
@_date: 2018-06-28 16:43:57
No need to make it toxic, man. Why does everything have to be a competition with you people
@_date: 2018-06-28 16:42:24
Wait, is kek bad or good?

All of new york was supposed to have Verizon Fios by the end of 2014 or something...most of New York still doesnt have it and Verizon tries hard not to install more.
@_date: 2015-07-16 17:03:44
I would love to!  I just cant afford it right now :(
@_date: 2016-02-01 15:02:30
I keep debating if its worth it to run a full node.  Yes there is benefit to the network, but you get nothing for your power/bandwidth.
@_date: 2016-02-01 16:07:28
How? I thought miners collected the fees and full nodes got nothing?
@_date: 2018-03-01 22:12:16
If your coin truly is better you'll win. And vice versa. Maybe monero wins all, who knows.
As a lurker, this shit is toxic. It doesn't make me want to use either coin if it's all just a petty dick measuring contest.
Did Sony tell Microsoft to eat shit everywhere with HD-DVD? No, Sony made a better product (and the porn industry chose them). Maybe stop bitching about other coins when yours hasn't won yet.
Edit: your you're 
@_date: 2018-02-12 19:50:10
That just shows its on a downward trend right now. Show a longer graph and you can correlate better. You don't have enough datapoints
@_date: 2018-03-01 18:50:23
Why do you care? Why can't you just care about Bitcoin, and they care about Bitcoin Cash. What good does trying to cause controversy do?
@_date: 2015-09-11 00:03:14
Will me spinning up another full node help or hurt?
