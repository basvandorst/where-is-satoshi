Not too hard to answer the % question if you just google. There's 12,440,675 BTC in existence, just divide 750,000 by that number and multiply by 100. You end up with just above 6%

Where did I say you need a bank with bitcoin? I was just comparing it to off shore bank accounts in terms of avoiding taxes. And yeah, there are ways to adapt like a VAT, but the problem with VAT and other taxes like it is that it's a flat tax which affects the less wealthy more than the wealthy. Ideally you'd want a progressive tax that increases with income.
@_date: 2014-02-25 12:42:02
it's a bit more complicated that that. the malleability issue has to do with gox tracking their withdrawal transactions based on the unique ID that is generated for each transaction. the attackers took the transaction before it was included into a block along with many other transactions in the network (AKA mined or confirmed, which happens roughly every ten minutes) and changed it slightly so that it's still a valid transaction with the same money going in and out, but a different transaction ID. only one of these transactions can ever be confirmed and included into the actual blockchain, so there's no direct theft of funds.
the issue is that mt gox had their system implemented in a way that it would check on the transaction through the transaction ID, and if the attacker's modified transaction made it into a block first, it would see that the original transaction failed and then try to generate ANOTHER transaction. this has been considered bad practice since the issue was originally discovered in 2011.

I totally agree that that there's a lot of issues that need to be addressed before it's ready for the mainstream, but the thing you need to realize is that right now, bitcoin is like the internet in 1992. It's like arguing back then that the internet is too complicated to use for the average person to ever use it. Bitcoin and the technology and services around it aren't set in stone. For a five year old open-source experiment, it's doing remarkably well.
The misclick and bad copy/paste job issue is already a non-issue if you're using QR codes to send payment. Another fix for it is [BIP0070]( which, oversimplified, is like an addon protocol that allows for a much easier, cleaner, and more functional checkout/payment process. 
Customer support and reversibility will probably come through optionally enrolling with 3rd party services that offer this protection, trading off the decentralized benefits of bitcoin.

The total limit is a result of the initial block reward (50 BTC) the block half-life that it takes for that reward to be halved (210,000). I think those were intentionally chosen to end up with 21 million bitcoins because of the figure that all gold mined in human history can be fit into a cube roughly **21** meters on each side. 
Satoshi created bitcoin with the idea of being sort of a digital analog of gold (finite supply, mining, etc), as well as the fact that it built upon Nick Szabo's "Bit Gold" proposal, so I think that 21 million was sort of a clever nod to that.

bitcoin is here to stay regardless of what regulation ends up coming. whether or not bitcoin ever sees mainstream adoption is another matter though. without a clear regulatory framework, businesses/corporations are going to be hesitant to adopt it. regulation like the OP discusses will also make buying/selling bitcoin on exchanges much more friendly to the average consumer.

And what reason is that? The only real reason they currently aren't is because cents have been the denomination for the last few hundred years already. The decision in the first place was arbitrary.


The better question is "Why **shouldn't** Bitcoin be an exception?" Also, although they aren't referred to as milli-units, there are many currencies that are subdivided into 1/1000ths (as well as some others with 1/10ths), rather than 1/100ths like cents.


This is hilarious. If teaching people what milli and micro mean (which they should know anyways) is what's keeping Bitcoin from being adopted, then it's really not worthy of mass adoption anyways.


Honestly, I think you're missing the point. You keep comparing it to the dollar, but the thing about Bitcoin is that it is **so much more** than just a regular currency. It's a completely new and unique kind of money. We were previously limited in the ways we could subdivide a currency because currencies were physical and came in the form of bills and coins. That's irrelevant now: with Bitcoin, we can specify quantities down to 8 decimal places. Why shouldn't we take advantage of that? And if we're going to, why not use the globally agreed upon (aside from 3 silly countries), established naming conventions. 
Not to mention that the SI system is of course at the center of science and technology, and Bitcoin, as a computer science and technological innovation, is an obvious match for it as well.

And I'm okay with that, because despite like you said, overall it wasn't as efficient as if they would've waited for the technology to develop, it had a very large net positive effect on the rest of society.  
NASA employed thousands of engineers, scientists, contractors, etc. The space program gave us countless technological advancements/improvements, helped reduced the cost of those technologies, and also created entirely new ones, and it pumped billions into the economy that benefited everyone far more than the initial investment through the multiplier effect. Had NASA and the space program never existed, we would've been decades behind from where we are now technologically, since we would've had to wait until it was economically viable to do so privately.
And that's exactly my point in the last post: one of the great functions of government is that it can take up projects that no private organization would engage in because of costs, low ROI, etc, **for the greater good**.

completely incorrect and misleading, hashing power below 51% can totally be exploited and be a "real problem for the blockchain". for example, with only 40% hashing power you have a 50% chance of double spending against a 6 times confirmed transaction. you don't need a 100% chance of success in order to cause damage to the integrity of the blockchain.

Why so hostile? You sound pathetic. Your kind of thinking and attitude (fuck all of you, etc) is toxic and a big reason of why a lot of people think bitcoin is a joke.
The mainstream would benefit from bitcoin, but the average person doesn't "need" bitcoin. Most of them get by with traditional currency and banking facilities just fine. Even if they did "need" bitcoin, the average person also "needs" more exercise, but that doesn't mean they're actually doing so. A lot of people are hesitant to use bitcoin because of the risks they associate with it. If you can control those risks with regulation, people will be much more open to using bitcoin.
Like I said, regardless of what regulation is passed, bitcoin is here to stay, since the only way to actually force control over it would be to shut down the Internet. Nothing is going to stop you or anyone else from using bitcoin in the same way you're using it now. That's the beauty of bitcoin, you have the CHOICE to use services and companies that will eventually be governed by a certain amount of regulation, or you can CHOOSE to circumvent them and just use the protocol on its own. No one will, or even can, force you to "knock on their door" to use bitcoin.

1. I was paraphrasing netwalker's "these sociopaths print money out of thin air". Sociopath and crazy are fairly interchangeable, I don't think that I was putting words in anyone's mouth.
2. Of course I understand what it means, and of course there's governments that do it, but my point is that in most developed countries, it's not an issue. Yes, it's terrible for people in Zimbabwe or maybe Ukraine or Angola in the 90s, or Argentina recently to a lesser extent, but otherwise, developed countries are sane enough to avoid policies that will cause hyperinflation.
If you actually look at a chart of US inflation, the only times it has increased to noteworthy levels in the last 50 years was in the 1970's, and that had nothing to do with a war.

@_date: 2014-06-14 08:31:40
This is a *block withholding attack*, not selfish mining. 
Selfish mining is when a miner/pool does not immediately release a block solution, and instead keeps working on the next block, making a secret "private chain". With a decent amount of hasing power, the attacker has a chance of building a longer chain than the public chain. The attacker can then release their private chain, forcing blocks in the public chain to be orphaned, meaning that the rest of the network has wasted its hashing power.
@_date: 2014-03-18 23:33:36

As another commenter pointed out, "oh god, the does-bitcoin-have-intrinsic-value argument again." But I'd argue that it does have intrinsic value since owning bitcoin allows you to participate in the distributed, trustless payment network associated with it. Like I said, you can't treat it as "just a currency", since it's really much more (just wait until things like blockchain based contracts, side chains, etc. become a thing and then tell me it's only a currency).
Whether or not you think it's ultimately the purpose of bitcoin, the speculative value aspect of it is one of the biggest reasons it's come so far. The price booms from a few cents to a few hundred dollars and eventually to over a thousand, and the corresponding media attention, have brought a huge amount of people into the bitcoin community. And with the upcoming bitcoin ETFs/funds coming to Wall St, I don't see that part of bitcoin going away any time soon.

You know, if you actually thought about the numbers, you'd see how ridiculous what you're saying is. It's not like the taxes that went to NASA were taken from a few individuals in large amounts, the taxes were distributed among the population and corporations, and at a total cost of $25 billion from 1961 to 1972, with a population of 200 million back then, that amounts to $125 over a span 11 years (and that's ignoring corporate taxes). That's not a sum that prevented anyone from building a fusion reactor.
[It's hilariously incorrect to reduce the outcomes of the space program to "a flag on the moon".](

your second argument is like saying the FBI would want Silk Road to keep operating so they could keep monitoring its users. if the conspiracy theory is true, then the FBI views bitcoin/Gox as something that facilitates money laundering and other illicit activities, so of course they want to kill it.
also the first one doesn't hold entirely either, since customer funds aren't held in individual wallets for each customer, they go into one or a few big wallets
the third one can be explained by the fact that they simply want the funds frozen while they're doing the investigation. mt gox as a whole was not an entirely illegal operation like the silk road was, so they can't justify actually seizing all the funds.
as for the last one, i'm not entirely familiar with the law, but perhaps he's being forbidden from even mentioning a gag order? if there's a secret investigation, then karpeles spilling the beans about a gag order would be a clear signal that there's an investigation going on.
if the bank vaults containing the cold paper wallets were seized/frozen by the government, then that would also counter some of your arguments
i don't necessarily believe any of the theories fyi, i just don't think that those are reasons to preclude that idea.

Really? Bitcoin regulation is the reason why America isn't / won't be the superpower it once was? lel

DPR didn't get busted because he wasn't using Tor (which isn't all that secure anyways), he got busted because of sloppiness from when he first started and advertised SR

still far, far less than what it was, even before the run up of the last several weeks
edit: 
with a 50 Gh/s miner it'd take 2 years, 173 days to mine a block on your own. assuming 100W power consumption and 10 USD/kWh, it'd be $217 for one block, which would give you 25 BTC

Well, I think you're half right. China is part of what made it so overvalued. The big boom over the last few weeks all started with China...

if reputation trumps all, why is gox still most popular

It would take years to break those hashes

As far as I know, they didn't ID him from his IP from those forum posts, it was all from the email he used. Even if they did, using Tor wouldn't have protected him from the email thing at all.


[Granted, it's RT, but it's pretty straightforward.](

Bitcoinwisdom's value depends on which exchange you're looking at (default is mtgox), Coinbase adjusts theirs using some sort of algorithm based on current exchange prices, Blockchain probably also uses something different.

I actually think focusing on one city is the better way to go long term. IMO it's faster and smarter to try hitting a critical mass of people in an area and setting an example of success, which will encourage other communities to adopt. Otherwise, without a clear demonstration of it working well, people would be more hesitant to adopt and growth is slower.

did you not watch BTCChina at all in the last 24 hours?
@_date: 2013-10-04 22:10:34
well would you look at that...

it's a sensationalist headline, every other article says it's a warning about the risks, not a ban

The reason confirmations exist is to prevent someone from double spending. To double spend however, you need a significant percentage of the mining power in the bitcoin network. It's not at all cost effective to go through the trouble of reaching around 50% of mining power just to go buy a cup of coffee. 
Confirmations are really only important for large transactions, and for those, it's not really a big deal to wait half an hour for a few confirmations.

that was quick drop that lasted for a few minutes, this is something larger... dont be delusional. i'm not saying it can't go back up again, but it won't just "bounce" back like it did a few days ago
