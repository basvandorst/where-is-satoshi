I see. Now this is indeed a different issue, and, luckily, it is easier to spot. Basically, once the private key is stolen it has to be sent somewhere. In order to send it, the extension must connect with an external web site. And the list of external sites it may connect to is shown upon installation, and in the manifest file of the extension.
The issue I'm addressing is one that *does not require the extension to connect to any external web site*. I have changed the TL;DR above to make this issue clearer.

As for blockchain, they could try to check for client-side code modifications by sending you some javascript as part of their web site. No extension needed (since you're on their site anyway). But it's not easy to do this correctly: a malicious extension could mess with blockchain's verification script as well.
As for the extensions you mention, they may be more secure than the web site itself as these extensions typically pull the addresses out of the unmodified HTML code. And they live in their own sandbox, so another extension cannot mess with them.
And I'm not sure why you're mentioning private keys here. As far as I know this issue has nothing to do with private keys.

Negative rates are nothing special if you take into account the inflation.
Example: If inflation is 3%, there is not much difference between an interest rate of +0.1% and an interest rate of -0.1%. Both mean you're losing.

You can install third party chrome extensions (crx files) that do not auto update.
Also, compiling an extension from source is a piece of cake. Just open chrome://extensions as the url, switch on developer mode and click Load unpacked extension.

Make sure that no extensions are allowed in private more though, as this is an option too.

Disclaimer: I'm the author of this extension, so I'm possibly not the most objective person to offer advice here.
But I'm also a user of 3rd party Chrome extensions, and I try to be as cautious as possible. Chrome extensions can alter data on sites and can connect to remote services, so you're very correct to be cautious. Here's what I typically do before installing extensions from little-known developers:
1) I check if the developer offers the source code somewhere. That's a good first step towards transparency. Check the manuscript.json file to see what remote sites the extension can consult.
In this case the source code is available at [ The manuscript.json file ([here]( says that the extension will only communicate with Blockchain or Blockexplorer, and the script of the extension ([here]( in javascript) will show you that it only *reads* from there services.
2) But don't take my word for it that this is actually the code hosted at the Chrome store. Check it for yourself: You can download the Chrome store version through sites such as [ Once you have downloaded the .crx file, rename it to .zip and extract it. You can then see all the code included.
And a last word of caution: Google Chrome updates extensions without explicitly asking for your permission. So if at some point you've installed a "clean" extension, if there's a malicious developer behind it he may still include malicious code in future versions, without you noticing it unless you check the updated source again.
That said, you can rest assured that this extension is okay. And if you have questions about it you can come knocking at my door.
[edit: added manuscript.json description]
