Why would anyone have to give permission ? 
And with futures your just predicting the price of bitcoin, you don't actually own any so not sure what you mean by "complete and utter control"

Try sending you money to revolut, then send your money from there to coinbase.

You are not in control of your private key. When you create a wallet you get a private key that is used to access the wallet, as long as you keep that key secure your bitcoin is safe. When you leave your bitcoin with coinbase they are the ones in control of the private key and you are placing your trust in them to keep your bitcoin secure. Incidents have happened in the past resulting in people loosing money, for example nicehash was hacked recently and some people lost a lot of money (nicehash is not an exchange but the general idea is the same).

use GDAX and select your own price with zero fees? Same company as well so you can use your coinbase account.

you accidentally sent your bitcoin to the wrong address didn't you?
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:42:41
Theoretically possible i believe but the chance of it happening are ridiculously small

Very interesting watch. Only thing i disagree with is his point on keeping money spread across exchanges. I guess he could be talking from a day traders perspective though in which case that would make sense rather than storing in a wallet
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:43:36
Search the address on block chain, can you see the transaction there?
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:30:39
you shouldn't post how much you own, makes you a much easier target 
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:26:47
nobody knows.
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:50:25
Wouldn't selling low and then buying high lose you money?
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:11:02
Dont store your coins on coinbase, or any exchange. Get your self a wallet
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:30:18
 You wont have access to your bitcoin until the transaction has completed. As for the payments doubling im not to sure how that would happen, hopefully some one else here can help you with that.

Edit: just re read your post, sorry i thought you asked about bitcoin futures market.
Putting it simply you try to predict if the price of bitcoin will rise or fall. Some people think that the price has been artificially increased over the past few (weeks/days?) by people who when futures opens will bet on the price to drop and then they will short.
