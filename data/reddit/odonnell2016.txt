I only had about. 07BTC in the wallet, I actually store the majority of my coins I'm holding onto as an investment in paper wallets... I didn't back it up, because it was essentially pocket money, but in hindsight, you're right, still out about $30

I've seen written by people on Facebook (who appear far more knowledgeable than me) that the blockchain is used as a self encrypting algorithm that complicated it's own solvability with the calculations done for mining operations

Blockchain locked me out, and I won't authorize my sign in (still have my password, pin AND mnemonic, and I'm still locked out)
And when I search my wallet address on a block explorer, it shows a balance of 0, and a recent transaction sending the little bit I had out. Blockchain customer support says "they know about the bug, but have no time line on when it'll be fixed"
So I'm writing off the $35 worth of btc that was there, and just never ever using them again

I had mine on blockchain.info.... and now it's gone

Physical security of the vault wasn't broken at all, although triton and Tranax are 2 of the only brands where the vault CAN be cracked.  What this guy did was simply reprogram the os of the machine to give him free money

The only thing they've said at all is that there's no timeline on when their bug will be fixed

Hey I'll fully admit that I'm new to bitcoin, if I've been taught wrong, feel free to correct me.

If he used a drill he's an idiot, the top case vanity slides out in a track to allow maintenance access to those particular USB ports.... all you need is strength to break the plastic locking bar
Then it's a simple matter of changing the destination of a dispense test from the divert tray to the cash plate, then running continuous dispense tests

Hi there, former ATM technician here
I'll tell you upfront, what this guy did was not impressive...
Triton And Tranax are two of the most substandard ATM companies out there, and the security is only as strong as the back office installed by the user. Convinience store atms are usually stock models that have the stock software, and Tranax and triton don't have any native security programing...
A block chain based encryption would inherently be more secure, and while it may be possible, not nearly as simple as this

Technical side I'm not so much interested in, I got into bitcoin because of my first hand knowledge of how insecure traditional currency systems are... I used to be an atm tecnician, drove armored cars, and now I write and manage insurance policies on said institutions, and know outright my money isn't nearly as safe as people like to believe
