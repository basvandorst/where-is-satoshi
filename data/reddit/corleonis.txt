MultiBit developers have sold it to Keepkey so it's rather them pushing their product over TREZOR, not Jim neither Gary, original fathers of MultiBit
At the takeover we have been assured that this won't happen and that TREZOR support in MultiBit will stay fully functional.

oh very nice list, thank you, however my problem is still not solved.
I need to pay a merchant in the US, he doesn't accept bitcoin, I do not use Paypal and I refuse to use my credit card for security reasons (+ you don't want voodoo dolls on your bank statement :o)
 - pay bills &gt;&gt;&gt; EU only
 - pay bills   &gt;&gt;&gt; EU only
 - pay bills &gt;&gt;&gt; Canada only
 - pay bills, receive wages, recharge phones credit &gt;&gt;&gt; maybe, their website doesn't say anything
 - recharge your phone credit &gt;&gt;&gt; phone credit only, although seems to work globally
 &gt;&gt;&gt; payroll and Germany only
  &gt;&gt;&gt; AU
 &gt;&gt;&gt; payroll only
 &gt;&gt;&gt; payroll and EU + AU + PH + CH, but no USA
There's really nothing like that in the US?

it is obviously not our wish to have false copies of the device circulating, that's why producing the same or similar casing (that could be misleadingly taken for original)  for commercial or promotional purposes without our agreement is not allowed.
otherwise whoever wants to play with the hw for his own use or for the benefit of the project, he's welcome to do so. 
if someone comes up with a good proposal for next generation of the hw incl. casing, that we will agree to use, we'll be happy to reward him. 
the proposal must be technically and financially feasible (no rocket science please :) and must follow our safety standards.

Hi, the graphics look good and thanks for sharing. But Id like to point a few things and advocate for hardware wallets because it seems you've missed out this part of recent development which makes many points in the graphics obsolete.
The Hardware wallet concept is based on having a separate device to store coins offline AND sign transactions.
Trezor is the only working hardware wallet on the market currently so I will use its properties to explain that you can actually make bitcoins secure and user friendly with only one or two advise.
To your points:
 
- never store wallet address and priv. key in the same place
SOLVED BY HW  WALLET:
private keys are completely separated from the environment, never leave the device
- only use own PC / mobile
I would not consider this a good security advise once it is my mothers windows pc for example :)
SOLVED BY HW WALLET
just use any internet cafe computer, with viruses and keyloggers whatever, and you're still fine with trezor
- split holdings and use multiple wallets
yes why not, always good to distribute risk, protect privacy etc.
it's fine to have a mobile app for small spendings and for the rest you have.. you already know what im gonna say :)
also, for splitting holdings check the passphrase encryption by trezor
- periodic offline backup
most users never do. and bitcoin newbies learn the hard way. so why not skip the necessity &gt; BIP32 == no periodic backup needed, just keep your mnemonic seed safe (recovery seed)
 
- 3rd party wallet encryption
 
and my mother could never do that
- update online wallet
good point to update online wallets, desktop wallets and the hardware wallet firmware as well
- paper backups in a safe place
this + the updates is actually everything a common user needs to do :) with a HW wallet
End note: buying from the "big" is contrary to what is stated above - 12+ big hacked...
Insurance in the banks is not free at all, and usually is limited up to a certain small amount. also having multiple bank accounts results in more expensive management etc. meanwhile a hardware wallet holds unlimited accounts for you.  
and PS:
I think Armory is not a hardware wallet. It is strongly focused on security but it is a desktop client.
 
@_date: 2014-06-23 17:37:56
its ok to repeat. newbies might be reading so why not. anyway storing offline is good until the point one wants to spend them.. 
@_date: 2014-07-03 14:07:31
what about a reverse service? accept euro and convert to btc?
@_date: 2014-07-29 02:48:24
Simple and secure is not having to do any backups.
just use the Trezor hardware wallet.
Its really time to make things simple in bitcoin.

@_date: 2014-12-03 17:28:18
It is our goal to go down with the price with time, of course. 
Current owners (like you) are early adopters, trend setters, so called Innovators. It is a small % of users who set trends and are ready to bear a higher cost because the believe in the technology.
We as a team did not accept any VC funding in order to maintain our independent position for early stages of a security device like Trezor. I believe next year we will be able to produce and distribute Trezor at lower price. 
@_date: 2014-11-30 05:00:00
I believe implementing HD wallet structure and support for hardware wallets like the Trezor is demanding but would allow you to focus more on services. Less trouble with security for all parties.
@_date: 2014-12-22 12:03:17
please could you move Trezor to Securing your Bitcoins as Trezor was primarily designed to secure bitcoins? thx
@_date: 2014-12-08 18:04:17
@_date: 2014-12-10 12:38:02
Reading this of course :)
Ethical hackers are a gem and should be [rewarded](
We keep on repeating "Do not give your private keys to 3rd parties!" and some people still think it's just a marketing claim. 
Anyway, I'm quite proud that there are people like Johoe. 
But next time it can be some Badhoe. 
@_date: 2014-08-04 09:25:41
that was no sarcasm at all. trezor is designed to be safe in infected environment. it has  some crucial advantages to using web or desktop wallets alone.  
@_date: 2014-12-03 21:03:21
I'm sorry for this but most probably that's not an issue of the TREZOR device but rather of the backend.

That's why we did Trezor. So people do not have to think this way anymore. Bitcoin is private money. It's yours! 
@_date: 2014-12-16 19:44:07
It's as you say, the priv key is generated by Trezor itself. 
The initial setup can be done via  (soon through other wallets as well).
* label your device
* set PIN
* set additional passphrase encyption - if you want
* write down the recovery seed - it's your paper backup of the master private key
That's it. Only takes a few minutes.

Lots of new features can be introduced to current TREZOR hardware via firmware update, such as message encryption/decryption, identity/password management, etc. and these features are certainly coming.
As for the hardware part, we believe that the current composition is the most secure we can have (no internet connectivity, fingerprint readers etc.) so maybe the only change would be to enlarge the display. 
We might introduce more colors. For example pink :) 
Anybody interested in pink?

Hope this working material about bitcoin security with Trezor can be useful:
it is not a final version so feel free to comment if something is not clear or missing.
@_date: 2014-12-16 13:50:01
The basic principle of Trezor is: the private keys are generated in a secure environment and never touch anything else. Any device with internet connectivity can be compromised and should be seen as not trustworthy when it comes to your money.

Im sorry to see another sad story. Current Bitcoin tools did not yet evolve to the level of Bitcoin itself. 
We own bitcoins but have to hand them over to another "banks" or trust some thousands of programmers who did all the software stack on our computers....
Email addresses are one of main weakpoints in bitcoin security. That's why I think myTrezor and trezor are an amazing combo. 
myTrezor requires no logins, passwords, emails, nothing that potentially could be misused. The beauty in the concept is that all the security work is done in a trezor device - literally in your hands.  
That's where your coins belong, not your computer drive, neither external services.. 
@_date: 2014-11-30 20:08:56
for a simple reason
you can't be sure to use coins from a paper wallet securely
as riplin said, Trezor actually generates a paper wallet (it's called the recovery seed) but that wallet never touches a potentially hacked computer
@_date: 2014-09-24 18:40:04
Trezor is currently working on multisig.
@_date: 2014-06-14 08:57:45
Sorry to see another bitcoin novice losing his coins. Must be discouraging from using btc which itself is a great tool. But dont worry even the matadors have failed to protect against loss, theft.. because the infrastructure we use is vulnerable. Or just because the systems allow us to make mistakes. 
check out  which will be available in summer finally. Our team has been designing that for 1.5 years to help people not to lose coins anymore.
@_date: 2014-10-23 12:47:36
You dont actually need a multisig for this. Simply use an HD wallet that generates a mnemonic seed like a Trezor with additional passphrase encryption.
Write down your recovery seed into the will and make sure a copy of the recovery seed is not lying around your house.
Set up passphrases to create hidden volumes and transfer whatever amounts to them. 
Give one passphrase to your wife
another passphrase to your son
and/or another passphrase to whoever you want to get your bitcoins
Everyone gets exactly the amount of bitcoins that are under their trezor volume.

Carsten, your cards look really good :)
@_date: 2014-06-27 20:35:20
yes, trezor is using deterministic wallets (BIP0032), which means:
- when the device is lost/broken, it's current balance as well as the entire transaction history can be either recovered to a new device or a trezor-compatible wallet
- no need for regular backups of private keys.. yay! :)
@_date: 2014-09-09 08:33:54
TREZOR’s security model is based on the principle of zero trust.
@_date: 2014-03-12 14:49:56
the trezor software is opensource so everybody who understands programming can inspect if trezor is doing what it's supposed to do and nothing else.
unlike  with computers or mobiles with lots of proprietary software, there is no such thing as a Trezor Inc having a possibility to include backdoors to trezor.
@_date: 2014-12-04 00:43:55
Trezor is not the only condition to meet for Bitcoin adoption. Relative price stability, Bitcoin based economy, political environment, secure tools, new applications etc. But it's coming, be patient or contribute.

you can create a lot of amazing things and services on top of the bitcoin protocol. its much more than just money and investment opportunity. mainly its a transaction system.
you can as well create / derive you own currency from it.
why? maybe you want to support a local economy while enjoying the ease of transactions and safety benefits of the cryptocurrency. so you create moonhorsecoins (MHC) and convince just enough people around your village to start using it. instead of printing small papers, physical coins or carrying some paper books to collect points, you just have your MHC mobile wallets. you pay for the bread and you sign contract with your neighbor with MHC. no additional taxes go to the capital where it stays, no money outflaws to the international corporations owning all your retail stores around you. What you create stays at home. A global tool applied locally.

not at all, your coins are in your Trezor, not in our website. The website is only an interface to let you see your transactions, set up the device and prepare transactions for signature.
there are more wallets working on trezor integration so you should be able to choose elecrum or multibit or blockchain or greenaddress or wallet32 or.... :) whoever implements the standards that are already in Trezor.

First of all thanks for putting your time to write some educational document. I think whoever wants to reuse it as is should reward your effort with a tip.
 
Now, I really did just a fast reading so sorry if I'm not catching some important points BUT here's just a few reasons why I can't re-use it as is if I wanted to educate merchants around me:
- our local market needs translation (as many others) but that's not a big issue
- I haven't noticed book-keeping advise, I know its not an easy topic and definitely again not possible to do for all markets. But they will be asking. 
- I don't see much point in comparing gold with BTC and cash in this case. Gold would be a good way to go for a small investors advise. For merchants it probably makes more sense to compare typical means of payment: cash, credit/debit cards and bitcoin. (vouchers in some countries are popular as well) 
- since I've been working in financial advisory business for more than 12 years, there is one showstopper in the document for me. 
I couldn't put my name on saying that "There are no disadvantages, costs or risks involved accepting Bitcoin as a method of payment". 
Costs - btc is definitely the winner here, but there are some (if its only the 1% payment processor fee). I understand the positive marketing behind, but you might as well get a negative reactions - from the merchant or authorities..
Unless the merchant happens to be one of the first Trezor hardware wallet owners ( I doubt :)), how can they be sure to protect their bitcoins against being stolen or lost if they have to rely on some external wallet or payment processing service, a possibly vulnerable computer and they are far from being security experts. 
My point is if we wan't to support Bitcoin acceptance, we should give a trustworthy advise and Always make them aware of the potential risks and pitfalls. Otherwise the trust is gone and bad publicity produced the first time they fail to backup their wallet.
 
There are other risks as well. Especially exchange rate volatility, which partly can be solved by using a payment processor right. 
Please consider to include one thought: Use the merchant's business network to help the bitcoin economy grow. 
I mean an economy that does not need the banks. So maybe next step for the merchant is: see if his employees are interested in earning part of their loan in btc. Or convince his own suppliers to accept bitcoins as well. 
Again I really appreciate when people do not wait for others but are actively doing something for the growth of Bitcoin. 
Hope you can find some inspiration in what I just wrote for your next edit. cheers

You might still forget the optional passphrase when using Trezor, but since it is a device you'd use more often than a cold storage, the risk is probably much smaller.
If you forget the PIN for Trezor, nevermind because you should have the recovery seed.
Anyway, you are right that with Trezor things get much easier.

I worked in banking/insurance industry where at least in my country you have very few women in higher management positions. It didnt hold me back from becoming an expert in my field, delivering great results and eventually get the recognition and money i deserved.
i entered bitcoin when very few women were professionally involved and again i dont care, im doing my best again.
so this is an individual issue, not gender related.
it is true though that showing up at a conference might be funny, especially when some people assume i am an assistant of my colleagues to be surprised that im actually not.
I wouldnt waste my time thinking about even chances. Id rather think about making bitcoin available for those who have less understanding of security and programming. Be it a woman or my grandfather.

But even if you don't expect to see a rising BTC exchange rate, there's still a value missing: passwords and identities protection that Trezor is implementing in near future.
Would that justify the price for you?
@_date: 2014-12-03 20:52:29
I believe many have tried/are trying, which is good. Our code is opensource so vulnerabilities would be detected and fixed fast.
You can try to crack trezor with [this]( and I think it might give in. :)

not needed and insecure imo
@_date: 2014-10-23 20:59:18
NO, not at all.
As said, you need to enable the additional passphrase encryption.
That's how the lawyer won't be able to access the coins with purely having the recovery seed. He would need the additional passphrases to open hidden volumes where all the coins are.
OK you might imagine your lawyer sleeps with your wife but that's an ugly scenario even for your bank account :}

@_date: 2014-12-03 17:21:54
We believe the potential of TREZOR goes way beyond bitcoin and altcoins. 
So before jumping into another new product, we'd like to focus on Trezor as **identity and password management tool**.

Please give Trezor a try. You'll see that it's a simple way for a common computer user.

get a Trezor:
- easy to use, no mistakes to make
- top secure for storing AND spending bitcoins
- no keyloggers and hacker attacks can empty your wallet
- will be on sales by end of july
@_date: 2014-06-23 18:14:46
Id add that the trezor team contributed to several developments that are helping everybody, not just their product.. Some BIPs have been created while working on trezor. And then the code is opensource so if you want to build a better one you're free to do so, just skip more than 1.5 years of development and invent some good addition to it.
There are many other developers who are working on bitcoin for years and were not paid for most of the work.

Any web wallet that is compatible with Trezor
@_date: 2014-10-23 20:46:45
* I want to purchase bitcoins and start using them. What is currently the best method for doing so?
Best is to start earning them, really. I dont know what you do but think about it.
* Should I store them on my computer? (keyloggers, hard drive crashes, malware) Should I store them on an online wallet? (giving up control of my bitcoins to a third party). What measures should I take to secure my ownership? (BitGo, USB key etc.)
I can recommend TREZOR only.
* Can someone convince me that entering a Bitcoin exchange is safe?
Depending on where you are there might be a bitcoin ATM or some localbitcoin dealer. Personally I do not trust any web wallet or exchange with my coins. 
* How easily can I convert bitcoins back into USD in the US?
again best with some 2way ATM or sell to some friend. 
@_date: 2014-03-10 11:37:51
I wonder why entrust your money to another service that you can't control? 
The basic property of Bitcoin is decentralization. By giving control to somebody else, you might as well end up a victim to another fraud, hack or moods of the authorities. Believing that banks can handle the security properly is a bit naive. You might not know when a traditional bank loses your money.
They can hold a limited % of the proclaimed holdings (fractional reserve banking). 
It is not the case of bitcoin, you can't simply say, oops btc gone, here's another one instead. 
On the contrary with Bitcoin I think for once people have the opportunity to learn to handle the security and keep what they have in their hands.
@_date: 2014-11-29 17:19:37
Although, there's one web wallet that I can use with complete peace of mind -
Otherwise no reason to entrust my private keys to ANY third party.

@_date: 2014-07-03 23:04:28
you need a Trezor and an android with USB OTG 
both exist
you need a trezor compatible android app 
wallet32 on the way
and you really need internet connection
otherwise how can your wallet interact with the blockchain?
a merchant usually has some wireless unless you have a connection in your phone
@_date: 2014-12-04 01:07:40


The device is equipped with a **fingerprint scanner** and a **camera** to ensure access, keys to access wallets are **embedded in a device**, located on a specific **server** and stored in cold storage (access to each key is secured by different layers of authentication).
Because the device is **GSM-enabled**, the wallet can be used in over 60 countries, and since it can **fit in your pocket** (phone?)..."
I don't know... We prefer to avoid potential weakpoints and difficulty where possible.

periodic backups? 
a common pc user is not used to do. i was just posting somewhere else - just skip periodic backups by using a BIP32 compliant wallet. 
I think the only way to make Bitcoin safe is to REDUCE number of user actions required and make tools stupid-proof, allowing no mistakes.
@_date: 2014-12-01 21:22:52
I hope you have fun while watching this cartoon because there's a simple answer to your question: Trezor is the most secure way today AND the easiest.
I recommend to keep just a small change in your phone. 
btw.: Trezor actually creates a paper wallet, it's called the Recovery seed.
@_date: 2014-09-08 17:05:43
btw. a flintstone edition would be nice :) anybody skilled with stone?

The invoiced amount is divided into 19 for hardware and 100 USD for data security service, for a simple reason. Many of our users live in countries with very restrictive  customs and we wanted to make things as smooth as possible for them.
@_date: 2014-02-22 17:03:25
Operators should be using bulletproof computers and networks and their staff should be perfectly trained but we have seen big banks failing to secure simple data although hey have invested a lot in security. So I would not bet on any external service to entirely secure my holdings.
The worst risk for individuals is their own computer prone to be full of malware.
To trick an address is easy, but the payment protocol should be a solution. I think Bitpay has recently implemented it, we at TREZOR plan to do so as well. 
@_date: 2014-07-03 13:50:35
Nice idea but I guess not feasible. At least the laws in my country prohibit you to deny accepting official currency. Dont know about US but Id imagine some similar approach.
So you can only say I accept bitcoins and if you want to pay in fiat then I charge more. OR by paying with btc you get this extra something
@_date: 2014-03-03 03:11:56
You can "reconctruct your money" when lost. 
to make a good comparison, you have a TREZOR hardware wallet for bitcoins that gets stolen. No big deal, you recover the entire holdings as well as transaction history to a new trezor wallet.
Impossible to do with a stolen purse.
@_date: 2014-06-27 19:55:43
depends on the current value of btc.. :) 
@_date: 2014-07-01 18:39:07
trezor is perfect for any amount you want to keep safe/send securely.
To make small purchases in a B&amp;M store, just use your mobile app, usually its just a beer or a dinner. 
If you want to buy a luxury car or a computer you want to be sure everything goes well and won't pay from your mobile phone anyway :)
It is the same principle as walking around with a few bucks in your pocket, but keeping your monthly earnings, your savings and investments in a safe place.
this doesnt exclude any POS or ATMs being compatible with trezor though so we might see that soon as well.. 
@_date: 2014-12-22 10:10:23
Maybe it was a mistake to call myTrezor  a web wallet...
It is a very different web wallet to all others. 
It gets NO access to private keys + it requires NO user credentials, so there is no way to hack your web wallet account through email recovery or using your passwords from some stolen database...
All it does is displaying the balance and broadcasting transactions signed by your Trezor.

That's true. At least try to have them memorize just one word. All the rest is a question of letting them know what to do when it is needed.

@_date: 2014-02-27 08:50:17
Thanks for the quote. 
What I wanted to point out that there are failures like this but we need to concentrate on more important things. Of course its a question of some mutual respect to not be asking people for their time while not giving them an opportunity to being stated correctly in return.

I'd suggest adding two simple rules for the average PC users that are scared by words like Tor or router:
* use Trezor
* + what you already mentioned - never give your passwords, PINs and recovery seeds to ANYONE
@_date: 2014-12-12 20:48:42
Trezor is primarily not meant to be carried around although many people do because it's small (the long side of Trezor shorter than the short side of a credit card), light 12 grams and quite durable. 
For small spendings around town, a mobile app or paper wallet can do what you need. 
@_date: 2014-06-28 01:46:04

this is the entire setup + receiving and sending coins, adding accounts, discovering multisend etc.  
 
@_date: 2014-12-19 21:41:31
Even a person who never touched any bitcoin wallet  can set it up within minutes and navigate through the interface. 
Also, there is no login to mytrezor.com. You just connect Trezor to your computer in order to send BTC. When you are done sending bitcoins, you can disconnect and decide to leave it in the Watch only mode, or let your browser completely Forget the device and show a blank page. In the Watch only you can create Receive addresses and see updates to you balance.
@_date: 2014-11-29 17:37:34

@_date: 2014-12-16 04:47:37
Should that happen you can recover your entire holdings and the transaction history into a new device or a compatible wallet.
You can't screw much here. There are just few imperatives with Trezor:
 
* Keep the recovery seed (paper backup) safe.
* Choose a good PIN.
* If you enable a passphrase don't forget it.
@_date: 2014-12-08 15:23:15
there's one obvious difference. hw1 has no display and buttons like Trezor. 
As trivial as it may seem, this difference makes a huge gap between hose two.
With Trezor you simply know what you are signing, you can verify the amount, the address and the fee. 
I guess you can not sign and verify text with hw1, neither use it as identity/password manager which is planned for Trezor. 
@_date: 2014-08-03 14:16:20
no no no :))) dont write your passphrase next to the recovery seed. 
@_date: 2014-07-08 22:24:54
Lol :)
I guess with how smart trezor is and having a micro on top of it, it might as well commit suicide
@_date: 2014-12-18 03:05:37
Generating private key is happening offline.
The setup is much easier online and enables us to keep the Trezor tiny (without large keyboard prone to hardware failure)
In the process of setup you can chose your PIN in a secure way protected against keyloggers and define the length of your recovery seed (24 words recommended)
@_date: 2014-10-08 17:18:59
1. All transactions are stored in the blockchain. When you connect Trezor to an online computer and open mytrezor.com, the xpub (public key) of your trezor recalls transactions associated with it from the blockchain. (technically from the backend server provided by Bits of Proof)
2. there is no device ID and thus SatoshiLabs can't know who owns how many bitcoins. Also, using mytrezor.com requires no personal information such as username, email etc that might be linked with your identity.
3. not with another webwallet YET, but with electrum, wallet32, others are working on adding Trezor 
@_date: 2014-02-22 23:12:29

The basic idea of Entropy is nice but it's only secure in theory because it allows mistakes. 
The printer's issue has been discussed before, but using the coins safely is another story.
It is I think for people who have advanced skills and know well how to handle private/public keys, imports/swiping etc.
Don't laugh, I know this is all peanuts for you, but for the most people, even the format of the bitcoin address looks totally obscure.
Even for a more advanced user its much nicer to have one device that does it all : Trezor that generates unlimited number of private addresses offline + needs no printer nor additional knowledge + makes secure transactions on top of it all. While still being absolutely user-friendly.
Of course the absolutely best solution for an average user would be a secure solution integrated into a mobile phone. But that's impossible with current mobile technologies.

trezor is a BIP32 hierarchical deterministic structure wallet, that means it generates a master private key from which all other private keys are derrived.
that allows you to have umlimited number of sepparate accounts on one Trezor device

@_date: 2014-12-03 17:50:24
Thank you I am not the technical "guy" here but the one responsible for business.
As said, we'd like to come down with the sales price as soon as possible. But a price of a device does NOT only consist of the hardware parts:
If I had to create a simplified equation for the pricing, then the price of Trezor has to cover all this:
hardware development + components + hardware certification + 2 years of R&amp;D + offices + lawyers + support team + future production batch + marketing + taxes (aaargh!) + hopefully some profit too :)
@_date: 2014-08-02 01:57:27
The USB issue is getting a little bit lost in the media shortcuts saying "Every USB Device Under Threat".
The flaw concerns a USB Host (=computer) and not a USB Client (=TREZOR). 
To explain, some specially adapted USB clients can get your computer under control and not the other way around. 
To apply in our context, TREZOR can't be controlled by a computer.
@_date: 2014-12-03 19:22:23

1. trezor shares 5% of each new sales with their users through affiliate program. that's probably better than receiving a one-time small discount. 7.5% for early adopters.
2. airport checks should not be a problem.
@_date: 2014-06-28 08:33:07
If you need some now there's nothing really seamless and intuitive whixh is annoying.. sending emails writing things down having to remember stuff. If your colleague is an expert its ok. But  Trezor should be preparing a multisig - and if it's the same like everything else from them then it will be a game changer. No eta for the multisig function but the devices will be on sale end of july.

Erik i felt the same when i gave an interview to a bloomberg journalist Olga trying to explain the pros and cons of different ways of securing bitcoins by individuals, explaining patiently why TREZOR might make a difference to btc usability and giving different scenarios for her to understand the risks. At the end all she wrote was that a czech company called SatoshiLabs is working on a small device with a display and two buttons.. when i asked her to at least more accurately call it a TREZOR she refused because "thats not the companys name". Well there are moments when you feel desperately losing time but hey look on your contribution si far compared to the contribution of an article like this that will be forgotten latest...tomorrow id guess.
@_date: 2014-11-29 18:24:05
That's true. 
But he most probably won't get onto your bitcoins anyway.
And you'll be able to recover your bitcoins to another device or another wallet.
@_date: 2014-06-25 22:15:52
You're right in a way. Unfortunately, the entire infrastructure we are using is not secure as Bitcoin and we need some secure and intuitive tool that can be used by everybody.
And then, I cannot really count all direct expenses I've had so far with banks. But I'm quite sure that they are much much higher than a one time expense to secure my own money.
@_date: 2014-12-19 21:46:24
There's a discounted Multipack of 3 devices. "One for me, one for you and one as a fast backup option".. :)
@_date: 2014-11-23 09:56:38
MultiBit HD should be a really good try. It will allow you to have private keys on Trezor and have all the wallet data encrypted by it.
@_date: 2014-06-25 20:12:30
Again, wait for bitcointrezor.com to be on sales and you wont have to do paper backups of your keys anymore. 
Just keep the initial seed that you can use later to make a recovery.
you will have a secure storage + transactions made safely. With paper you only have the first part solved.
@_date: 2015-05-06 10:19:42
I don't carry bitcoins with me. My bitcoins are in the blockchain. What I do carry is basically a "password to my bitcoin accounts" = the private keys...

You rock!
@_date: 2014-06-25 19:28:19
Using email recovery for passwords is a security weakpoint in general.
Get a trezor once its out for sales. You forget pin but still have the recovery seed to setup again.
The only case when this wont help is if on top if the pin protection you encrypt the device and forget the passphrase - but thats the purpose of it.
@_date: 2014-12-03 19:41:58

and you'll get a chance :))
hope you got the invitation..
@_date: 2014-03-12 17:20:50
There is quite a good protection against consequences of a physical theft of the Trezor.
What you are suggesting is similar to a "Wipe" in Trezor. Wipe removes all private data from the device. Later you can make a recovery from your recovery seed (which was generated during the initialization process).
But there is also an interesting advanced option of a passphrase encryption (on top of the PIN protection). Unless you enter the correct passphrase, you will only see an empty wallet. You can have many passphrases encrypting many different wallets inside one Trezor device.
@_date: 2014-12-22 10:22:08

congratz on the development, the new site looks good :)
I've seen the bitcoincard product website which might be outdated
 anyway it states:


 
is there any way to protect against this? some recovery option?


can you explain how?


which seems cool but how does the other person know I really have the coins I'm sending to him, if he cannot instantly verify confirmations of the tx?


Does it mean if I don't synchronize I wont know the balance OR I wont send/receive transactions?
Also, how do I know that I can trust a gateway running some custom software?
How does bitcoincard handle change addresses?
Regarding ATM:
it says it's two ways but no cash deposit slot in the render...
do you also have a working prototype or you will OEM from some other producer?

@_date: 2015-01-22 21:59:57
You are right. Whoever reaches for a cheap copy should be aware that the service and warranty won't be an easy thing to get. 
Plus we are not speaking here about an mp3 player but a "bank" to protect money. 
@_date: 2016-03-11 11:16:21
This is a great news, thanks for sharing.
And luckilly, it's not about bitcoin vs blockchain :)

I guarantee you will be able to set up and use TREZOR easily. I did :) as well as a girl who never touched bitcoins before.
Just open the box and go to mytrezor.com. You'll be guided through everything.
@_date: 2015-01-27 21:35:35

We don't have a markup. Te exchange rate on  is changing automatically once per hour and the rate is taken from bitstamp. But you are right, until btc is bound to fiat money, it will still incur extra costs. In any case, those costs in total are much smaller than costs for a fiat account, at least in our country.
@_date: 2015-01-23 16:38:09
:) its not easy to get used to a new number obviously... we'll correct that asap :) thanks
@_date: 2014-12-10 22:56:01
I see, yes you are right but the point is to minimize the digital risk. I know that blockchain.info and all other big wallet operators are working a lot to protect their users, no doubt about that.
If separating private keys from the environment eliminates a large portion of risk, then it's worth doing it. 
Also in my understanding, this is in line with the basic philosophy of Bitcoin as private money.
We still need to have the payment protocol implemented.. and create very intuitive tools so mistakes can be hardly done by users etc..
And I'm sure there will be always be ways to steal bitcoins as there are ways to scam people with fiat money, but much more limited and rather based on user error than technical issue.

I'm from [SatoshiLabs]( 
We strongly believe that sharing brings a faster development to the society. We also believe in free market and fair competition.  
The opensource is there to not to have reinvent the wheel, but to build new stuff faster.  
We have open-sourced the 2 years of our work and actively encourage everyone to develop new features **on top** of our Trezor code.
I would not bother asking for what's their innovation, but because he stated that *innovation starts from cloning* I'd like to see their innovation after cloning Trezor. There is none now but might be in the future. Really curious If it's something good, we will gladly merge it to our code for Trezor users and give you public credits.
If you don't plan on doing anything with the code, fair to be open about that and I will hope that you will at least maintain the good reputation of hw wallets we have been working so hard on.

Docker needs root privileges for its own operating. Using "sudo docker run" is normal even in production.
(slush here :).
@_date: 2015-01-23 16:30:42
Congratulations and enjoy your TREZOR :)
If you have an Android, don't forget to download the myTREZOR Lite App.
Next time you pass by the ATM, you can create a fresh receiving address for your new btc going directly to the safety of your Trezor. 
@_date: 2015-01-18 19:11:46
He is probably using additional passphrase (in advanced options in TREZOR setup). The passphrase is needed for full recovery, without it, the seed is useless.
@_date: 2015-01-16 12:47:36
yes correct
@_date: 2015-01-07 20:03:08
There are people who wish to have a Trezor before they buy their first btc...
There will be a way do buy Trezor for USD soon.
@_date: 2015-01-20 21:35:02
The true reason for this size is I said we can't produce anything that wouldn't fit in my small clutch purses :)
@_date: 2015-01-09 20:01:53
the paper for recovery seed is not very soft and quite small.. unless you use a different than provided in the package, the risk of losing it this way is quite small. :) 
@_date: 2015-01-27 21:25:34
We opensourced for two reasons:
1. so people dont have to reinvent the wheel when they want to build NEW things on top of Trezor
2. so people can verify that Trezor does what we say it's supposed to do
@_date: 2016-01-25 11:16:09
haha no it is really just an internal wordplay :)
@_date: 2015-05-06 13:41:29

no bank can multi-spend your bitcoins, devalue them, charge back or withold, decide not to send, decide of how much you can and cannot transfer, ask you what you want to do with your money when you want to withdraw it, as they do with traditional money. I'm talking about fractional reserve banking, targeted inflation and quantitative easing, political sanctions or regulatory restrictions, bad moods or mistakes of bankers etc. 
YOU own the money. 
not a bank, 
not a state, 
not an organisation. 
well and unless you willingly entrust your bitcoins to a third party (like to an exchange, a web wallet or any other service which you do not control), then it's only you who really owns your bitcoins.
YOU decide on how when a why to spend it.
@_date: 2016-01-14 08:05:25
Hi Felix, many greetings from SatoshiLabs. We've been thinking of you wondering where you are and how you are doing. Glad to see another life sign of you :) good luck with the rest of your trip!
@_date: 2016-01-11 10:05:03
you can create your own background, go to beta.mytrezor.com and you'll find it when you go to Trezor settings

Most of the hardware we use today needs occasional software updates. Firmware updates ensure security, bring new features and enhancements to the current ones. 
Updating the firmware signed by SatoshiLabs is secure and each update can be verified by comparing the fingerprint.
If you want to dig deeper, you can verify the build yourself: 
Any other firmware than the official by SatoshiLabs triggers a warning on your Trezor's display that shows up each time you plug the device in. 
You can be sure that it's secure and in your best interest to do the updates. The code is opensource and we have some of the brightest cryptographers looking into it:  
@_date: 2016-06-05 19:51:44
thanks so much :)
@_date: 2016-06-20 15:48:13
thanks for your support.. Trezor team is continuously working on new features and has a much wider use than any other hw wallets. 
@_date: 2016-06-27 14:36:17
As SatoshiLabs' CEO I confirm that in-ear.com is our reselling partner for TREZOR.
We are redesigning our eshop and will put up a list of our resellers there when ready. 
@_date: 2016-06-20 15:33:36
MultiBit used to be great but now that they have sold the wallet, I'd rather recommend to get a Trezor 
- like that you'll always keep  the private keys to your BTC in your hands 
- and you can chose any of the Trezor compatible wallets as interface - desktop, web or mobile: 
(note I work with Trezor and my advise may be biased, so do your own research)
@_date: 2016-06-03 18:45:38
not at all.. it's more like using the blockchain but keeping the private keys to your valuables in your Trezor
@_date: 2016-06-07 23:49:51
This isn't putting your bitcoins at risk at all. The cryptography used for Password Manager has been in TREZOR before.
@_date: 2016-06-07 12:11:43
Quite a few differences..
You can verify on a trusted TREZOR display that you are actually logging into the correct website. Yubikey signs just about "anything" so you can be easily tricked to a phishing site and give away your credentials.
Unlike standard "login tokens" you can easily recover TREZOR in case you'd lose it. 
Also, TREZOR has a PIN that protects you against unauthorized access when you leave is somewhere. The PIN entry itself is keylogger-proof.
Simply put, Yubikey is only a second factor authenticator.
@_date: 2016-06-07 12:52:09
I recommend Trezor. Nothing is more secure. (I'm biased though so feel free to ask around :)
Trezor is compatible with a dozen other wallets and bitcoin services: 
@_date: 2017-01-26 01:16:37
don't worry, you are only slightly above the average number of trezors/person.  I have met people who own 6-8 trezors.
@_date: 2016-06-03 19:55:46
Yes, you need your Trezor and the good news is you don't need to have your computer. It's great for traveling, or when you lose/break your computer..
There is no additional setup for the TREZOR device required.
To start with TREZOR Password Manager, you need to add a Chrome Extension and link it to your Dropbox account. 
Accessing and editing your passwords always requires user confirmation with the button o his device. This encrypts or decrypts your passwords on a one-by-one basis, always using unique private keys.
@_date: 2016-06-05 19:48:07
We plan to add the import/export feature after the release is stable and well tested.
@_date: 2016-06-03 19:46:31

you can create a new dropbox just for this purpose with a new email = not disclose your identity
@_date: 2016-11-29 18:24:35
Thank you Bobby
I can imagine the security here is pretty demanding, and not just for the technical part, but mainly for the human risk. The private keys are always touching some people's hands, so basically your clients have to trust your company in any case. 
What would happen if a client purchases a high denomination and then discovers in few years, that the btc from the chip are gone? What's the extent your legal liability or the warranty / claim process? 
This is something I'd like to help you market this.
Does the coin come with a manual on how to swipe?
thx again, 
Alena (SatoshiLabs/TREZOR) 
@_date: 2016-11-24 14:52:13
Hello Bobby, firstly thank you for your continuous and always improving service (and now goods too :). You and your company continue to impress me.
I'm particularly interested in security of bitcoin in Mint collectibles. Can you please describe the measures you have in place?
Also, what is the legal/accounting status of your coins (especially higher denominations) when importing to EU/US markets?

hi great summary!
Just ad Trezor, the default fee is priority fee and user can opt-out to a basic miner fee, and I believe adding another option or changing the current priority fee amount won't be an issue

Thats not true.. count in shipping costs and the fact you need a new non-compromised computer.. also prices stated in euro seem optically smaller than usd.

@_date: 2015-04-23 12:24:44
The hologram sticker is there so you can see this is a real TREZOR and not a copy
The box is glued well on both sides so is someone tries to open without you noticing, he will fail.
In any case, the security of your TREZOR is not built around packaging, but around the locked bootloader and firmware that - IF not original from SatoshiLabs, it will show on the display every time you run the device.
@_date: 2015-09-24 19:42:29
it's coming..
@_date: 2015-04-24 13:04:44
Thanks very nice thorough review! 
to the author: one thing though - I have to second You should better create a new seed and send your coins there. 
to everyone reading this - DO NOT save the seed on your computer, mobile phone, camera, or make printed copies, ever. 
Rather have several paper backups (hand-written) stored in safe places.
Also if you could delete that sentence from the review to avoid giving wrong example... would be awesome!

:) I was wondering if someone will ask.. 
@_date: 2015-04-29 21:25:08
hmm, would you rather get a cheap PC (how much is that?) which is 
big, not comfortable for spending and probably backdoored? If you are a security expert, you should know better than me that a single purpose device will do a better job. Also you won't be able to use the computer for authentication against websites..
Give Trezor a try. If you don't like it and return within 15 days, I'll cover your returning costs personally.
@_date: 2015-04-01 15:13:01
Hmm not sure about iOS..
But if someone looks for an Android-Trezor watch only there's myTrezor Lite allowing you to scan the xpub of ONE Trezor account. Not saying it's the "bestest" but it works.

First you read that Nr 1 risk factor in money laundering are BANKS
(the last of the list are virtual currencies) 
and then ECB comes with a complete absurdity like
...given that terrorists and other criminal groups are currently able to transfer money within virtual currency networks by concealing the transfers or by benefiting from a certain degree of anonymity on such exchange platforms. The use of virtual currencies also poses greater risks than traditional means of payment in the sense that the transferability of virtual currency relies on the internet ....

@_date: 2016-10-19 17:12:41
I believe this is the first step of the integration and a login with Trezor should follow. The question is rather when.. Let's hope Bitstamp's dev team can prioritize this soon.
@_date: 2016-10-28 13:07:41
it's evolution I'd say. 
Something even Google dropped once they realized its weaknesses,
today their own employees only use U2F tokens
@_date: 2015-11-24 20:02:57
Well thanks I take it as a compliment (dont know why you're being downvoted). But I certainly hope I have other - rather professional qualities relevant for the bitcoin space :)
@_date: 2016-10-19 17:13:00
I agree. It should come at a later stage.
@_date: 2016-10-20 12:48:40
nope, you select an address for withdrawal, no xpub shared.
but I think using xpub would be in fact a better way - you could have a separate TREZOZR account for Bitstamp only and not worry about privacy 
@_date: 2015-11-24 18:58:12
Well, there are even lists of Women in Bitcoin. 
Nevermind sexism. It's a waste of time.
@_date: 2015-11-24 20:29:09
There's some logic though to what I guess wants to say:
Men, typically because of their technical education and analytic approach tend to be the ones to invent. Just by looking into SatoshiLabs team, all developers are guys. All girls are there to organize, communicate etc.
Women, because they usually have less technical but more humanistic education and/or practical approach, tend to be the ones to make things look nice and easy to use. For example, if it was up to our (male) developers only to create Trezor, many of our users would have difficulties understanding the technical (otherwise correct) terms.
This i a bit offtopic to the AMA, but I feel there's a need for both and there's no such thing as "bitcoin is only technology and economics" Without people (men and women, both doing best what they can do best) there is no bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-11-24 21:47:46

That means it is held/lost somewhere in the US. Have you contacted USPS?
@_date: 2015-03-17 01:34:41
The best way to backup digital money is paper :)
My recommendation:
1. setup Trezor + add passphrase 
2. store the 24-word seed generated by Trezor to a safe or several places 
3. remember well your passphrase (or share it with someone who you can totally trust or who has no idea where the seed is)
Even if Trezor or SatoshiLabs go out of business, you are OK if you import your seed to some wallet that can work with the seed.
@_date: 2015-11-25 14:05:53
Exactly... I'd really like to know what's their official explanation
@_date: 2016-05-18 12:19:18
If you don't believe in Bitcoin, buy at least one!
That's my standard response to this question.
@_date: 2016-05-31 22:20:28
Yes, just a slight change - sharing the PIN is not necessary. The device can be wiped (or get a new one) and do the recovery.
However if uses a passphrase for TREZOR, he should consider sharing that too. 
@_date: 2016-05-10 08:20:45
Definitely, this would eliminate the risk of someone key-logging the master password and effectively gaining access to all passwords.
@_date: 2016-10-15 12:09:00
Hi, this blog post by Trezor may answer your questions
@_date: 2015-03-17 01:46:42
Basics of TREZOR security are:
1. use a good PIN (not 1234 or your birthdate :)
2. add passphrase to your seed that you do not write to your Recovery seed paper, do not tell anyone and do not forget.
This will help protect your seed when someone steals it from you.
I have to warn you though: If you forget the passphrase, there is by design no way to recover it. So just make sure it's something you don't forget or you can recall.
3. never make digital copies of the seed (camera, phone, scan etc..)
@_date: 2015-03-17 01:37:49
and consider adding a passphrase, that will strengthen protection of your seed if stolen.
@_date: 2015-03-12 20:04:22

@_date: 2015-02-18 18:16:00
I never said that history is irrelevant and maybe it's not necessary to draw such hyperbola you did. What I was trying to say that we should learn from past mistakes.
The bank hack is no financial crisis situation that would require a bailout. It is simply a security issue.
As former executive of insurance companies I doubt very much that any kind of insurance would cover theft of deposits due to hack of internal systems of the bank. There is a common insurance for unauthorized withdrawals/payments misusing the customers card up to a certain limit. 
There's also some data-protection/IT insurance but I'm not sure how this case would classify.
TLDR, insurance is very costly and the cost is transmitted to the client.
The same way the monstrous bank security departments and server houses cost millions and sometimes fail big times.
TREZOR Login could not save the 1 billion bank hack but it's definitely a good first step to prevent this: 
@_date: 2015-03-13 09:10:17
Not a reason but maybe an extra motivation:
We will do a special promotion to celebrate mycelium&amp;trezor and drop some percentage of that sales to your developers.. or anyone you point your finger to.. :)  
@_date: 2015-02-18 22:51:27
Depending on whether he assumes or knows, an attacker might go away with some smaller amounts or not. 
If you are loaded with bitcoins, get more trezors or other safe ways to store them and don't talk too much about it. The same principle of risk prevention as for fiat money I guess.

Yes, Czech republic has the most historical monuments per square kilometer. 12 UNESCO heritage places in this small country.

Of course thanks :)
creating multiple wallets with one seed is a great feature.
@_date: 2015-10-27 11:35:37
Why would you suggest to create paper wallets if he already has a TREZOR - with a paper wallet backup basically (recovery seed), but much easier / safer to actually spend..? 
@_date: 2015-02-18 19:14:13
I understood that you are talking about a bailout/insurance in case of bad market conditions (depression). 
Not sure if exchanges are eager to co-finance each other's losses from security breaches. That would only extend the damage of one hacked exchange to others.
If insurance companies had to insure bitcoin exchanges, then the exchanges would have to meet standardized criteria for security. It will make their operation much more expensive and yet not bulletproof. The hackers are smart people and I doubt a bit that any standards would prevent them from their activities.
In any young business many startups will fail for various reasons. It is a big shame though that people are losing their holdings while Bitcoin is a very secure tool. 
It's up to the remaining bitcoin businesses to think about solving two issues that can be solved already:
1. avoiding to touch user's private keys
2. avoiding the misuse/theft of user credentials

There's one real life risk left when using TREZOR with a compromised computer - phishing = changing the btc addresses that are SENDING btc to. 
We try to educate our users to be careful and verify via other channels, especially for larger sums. 
This risk is inherent for all wallets/platforms and can be partially mitigated by implementing the payment protocol BIP070.
As protection against phishing on your RECEIVING addresses, Trezor has the "Show on TREZOR", an 'eye' icon that triggers display of the address on your TREZOR display. If it's the same as on the computer screen, you can be sure no phishing going on.
  
Otherwise, Trezor protect against keylogging PIN + the entire private key generation and transaction signing happens separately from the compromised environment.
 
@_date: 2015-02-07 09:26:27
Because when you protect your seed with additional passphrase, thieves can't get on your bitcoins even if they have your seed or your Trezor.

We will post some how-to with screenshots for TREZOR + GA in our User manual soon
Meanwhile a short guide:
* Connect your TREZOR to the computer, go to greenaddress.it.
* Click the orange CREATE WALLET on mainpage of GA 
* Confirm Use webwallet on the following screen.
STEP 1 of Setup
* When TREZOR plugged in, the next window says "Use TREZOR to create a GreenAddress wallet" 
You will be asked to confirm on your TREZOR device.
STEP2 of Setup
* Set up 2FA
Choose email, sms, Google auth or phone.
Activate by entering security code delivered to the chosen channel.
STEP3 of Setup
* press the green button Take me to my wallet
Now you have created a new Trezor + GA wallet. 
Note that you still have your Trezor accounts created under mytrezor.com on your device, you just can't see them in GA.
If you have initialized TREZOR via myTrezor.com with a PIN, GA will ask for it. 
You can create additional passphrase to the new seed. 
RECEIVING BITCOINS
* click the blue button Show URI and addresses to create a new address where you can send some btc to...
SENDING BITCOINS
* enter address, amount
* click Send
* confirm on your TREZOR device 
* enter second factor authentication code (that arrives to your email or phone, depending on your chosen method)

Greenaddress that also works with Trezor
@_date: 2015-02-06 02:54:29
There are many downloads of btc wallets, many searches for "bitcoin" and many cool startups for such a small country.
But Czech Rep is still very far from the adoption level, investments and interest as we see in the US. 
@_date: 2015-02-06 02:59:58
If you have a TREZOR, you can generate the seed securely away from the computer (the words only display on the device). Like this you don't have to enter your seed via your computer and potentially compromise it.
Then just use your Trezor with Greenaddress or Greenbits.
I also love the Trezor login to Greenaddress - no passwords, no usernames. Very cool.
@_date: 2015-02-18 21:53:05
I really think we shouldn't compare economic depression of a country with security issues of some companies/business.
@_date: 2016-07-11 17:16:33
When you swipe your paper wallet, the bitcoins are transferred to the new seed / new private keys (of the wallet you use for swiping). I'm not aware of any perfectly secure way to swipe the paper wallet though.
I can only recommend you transfer your coins to a Trezor and keep the recovery seed of it safe. From your Trezor, you can always send small amounts to your mobile or online (hot) wallet.
@_date: 2015-02-12 16:46:16
yes. myTrezor.com, the online wallet for Trezor users.
It requires no usernames, email address or passwords.
Available on each online computer.
The private keys always stay in Trezor, so the only thing myTrezor.com does is showing you your balance and sending transactions signed inside Trezor to the blockchain. 
There's nothing that hackers or fraudalent operators could steal from you.
If myTrezor.com is down for any reasons, you can use other Trezor compatible wallets, for example MultiBit or Greenaddress.it which is also an online wallet.
edit: having encrypted wallet backup online is not very recommended. You have to type in your password to decrypt, in the very moment a keylogger can be listening.. Or someone might just crack your password. Old good paper in a safe place (or more safe places) is what I'd recommend. 
@_date: 2016-07-11 17:17:46
and here's how Trezor handles change addresses, it's a bit technical explanation: 
@_date: 2015-02-18 11:06:41
This is totally irrelevant, expensive, heavy-processing and not even sufficient (just look at the recent 1 billion bank hack). Also, all this insurance is paid by the end customers.
I'd suggest to the exchanges and wallets to implement a login by Trezor. Such exchange won't be having trouble to protect login credentials, their users will surely get a fair discount on Trezor and thats it. 
This is a simple HOW-TO
 
@_date: 2015-02-06 17:26:24
wow, thank you. 
I don't know a few of those resources, so I'll go through it next week after our weekend crypto-hackaton is over :)
@_date: 2016-07-13 18:21:42
We will need a few more months to deliver Trezor 2 to our shop. (no more precise ETA is available now), in the meantime you can sleep tight :)
@_date: 2016-07-01 18:48:56
The browser can't extract the private keys from your Trezor, that's the basic parameter of Trezor - that you can actually use it on any computer, with any settings and any viruses installed.
Offline mode is an advantage, not the sole purpose of the Chrome Extension. 
@_date: 2013-09-04 05:16:25
i know it might be too late now but maybe for future you might consider getting a TREZOR. 
Getting a computer stolen, broken or lost (even together with trezor) - no harm done, except you need to get a new computer and a new trezor. With the hardware wallet you can recover everything (i mean the wallet balance AND the entire transaction history) in a secure way.
@_date: 2015-02-08 07:12:14
It's wise to have a (ideally hand-written) copy of the seed in at least two SAFE places. Many redditors have posted their suggestions on protecting/distributinf seed.
The worst thing you can do is making a digital copy OR storing the seed in your drawer next to the Trezor.
@_date: 2016-07-18 19:30:29
sure, I have a separate "savings" account in my Trezor :)
@_date: 2013-06-28 06:14:22
hoarding is fine but not in the early stages of the economy. it freezes the development of bitcoin. what you are talking about is valid for a well developed fiat money economy. 
the question whether savings or investments are the source of wealth, i would say reasonably both. with saving only you will have the japanese scenario, with spending over the top you'll get the us debt.. but again, we are talking about bitcoin, a baby which needs to be firstly understood and adopted by as many as possible (and not hoarded by few)
@_date: 2013-09-12 17:58:31
I confirm, TREZOR will be using BIP32.

The second part with questions from the audience was as well really interesting. I'm sorry to see it cut from the video.

Hi, I'd like to react with another question:
Why would I commit to invest 1BTC into security of another XY BTC Im having providing the value of my balance is rising and potential loss will hurt even more in the future?
@_date: 2015-02-03 13:36:42
* I’ve noticed that was different between Ledger and TREZOR is that TREZOR requires a “private or trusted computer”.
I believe there's a mistake. It probably should say Ledger requires a private or trusted computer...
@_date: 2013-11-21 17:56:02
TREZOR enables to set additional encryption passphrase which is doing exactly what you propose. If entered incorrectly, nothing is displayed.
@_date: 2013-06-28 16:02:42
hmm you're probably right. but then, you might have to identify your transactions to the authorities within the blockchain.
isnt this a way how to put the users under control, link following transactions etc.. ? 
@_date: 2013-11-14 21:22:08
You're probably right, thanks. With some features we had difficulties to determine if to put "n/a" or "no".. 
@_date: 2013-09-12 19:20:57
Im working with slush and stick on the TREZOR project.

This is quite a good way and almost sufficient to calculate hardware components costs. Anybody who thinks to develop such a device should not forget to add overheads / costs like assembling the parts, packaging, shipping, wallet infrastructure and support, some little marketing like website or graphic design. Plus pay to the developers eventually and maybe a place to meet or some IT infrastructure. Did I mention the nice part - taxes?  8-) 
@_date: 2013-09-13 07:25:21
sure it is open-source

You actually must have a wallet on your computer, I recommend to everybody to read 
How does TREZOR work?
    1. You connect the device into the USB and run your wallet software.
    2. The device is automatically recognized (by matching VendorID and ProductID on the USB bus).
    3. Once the wallet software asks for the master public key, it will show your addresses and their balances.
    4. When you want to send some coins, your wallet software creates a template of the transaction and sends it to TREZOR.
    5. TREZOR displays a transaction summary on its display and asks you to confirm the transaction by pressing the confirmation button.
    6. TREZOR signs the transaction using a private key stored in the device and sends a signed transaction to the desktop software.
    7. The desktop software then sends the signed transaction to the Bitcoin network.

Hello, it's indeed a great idea to have something to walk with and pay on the go BUT no wireless is safe enough + mobile phones and PCs have tons of proprietary parts which are not auditable and can be full of backdoors. 
@_date: 2013-06-27 11:14:16
although this is partly a good news, im not so much excited. this regulation is promoting hoarding and speculations instead of the real bitcoin economy. they know what they're doing. far better supporting a commodity than having a competition in  a vital currency which is out of the control of the central banks. money should circulate. call me a fool...
@_date: 2013-11-21 02:17:49
good luck! Can I get one please :)
@_date: 2013-11-21 02:14:13
Armory is great but not easy to use for a regular user. TREZOR aims at people with average computer skills.
TREZOR is an offline computer with great usability. You still need an online computer to transmit the signed transaction to the network, but thanks to TREZOR its safe. 
@_date: 2013-12-31 09:26:06
Hi good to start with. From my perspective what is needed a lot is more info about security threats and prevention. Thats where many newbies go unhappy.
@_date: 2013-11-11 07:46:19
How about this:
1. Get a trezor
2. Set it up (click through the setup wizard)
3. Done. Use it.

The keylogger protection is one of our inventions. We have a way of PIN entering that does not reveal the digits.
TREZOR counts the time only when plugged..

hello everybody, i'm trying to respond to all emails but recently it's been impossible to do it immediately. please be patient. I replied to JChief now.
just a general comment on what was said below:
We are paying a big portion of our production in bitcoins, so there is no speculation in our "no return policy" whatsoever. Most of the btc we raise in this crowdfunding we use for the production and development straight away.
