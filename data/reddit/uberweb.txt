Haha, Hodl by design huh?
It's a feature not a bug.

Sell options and then dump btc. Pretty much what the wallst guys are gonna try. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 16:22:03
I don't think it was luck, they should be smart guys (given harvard) that have/had good ideas and had enough balls to pursue risks and balance rewards.
@_date: 2017-12-04 22:57:16
7% that ensures the principle doesn’t go to 0 is still good. 
No one knows where bitcoin or crypto will go tomm which is why folks aren’t not rushing to put their 401k’s into it.

Can't do a hostile takeover; whinyberg owns 57% of the company/voting rights.

People fear what they don’t understand and/or can’t control.

Yeah, an easy way to point volatility and the 102 bitcoin would be to say sell a large amount of google stock on NASDAQ for 1$ and the price of the stock will be 1$ for that brief period (milli second/whatever) .
Someone goofed up their trade and lost a lot of money. doesn't mean the underlying asset is volatile. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 17:08:10
You fail to mention the upside for me in this transaction :)
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:42:10
Haha, amen to that though the whales definitely can move the market to their pleasing. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:04:31
Thanks, will check them out, do they allow funding through bank accounts, or do i need to buy via gdax/coinbase and then transfer btc/eth for trading?
@_date: 2017-11-14 15:23:59
coins or $ amount?
@_date: 2017-11-21 19:53:00
Is there a tech paper that I can read on how the LN works?
Also; would net neutrality impact any of this? 
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:21:02
Relax guys, i just sold some; it'll go up shortly.
You're welcome!

There are folks/investors out here with a bitcoin portfolio in the 100's and there are folks here with millions.. how much they buy/sell at once is very very relative to their portfolio.
You can check out some live orders at any of the exchanges to see volume.
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:00:06
What exchange are you using?
@_date: 2017-11-14 01:29:13
I suppose. Though the uncertainty is bugging, not knowing which horse to bet on :)
Plus the transaction fees on BTC have been absurd, just wanted to transfer from an online wallet to my hardware wallet and it was showing 17$ to transfer a little money. crazy.
No matter the solution, hope this gets resolved.
@_date: 2017-11-27 16:24:44
Markets are very predictable imo. 
I sell, it rises; I buy, it falls. 
If only i could capitalize on this surety. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:14:10
700-7000 in &lt;300 days, i think 5-10 might be lesser volatility :)
@_date: 2017-11-07 16:02:52
I think fool does this, but they need to list the authors personal financial stake in all these predictions. 
If an asset is going to move ~50% in 1 year and the 'analyst' confident in their research, you should expect a large portion of their portfolio in the asset.
Most of these analyst are using outdated models for analysis that don't really apply to modern stock markets (so much readily available news, social media and mob mentality); let alone crypto. 
Take all of these with a large grain of salt. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 15:30:49
It does, look at the daily moving average and transaction volume. 
Depending on the exchange, 30 million can move things a lot and factor in mob mentality when experiencing sharp movements and you have an avalanche..
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:43:38
Goes both ways, if you employed your second strategy and bitcoin jumped to 10k, you'd be kicking yourself for not investing it all..
@_date: 2017-11-10 15:58:02
What currency? BTC's never touched 8k in USD.
Good luck and hodl.
@_date: 2017-11-17 07:31:51
Yeah, but 10 years from now we can agree that crypto going to be the future, but which coin is holding the light?
What if some new coin, started from scratch that has govt/irs/worldwide backing with similar/better features comes along.. etc etc..
Either way, to the moon and Hodl.
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:54:57
The government can enforce any fiat to crypto transaction (which requires a bank or a exchange) to be regulated. They can have it fully monitored (to ensure taxes etc) as needed while not being able to control the crypto, they can heavily regulate the backend.
Unless all trade suddenly occurs in crypto, they still have a lot of say.
@_date: 2017-11-22 02:08:15
I dunno man, have you seen some new videos, seems like very shaky as if he's being threatened or something..
With the amount of money at stake, can't rule it out.
We are talking about money that men have fought wars over.
@_date: 2017-11-17 07:22:25
He never sold though. His coins are still on the exchange right?
@_date: 2017-11-07 15:59:57
A guaranteed way to make money with bitcoin is to just look at what i am doing; and do the exact opposite.
@_date: 2017-11-14 01:32:16
Best way to look at it; either make your own informed (if thats even possible with the amount of social manipulation on either sides); or bet equally on both sides.
@_date: 2017-11-11 15:50:54
 The problem with modern investing is ‘mob mentality’. It’s no longer enough for the fundamentals to be solid or you to ‘believe in it’, you need rest of the ‘mob’ to do the same and there lies the problem. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:42:25
Hodl? 
@_date: 2017-11-14 15:28:36
Good luck :)
May all coins win!
@_date: 2017-11-04 18:45:36
But he's not putting his money where his mouth is right. He said he'll not invest in bitcoin, and I can't find any article to suggest that he has. His new company is coming out with another coin which he said he's interested in buying.
Either way, good advise, 10% is a decent sum to put in speculative/high risk 'investments'..
@_date: 2018-11-06 15:03:26
Didn’t they classify it as a commodity earlier? If so, isn’t it merely a vending machine and shouldn’t require authorization for an ATM?
@_date: 2017-10-16 07:43:00
A program that tries all combinations of shifts will take a few to write and even lesser to run. Don't use caesar ciphers for anything but a love note.
@_date: 2017-10-19 21:43:56
What about buying commodities with said money?

Draw the parallel of snail mail and email and fiat currency and bitcoins.
Explain a bit of cryptography cause thats the key behind bitcoins. You can explain public and private key by giving a ( ELIF )simple example.
You can create your own method using a prime number square key-pair technique. Use that as an example to show how public keys can be derived from private keys and not vice versa
Here's how I would try, imagine a prime number as your secret private key (lets say 7919), the public key is mathematically related, in our example, its the square, so our public key is 62710561. Give them the public key. If it weren't for computers it would take a long time to get the private key from the public key. But very simple to see if 7919 is the private key for the public number. Anyone can send the money to 62710561, but only the person having knowledge of 7919 can spend it.
Do talk about how currency works in general, drawbacks of the current system and advantages bitcoins presents over it.
Don't forget to list the disadvantages of bitcoin too.

The places you exchange USD for GBP (all forex companies) will send out a friendly year end note to IRS. Additionally if you file taxes in US you need to report all offshore holdings on a form. 
My question was everything else has a verifiable paper trail, except bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-11-14 00:45:07
Seriously, thats really good business practice and a graceful exit. Gotta appreciate business owners like that.
@_date: 2013-11-19 12:38:29
Also, bitcoin volumes will be higher if people are moving their own bitcoins from one address to another.
@_date: 2013-11-26 03:28:01
I like your answer. Mums the word!
@_date: 2013-11-28 15:05:34
Excellent tax breaks?
@_date: 2013-11-26 03:27:47
Even when i convert BTC to USD , who is keeping track of what is investment gain or what my friend sent from overseas.
@_date: 2013-11-26 04:14:26
With foreign exchanges, there's no risk though right.
Convert X USD's from a legitimate company (say coinbase), transfer to any of the random exchanges, do your day trading thing and become a millionaire. Transfer X USD back to the legitimate company and show no gain no loss. 
@_date: 2013-11-26 04:18:22
Yeah i agree that this would probably be the right way to do it. Just treat bitcoin as any other underlying asset. 
I for one am waiting for the bitcoin ETF.
@_date: 2013-11-26 03:26:48
I know you have to, same with losses, straight dedication from federal taxable income. The question is whats stopping every one in the US claiming a bitcoin loss during tax time. How can anyone verify it (as bitcoin addresses aren't associated with anyone per-se)
For example, person A's taxable income is 100k, he buys 100K USD worth of bitcoins, sends to trading platform and resends to random addresses and claims as a loss, or buys mining equipment from cex and deducts operational expenses for businesses. 0 tax liability. I know i must be missing something..
@_date: 2013-11-24 04:54:53
it does, you need to select the checkbox 'collect shipping info' while creating your buttons. That way it'll take the shipping info.
Its under the advanced options. Good luck to your mom.
@_date: 2013-11-28 15:08:07
I believe everything. 
Except maybe that a jeweler sold gold at 3/4th it's cost. Doesn't make sense. Margins are so low on bars. 
@_date: 2013-11-23 14:02:27
block chain itself is safe and run by a well known trustworthy person, however the private keys are 'calculated' on your browser. So any browser exploit or key loggers/other viruses might be able to steal your keys and your coins. That being said, I have half my bitcoins on that.
@_date: 2013-11-26 04:25:14
Will try not to :)
@_date: 2013-11-28 14:33:04
As it stands now, crypto currencies don't provide consumer protection. The same story can be written about some guy using bitcoins to pay a software developer who never delivered a product. With credit cards I at least have the peace of mind that I can reverse a payment if someone stiffs me. 
People argue that these same protection (escrow etc) can be built over the bitcoin protocol. Won't these escrow providers have the same problems/issues as paypal/visa etc. And their charges plus bitcoin transaction fees will be similar to what visa or square:paypal charge. 
Don't get me wrong. I'm a long time
Supporter of bitcoin and love the technical aspect of this. I just find it hard (at this point)to convince regular folks why they should use bitcoins over cash/credit/debit cards.
