For spanish speakers: solicitud de suspensión de pagos.

WTF, miners stopping their rigs until value goes up again?

Free movement of capital does not involve those measures that a bank may take in order to stay solvent, that is, measures to avoid an uncontrollable outflow of deposits. Putting a limit on withdraws is, therefore, not against the free movement of capital as long as it is properly justified.
"Member States may introduce restrictions on capital movement, including capital controls, in certain circumstances under strict conditions on grounds of public policy or public security".
Two undetermined legal concepts, the mother of legal uncertainty.

Interest-free banks aren't just a 2010's fad. They have existed for almost 50 years and their biggest achievement was constructing a parallel financial system with its own "currency" ( the so-called local currency).
The governments of the countries in which those banks were operating banned the use of their currencies and doomed their system to be always depending on regular currency and therefore unviable (the inflation made the people giving loans lose purchasing power).
Given the fact that it is almost impossible to ban the use of cryptocurrencies in a country, Bitcoin will be a threat to traditional banks as soon as it achieves vertical integration in a community.
That is why I am asking.
[For more info about ethical banking and their own currencies google JAK Members Bank and read about their ban from Denmark].

You're right.
- International transfers were the mean by which Cyprus banks were threatened of losing their deposits and therefore their funds.
The chain of events could be described as:
Contract Deposit- BANK RUN - Cancel Deposit - Wire the Money out of Cyprus - This * thousands of clients - Bank files for bankruptcy.
- Undefined legal concepts are dangerous when they are waived/interpreted by the wrong people.

How long does it take for the deposit to arrive? I order it 10 minutes ago and the ponzi balance remains the same (0.000)

Not in my case. I typed verso wallet and got no matches...

The laws of the US don't apply universally... As a matter of fact, the Japanese legal system belongs to the Civil category and is highly influenced by German law.

Any ideas for the presentation?
@_date: 2014-02-16 15:11:08
It's a complete demo:
- Buy / Sell Bitcoins in Kraken. (We were going to use Mt.Gox).
- Purchase goods in a webpage (no porn involved here).
- Transfer between wallets.
