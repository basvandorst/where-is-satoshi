Thanks for that readout. Still have a few questions though


Doesn't my example still scale down? 
- All BTC are in circulation, no more are being produced. 
- You have 21 million people on earth, 21 million BTC
- Half the people own all of the economies wealth. 10.5 million have 2BTC each
- Half the people (10.5 million) lend their networth to live off interest at an arbitrary 10% to the other 10.5 million
- How is that principle amount of 21 million BTC going to be paid back plus 2.1 million BTC? 


I understand this part, but in my example, it's a Bitcoin only world. Other sources of value in this example would act as a form of inflation, no?


Isn't the difference is that we print fiat out of thin air to lend, and to collect interest where-as we cannot do the same with BTC? 


Isn't this how most of the world is currently living? Having a negative net worth and in debt is basically having no money
I guess the point I'm making is that it if BTC cannot inflate, we would need to rely on different currencies or sources of value outside of BTC to accommodate that. If our financial system is broken, how could BTC potentially replace it? Finance is obviously not my area and I'm sure I'm way off, i'm just trying to understand

Exactly the feedback I wanted. But, what's the 15th?
@_date: 2014-03-22 00:53:29
I hear ya, but you said.. 


I just don't think that would destroy it, nor would they go that route since it may work against them. My post is suggesting a scenario where they may _make_ the system fail themselves vs trying convince people not to use it by law.

Also, how is the $ figure calculated? If it's the MSRP of common ASIC vendors cost vs hash rate, I'm sure Intel could cut the government a deal at a much, much better rate. Intel could produce a superior product and in the mass scale of demand it would be pretty damn cheap IMHO. 
@_date: 2014-03-31 23:58:14
I see this a lot and totally agree with it. I can afford to lose it I just don't want to. I guess it's all relative, loosing 11 grand will not affect my life style, but it will make me wish I put it something else. Maybe also curl up in the bathroom and have a good cry

Mirror: 
This is good because we can now start a conversation on how to properly use bitcoin. Investors now feel safe. IRS should have allowed the bitcoin community to have a word before making a stance. It's a burden on bitcoin users who use it as currency as it makes tax filing very difficult and audits can be even more difficult an expensive. 
@_date: 2014-10-02 00:59:58
I know enough about myself outside of Bitcoin that I won't reach that point! I don't judge, and I don't push my views on anyone. I think that basic advice (to me) translates to anything; religion, politics, woman's rights, financial advice, what type of girls are attractive, what art is the best, best music genre, "potato" or "potato", etc... 
@_date: 2014-03-20 15:55:44
I have this playing in a different tab. It sounds like a cute little 5 year old genius talking about bitcoin and finances. 
@_date: 2014-04-16 17:47:17
Already answered, but for me the "ah ha!" moment was simply realizing any "wallet" in any form (software, web, online, offline, hot, cold, etc) is both the private and public key - or a means of combining the too. The private key is simply a key to access/control any coins that were sent to the public address. 
I just created a wallet using a vanitygen tool. 


Privkey: 5JT95kKm9yBuBxUie92M4ma1JeTbN5EcQ1dT9mwLLmVSEhYwVmK 
I could have printed this out and have been done with it, and deleted any trace of the key. It's now a paper wallet. I could have imported this key to a software wallet like Armory, it's now a software wallet. 
Do take note about security though. You want to make sure no one has access to that private key. There are ways (already mentioned) that can secure that key with a pass-phrase (BIP38). I personally used bitaddress.org

Source? I figured he was wealthy but thought if he agreed to this, it would be something he should not come out of pocket. 
@_date: 2014-02-28 02:06:07


Yep. I'm confident in BitCoin's future and don't plan on gambling with swings or anything, but it's nice knowing I have the option to quickly act if the need arises


Thanks, I corrected that bullet point
Appreciate the feedback! Sounds like I'm not too far off so far
@_date: 2014-02-28 02:21:17
Understood. I like the benefits of having a hot wallet and want to minimize the risks that come with them. And no, it's not a trivial amount to me. 
I figure this laptop could only be stolen/compromised from me while it is on for me to be at risk of losing the coins. Hard drive encryption helps address the concern if it's stolen while it is off, alternate OS with strong password protection helps with address it being compromised while on (and for a very short period of time). 
@_date: 2014-03-31 23:41:29
Thanks for the reply, but this response is why I posted this. What gives you this 4-5k figure? 
@_date: 2014-08-29 18:31:02
I looked around, a few on the bitcointalk forums claim he used Tor as well. I would put money on that he did. He also used anonymized email. 
@_date: 2014-03-31 23:40:19
You're probably kidding, but that's how I think. "What's 3% on 10 grand!?"

I'm all in. 
@_date: 2014-02-28 02:12:14


I specifically mentioned Chase because I heard some bad story's. I was thinking about opening another bank account just to use for this. It's not illegal or anything but it just seems suspicious/sketchy to be transferring a decent amount of funds to multiple accounts and then buying BTC with it. I don't want to raise red flags or be on any lists. Then again I don't want to lose my Chase account. I will need to read more about it


I was thinking about this, and storing in a safety deposit box. I was just thinking, what if I want to unload all my BTC at 3am? I would fire-up my laptop and have that option. 
@_date: 2014-04-01 01:16:19
I bought at 750, 700, 600, and 550. My purchase at ~450 will be my last though, and most substantial. 
@_date: 2014-03-22 00:41:20
How would they make the bitcoin _protocol_ illegal? They make it illegal and people would deal exclusively in BTC, no exchanges. That's my thought anyway, I could be way off 
@_date: 2014-02-28 02:45:11


Although what you said is unlikely (and I could put additional controls in place to minimize it further), loosing _everything_ in the event it does happen drives your point. Also putting those additional controls in place may be more of a pain in the ass then driving to the bank to access a deposit box. Thanks for the reply and I'll think about more cold storage options.

OP Here. I don't assume he was in the US. The scenario I gave would potentially work _if_ he were in the US. The methods I outlined would apply to the US legal system.

Can you ELI5 what an Multi Sig address is
@_date: 2014-03-22 00:37:27


Would that really destroy it? You can regulate the part of the exchange or transfer to a different currency, but how do you regulate or "ban" bitcoin itself? If it gains mass adoption as I was saying, maybe people would only rely solely on BTC.  I think then it would call for extreme measures. 
@_date: 2014-04-05 16:31:49
I wonder how many DVR's it would take to mine 1BTC, and how long it would take. I would guess several thousand and months
@_date: 2014-03-28 03:16:16
How does this have more upvotes than downvotes? Genuinely curious
@_date: 2014-04-01 01:03:06
I'm 30, single, no kids, no debt except mortgage. Net worth around 70k outside BTC. Disposable income of 1-2k a month. Maybe you thought I was younger but those investment don't interest me. My life expectancy is another 30-40 years based on family history. I'm not investing to realize my gain when I'm planning end of life
@_date: 2014-03-08 19:34:41
He's a gold bug because he doesn't agree with printing money, inflation, and governments manipulating currencies, no? I would venture a guess and say he'd be a proponent of Bitcoin if he fully understood the technology/science behind it. 
@_date: 2014-07-01 01:44:50
Your daughter is 17 and is a wild child. She wants money for the movies. You don't believe her. You transfer some BTC to the MultiSig Cinema wallet. Your daughter and the movie theater sign the key for payment - both are needed. Now little Cindy can't buy cocaine, good on you Dad!
@_date: 2014-04-21 18:35:00
They're talking about voice/data service. You don't need to sign up to their service and can just use Wifi on the device
@_date: 2014-08-29 15:38:07
Yeah, what I described is common knowledge for tracking down anyone. But did the FBI _really_ try this? Is this on their radar? You could easily speculate that it is for several reasons, but I don't think we know for sure that this is a venue they tried perusing.

I have been buying around 600, and 500. I'm making my final purchase early next week at whatever price it is and then I'm done or a while. Send it to a paper wallet, put it in safe deposit box and relax. I don't know how in the world first, and very early adopters handled the swings early on and held.

I can set you up with an [opencart]( site with a coinbase plug-in. PM me if you're interested
@_date: 2014-08-29 16:53:12
Personally I think the Bitcoin ecosystem could be hurt by revealing who this person or group is. I also respect his privacy. I just see journalist looking up who is named "Satoshi Nakamoto" and flying to China to find him, or speculation on other cyrpto guys. I have not seen a digital way anyone has tried to pursue him. Also, what I have posted is pretty standard, I'm not telling anyone what they don't already know.

Unrealized swings. Realized gains. I have been lucky due to necessity of needing to sell. I have an average cost basis of ~480 of 30 BTC and sold 15 of those at ~595. I have 15 left at current price.

You don't know who I am, coinbase does.

I did not cover that, which is certainly possible. How do you know he used Tor? 
@_date: 2014-03-22 00:44:28
I understand you're not debating a point and just giving a figure, but to add to that... 


...Just to put things in perspective if the US economy and/or USD was at risk 
@_date: 2014-03-08 21:21:42
I agree, I wish it were public as well. But it being private allows a real, personal exchange of idea's and information. It would be more political if it were public. Being private allows them to ask genuine questions without looking ignorant, and learn from each other.  
@_date: 2014-09-07 02:33:26
No response yet. I think this raises a bunch of questions
- Is a 3rd party asking for this, and they are complying?
- Either way, if we use coinbase are going to need to justify and explain our transactions to use their services?
-  "We are required to periodically review high volume accounts as part of being a Money Service Business." What does this even mean? Is a "Money Service Business" a US thing/law that needs to comply with certain regulations? If so, what are they? 
I'm all for Coinbase being legit, but knowing all the details will make me a happy customer. I don't want to get these emails and need to wonder what's going on. 
Edit: compiling does not mean complying
@_date: 2014-09-26 18:31:59
Yeah that's what I think as well. I think Bitcoin would need to rely on another store of value when it comes to loans
@_date: 2014-04-26 01:59:59
- How much will it cost to host a site? 
- Is there a profit for the person running the site? 
- Will all transactions be in Bitcoin? 
- Any personal information required? 
- I see you ask for location, is any territory off limits (e.g. US)? 
I have a local cash game with ~20-40 people who play off and on. I could see that network growing with something like this.
@_date: 2014-04-09 22:15:19
I think decentralized digital currency will be relevant in 10+ years. I don't think we can say for sure Bitcoin will be though, but that's just my opinion. I think with anything digital there is a ton of innovation and things move quick. I think Bitcoin is the first and has the most adoption, so it has that going for it. 
EDIT: I also want it to prevail by the way
