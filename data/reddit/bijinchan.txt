As long as you don't get into the business of raiding people that manufacture LSD, that's bad.

Wouldn't trust anything coming out of a pig's mouth.

Any way to find out what those addresses are? The ones made to receive change that is.

I just came across this thread and was interesting in listing some pictures on CoinDL. Have you sold anything yet?
@_date: 2013-12-17 06:42:06
Hai. Okei desu.

You seem to be implying there's something bad about buying and selling drugs.

I also received 3 similar emails this morning. Turns out they were just old transactions that I had done, but for some reason Coinbase sent out emails about them. I was excited for like 5 minutes before I figured out what happened.

Which marketplace are you getting your sex and rock n roll from?

Yeah but if I can't smack my children around who will build the roads?

Wow, been years since I was on DDO. Wonder if they still have that annoying community of high school kids that think they're the smartest thing around. There was so much drama on that website.

Unfortunately it looks like Bittit is too unorganized and lacking in decent photographs for reasonable prices.
