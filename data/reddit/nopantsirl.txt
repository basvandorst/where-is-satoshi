Those cases don't represent how normal people act, and they got thrown out.
People have been struck by lightning multiple times, but I'm not cowering in fear every time I hear thunder.  This guy doesn't need to give anyone any silver.  He is more likely to get hit by a car while filming his bit than he is to get sued.

Why would gold be confiscated?  Nobody cares about gold.  Nobody trades gold for goods or services.  There isn't a gold shortage that would affect a vital industry.
@_date: 2015-07-09 07:16:45
Lol, lawyers cost more than $150.
@_date: 2015-07-09 07:27:04
So... you expect a class action lawsuit?  That's absurd.  When some smug looking guy with a cameraman doesn't follow through on giving you some silver he just offered you, you call him a douche and walk away.

If things get bad enough that US dollars aren't worth anything and people start using whatever they think is worth something as currency, why would anyone want silver?  Why wouldn't you stockpile antibiotics, alcohol, seeds, bullets, and other things that actually have value?
Also, there isn't a real silver shortage.  There is enough silver for the industries that use it.  It's just that there are people who like to bury it in their back yard, and governments who like to tie it up in currency.

Yes, and we all carry guns and ride rascal scooters.  Do you have any idea what it takes to sue someone?  Even small claims court is more than $150 worth of hassle.  The $12k class action suit would get you laughed out of any lawyers office.
This guy didn't give out any silver.  This video is heavily edited.  You are watching the narrative he wants you to watch.  It's just like reality TV.

Gold makes a lot of sense as a currency.  It's easily malleable (can stamp your current monarch's face in to it), it doesn't corrode, and there's enough of it (but not too much).  All this is kind of moot in the modern era.
@_date: 2013-11-27 04:37:04
There is 0% chance this is legit.
@_date: 2013-12-12 02:45:45
None of them are good ones.  Would you believe a site offering free USD?  If it is actually giving away free money, it probably isn't worth the time investment (pennies for minutes).
@_date: 2013-11-27 04:02:02
Is it?  How are you measuring that?  So far it seems like the optimists are more accurate.
@_date: 2013-12-12 20:30:29
This doesn't make any sense and sounds like a scam.
@_date: 2013-12-02 09:21:17
They are very excited by it.  Like you said, there are quite a few articles about bitcoin on the front page.  If bitcoin succeeds (as most people here think it will), they'll come around.
@_date: 2013-12-04 02:37:30
Maybe their parents live in China.
@_date: 2013-11-28 01:46:43
bitfinex lets you do that
@_date: 2013-12-03 03:00:38
pic was too tiny, bought litecoins
@_date: 2013-11-26 19:28:35
Unlimited time?  Mine bitcoins by hand.
@_date: 2013-11-26 17:57:55
I could pull my car with a horse and fax you my tweets.

If it's worth a financial toll on the system, why don't we just create busywork for everyone?  That way we can all "work" and get paid.
Making a system more efficient benefits everyone, even if a few people's jobs become obsolete.  That's why we build cars with robots now.
@_date: 2013-12-09 21:39:16
where do you think you are, bitcoinmarkets?
@_date: 2013-11-28 01:43:24
buying on margin is a real thing
@_date: 2013-12-02 01:01:48
That's a lot of info to glean from a pretty common misspelling.
@_date: 2013-12-01 09:19:11
Jesus, how many of his BTC did he spend on coke?
@_date: 2013-11-28 02:02:34
Don't.  Answer questions.  If they say you should sell now before they're worth nothing, point out that they can put their money where their mouth is by selling on margin, but you've done your own research and are happy with your positions.
@_date: 2013-12-04 01:10:23
Fairness is a weird concept.  Early adopters are getting paid, but it isn't a zero-sum game.  The utility provided by BTC outweighs the cost of achieving a higher market cap.  The idea isn't to become the one world currency (some people may disagree), but to let the the little folk do things financially that shouldn't cost money, but the current system taxes them for.
@_date: 2013-12-02 20:08:59
This question is asked literally every hour in this subreddit.  This is a place filled with true believers and reddit already is a system that promotes a hive mind.  Most people posting here believe bitcoins will be worth more than they are now.  Don't take investing advice from reddit.  Make up your own mind.
@_date: 2013-11-26 20:11:06
That's good.  I'd still recommend escrow though.  Just look at bitcoin/new to see how often people get scammed.
@_date: 2013-12-12 17:57:33
I can't take this guy seriously.
@_date: 2013-12-04 18:25:08
Sometimes when a public ledger and cryptography love each other very much...
@_date: 2013-11-26 19:53:46
escrow, this guys sounds shady
@_date: 2013-12-05 00:48:41
Places that take bitcoin list their prices in traditional currency, then convert at the register.  That way it doesn't affect them.
@_date: 2013-12-04 01:00:43
Skeptics.  People who are convinced it is a ponzi scheme.  They only have the best intentions.
@_date: 2013-12-01 08:37:06
BTC isn't better than USD.  It is different.  It isn't a competition.  Like credit cards and debit cards, it's a financial technology.  The first credit cards were just clubs for specific restaurants.  I'm sure most people guffawed and questioned why they were better than cash or checks (lol, remember those) at the time.
@_date: 2013-11-26 19:27:35
There is a difference between accounting fraud and a speculatory bubble.  No need to be so patronizing.
@_date: 2013-12-03 04:17:44
It's a new tech.  They want to categorize it so they can apply their knowledge to it.  
@_date: 2013-12-12 19:25:31
And what's with the shitty litecoin DLC?
@_date: 2013-11-26 16:55:56
Yes.  You are basically paying someone a $40 convenience charge.
@_date: 2013-12-03 04:09:23
Many people find that use of the word retarded to be offensive.  Nobody thinks the only real value of BTC is scarcity.  There are  links to the right you can follow if you are genuinely interested in learning about bitcoins.
