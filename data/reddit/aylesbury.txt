If only you'd know how obnoxious you people are.

I remember when Bitcoins were like 30€ or so and I thought it would be a bit steep for a gamble and something that would probably never take off. Fuck me. Anyhow. Who would actually trust John McAfee's advice about investment?

Yeah, you are right. I'll make sure and ask my gypsy astrologer next time such a situation arises. Bitcoin was utterly unpredictable and people who claim that they've seen it coming are smug liars or idiots who don't have the hindsight that their investment was rather dangerous, though it did pay off.

Bitcoin is essentially a VERY easy way to make loads of money just disappear. I predict people will one day set up accounts in tax havens to distract from their Bitcoin wallets. If that becomes common practice that people put their money out of sight and reach of their governments then Bitcoin will be crushed on an international level. There is absolutely no way anyone person could ever know about how much money you roughly have unless you tell them and that's pretty spectacular.

Did a google search and it said one is worth 2000 something something USD. I'm sure it'll stabilize some day, but when and at how much is an important question. It certainly is an important currency for spending wherever conventional payment methods fail. Hell, PayPal still doesn't even do porn sites. I need to look into that though, because if it dips to 50$ it does sounds good to me. I can see how price swings could happen if someone's shoving a couple million USD around, making them disappear, or some ransomware making it big. Bitcoin feels more like stocks that are being used as currency and that are utterly uncontrolled. Be careful with actual gambling though. The house always wins - with Bitcoin at least there is no house.

I assume the picture linked is a bit older, eh? :P

It isn't so much the people who invested in them as an investment, but those who use them, which still mainly means drug dealers, and people who launder money.
