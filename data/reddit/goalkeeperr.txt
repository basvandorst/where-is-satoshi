nooo we need Gavin to make many decisions for us again and again!
@_date: 2015-06-22 09:38:03
@_date: 2015-06-19 20:19:17
check Mike's history, he talked crap since early days
@_date: 2015-06-19 20:23:26
stop talking about scam coins as if they are relevant or accepted anywhere. 
@_date: 2015-06-22 18:34:51
75% is too little, 100% for 18 months would be spot on
@_date: 2015-06-03 00:23:55
I like
@_date: 2015-06-27 22:51:57
waiting for confirmations doesn't work well, LN will solve that and reduce fees, pp are going to use it.
@_date: 2015-06-03 00:40:22
aka ShapeShift and coinbase should stop relying on zero conf
@_date: 2015-06-24 07:53:25
who cares about someone that hasn't been involved for years? for that matter Gavin hasn't been involved in 1+ ys
@_date: 2015-06-16 07:53:33
Hearn above consensus. Hearn dictates how it's going to happen, no matter what!
@_date: 2015-06-24 12:13:29
that's assuming people move to XT which is not a given. beside, core can do a different block increase like bip100
@_date: 2015-06-27 22:08:09
I use Bitcoin often enough to make LN more convenient and as fee will go up it will be even more convenient. besides, you can't do micropayments on chain either way.
instead of doing 120 transaction a year on chain I could easily reduce that to &lt; 10 and make many more transaction for much less
@_date: 2015-06-23 01:07:58

let's not gamble with what the future will be! no need for undue risk
@_date: 2015-06-11 08:36:54
better solution for fees? like paying market fees?
@_date: 2015-06-06 10:31:45
not for years, Gavin needs to understand he is not the CEO or anything
@_date: 2015-06-22 23:41:45
yeah which is the amount you sent and which the change address? miner doesn't know.
@_date: 2015-06-23 09:02:19
not if Gavin has to profit from it am I right guais?
@_date: 2015-06-12 17:09:41
sure, just anti economical, fee will be substantial going forward
@_date: 2015-06-02 16:41:51
maybe I should start arguing for 500k block sizes, you know, to get us to stay on 1MB :)

wtf? he first threatened and then just did the bip, wtf are you talking about?
who said they would use XT specifically?
@_date: 2015-06-14 21:43:47
nodes too
@_date: 2015-06-05 20:05:30
if you try to send ltc to a Bitcoin p2sh address they go and if you look on the blockchain you'll find them and they never move
@_date: 2015-06-24 10:29:42
I doubt it
@_date: 2015-06-21 21:02:17
poor Gavin :( technical people and cryptopunk don't understand him
@_date: 2015-06-19 23:28:12
aren't you a butter?

fifty shades of scams
@_date: 2015-06-04 23:56:58
how bad are lite developers?
how many times litecoiners sent litecoins to bitcoin P2SH addresses by mistake and lost them?
because the lite devs didn't bother with changing the addresses when they merged the source from bitcoin
was doge also this stupid? does doge even have p2sh?
@_date: 2015-06-24 19:59:54
just because Mike is a lazy bugger doesn't mean it's not an alt
@_date: 2015-06-26 21:12:11
sextillion beople
@_date: 2015-06-11 07:05:52
that doesn't change with big block size, you still have to resubmit with a higher fee if the block is full which is bound to happen every so often
@_date: 2015-06-11 17:33:29
except bitcoin has peak and non peak hours, fees will be different
@_date: 2015-06-24 22:42:19
things change!!!!!!!
@_date: 2015-06-05 16:00:51
what central authority? spreading FUD much?
@_date: 2015-06-24 17:55:06
not really, there are alts that hard forked off litecoin and now are independent
@_date: 2015-06-05 15:19:42
altruistic or cutting off the other miners profitability and further centralize
@_date: 2015-06-19 23:36:25
Gavin should tell us about his Coinbase consulting
@_date: 2015-06-26 06:43:10
makes sense if you don't think about it
@_date: 2015-06-22 23:45:43
one proposal is to cap the block size. the other to uncap/increase it non stop and then increase the 21M with some 2-3% annual inflation.
I'm for a hard cap. better decentralization and no shitty inflation
@_date: 2015-06-02 15:55:35
or maybe nobody cares about shitcoins. does litecoin even have a Dev team?
@_date: 2015-06-22 06:02:27
@_date: 2015-06-05 14:58:02
were you at fault for the problem or was it someone else fault?
@_date: 2015-06-20 11:18:19
that's not true, there's not even a BIP yet, let alone code
@_date: 2015-06-12 17:43:30
theoretical my ass, people that are opposed to Gavin are because Gavin wants to destroy bitcoin
@_date: 2015-06-02 16:04:56
mining was very very different then, no asics.
@_date: 2015-06-12 07:25:43
true story
@_date: 2015-06-12 17:13:53
this proposal seems stupid, miners are anonymous if they want and betting on them to do the right thing is nonsense
@_date: 2015-06-05 19:52:14
you are mistaken, P2SH starts with 3 in btc and so does with ltc. used among other things for multisig.
 the one you mention is P2PKH
@_date: 2015-06-05 20:22:10
you don't understand because distributed and decentralized systems are complex and unintuitive
@_date: 2015-06-26 18:00:55
sorry the only one looking like an idiot is you
@_date: 2015-06-03 22:41:28
the error is thinking bitcoin has a lead Dev or some sort of chief scientist. 
for example I think that Gavin does not count more than Chris Patia. 
for the record I think both are pretty bad developers and Gavin is a terrible leader not leader although I can recognize his social skills and political predisposition
@_date: 2015-06-19 23:33:57
you rather have then continue to XT than core? egoistical
@_date: 2015-06-13 10:30:06
users are not being told the full picture, users want increased transaction rate not bigger blocks, if only they knew 
@_date: 2015-06-26 20:29:33
don't care what he dose in altcoinland
@_date: 2015-06-20 19:31:22
gavincoin is a scam
@_date: 2015-06-22 23:19:03
what about countries behind? 
are they not worthy of Bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-06-03 23:10:55
bip44 can be used with litecoin, but seed reuse is dumb, isn't bip44 the result of SatoshiLabs supporting scamcoins? WTF
@_date: 2015-06-28 17:33:45
he is 50% right 50% wrong
@_date: 2015-06-20 12:15:29
they like a proposal, doesn't mean they would support a contentious hardfork with XT or Gavhearn as dictator, no way, they are much smarter than that @_date: 2015-06-02 15:56:19
yeah that's already more reasonable
@_date: 2015-06-01 08:29:29
nobody accepts alts
@_date: 2015-06-13 08:37:11
well deserved too
@_date: 2015-06-16 17:31:39
dude big difference donations vs advertising
@_date: 2015-06-24 19:47:24
you don't get it, do you? bugs means alt and no software has no bugs
@_date: 2015-06-05 15:22:37
be should leave Bitcoin core
@_date: 2015-06-24 17:56:37
if contentious we should fight it just like the XT alt coin
@_date: 2015-06-24 12:28:10
informative but omitting risks and with simplistic simulation and analysis
@_date: 2015-06-22 23:53:37
the question is, why would Gavin do this?
ego? money? danger? all of the options?
@_date: 2015-06-16 01:32:41
dude there is no rush, you don't get it, fine, move on, what's *you r* contribution armchair Gavihern cheerleader?
@_date: 2015-06-24 19:50:34
it would not be the first alt which shares part of its blockchain with some coin 
@_date: 2015-06-11 17:38:24
he don't care about consensus, he can lobby miners wallets and exchange remember? 
when was it last that Gavin contributed to core, 2 years ago? time to remove his access from core I say
@_date: 2015-06-22 23:32:45
neither proposal may meet the requirements
@_date: 2015-06-23 21:00:33
no the signed message wouldn't be on chain
@_date: 2015-06-25 08:09:27

@_date: 2015-06-23 09:05:29

@_date: 2015-06-23 00:50:11
lol, if nobody goes there there is no fee pressure and is not expensive.
try again
@_date: 2015-06-24 19:45:28
it's sad we got ignorant people pushing their views as if they had understanding
@_date: 2015-06-19 23:27:04
with big blocks they can hide behind network issues
@_date: 2015-06-24 14:21:34
it is getting fuller because it can, natural or not, and, it will lead to centralization, maybe that's OK, maybe not.

they now partnered with bitgo, the one that sends all funds as fee by mistake sometimes
@_date: 2015-06-23 00:07:11
you should reread parent proposal, basing fees on amount moved does not work.
@_date: 2015-06-21 16:33:54
it's in line with Gavin's claim that we are out of the recession!
@_date: 2015-06-22 16:12:32
which they didn't invent? they just started looking into it, isn't it true?
@_date: 2015-06-02 22:38:24
zero conf is not safe, anyone telling you otherwise is either ignorant or willfully cheating you
check out gangsta, a double spend tool that makes it easier
@_date: 2015-06-19 20:24:54
that's why we should keep the cap
@_date: 2015-06-19 23:27:48
not with the block size alone no
only some incompetent developers would have you believe otherwise
@_date: 2015-06-04 07:18:46
how do you tell bitcoind to do that?
@_date: 2015-06-26 21:25:08
this is stupid how are you going to pay miners?
@_date: 2015-06-27 22:14:42
it's actually very likely if you think about it. no block cap means miners have to be subsidised somehow

which fits Mike too

he hasn't earned shit, he talks well I can concede but he is a lazy bum
@_date: 2015-06-24 07:52:02
do you exclusively comment about the block size? between jobs or sumthin'?
@_date: 2015-06-05 15:13:30
not necessarily, in the example on the mailing list it causes increased orphans to miners not as well connected (like in China)
Gavin you lied on the mailing list and you lied again here? did you refute the notion?
@_date: 2015-06-19 21:01:30
he claims Bitcoin will die when the block is full because people would move to other things (ripple? dogecoin? litecoin? lol)
@_date: 2015-06-22 05:59:15
Gavin says [otherwise](
imagine, blocks so big we can embed torrents!
@_date: 2015-06-07 20:55:41
fuck closed source wallets
@_date: 2015-06-19 22:30:20
if you are not cheap your transactions will go just fine
@_date: 2015-06-23 09:03:53
die painfully vs die more painfully, great isn't it?
@_date: 2015-06-27 22:56:07
without pressure there's no reason to believe miners will be compensated enough
@_date: 2015-06-23 12:06:33
my bad. 
in my defense, Gavin already skipped the civil process with his XT threat and it is easy to exaggerate when Gavin himself exaggerated the support for his proposal and heavily underestimated the risks and even omitted them.
I appreciate your contributions and hope you can quickly go back on Lightening development.  go Rusty, go!
@_date: 2015-06-24 22:41:34
fat and fast downvoting of anyone not convinced of the threats and analysis made by the unilateral duo
@_date: 2015-06-01 19:57:21
I still wouldn't accept alts
@_date: 2015-06-24 07:47:11
as long as Gavin omits (or underestimates) the risks it doesn't matter, people will be fooled by him
@_date: 2015-06-20 22:15:00
ZOMG what happened to small steps
@_date: 2015-06-27 21:59:06
free request? via apis?
@_date: 2015-06-24 07:47:58
your solution to this is "let's make it more centralized with Gavin" ?
@_date: 2015-06-22 06:19:37
all of the above? I used to be BTC CEO but then I faked my death
@_date: 2015-06-23 00:46:01
what happens during downtime to BRIC?
@_date: 2015-06-23 00:41:51
why should I ever accept GoldHopeCoin? alts will be cheap only when nobody uses them. thank you but no thank you
@_date: 2015-06-04 20:56:05
not open source yet? but...why?
@_date: 2015-06-24 17:00:25
yes it's better to have the same bugs than having a hard fork
@_date: 2015-06-22 23:48:31
miner winning the most gets a nice weekend in Aspen with Gavin and Peter.
lose-lose-lose situation
@_date: 2015-06-16 07:59:26
Gavin is that you?
@_date: 2015-06-16 01:36:17
algorithmic scale needed, not block size
@_date: 2015-06-27 07:52:10
no, Mike and finway and cipherdoc2 are also outside the conspiracy together with Gavin, the rest is illuminati
@_date: 2015-06-12 17:16:15
yes, let's give control to miners alone, they will never screw up
@_date: 2015-06-26 18:02:53
he is already out of lead isn't he?!
@_date: 2015-06-23 08:51:54
others making hazardous proposal and threatening a contentious hard fork? who? I tell you who, nobody.

what a loser
@_date: 2015-06-05 15:10:56
what are the risks of a consensus fork with this software? is Mike Hearn a reliable Dev? I'm worried he never contributed to core and the little that he has down had caused forks in the past
people stay away from this!
@_date: 2014-12-31 21:53:41
I don't know too much about it but so far I think so
@_date: 2015-06-23 07:40:49

comments like these are part of the reasons I never suggest people to use mycelium, you are just don't have enough of a clue when it comes to bitcoin.
when you said the above did you even stop for a second thinking of orphan blocks and how often they happen?
what about replace by fee enabled by some pools?
you got a decent basic understanding but you should do more homework, simple as that

open tcpdump on your WiFi to see it or read the code. 
that variable I pointed to is set to BC.I and it is used for both currency rates and sweeping.
find in the page on github blockchain.info and follow the variable/code into the network request to get blockchain data from BC.I for sweeping

too bad you are not worried about that.
I used to think like you but history has proven me wrong.
by the way, the code for bitcoin authenticator could do with some reviews and much better error checking, it seems like code I would expect from some undergraduate learning how to code (which is fine but not great if people trust it with real BTC)
@_date: 2014-12-31 16:58:29
ultimately claiming that one confirmation is enough for a transaction for $100k worth is dumb and you should know better.
just because you haven't seen someone hit by it it doesn't mean that a transaction included by the block orphanizing the block with 1 confirm couldn't contain a replace by fee version.
a miner can actively try to orphan a block if it has 100k worth of incentives
I think you demonstrated mycelium is developed by junior bitcoin developers (the network monitor builtin is another example, not secure at all, a false security sense.)

I expect lightening to be used for the most part and confirmation services that use some child pays for parent mechanism to make sure my transaction gets confirmed without forcing me to stay online increasing the fee by some kind of rbf mechanism.
I can always pay a lot and expect high priority and stay online and add fee as needed if I need to be confirmed working a number of blocks or time
it's OK if you check the latest few blocks and mempool before deciding the fee and can be all automated

increasing the block size is a mere workaround, doesn't scale. calling payment channels or lightening network unrealistic is not fair as they are very possible, it just need a soft fork, not a hard fork like increasing the block size (which will happen eventually)

why not now?
@_date: 2015-05-27 23:32:02
a miner with 20% of the network has advantages with bigger blocks compared to a 1% miner as it reduces competition (and thus increase centralization)
you can't deny that developers advocating for 20 Mb to be pushed out immediately have been consulting with major bitcoin companies that rely on 0 confirmation and some are bleeding because of double spend which become more effective as blocks are full
@_date: 2015-05-31 17:23:14
@_date: 2015-05-10 11:29:50
@_date: 2015-05-26 21:30:39
it's only a done deal if the price doesn't move under you, and looking at past block fees is easy to estimate fees
@_date: 2015-05-26 19:49:54
the price is a market, or should be, just like bitcoin in dollars.
 you wouldn't think bitcoin would be ok if pegged to the dollar would you?
 block space is limited just like bitcoin are limited to 21 M,  kB on blocks fluctuates like the bitcoin price does, scarcity being the keyword
@_date: 2015-05-28 22:17:12
why less security? I thought the problem was timeouts
@_date: 2015-05-26 16:53:32
malleability needs to be worked on before we talk about increasing the block size, which we probably must do eventually
Your experience on payment channels is useful how given they are useless right now with malleability going on?
increasing the block size is just a work around, far from being a real scalability solution!

a secure element in theory does not leak, sadly your average phone does and bitcoin authenticator has crappy code ignoring exceptions (check github), one of the devs is a scammer/pump dumper behind isracoin and the mobile app blindly signs data encrypted by the paired computer when it should verify unspent outputs against the blockchain and it promotes bad behaviour (integrates services that encourage address reuse like onename), claims to be distributed when is not (as it uses Google servers to notify the app)
the idea is reasonable and the implementation can be fixed, needs to use the secure element on the phone if available, improve the code quality, avoid scammy devs, verify outputs and drop bad integrations as well as empty/false claims
all possible but it appears these guys are more into sexy interfaces, who can blame them when individuals do fall for it

you listed many more things than just security and I wanted to learn more about the various apps before commenting further but, I didn't try them all I looked briefly at the open source ones (although you have no guarantee for any of the wallets above that you are indeed running the unmodified open source version)
in terms of looks I like breadwallet and hive, this though is entirely subjective and not having tried the closed source ones I may be missing out on pretty apps
from a privacy prospective anything using a server can snoop on you so that includes all but bread wallet yet I can imagine it is trivial to sniff all the SPV traffic over a WiFi and there is no bloom filter when spending and is also possible to run a man in the middle attack which is not possible with SSLed traffic. 
would you say this is in line with your understanding? I guess there are pros and cons to SPV. I also fear adding for TOR support just moves the Sybil attack doesn't prevent them (unless you want to adopt Mike Hearn's proof of passport /s)
from a security prospective, if a security exploit was found on the device allowing apps to take the keys or sign with it seems like multisignature would be the only thing saving you from theft, so that ought to make it safer unless I'm missing something

before trezor, were you involved in hardware security with banking or military strength?
@_date: 2015-01-03 03:34:39
once you find out you act instead of continue to give credibility to scammers.
I'm writing down everyone defending this pesky shit
@_date: 2015-01-08 09:11:29
that is if bitstamp knows what happened and knows fiat balanced are unaffected for sure
@_date: 2015-01-14 19:57:59
I agree with you
@_date: 2015-01-03 03:47:43
bruce Fenton said he would and for that I lost respect
@_date: 2015-01-05 04:23:07
was the crash led by stamp yesterday?

and cry as it goes up
@_date: 2015-01-29 15:26:28
for that matter satoshilabs and co (slush and co) are less than qualified
@_date: 2015-01-06 07:32:36
you would expect fewer differences in different versions than in totally different  implementations, no doubt
@_date: 2015-01-01 01:47:32
I don't know, are exchanges that got litecoin or dogecoin having a standard? maybe those are not scam alright but meh
alts are only possibly interesting from a technical point of view
@_date: 2015-01-17 03:56:19
I don't even!! 
even with a screen how do you know the address wasn't changed before it was passed to the device ?? THINK!
@_date: 2015-01-10 14:03:09
I for one would not trust some shit put together in a hurry like this, in particular if you consider the PR bullshit of one line of code from Ben Davenport CPO of BitGo.
what do you know that we don't and why would anyone defend a company in the bitcoin ecosystem that patents stuff like multisignature?
@_date: 2015-01-08 14:50:46
isn't this just wishful thinking? we just don't know
@_date: 2015-01-01 00:15:57
wtf did they really buy the domain just to make the scam look  slightly less scammy?
@_date: 2015-01-10 21:39:09
I said hardware, embedded security. nothing like that
@_date: 2015-01-14 19:27:49
oh kinda like my grandama and internet, she don't care
@_date: 2015-01-05 03:37:53
thanks for asking, yes, litecoin is not innovative in any way and provides no added value, it is not GPU or asics resistant as claimed and  apparently the weak scrypt parameters were done on propose to mine on GPU in advance of everyone else (thus scamming)
you were saying?

you need some infrastructure to make it work in any meaningful way and I don't see how this is going to work smoothly without said infrastructure (which is more than this single project should bite)
@_date: 2015-01-10 13:05:18
you assume this will keep at this volume and that they don't have  operational costs
@_date: 2015-01-07 20:00:01
but will they keep current volumes? not a given

@_date: 2015-01-10 20:54:53
no, impossible, this has to be fake.
if there's anything common in scams like paycoin and gaw is that they are flashy and they scam you in style
@_date: 2015-01-18 17:02:26
not secure if you use the website and the app has no technical reviews
@_date: 2015-01-20 14:25:53

the pin can be bypassed according to researchers
@_date: 2015-01-17 04:58:37
every hardware wallet does that by definition, does it not?
the screen doesn't help if you have no way of knowing the address shown on screen is the intended recipient address, from a separate source than the one to which the trezor is connected to
@_date: 2015-01-01 01:34:08
I agree with OP but if we boycott services that support scams we are left with services that only support BTC (and fiat when applicable)
so be it
@_date: 2015-01-19 17:23:06
the security part is probably related to TREZOR using a standard microcontroller that provides little to no security if the device is stolen and the seed is not using a passphrase. the ecdsa code appears to be subject to side channel attacks too.
@_date: 2015-01-05 05:34:25

@_date: 2015-01-14 22:02:32
what's the point?
@_date: 2015-01-11 17:45:38
didn't nullc say that trezor is weak to side channels? it may be enough to connect it and sign a transaction to extract the private keys
@_date: 2015-01-31 21:59:36
you can still do this with TPM and uefi
@_date: 2015-01-08 02:32:04
the question is how: bad random or server hack? external or internal? you can't redeploy or build your servers if you don't know the cause of the hack and its extend and we haven't been told much if not vague statements and prolonged ETAs

when does cool wallet ship? until then we are comparing apples and oranges are we not?
@_date: 2015-01-01 17:43:21
I didn't get the common practise for closed server side comment but I found out that GreenAddress uses electrum client side to validate the server data and I though that was the best of both worlds.
using a VPN or other things like that is working around the problem and is not user friendly
I like bread wallet more from a usability prospective, simpler &amp; easier (I still have to find out how to create new addresses though) but indeed I wish I could use multisig on it for stronger security with a service like cryptocorp or greenaddrrss etc
how is a jail brake happening if not via exploits? why do you even have to suggest that bread wallet is not recommended on rooted devices if not for this exact problem?

do they support 2of3 too?
@_date: 2015-01-03 03:00:00
what part of taking money from scammers don't you understand? the conference should be boycotted until they stop taking the sponsorship. if they do that then they can do the QA but otherwise this is just profiting off scammers profiting off gullible people and bitpay should know better

Gavin is playing politics and disregarding Bitcoin consensus because is not convenient for the businesses speaking privately to him
majority of core devs seems in agreement that more research _has_ to be done before any block increase is merged
hard forking Bitcoin is his reaction to lack of consensus and doesn't bode well
should this happen, regardless of uptake, his commit privileges on the original repo should be removed at the very least as forking attempts should not be seen as amicable actions, they are a big risk for the blockchain and rallying people in reddit that are mostly disinformed is a poor decision

the more I read the more I think you are well intentioned so keep up the good work but be mindful when you say it is the best if you are not sure if the others may or may not do things as securely (or more securely for that matter).

dude stop it with the spam 
@_date: 2015-08-18 09:52:45
yes we did thanks Dave
p.s. feed your pets, they are always hungry when we break in your place

you have to learn to make it a lesson

@_date: 2015-08-12 06:57:51
what a cry baby
@_date: 2015-08-09 16:32:54
as if that helps with kyc aml and NYC banks
@_date: 2015-08-04 13:38:39
what about China and the internet firewall they have?
blocks would propagate fast in mainland and slow outside and they have the majority of the hashing %
Sipa's simulation demonstrated an increased block size is a strong centralization pressure, how can you argue that?
@_date: 2015-08-02 13:09:11
I'll believe it when mtgox adds it on the exchange
@_date: 2015-08-03 08:04:12
good luck implementing that bug for bug
@_date: 2015-08-11 23:37:59
jstolfi is a butthurt buttcoiner with a wasted career
@_date: 2015-08-29 14:40:12
they are very suspect
@_date: 2015-08-13 09:38:35
oh boi
@_date: 2015-08-29 10:37:51
@_date: 2015-08-11 23:10:42
Gavin and Mike wasting everyone's time at best and breaking Bitcoin if we are not so lucky.
great, thank you for not being sheeple !!!! XT FTW!!  to the doom!
@_date: 2015-08-04 20:34:09
notaries, payment channels and lightning
@_date: 2015-08-10 07:20:47
the XT monkeys never are
@_date: 2015-08-11 06:45:21
appealing to authority
@_date: 2015-08-18 17:38:19
not really safe, it has to stay forked for a while
@_date: 2015-08-10 18:01:07
it doesn't know for sure
@_date: 2015-08-04 08:29:57
like XT
@_date: 2015-08-18 08:23:34
using NoXT is the best defence from XT attacking the network
@_date: 2015-08-10 07:13:16
it's far from a guarantee. it's a vote and you don't know the real intentions of those voting
@_date: 2015-08-16 07:26:24
XT could be buggy, who is reviewing it? Mike? 
@_date: 2015-08-09 20:21:57
eth is a scam anyway
@_date: 2015-08-07 07:49:18
they map the electorate? ;)
@_date: 2015-08-14 20:49:13
that's nuts. 
this is not good regulation. it requires too much money and that cuts off the vast majority of start ups.
@_date: 2015-08-18 15:15:25
patenting key generation is as scummy as patenting multisignature
@_date: 2015-08-18 17:20:02
in XT try can remove it, why haven't they done so?
@_date: 2015-08-16 07:40:38
so different that Peter Todd's Replace By Fee allows to double spend transactions using XT as a relay
@_date: 2015-08-28 21:34:27
I don't do osx so no apple but still better than XP. what is orange? a fork of Darwin?

so true
@_date: 2015-08-11 06:49:55
I agree with him
@_date: 2015-08-11 19:18:04
lightning was created after blockstream was founded, just saying
@_date: 2015-08-11 23:49:30
relax it was a real fix announced on April's fool
@_date: 2015-08-15 17:26:03
Put in other words it would be some damage if people pay more than needed. Elsewhere I agree with your points.
@_date: 2015-08-04 20:29:36
why should they be critical?
@_date: 2015-08-18 08:31:04
Gavin says one thing and does another
@_date: 2015-08-14 17:05:32
are people really still linking to BC.I ?!!? how do you not even know their data and service$ are completely screwed!
@_date: 2015-08-15 13:24:52
fuck ids
@_date: 2015-08-10 07:03:20
that's a big assumption right there. 
XT nodes have no idea what voted or activated the 75%, what if enough core miners make XT miners waste asics power on a hard fork without the majority? 
@_date: 2015-08-16 11:10:21
XT is comedy gold, a scammy alt bootstrapped by a rogue scummy dev and his buddy.
@_date: 2015-08-15 13:38:56
not known by anyone
@_date: 2015-08-31 14:10:08
or dumb enough to use hard coded Bitcoin fees and have transactions never confirm.........
@_date: 2015-08-03 08:13:48
college fund too
@_date: 2015-08-11 06:50:41
well put.
XT is an attack to the network
@_date: 2015-08-27 00:03:15
cut the bs
@_date: 2015-08-25 20:34:55
should have started from the mailing list. which companies did you speak to?
@_date: 2015-08-18 18:49:23
that's 4mb blocks already then
@_date: 2015-08-09 16:44:43
satoshi was anonymous and he decided to disappear, maybe he left because of the coercing risk
@_date: 2015-08-26 18:34:49
that paper is from Peter R a dude that doesn't know the difference between a blockchain and a pizza
@_date: 2015-08-16 10:45:38
and what's your résumé? expert in trolling? master in bullshit?
@_date: 2015-08-12 14:16:11
@_date: 2015-08-26 07:37:19
people would move away from the pool surely?
@_date: 2015-08-12 07:03:14
little demand for micropayments? are you nuts?
Bitcoin can't do micropayments without payment channels and Lightning, those transactions can't be on chain
@_date: 2015-08-02 12:31:37
the latter but the former is just an arbitrary number without any simulation or reasoning. an ugly and unnecessary hack, dangerous too without some supermajority
@_date: 2015-08-04 10:10:47
Peter is not deciding, the market is
@_date: 2015-08-28 08:25:52
you invest in shit all the time: ripple, BC.I, illegal fireworks, ugly ass website
@_date: 2015-08-19 13:51:10
do you have signed proof from a known key from someone from blockstream?
otherwise you have no way of proving this and given your past failed accusations without proof and your conflicts of interests with the foundation and lighthouse ... it is only normal that some people have doubts about you ........
@_date: 2015-08-11 22:54:10
any sufficiently large minority (more than one clueless dude) that doesn't agree means that there is no consensus. it can be devs or miners or nodes or services like bitrated, get the trend?
@_date: 2015-08-18 17:18:06
like PayPal Visa MasterCard and American Express?
I advocate changes to keep up with technology and keep a safe level of decentralization. I'm in favor of bigger blocks in core when it will become viable
@_date: 2015-08-19 10:03:53
that is just your opinion man
reckless people are going to crush against a wall
@_date: 2015-08-11 22:57:01
said the hater
@_date: 2015-08-18 15:13:58
tl;Dr; bigger blocks but not with XT
@_date: 2015-08-11 18:22:28
let's hope we don't get two permanent chains
@_date: 2015-08-18 09:51:28
what else to expect from a company hiring Ryan X Charles???

@_date: 2015-08-05 19:11:16
nah, correct in the eyes of most of the network
@_date: 2015-08-15 09:04:49
no exchange has announced support for XT
@_date: 2015-08-02 11:09:11
you can't be seriously be saying fuck TOR.....you really don't get Bitcoin then
@_date: 2015-08-09 17:44:10
since when is kraken from running?/
@_date: 2015-08-15 15:43:38
it is OK for core maybe but most of all other software still needs some dynamic work
@_date: 2015-08-04 19:33:06
classic 
@_date: 2015-08-11 23:21:50
OK, if B.info says something it must be fucked up like the rest of what they do right? 
how can incompetent people even know what diligent and reasonable even mean let alone vouch for others,??
don't forget to check your signatures and to get your entropy from random.org!!!!
@_date: 2015-08-11 08:37:18
how many exchanges and miners have committed to it? I count 0
@_date: 2015-08-18 07:55:58
0 miners right now 
@_date: 2015-08-15 14:06:35
your genes are not null but may considered so
@_date: 2015-08-28 21:14:38

you are the one that wants to make tor not possible
@_date: 2015-08-30 16:41:15
no surprises there, the guy is arrogant and not very competent
@_date: 2015-08-14 21:07:43
Ryan X Charles, a man with an XMen sounding name but no super powers and ultra unlucky
a man that left bitpay than Reddit then bitgo, attempted work on decentralized WiFi and then moved to work on decentralized Reddit.
people that saw him recently said he is working on a cancer cure.
he attempted to rewrite core in JavaScript and forked his own fork while he moved across companies.
a man, an idea man.
if butters are right about something that is how much of a failure this guy is
proper comedy gold
@_date: 2015-08-16 07:23:51
stop with your logic, this is about emotional brigading not logic
@_date: 2015-08-11 07:00:10
the only interesting distinction is that with a forkcoin there is an attack on the current set of users, with the simple alt is just a new independent coin
@_date: 2015-08-18 16:34:10
they are *not* fees they are a donation!
@_date: 2015-08-13 07:25:58
that's not limited to 8, it doubles...

hey guis I found another smallblockista, take the forks out!!
@_date: 2015-08-14 16:56:12
when was it last hard forked intentionally? source?
@_date: 2015-08-10 07:07:55
there's already for the new alt coin

wishful baseless claim
@_date: 2015-08-02 11:14:53
jstolfi is a butthurt computer science professor that spends all his time trying to discredit Bitcoin and why it shouldn't work
we should feel honored he loves Mike and Gavin and circle and intelligence services and hates blockstream and its devs.
 jstolfi is a great resource, just invert the sentiment and you get a safe bet
@_date: 2015-08-11 06:52:54
satoshi left a long time ago. stop the appeal to authority, Bitcoin needs no boss
@_date: 2015-08-02 13:05:12
I find 2mb a bit of a waste of time, reasonable for absolute emergences yet to be demonstrated. with votes it is less problematic but far from ideal
@_date: 2015-08-19 08:53:05
bitcoin is not a start up and the price has nothing to do with LN if anything it is affected by the uncertainty caused by the hostile take over attempt being pushed by the XT proponents also known as centralizers, freedom Cripplers, privacy destroyers
@_date: 2015-08-15 13:38:10
absolutists are limited.
there is more than the largest nowadays
@_date: 2015-08-14 17:02:45
no chocking involved unless that's your perversion
@_date: 2015-08-18 17:39:30
like litecoin?
@_date: 2015-08-19 13:53:29
Oliver is working with Gavin .. Gavin remains the chief scientist at the failstation ... he can't go against his boss or against his 'investment' in lighthouse
@_date: 2015-08-15 14:15:05
I'm for reasonable consensus based block size, nothing like the current proposals from anyone
It would be not be terrible if we had high fees and all at once sharply a drop but it would cause some kind of adjustment.
all in all it is important people get used to dynamic adjustment
@_date: 2015-08-16 07:45:16
you too onboard with these "conflict of interest"? you should know better
@_date: 2015-07-06 07:45:50
is there any good finance minister in pigs?
@_date: 2015-08-11 23:00:39
the needed changes are a non controversial soft fork 
@_date: 2015-08-11 06:53:32
that's a hardfork with ttwo chains: the new one ain't Bitcoin
@_date: 2015-08-16 21:05:03
to be fair there are proposal now and simulations, the ones pushing while the analysis is ongoing are Mike and Gavin
@_date: 2015-08-10 07:37:31
changetip sucks, Bitcoin tip bot was the real deal
@_date: 2015-08-03 13:06:57
frappucinifaction intensifies
@_date: 2015-08-15 13:27:59
now is about largest volumes? go get greatly goxed me boi
@_date: 2015-07-30 19:38:44
because electrum is a canary, next up core with too big blocks
@_date: 2015-07-17 19:41:16
you really want and need both
@_date: 2015-08-02 11:32:00
it would not be a fake fork, the 1mb+ blocks miners would be less than 51% and waste hashing power thinking they are the majority
@_date: 2015-08-07 17:16:59
Mike wants to make Bitcoin the new PayPal and frankly, fuck that shit
@_date: 2015-07-25 10:18:31
you forget that miners can fake that vote, even almost accidentally like with bip066.
@_date: 2015-08-19 15:19:24
everyone created it? one created it
@_date: 2015-08-12 15:42:26
hang him!
@_date: 2015-08-19 14:37:00
same here
@_date: 2015-08-11 08:38:38
not rational to you
@_date: 2015-08-12 15:53:47
it can. and a hardfork is even worse, extremely stupid without consensus.
@_date: 2015-08-19 16:01:07
more like a data entry chap
@_date: 2015-08-14 17:07:21
like..... estimated fees?
ledger, mycelium and many others have updated since
@_date: 2015-07-28 13:57:28
he could be a Ryan x charles
@_date: 2015-07-30 17:04:09
with that mentality, if you were right at all, Gavin would have prepared a proposal with no limit at all
@_date: 2015-07-24 08:13:18
if user base grows so has to do the number of nodes to maintain security. it's not the raw number of nodes but the ratio that matters
@_date: 2015-07-09 17:36:23
can't you save the page locally, review the code and use it? or does it do signing stuff server side?
@_date: 2015-08-02 11:25:27
satoshi hasn't contributed to the debate in years
@_date: 2015-07-29 08:09:52
just old wallets not coping with fees, they will or they will fade away
@_date: 2015-07-14 21:32:06
gambling on block size?
@_date: 2015-08-16 09:45:01
that was a different email
@_date: 2015-08-16 11:13:12
are you for or against a contentious hard fork using XT as a vehicle?
hard to understand your stance other than making up drama on twitter
@_date: 2015-08-01 08:39:22
servers frappucinoed
@_date: 2015-08-11 07:48:41
wishful thinking. 
@_date: 2015-08-12 07:14:05
XT: bigger than litecoin, funnier than dogecoin, scammier than Nxt
@_date: 2015-07-30 11:38:12
not indefinitely it auto increases based on time. pretty foolish.
@_date: 2015-07-13 08:31:14
you just need to improve your reading comprehending skills and look in the mailing list
@_date: 2015-07-24 09:10:23
because economists are pulsating shit
@_date: 2015-07-30 18:04:54
@_date: 2015-07-31 08:45:41
bread crumbs wallet should fix it
@_date: 2015-08-13 07:29:56
you don't want people to prove 8mb isn't bad, you want people to prove 8mb is OK and there ain't any proof
@_date: 2015-07-31 08:45:08
@_date: 2015-07-24 12:01:43
yeah miners never tried to double spend against a gambling site ... right? right? RIGHT?
@_date: 2015-07-17 19:09:26
Bitcoin doesn't work for micro transaction on chain
@_date: 2015-07-09 16:49:46
reasonable guesstimate
@_date: 2015-08-03 22:20:38
unlike you not everyone is lucky enough to get to sniff decentralized farts
@_date: 2015-08-19 10:09:33
you are clueless and you should feel bad
XT has lot of crap in it
@_date: 2015-08-15 13:23:05
I try stupid things from time to time but I'm not consistent like Ryan
@_date: 2015-08-12 07:07:31
a lot of brain farts from this Adrian
@_date: 2015-07-31 07:48:46
no problem, just increase again and again and get a big fat cluster server to run the blockchain, who cares about decentralization
@_date: 2015-07-23 09:17:48
eh, for some interpretation of smart...like my fridge
@_date: 2015-08-07 07:53:41
we shouldn't give them more incentives to 'spv mine'
@_date: 2015-07-23 10:21:21
OK, suggesting to use blockchain.info for anything just confirmed you don't know what you are taking about
@_date: 2015-08-11 08:39:56
it will always be a problem, the space in a block is not infinite but demand virtually is
@_date: 2015-08-29 14:41:19
that's true but Gavin and Mike don't care :(
@_date: 2015-07-29 07:24:05
it seems that the most senior people in the space agree with not increasing the block size for now. 
@_date: 2015-07-29 09:18:23
why would miners self limit themselves when many are spv mining
@_date: 2015-08-02 11:35:36
circular argument
the original spec IS the network running code, not your wishful thinking.
the code has 1 MB, if you want more you have to be reasonable and conservative within Bitcoin properties. you have to convince everyone not just doofus and circle
the only proposal making any sense is Sipa's
@_date: 2015-08-11 06:43:30
XT won't use the same blockchain, only share a common history
with 75% votes it is guaranteed to fork in two chains
@_date: 2015-08-15 09:09:13
XT wouldn't be newer, not for long anyway
@_date: 2015-08-18 09:50:31
isn't bitgo the one trying to patent multisignature?
now I remember, they had a bug that sent by mistake 85 Bitcoin as fee
looks like its employees and ex employees are a bit retarded
@_date: 2015-07-29 07:50:25
would it not be the people that did most of the work that allows for better network performance be most senior?
Gavin and Mike certainly did contribute something but competitively their are in kinder garden
@_date: 2015-07-23 10:55:56
uh uh, did Satoshi's white paper specify that?/
@_date: 2015-07-28 22:45:41
@_date: 2015-07-15 11:37:11
which competing efforts?
@_date: 2015-07-09 17:04:05
@_date: 2015-08-02 12:15:11
bip 102 is the 2mb? without miner vote? that's reckless
I don't think we need it, we are better off seeing what happens
I don't like any proposal but Sipa's is at least conservative
@_date: 2015-08-30 21:16:28
no trolling required to complain about your spam
@_date: 2015-08-18 15:12:20
if we keep increasing the limit dynamically so that all transaction fit what is the fucking purpose of the limit?
@_date: 2015-08-19 15:57:07
there there
@_date: 2015-07-25 14:57:27
don't *loose* your breath
@_date: 2015-07-29 07:24:34
not really a smart move given 1M is currently already too much, for now.
@_date: 2015-07-30 17:06:20
&lt;3 you!
@_date: 2015-07-09 17:03:22
 Gangsta but you have to trust the site, so maybe not, maybe RBF tools on command line
@_date: 2015-08-13 11:38:32
not giving much space the results
@_date: 2015-07-23 09:08:45
you may be can, not everyone will
@_date: 2015-07-20 10:51:19
what is the simplest way of trying mining on a cpu? can core still do it?
on Debian.
Low [chance]( to find a block but I want to try once in my life :$
@_date: 2015-07-30 10:34:20
what if less than 50% actually meant it when signaling for support for bigger blocks? do you even understand?
@_date: 2015-07-30 05:54:58
what business in their right mind would run something as risky as XT?
@_date: 2015-07-16 09:41:53
ironic, they only started working on lightning after Mike Hearn complained they weren't developing layer 2 tech

you forget that even if 75% signal XT doesn't mean that they will actually follow once it forks, see bip66. with bip 66 the threshold was 95 and not 75 yet over 40-50% signalled for it and then didn't reject the 5%

@_date: 2015-07-16 22:52:19
merchant mostly use third parties like Coinbase and bitpay.
Bitcoin users don't use Bitcoin because it's cheap but because nobody controls Bitcoin
holders: they don't care who uses it, they just want it to be worth a lot and be liquid
increasing the block size is not the primary way to scale, you can't really scale to wallmart levels without hub and spoke and lightning, there's lots of time before we have to increase it
@_date: 2015-08-16 07:29:55

fake forks ? what are those? I said fake votes
@_date: 2015-07-16 22:54:20
true but pushes the need for bigger blocks for a fair while
@_date: 2015-07-30 10:05:54
how do you know if 75% is supporting it or faking it?
@_date: 2015-07-30 15:01:55
no you don't get it, it waits 75% of votes, votes could easily be faked, heard of bip66?
@_date: 2015-07-10 15:41:36
lol, it downloads the list of servers from airbitz servers, may as well connect to their nodes 
and libbitcoin nodes are not very good

@_date: 2015-07-08 02:55:04
bitcoin works for me.
by the way, you can move to litecoin or XT if u want an alt with bigger blocks, what's stopping you? oh maybe it's a shit idea

you've been hearned
@_date: 2015-07-23 09:39:07
if I have say 27% of hashing power I can lie with no consequences. 
china has over 40% all together and if even 27% lie then 75% - 27% = 48% XT mining power at most will trigger the fork and over 51% of the total won't follow it.
don't forget that core could upgrade to the same block version number without the block size change.
 this may be a defensive strategy when XT is released as many see it as an attack on the network
@_date: 2015-07-09 13:27:45
he caused? wtf? proof or gtfo
@_date: 2015-07-09 13:31:16

@_date: 2015-07-30 15:02:18
@_date: 2015-07-23 09:13:59
just use better software, a number of wallet use dynamic fees, core for example
@_date: 2015-08-15 13:05:28
no not the oldest and anyhow not a good argument.

if you can afford the bandwidth and storage requirements Bitcoin core 0.11.0
@_date: 2015-07-24 15:51:13
running XT is risky either way, bugs aside, you have no idea once 75% signal a bigger block if they will follow through. it's enough that 26% of hashing rate lies and XT will only have at most 49% hashing power behind.
bip66 demonstrated that even with 95% hashing power signaling over 40% lied
XT has less future than dogecoin
@_date: 2015-07-17 20:11:33
very interesting. do you know if they have a minimum tx amount? 
this is an attack vector to Coinbase hot wallets by miners

why not both!
@_date: 2015-07-17 23:36:53
which is why the merchant will wait for confirmations, get insured or move on to channels
with or without rbf pretty much anything is an attack vector for zero conf. from relay fees to size to op return to cpfp and more
@_date: 2015-07-05 16:32:26
Gavin XT coin is an alt but latest core is not

@_date: 2015-07-15 11:31:15
make it spv and then we talk and stop downloading the list of nodes to connect to from your servers
@_date: 2015-07-14 09:55:49
you can start spv and switch post validation, spv mining is not part of Bitcoin core, they went out of their way to use it.
IMHO nobody is to blame and we learned a lot.

8 mb for chinese miners and no more than 2 for bitfury but not with XT either way, they said they are not interested in an altcoin
@_date: 2015-07-30 10:06:17
what if over 30% fake support?
@_date: 2015-07-30 11:19:05
incentive? have other miners waste their hashing power == more blocks for miners faking vote. if they have enough of the hashing power (75-51=24% or more) they are practically guaranteed success
F2Pool could do it and all Chinese miners could do it together.
 they already call XT an altcoin for better or worse.
at the end of the day many see XT as an attack on the network
@_date: 2015-07-21 15:36:05
you have a lot to go up still

full rbf has to come given the blocks will get fuller and fuller. CPFP will also need full rbf if you don't get the fee right the first time around unless you want to go cpfp recursively
@_date: 2015-07-24 09:50:44
pruning still means nodes have to download and validate everything, don't fool yourself
@_date: 2015-07-21 15:33:44
orphans are related to block size. blocks get eventually filled even if it is just the limit that gets increased ... ZOMG cheaper transactions let's fill it with opreturn and other shit...

too bad that's too slow for hardware wallets right now
@_date: 2015-07-23 09:04:07
this is true if you assume 75% signal the truth

I respect some butters but not jstolfi, when everything is supposedly wrong with Bitcoin you don't need to be consistent with the proposed fixes. you don't need to think about balance of security and decentralization vs scalability.
his fix is PayPal/IMF and we already have it.

@_date: 2015-07-14 09:17:16
the problem wasn't so much the 5%, it was the 40%+ that advertised support for bip66 and then followed the 5% by doing SPV mining.
this means that even if 75% advertise support for gavincoin you still don't know how many will follow suit

you mean like... litecoin? 
@_date: 2015-07-24 15:32:27
fine yes
 0.11 has worthwhile performance improvements
@_date: 2015-07-10 06:23:05
it can delay increases for years
@_date: 2015-07-09 14:01:08
yeah, just move to litecoin and stop telling lies ktxbye
@_date: 2015-07-13 08:45:59
you want inflation, go to dogecoin then!
@_date: 2015-07-24 12:50:02
not yet ?
@_date: 2015-07-20 12:24:11
too much work and I won't even ever find out if I have it setup wrong :)
@_date: 2015-07-10 06:20:24
offchain can be trustless which means you don't care as much for it being centralized, having one big node from a big miner is a problem.
@_date: 2015-07-08 03:05:50
CPU, band, storage, ram, globally minimum common denominator post fact
@_date: 2015-07-17 22:11:26
this just means full rbf + cpfp + estimate fee
blocks will be inevitably full
@_date: 2015-07-17 00:02:07

me too. he was running it on great infrastructure, not many can afford that although that's chump change for an attacker
@_date: 2015-07-05 14:24:21
is there any blockchain that doesn't validate with that version? it will validate fine with spv like security forcing you to wait 30+ confs
@_date: 2015-07-15 09:05:49
bigger blocks don't solve this, limiting mempool does
@_date: 2015-07-30 05:50:59
far more likely for lightning to be available before any increase to the max block size
@_date: 2015-08-18 17:37:41
that's not true, it could fork and then realize it doesn't have 75% or even &gt; 51%

litecoin already has bigger blocks I guess the market didn't care
@_date: 2015-07-08 22:38:52
just pay bigger fees, paying miners out of band is not the right mechanism

@_date: 2015-07-30 11:49:01
stolfi instead of proposing technical solutions why don't we make it so that you make a stolfichain like bobchain? I trust you as a sole miner to fix this mess
@_date: 2015-07-23 09:08:14
do you use litecoin because it has lower fees compared to Bitcoin? no? 
@_date: 2015-07-17 10:10:17
Luke only agreed that block space pressure provides an incentive to develop more efficient solutions. it has yet to be demonstrated how devs have conflicts of interest
@_date: 2015-07-17 19:38:31
you can't do double spends if the transaction is confirmed, there are less and less people accepting zero conf and those who do it know about the risks involved and are prepared to pay for it
people accepting zero confs are selling on credit, they know sooner or later someone won't pay but the extra business and better experience is worth it to them
and please, no propaganda from black list addresses Hearn, he is clearly calling doomsday for political reasons, even with the full blocks there was no cliff
@_date: 2015-07-14 21:20:37

@_date: 2015-07-18 14:36:19
any alert would help get double spends to miners that would have a great time enabling rbf, good luck with that
@_date: 2015-07-21 17:08:41
Bitcoin as intended
@_date: 2015-07-12 17:00:51
thank you for all contributions!
@_date: 2015-07-17 20:45:41
because it can't be realistically decreased, if it could be decreased we would not need the blockchain.
on the other hand not adopting rbf means you can't update fees and when you can it is very inefficient like cpfp and costly
why do you want to cripple Bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-07-29 07:06:51
said who? 
@_date: 2015-07-13 16:53:08
I know about the offices, why is the insurance fake?

oh so that explains why bitgo hired him, you want to hire people fitting well in the team
@_date: 2015-07-07 07:22:01
increasing the block size doesn't solve this issue IMHO

@_date: 2015-07-13 07:21:25
you are arguing with someone:

- against decentralization
- special agent at R/buttcoin
- against anti ddos measures
@_date: 2015-07-28 17:36:59

Gavin you always complained there was no proposal, now there area few and the most conservative one with most consensus including superset of miners whom are already too centralized is Sipa's. 
are you prepared to put down the XT release if this proposal gets a good iteration of fixes and consensus?
edit: bitfury said no more than 2MB

you are wrong AND rude
@_date: 2015-07-29 08:01:12
how else could you imagine moving miners and wallets devs butts?  if there is no problem there are no fixes.
in my humble opinion better some on and off pressure now than a sudden and constant pressure
@_date: 2015-07-29 21:55:14
a repo check-in by anyone without agreement would be reverted in no time, it would never get to Bitcoin.org. I wouldn't worry about Gavin or Greg from this point of view.
@_date: 2015-07-05 14:25:22

it doesn't fail to function
@_date: 2015-07-17 20:01:46
it requires zero conf in the same way it requires a smooth reversable transaction with credit cards

it appears to be at the top of altavista too! doomed!
@_date: 2015-07-07 23:16:39
lie again, Luke is not a cofounder, he is independent

opposite of what a buttcoiner thinks it's wrong?  how surprising!
@_date: 2015-07-16 20:30:13
zero conf being insecure is already priced in, full rbf doesn't reduce bitcoin utility, it makes it more efficient
@_date: 2015-07-16 20:34:41

51% is not a magic number. you can successfully attack it with 25%. remember that there's an intrinsic advantage for the largest miners as they would be more efficient (starting faster on the next block)
@_date: 2015-03-25 16:43:27
coinbase and blockchain.info have more but we don't see the same manipulation

miners don't always care that much about the currency, some convert it all and in altcoins is common for miner to use short term and individual tactics and jump on the next coin.
corruption would not exist if people were nice and people cared about not devaluating society, clearly some don't

@_date: 2015-02-13 15:39:10
they can still mitigate the risk with insurance and/or with third parties, there is no good reason to rely on something broken in first place.
credit cards are a good example, initially the fraud was not professional as it is today and they were happy with a piece of paper disconnected from the network.
now not so much and that's why chip and pin are taking over
