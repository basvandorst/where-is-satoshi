Nash is launching soon - March 31st. They will have game changing non custodial storage and exchange. I’m ditching my ledger nano S for it. 
@_date: 2019-03-29 15:17:15
The fundamental premise of Nash is a non custodial exchange. Technologies can only be proven by iterating, discovering problems and remediating them. 
They developed this technology for non custodial trading via state channels and development and improvement is something that never stops. 
They have engaged the best of the best security companies in the world (expect bank level security companies) to audit every corner of the software and remediate vulnerabilities. It’s an iterative and continuous process. It’s not going to be perfect from day one - and the terms and conditions highlight this. But you emphasis this so angrily. Terms and conditions highlight risk. There are risks with anything and everything, and the above risks are not just exclusive to Nash. 
You mention blockchain risks, they are highlighting risks that exist with blockchains. That’s an inherent risk that impacts blockchain (like how ethereum Classic was attacked). It’s a risk that exists, and it’s highlighted, but what do you expect Nash to do able that? How can they stop blockchain attacks? It has nothing to do with them. You make a pointless argument there because it has nothing to do with Nash. It is an inherent risk. 
With regards to regulatory risk, Nash it’s tackling it head on by gaining regulatory approval to operate in as many jurisdictions as possible. Since those T&amp;C were written they have obtained approval to operate in many major jurisdictions including in many states in the US and Europe. Few exchanges have gone to the lengths Nash has to be reg compliant. So again, what is your point?
Did you even read the term and conditions you pasted above. Doesnt appear you did. 
Finally, I would expect that vulnerabilities detected by community audits will also be addressed by Nash and fixed. I see it as a good thing. So once again, what is your point? 
Non custodial trading removes the trust component that is inherent with centralised exchanges. It is the best solution to the hacking problem. It’s not inconceivable the vulnerabilities will exist but they will be fixed. With this solution, no one person can just run away with everybody's funds. So it doesn’t change the fact that non custodial trading is superior to custodial trading. If you expect any solution to be 100% and guaranteed risk free from the first day then I’m sorry to say but you will only be disappointed with everything. 
Yelling and swearing and cutting and pasting terms and conditions does not make for a sound argument. It’s lazy. If you think that Nash is not the best solution available, please highlight a better one?

Nash launches in a week. It has fiat onramps and will be a superior user experience to even the best CEX. And it’s all the same trading pairs you expect to see from a CEX. Btc/USDC, btc/eth, eth/USDC. Basically all the btc, eth, USDC trading pairs. All of them. The long awaited DEX you speak of will be here and with the same level of liquidity expected from a CEX within months not years 
@_date: 2019-03-03 15:18:13
Nash launches on 31st of March and are delivering the holy grail of crypto exchanges. Non custodial trading, cross chain - so bitcoin/USDC, ETH/USDC, Btc/eth and the rest, high speed (high enough for high speed bot trading). Fiat on/off ramps (so you can ditch Coinbase) and much much more. Peer to peer payments to/from any crypto at the click of a button. Internet payments from any crypto to fiat at the click of a button, straight from your wallet. 
They are will be like Apple for crypto, launching an entire ecosystem of crypto products that are 100% non custodial and high performance and intuitive user experience. 
Just check out their website. When they launch they are going to wipe the floor with all the existing big centralised exchanges. 
Their mission was “to reach 1 billion users by 2030” which I thought couldn’t possibly happen (my first thought was, dream on guys), but when you see the ecosystem that’s about to go live, I think it might be do-able. They will be the Apple of crypto with this ecosystem and it’s all about to launch in 4 weeks.

Nash Exchange launches (community beta) on Sunday. The non custodial exchange we need so badly. No more compromises. This relentless hacking problem will not exist in six months when people see they can use Nash to do everything they do with coinbase and binance. If people keep using these centralised exchanges in six months then they really only have themselves to blame when they lose their funds to hacks.

I agree with this.

@_date: 2019-01-24 00:06:13
Yeah definitely agree it’s technologically possible. But none accept lightning at the moment. 
@_date: 2019-01-30 19:50:34
I do not have any open channels yet? My node is not showing on 1ML.com yet. Is there any way to identify my node yet?
@_date: 2019-01-31 20:20:34
What blockchain would it be tokenised on?
@_date: 2019-01-30 17:45:32
Well I guess that makes sense for now. But surely people aren’t going to run nodes at a loss forever. Given that I can send 100 usd via lightning for 0.001 cent fee, which is far less than the 0.2% that MasterCard charges, I would hope that in the long run fees would increase to cover costs and even enable some profit. Even at that rate I’m sure it will still be far cheaper than visa/MasterCard/PayPal. 
@_date: 2019-01-30 16:56:55
If you have lots of open channels and a decent balance in each channel then there is a greater likelihood a payment will be routed through your node, in which case, you will take a routing fee, the fee amount is decided by you when setting your node up. Obviously if it’s very high, you will not get used much. It’s not often a high fee. But I suspect people will start increasing them to at least cover the costs of running the node. 
@_date: 2019-01-28 09:36:58
The VPS service is pretty cheap (3.99 euro per month + 4.99 euro per month for windows) for a basic but decent system. It’s with Contabo. 
I think I’ll end up using it for other things like for work, so I hope it will come in handy but I expect in the coming months, for the purposes of long term operation of the lightning node, I will probably do exactly what you described above �� and sack off the VPS, unless it somehow becomes fantastically useful. 
@_date: 2019-01-06 18:18:04
This is driven by Bitfinex, by the exchange. Look at the prices. Manipulating the price pre down time. This isn’t real.

While many are cynical about the growth of btc (including me) and that the only people promoting it have a vested interest in seeing it succeed so they to can be wealthy, when you see a guy like this, while having a vested interest (30k btc) in seeing btc succeed, he doesn’t need it to happen to be successful or wealthy. He’s already a billionaire in his own right and doesn’t need to keep pushing it unless he truly does believe in it. If he really thought btc was pointless and worthless, he could throw away the private key to his 30k btc and would barely notice the chance in his wealth. He’s saying this because he believes it. I mean, he has an epic track record. Why would he risk it if he thought btc would fail. 
@_date: 2019-01-01 19:58:48

@_date: 2019-01-30 16:47:38
It’s great to see the community do it’s part to drive adoption. I guess the next step is to get businesses to accept bitcoin payments for every day goods. That will be the really hard part 
@_date: 2019-01-12 23:31:23

@_date: 2019-01-20 16:41:04
Yeah just joking jeez. Yep 35 years. Good guess. 
@_date: 2019-01-30 18:00:27
If the payment amount is larger than the balance in the channel then it can’t go via you. So more btc in the channel, enables you to handle larger transfers 
@_date: 2019-01-29 23:52:05
Ok cool. Will get it finished by tomorrow and open one up.

Hi. I have started a lightning node. The relevant bitcoin core wallet is encrypted - has a passphrase on it. 
When I open Eclair and try to open a channel I get the following error message:
“Error: Please enter the wallet passphrase with walletpassphrase first. (Code: -13)
Can anybody advise a fix for this?
Thank you 
@_date: 2019-01-28 09:16:46
Hmmm. So your sitting on fat stacks of 0.00072 US cents. Hmmm. So basically the node that routed 1 bitcoin of payments in one day probably made less than 1cent. Not exactly retirement income. Ah well. I’m still going to launch my lightning node today. Put my shoulder to the wheel in the interests of global adoption. 
@_date: 2019-01-30 17:49:58
Yep. The way it works is it’s a network of nodes with a open channels between individual nodes. And each open channel has a small balance of btc locked between them. With many nodes and many open channels any node should be able to connect with any other node via other nodes. And payments sent, the intermediate nodes collect a tiny fee. But the key is, open channels need to have a balance of btc locked between them.

Ok then. Please advise what he should do at this point in time. Specifically. Should he buy it 4 btc now. Later (if so when), or average in. When should he buy and how much? 
Given my advice was to buy 0.5 btc today, based on this, his portfolio would have increased. More than the opportunity cost of having fiat sitting in the bank earning 1% p.a.  Which means my advice would have resulted in an improvement over that position.
@_date: 2019-05-26 21:16:50
This advice aged poorly. I hope he decided to buy that 0.5 btc now. This is exactly why you average in.

In 1 year, the mining reward rates halves from 12.5 btc every 10 mins to 6.25 btc every 10 mins. This point, 1 year from the reduction of supply has basically been the start point to both of the last bull runs.

Privacy speed and security are three crucial features of a blockchain/currency. Bitcoin might not be as fast or as private as some other competitors buys it’s very secure and I suppose people who want to hold a few million usd in a crypto put a large premium on security.

Just buy the 4 btc over two weeks, maybe 0.5 every couple days. At least then, if there is a bit of a correction down to 6k in the coming days, you won’t be to far underwater. I think there’s more chance of a correction down, than a breakout to 10k. So just buy in over a couple weeks.
