Oh wow lots of triggered snowflakes in here because of Pepe lol ��
They think we're dumb but they get news from comedians. I try to debate them but they always run away ��

Iv seen "HODL" a few times so I know it's a meme and not a mistake. Anyone care to fill me in or point me in the right direction so I can see how this started?
*Edit: Never mind I figured it out

They have done a lot of work to the app sine I last used it. I think I have it backed up now. I'm going to go over everything and see if I can access it from my tablet. I have to read over the website the other guy gave me again. I think it's all going to work out because my phone is toast and every time it reboots I have a mini heart attack. Thanks for the help!!
