I am new to reddit but I have been following bitcoin for over 8 years, I actually paid someone $500 USD in bitcoin when bitcoin was under $1 USD or so. I could not figure out how to buy myself bitcoin, this haunts me to this day. I sent the guy the $500 via a wire transfer or something actually giving $500 usd to a teller at a bank with emailed instructions to the other person's account (using USD) - I am still not sure exactly how the guy got bitcoin for my $500 usd but he was happy and confirmed he received it.
Anyway over the years I have keep educating myself on bitcoin, going to conferences and research it everywhere I can. It has always amazed me how many in the bitcoin community seem to support banks (central or local) and generally fundamentally don't understand why bitcoin has actual value. If you think bitcoin and banks go together in my opinion you are truly missing the big picture.
Bitcoin is completely disruptive to the current banking system and that is a very good thing. My 2cents.

Put this in google "purchasing power of us dollar us bureau of labor statistics chart" and view images. This point is not even up for debate. Most will try and say wages have increased to offset the purchasing power losses but you can google that as well or you can just ask your friends if they are making significantly more then they were 10 years ago. Anyone over 35 will be answering NO. You can also ask them if their wages increased double digit percentages the past few year like their health insurance premiums (inflation shows up in items people NEED not just maybe want.....).

Yes I generally agree with this, but most people don't understand that. And those "banks" are far different than today's banks. Bottom line is banks are not friends of bitcoin.

Also Gold is up from roughly $600 in 2006, it peaked at $1850 or so in 2011. So during the crisis it did great. Compare Gold to S&amp;P 500 index from 2006 to end 2011 - gold was 300% higher. 
But I agree government money printing around the globe (first time EVER in history) has caused less confidence in Gold and it has lost some value recently BUT it is still above the S&amp;P 500 index if you started in 2006 (right at start of crisis).
Your comment about Gold not matching inflation is also very wrong. In 1969 a nicely loaded Chevy Camaro cost about $3,000. Gold was roughly $41 per ounce. It took 73 ounces of Gold to buy that car in 1969. Fast forward to 2010 when the Camaro was re-released (as a true muscle car). Fully loaded Camaro SS went for $40,000 out the door. Gold was roughly $1,200 per ounce in 2010 - so 34 ounces of GOLD bought you the same (essentially) car. How can you not see gold is an excellent hedge against inflation?
As a bonus in 1969 average household income was roughly $7k so it took 0.6% of income to buy 1 ounce of Gold. In 2010 average income was roughly $48.5k so it took (wait for it this part is great) 2.5% of income to buy 1 ounce of Gold.
The numbers have only got worse since 2010 but I like to use the Camaro example when I talk to people about this. This is not theory or opinion or philosophy. It's about being a slave or not.

The reason bitcoin exists is because banks no longer make loans like they did 30 years ago. Today they make loans from printed money, usually securitized by Wall Street. This has lead to the destruction of almost every fiat currency around the globe. 
Who will make loans? People and institutions with actual real money they are willing to risk/lend for an actual market rate return. Once the world gets back to this type of sound money lending everyone reading this and using fiat currencies will become less of a slave than they are today.

I don't know how to address the fact that you say "every major fiat currency in the world is doing just fine." That statement is simply not true and lacks understanding of the current global situation. If you or anyone else really believes that then you would have to believe bitcoin has no value because there is nothing wrong with the current system. That is simply not true.
Securitized loans are a disaster in any industry they reach from autos to medical to education to whatever. Sound money matters what we have today in fiat is not sound money.
Just because you can have unlimited crypto currencies does not mean they will all have value, in fact i agree many (most) should not. Bitcoin on the other hand seems to have value because people do not believe in paper money, they are tired of having inflation wipe away their purchasing power. It is a form of legal government sponsored theft and it has destroyed the middle class in most countries.
While I agree every new crypto that gains traction is in effect printing more crypto and weakening the benefits. I think eventually the market will see that and reject MOST but one or two may stand. If you don't believe in these fundamental points I don't see how you can see any value in bitcoin?

That was how banks used to make loans and that is the correct way to make loans (sort of). Today banks sell off loans (securitize) and are able to offer unlimited loans and then the Fed or other Central banks bailout the buyers of these bad loans. That is what happened in 2009. That is what is still happening in housing in the USA and many other countries.

You don't understand modern banking, banks HATE bitcoin. Governments hate bitcoin. Regulators hate bitcoin. Dictators HATE bitcoin. 
Banks make money because the Central banks have allowed EASY/FREE money for a decade. They have no skin in the game. Why do you think you can borrow at 0% for 7 years for a car loan? That makes no sense. The auto companies are finance companies they aren't car companies.
It's one thing to think bitcoin is a fad or worthless but if you believe bitcoins and the current system can coexist in my opinion I think you are missing the big picture.

I guess you missed 2009. If no one gets bailed out I 100% agree BUT that is not what happens in real life. In my opinion you don't understand why bitcoin has value or I don't believe in your view of why bitcoin has value - either or.
The fact that you don't understand gold further shows you don't understand money. I don't mean to be rude but fiat money has value because of force alone. Governments through central banks can print unlimited amounts of it. What do you think that does to the value of your labor (physical or intellectual)? You think there has been no inflation but you are wrong, you are using the wrong things to measure it. You are taking government numbers as FACT when they are not. If you don't think the purchasing power of the dollar or any fiat has decreased a great amount over the past 10, 20, 30 or 40 years nothing I can type here will convince you.
