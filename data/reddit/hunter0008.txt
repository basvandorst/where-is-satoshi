IRS likes consistency. They’re a more reasonable group than we give them credit for. As long as you can show that you’re making a good-faith and consistent effort then you can use either fifo or lifo. But it’s important that you stay consistent year over year.

Everyone here is correct. Your loss is a 2018 tax year event. It is reported on your tax return that you file by April 2019.

It’s brilliant by the state. I’m not a conspiracy theorist and don’t think it’s to track people. BUT, it’s brilliant in that, even if the state immediately converts to USD, now the taxpayer who paid by btc has a taxable gain. And guess who gets a cut of that gain? The state!!

Does the site have the ability to export gains/losses to be used for ones own tax return?

I’m having lots of clients having to sell to pay their taxes on 2017 gains. Not sure impact on market as a whole but has to have at least a small impact.

I haven’t signed up yet but does this program provide gain/loss statements for those who want to file their taxes?

Is this not a big deal? As far as I know, commodities are taxed differently than securities. Usually 60/40 long term vs short term capital gain regardless of how long you held. And only the summary of the gain is shown on return and not every transaction.
