We are still very early into the deployment of Bitcoin, so it is understandable that the price is volatile. As adoption spreads, and it is used more as a store of value and currency instead of a speculative commodity, the price will stabilize. The fixed supply means that I believe it will be a deflationary asset, always increasing in value.

I am curious how this will go for you if you do get it setup. I assume there are thousands of bots running much more complicated algorithms than you're planning, and probably AI's too. Since playing the volatility on short time spans is essentially a zero sum game (a loser for every winner), I assume someone like you or I would be on the losing side against these more advanced systems. I have to admit though, the large swings from day to day have looked tempting.
Edit: words.

I think I heard a talk where Andreas Antonopolous was explaining that miners are taking short positions as insurance against the scenario where Bitcoin falls and they can't pay the bills since they are paid in Bitcoin. It provides a sort of guaranteed minimum income, at the expense of somewhat limiting their upside potential.

This sounds so obvious but it is a really good point that never occurred to me. Could be used for an argument that if Bitcoin is gold 2.0, then it could also potentially replace fiat long term. Gains in the long term will be more like a 5%/year instead of 3x in two months, but the same logic applies.

Because alt coins are priced relative to Bitcoin.

Yes I was reading about that too, not sure how much truth to it, or how widespread. I bought from the biggest seller of the Nano S on Amazon and it came heat shrink packed and all seemed legit. Device works as advertised, so I assume all good.
Edit: By biggest seller, I mean seller with the most user comments.

The prices for both fluctuate on Amazon, and the sellers come and go, it's frustrating. Looking at this moment, the seller I bought from no longer seems to be on there, or are out of stock (seller 'Ledger Nano S'). The cheapest Nano S right now looks like $125, and the cheapest Trezor is $180 if you are OK with white. If you want the black Trezor from the 'official' seller, it looks like $220. This seems like a market ripe for price gouging. Why the OEMs don't sell their own products directly on Amazon is beyond me. Seems like a lost opportunity.

Congrats on being an early adopter and making a profit. That said, I think you will end up in the pile of early adopters who got out too early and did well but could have done so much better. Like that guy who sold his 21 coins at 10k/coin a couple weeks ago. I can't believe that was only a couple weeks ago...Bitcoin time bubble.
But I digress.
I am a late adopter and am optimistically hoping for 100k+/coin over the next few years. 
I don't think I'm among the majority here, but I don't think bitcoin would serve an economy well as a primary currency. Bitcoin would certainly be a deflationary currency in this case, with a severely restricted supply (+1%/yr?) and a growing economy, GDP and population chasing those limited coins. More and more goods and services represented by a fixed number of coins means an increasing value per coin, which is deflation. The problem with a deflationary currency is that people tend to want to horde it instead of spend or invest it, because they get richer by just hodling. This can lead to a deflationary spiral which can stagnate an economy, lead to unemployment, etc... This description some it up: 
I have yet to read any convincing arguments as to why this wouldn't happen if a cryptocurrency replaced a government producible fiat currency. That's not to say that the current fiat system is perfect (far from it), but it does get people spending and investing.
So, that said, I think the real value of Bitcoin is as a store of value; digital gold. It's better than gold in so many ways: easily and safely stored, easily divisible, easily purchased and sold online, easily transferrable around the world, extremely portable, well defined and limited supply. It it only volatile now because it is new. Once widely adopted (it is still very very early), it will be as stable as gold. Gold does have some intrinsic value as it's used in electronics, but that value is tiny compared to the value placed on it as a store of value and hedge against fiat currency inflation and possibility of fiat currency collapse. You mentioned it's use in jewellery as a major source of value, but I would argue that it is valued for jewellery mostly because it has a high perceived value as a store of wealth.
As you pointed out, there is $7T of gold in the market. I think Bitcoin could far surpass this, as it is so much better than gold for the reasons listed above.
I think 20-30 years before saturation of Bitcoin into the market is way too long in this technological age (note, there are 5 billion people with a cell phone, on a planet with 7 billion people).

After some research, I saw them as roughly equivalent, then went on Amazon to buy one a few weeks ago. Trezor was $180 and Ledger Nano S was $73. That decided it for me. Have been happy with my purchase.

My Visa denied coinbase purchases on three separate occasions. I had to confirm it was not fraudulent and resubmit the purchase each time. They claim it's for my protection but really it's for their own protection because they're on the hook for visa fraud.

I don't see hiw this could work. One of the main factors that gives Bitcoin it's value is its limited supply. How can a bank make it's own currency, claim it's pegged to the value of bitcoin, and pump out as much of it that it wants, inflating the supply? Why would anyone accept payment in XYZcoins in place of bitcoins under this scenario? Why would anyone deposit bitcoins into a bank, in the first place. It's not difficult to store safely, unlike gold bars or suitcases of cash. Maybe I'm missing something.
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:55:12
I will allow it.
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:30:42
I believe so yes.
@_date: 2017-12-15 05:58:25
Yes banks do this but they borrow dollars and lend dollars, which is different than borrowing Bitcoin and lending XYZcoin. By minting many multiples of XYZcoin, they are effectively devaluing it against Bitcoin. You can't just say it's worth the same as Bitcoin and expect everyone to believe you because you ran some advertisements.
Collateral for a loan doesn't work like that. You don't actually send them your Bitcoin if you want a loan. They would just have legal claim to it if you default on your loan.
So, I still don't see how fractional reserve banking would work with Bitcoin - LN or no LN.

I am curious why you hold Bitcoin if you have little confidence in it. 
- Customers have no idea how Visa works but that doesn't stop it becoming mainstream once people get used to the fundamental idea if paying with plastic. Same will happen with crypto.
- Volatility decreases as adoption increases.
- Healthy growth at this stage may be more people owning it. Not many are looking to spend it at this point. We will get there.
- Bitcoin had such a lead right now that I don't think it will be caught. Just my opinion.
- Governments cannot regulate crypto. They will get they're cut in taxes. Evade taxes at your peril.
- To the other poster, new cryptos may work better because they are less used. Also, Bitcoin is able to morph and integrate new ideas if it benefits the currency. It's not written in stone. 
My opinions. I'm a believer. We'll see how this all shakes out over time.

That's why the key is to invest only what you can afford to lose without losing any sleep, and hodl on for the rollercoaster ride. They can only make money from market manipulation if you react and panic sell. Long term hodl is the way.

Somebody correct me if I'm wrong, but you technically don't need to backup your public key because it can be derived from your private key. For that matter, you technically don't need to backup your private key either because it can be derived from the BIP39 words.

Bitcoin is volatile now because it is new and has a small market cap compared to what it will have when it is mainstream adopted. It will be more stable and more immune to price manipulation as it grows.

Very interesting. Although being an old analysis, it still seems to hold true, and I guess we are currently in a 'boring low' where the price stabilizes before the next run up. We may be looking at another few months of stagnating prices, but possibly a good time to get in.

High five brother same here. It was a rollercoaster of a day I admit, but nothing will make me sell now. I've put in what I can afford to lose, put it in cold storage and I'm hodling until the bitter (or sweet) end. A million or zero, let's find out which.

Bitcoin and gold can be lost but for the most part can't be destroyed.
Physical money needs to be replaced as it wears out, but not BTC.
It's quite simple, if 1% of BTC gets lost, the remaining coins get 1% more valuable. They don't get harder to use. As BTC gets more valuable, we will find it getting lost much less often.
@_date: 2017-12-04 06:08:03
I've been thinking about this a lot lately and have changed my mind on what I think Bitcoin will be. As a primary currency, I feel like it would be bad news economically due to the 'deflationary spiral' effect. 
Even once adopted mainstream and volatility goes away, it will continue to be deflationary as the supply is limited but economic output continues to grow.
So, I see BTC more as 'digital gold', or 'Millenial gold'. A store of value that will act as a hedge against the inflation of fiat currency, and will be almost guaranteed to increase in value over time due to the limited supply. It actually has many advantages over gold in that it is easier to store, the supply is totally predicable with an upper cap of 21 mil BTC, it's easy to transfer, secure, anonymous, etc. Sure, gold has some intrinsic value in that it is used in electronics and such, but this makes up only a very small percentage of the demand for gold. The vast majority of gold is used for jewellery (largely due to its perceived value I would argue), and as a store of wealth as a hedge against fiat currency inflation or collapse.
Open to any good arguments as to why I'm wrong. Working on FCC over here ;)
Edit: changed 'in' to 'on'

Keep in mind that annual gold production is increasing, while annual Bitcoin production will be decreasing. Also, banks and the Federal Reserve are producing US dollars out of thin air at a much higher rate than bitcoins are mined. So when we think of bitcoins in terms of US dollars, they most certainly will be deflationary.
