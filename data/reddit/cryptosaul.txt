Doubt that it will be the first or doubt that it will be crypto-friendly? And why?

There is NO Bittrex phone number for anything, this is definitely a scam. See this tweet by one of the Bittrex employees:

Great vid, well done!

Agreed, should have stayed

What are you even doing in the Bitcoin sub if you can't see the correlation between Ross and Bitcoin?

They look great, OP. Much much better than literally any other crypto merch I've seen (which usually have giant cringey slogans on the front). Good luck with sales

My apologies. Please let me know if you can see them on the front page now - one of my plugins was messing it up. Should be all good now :)

Because it's against their terms to impersonate someone?

Kind of - you can hold them there, but generally holding coins on an exchange for a long period of time is not recommended. Don't panic, but you should look into setting up a hardware wallet if you're looking to store btc for a while. Plenty of resources on reddit and youtube for you to learn :)

Can you find your wallet ADDRESS (this is your public key) anywhere?

Drive Uber, Strip (seriously).

Because he didn't have the balls to post it months ago (for fear of being wrong). Why does he have to wait until the end of the year if he's so smart and the 15k predictions were dumb?

I like how you had to wait a few days before the end of the year to post this...
