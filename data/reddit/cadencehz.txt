I don't think there's any official start but given we're driven by the marketing and the businesses start promoting it after Thanksgiving, by December most of us are in the holiday mood, setting up Christmas trees, starting Christmas shopping, etc.  Also I feel people are using their days off, maybe taking Fridays off, and business in general slows down a bit. Plus we have holiday parties at bars/restaurants in full swing.

Thank you for taking the time to write this.  I'm not familiar with Rootstock yet, but don't you think Ethereum is where smart contracts will thrive and grow?  I see a world where Bitcoin is the "petrol dollar" and Ethereum serves an entirely different purpose, for automation and communication; and there are a few others after the shake out, eg. Neo, Stellar Lumens.  And I would also think that companies like Overstock and Netflix come up with their own tokens to transfer value, but settle on Bitcoin.  Ownership/identities could be on Ethereum/Neo.

Memes are what we economists call a leading indicator. Charts will show that when a new ATH is reached, and larger the number of memes, the more likely a new ATH will be reached.  With a lack of memes at 18k, according to the charts, we are less likely to get a new ATH.

Gemini is terrific. I'm done with Coinbase and do not recommend them.  Took me repeated emails to "support" after they closed my account and held my ETH hostage. Luckily I already moved BTC out.  Their support is virtually NON EXISTENT.  They don't want you emailing or calling them.  They make it look like they have support but it's an automated knowledgebase of questions and answers  and they disabled their support@ email address. When I finally got a support request submitted I received an automated email stating not to reply as they disabled support I never got a human response in fact but eventually they fixed the issue stopping me from moving out my ETH.
Though I have never had to use Gemini's support so I can't speak to that.

I own a bar/restaurant that I was able to finance through making websites and apps, but I work more and have more stress than ever. But if Bitcoin hits even 4-5k I can cut way back on the website clients and semi-retire, or at least be able to put someone on payroll to take some of the load off me.

@_date: 2017-11-01 22:45:02
I don't know. What the guy above was talking about was claiming Bitcoin Cash after the last fork.  I don't think you can get gold yet. But if you get your private keys from your wallet with BTC, install Electrum Cash, import those keys, you'll have BCH amount equal to your BTC.  Then I moved it to Bittrex to sell it, though - and I know this won't be popular here - I sold my litecoin a few days ago to buy BCH.  I think there might be a world where 5-10 coins rule for store of value, micro transactions, smart contracts, dapps, and more.
Edit:  Someone also said in the things I read that after you do claim your BCH, move your bitcoin to a new wallet for security because you put the keys somewhere else.

If you consider that high then you don't know about what us small business owners pay for credit card fees.

You laugh but that is what's happening already.  I got on the internet and used BBS before the WWW and then on the WWW with Mosaic and no IE or AOL in the early 90's.  By the mid-late 90's the average person at least became aware of the WWW.  Late 90's, early 2000's the dot com bubble burst. It took Amazon 7 years to get their stock back to their ATH. Microsoft JUST got back to their ATH. Fast forward, early adopters got into BTC and maybe ETH in 2012-2014/15. I see this year and maybe next as the ICO bubbles, mass adoption and mainstream. And over the next 1-2 years a lot of ICO's will go the way of etoys, pets.com, etc. and BTC, ETH, Stellar, and others will be the Amazons, the eBays, etc.   Only time will tell for sure...

They offer their high volume customers really easy quick loans and then take a % of the daily card transactions at a high rate. Brilliant business move.  They offered $100k at 11% daily transactions.  Lower numbers are lower %.

This is great, thanks. I was thinking for the past couple weeks I would give my nephews bitcoin. Though I suppose they'll be thoroughly disappointed after getting Nexus tablets last year and night vision goggles the year before. But maybe someday the coins can pay for a year in college or partial.

I know some online sites already allow merchants to accept it. We've developed an app that is in alpha, soon beta, for accepting bitcoin via a tablet in the store or restaurant.  Ours is being designed for use also in the  service industry where we already have in-roads to launch beta testing. It will allow for tips and tracking of tips by employee. PM me if you're interested.

I do not use any iOS devices except for development and testing for clients. If I could make him stop using Apple, I would. My friends tease me about how much I hate Apple and most of them have switched.  This is just another reason that affirms my belief. But it's very unfortunate because coinbase is great and this will be detrimental to the growth of Bitcoin.

I'm new to this so forgive my lack of understanding, but I thought this was already possible through a few apps and websites?  I'm exploring bitcoin to see if any of my clients would be interested in being the first in our area to accept it, eg. bars, restaurants. I've read articles about a bar taking it in NYC and now a real estate company taking rent payments in CA.  If I wanted to suggest it to one of my clients, brick and mortar, it seems like there already exist a few options.  Any reason not to use them?

He once responded to a comment I made in a thread, but I guess this is pretty cool too.

We must increase the severeness of punishment for jaywalking!  Think of the children!  I've co-sponsored a bill to protect the children called Child Safe Streets. Vote YES on protecting our children in the streets.
