Maybe. It's a legal question that will not have a universal answer. Note however that police do not gain possession of coins when they gain possession of a device that *could* sign transactions if given a PIN code. For coins stored this way, the accused must also tell them the PIN - speech which might be protected by constitutional rights.
*edit:* And what if the device holds keys for signing a 2-4 multisig transaction? Should the other signatories wait to hear from the police for permission to move those coins?

I don't know about these technologies in particular, but if you want near 100% assurance that there will not be a reversal of the payment, you probably have to wait *days* for the transaction to clear, and even then, you are at the mercy of a central 3rd party to keep your account open and the balance honest.
With Bitcoin, 6 confirmations make the transaction nearly impossible to reverse, but 1 confirmation is also nearly impossible to reverse unless the attacker is very sophisticated and willing to throw a lot of resources at the fraud.  I think the odds are in your favor even if your content is priced at thousands of dollars.
The only [successful double-spends]( I've seen were against zero confirmation gambling.

If PGP is broken or the govt gains access to your recipient's private key, all bets are off. Even so, PGP still hides your communications from a large number of other potential attackers, and any message that's not signed becomes immediately suspect.
If today I get an info request from Kraken, but it's not encrypted with the public key I gave them, I'll notice an obvious red flag: Why are they suddenly sending unencrypted email(s) to me? Is this particular email really from Kraken or someone pretending to be Kraken?  Someone could steal Kraken's private key to trick me, but that's hopefully harder to do; it's *pretty good privacy*.

*"This key is not certified with a trusted signature!"* is a warning that you have not set a trust level for gavinandresen.asc.  The software cannot magically know if gavinandresen.asc was created by the real world guy we know as Gavin Andresen, so it's up to you to decide if that key really belongs to him. The best method is to meet the Gavin in person and exchange key fingerprints.  His key [is trusted by others]( so if you trust any of those keys, that would work too.  See [pgp web of trust](

@_date: 2016-06-09 16:05:32
companies like Coinbase and Circle will track where you send coins (as best they can). For privacy it's better to send the coins to another wallet before buying anything, especially anything that could cause the company to close the account and report 'suspicious activity' to the government.

Jason King claimed to run from from Miami to the BitPay office in San Francisco, more than 3,000 miles, and yet he was overweight on arrival.
3,200 miles in 150 days is &gt; than 20 miles every day for 5 months, not to mention that some days would be uphill the entire marathon. Assuming he rested a couple days each week - something that professional runners would need to do - then he ran back-to-back full marathons, no matter the weather, no matter injuries, no matter sunburns and heat exhaustion, no matter topography and road or trail conditions, multiple times per week for several months. Needless to say, Jason didn't do it. He lied.
"But that's just a publicity stunt", you might say. "He was raising awareness and we don't care if he exaggerated along the way." I'd go with you there if the rest of his record were not so damn shady. When bitcoiners threw money at him left and right, and NeutralityMentality asked how the money was used, [Jason King gave terrible non-answers]( It's clear to me that Jason was misusing some of the funds or was in way over his head and wouldn't ask for help, but Jason has a criminal past (IIRC) and his answers were evasive rather than, "Oh, I might have made a mistake. How can I do better?"
Eric, suppose we raise $10,000 to this Unsung project... how much of that money is under Jason's unsupervised, unaudited control?
@_date: 2016-06-09 19:24:00
Sure. That was the reason for my question. Not everyone will have a local copy of the blockchain lying around, or want to wait while some part of it is downloaded. What's the next best alternative for them?
@_date: 2016-06-09 19:18:08
Yes, I acknowledged (as an example) that downloading the blockchain (with a full node or not) would be most secure, especially within a VPS. When that's too much trouble - when you want to do a quick and easy lookup - what's the next most private method?
My use of *online* was to distinguish between local queries of a local blockchain vs. over-the-Internet queries to a blockchain someone else owns.
@_date: 2016-06-09 21:24:47
Yes, but expectation of privacy is not binary.

This is better because it forces anyone interested in the code to *think* about which fork they desire to use.   would give the false impression that there is one fork you don't need to think about. You can just use that one because, well, look at the URL!
With a better (IMO) distributed model,  would not exist either. At worst,  would exist only to host information on forks that are well maintained and generally trusted as kind of a "getting-started" for developers. It would not pretend to be the master fork, and if that confuses new developers, they should take the time to learn Git.
Of course, the general public would be confused by lack of an official, centralized repository of source code. But they should not be using  anyway. For binaries, we point them to bitcoin.org.
I'm kind of surprised the Bitcoin Core contributors have not already moved to the Linux model of source control hosting. It's very much in line with the ethos of Bitcoin.

Increased scalability and privacy for transactions would make Bitcoin far more useful. [This, in turn, will give the currency units more value](
I know developers are working on these hard problems, but I hope we see some progress soon. Everyone keeps making fun of the "Blockchain! Blockchain! Blockchain!" theme, but they also need to [listen to what these financial institutions are saying]( There are things they want to do that would absolutely crush Bitcoin in its current state, and of course, they can't start using a technology that leaks information they are legally required keep private.

Does this let me lock coins against my future self, e.g. can I allocate 1BTC to save for no less than 3 years?
Also, can I *prove* that those coins won't move for at least 3 years (without revealing the private key)?

I can fork  change a consensus rule, and run my NotBitcoinCore node today. Bitcoin's need of network consensus is not protected in this case by the existence of a repo hosted at /bitcoin/bitcoin, so our feared lack of consensus is already possible.
I think you would say, "Sure, it's *possible* for non conforming nodes to be developed and run, but the existence of  makes it *less probable*". I'm not convinced that this psudo-centralized GitHub hosting model protects us all that much, but I'm open to arguments that it does.

Question  *"Distributed ledger public or distributed ledgers private?"*
A1: *"Data Protection Act. Private."*
A2: *"Both. Private for now, private for the next 2-3-4 years at least. In the long run, when some of the new [privacy] technologies [are ready]... Bitcoin could potentially adopt [them] and become a viable solution further down the line. But that will be a long way off, so private for the short to medium term."* (This guy specifically mentioned Blockstream, zero-knowledge proofs, Zerocash, and homomorphic encryption earlier in the discussion.)

Dude. I've done that.
And actually, making and using paper wallets does require expertise. How many n00bs have lost coins because they didn't sweep the entire amount and they thought that the "change" would stay on the paper wallet?  How does one know that the paper wallet generator is safe? Standard advice is to save the HTML to an offline computer, then print to a printer that does not have a hard drive (because your neighborhood printer repair guy might look for copies of what you printed).
These details don't matter for small amounts of money, but you are acting like "make a paper wallet" is an easy solution to life savings sized bitcoin holdings. People can and do screw up in the process and the bitcoin network does not forgive.

Yeah, about that: Jason King claimed to run from Miami to the BitPay office in San Francisco, more than 3,200 miles, and yet he was overweight on arrival.
3,200 miles in 150 days is more than 20 miles every day for 5 months, not to mention that some days would be uphill the entire marathon. Assuming he rested a couple days each week - something that professional runners would need to do - then he ran back-to-back full marathons, no matter the weather, no matter injuries, no matter sunburns and heat exhaustion, no matter topography and road or trail conditions, multiple times per week for several months. Needless to say, Jason didn't do it. He lied.
The rest of his record is just as shady. When bitcoiners threw money at him left and right, and NeutralityMentality asked how the money was used, [Jason King gave terrible non-answers]( It's clear to me that Jason was misusing some of the funds or was in way over his head and wouldn't ask for help, but Jason has a criminal past (IIRC) and his answers were evasive rather than, "Oh, I might have made a mistake. How can I do better?"

Does "timestamping" imply that the timestamp is backed by very strong evidence it is true?
"Proof of existence" makes this idea explicit: We have evidence from a blockchain (strong enough to constitute proof) that this data existed.  A mere timestamp can sometimes be altered, but a "proof of existence" cannot.
Since *timestamp* can refer to "Lookie here! Our database record says '2015-02-03'", I think a new and less ambiguous term is warranted.
@_date: 2016-07-12 16:03:07
~~Twenty miles every day for 5 months is just barely humanly possible. Jason ran far less than that, although I don't know how much, probably less than 1/3rd.~~
On the money front, we have no idea where those donations were spent. Did he buy a hell of a lot of food for the poor? Yes, probably. Did he use all or even most of the donations as he said he would? Nobody but Jason knows. I think he wanted it that way because NeutralityMentality offered to help and Jason ignored that offer.
*edit*: Bruce, you could be right about the pace. Many people can and do walk 20 miles a day. Maybe that's what Jason did.

If I thought bitcoins can come into circulation without mining - without a coinbase transaction - we'd say I've made a mistake. In October 2010, when [nodes were confused by an overflow error]( they made the same kind of mistake. The bitcoins they thought existed had never been mined, and once nodes were fixed with proper range validation, transactions using these unmined bitcoins were dropped.

This doesn't directly answer your question, but most of us use wallets that query some 3rd party for balances. It would be better for those requests to say, "Hey, I'm interested in this neighborhood of addresses." rather than "What is the balance of 1HB5XMLmzFVj8ALj6mfBsbifRoD4miY36v?" (WikiLeaks donation address)
1. Is this how most wallets already communicate?
2. Are there changes to Bitcoin itself that would make it easier for SPV wallets to lookup balances while giving away less information on which addresses they care about?

Poor grammar in marketing materials is a red flag to somewhat intelligent/educated people. Scammers only want to deal with that segment of the population who won't pick up on red flags, so they deliberately place mistakes in the introduction as a filter.
If "this" doesn't bother "you", then you are "just" the kind of person they *want to* meet.
