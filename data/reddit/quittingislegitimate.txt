Very well put. Understand there is a reason that greed is called a deadly sin. 
I'm finding ways to talk about other things with my friends and family because this talk of money making is all-consuming. Greed. Death. Set boundaries. Don't check marketcap all the time.
I'm talking to myself here.

This is good for bitcoin

Lol I explain it to my wife and she likes the part where we have more money now.

You want loony. Before percentages I was trying to keep things divisible by 1,10,100,1000,10000. Then when I saw the price, multiplied my number, that's what I had! It was fun.... 
@_date: 2017-12-08 13:01:13
I've been pondering that for a little while. What percent would you say?
edit: I just put enough in to be over 1bcash... because... come on. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 07:33:54
Yes, I'm 0 for 4 on any monetary gains and I'm still up 14k. Don't do anything. I'd probably be around 25K if I had just stared at a wall. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 11:03:54
Quick come back thanks. I bought 10 lite coin when you said this and now I'm up $500.. so thank you!
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:40:53
Sorry 85% btc and eth. Once I had "won" with bitcoin/eth. I cut off 15% and threw mine to the alts. Here's my chart.
Open to suggestions!
@_date: 2017-12-04 03:34:31
When I bought bitcoin at 820 it went down to 180. That's a crash.
@_date: 2017-12-15 06:01:28
Well I hear you! I actually did that very early in the game to balance out at zero. What would be $140,000 now, but it's fine! I had peace of mind then and choose to have it now!
@_date: 2018-09-30 03:53:33
Almost like crypto amirite?
I updated it myself. Bought right at the bottom in a super hot area. The house is worth way more now... but I’m free.
@_date: 2018-09-30 01:18:24
I bought a house for 80k, I put down 16k. 5 years later it’s worth 300k and my mortgage was at 55k. I sold the house and had 240k in my bank account. I bought a house for 200k cash and now I have 40k in the bank... and I bought some bitcoin with it. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 01:27:29
So I wrote on your earlier post about the trash city in the Philippines and the people trying to improve their lives out of there.  
Now they don't have a bitcoin reception address. I'm willing to sell my one bitcoin and donate it and prove it to you. But I only have one and it's all I can afford since I bought back in 2014. 
If you are willing to donate that bitcoin to me once it is all proved that I sold mine and donated it, I'm happy to risk it. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:22:57
My portfolio is 85% btc, but I feel like it's yahoo, while google is looming in the alts. 
@_date: 2014-02-23 06:35:59
You mean 1605.21 bitcoins in business.

I've heard nerds go crazy over MOD which could get huge in January. I bought a few hundred worth to see what happens... nothing will catch up to bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 01:56:41
I bought a bitcoin at 780 and it went to 190. That would be a current "crash" going down to 2800 a coin... 9K is nothing.
Imagine 2800 a coin now... shoot. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 13:52:17
I'll help you out.  will get you information.
Also  which is essentially credit reporting for crypto...is having a presale in like 5 hours. Try to get in on it early. Don't be afraid to sell. If you make it big in any of these... put 20-30% in bit. It's the safest of these. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 02:24:58
I liked that part as well. I just sold some and am THRILLED. I didn't earn that money, and it was essentially won in a gamble. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 23:34:10
There is a city built out of a landfill in Manila, Philippines. I just worked with an organization that is trying to help the daily lives of the people in there. Any money would go a LONG way.
@_date: 2017-11-19 14:23:07
It'll be around 2K in less than 10 years.

I'm just watching tetherUSD closely during this. Interesting project really but at any moment they could just run with a shittonamoney.
@_date: 2017-11-30 02:22:21
I like the 50% rule. I sold some bitcoin at 10k to reduce my bitcoin dominant portfolio and doing cartwheels with what I have gained. This should indicate how poor I am, but I felt like I won a small lottery or the price is right. 
I'm as optimistic as anyone here, but greed is all consuming and will cloud your judgment. If you see the opportunity to cash out with major gains, take it and don't look back or count the money lost, only the money gained that you really didn't earn. 
Also quick side note: which alts are you in on?
@_date: 2017-11-17 06:58:18
I dumped my bcash at 1300... you can call me a hero. I'm ready.

just some quick advice for anyone about this [idiot](
@_date: 2018-02-04 13:10:07
I think pessimism is the best route with all of this. I disagree strongly, but let's go with this.
@_date: 2018-02-24 01:02:29
People make jokes, but there is some fear of collusion between the banks and government. Bank lobbyists are going to have a hand at trying to pass major regulation to ruin the unstoppable force of crypto. It would be temporary as this is global, but still I would hate to see America take a step back.

Maybe unpopular opinion. I don't like Trump, but having a conservative in the white house is good timing for cryptocurrency. Hillary was eating out of the banks hands and would have smashed it to the country's detriment. 
@_date: 2018-02-22 14:04:14
I have to bring myself back to this.... I bought in 2013 and didn't check for years. But now I've scattered in so many alts I check all the time.
That said, are you only in on bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-07-01 19:29:22
Can you not be here? Like unsubscribe to this channel? I don’t think it’s that difficult.
@_date: 2018-04-07 10:47:08
Hmmm yeah maybe get out. Bitcoin is very libertarian. Of which I’m ok with, but understandably some are not.

You can disagree with a smart person’s political views and not need to attack their intelligence.
