The Shamir's Secret Sharing output (2 of 3) is far superior to any kind of password encryption of private keys.
With BIP38 encrypted private keys you have 2 things to protect, the encrypted private key and the password. If you loose one you have lost your private key.
With 2 of 3 shares you can lose one share due to theft, flood, or fire, and still get to your private key.
The Mycelium Entropy can be configured to make 3 of 5, and many other combinations

Thanks. Improving Local Trader is next up.
You can set a PIN in settings. If enabled, then PIN is required for any operations involving modifying/signing with keys. This buys you time to grab your backup and move your funds elsewhere.
The PIN is however not used for encrypting your keys, it is there as a UI guard. A 6 digit PIN is trivial to brute force once you have file level access to the internal device storage, which requires root level access.
@_date: 2014-06-25 15:25:56
True that. However you cannot plug it directly into your printer and print out a paper wallet. 
You could of cause plug the camera into your computer and generate a paper wallet, but then you would have to trust your computer, and it wouldn't be as easy as: 1. plug in printer. 2. click print

Local Trader is very close to have its first 100 deals under its belt. There are more than 1000 traders world wide now. Granted, some of the trades have probably been between two traders backed by the same guy, but many have  been high value (higher than first anticipated) with fees paid. Have in mind that it has been around less than a week, and it takes time to gain traction.

Mycelium Local Trader has some similarities to LocalBitcoins, but there are some important differences.
You don't trust the Local Trader service with holding your BTC. Your coins are in your wallet, and only you control the private key.
There is no copy/pasting of Bitcoin addresses, the wallet is integrated with Local Trader giving both the buyer and seller a seamless trading experience. 
The fee is much lower, 0.2% of both sides of the deal. 
It is mobile, bring your wallet where ever you go. 
There is no username / password, authentication is done using Bitcoin message signing.
End-to-end encrypted real-time chat, not even the Local Trader server can read your chat messages.
Only works on android devices.

A master seed is just a seed for generating the BIP32 root. From that root you can create any hierarchy you like. If you import it into a wallet that generates a BIP44 hierarchy you get another set of accounts/addresses than if you import it into a wallet that generates a different hierarchy. So that's what I mean by hierarchy agnostic.

Mycelium has a minimalistic approach to address management. Most users never enabled expert mode and consequently only have one address. Once Mycelium gets to support full HD wallets this will no longer be an issue, as we can create a dedicated address in the hierarchy for Local Trader purposes without requiring an additional private key backup.
Right now you can manually activate/deactivate your sell orders. Automating that by location adds a lot of complexity that we would like to avoid, at least for now. The system is brand new and we need to see how it is being used.

When you encrypt a private key with a password you force yourself to securely store two things, and if you loose either you are screwed.
You would be much better off if you had three things, where any two reveal the secret while one reveals nothing. This is commonly called Shamir's Secret Sharing (look it up, it is really awesome tech).
When you split your secret like this you can loose any one share due to flood/fire/theft and still be able to get to your private key. 
Mycelium Entropy allows you to generate a private key like this, in a 3 of 2 sharing scheme, which beats any kind of password encrypted private key scheme.

The hardware (and software) of the device is going to be 100% open source.
For the software side you can download the sources, read it, modify it, and flash it onto the device. It is going to be as easy as 'clicking' it into flash mode and copying a file onto the USB stick.
For the hardware side: You can open it up and check the part number of the chip. You can even buy the off-the-shelf components, solder them together, and create your own.
The entropy is gathered from static RAM cells which contain 1 bit of entropy for every 20 RAM cells according to this paper: 
The device bases its randomness on 176k bits of static RAM which yields 176 * 1024 / 20 = 9011 bits of entropy. 128 bits are needed for creating a private key.
We have made our own analysis of the entropy of the chip we have chosen, it passes NIST tests and and agrees with the results of the paper.
However, as you said, you have seen too much "oh it's open source, so it must be secure". Well, open source is many times better than closed source. If you have any ideas for how we can better address your concerns please let us know.
In the end the device is a general entropy device and I hope that we will see many different firmwares that use it for other purposes in the cryptocurrency space.

The short answer:
Every trade session uses a different random key for encryption and message integrity.
The details:
The buyer and seller determine a shared secret using an Elliptic Curve variant of the Diffie-Hellman key exchange: 
To do this each party uses the public key of the peer and his own private key.
The secret is concatenated with the unique ID of the trade session and SHA-256 hashed to derive an AES key for encryption and a HMAC key for message integrity. This way the encryption key is different for every trade session started.
Here is the ECDH implementation:

I would rather connect the device to a printer than to a computer + printer. However, if you believe that your computer is safer, you can insert it there and still retrieve the JPG.

Today when people ask on the forums "how to create paper wallets?" the typical answer is to go to some web-site and run some javascript on your computer, generate a paper wallet, send over the network to your printer, and print it out.
With ME you remove many of the attack vectors using the above scheme. However you still have to trust the printer and the device we supply. 
We are actively discussing how we can improve on this. two things that have come up:

See my other comment. Plenty of free testnet coins. The current testnet is crucial.

Agree. I see 2 major problems:

Thanks for the post. Which tool are you using for making the peel graph?
@_date: 2014-06-25 21:08:07
From the project page: "Going forward we plan to add the option of generating master seeds for BIP32 HD wallets as a downloadable upgrade."
A single private key on a paper wallet gives you the option to offload a chunk of your coins to cold storage. The device allows you to print as many paper wallets as you like.

I happen to know from a top-level insider that code-wise they just need to push the button. This was back at the end of October 2014.

this has been the case for quite a while. Get used to it. 
@_date: 2015-01-07 18:39:45
Because there are all sorts of valuable crazy transactions on it that make it good for ... Testing!
Btw, if you need free testnet coins you can install mycelium for testnet on an android phone and 'buy' some for free by striking a deal with Virtual Trader.

Your sell orders are created with the fiat currency you have selected in the Mycelium settings.

294 devices? No. ApplePay is only available on iPhone6(+)
$199? No, that price includes a 2 year plan.

No. 
You can mathematically verify that your salt is part of the private key on the printout.
@_date: 2015-11-16 16:01:49
@_date: 2015-03-29 21:25:55
but even better: For Mycelium you should make a backup. The app always warns you to do it until you  have proven that your backup works. Backup on paper is the only thing you should trust. If you have no backup then you are screwed in case you lose your phone involuntarily (drop it in the ocean kind of event). This may happen any time, so you should prepare for it. Switching phone is just 'a mild version' of losing your phone.
For coinbase... i wouldn't know. I only store my coins where I know that I am in control of my private key.

The reason why is very simple: Trezor is more secure because once you have it, securing your bitcoin is easy.
You can argue that the same applies to electrum and armory, but I beg to differ. The upkeep of trezor is so simple and easy that nothing beates it... Except for maybe Bwallet ;-)
I don't think I can put it any simpler than this. 
@_date: 2015-02-15 11:56:52
Oh, how right you are.

Let me know if you can ship a high quality printed poster size version to europe. I'd pay good money for that.

The Bitcoin testnet is a separate network using a different blockchain. Except for a few parameters it acts and behaves like the Bitcoin mainnet: 
The main difference is that coins on the two networks are not interchangeable, and bitcoin addresses on the testnet don't start with a '1'. In many ways you can regard testnet as the first altcoin.
If your company builds a bitcoin service, say an exchange, I would definitely make sure to develop it using the testnet. Once it seems ready to go you would then flip a single parameter in the code to have it work on the mainnet.
In fact, if you give people access to a testnet version of your service, then they can try out a lot of your features without risking anything. If they like what they see they can move on to the real deal.

Another kind of Mycelium... 
The Bitcoin kind:
@_date: 2015-02-13 06:06:22
The thing is that Mycelium (the company) holds NO funds. Not even in escrow. 
@_date: 2015-02-11 22:24:28
2011 - 2012 I made a general purpose Java wallet API (BCCAPI) on top of which BitcoinSpinner was built, a popular Android wallet in that time. 2013 -2014 it evolved into Mycelium. 
These days I devote my time on doing real-time graph analysis of the blockchain. Lots of hard fun. 
@_date: 2015-02-12 08:16:53
The latter.
If you write software that allows people to 'be your own bank' then the end user has to act responsibly: If you lose your private key you lose your money.
From day one all the wallet software I have made has had the capability to let the user make a backup of their private keys. As far as I remember no user I have heard of lost coins due to software bugs. Otherwise, yes, some user have lost their coins due to carelessness after fair warning.

Great. I guess that was either the 2012 October London Bitcoin Conference or a Bitcoin meetup in SF.

If you have the testnet version of Mycelium on an Android you can 'buy' free testnet coins using the local trader feature by striking a deal with 'Virtual Trader'
@_date: 2015-02-11 18:15:55
IMO Mycelium was just hit by a broad automated filter that caught poetnital violators of their TOC and landed on a stort list that was approved by some random employee. 
App contains words "transaction" &amp; "fee" and is a free app -&gt;  put on list. 
Really, what would you do if you has to approve a gazillion apps a day. Google has no idea what Myceluim is. 
@_date: 2015-02-12 15:03:36
Interesting graph. Thanks for sharing.
The UTXO set size is a valuable metric when determining adoption. However, since many people these days use bitcoin banks everything gets a bit blurred.

... yet another 'opportunity' with no testnet support 
@_date: 2015-02-12 14:21:17
Me? I am just an old fart that has been around quite a while trying to make great solutions with this amazing technology. I usually keep a low profile, but have been speaking at several major Bitcoin conferences. On Bitcointalk I am Jan, here I am Jan Moller, in real life I am Jan Møller ;)
Unlike many people in this community I am not ashamed of who I am in real life.

If you are not in control of your bitcoin private keys yo do not have any bitcoins.

You mean Mycelium

The update has been on google play since december 31, but I guess you didn't install it from there.
I usually also upload the signed apk here: 
For some reason I forgot to do this for the last version.
Done now, and here is a direct link:

Subway in Moscow is using Mycelium for accepting bitcoin payments: 
Because it supports 164 currencies (including RUB), allows you to enter the price in fiat, and has support for read-only wallets it is perfect for accepting bitcoin payments for in-person payments.

If you are not the only one who has access to your private keys, then you do not have any bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-11-28 22:01:29
Coinbase is a Bitcoin bank. &lt;--- you do not control the private key.
If you are not the sole controller of your private keys you do not have any bitcoin.

If you have more than one address you can go into settings and enable Aggregated Mode. This way your balance will be the sum of your balances of all your active addresses. Also, your tx history will show the latest transactions of all your active addresses.
@_date: 2013-12-06 09:41:59
You can enable the PIN feature in settings to prevent someone from picking up your phone and spending your coins (or messing around with your keys) while you look the other way. 
You can keep your coins on paper and do cold storage spending (Works with standard SIPA keys, BIP38 encrypted keys, and Mycelium backup encrypted keys):

I am the developer of BitcoinSpinner. 
There was a bug fix in v0.8.1b related to this, so I suggest that you upgrade and see if it helps.
However, I believe that you have many many small inputs (been playing satoshi dice have you ;-)
Anyway, if this does not help send me your bitcoin address and I'll have a look.
@_date: 2013-12-06 09:35:54
On every backup PDF the last page contains a detailed description of how to decrypt the private keys. If Mycelium goes away the last page of the PDF lets you grab a developer and have him make some software that allows you to get to your funds. The PDF also has a link to the sources :-)

Paper wallets made easy: 
@_date: 2013-11-04 17:13:56
I am the BitcoinSpinner dev. The status of BitcoinSpinner is that it is well and alive, but I have stopped developing it. For the past 6 months I have been working full time on the Mycelium Bitcoin Wallet, which is soon to go into 1.0. Once that happens there will be a single update to BitcoinSpinner that encourages everyone to migrate with a one month notice. After that the old BitcoinSpinner server will be taken down.
Even when the BitcoinSpinner server is down you can still run the app , export your private key, and import it into another wallet. Of cause I think that Mycelium is a good choice, but you are free to choose anything you like.
