And this is pretty obvious to anyone who reads the article. He just talks about benefits which bitcoin offers, not saying it's a good investment, and most definitely not saying that it is better than gold or USD as the headline says.
@_date: 2018-01-18 01:06:08
It isn't, but it is a pretty gaping difference between the two which I thought was relevant here.

Just too many people who know one quote which Joseph Kennedy allegedly said and think that they are smarter than everyone around them...
I've *known* that bitcoin was going to crash soon for the last 5 years. Statements like that are silly. If you're so confident then put your money where your mouth is and get rich, since you alone can time the bitcoin market.

If I think what is based on faith and the masses? This dip? Because I've already said stuff to suggest otherwise. I'm talking about the near future of crypto.

I'm sorry for changing my account to something not linked with my irl identity, didn't realise ad hominem was a legit tactic, clearly I'm shilling for... Something... :)

Lol at people calling this a correction... That's just not what it is at all, and if it were it would be pretty hard to call it that now like 12 hours after it stopped falling.

100k BTC*
@_date: 2018-01-18 12:52:45
What? Why do you think it made me mad...? 
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:12:25
Wow well who didn't "know" that a crash was coming "soon"?
@_date: 2018-01-24 19:28:46
Bitcoin hit 20k like a month ago
@_date: 2018-01-17 23:07:02
If the masses lose faith in it then the value will be much less. Right now, if Bitcoin fucks it, I think that could happen. 
@_date: 2018-01-27 17:45:13
100k bitcoin*
@_date: 2018-01-24 13:51:24
More realistically he was paid to post that
@_date: 2018-01-27 16:29:32
Yeah, it had already doubled his net worth at that point. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 18:13:31
It can't hit zero, and it isn't a correction. It's the price dropping in response to new events. The idea of crypto price "correcting" is fundamentally flawed anyway since there is no *correct* price for any cryptocurrency I'm aware of. They have no real value; it is purely defined by the market and what people are willing to pay.
@_date: 2018-01-17 09:13:37
Lol my bad, corrected. It's too early in the morning okay
@_date: 2018-01-18 18:53:40
The rise of bitcoin was caused by greater demand. There is greater demand because people want to invest in it, not because they want to take advantage of its *real use cases*.
@_date: 2018-01-18 08:31:01
Too many people getting into crypto with no clue :) 
@_date: 2018-01-27 19:43:52
If you own your 400k house then I'd say you're pretty rich
@_date: 2018-01-24 13:54:16
It's like a month old yes. Old does not mean dated.
@_date: 2018-01-27 16:16:01
So he invested in a tech company and had 100k bitcoin* 4 years ago, which he said was about 20% of his net worth. Man was already rich, not just some dude
@_date: 2018-01-18 11:54:28
What does the age of my account have to do with anything then
@_date: 2018-01-17 23:04:12
Bitcoin doesn't have huge powerful organisations protecting its wealth like those other things
@_date: 2018-01-27 17:48:44
It is. Guessing he bought in around $100, held 100k BTC to 2014, and between then and now has sold another 60k. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 10:24:44
If bitcoin can't scale to demand (it can't) then your suggestion to increase demand to increase value won't work.
@_date: 2017-12-17 14:26:53
No it isn't, it's meter 
@_date: 2017-12-10 10:16:51
That article says that it did happen, just that it didn't actually crash the economy as is sometimes claimed. Read beyond the headline before linking.
@_date: 2017-12-10 10:23:04
It's bigger news than the variations of "bitcoin now worth $X!" which make the front page basically every day. Its value on the long run will be determined by its use as a currency (which is basically non-existent, but let's ignore that).
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:22:35
Yeah like if I had the money and the motivation to invest back then I'd have at least cashed out most of it at 500, if I ever made it that far. That's absolute best case in my fantasies.
@_date: 2018-02-17 02:05:13
She could probably be a lot more informative than that without losing interest.
