[Keepass]( has this to say:




By default: no. The Auto-Type method in KeePass 2.x works the same as the one in 1.x and consequently is not keylogger-safe.

Thanks, I was wondering about this.

I knew about the CPU's, but I heard unlocking a CPU doesn't always work because sometimes the 4th core was disabled on account of being faulty. That discrepancy prompted my question. Thanks again!

Orangered for you, it's back up. [Now we see what happens...](

I take it the unlocking procedure has at or close to a 100% success rate if you don't derp on the procedure? Thanks.

It's okay to start off like this guy did, but if you see the price continue to fluctuate right next to your order amount for maybe 15 minutes, try cancelling the order and raising your sell price. You'll move your coins slower, but you won't be selling them for less than other people think they're worth. If the price doesn't show any signs of rising to meet your new price, then by all means move it back down.
Admittedly, what the other guys did isn't the worst thing (for themselves) they could have done. They moved all their BTC for $19 and $20 a piece, respectively, where if they wanted to move their BTC as fast as possible, they could have sold all at once for as low as $17 per bitcoin on average, causing the market to suddenly spike down noticeably. On the upside, a higher percentage of traders would know that was a freak occurrence and quickly correct the market price.

Your title's a bit sensationalist, but I think curiosity is warranted. [Here's]( the forum thread I'll be checking for updates.

I went back and forth about stressing the fourth, I wanted to avoid people drawing out the third syllable.

I'd be a bit amused to see this bid sold exactly in full. I imagine whoever it is would eat their hat.
