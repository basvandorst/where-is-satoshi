Unbelievable. I've been away on business for the last few months, it's been hard for me to monitor such news. Even so, it's still my fault. Ouch......

It was created with an older verison of electrum. 2.8.3. I just updated it yesterday, but at that point it was too late. Why do you ask?

Thank you for the comforting words. You always think that this stuff can't happen to you, you know?

It seems most likely because I was using an older version of electrum which had a security vulnerability. The thing is, I was away on a business trip for a while, so I hadn't even used my laptop with electrum on it since October. 
So how could I have gotten hacked between october and january when I never used this laptop? If it was the vulnerability then I must have accessed some dodgy site before October, in which case why would a hacker wait 3 months to withdraw the coins?
Honestly, I really don't know.

I would really like to see this kind of exploit in action. Like, how would it get installed on your computer? Through running an executable, or simply by visiting a certain website that runs some JavaScript?

Yup! It always seems so unlikely that something might actually happen.

Interesting, I think with resetting the seed I should be OK.

Check to see 1 star reviews, some reviews I read gave evidence that the device has been tampered with.
