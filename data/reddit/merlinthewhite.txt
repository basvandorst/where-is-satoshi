That's the plan. When bitcoin hit 15000 I just used a coin to buy a little of every crypto.  I think I just picked a bad time to do it because everything was up pretty high that day.
I have no doubt I end up making a profit, but what will it be compared to that one BTC?

Ok now I feel a little silly for making putting most of my my savings into my mortgage.
still, im on track for getting my mortgage over in 7 years instead of 30. And as a youtuber i have basically zero job security so I think my house is the best investment. besides bitcoin :)
@_date: 2017-12-12 02:12:36
Just for shits and giggles I put $50 into every coin on bitfinex. Down $200 in 48 hours haha.

for a $250k loan that 4% is going to add up to $180k after 30 years though.

Yep I agree. Our freedom is more important than corporate freedom ��

Are you the YouTube guy
@_date: 2018-02-18 04:00:01
Oh yeah that's a typo. In my head I meant back up to ~20k.

Wow dude was only 21 or 22 when he did that. I bet he will get a few job offers in prison.
@_date: 2018-02-18 15:43:37
I don't mind paying 30% taxes on my 'free money' as much as giving away 30% of the money I worked for.

"But if you invest in my shitcoins I guarantee you will all be rich"
He used to be somewhat entertaining, like in a train wreck sort of way.. but I had to unfollow him after he started shilling some cringy zombie coin thing
@_date: 2018-02-18 03:13:11
Yeah this post got me wayyy to excited. Back up to 30k?! Right In Time to pay my taxes!

Something like "lol? I was just asking an honest question."
@_date: 2015-11-04 15:11:23
About 5 days ago I bought some coin for the first time in 2 years. Last bubble I missed because I used it to buy *stuff* a week before the bubble... Well this time I got lucky! I was able to purchase $500 the first day, but now I can only buy $50 a day wtf coinbase?!
@_date: 2017-05-25 15:16:11
Can anybody photoshop bitcoin onto his back?
@_date: 2015-11-04 15:07:34
Well thats an honest answer.
@_date: 2017-05-25 19:52:38
Ha thats a clever site. But counting the first one isn't quite fair... At $0.23/BTC you could buy 434 for $100. 
If we left that out it would be "only" 146 BTC worth "only" $350,400 for a $13,100 investment.
@_date: 2015-11-04 03:58:37
Im sad because after a long hiatus I decided to get some bitcoin. I bought it a few days ago @ $350 but my daily limit only allows for $50 a day. I wanted to buy $500 so now im sad :(
@_date: 2017-05-25 15:32:55
LOL back up $100 in 3 minutes
*The price in inversely proportional to my blood pressure right now. Can the market just make up its mind i got stuff to do today.

Should I move my few BTC to my electrum wallet just in case?
@_date: 2017-05-25 14:57:32
Two years ago I purchased 2 years worth of VPN service for 1 BTC. I could have bought 28 years worth now. Sweet. 
My college roommate can tell his kids 20 years from now how he bought a $2800 ounce of mushrooms online.
@_date: 2015-11-04 22:56:01
well its almost $150 in a day.. not exactly a common occurrence.
@_date: 2017-05-28 01:41:33
I sold at 2400, I'll buy back when everything is more stable. I'm in it to make money. Should have sold at 2800, 'lost' $4000 as I watched it fall 400 in an hour.
Kind of hate it how most people in this sub are telling ppl to buy at the peak or hold. It's bad advice financially. I think they only do it to try and 'fatten their own wallets' / keep money on bitcoin. 
I saw people buying $10, 20, 30k worth at 2400+ and people on the sub cheering them on.. if you want people to help bitcoin, don't encourage them to lose money. I mean I'm sure they will make money in the long run, but common buy low after the bubble bursts.

Setup a website where you 'consult' in areas like graphic design, programming, self help, spirituality, etc.. claim it on your taxes &lt;-most importantly

@_date: 2017-05-25 15:20:28
Yeh that happened to me also. I set it every 2 weeks buy a small amount my income. it stopped for a little 3 months ago but no problems since then.  BTW is coinbase down for everybody? I was going to move my coins to my Electrum wallet but I cant..
@_date: 2017-05-25 16:48:30
yeahhhhhh im losing $1k every $100 drop.
@_date: 2017-05-25 14:58:58
Yeah today or tomorrow is the peak.

Once it's steady even or slowly going up for a few weeks. No rush.

Now that you mention it, seems like its re-entering the atmosphere at the last stage there..
