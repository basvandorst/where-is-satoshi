Labor theory of value is false.
Mining costs could be at $2 million and bitcoin trading at $0.
The bitcoin community is so backward that it doesn't realize the cold war is over since 1989 and putin's communist party lost.

So you have already lost a couple of hundred. Now adding a couple of hundred will not remedy that, because $200 needs a 100% increase to yield $200.

I didn't choose the fiat system, but people voted for it. I think their reasoning was that by taxing the rich, they could get freebies.
However, it turns out that if you're intelligent, you can backfire the system against those voters, and actually use the fiat system to become rich.

I'm annoyed that Knuckleheads talk as if bitcoin is valuable.
If it was trading at 1 cent, it still wouldn't be a strong buy to me.

The visual difference between 100,000 and 10,000 on the chart is tiny. In reality it's astronomical.

Why would he, if he can't get his costs back in the market.
Everything begins with market demand, which is a matter of free choice of individuals, how much they want to bid.

That is because all of you are clueless about economics. "Mining theory" is over 100 years old and stems from the book Das Kapital.
The fact is, if market demand for bitcon is $1 per bitcoin, and mining cost is $10, then it won't get mined. And the whole thing is forgotten like beanie babies and pets dot com.

Bitcoin is a passing fad, which is noticeable even from 2017 to 2018 let alone fucking 100 years later.
Also "mining costs" have nothing to do with the price. You fell for Marx's labor theory of value.

Let's say you desperately need $1000. The only thing you have to sell is an object that took you $2000 to produce when you were young.
Don't you see that you could still sell it for $1000.
So just abandon this false "mining theory of value."

The whole point of bitcoin was to load up on some virtual asset when it was trading at 1 cent, by buying 100,000 coins for a grand.
Later on you sell to bagholders at 19000 and you have 1 billion cash on a paltry investment.
A bit immoral of course, because you provided no real product or service.

I've been watching President Drumpf telling me that Putler is amazing.
Debt doesn't exist, it only means that the U.S. owes you that your tax obligation of X dollars will be retired if you bring them X dollars.
