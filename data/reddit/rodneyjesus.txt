You're pretty young so here's a pro tip for life and business:
Do not ask for sympathy. Bitching about downvotes is not how you get buy in on a product.

Pro tip: anyone claiming to know when a dip or boom will happen is a liar. Your guess is as good as anyone's. History has shown these things happen, then they un-happen. But even that is dubious insight.

Yep, he did, because he responded and acknowledged it. You on the other hand, are wrong need to move on.

It's obnoxious but one advantage: In many other countries like Canada, server comes over to you with a card reader and you finalize the transaction on the spot, meaning you have to submit a tip pretty much under duress. It's uncomfortable especially if you don't want to tip for shitty service.
Tips are a touchy subject in America. But no one should feel pressured into paying X% more because that's what's expected of you.

Lol yeah just seemed funny

I disagree. We're talking about an unregulated market that's pretty much in the wild west stages of development.
You can't even trust bitcoin.com to be forthright about what you're buying.
There are dozens of exchanges, a flurry of alt coins, and a shit ton of misinformation. People worry about the legitimacy of what they're buying, their identity security, etc... 
It's not a super "inviting" endeavor. It's intimidating and obscure, and it's hard to know what info to trust.

A *bit* hyperbolic?
I think OP vastly underestimates the power of FOMO. If the value crashed to $500 today, most of these "young people" he's talking about would be gone, looking for another way to get rich quick.
