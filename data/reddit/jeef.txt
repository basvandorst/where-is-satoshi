The app is grabbing data from my server which is acting as the limiter. :) So your phone won't get black listed (nor will my server.) ;)

That's a brilliant idea. Once I'm out of work I'm making this happen.

Pretty sure $4-$5/box. :)

At the moment, US only -- Using the USPS flat rate boxes internationally is literally $20 more than domestic usage. Also packages take 6-10 days to arrive using that method.
If there was a cheap and relatively quick way to ship internationally I'd be 100% for it, but I have this fear that the cookies would take ten days to ship somewhere and not be as good as they should have been. :(

It keeps tossing a 500 Error on submission. D:

Not the intended behavior, thanks for pointing that out! I'd agree, back should just close the app. :) Thanks for pointing that out, I'll add that on the task list for the next release!

I'm grabbing latest price for BTC using MT.GOX and LTC using BTC-e. 
The data is updated every five minutes from those sites. :)

Thanks! :)

KiloWatts taking Bitcoin? Today is a good day!

Corny, I know. XD

Okay so I actually plan on open sourcing this on GitHub and laying out everything I did. I really think this would be helpful for lots of smaller merchants or home-grown shops to get into this market. :D Short version:
Front end is jQuery + Twitter Bootstrap (Because I suck at UI work)
Back end is PHP / Code Igniter / Postgres
Start to finish took me roughly 30 hours to complete. :)

Thanks! :D

Oooh, thanks! Just posted. :)

We're in a pretty safe situation (Wife and I) as we have several close friends living with us who all agreed to pitch in if push came to shove.
What I'd love to see is more small businesses or home-businesses spin up using Alt Coins as payment. I feel like that'll help the economy and community grow and give it more value. :)
If you ever decide to give the energy bars a go and need some tech help let me know! I'm the coder, the wife's the baker. ;)

1) Assumption was yes, people would post their own content to be sold more than once. And while they could pool together, buy something, then share it, they can only use that link once. 
2) I actually really dig that model of yours. It's like a BTC mass drop for files/content, or could even go into legit products and goods. If there was a bit more fanfare for that I'd dive into making it happen! 
@_date: 2013-03-04 11:16:08
Thank you. :D

I did a bunch of Googling around and saw that par for the course with a lot of online cookie shops was ~$20+ including shipping.
With the Priority Mail Flat Rate, we're paying ~$6/pkg, and ingredients for most batches in the past has come to ~$5-8 depending on the cookie.
The cool thing about this setup is that we are very independent, we think it's a cool idea, and we're quite flexible on everything as long as we aren't LOSING money, obviously. 
If we get a bunch of feedback that it IS too expensive, we'll crunch more numbers to see how we can lower the price point. I'd rather make less money but get more people spending more BTC/LTC than not. :)

"We're a small kitchen batching out home made cookies for all the good little crypto-currency boys and girls. :) 
We're also fairly flexible on everything so if you feel something could be improved or changed don't hesitate to ask!

lol no, I was filling out the entire form then clicking "Engage" :)
I can screen cap and PM you if you'd like.

I don't see how that would make it better. :)
