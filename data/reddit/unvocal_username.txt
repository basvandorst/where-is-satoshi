Not that 2 weeks is a short time period but it would last longer if the hash rate dropped. A 25% decrease would delay the adjustment by 25% too.
If that causes the price to drop it could cause more miners to shut down their asics, making the situation worse.
@_date: 2016-04-04 22:19:59
Personally I am not expecting a dip in hash rate but a 20-25% decrease is not a far fetched possibility.
A 20-25% decrease in hash rate means a 20-25% reduction in network transaction capacity. That could cause a lot of problems.

Very simple. Like most people I have only a very little percentage of my wealth in bitcoins. So if I wanted to purchase the car with bitcoins and if I really believed a bitcoin would be worth twice next month, I buy equal amount of bitcoins simultaneously when I pay for the car.
@_date: 2014-10-25 09:01:49
By re-buying same amount you're not betting more. You're re-buying equal amount so you keep your exposure to cryptocurrencies the same.

Good point. We saw this year that miners don't care about centralization too. 


If Bitcoin survives 25 years I think it would most probably be worth a lot more than what it is right now. So transaction fees would be a lot lower in bitcoins.

No. As mining becomes less profitable miners will stop mining and the difficulty will fall until it becomes profitable again. Transaction fees won't get affected as long as there is a mining reward. (~2140)

If we reduce the block size limit to 512k, would that make the node count increase? No, people would migrate to other coins/solutions and we would most definitely have less nodes.
Or, if the block size limit had been 512kb, would we be able to reach the current user and thus node count? No.
Limiting the block size to 1mb right now is/will be limiting Bitcoin user growth AND node count.

Having off chain solutions is not good for Bitcoin. The more the percentage of the off chain transactions is the more inflationary Bitcoin becomes. 
Take gold for example. Banks sell paper gold. That relieves the demand for gold, increasing it's supply artificially.
It's inevitable for Bitcoin to eventually become like gold but we shouldn't force the majority of the users to move to off chain solutions.
Users should be able to verify their holdings easily in a decentralized manner so that Bitcoin's artificial inflation doesn't go out of control.

That's probably correct but you're forgetting the supply side of it. The people who already hold bitcoins might have become a lot less likely to sell after segwit so that might have made a reduction in supply, pushing the price higher.

There are places where you can trade B2X coins. Go check the price to see how much support there is.

From the post:


@_date: 2017-10-28 06:49:49


No. There are at least 2 exchanges that offer S2X token trading. Go check [okex]( the prices are same with bitfinex.


With so much hash rate and major companies behind S2X, the only thing that can cause it's failure is the lack of user support. 
The fact that you are considering there may not be a S2X blockchain proves that even you as a SegWit2X supporter isn't sure that there's user support for Segwit2X.
I think you are either aware of the lack of community support or at least skeptical about it.


Counterparty risk is not a valid argument.
* There are already a lot of people who are taking the counterparty risk. There are traders who keep funds on exchanges all the time. Some people just don't care as much as you or they believe the risk is worth the potential profit.
* The counterparty risk goes both ways. People who buy SegWit1x are taking it too.
Again, market is the **ONLY** way to measure Economic Majority. Miners and companies do whatever the economic majority favors. It's clear how much the economic majority values the S2X token. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 07:35:07


Do you really believe it was a coincidence that miners activated SegWit right before the UASF date? Seriously?

The difference isn't that much. Prices start from 875 NZD on localbitcoins right now. Stamp is 850 NZD and finex is 856 NZD.

@_date: 2016-10-23 12:09:12
I make transactions daily on average and I don't think the level transaction fees are at right now is a big problem. But this isn't the only result.
Due to blocks being near full all the time, it is impossible for any potential service that has a lot of users to use Bitcoin.
This also pushes away potential new investors from getting in Bitcoin because it creates the perception that 'Bitcoin can't grow any more'.
@_date: 2016-10-29 14:22:09
Bitcoin ATMs are not comparable. They are not online exchanges their business model is different.
There are no online exchanges that have spreads even close to 1%. 
What you're confusing here is the **profit margins of exchanges**. **1%** is not the **profit margin** of localbitcoins.
They make 1% of everything that is exchanged on their website. They have very little costs per trade. 99% of the trades cost them literally almost nothing (costs them almost only the additional data and electricity cost caused by that trade.) 
Their **profit margin** is **probably** more like 95%. Do you understand why 1% is HUGE for an exchange?
Especially for an exchange like localbitcoins who doesn't even touch any fiat money?
If 1% was "razor thin", how would it be possible for exchanges like Bitstamp and Bitfinex to have 0.1 to 0.25% and still be profitable as fuck?
@_date: 2016-10-29 13:55:49

You could say the same about the darkweb markets.

I don't understand. I thought we were talking about Bitcoin.

If they want to turn some of their profits into bitcoins a good way would be offering decent discounts for Bitcoin payments.

Rather than SegWit not activating, what I'm afraid of is a fork or a reorg.
Imagine this scenario :
* A significant amount of hash rate (read Jihan) starts mining non-SW blocks before activation while at the same time shorting bitcoin
* Some miners ignore the non-SW blocks, there's a split in the network
* non-SW fork becomes longer and a reorg happens
A reorg would have a significant effect on the bitcoin price. The miners who initiated it could've made a double spend, reducing the credibility of bitcoin even more and increasing the price and adoption chances of BCC.
Would that be possible?

If everybody agrees then you can't prevent it. So that's the question really.

They could be planning to damage bitcoin and pump their own fork

How?

This argument is so ignorant I don't even know where to start.

You can't RBF unless you've flagged it as such while making the transaction. However you can do CFPF if Armory supports it and if you control the address the bitcoins were sent to.

What is SegWit2x? Does it even exist? Where's the code?
