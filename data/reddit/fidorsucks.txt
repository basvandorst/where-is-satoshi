Too late..
they deleted my account today...
WITHOUT saying anything to it...
"Your account is terminated"
Well at least they transfer my money to my other bank account...

HELL NO!!
Pls dont switch to FIDOR 
They freezed my Bank Account too with only 15k total Volume.
I only traded on Localbitcoins,bitstamp and bitcoin.de.
I literally couldn t believe it after my bank account got frozen 1 month ago.
I contacted them 9 times so far.
Wrote 8 Emails NO ANSWER!!
Called 2 times and
Always the same answer by some grumpy person: " We cant unfreeze your account
it gets checked by the legal department"
and NOTHING ELSE!
They dont tell me why it got freezed out of the blue...
Ridiculus 
Fidors customer support is the worst
and I DONT recommend Fidor to anyone!
Interface and layout is really nice but everything else is for the shitter
oh and Fidor if you read this contact me ASAP!!

They canceled my bank account too
Only traded localbitcoin bitstamp bitcoin.de
Account canceled cause they "detected" unregularities
WTF ever that means
Banks are banks NO exception
They all suck

I dont care if they support bitcoin.de and kraken.
They are still as shitty as every other bank out there.
(except their layout and interface
is really appealing)
Yes MAD!
Oh and to my other post.
Before I started trading I asked the FIDOR customer support if my account could be freezed when higher volumes from bitcoin.de and bitstamp are flowing through my fidor account and they CLEARLY wrote
 "NO we are happy for your trade volume
your account will not be freezed"
Then it got freezed 2 weeks later...
just ridiculus!!
