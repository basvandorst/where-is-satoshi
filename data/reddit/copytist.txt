Definitely worthwhile. I've done some work on Rein, and it's glorious.
Here's some of my thoughts on it:

So... holding money in the bank means I influence financial technology?
Please, let's be reasonable.

I don't gamble, or engage in illegal activity. So no. I don't get the craze.

So basically you're telling me it's a moneysink in every way.
Sounds about right.
@_date: 2017-07-29 23:02:17
Well, where would you suggest I start to learn how what I have said so far is wrong?

The problem with Bitcoin is that it doesn't have features. It's just another way to exchange value. And it's not legally protected, so if you get scammed, you have no recourse. Nor can you chargeback on it. Nor can you reliably buy stuff, because one minute it's at $2k USD, the next one it's at $2.5k.
It's just a massive liability overall.

You mean convenience.
The same applies to the PC hardware you use, your apartment, your phone, and your internet connection.

The only use I've ever had for Bitcoin is getting paid in it. Which is a massive hassle compared to getting paid fiat, but when you must, you must.
But the more I look at the way companies position themselves, the more I see it as just another bubble that's going to burst, especially since there's no real life use for it aside from... holding on to it in hopes of it growing.

Except cash is reliable, and widespread already. Also I don't have to pay insane amounts of it (in the long term) to trade it in the first place.
Why trade with an asset whose value is de facto unstable and unreliable, if not to gamble?

It's marketing - how much do you pay vs. how much do you bring in?
If you pay $50/mth to support BTC, and 50 people buy from you for a sum total of $1000, you've made $950 profit (minus other operation costs).
Obviously the numbers are probably different, but the principle is the same. If it brings in money, you do it. If it doesn't, you don't.
Edit: re: my use case, I freelance - BTC only is how some of my clients operate. If that weren't the case, I most likely wouldn't be using BTC in the first place.

Is there ANY business which doesn't throw its own costs at it's clients?
Because at the end of the day, you need money to operate. And not doing so is losing money.

Well, it's *something*. It opens options - it's more expensive, sure, however it's still better than them not accepting BTC.
I mean, my use of bitcoin is literally: get paid, convert to fiat, do further business.
