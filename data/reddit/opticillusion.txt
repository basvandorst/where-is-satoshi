You sound like a fucking idiot

You only need to look at your post history to work out you aren’t the sharpest pencil in the pack ✏️

Buy Ethereum and use that to transfer as it’s quicker and sell it on the Exchange you’re sending to back into Bitcoin, do a test transfer with a small amount first to check everything’s ok

Exactly like when an ICO is first released, there will be a massive sell off, look at the sell orders piling up on the order book

Haha I can’t wait to see the these buy orders get ripped to shreds
@_date: 2017-12-12 03:45:36
How’s this FUD? Do you have any brain cells?

Buy Orders mean nothing, as the price moves towards them a lot of them magically disappear 
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:33:19
Every little helps!

Not really as whales usually put them there to make people more bullish on the price, a lot of people would think exactly the same way as you and think they’re safe, I don’t even look at the order book anymore

Install Miner Block for Chrome, enable it and see if it picks any up
Post your results as I’m intrigued 
@_date: 2017-12-12 04:16:02
I told people to set stop orders in my original post, not that they wouldn’t work, the market continues trading while GDAX is down, so the price can end up totally different when it comes back online to what it was before it got taken offline 
@_date: 2017-12-12 04:11:40
Scroll down to the scheduled maintenance section and everything you need to know is there
@_date: 2017-12-12 03:47:52
So I shouldn’t remind anyone that maintenance is scheduled and just let them be locked out of GDAX with the price falling unable to do anything?
You might want to lay off the weed, sounding a bit paranoid to me

Nobody knows, I’ve read about 40 different peoples opinions from multiple sources tonight on what they think they price will do over the next few days and they’re all totally different
Pure guess work but I’m just going with my gut
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:08:13
I have, will drop much lower
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:39:43
Easiest way I find personally, although I do it from Coinbase is
Sell bitcoin for Euro on Coinbase
Transfer from Coinbase to a “Fire Personal” Account
Transfer from “Fire” to a “Revolut” Account
Then use Revolut to convert it back to GBP and transfer to my bank
If anyone knows of an easier way then please enlighten me 
@_date: 2017-11-25 13:51:38

I was being hopeful, law of attraction and all that ��
@_date: 2017-11-19 13:15:52
People say “You’re stupid if you don’t hold” but if you can see an incoming crash why wouldn’t you buy into an alt to save yourself the loss and buy back in cheaper, I’m just wondering if Bitfinex crashes will the BTC market crash too! People can’t get anything out so they are pretty screwed
@_date: 2017-11-25 13:32:26
Fuck the taxes, when you have corrupt politicians and multi billion dollar company’s dodging theirs then why the fuck should we pay ours 
@_date: 2017-11-16 13:33:17
No point trying to predict the market, it’s usually the total opposite of what you expect to happen that happens
@_date: 2017-11-19 13:23:54
Not necessarily, coins such as Ethereum and Monero have not be artificially raised by tether

I think most people go off GDAX prices?
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:54:08
Which is faster out of Eth, BTC and LTC for transferring?
@_date: 2017-11-16 13:29:09
Why even mention Bitcoin Cash, it’s not even worth acknowledging!
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:03:09
Excellent! I was trying to do the same with Stylish the other day but gave up in the end!
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:47:23
Sell sell sell, it looks like it’s about to correct big time
@_date: 2017-11-28 05:07:39
That was probably Bitfinex manipulating the price using Tether ��

The Jam Study
“If you’re not familiar with the original Jam Study, it’s here.  Basically, the study, which was conducted at upscale Bay-area supermarket Draeger’s Market by psychologists Sheena Iyengar and Mark Lepper, found that consumers were 10 times more likely to purchase jam on display when the number of jams available was reduced from 24 to 6. Less choice, more sales. More choice, fewer sales. Weird, huh?”

It’s nothing to do with hate and rivalry, it’s to do with the blatant open attack on Bitcoin, the bots controlling the upvotes and downvotes on posts, the hacking of people’s Reddit accounts to try and manipulate people into parting with their BTC

Put a piece of paper on the table infront of you, Spin round 5 times whilst clapping your hands and counting from 1 to 10, a code will appear on the paper, call it on your phone and they will send your bitcoins via text message

I would have maybe waited for it to correct first and bought in cheaper

Not Necessarily, look at Zimbabwe at the minute, they are paying double the standard price for Bitcoins because they can’t rely on the currency’s the government provides due to inflation etc

Not a scam at all, Coinbase offer an excellent service! I am also from the UK and have no problem withdrawing using a certain process
You have to withdraw using Euro into a Fire Account and then from Fire to Revolut, then convert back to GBP

“But if you can see” does not mean “I can see a crash incoming” 
Quick run down on the meaning of the word “if”
provided (that), providing (that), presuming (that), supposing (that), assuming (that)
And no I’m not worrying it’s just an open discussion as that what Reddit is for

Well if Tether can collapse like people are saying then it could cause the market to dip? Just a silly guess to be honest, just ignore me

I’m also wondering this, I have 7 nieces and nephews to cover though so I need a cheaper option than a Trezor, I was thinking maybe a wallet on a USB stick, anybody know of any solutions?
@_date: 2017-11-16 13:50:12
I’m thinking maybe a USB wallet with a sticker stuck on the outside with the date on and the amount of bitcoin on the wallet along with how much it was worth on the date of creating the wallet so it’s easy for them to type in the amount they have online and see how much it’s worth in the future 
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:02:26
Unfortunately not, Revolut is funny about accepting from Coinbase a lot of the time
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:25:57
Using them as nodes might be a good idea to help support the Bitcoin network, there wouldn’t be any money in it though
