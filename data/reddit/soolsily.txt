I agree, this is a concern every person should have. I believe eventually these concerns will be solved once these bots integrate into blockchain databases and we limit the ability of information they can gather on our trade while still working and doing their job.

Thank you!! I've been working day and night to try and make the website perfect! I'm still working on it! Any recommendations?

What do you all think about the bitcoin fork? Do you think bitcoin will continue to fork? And will everyone stick with the original bitcoin even though it has some issues or will the public move to one of the forks which solve some of the scalability?

Yep, learned a lot along the way. I'll collect myself &amp; re-attempt a ambitious project like this again when I've built up more capital to invest. Only 21 Y/O still got a life time to keep trying

Kid sells car invests in creating 2 buisnesses by hand, amazon screws one of his buisnesses. And he talks about the impact silicon vally has on banning advertising for crypto. Its a years progress broken down in a video that will hopefully spark some solutions for the problems we see with data beint collected by zuckerman.

Its more than just the ads, its algorythems. People get placed in boxes and the algorythems determan what is seen and isnt. Even indipendence journalists like Philip Defranco have talked about it. I think what we need is our persional information online to be secured in a blockchain database. Basicly any information google's algorethem aquires on us concerning persional information is put in our blockchain database. Ads cant be used to pay for targeted ads based on this informationm that would eliminate the bad while opening up the good who are willing to create and innovate.

Profit Trailer does have a strong team &amp; I did receive about the same percentage gain in the early stages of PT. But I do think they pulled the trigger a little too early on this 2.0 update. I hope they are able to connect PT 2.0 to a dynamic easy to use platform like Crypto Hopper &amp; build off indicators in a way that opens up to small developers to build off this platform. Crypto Hopper has solved these problems as of right now, and until PT 2.0 delivers a completed product I'd have to respectively disagree and say no though I'm optimistic.

I agree, not everyoje is a crypto genius and we shouldnt allow people to shill and take advantage of people. But im a programer and developer, ive never shilled a coin and im put in the same box as all these shills because i have crypto in my name. Even with the work and proof i have to back up my progress.

You lose the shitty ICO ads but you also lose the quality small indipendent developers. I think a better solution would be to shoot down bad ICOs with the full extent of the law but not over reacting on the whole industry.
