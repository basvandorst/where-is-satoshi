It’s not as cheap as you think.

You can’t use profit to pay the transaction fee. A 200 sat/byte fee will still take 200 sat/byte even if those satoshi are worth 10x as much in USD. If you want to time your transaction watch the mempool.

The production of oil based currencies like we have in Canada and Australia are more of an ecological drain than mining bitcoin. Oil based money can’t be made with renewables.

What is the utility of a bond? Or a share of a company that doesn’t pay dividends?

Mass loss in confidence in the market caused by:
Skyrocketing fees as people try to move coins to an exchange to sell,
Which they are trying to sell because of a huge and sudden drop in value.
Which was caused by a loss of confidence in coinbase and gdax as they rolled out bitcoin cash at the worst time, during a BTC difficulty adjustment.

We needed some pressure off to clear up the mempool. Low fees are your Christmas gift.

Using the tenX card will mean he won't be making on chain transactions for every day purchases.

Some pools will allow you to pay to get included in the next block they mine. Some do it for free like VIA BTC.

There is a difference between a seed and a passphrase. A 12 word sees an be used to recover your wallet. A passphrase is used to encrypt your wallet. You can recover a wallet with the seed+passphrase but not just the passphrase. However a wallet can be created with just a seed.

Your friends wern’t necessarily contributing hash power to Bitcoin anyway. Nicehash just pays in bitcoin but they could have been mining an alt.

I thought for a second you would have to sell to pay for medical expenses. Then I realized you were Canadian, where getting sick means an iPad for Christmas and not thousands in medical debt.

Are there any wallets for IOS that allow both custom fees and Segwit addresses?
@_date: 2017-12-23 05:07:50
Yes they can.
@_date: 2017-12-26 15:32:22
There is over 1mb of 300+sat per byte right now so if it is a time sensitive transaction somewhere above 300 sat/byte should be good.

Do not keep them on an exchange. If you think you will need to sell them with no time to waste then sell them now and get rid of the headache. An exchange can be hacked, become insolvent, decide to freeze trading just when you need to trade, etc.
Your private keys = your coins.
A lot of people are moving from Coinbase to Gemini for their reputation of being pro bitcoin.

The utility of a bitcoin is that it provides a secure peer to peer payment system.

The CBOE is going to start trading futures on Sunday. They are getting their hedge coins now and raising the price before shorting bitcoin.

There are probably some wallets out there programmed to match or be higher than the highest fee in the mempool. Meaning if there is one 1000+ sat/byte transaction in the mempool then that wallet will force you to use 1001 sat/byte even though it would be confirmed in the next block at 300sat/byte.
These developers need to get their shit together.

Honestly Bitcoin needs a short break out of the public eye so it can clear the mempool, give exchanges a chance to adopt Segwit, and let the lightning network get tested and rolled out.
I wouldn’t mind if we wen’t back to a stable $600 because once these improvements are in place it’s to the moon.

Coinbase doesn’t pay you anything. They place a sell order for you and someone else has to buy it. The buyer is paying you the $150.

We already have Segwit which effectively gets near2MB blocks. The problem is none of the big players are using it. You can help by using a Segwit wallet.

I have a low unconfirmed transaction, is there anyway to boost the fee on this transaction to clear it:
or is my funding stuck until the mempool works its way down to my 20 sat/byte transaction?
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:32:17
It’s funny now until you want to spend the paper wallets and you wonder why there are so many 1000sat/byte transactions in the mempool. GDAX.

If suddenly you decided that you didn’t believe in the idea behind bitcoin, why would you move your money to a similar crypto currency? 
@_date: 2017-12-23 19:31:21
You must be either keeping your coins on the exchange or transferring from GDAX, something us Canadians do not have the privilege of doing.

There is nothing stopping someone for selling BCH for USD and buying BTC with USD. Meaning BCH &lt;-&gt; BTC.

You should take the time to better understand the technology behind bitcoin. Most scams don't hold up under scrutiny. With bitcoin the idea becomes more sound the more you research.

The difficulty of mining adjusts up and down proportionate to the power put into mining. This was a block takes on average 10 minutes to mine and should always take 10 minutes.

Save them. They are a little piece of history now. Do not send any coins to them.
