Ahh thanks!

I just have a feeling they will not portray it in a good light and highlight the risks rather than the benefits.

Must’ve missed the news!

Who the hell is willing to buy 900 at $4300?
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:50:55
That buy wall is getting smaller and smaller!

My bad, thought you were he.

Ok, I️ kinda thought it had to be bots. The price just sat there at 7974.99 and 7975 and bounced back and forth.  I️ had a buy order in at like 7960 but as soon as I️ saw the buying pressure yanked out I️ cancelled it and watched the price fall to about 7930.  Seems to work the same way when the sell pressure gets yanked suddenly, price jumps up. Just trying to educate myself. Thanks!

Just gotta ask...you living in that Tesla? Not that there’s anything wrong with that. I’d live in it too if I️ had one!

20 years old, in Missouri, name fairly rare...hi son! 
My wisdom for you, it may be in a bubble, might crash tonight while you sleep....or, 10 years from now I get to spend it on my grandkids!  Nobody knows, but I do know this, we are part of something spectacular.  Now, if it crashes tomorrow, you and I will still talk about it 20 years from now, if it doesn’t, you and I will talk about it 20 years from now.  Point is, that beer in your hand knows as much about a bubble as everyone else! Btw, if it’s not a bubble, you might get some bitcoin when I ded.  Love ya, don’t drink too much, it’s a Tuesday.

Just WOW, that’s insane and scary af! Do any of the investors have any recourse?

Honestly...i don’t know.  Bought it for my son who was doing 3d modeling for school, then went another route after HS.  It’s really fancy for staring at gdax everyday!

8 hours later......still waiting on that sub 6k dip.  I guess that 6k mark will look like the 1k mark in the rear view before too long! I'll tell my grandkids, "I was there watching, the night she rolled past 6k like a train in the night and never slowed down."

Saw them Friday night in Nashville with Moon Taxi!

Crap, damn autocorrect!

I guess I'm thinking that if a miner pulls .1 BTC/month that's about $500/m or $6k per year.  If I bought the same amount in BTC (roughly .6 BTC) which would have the greater potential since each would increase as BTC increased. Just trying to wrap my head around it. Sorry for the newb question.

Trevor won't do shit, I guarantee it.
@_date: 2017-10-21 02:37:12
Man, it's been above 6k now for a while.  I told my self I'd sit here waiting for that sub 6k dip....still waiting!
