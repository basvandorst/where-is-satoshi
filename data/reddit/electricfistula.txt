If he doesn't have to do this, i.e. if he can get away with the 500-600k, then what's the point?  Your theory relies on him needing a way to construct plausible deniability around getting the money personally.  Either he needs to do this, in which case the 1,000 coin at a time lottery is not a great strategy (gee officer, I just got lucky and won 120 times in a row!) or he doesn't need to do this, in which case - why?

No, but it was a risk you accepted when you used the service.  If you're right that the exchanges you listed never lost people's money (which I'm not certain of) then why didn't why you use those services?  They didn't offer the returns or services you wanted and bitfinex did.  Fine.  But bitfinex had different risks, which you were, presumably, aware of when you used their service.  Hacking is one of those risks.

Were you unaware that bitcoin exchanges could be hacked?

Right... Right... I was just trying to accept stolen money as a joke, man!

Wouldn't he still have to launder the 119k other stolen bitcoins?

Yes.  And also, you don't have to buy a whole bitcoin but you could buy a fraction of one (which would be cheaper).
Keep in mind, one reason people think bitcoin may be a scam, is it is something like a Ponzi scheme.  That is, if your purpose is buying it in hopes that the prices will rise, imagine that everyone has that same purpose.  If that were the case, then bitcoin would only work so long as people kept anticipating that the price would continue to rise.  That means there would eventually be a problem where the prices start to rise, people will sell, and prices will enter an unrecoverable fall.
That said - there are other uses for bitcoin beyond speculation.  Just - be careful.  It's not a guaranteed thing and don't speculate with more money than you can afford to lose.

1.  There is no physical coin.  You could think of the bitcoin as being like a number assigned to you.
2.  [Bitcoin]( isn't a scam.  It has been a functional cryptocurrency for the past 7 or 8 years.  That said, the price of bitcoin is volatile and could change.  Just because it isn't a scam doesn't mean that it isn't possible for you to lose money with bitcoin.
