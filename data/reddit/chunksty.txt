I agree, 21M is arbitrary.  
This doesnt take into consideration that a single unit is divisible by .00000001 (satoshi), so really its just semantics if you want to say there are 21 million bitcoin or 21 quadrillion satoshi.  At some point a consensus can be reached via developers and we can further divide these units if needed to adjust for price.  So I agree that the scarcity is really a grand illusion.
But, what alternatives exist that could address this concern?
@_date: 2014-02-16 15:14:42
When ever dealing with aggregate data, you always have to beware of the outlier.  When Gox was processing BTC withdrawals, they had a 20% + premium.  When they stopped, they are at a 50% discount.  They are the outlier because they choose not to run their company in a normal fashion, and thus are irrational actors.
@_date: 2014-02-16 22:22:10
One alternative, Peercoin, mitigates this by having adjusted 1% inflation on Proof of Stake.  Meaning, the owner benefits by receiving additional units and we have some sort of P2P wealth creation.

This really hasn't been true since June 2013, when the market roughly became a 30/30/30/10 split and the top 3 shared 90 percent of trading volume.  I suspect Gox only kept a major share of the volume because of their BTC/USD premium (again caused by withdrawal delays on their end) which undoubtedly attracted people hoping to sell at arbitrage.  Again, since Gox and team made no effort to effectively communicate this to new users on their exchange, they caused irrational market behavior.
