More money gives you more security.. Some people don't have need for expensive things, but enjoy the security that shitload of money gives them. That security is in a form - freedom. Freedom to do whatever you want when ever you want. 
That whatever does not need to be lambo or new AMG, but it can be simple monday morning going fishing instead of rotting away in traffic in your brand new AMG on your way to the office.
