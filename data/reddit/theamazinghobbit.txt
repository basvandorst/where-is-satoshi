Looking at the past of BTC all time highs they were almost always followed by significant dips. Personally I'm waiting to buy more but it may never dip and just go up in price. Also I'll be trading back to Fiat for the weekend when Futures launch to just get a feel what the market is going to look like. I might just miss out on a couple hundred bucks but I like playing it safe.

Depending on the amount you're trying to transfer this could be totally normal. As other users already reported on this sub Coinbase is using cold storage and as a result they need more time to distibute a transaction.

If it was a Credit Card payment there is a very good chance that you can call your bank and report it as a fraudulent transaction. Usually credit card payments can be reversed pretty easily.

Your coins are lost if your private keys are compromised.
Edit* If you want to buy Bitcoin to store it securely take a look at hardware wallets like Trezor, etc.

Buy at Gdax;com but do NOT click on the first suggested google ad. (It's a scam ad)

Have you already completed all the steps to secure your account?

No one knows what the price will be in the future. Don't listen to anyone telling you otherwise - Only spend what you can lose.

Maybe people selling to buy presents for christmas or to not miss out n Black Friday deals..

Probably too many buy requests since someone sold A LOT of BTC. Crashed the site. Price was already recovering tho.

To which address was it sent?

How can you tell from a transaction that someone was hacked? This doesn't make sense at all.

Go to gdax(.)com (If you google it be careful to not click on the google ad link since that's a scam) and deposit your Coinbase funds. From there on on the left hand side press "Withdraw" and you should be able to enter your bank information.

Got to Blockchain(.)info and sign in. Then on the left side you should see "Buy &amp; Sell Bitcoin"

You never know if Bitcoin is falling to 0$ or going to 1.000.000$ tomorrow so there is no  period of time to wait for when buying Bitcoin.

That usually is true.
