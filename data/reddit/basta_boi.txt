If you've held since 2012, you should have some altcoins you can cash in too

On an exchange like coinbase, you're trusting them to keep it safe. They're holding onto it for you so that you can quickly sell it through their exchange, should that be something you want to do in the future. If you really want to make the coin yours, you put it on a hardware or paper wallet. Hardware wallets are the most secure way to store cryptocurrency because they have screens on themselves, which prevents anyone from getting a hold of your private keys through means such as a screen capture. While hardware wallets are the most secure way to store them, they can be pricey. A nano ledger s will probably cost you around $80 USD. With this in mind, if you don't have too much invested for a hardware wallet to be worth it, you could always do coinbase vault, which would make it take 48 hours for you to have access to your funds. If you decide not to do these things, I would at the very least, set up 2 factor authentication for any withdrawals on your coinbase account.

When it comes to wallets, the wallet itself is not the most important part. The seed is. Imagine a wallet as a door. If you don't have the keys (seed), you can't get into the address. You can still add more bitcoin through the address into the mail slot, but can't get anything out. For that you'd need the keys, or in the case of a nano ledger, the door pin code. If you lose the door (the wallet), you still have the keys and can use any other door. The doors are infinite because you can always get a new hardware wallet or paper wallet or something of some sort. The reason you want a hardware wallet however, is because the keys are generated on the wallet, so no one but you will ever see it but you. No one can see them being generated on your computer screen or anything else like that with a screen capture. That's why hardware wallets are so secure, because they generate seeds offline.

So basically, Kraken owns your coins currently, and has it stored in their own wallet, so you won't be getting anything else from them. They're currently promising to keep it safe for you so that you can quickly sell it through their exchange if you wanted to do that. This has been a problem in the past when exchanges have gotten hacked and had all of the coins stolen, which leads to the people who bought the coins, losing out. This is why most people withdraw the coins off of the exchanges, into their own personal wallets that they control. The only way to lose the coins would then be if you lose the wallet information, or shared the wallet information. 
The address Kraken wants you to give in order to withdraw the coins, is the address to another wallet. When you set up a wallet, you will be given the public address that people can then send coins to. The seed however, isn't something you should make public knowledge because then anyone with it could access your coin. You can withdraw the coins to any wallet, even someone's that isn't yours, so you always want to make sure you're sending to the correct address when withdrawing
As to where the coin exists, the answer to that is everywhere. The way the blockchain tech works is that every transaction of bitcoin and every movement is recorded. This record is then kept forever on all the hardware out there that makes up bitcoin's infrastructure. This also means that if some freak incident like a massive solar flare wiped out all of the computers on one side of the globe, the bitcoin records would be kept safe still on the other side of the globe that wasn't hit. This is also good for security of bitcoin because for someone to "hack" bitcoin and the blockchain technology itself, someone would have to hit every computer that's keeping track of the blockchain (or at least most of them).

The nano ledger is just a way to access the wallet. It still exists when you unplug, you just cannot access it yourself. You could however, still send coins to the wallet, you just wouldn't have a way to remove them, unless you used the private keys you generated at the start to gain access to the wallet on another device, which would defeat the whole purpose of the hardware wallet.

The algorithm that is bitcoin generates itself

They wouldn't be paying you 16%, you would have just bought the bitcoin before its value went up in this hypothetical situation

Right. If the price drops, you still payed that price you locked in once you clicked buy. There are other websites like this. The problem with this type of transaction is just that it takes a long time to complete and receive your bitcoin. That's why GDAX is a better platform to use if you already have money in its account

Watch this start a crazy crash in the price

I'm limited in my knowledge but I'll help how I can

If the value of bitcoin goes up 20% in 3 days, which could be the time it takes money to transfer into your GDAX account, then your 4% fee stopped you from missing out on 16% gains
@_date: 2017-11-02 07:36:41
It's already above it mate. Whatever tracker you're using is behind

$7015 right now. Reached around $7085 for a minute

If you're just going to hodl, not really

The fees are high on coinbase but the good thing about it is that while your money takes a while to transfer and for you to receive the bitcoin, prices are locked in right away. If you don't want their fees, you should use GDAX. It takes longer for the money to transfer into your GDAX account, but they only have a 0.25% fee for purchasing at market price. However, with how much the price has been climbing lately, it might just be worth it to suck it up and take coinbase's fee.

If anyone knew the answer to that question, they'd be rich already and not telling you the answer
@_date: 2018-02-22 06:27:51
If you're not going to use them, no you don't really, but since transaction fees are pretty low right now, you might as well

You better have hanging hooks on every side of that bad boy
