Hey, thanks for calling this a scam off he top of your head. Off the top of your head, see many monsters in your closet? You might be scamming me making your uneducated comments. What's your angle?
@_date: 2015-01-21 00:10:40
Luckily, I never released control of the software at any point. I even made them let me own the domain. They owned all the profits except for licensing fees but apparently, they ran out of money and just dipped.
I've been developing the software for ten years now and had never tried to license it precisely for this reason. So when I did license it, I made sure and covered all my bases. I own it outright, and no, not a feeling, there is no doubt I own it. These people did not pay me to write it, they simply paid for a license.
It's hosted and fully operational. I just figure if I can't do anything with it, why not try and do something with a community?
Maybe it can be put to good use...

Hey man, I'd love to see some math showing me differently. The math I did had me initially buying Bitcoins to cover some costs in the first few months. Otherwise, I would have set some bonuses. But at 2% rake, the bonuses would be about as attractive as being called a scammer.
@_date: 2015-01-21 01:35:51
Hmm, thanks! But the client is only Windows at this stage. There is an Android client being built, but that is still a ways away. I will make a note to test in MAC, but honestly have no idea when the guys can get to it.
@_date: 2015-01-21 00:47:50
We should actually discuss this. PM me an email address and we'll get in touch.
@_date: 2015-01-21 10:41:30
Hi, there is no exchange for chips, you play bitcoins at the table. The chips you see are pegged to the bitcoins.
@_date: 2015-01-21 01:03:35
Ok, to anyone who has written any software ever, releasing source code is always like giving away your child. But the p2p no rake thing is easy for me and donations can be implemented rather easily.
Would releasing the client code be a good start? With an engine API of course.
Edit: Forgot to ask you to sell me on it man. Sell me on it! PM me.
@_date: 2015-01-21 12:29:51
The best and quickest solution to that is to get an invitation to the site and have me approve you immediately you can then have the download. Otherwise I can attempt to get you the download in the next few hours?
@_date: 2015-01-21 00:28:06
Not US based or US related. Europe.
Actually not looking for investors. I think it's perfectly viable with just some elbow grease. 
Looking to generate discussions about how to generate traffic to it. Bonuses are really overrated. Need a college course to figure them out and usually by the time you get to collect them, they're worthless, or your account gets locked for some stupid reason.
Would be willing to look into if someone had the right ideas.
And no, I don't travel to those parts of the world. LOL
@_date: 2015-01-21 11:09:06
Sounds awesome but reddit will not go near poker unless it's free. So no ads of any kind.
The shameless plug is not what I had in mind, I was thinking more of finding enthusiastic people to work with and get the software utilized in any way. Preferrably monetizing it of course.
@_date: 2015-01-20 23:36:42
I made a new comment where I basically answer our question. There, it's public now.
@_date: 2015-01-21 00:48:28
There is a lot of code, I would not be against letting you peek here and there... PM me and we'll talk.
@_date: 2015-01-21 00:43:23
Hi Johnny, no, not a marketer. And you are most certainly correct that I should not be hired as a public relations guy, ever. 
Running an executable depends a lot on how prepared you are. I did not post this on "poker for idiots" sub-reddit. This is Bitcoin. I expect people here to be smarter than your average Joe.
I would certainly appreciate your observations if you elaborated and actually gave me something to work with.
Please, help me out here and tell me where you actually see faults?
And I listed the url because several people were asking for it. As it stands, unless I authorize the invitations, nobody can download the software. So it is safe to discuss?
@_date: 2015-01-21 11:19:36
I can appreciate that. You can, if you'd like, test the software and if you find anything, anything at all, think of the damage inflicted on this thread alone where the site's reputatin can be runed forever.
Not trying to be an asshole, but seriously, it is a way to make sure.
@_date: 2015-01-20 23:36:06
Maybe we should look at uniting them?
@_date: 2015-01-21 00:00:15
@_date: 2015-01-21 00:46:08
BTW, avoiding scams is part of the reason I insisted on making it an immediate withdrawal. We have no buttons to push to authorize a withdrawal. If the coins are in your account, they are withdraw-able without anyone's permission.
Come in, make deposit, play, leaving? take your coins with you, please don't leave them here.
@_date: 2015-01-21 11:16:26
Would you be willing to help with the foot work and a share of whatever profits there are? We could sign a mandate and contract specifically for this.

@_date: 2015-01-21 00:29:07
Anything is possible if the site was generating traffic. At some point you have to stop developing and monetizing. 
@_date: 2015-01-21 01:44:28
Hey thanks man, tell me more. I see it difficult to sell advertising on something like this. But some guy was talking about just plain tipping or contributions.
Looks like we're on to something here.
@_date: 2015-01-20 23:43:46
about trying to control the multiple accounts.
Also, once you download, the software will demand a deposit before it will show you the tables. Since you can withdraw your money immediately, I didn't object because it makes no sense to have people just lurking, I think.
@_date: 2015-01-21 11:11:36
Exactly! I need help with marketing and obtaining players.
@_date: 2015-01-20 23:37:06
Ok, I just didn't want to come off as a marketer...
@_date: 2015-01-21 18:21:00
Of course I would not be against selling a copy with source. What do you have in mind?
@_date: 2015-01-20 23:42:19
What I need, what I want is to form a community poker site that everyone can enjoy. The site, as it sits, charges 2% rake and has no bonuses or anything. It has automatic and immediate withdraws.
@_date: 2015-01-20 23:39:27
It is not browser based at all. Sessions are controlled by the client server written in C. And the bitcoins go to an online wallet now. The system does not hold bitcoins nor are they hot wallets.
They are simple payments each way in bitcoins. The site generates a new address for each deposit and ships it off to the online wallet, then upon request, it sends a payment for the amount in the player balance. I think it charges a small fee for the withdrawal, last I looked, it was worth about 3 cents? I could look into it if needed.
Player is asked to set a pin number on first deposit, this allows the player to ask for a deposit to any wallet he likes, but he needs the pin number to effect a withdrawal.
@_date: 2015-01-21 15:25:45
I have a team in place that can do all this. Other issues have stopped me from continuing development for now.
@_date: 2015-01-20 23:34:34
Hi, it's written in C, Delphi, and PHP for backend. And yes, fully working accepting and paying in Bitcoins.
@_date: 2015-01-21 00:52:05
That is an angle that I of course would not have thought of. LOL. And this is the help I am looking for. The problem seems to be that a straight bitcoin site cannot just advertise anywhere, I think this is where the operators failed and bit their own asses.
@_date: 2015-01-21 01:55:44
What do you mean by join their efforts? 
I see their stuff is written in Python. Seems a little too heavy for very large loads. I would be worried about it handling large loads.
@_date: 2015-01-21 11:04:48
Interested if you can swing a meeting? Gauge their interest?
@_date: 2015-01-21 14:36:01
Yeah, I'm not the least bit worried about an NDA at this point. Would seem to me that they would be more interested in confidentiality than I could be.
So yes, provide them with whatever is needed.
As well, you can tell them that the system also may serve as a Zynga type poker site with facebook login and all the particulars of a site like that.
@_date: 2015-01-21 00:01:19
I need help with mostly marketing and getting people to play at the site. People and word of mouth and all that stuff. Ideas, how can we join forces and make this work?
@_date: 2015-01-21 00:21:08
I would not download BritneySpears.nudes.jpg.vbs.scr.
But I would also not go around accusing people of being hackers without any proof. I'm not asking for a pass. By all means, test the software. Run it ragged. If you find anything suspicious, then I would deserve the burn.
BTW, I would also not be downloading random software to the machine I store my bitcoins in. I'm hoping people are learning or taking the time to keep their bitcoins safe.
Edit: added a 'g' to accusin
@_date: 2015-01-21 11:14:39
Discussing this very thing with some knowlegable folk, care to join in the fun? Maybe we should open a post for this and openly discuss?
@_date: 2015-01-21 00:56:51
Agreed, and thanks! Any ideas on how to get around these concerns?
Nothing you install or run on your computer is 100% safe. But experience has shown me that download software for gaming is much better than browser based. Especially for real money and serious play.
Every large site has tried flash at some point and failed. Download seems to work best historically. There is always a certain degree of trust that must be assumed when downloading software.
@_date: 2015-01-21 11:49:23
Keep me updated please.
@_date: 2015-01-21 11:10:46
No, the rake is collected at the end of each round. From the winner's pot, just like in any other poker site.
@_date: 2015-01-21 15:25:00
Both instances are possible. The way it is setup now, players would pay with bitcoin, cc, or facebook coins and never be able to cash out. We even have a RPG aspect to the game with rankings and armies and all based on poker tourneys and ring games.
There is a lot to see. Ten years worth of development. 
Will have an android client this year. It can be ported to IOS with some work as well.
@_date: 2015-01-21 00:33:50
I really would prefer not to take a dreamer's money and then have him crash and burn. This is a very tough industry and poker sites are a dime a dozen. I think this software can actually become a part of the industry on its own without taking investor cash.
With enough traffic, it can be a pretty nice site. I want help in getting traffic to it and am willing to make deals on the rake to make it work. If we can get a community type thing going, all the better.
