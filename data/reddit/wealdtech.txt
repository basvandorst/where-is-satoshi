Smart contracts are just as smart as any other piece of code.  It would be interesting to consider if there is some way of translating smart contract code in to a native language document that makes sense to legal people. Too hard to do in the general case but then that's an incentive for people to write smart contracts that are clean enough that they are easily translatable and understandable.

There are a lot of regulators out there.  We only need for a few of them to bring Bitcoin in to the fold and the others will tag along.

MyEtherWallet doesn't store your keys remotely, so everything you need to move to another wallet program is already sitting on your hard drive.

Years from now when Dogecoin is the last coin standing we'll all look back and wish we'd bought some.

Not entirely sure what point this article is trying to make.  Excerpts like "Altcoins are more vulnerable to a 51% attack which is not a real threat to bitcoin" and "He is now developing two algorithms to predict trend of bitcoin price" suggest that the author, or those quoted by the author, aren't sure of their subject matter.

There is always room in the market for more than one of anything.  First mover brings a lot of advantages: for many "Bitcoin" is synonymous with "cryptocurrency".  Not that Bitcoin is the first cryptocurrency, but it's the first that gained any real traction.
I think that funds will move in and out of Bitcoin the same way they move in and out of gold: when people are fearful they will use it as a store of value and when they're greedy they will spend it in the hunt for quick profits.

What attack are you thinking that the above setup would protect you from?  The first time that you need to use your private keys they're going to be decrypted and vulnerable, and going through such a visible process on an otherwise inert PC is going to be relatively easy to spot.
Unless you airgap the PC, of course, but then you may as well just put your private key in an old sock at the back of your wardrobe.
