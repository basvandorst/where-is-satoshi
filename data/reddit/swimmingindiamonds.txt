Yes. He did delete his posts, but someone had quoted him... kind of crazy that after all that he was brought down with a Google search.

Let's not exaggerate here, shall we? 
You claim to own a "tech company" not an investment firm. You either own it or just work in "corporate upper management" but anyway... By your own admission you were stockbroker for only a brief time. You also worked as a bartender and in school office district and for Amnesty International and also was "a recruiter for many years, and working in HR" so at tender age of 32 I wonder how many years you really worked in financial companies to say you did "most of your life" as you say. That's not including your career as a professional photographer, a Youtube celebrity, and a porn actor.
A month ago your biggest financial achievement was managing to get out of debt and you are still "working on your first million" though aren't most people on Reddit? Yet you answered "millionaire of Reddit" thread a month before that so I think we can all assume you are full of... shit.

I can't find the footage of him getting arrested. Do you have a link?
@_date: 2018-01-28 07:24:03
Ha! Thank you for giving me a new way to describe my employment status.
As someone in a similar position (not from Bitcoin or any crypto) I have found that time management is the most important skill. It's easy to waste time when you can do whatever you want, whenever you want... I am working on increasing my productivity and find it to be a bit of challenge. Perhaps it won't be to you though.
Oh and congratulations!

The fuck? I was reading it just last night!

If a million dollars is 5% of OP's net worth, sure.
@_date: 2017-12-09 00:20:07
That's probably true about women and risks. It's the opposite in my family though, my mother has been the investor/businesswoman with taste for risk and my father the voice for moderation. I think I'm somewhere in the middle.
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:54:35
I totally agree.
And thank you for the welcome :) It's been an interesting few months!
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:24:41
I understand exactly how you feel. I'm not as happy as I thought I would be. I was genuinely happy when it broke $10k, but this is making me a little nervous...
@_date: 2017-12-09 00:28:03
But you've kept the dog! &lt;3
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:08:03
It makes me a bit sad every time I read this on this sub (which is often.) I wish more women were interested and active in Bitcoin/crypto.
@_date: 2017-12-28 02:04:19
Yes, please!
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:24:49
That's when I got in seriously. I've been playing around with it for a while now, but always felt like it was too late to put too much in... looking back that was the perfect timing!
@_date: 2017-12-08 06:57:22
So happy to find that you are a woman, we need more women here &lt;3
@_date: 2017-12-09 00:21:19
Yay! &lt;3
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:22:30
So are you not a woman? :(
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:24:01
That's most likely true!
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:47:35
That's awesome!
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:26:50
Same here. Been hearing about it for years, started playing around a few months ago, got in seriously at China dip- looking back it wasn't too bad of a timing. I held back in the beginning because it didn't really work with what I learned in school (studied econ) so I totally understand why some economists still have a dim view of it. I myself still have a lot of questions, but I am also excited about the future.
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:48:57
Hello &lt;3
@_date: 2017-12-13 20:56:03
I second this. It would change so many people's lives.
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:03:53
Yes, and I hope so too. But my point still stands that she should know the potential risks as well as gains.
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:25:30
If you genuinely don't want half of world population to not get into it, then I guess you aren't hoping for broad adoption...
@_date: 2017-12-09 14:35:10


Source? Can't find a single case let alone multiple as you describe.
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:33:44
I never said women aren't involved. I'm a woman, I'm involved. I got into it with another female friend. I only said I wish *more* women were. Do you disagee that the majority of crypto community is men?

Hello &lt;3

I feel like people who see this as an attack on crypto must not have any experience with investing/managing their assets.
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:01:40
I read about people taking out large loans and not paying student loans to buy bitcoin. I hope it works out for everyone, but it's hard not to be a bit concerned.
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:56:56
If women are the majority, then color me pleasantly surprised! Perhaps ratio is skewed around me.
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:12:22


Or it could be $1000. I feel like it isn't right to present this as an investment option with compounded interest. She should know all the amazing possibilities, but also risks.
@_date: 2017-12-09 00:41:56
Oh I believe it. I just meant my parents are a bit of anomaly.
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:22:27
Yep. Quoted text is exactly how they tracked down that Silk Road dude.

What are some of more popular forums to discuss Bitcoin in Korea? I would love to check them out.
@_date: 2017-12-09 00:43:50
@_date: 2017-12-12 04:26:13
I can read Korean :)
Thank you!

I grew up surrounded by huge wealth- close friends with a billionaire's daughter and several children of hundred-millionaires- and I was told that it's better to be 500-millionaire than a billionaire. Once you become a billionaire, the amount of publicity and attention increases exponentially while the lifestyle basically remains the same. There are few things a billionaire can afford but a 500-millionaire can't.

@_date: 2017-12-08 15:20:22
Absolutely... I read about people taking out loans to buy BTC. That... scares me a bit. Scared for them I mean. I hope the gamble pays off, of course, but it's just a crazy move.
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:30:13
Is Bitcoin the only way you will be a millionaire?
@_date: 2017-12-19 02:49:41
It's a fun thought, but probably not true. There are reporters whose life's work is chase the super rich. They keep track of who lives at/owns expensive addresses (e.g. One57, 15 CPW, 740 Park in NYC), owners of all the mega yachts, famous artworks, and named jewelry pieces, who attends the gala parties, who's in whose social circle, etc. It would only be possible if they manage to own very little in their own name, hold no known positions in business/industry, don't participate at all in social acticity with their peers, etc. Very hard to do as a truly wealthy person. Of course a lot of them do try to hide their wealth as much as possible, but it's only possible to a certain extent.
Very old money like Rothchilds are not on the richest list simply because they aren't super wealthy as an individual, not because of conspiracy. Even an extremely large fortune becomes not so large when it's split between multiple branches of the family with numerous descendants.

Seems like you made a poor choice when selecting a mate and are blaming it on women as a whole.
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:14:44
If he invested money he earned during the marriage, money belongs to both of them legally. At least in the US.
Besides, his question seemed to imply that he's looking for a way to talk to his wife. Not just say "fuck you, not your money."
@_date: 2018-05-13 02:42:26
Same, millenial but not an idiot. 1% of my assets is the most I'm willing to have in crypto at this time.
@_date: 2018-05-14 17:27:10
Nothing stopping you from having multiple accounts.
@_date: 2018-05-14 16:56:09
Something happened to FDIC deposit insurance?
@_date: 2018-06-17 15:35:46
Same here. I'm like Mr. Crabs.
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:55:54
What is the best way to track Bitcoin price?
@_date: 2017-11-26 13:25:42
개이득? 개이득.

Sounds like a new account.
