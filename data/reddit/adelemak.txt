mine is yubikey neo, not affected : )
if you read the details, it said the OTP function is not affected too, so it is completely save to use with bitfinex.

I am using bitfinex and protect my account with a yubikey, this hardware is needed to plug into USB port every time I login the website, without it nobody can change the withdrawal address too, I think everyone should use this hardware key instead of a simple 2FA protection.

This campaign is a civil uprising of attacking HK's monetary base by withdrawing USD from banking system, because HKD is Pegged to USD, the goal is to remove 50B USD from HKMA's reserve, making the HKD vulnerable, people of HK believe HKMA handovered 400B of USD to mainland china secretly. 
You can find some people upload photos of USD withdraw from bank in this forum 
Sadly, 99.99% of HK people still consider crypto is a scam or money laundering tools.

China can actually shutdown national bitcoin network by deny TCP port 8333, or deny protocol signatures in firewall setting, but BTC mining is actually an export business for foreign currency, it is too stupid for China gov to ban the protocol.

Recent interview of Jihan Wu by Huobi  
here is some translations  


Blockstream control Core and brainwashing the commnuity


BU and BCC share the same group of developer


because of Core's betrayal, BCC come to bring old freedom to community


BCC development, i.e. the implementation of schnorr signatures, will faster than other chain


the birth of BCC is a reaction of Blockstream bring too much FUD to the community 


hashrate oscillation is interesting, I learn a lot from it


EDA algorithm of BCC implemented in a rush, more adjustment will come to mitigate the hashrate oscillation


BCC listed on top 100 worldwide exchange, those not supported is irrelevant


Please don't call BCC as China coin or	 Jihan coin


BCC will reach VISA level by introduce GB class block eventually


BCC will have smart contract by implementation of Rootstock, fully compatible with ETH


BTC is for the rich, store of value is their selling point, not payment, and their fee is getting higher


if cryptocurrency not pay attention to main street economy, then it is a Ponzi scheme, yet another shearing event, not sustainable


BCC's EDA algorithm will be improved by next hard fork


BCC will delete the outdated ledger, BCC trustless node will not need to download whole blockchain in the future


no special regulation for mining business yet


hard fork is good, BTC should have a try when losing hashrate in the future


we accept BCC, our miner will sell for BCC with a discount too

BCC is a business contingency plan for china miner and exchange when china ban the bitcoin, it is intended to become a domestic (may be official)  crypto currency for Chinese, western people may think it is worthless but I won't underestimate the value of BCC.
