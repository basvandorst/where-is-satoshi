I think this is an amazing thing to do. It's too bad that so many local outfits who could benefit from a donation such as this aren't equipped to handle BTC donations. There should be a service that can help these small orgs.

I'm a little confused here. I buy BTC from Coinbase, transfer to GDAX. (GDAX to Binance for alts, maybe irrelevant.) Can I transfer from GDAX to Ledger?

Ah, thanks for that.

I started with Coinbase (pending ACH transfer) and since both are free for ACH deposit on Coinbase and GDAX, what's the advantage to transferring to GDAX? My plan is to buy BTC and eventually transfer to a hardware wallet like Trezor or Ledger.

Damn, scary especially since I’m just now getting into BTC. Will try to spread the word.
@_date: 2017-11-12 00:24:42
Ah, thank you for the explanation

What's a hodler?
@_date: 2017-11-09 19:15:55
Trezor and Ledger are considered private yes? But the risk is you can lose the usb...

I'm new to it all, what I see is potential to get in on BTC now and hope that if the 2X fails, it'll push BTC up higher. And, you get B2X (or whatever it will be labeled as) and you can sell it for more BTC.
