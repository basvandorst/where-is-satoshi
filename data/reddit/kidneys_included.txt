Buy through GDAX, Coinbase's trading platform. If you have a Coinbase account, you already have a GDAX account (same login). Much lower fees, even free if you do a limit order.

Coinbase is designed to be for "beginners" while GDAX is slightly more "advanced." I put those in quotation marks because I honestly don't find GDAX that much more confusing or hard to use. Maybe for complete newbies, the charts with all the squiggly lines are too scary? I don't know. Some people just want a big button that reads "Buy Bitcoin," I guess.
The only advantages I see to Coinbase is that you can buy with a credit card and withdraw to PayPal. You can't do either with GDAX. I personally don't care about either of those, just transfer in with a bank account.

It's two separate accounts, but you can transfer between the two of them easily.

Almost. You need to fund your account first. So, you'd deposit USD, then once it's there, you follow the steps you outlined, and you'll have your BTC immediately. 
(It's immediate as long as your order is filled, which isn't a problem as long as you're buying at the current market rate. Like, say you type in 1BTC at $6500, you're going to have to wait until BTC actually drops to $6500 before your order is filled.)
