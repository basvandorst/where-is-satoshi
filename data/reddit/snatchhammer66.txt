Well that exists already...

I mean I get that. But it just seems like for an average person it wouldn’t be attractive because it seems like such a small amount. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 05:11:52
Guess we will see what they do lol 
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:40:05
Bitcoin only has value because people are supporting it and mining it. Both of those things could quit happening and then Bitcoin wouldn't be worth anything. Is that likely? Probably not. But even if it is unlikely that means that some risk is involved because it is not impossible. If you are talking about millions of dollars why would you add more risk than necessary for no value? Also sites that allow merchant accounts (Coinbase) are not stable either. Look at today, I can't even receive my Bitcoin transaction. More risk that is unnecessary. I don't think you get that nothing is risk less.

I think if people really want bitcoin to take off, it needs to be marketable to the masses. Your average person is going to be scared off by how it is now. That’s my opinion at least. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:26:19
Is it immediate though? With the volatility of the market large transactions are subject to large fluctuations. If it is immediate and the amount is guaranteed then that is a different story.
@_date: 2017-11-29 13:46:27
Alright that makes sense. I still don’t think there is “no risk”, but that is definitely better.
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:25:28
Is it done immediately with zero wait? Like if you receive bitcoin it stays at that value no matter what? If not then it would be risky to receive large payments in bitcoin because of fluctuation. Now if it is an immediate payout the minute you receive the bitcoin so you avoid any movement then it would be fine. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 13:47:57
Interesting. I still think there is definitely risk involved. But that is much better than I assumed.
@_date: 2017-11-28 04:48:34
I still think that is too complicated for the average person. People are dumb lol 
@_date: 2017-11-28 05:05:14
As long as it is simple and clear that’s all that matters. I just think it would be smart to make sure it copies our current system in some way to make it “familiar.”
@_date: 2017-11-28 04:56:48
It definitely has a long road ahead of it. At least I think so. It needs to be simpler and convenient to use, which it currently isn’t. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:07:08
Zero risk? Lol 
@_date: 2017-11-28 04:55:14
I think you give the average person too much credit. We still can’t even switch to the metric system here in the US lol 
@_date: 2017-11-28 05:42:46
That is my hope as well! I need to buy more though. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 04:51:07
It makes sense to me, but how do we make it a simple transition for people who are used to our current currency?
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:00:13
That is assuming that bitcoin continues to have value. The issue is it is all speculative right now. It would be zero risk if bitcoin was stable and established, but at any point the market could potentially crash. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 04:54:08
But to someone who is uniformed that makes bitcoin seem like it doesn’t have value. I understand it, but if you told someone that was skeptical about bitcoin that, they would try and compare it to dollars. Especially since it will continue to change. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 13:12:22
You added a word there. I mostly listen to podcasts and audio books: I usually don’t get my info from this sub because it biased and full of memes. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 04:49:17
Holy shit that seems confusing for the average consumer lol 
@_date: 2017-11-28 04:46:55
It’s just too complicated for the average person.
@_date: 2017-11-28 13:12:52
I work in the financial industry, people don’t like change.
@_date: 2017-11-28 04:50:15
It will be interesting to see how they handle it. I love bitcoin but goddamn is it hard to market to people. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 05:08:53
I completely agree. I was just randomly thinking about it. I have explained bitcoin to so many people now, it’s little things like this that I think could potentially hinder bitcoin if something isn’t adopted. Clearly there are many smart people already considering this, I just had never heard any of the discussion in my research. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:43:42
If you want to spread out you purchases, that is usually the best way to hedge against price increase
@_date: 2017-11-30 13:05:01
You clearly do not understand “no risk” lol 
@_date: 2017-11-28 05:06:30
Honestly I was just thinking about it now and didn’t have any ideas. It just kind of popped up lol I will be thinking about it for the next few days though
