What's BitConnect and what happened with it? 
@_date: 2018-01-11 05:08:39
very possible. they pulled some shady stuff a few weeks ago suspending trading around when it reached a similar price. i think the additional traffic does have some effect on it too but it’s hard to say where one stops and the other begins. 
@_date: 2018-01-18 22:49:31
This reminds me of the drop a few weeks ago, a few days before Christmas. Once the price had recovered, it kept going up and down, up and down...
@_date: 2018-01-02 18:38:22
True. I got in without any issues. I think it’s just a matter of the male demographic catching interest to crypto faster. 
@_date: 2018-01-11 04:59:39
there’ll be some short term panic but it also might take longer than usual to recover. no saying how low it goes, either. i’m headed to bed so i’m interested to see what the prices’ll be in the morning.

Basically a company came in and said they’d give everyone a virtual dollar (Tether, USDT) for every USD you give them. Provided they actually had the money, that’s not a problem, but it has been looking for a while now like they were just using it as a front. They’ve refused on multiple occasions to show proof of their funds, so now it’s led to a subpoena.
Essentially the implication is that the price of crypto is even more inflated than we thought because it was being tied to dollars that either don’t actually exist or no longer exist. 
That’s a simplified version, at least. I don’t think I’m as knowledgeable as the others here to provide you with the full rundown. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 14:13:45
Price is staying fairly steady thanks to all you guys who are buying the dip. Is this the floor?
@_date: 2018-01-16 14:19:44
No. It’s not worth it. We’re all here for you if you need it. 
Plus it could always spring back up anyway. There’s no telling if it’ll continue to drop.

coinbase services are very quick to go down when people panic sell because they have trouble handling the influx of trades. it’s possible that any service outage may have prevented you from receiving notifications. 
@_date: 2018-01-30 18:40:53
Good time to buy. 
@_date: 2018-01-11 05:02:51
any regulation will have a negative effect on bitcoin
@_date: 2018-01-28 22:41:43
I’d rather have a stable price with low volume than a volatile price and volume. 
@_date: 2018-01-14 21:41:48
Glad to see BTC is finding its real value and that the floor is already so high. I imagine it hurts if you have thousands of dollars in it, but this means it should pay off in the long term. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 23:11:11
If people are putting their BTC in exchanges they are more than likely looking to cash out (or trade between altcoins)
@_date: 2018-01-31 14:43:59
Honestly I expected the price to be a lot lower when going to check this morning... I'm pretty happy with the price it's at now, but that might be a bit of an unpopular opinion.
@_date: 2018-01-05 22:10:30
hope everything works out for you :D
@_date: 2018-01-11 05:20:44
did anyone manage to buy the dip? Stayed up a few more minutes once I saw the price beginning to recover, and here we are again back at square one...
@_date: 2018-01-28 22:42:44
Is price increasing due to LN adoption or is it unrelated? 
@_date: 2018-01-30 18:47:40
Tether is being subpoenaed 
@_date: 2018-01-30 18:42:16
I don’t think it’ll fall all the way to 2-3k but I can see it being 7k or so. 
@_date: 2018-01-30 20:45:57
In which direction? Too high or too low?
@_date: 2018-01-05 15:01:21
What’s with all the volume fluctuation I’ve been seeing lately? People moving money between altcoins?
@_date: 2018-01-31 14:10:35
Yeah I totally agree with you I just think it’s going to be a little while until we start seeing the positive effects of this :/
@_date: 2018-01-26 14:31:34
Must be related. Can't daytrade if you're not getting a good Starbucks experience.
@_date: 2018-01-30 18:35:00
For some people things like Tether are what makes BTC’s price “real”. Otherwise they can’t (or refuse to) comprehend that people would otherwise see it as valuable. So yes I would expect it to drop after this news. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:42:03
yeah, probably. I'm very new to this myself, so you should probably listen to the other guys first. :P
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:30:46
What the fuck, I bought like 30 minutes ago and the coin is already like $200 higher than it was when I bought it... 
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:39:42
yeah, I'm not trying to say everyone who's leaving isn't really 'in it'—I'm talking specifically about the people who only got here a month  or two ago, not those who have been in it for years
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:51:14
you guys are such pessimists lol. It's already bouncing back.
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:47:50
I just used Coinbase for the first time and am having some nuisances with it. Very slow with large fees. I hear Gemini is pretty good but you should wait for the veteran traders to weigh in.
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:03:58
they mean to say that the dips are getting smaller and smaller as time goes on (it's plateauing). a weird way to put it though... lol...
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:05:00
even if value does plummet today I'm just going to buy more and futureproof myself.
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:08:42
now would be a decent time to buy
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:22:38
Well yeah that's kind of the point. It's not supposed to be viewed like a traditional currency. 


That would go against the nature of Bitcoin. Granted, they already do to some extent. Coinbase suspended trading earlier at a shady time.
@_date: 2017-12-24 15:51:20
slightly unrelated but merry christmas everyone. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:40:37
yeah. I'm not complaining. It's a nice little rush!
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:33:00
Don't get me wrong, I'm somewhat sympathetic to them, but at the same time I can't help but be a little skeptical. Personally I'd say it's half them and half the customers. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:43:21
wasn't there a similar drop like this a few weeks ago around the time it hit $10k?
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:32:34
I've never felt so alive as today
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:12:43
Just bought my first 0.015. I don't really care if it loses all value since it wasn't much of an initial first investment to begin with (I can afford losing $200). Nice to be along for the ride though
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:03:29
use another exchange.
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:21:39
do you guys think it's too late to buy more?
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:10:25




@_date: 2017-12-22 16:45:08
Literally just transferred from Coinbase an hour ago (went through 55m ago according to the email) because I felt something like this coming... dodged a bit of a bullet there, I guess.
@_date: 2017-12-27 16:09:41
for bitcoin this is completely normal/steady
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:08:29
the problem comes with is people treating BTC like a traditional currency rather than a crypto. wall street-style investing doesn't fully transfer to crypto because it's a different market and idea entirely, so this sort of thing weeds out the people looking to make a quick buck.
@_date: 2017-12-30 15:57:25
Understandably. XRP probably feels much safer for regular people to invest in since it's a centralized cryptocurrency. I figure it will do well in the short term but I'm not sure if it'll last. 
That said, I might transfer a few satoshis to XRP.
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:26:33
they aren't even being subtle about it, are they?
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:37:50
Price has been fairly steady at $17K CAD for a while now. People sure do like their round numbers, huh?
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:20:56
I think Bitcoin is a valuable and necessary currency and it or something much like it will be widely used in the future, especially for those of us in shady job fields, but I'm just buying and selling at the moment. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:09:18
yeah, I'm thinking along the same lines. I only own a very small amount so it won't make a big difference for me either way, but I hope things go OK for some of the people on this sub.
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:02:42
do you guys think Bitcoin reached its all-time peak with $21k USD or whatever it was? I'm planning to hodl either way, but it's interesting to think about
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:33:27
I would cash out and then maybe re-invest some of what you get from that.
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:36:13
yes, and today is separating the people who bought into the meme from the hardcore investors (for better or worse).
@_date: 2018-03-20 20:06:36
He ran as a politician here in Canada about a year ago before dropping out, but I imagine it’d mean trouble for crypto if he ever comes into power.
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:24:23
Couldn’t you theoretically put this in your website’s javascript and unknowingly have people mine for you? Of course, if you have Javascript disabled by default, it wouldn’t be a problem. Maybe adblockers would cover that, too. 
That said, I do now understand how miners work/are coded thanks to this. I appreciate it. 
@_date: 2018-02-12 18:03:03
Wonder if the market is turning bullish again already. I kinda doubt it, since the last cycle just ended and it usually takes a few months, but Bitcoin is unpredictable. 
@_date: 2018-03-01 01:17:15
Blockchain-chan?
