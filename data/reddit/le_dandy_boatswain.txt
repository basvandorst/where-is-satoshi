What's the point of this though? You could just use a free library to do OCR and geolocation already, no pay-for-play slow API calls necessary. I would bet that these API are just using free stuff like Tesseract OCR and MaxMind GeoLite anyway.

You just described Ad-hoc WiFi networking, which is already possible with today's existing WiFi routers. There is a reason that it is not widespread however (inherent inefficiency coupled with ubiquitous 'traditional' internet access).

Like a BGP peering agreement? As in exactly what existing ISP and public service providers currently do to interconnect with one another?

Wacky idealism aside, it's clear that the author doesn't really understand the ramifications of his proposal. It makes no economic sense, and much of what he is calling for describes the internet technology that exists currently.


No, it was created for government and academic research collaboration. It was born out of the DoD. [[1]](


Tons of baseless claims in this chunk. No point in even addressing them.


The protocols that run the internet are open standards maintained by the IETF, and can be viewed in their RFC documents. [[2]]( There are multiple open source implementations of these protocols that are part projects like Linux, *BSD etc. For example, in FreeBSD the source code for the network stack is located in /usr/src/sys/netinet.


You describe a router. Commodity hardware running OpenBSD is a proven open source example of this. Use BGP to "discover" links between large groupings of networks, and OSPF within these autonomous systems. Both of these protocols are described in RFC and have multiple open source implementations. [[3]](


TCP/IP and company are standards based, have multiple open source implementations and have demonstrated maturity through decades of use. What else would you want?


And who will pay all these engineers six figure salaries? this type of labor is not cheap.


You're missing the elephant in the room here. The router you are proposing is the easy part: it is the dark fiber laid under the ground that will be the biggest challenge to get a working alternative infrastructure going. It would cost billions of dollars and take many years to build this out. Maybe you could lease it from AT&amp;T?

You should probably read up on BGP [[1]]( BGP peering [[2]]( and Interconnect Agreements [[3]]( What you are casually suggesting would take a team of lawyers and millions of dollars to accomplish.

What a pointless site. It doesn't explain any of the products; all I see is a bio page, a sideshow of images with no context and a few other random pages that do nothing.

Sounds like you may be interested in [WiMAX \(802.16\)]( I'm not sure why it never caught on, it is an interesting technology.

I was surprised that vmware has been around since 1999

But it's got what ~~plants~~ developers crave.
