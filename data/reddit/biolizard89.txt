Generally speaking, your BTC income will be unaffected by use of merged mining; the NMC is just a bonus.  Similarly, if the pool you use merge-mines multiple coins (e.g. Huntercoin or Devcoin in addition to Namecoin), those extra merge-mined coins don't affect each other's income.

I've never heard of that site, but if it's sorting by market cap, that's a meaningless metric.  Namecoin is a naming system; trying to compare it to currencies doesn't make any sense.

So sorry for the delayed response, things are busy in my personal life here.
I was aware that Zach was meeting with some BitShares developers to talk about potential areas of common interest.  I didn't know any details, nor did I see that thread you linked.  Not speaking for Namecoin, but the framing in that thread is not what I would have preferred personally.  I haven't talked to Zach about this in any significant amount of detail, so I'll decline to comment since I don't have anything particularly informed to say on the subject.  Thanks for bringing it up though -- it's good to have transparency.

Which Namecoin dev are you referring to?  I'm a Namecoin dev, and to my knowledge none of the Namecoin devs works for Bitshares.  There is a third-party project called DNSChain which uses both Namecoin and Bitshares, but it's not affiliated with the Namecoin devs in any way.

(Namecoin developer here.) An AuxPoW parent block is not required to be valid on any particular chain; the only requirement is that it needs to meet the PoW target of the child chain.  (Technically there are other requirements present to prevent obscure attacks, but they're not relevant here.)  Several of the blocks on the Namecoin blockchain (especially right after the AuxPoW hardfork activated) have a parent block that isn't from Bitcoin or any other blockchain.
There have been alternative AuxPoW proposals (i.e. drivechains) that do require a particular chain to be the parent chain, but currently Namecoin doesn't use any of those proposals.

(Namecoin dev here.)  We actually released code for exactly this use case recently (using funding from NLnet Foundation).  Documentation still is kind of lacking for this, and it needs to be built from source code (no binaries yet), but it does work.

The SPV name lookup client is using BitcoinJ/libdohj, which is written in Java.  The SPV name wallet will be using Electrum, which is written in Python.  Java does have its drawbacks, but its memory safety is a lot better than C++, and BitcoinJ is in sufficiently widespread use that we expect it to be relatively free of horrible security vulnerabilities compared to less widely deployed SPV implementations.  Same goes for Electrum.
That said, if you want a C++ SPV client (either name lookup or wallet), I've heard that Bitcoin Core will be adding an SPV mode, which we'll presumably merge to Namecoin Core when/if Bitcoin Core's developers consider it stable enough to merge.

(Namecoin dev here.) We released a beta of Namecoin's PKI for HTTPS a few weeks ago (funded by NLnet Foundation).  I'd suggest waiting for the 2nd beta though (should be out in a week or so), which will address the initial round of bug reports that are inevitable in a first release.

(I'm a Namecoin developer.)  An SPV name lookup client is actually already working and released.  It's listed as "beta" for 2 reasons:
1. It relies on some changes to 3rd party libraries that aren't yet upstreamed, which makes maintenance more time-consuming.
2. Builds aren't yet reproducible like Namecoin Core is, which means that hypothetically I could have introduced a backdoor into the binaries I released and the other developers wouldn't have been able to tell.
We tend to have fairly high standards for code that doesn't have the "beta" label, but if the above 2 issues aren't a dealbreaker for you, you can do Namecoin name lookups with SPV right now.  It takes about 10 minutes to fully synchronize in leveldbtxcache mode (which is what I usually recommend).
An SPV name *wallet* isn't yet ready, but we have funding from NLnet Foundation's Internet Hardening Fund for this, so hopefully we'll have something ready soon.

Namecoin wasn't always merge-mined.  At some point before Namecoin activated the AuxPoW hardfork, someone posted a thread on BitcoinTalk announcing that Namecoin was more profitable to mine than Bitcoin.  Loads of Bitcoin miners switched to Namecoin until the next Namecoin difficulty adjustment, and then switched back to Bitcoin, which caused Namecoin to suffer immensely long block times for a while.  The introduction of AuxPoW fixed this vulnerability in Namecoin.

Agree 100% that 3 people donating $10 is more valuable than 1 person donating $30.  That said, for people who are willing to donate $30 *in addition to* telling their friends/contacts, I think the extra $20 is still helpful.

When Apple decides to stop shipping DRM malware to their customers that prevents those customers from installing apps that Apple didn't approve, I might consider spending development effort on supporting iOS.  Until then, it's not a safe investment of my development time, because Apple could easily ban Namecoin software from its devices on a whim (or based on a government request, which actually just happened in the real world).

It's on Crowd Supply (not Indiegogo), and [they do accept Bitcoin]( it's just not via an automated process.  Also my understanding is that you can buy multiple instances of the $10 option, so e.g. if you wanted to donate $30, you would buy 3 instances of the $10 option.

It's not obvious to me that Vince and Khal left due to mining profitability issues, any more than Satoshi left for those reasons.  I got the impression that they simply moved onto other things that interested them more.  (Mikhail, of course, left involuntarily -- he died from a stroke.)  Lots of open-source projects (and other projects) have significant developer churn, it's not that unusual.

On the contrary, Namecoin is very much surviving.  (I'm a Namecoin developer.)

I received this email to an address that (as far as I can tell) has never been used with any Bitcoin companies, but was in the Namecoin blockchain.  Maybe the scammers scraped the Namecoin blockchain for email addresses.  Anyone else receive this to an email that was in the Namecoin blockchain?

Hi, Namecoin developer here.
Namecoin is already a sidechain.  In fact, it was the first sidechain.  (Specifically a merge-mined sidechain.)
I assume you meant a *pegged* sidechain, in which case I'd love to see Namecoin become a pegged sidechain.  The main issue is simply that the pegged sidechain technology is sufficiently new and unproven that we haven't adopted it yet.  If/when the sidechain tech issues are worked out (which I hope will happen), I'd absolutely support Namecoin becoming a pegged sidechain.
Cheers.
