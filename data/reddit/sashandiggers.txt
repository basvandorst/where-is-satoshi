the only problem is by the time lightning starts, btc's value would have moved over to bitcoin cash. btc will die, just as visa, mastercard, core devs, and the mods to this site wished for.. bitcoin cash was forked to save bitcoin.

well fundamentally yes. why would the population want to wait longer and pay more for day to day transaction on one currency that has capped block sizes filled up, when there is the alternative that does the opposite? segwit 2x was aimed to make it 500kb i think?.. its exactly what the banks want. believe me or not thats your choice. plans for bitcoin is to burn it so no one can use it and resort to banks on their chain (my understanding of it but im still learning)
bitcoin cash was made to prevent this from happening.

bitcoin cash and p2p will save the bitcoin meaning.. do your research, you will find it will be easy for an 80 year old to use bitcoin.. the 8mb block bitcoin i mean.
Many new things are coming. its just early days in the development era.
