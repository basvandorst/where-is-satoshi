Amazon did not shut down,Google did not shut down, nor countless others. Just because ask Jeeves and other dumb ideas went broke it does not mean that those based in sound ideas were doomed to ruin. I own my own business and it has taken far more than ten years to get it running to a decent efficient machine that it is now and that is in a field that was already established. When you think about crypto being only ten years old through the same eyes I think maybe you will have a more reasonable and leveled expectation of this space.

To the people saying it's over do you really think that the thousands of companies with their employees that are all working on crypto projects are all just going to shut their doors and tell everyone to go home. Do you think Justin Sun will close down Tron or Charles Hoskins will tell everyone at IOHK it's over let's call it quits. While you may not like some of these projects I think their involvement and others belief and hard work they have put in to bitcoin and crypto is far from over.We can argue over price all you want but the bottom line is people are working hard to bring this technology to the people from all over the world.

You are absolutely correct. Referencing start up statistics for businesses you will see that over 50% fail in under 4 years in fact smallbiztrends.com states that only 4% of businesses made it to the second year in 2011. Which reinforces my point about investing in crypto is almost exactly as investing in a small business and should be looked at through the same eyes. While working product is the goal you should also be evaluating working capital,exposure to possible clients,and leadership in the field or company. When people make all these price predictions I ask myself why would someone pay “x” for this product

While the zeppelin did not succeed,the field of aeronautics did  and in just over 100 years we have gone from a few seconds of flight, to landing a man on the moon, to commercial jet flight, to landing robots on Mars. If anything I feel like your statement proves my point.
