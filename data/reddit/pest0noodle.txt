Nobody knows how high the price will go, but let's say that you would be able to acquire those 3 btc and the price would go, let's say to 40k usd per btc and you would live in India. 
So 120k usd in India is "a bit" different than 120k usd in Japan.

Let's see how long does it for us, the apes, to adopt it and begin to use it. How long did it take the apes to become a space faring civilization in Space Odyssey?

I've wondered with bitcoin that is the market cap always in straight correlation with the price of bitcoin?
Because people always say in these forums that it can't go higher than the market cap really is.
But in the bull runs it still seems not to follow any logical correlations and isn't bound to any market cap?
@_date: 2019-01-04 18:18:07
Aaaaa, ok.
Interesting to see, if that pans out, that how it will affect the price of bitcoin what will it be then. ��

So what constitutes mainstream adoption. It is currently being used by under 1% of worlds population. So you are saying that in 6 years it's going to be like the internet is today?
What about monetary mainstream adoption compared to fiat currencies? So it's going to be side to side with fiat currencies in 6 years?
@_date: 2019-01-06 12:46:47
Yeah, you have to be aware of the volatility of the market, so it won't come as a surprise to you when the market fluctuates.
