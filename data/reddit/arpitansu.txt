I don't understand how bitcoin is different than this?

I love seeing people who love bitcoin crying when it goes down. You people are just waiting it to replace gold or something aren't you?

Seriously? Replace gold. Mate you don't loose gold just because you lost your key. This is the biggest flaw Bitcoin have. And if i assume this happen then 1 Bitcoin will cost like more than a billion or something. Stop dreaming.

people I've made crypto named "shitcoin" starting price will be $100,000 because that's what I decide it to be and there will be only 2 coins available 1 for me and 1 for the whole world. Argue.

Nothing, shitcoin makes no sense, only for blackmarketting.

Don't invest in Bitcoin, it'll never get accepted globally may be illegally it'll work but world govs will never accept it and Bitcoin doesn't even make sense as a currency.

I have 10 potatoes in my house, everyone can have them but cannot eat them, for no reason prices will go high or low. Bitcoin will never be accepted just accept it.
