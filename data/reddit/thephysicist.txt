Hey sorry you lost money.  I started investing in January 2018 (about 17 months ago) and I’m up 19%
I bought all the way down from $12k to $3k.  I went in balls deep at the bottom.  So that’s why I’m still nicely in profit even after the latest dip. 
Buy as much as you can while the blood is fresh in the streets.

@_date: 2019-07-01 18:56:13
Just ask anyone that jumped off as it rose from
~$3k to $5k thinking they were so smart. Now it’s over $10k.  You may get lucky timing the market sometimes, but in the long run with bitcoin you will do incredibly well and save yourself a lot of stress just by buying more and hodling long term.
@_date: 2019-07-01 21:22:17
Stop listening to other people on this forum and look at the fundamentals of the technology, the development by major players Winklevoss Twins making it possible to use bitcoin at places like Starbucks etc.  Fidelity’s custodial solutions and trading desk.  Coinstar.  Bakkt exchange.  Facebook Libra coming out next year which will bring major interest in crypto. Look at the long term trend and patterns.  Over the last 9 years bitcoin bubbles up and crashes down. After each crash it ALWAYS rises higher than before and that is mainly because of the math.  The halvening every four years allows a smaller supply which increases scarcity as long as the demand keeps up.  The future looks very bright.  This time next year you should start getting very happy.
@_date: 2018-09-12 17:49:58
A slow and steady rise would probably be the best thing for Bitcoin and any latecomers like us. 
@_date: 2018-09-12 14:16:22
Guess you missed the text box that explains the line was drawn based on average year over year increase due to halvings of 200%.  It is a simple mathematical extrapolation model. 
Oh and my short term prediction was that there would be a price boost upon the lines crossing on the cb pro one day chart.  Upon the crossing, price boosted $400 (5%) over a few days.  Anyone making a short term play would have made some money if they sold in time before the massive sudden whale dump.  I cannot predict when whales will decide to wake up and manipulate the market against its natural trend.

I feel bad for the guy who lost his money in crypto, but his mistake in this bear market was trying to run from Bitcoin by putting his money in alts.

Ooohhh I see.   How is today’s large dip which took us below the ema26 6hr chart not a bearish sign? 
@_date: 2018-09-19 18:01:24
I agree mostly with your points.  I also think once the price gets high enough due to the sheer number of hodlers and spenders, adoption by merchants should really kick in.   Then many of those hodlers who used to be tempted to sell to convert to fiat at the highs will instead actually begin to spend the bitcoin directly for goods and services.  At that point the price should be stable enough to support usage as a currency by the masses.

Another heads up folks: 
Ema12 is nearing passage above the ema26 line on the cb pro ** 1 DAY** chart.  This frequently indicates the price should continue to rise for a period after a clear crossing is observed.  By the looks of the chart at this moment, we are within a day or two of this event (my best guess). With the rapidity of our current ascent - target anytime this weekend. 
Strong resistance ahead though, so do your own research.  Also, due to the small size of this market, there is always a great risk that a random bear-whale could drop the price again at any moment.
Edit:   15 hour update:  that bear rejection of 6800 has sent us back in the 6600’s.  This means it is still possible for the ema12 to cross the ema26, but it it will take longer.  Unless we get some nice bullish momentum over the next day or so, new rough target for the crossing is early next week.   If bears can push price below $6600 and keep it there, then lines will not cross and my prognosis will turn bearish for the week ahead.

Heh maybe.  I don’t believe a lot of TA methodology, but when the moving averages cross I pay attention because they seem to indicate changing sentiment.

The institutional money we have all been waiting for will come as soon as custodial solutions are built and mature.  The foundation is being built right now. 
Look at all the good things starting to happen already in the institutional scene.  Read and be happy:
“The crypto sector has had arguably one of the best weeks in its nine-year history pertaining to institutionalization and regulation.
Over the past three days, Valdis Dombrovskis, vice president of the European Commission, said that cryptocurrencies will co-exist with the financial system, Nasdaq is preparing to release a crypto analytics tool for investors, Citigroup has shared its plans to support crypto custody, and Winklevoss twins-led Gemini has launched the first fully audited and licensed stablecoin in the market, called Gemini dollar (GUST).
The recognition of the cryptocurrency sector and the market’s growth throughout this year by the European Commission and a high ranking official in Dombrovskis is crucial for the long-term growth of the European cryptocurrency and blockchain sector.”

@_date: 2018-09-01 15:56:22
$7172 on Bitstamp 
Anyone that acted upon my TA a few days ago and bought is now in the green by over $100 bitcoin price.  The price is likely to rise through most of September as well. 
I admit my timing was off, but I’m taking partial credit for the prediction.  
When the ema12 crosses the ema26 on the cb pro one day chart the price tends to react. The lines are clearly crossed now.   Take note u/manbrodudeguy
@_date: 2018-09-12 13:08:14

I need to be more precise about what I am actually predicting, true. I foresaw the boost coming when the ema12 was about to cross the ema26 on the one day chart. But my mistake was  trying to give everyone a heads up that it would very likely start at the days close on Wednesday. The lines had not crossed yet by then. It took another 2 days to have a clean crossover imo. 
That is why I am only taking partial credit for the call. 
I do not often try to predict short term price action, because it is often very hard or impossible, but I will try harder in the future to be more precise. 
@_date: 2018-09-15 00:31:14

@_date: 2018-09-01 23:43:43

Hey Bears �� if you really think bitcoin is doomed to go to zero, then how come every time it has gone below $6k it comes back up shortly after?   This has been proven all year long.  
You know what?  You don’t have what it takes to break bitcoin.  The spirit of the hodlers is stronger than ever and the true floor is much higher than it was in 2016 before the parabolic growth period of 2017. 
Put up or shut up.  Short it if you dare. Try to crash it to zero right now.  You will be rekt as the rubber band snaps back up.  I’m tired of the bullshit.  Go ahead, I dare you!

@_date: 2018-09-17 16:25:07
Absolutely.  And I bet they will be thrilled to finally have their bitcoin back.  Not to sell, but to hodl until the next bull run.   It is almost a near certainty to me that the bull run will occur by the next halvening in 2020 at the latest.  By mid 2021 I expect a price north of $100k usd. 
@_date: 2018-09-19 15:37:04
I am happy we agree on this point. Now let’s explore that for a second.  My belief is that the floor is around $5.8k and is gradually rising as hodlers continue to accumulate.   
I think this quasi-stability will eventually instill confidence in new money to take a chance on bitcoin.  This will snowball us to heights greater than $8k in the next 6 months (with or without an etf). 
@_date: 2018-09-19 17:52:40
Especially if it goes up 10-15x within 3 years of purchase. 
@_date: 2018-09-08 21:30:38
A rally is still possible Q4.  VanEck etf decision and Bakkt launch in November could be the spark needed.  If the etf gets delayed on sept 30th then we may have to wait a few more months. 
This is a golden opportunity that accumulate at cheap prices

The slow rise needs to go on for months, not days.   That’s how bitcoin crawled out of hell in 2015-2016. 
Regrettably, I see no quicker way out unless some miracle happens with the VanEck etf or Bakkt.  
@_date: 2018-09-05 14:10:01
Like I said, Goldman Sachs may well be the biggest troll in Bitcoin Land. 
 While bitcoin would enjoy more rapid gains from institutional investment, it does not need it to prosper.  We can easily reach a new ath with retail speculation alone. 
I am excited about the possibility of approval of the VanEck etf and Bakkt project which are way more significant than a Goldman Sachs trading desk ever could be.

Mt. Gox FUD?  No problem.  If the market crashes in February (which I doubt), I will be ready to buy whole coins.   The market will recover by the halvening in 2020.  I can wait for moon until then.   
In a way, for hardcore believers, a crash like that would be the best thing that could happen to us, because even the investor buying small amounts could become rich.  It might be like 2014 all over again.  It could be our second chance.

In the post you are referring to I said there was high probability of the boost happening in 2 hours because that’s when the lines visually looked like they would cross(upon the days close).  The two hours elapsed and the lines were still close to just touching.  If you look at the posts I made all week a fair minded person would understand that the boost was predicted to happen upon the lines crossing.  
But you are obviously not very fair minded.

I don’t trust the government or fdic if things go really south.  However if Bitcoin becomes widely adopted and I put my money in bitcoin I can reasonably expect the value of my money to rise over the long term.  I’d rather choose bitcoin.

The other variable that was not in play last time was that this is prime vacation time in the USA. So perhaps the bulls are on vaca.

I went all in starting at 11k and dca my way down.  My portfolio (including alts) is down by 50%.  I’m a firm believer in the tech so I will hold to zero if need be, because I see this at $100k in 2021. 
I just get the feeling we are in for another prolonged bear market although I’m hoping I’m wrong.  I’m looking for glimpses of hope that the bear will be short lived.

@_date: 2018-08-06 19:41:46
I think that’s because you don’t fully understand the technology and it’s value once it catches on. 
You seem to be looking at bitcoin just as an investment vehicle to make money.  There is a reason bitcoin keeps bubbling and dropping over and over again and somehow always end up higher year over year. 
You are missing the big picture 
@_date: 2018-09-19 14:11:53
You are likely still up by at least 6x since then.  You lasted all the way through 2015 and we haven’t even been in this bear market 9 months.  You know bitcoin is cyclical so I’m not sure why your hands are feeling weak.  
@_date: 2018-08-14 18:35:48

So at what price will bitcoinalways wake up? I say $7200
@_date: 2018-08-30 13:50:49
Theory;  It’s end of summer in the USA. Many bulls �� are on vacation right now, are optimistic long term, and not paying close attention to the price.  
Bears �� on the other hand are pessimistic and are constantly watching the price because they are scared or are opportunistic shorters. They have no life and are always watching price and don’t take vacations.  
Maybe that’s why price is dumping despite TA that suggest the price should be increasing above the $7100 line since the short term moving average was just about to cross the long term moving average on the Cb pro one day chart.  This is usually an indicator that a pump is imminent. 
That and possibly the Koreans are shorting now that Bithumb is finally back online.   
@_date: 2018-08-30 18:34:11
I believe so, but bear markets take time to play out.  With bitcoin you have to be prepared to hold long term (years) before seeing your moon.

Who’s making posts like this?   To the best of my knowledge, this is the first time since April that I’ve made any such statement on short term price based on TA. And last time I was absolutely correct.   
You were just looking for a chance, any chance, to call me out.  
Edit:  oh and furthermore I didn’t even say “bull run”. I said price boost. There’s a huge difference.

@_date: 2018-08-13 14:12:40
Too close for comfort for me. I’d like to see us at least 8k. 
@_date: 2018-08-29 18:35:24
That’s how we got to $8400 last month. Price speculation due to the imminent decision of the VanEck etf   
I am suggesting this will happen again in September (may already have started) leading up to the September 30th decision.  People will hedge their bets and lock in their bitcoin just in case it gets approved.  
@_date: 2018-08-29 23:12:05
See here:  
@_date: 2018-08-06 15:50:03
They have until March 4, 2019 to decide. 
I just look at it as more time to accumulate. 
Right now the average retail investor can realistically buy at least one whole bitcoin if they really try for it. Once the etf gets approved that goal will become harder and harder to achieve. 
@_date: 2018-08-29 17:55:51
It really isn’t hard. Most people just don’t know where to start.  They want to feel secure that they aren’t sending their money to a scammer or fraudulent site.    
I started on Coinbase and felt relatively safe.  Then I learned about Gemini.  IMO these are the safest for newbies.  Coinbase is very simple to use.  I think both are as trustworthy as you can get. 
The wallets do need to improve and must become absolutely idiot proof.   It should become nearly impossible to send money to the wrong address.  Maybe need multiple verifications before sending. I’m not sure the best solution but someone will invent it. 
Edit:  we need to start seeing commercials for Coinbase/Gemini on tv and on banner ads for mainstream sites.  Marketing, Marketing, Marketing.  Need to make it really simple and inviting for the masses. 
@_date: 2018-08-08 13:34:07
Some of you may recall a few months ago I suggested everyone put aside some fiat for a “bitcoin emergency fund” just in case.  If you did that you are in a good position to get some cheap coins right now.   It may not be so cheap for long. 
@_date: 2018-08-29 20:44:09
It may drop again on September 30th depending on etf decision. However until then we will probably rise (give or take)
@_date: 2018-08-12 17:26:37
I’m not sure about your facts, but I agree with you in spirit. 
@_date: 2018-08-31 11:42:01
I disagree a little with your TA rant. I have seen TA act as a fairly reliable indicator of short term price action when the moving averages cross. It may be that bots and some humans are watching for these indicators and acting accordingly, which creates a self-fulfilling prophecy.  
So it seems foolish to entirely dismiss these indicators. 
@_date: 2018-08-03 11:51:41
I don’t think so. It bounced back quickly from that before dropping again to these levels. 
Many people believe the cboe etf has better chances of being approved soon due to its different makeup. 
@_date: 2018-08-09 00:11:01
I cede that fact, but it will not save you from massive loss due to opportunity cost in 2019, 2020 and 2021, since if you don’t buy a ticket you can’t win. 
Maybe you’ll change your mind after it breaks 12k

Crypto in decline?  Are you kidding me?  We are just at the beginning. 
Universities are offering classes in crypto.  While the hype has cooled for now due to the bear market, the interest is there from the younger generation, and they will be the ones ushering us into our crypto future on a mass scale.
**Cornell offers more crypto classes than any other top university in the world**
When it comes to crypto and higher education, Cornell University is not just leading the Ivy League: It offers more blockchain-related courses than any other top university in the world, according to a survey by digital asset exchange Coinbase and researcher Qriously Technologies.
And crypto mania has been particularly pronounced among young people: Yale economist Robert Schiller noted last year that he could sense the excitement for bitcoin among his students. However, he also said the mania was a good example of a financial bubble, and crypto classes are not included in the Nobel prize winner’s course offerings, according to his faculty webpage.
And many of these students will become serious buyer/HODLers as the get out into the real world and start making real money.
**Bitcoin Survey Suggests Bright Future For Cryptocurrency**
Bitcoin could be in for a boost with U.S. students twice as likely as the country’s average to own cryptocurrency, a survey by Coinbase and carried out by researchers Qriously has revealed.
With 18 percent of U.S. student respondents saying said they own (or have owned) bitcoin or some other cryptocurrency, twice the rate of the general population, it suggests bitcoin ownership and adoption could be about to rise.
Before that, a much younger internet, back in the 1980s, was predominantly used by students, academics and universities to share research before it was later commercialized.

u/manbrodudeguy just couldn’t pass up the opportunity to jump all over me when I made a bad TA call yesterday. Big friggin’ deal, I’ve also been right a lot too.  It’s very difficult if not impossible to predict short term price movement. I did the best I could with the tools available at the time.  The TA was screaming that a pump was imminent.  So I said the probability of a pump was high due to that reason and laid out my argument.  I never said it was a certainty.  I still think we’ll see bullish activity in September leading up to VanEck etf decision.  That is not TA.

This one has a better chance of approval because it has insurance. Backed by cboe and they have more credibility with the SEC. many people believe even if it is delayed that it will eventually be approved by the final March 2019 deadline. This would definitely be a major boost to the price because it would open the door for more etfs later on.

Good odds that the cboe etf will be approved.  This will be a nice boost to the price:
“The four people I still talk to on the daily at the SEC are basically telling me this ‘it is going to get approved but we are going to make the markets understand that we dug really, really deep i.e. investor protection/transparency’. And that makes sense. The vast majority of the public still has no idea what ‘digital assets’ are or what it means. So when you do an approval like this, and the successive approvals that will follow in this asset class – think of the 3-5 year return number that will be associated with this market? And maybe that is the key to the Van Eck SolidX approval? It is set up as an accredited investor vehicle. That singular element is probably what gives so many of us a firm belief in its approval. And it is a stroke of genius by the Van Eck SolidX group.”

After every major bitcoin crash the people that remain are the hardcore hodlers who are still accumulating.  Many new ones were created during the latest crash. I am one of them, and there are many more like me taking advantage of this buying opportunity.

The thing that irks me about you, besides the endless repetition, is that you act like bitcoin bubbles and crashes are a brand new phenomenon.  It has happened many times in Bitcoin history and always bounces back much higher next time. 
IMO the latest bitcoin bubble has already popped. We are near the bottom now. How long that bottom lasts, nobody knows. But to act like we’re going to keep crashing down to nonsensical levels and ignoring logarithmic trend is just an insult to our intelligence.

High probability of price boost in approximately 2 hours 
Edit 1:
2 hour update:  ema12 line just barely crossed the ema26 line on cb pro one day chart. I may have jumped the gun.  Not much of a reaction yet.  We may have to wait another 24 hours to see  an effect. 
Thus, let’s be prepared for highly probably boost at approximately 8/31/18. 00:00 UTC time when the lines cross with more conviction. 
Edit 2: 
Oh, by the way, it may boost anytime between now and then as well. 
Edit 3:
10 hr update:  Well I’m just gonna admit now this was a bad call.   The variable I did not consider this time was how time of year might affect price action.  End of August is prime vacation time in the USA and it may be the case that some of the bulls are in vacation mode and not paying close attention to price. 
I’m no expert by far, but I have been watching price action for the last 6 months and have found the crossing of the moving averages to be a fairly reliable indicator of short term action.   As I showed back in April we had a huge rally after the moving averages crossed on the one day chart.  But it also happens to a much smaller degree when the averages cross on the 6hr, 1hr, and 15 min chart. 
I find it interesting that as soon as the lines started to cross this time all of a sudden we have a large dump. Could be shorters just taking advantage of the buying vacuum.   Very strange price action. 
Now with price dropping, the moving averages may not fully cross and ema12 may drop back below ema26.  We’ll see. I still say September is going to be bullish leading up to the VanEck etf decision.   But of course, this is bitcoin and anything is possible. 
@_date: 2018-08-20 14:56:19

Just my own thoughts this time:
Human emotions cause us to think short term. We must fight that urge by understanding what has happened before. 
Real people were going through these same FUD-laden emotions 4 years ago.  Many of the ones who overcame those feelings are now rich.
Some are hanging out on the beach right now in Barbados or Tahiti enjoying life. 
Or in Thailand getting laid by beautiful women every night. 
They no longer care about what happens on Reddit because they are having too much fun!
These people have reached Crypto Nirvana. 
&amp;nbsp; 
Well, that could be us in a few years too. 
Those newly minted crypto millionaires/billionaires may invite their old friends onto their yachts for a mid-summer cruise ��.  Their friends ask them, how the hell did you get so rich?  Weren’t you in IT help desk?  Then s/he answers.... Bitcoin.
Instantly a few new Hodlers have been created.  And they will tell others, who will tell others... ad infinitum. 
Anecdotally, something like this (less dramatically) happened to me and that is how I learned about bitcoin.
The growth of bitcoin will continue.  Keep the faith!

Thanks.  I’m just beginning to feel my way around tradingview. I’m also toying with an extremely simple linear model that just looks at the organic growth 2015 to 2016, without factoring in the new buyers/hodlers since 2017  (parabolic growth period). This growth trend approximately models a doubling in price every year. 
So if 2017 never happened we’d be around a $3,500 floor, minimum, by this fall.  Since we have obviously acquired a lot of new buyers accumulating since 2017, the floor has to be significantly higher.  5.8k floor seems conservative.

It’s a start.  If you are buying small amounts like that (or any amounts for that matter) a tip to avoid paying fees is to fund your Coinbase account with usd first. Takes about a week for ach transfer. Then move the funds to their sister exchange GDAX.  buy your crypto there with no fees.  ��
Edit:   To get no fees you use limit buy/sell orders.  Not market orders as those have fees.

There is almost zero chance of corruption with bitcoin. It is an immutable ledger backed up by math.  Protected by a vast network of good nodes (miners).   Far superior to any fiat that governments control.

If you are worried or scared that bitcoin will fail you are wrong and in bitcoin for the wrong reason.
u/apollojmr - 4 years ago
This is not a get rich quick scheme. It has indeed made many millionaires but mostly by accident. The people that have made a lot of money off of bitcoin have done so because they kept the faith and not invested in bitcoin to get rich but rather invested because they truly believe in the system and what it stands for. Bitcoin is not an investment, stock or a way to get rich. Bitcoin is a huge technological breakthrough that is a solution to a lot of problems in the tech world and it makes a lot of things easier. I am a firm believer that if you stop worrying about the price and start worrying about how to incorporate it within the already defunct system, that you will be lucky along the way and witness a spike that will allow you to cash in on your loyalty and patience. I can remember a day when I thought spending $20 a coin was a huge risk. I wish I would have known then what I know now. But then that is the way things work that we truly believe in. I am dealing with a friend that invested $20k back when they were at the $266 spike and then they dropped he was mad. However when they went up to $1200 he was happy. Now even though he bought in at $266 he feels like hes lost lately with the downslide. Just like before I told him to have patience and believe and it will be alright. Just as I am telling you all the same. Bitcoin is not going anywhere. Stay tuned.
And then a Doubting Thomas:
Scared newby here. Doesn't know if I should sell or not.
u/marisam7 - 2 years ago
I know people are saying to not panic and that the price will come back but I don't have the patience to wait 4 years for it to come back to 750$
I was reading a coinbase article from 2014 saying that all the experts say in two years bitcoin will be worth 10 k per coin. Now I see those people are wrong in the past and I just want to know if they are wrong now.
In short is bitcoin still going to reach a grand by the end of the year?
By contrast, a brave soul:
I'm still not scared
u/scurvyscallywag - 2 years ago
So I was here to laugh after finding out why Bitcoin's price fell. Bratty developer can't handle reality. I found this old post I made.
I'm not going to go into my returns but I continued making larger purchases into the price decline as low as $220 per Bitcoin. These purchases were all unloaded during the recent spike to $500.
Buy when others are fearful and sell when others are optimistic. Just like last time, I'm here to let you know these are good prices and I'm not scared.
Last time I was here I was posting about buying 15 Bitcoin when most people here were panicing and saying "are you buying the dip?!?" trying to call everyone out as if no one is actually buying Bitcoin.
If you bought in when I made that post Bitcoin was at $400, Sept 18, 2014. A year and 1 month later Bitcoin hit $500, a return of 20% annualized, and that doesn't include buying all the way down as low as $167 where you could have gotten 300% returns.
So, I'll be buying again as soon as I can (no liquidity atm) and in another year or so I'll come back and make another post showing how $370 was a great time to buy in again.
Don't say people don't tell you how to make money. ;) I understand this volatility scares the shit out of people though.
Don’t forget to read the replies to each of these. There is some gold in there. 
So, hang in there HODLers!

Do you use credit cards to purchase things?  Guess what, they charge your merchant fees every time.    You think the merchant doesn’t pass those extra fees onto the customers through higher prices?  Of course they do.  It used to be obvious when buying gas.  Now many have same price cash/credit advertising. Doesn’t matter since everyone pays more. Cash users end up subsidizing credit users.    
Crypto fees will become more and more competitive with credit card fees and as more people switch to paying with crypto, prices of goods  will adjust downwards accordingly.  Merchants may even offer discounts initially for crypto users.   Bright future ahead boys.

I’m no expert by far, but I have been watching price action for the last 6 months and have found the crossing of the moving averages to be a fairly reliable indicator of short term action.   As I showed back in April we had a huge rally after the moving averages crossed on the one day chart.  But it also happens to a much smaller degree when the averages cross on the 6hr, 1hr, and 15 min chart. 
I find it interesting that as soon as the lines started to cross this time all of a sudden we have a large dump. Very strange

Price jumps suddenly with a big green candle/dildo pissing off the bears.  Then stays choppy with small up and down oscillations for a while creating small spikes. Then it suddenly drops with a big red dildo leaving many bulls butt hurt.   The end result looks like Bart Simpson’s head.  
There is also the upside down bart pattern which is the the reverse of the above.

Give it up.  Bottom was at or close to $5.8k.  Any attempt by shorters to artificially push it down below 5.8k is highly likely to get quickly gobbled up by bulls and bring it back above $6k in short order. Eventually the mainstream investor and media will come to the same conclusion and then we go up. 
@_date: 2018-08-06 20:43:40

Road to Recovery - Part 1
In this miniseries we will explore how the bitcoin market recovered after the crash of 2014. 
To recognize when a recovery is occurring it is helpful to figure out when we’ve hit bottom.  I think we are close to the floor and may have already hit it on June 24, 2018 when price was $ 5,826.41. 
If you look at the chart of bitcoin over the past few years you can clearly see the long term trend upwards.  Note the linear regression channel.  We are currently in the lower end of the regression band.  Every time the price goes below $6,000 there is strong buying pressure which sends it quickly back above $6k.  I think the bull market of 2017 has minted a lot of new hardcore HODLers who are continuously accumulating.  Combined with the barebones cost of mining, we are seeing a floor that gradually rises. 
Now let’s begin our journey back to late 2015 as the market just started to show glimpses of recovery:
Katie Elizabeth Charm had this to say on October 25, 2015:
Mood was becoming more optimistic again after almost 2 years of pain:
u/phanpp - 2y
28 October 2015 bitcoin reached $300 after a long long hiatus. Boy did I cheer then. $400 now - Ho Hum. Maybe worth cheering again at $600. No, make that $1000
u/phanpp• 2y
Just my way of saying that bitcoin is a success and if you just hold the price will keep going up - nothing magical
Some historical perspective:
The truly defining Post-MtGox moments when Bitcoin turned from Bearish to Bullish
This will be true again:
Bitcoin: The Rise and Fall or There and Back Again
And, as analysts has predicted, Bitcoin will easily take the next milestone — $10,000 — at the end of this year or in the beginning of the next one! So, no matter how jerky Bitcoin is a lot of people would like to take a bite out of its crypto-yumminess! Those who have passed on that treat will bite their nails later. Even if you want to buy, say, a giant rubber duck.
In a few years you can buy MANY — due to the enormous growth of Bitcoin!
Finally, I will leave you with this for today:

I have no doubt it will rebound eventually.  My doubt is regarding how long it will be before the next bull run.   I dread the real possibility that it could last as long as the 2014 one (two years).  
I am hoping for a faster end to the bear this time.
I consider myself a true HODLer, but I have always admitted I am an impatient one.

@_date: 2018-05-09 14:07:47
I strongly caution anyone doing this to only day trade a small percentage of your stack. I only do 10% for fun. 
Think how you would feel if you sell a lot of your stack at the tip and then all of a sudden a giant green dildo appears and the price jumps over 1k (it just happened a few weeks ago). Then you miss out.  With institutional investors getting ready to jump on the train this could happen unpredictably and the jumps could be even more dramatic.

@_date: 2018-05-04 15:50:44
I agree. Right now it is a really great investment opportunity. After it gets above 100k territory I think it becomes only a good investment opportunity.  The higher it goes above that number the greater the mass adoption.  It will become more and more stable as we get closer to one million and people will be more comfortable spending it knowing the value will not fluctuate much in the short term.   It will continue to increase in value above one million but it will be a more gradual process.

@_date: 2018-05-19 14:20:39
To avoid any fees:  Open account with coinbase and get verified.  Ach transfer money from your bank account to there (takes about a week).  Then log into gdax using your coinbase login (affiliated with coinbase) and place a limit buy order (no fees).  If you do a market buy instead, there are fees. 
If you don’t want to wait a week then you can just buy on coinbase right away and pay fees.  Gemini is another option.

Freedom to be your own bank and fully control your own financial destiny.  I have a strong libertarian bent, so Bitcoin resonates with me.  Sure I want to be rich as a result of my price speculation, but it is more than that to me.

Not for the consumers’ sake, for their (merchant) sake.  If the next guy is charging less to attract customers using crypto he’ll get more customers.  Merchant wins. Customer wins.  The merchant that doesn’t adapt loses.  The transaction fees for some crypto right now are almost 0.   Hopefully they’ll figure out how to get bitcoin fees that low, or we’ll probably be using an altcoin for buying coffee.

I posted this in yesterday's daily before it closed, but I want to make sure everyone has a chance to read this.
I found this thread from 4 years ago.  It feels like we could be having this conversation today under our current circumstances.  Similar FUD, concerns and hopes.  I really think 4 years from now people will be looking back on our threads and wishing they had a chance to get on board the bitcoin train in 2018 when the price dipped.  Thanks to bitcoin's scarcity and the fact that there can be no more than 21 million coins, ever, I firmly believe we will see the price of bitcoin continue to grow substantially in the years to come.
Edit:  p.s. the OP in that thread is probably rich beyond his wildest dreams today.   So in other words, it’s not too late for us either.

What stage of Cryptocurrency adoption are we in?
Innovators (2.5%) - I think this was between 2009 - spring of 2017
Early Adopters (13.5%)  - summer 2017 to present.   I think we are still in this stage.  Do you agree?
Early Majority (34%) - maybe begins when price breaks 75k.  Early adopters finally got their family members to invest.  To the moon!!! 
Late Majority (34%) - price breaks 300k. People start to use it regularly as currency. 
Laggards (16%) - price breaks 1 million. Almost everyone knows about bitcoin and many are actively using it.

Price speculation leading up to the VanEck etf decision will see price rise.   Plus I think it is becoming clearer that we saw bottom around $5.8k.  
Anyone shorting now is taking a huge risk.  Better to wait until after sept 30th.  Or better yet, don’t be a shorter ��

The comments below, from 2 years ago, resonate with me.  We don't need a time machine to see into the future, sometimes we just need to reflect on the past.

Sounds to me like you’ll be able to buy coffee at Starbucks with bitcoin this fall.
Yes, I know they will not directly be holding the bitcoin, but you as the customer will be paying with bitcoin and then their Bakkt service, similar to bitpay, will convert it to USD for Starbucks.  This is a step in the right direction and will increase exposure of bitcoin to the normies. 
If Starbucks puts a “bitcoin accepted here” sign in its windows this fall, that is definitely going to be good for bitcoin ™

There is still too much circulating bitcoin controlled by whales (their splashing creates a lot of volatility).  As little fishes like me continue to buy small amounts it gets more distributed. 
Btw a lot of people do use bitcoin in transactions. I use it often to purchase things online. As lightning network grows this will improve as well.
@_date: 2019-11-22 19:30:09

@_date: 2018-10-13 01:32:23
Nope.  You have to just prepare yourself that a bull market might not happen until 2020 (halvening). The price will have nowhere to go but up.  If it happens sooner then great. Just accumulate for now and be thankful you have this chance to make a fortune in a few years. 
@_date: 2018-10-01 15:54:19
Yeah that’s what I’m thinking.  There just seems like too much resistance otherwise.  
@_date: 2018-10-01 19:49:49
Yeah, that’s part of the problem. Even if Bakkt is the panacea for Bitcoin in the near to mid term, if the public doesn’t even know about it then we may not see much of a price reaction for a long time. 
In order to have it be the spark that ignites another bull run we would probably need massive media attention about it.  Even then, how many people are actually paying attention to any news these days, let alone bitcoin news.  People are so distracted by trivial matters ... it is pretty sad. 
@_date: 2018-10-11 01:32:17

Heh. We’re all taking a risk here aren’t we?
@_date: 2018-10-13 13:44:24
I wouldn’t exactly call it wild speculation. If you look at the long term logarithmic chart it has us over the $100k mark before my deadline.  There are so many new variables being introduced (Bakkt, etfs, Lightning network) that could possibly take the price even higher.  So while it is not a guarantee, some would say my prediction is too low. 
@_date: 2019-11-27 18:35:57
When I first heard about bitcoin in December 2017, I knew nothing about it at all.  I was freaked out that I missed out on the opportunity of a lifetime. 
After a short while, I realized I’m not too late. We’re still near the beginning of this incredible history-making journey.

I paused on trading many months ago when I realized it was not a winning strategy for Bitcoin. Maybe if we get some $1000 point swings again I’ll jump back in for some more punishment.  Hodling is really the best policy tho. 
@_date: 2018-10-01 15:06:59

@_date: 2018-10-29 18:44:14
Nonsense!  HODling may not have been the optimal strategy the last year but it has been over the long term unless you are an expert (or lucky) trader.   I consider myself a fairly intelligent person but I still got burned trying to day trade bitcoin.  
If you have been hodling since the beginning of 2017 you are still up 6x. 
Look at the logarithmic chart. Facts don’t lie.

Sure there is action there, if all you care about is hearing people announce when they’re opening long and short positions all day long.

He typically only shows up immediately after a big drop in price to give his idiotic theory more weight.  
My skeptical mind wonders if he does this not only to prove his TA is accurate, but to try to influence more people to sell so that it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. Bitcoin has been too stable lately so he must be trolling somewhere else.

As I have proposed repeatedly over the last few months, I think bitcoin bottomed at around $5.8k. We seem to have now entered a period of Flattening.  No one knows how long this sideways action will last before the next bull run starts. 
While we wait (and accumulate ��), here are some fun facts about Bitcoin you may not be aware of and price predictions from the biggest bitcoin bulls and bears:
Did you know that only 8% of Americans own Bitcoin, and of those who don’t have some, another 8% plan to buy?  We are just getting started ladies and gentlemen.

As The Flattening continues, we should remain vigilant on important bitcoin news.  There are so many positive things in the works right now, it is absolutely stunning that the price is still so low.  The news that a major institution such as Fidelity is going all in on crypto next year is a very big deal.  Also Bakkt is one of the most exciting things to happen for bitcoin in years and it's launching very soon!

I didn’t even read your whole post because it’s so ridiculous. Hindsight is 20/20.  If you were investing for the long term (years) like me then this bear market means nothing, because it’s temporary.  Back earlier this year when people were yelling HODL, we were trying to prevent an irrational bear market from taking hold. We lost. However, the market could very well have turned around faster than anyone expected, so hodling could have been a good idea even in the short term.  Again if you are not a daytrader, but instead are a long term investor than HODLING has been proven to be the right strategy during bitcoin’s 9 year track record. And I believe this will continue to be true in the years to come.

One of the things you mentioned is currently a real pita - recording transactions for capital gains purposes.  
Right now, I manually import all transactions into my Bitcoin.tax account. So I am relying on this site to calculate capital gains and generate the necessary forms for tax preparation, all for a reasonable annual fee.  I just consider it an extra cost of tax prep. Not really that much effort as it would be if I tried to do this from scratch with spreadsheets. 
It would be nice if I could get the API to easily and automatically upload all transactions from exchanges and my wallets to my tax account without any involvement from me. Maybe this is already possible and I am not aware.  This would alleviate this main inconvenience that I think is a hurdle to mainstream adoption. 
Better yet, how can we get the government to change its stance on tax treatment of bitcoin entirely?  The USD is not subject to capital gains. If bitcoin is a currency, then why shouldn’t it be treated similarly to the USD?

I also got in late - January 2018 sitting on some fat losses but mitigated by some lucky altcoin gains. 
I am waiting for at least 100k bitcoin to take some profits to pay off some debt. Then I plan to hodl all the way until this thing is in the 300k range or higher (~ five years in my prediction). 
Hopefully at that price point adoption and lightning network will be a lot better and maybe there will not be much of a need to “cash out”.  The ultimate goal would be to pay for everything with crypto.

I’ve been thinking it might be a good idea for a lot of us to take a break from watching the price and subs constantly for a few months.  It can be toxic in here around these times.  The fudsters and nocoiners come out of the woodwork in full force to try to bring down morale.  
Best strategy is to go out and enjoy life and keep buying the coins when you can.  Don’t worry, it will get better.  Too much money and brainpower has gone into bitcoin and the entire cryptocurrency movement.

Daily Hopium:
I bet this guy regrets the decision he made five years ago:
I don't want to screw anyone, but I have to get off this ride. When this post is two hours old I'm selling off &gt;800 BTC
I really believe in the future of BTC, I invested nearly all of my life savings in it, and after MUCH soul searching I realised I have to get off this crazy ride. Fortunately if the current price holds I'm not losing too much, but I can't afford to risk any further losses. I NEED to convert back to standard currency. I've made a fool of myself, cost me and my family too much because of my greed and delusions, and I'm at the point where I have to cut and run.
This community has been great and although I haven't participated I've lurked a long time and have been staggered by the willingness of people to put their money where their mouth is to change the world for the better. I'm really sorry to do this, but I have no choice but to sell off &gt;8000 BTC which may be enough to spark another panic sell off. I don't want you, my fellow to be left holding devalued BTC so to clear my conscience I'm giving this community a few hours warning.
I will begin my sell-off at 0500 GMT, which will lower the price significantly. If you plan to get off this crazy ride anytime soon you may like to consider doing so before then, or be prepared to hold your BTC for the long haul. Please upvote this post for visibility (I recieve no karma for this self post) but I would appreciate it if you don't blog, twitter, or share this outside of the community. I want to give my fellow redditors a chance to sell but I don't want to crash the market before I do. Please keep it within reddit, thanks.
Please accept my deepest apologies for what I am about to do to the bitcoin market.
e: I can't change the title, it was meant to be &gt;8000

I think we need it to be in the hands of many more people for price stability to ultimately occur.  As a byproduct, bitcoin’s limited supply would create a scarcity over time and the price would rise.  Once enough people are holding and using it regularly price will stabilize and individual whales will no longer be able to manipulate the price such as we are seeing happen right now.

No.  The majority of the world will only own a small fraction of a bitcoin.  We, the early adopter hodlers, will be the rich ones holding many millions of dollars of bitcoin each. 
It will be different from the current fiat system in many ways. One of my favorite ways is that the system itself cannot be tampered with.  Once the last of the 21 million coins is mined, no new bitcoin can magically be created like how fiat money is just printed at the will of government.

Difference is when bitcoin sinks it miraculously rises from the depths every single time.  I don’t care how much power Soros, Dimon, and Gates have. They cannot stop a decentralized platform like bitcoin.  As long as we stubborn holders keep buying up the cheap coins, the power transfers from them to us, bitcoin by bitcoin.  We’re the good guys who want a brighter future through the blockchain. They’re the bad guys trying to stop the inevitable to preserve their power and wealth.  They will lose in time.  They should jump onboard with us and be winners.  Mark my words within 3 years bitcoin will be at least 100k each.

“Everyone knows”?  That’s presumptuous. 
According to McAfee (who is not only inventor of his famed antivirus, but also a trained mathematician) his prediction is based on the several different mathematical models which all arrived at the same conclusion of &gt; 1 million per bitcoin by dec 2020.  The mining cost model you cited was just one of them and whether or not it will come true is debatable. 
I’m not well studied on Tim draper’s methodology, so I will look into it further, but his number seems more feasible to me.   Adoption as a currency will happen in due time. Lightning network will help as it grows.  What is really needed is a killer user interface wallet/exchange that is idiot proof.  Once we have that, adoption will flourish.

Of course not. But combine that with the long term trend history and it is more likely than not that the trend will continue. 
The fundamentals are still strong. Lightning network came out this year and is slowly but surely being implemented.   Anything worthwhile is going to take time. This is still a new industry.

With over 300 million in Venture Capital Funding for Bitcoin, all the new innovations and big players about to move in from the wall street and the start ups we don't even know about yet that are being worked on. I feel like everyone is playing hush hush, and one morning we all will wake up to a huge media blitz on how bitcoins being traded for over 1000 on the stock markets and other country's are joining the band wagon and push it up to 2,000. There's so many people in high places that have invested into Bitcoin that they would be able to push it mainstream to get back there money, just a matter of when.

In my uneducated opinion, it is very unlikely to hold for a long period of time at stable prices. Investors are terrified of bear markets as they don't want to see their money shrink. But as soon as the bear market finishes- and there is stability- the fear will disappear and investors will rush in. As soon as they start to do this, signs of a bull market will appear, causing even more investors to rush in, creating a virtuous circle (for those of us who got in before anyway), causing the next in a long line of bubbles.
@_date: 2018-06-14 01:39:25
Not true.  Most people I know in the real world (outside Reddit) never heard of bitcoin. And the few that do know have no real clue about how it works or that there are other cryptocurrency choices.   Despite the media coverage last year, many people just don’t know.  A lot of people to reach still.

My reply got hidden for some reason. Trying again.  Mods if you are deleting this for some reason kindly message me why. Thanks
Combination of several items:
These bulls can explain it better than I ...
Google the following (as mods won't let me post links apparently):
Tom Lee predicts bitcoin to be 25k by end of 2018
John Mcafee predicts bitcoin to be 15k by end of July 2018
The Mcafee Dickline almost gets us to 30k by end of 2018 and one million by end of 2020
Tim Draper predicts bitcoin will be 250k by 2022
There are many price predictions above 25k for 2018  
Finally, a look at the logarithmic chart shows a clear path up on the long term:[
Not out of the question we could be above 30k by year end.  Remember, we have just endured a brutal \\\~ 6 month bear market.  Sooner or later it will come to an end and the bull market will resume.  When it does, it's going to surprise a lot of people.

Might as well sell now while there is still a bid in the market. Those holding out for higher prices are going to go down with the sinking ship.
Since Bitcoin is like a fervent religion we'll get to see many people relentless holding on and dollar cost averaging all the way down to their grave.

Yep, exactly what to do.
The best advice I could give you is to ONLY cash out if you absolutely need the money. Bitcoin is going mainstream, there's going to be a higher demand for the coin, and because of the limited amount it can only rise in value. Just wait, you'll get your return.
My friend bought in the day before the crash early this year, at 120$ per coin, it dropped to 60$ per coin, and within a few months he was up to 250$ per coin and sold them on to me. I luckily bought the day before the massive price surge, and they quadrupled in a week.

Here is one definition of:
“Rent-seeking is an individual's or entity's use of company, organizational or individual resources to obtain economic gain without reciprocating any benefits to society through wealth creation. An example of rent-seeking is when a company lobbies the government for loan subsidies, grants or tariff protection.”
Wrong. Besides material pursuits, my primary desire for becoming rich is so that I don’t have to work my menial day job anymore.  My true passion is physics and invention and if I were able to devote my entire day to that instead of a bullshit desk job, i believe I could contribute far more to the world and maybe if I’m smart and lucky enough generate more wealth and prosperity into the world than I individually consume.

And one can argue the value of a bitcoin is derived partially from the cost to mine one.  It takes a real expenditure of machine and electricity to produce one bitcoin.

“Everyone knows”?  That’s presumptuous. 
According to McAfee (who is not only inventor of his famed antivirus, but also a trained mathematician) his prediction is based on the several different mathematical models which all arrived at the same conclusion of &gt; 1 million per bitcoin by dec 2020.  The mining cost model you cited was just one of them and whether or not it will come true is debatable. 
I’m not well studied on Tim draper’s methodology, so I will look into it further, but his number seems more feasible to me.   Adoption as a currency will happen in due time. Lightning network will help as it grows.  What is really needed is a killer user interface wallet/exchange that is idiot proof.  Once we have that, adoption will flourish.

Don’t believe in prophecy, believe in maths.
Bitcoin price follows a logarithmic growth curve. Thus, it increases rapidly in the beginning and tapers off as time goes on.  That’s why it takes longer to see the same percentage gains today compared to when bitcoin first came out.
We are in the 4th growth cycle of bitcoin right now, which will accelerate once the bitcoin halvening occurs in May 2020. If history repeats, it should reach at least $100k before it peaks and we enter the next long bear cycle (maybe we’ll get lucky this time and it won’t!)
Conditions will continue to be turbulent for a while, so just buckle up, stack sats, and hold on tight. You won’t get hurt on Mr. Satoshi’s wild ride unless you jump off.  Good luck! ��

Forgive me, I didn’t think that was a serious question, since if you look at my post history virtually ever other post is me trying to lay out that exact argument.  Must I rehash all of my points for the last five months doing that just for you?  Pay attention. 
I will say just this.   Look at the price chart since 2010.  this is a bubble just like many before that have come and gone in bitcoins history.  There is too much money, brainpower and energy that has gone into bitcoin for this bubble to be any different.  I will be proven right. You will see.

Daily hopium:
“People think they're ready for the drops because they've seen them in the price history. Then they get 5 months of bad news, and they're ready to abandon ship. We've heard many, many calls for the death of bitcoin, and the ecosystem didn't have 1/10th the capability it has now.
The price dropped from $38 to $2 for a reason: people thought they would be totally worthless. The price dropped from $250 to $90 because people thought it would be totally worthless. Now people are realizing again, "hey it really could be totally worthless". Same type of people get shaken out each time - weak hands.
It ain't a sure thing, but the stakes are huge. If you bought in at $1000, I'm sorry for your paper losses. But if there's a 10% chance this thing could have the market cap of gold, it's worth the risk to me to keep a small portion of my assets in the protocol.
I believe in the mission, I believe in the math, and I believe in the ecosystem. And it's been one hell of a ride. I'm not getting off now just because some bureaucrat in China farted.”

I feel badly for anyone who panic sells, when if they just held the market would likely go up again like it always has in the past.

“While exact troughs are preferable, there is some room to maneuver and usually, a trough within 3% of the previous is considered valid.”
“Although there can be variations, the classic Double Bottom Reversal usually marks an intermediate or long-term change in trend. “
I think we meet or are close to meeting the 3% variation threshold described for the double bottom to be valid.  If this holds and we can break the key resistance, it could be very bullish.

@_date: 2018-06-23 23:43:31
So morbid for a Saturday 
@_date: 2018-06-24 15:16:53
At this early stage of its development there is no stability when it comes to cryptocurrency. 
Bitcoin has been around the longest, has the largest following and name recognition. Strongest security against hacker attack. 
It is the most likely candidate for institutional investment. 
IMO Bitcoin is your best bet if you are a long term investor.  Take a look at the long term logarithmic chart and decide for yourself:
@_date: 2018-06-24 06:44:26
Man you have zero faith in humanity 
@_date: 2018-06-26 20:25:05
I think you need both holders and spenders.  The spenders for liquidity.  The buyers/hodlers help the price maintain its levels and rise.   At this stage, the price rising is needed to draw in more people who are unfamiliar with the technology but are initially interested in price speculation. 
That’s what happened to me.  Someone I knew told me about how they made a lot of money on bitcoin and it drew my attention.  So I invested and started learning all I could about the technology. Now I think it’s a wonderful technology, not just an investment.  I spend it where I can and immediately replace it with new fiat. 
We need more me’s to happen. 
@_date: 2018-06-14 01:45:04
Holy crap is that shortsighted.  Bitcoin is only held by a minuscule percentage of the world’s population.  WE are still early adopters.  Even if you are just starting out with bitcoin today at these prices, there is plenty of opportunity for it to moon and get your Lambo if that’s your desire.

Once it hits your initial target, celebrate and then decide on a certain percentage you will invest in bitcoin moving forward.  Maybe it’s 5% of disposable income each month.

That’s my plan anyway although my percentage will probably be higher. 
@_date: 2018-06-25 03:22:48
Not sure.  I think we get to 100k within 3 years based on price speculation and the next halvening in 2020.  
Eventually I think we get to at least the market share of gold. I have no clue how long that will take, maybe 7-10 years? 
I can see it start being used regularly as an alternate currency at that point as well.
Ultimately I hope it will overcome fiat and become the dominant currency.

For the first time in the history of humanity a currency that is not controlled by any government or powerful entity.  Cannot be inflated like paper fiat currency.  Can never be held back from you during a run on a bank or shutting down of atm machines in a crisis. Billions of dollars can be stored securely in a tiny chip that can rest on a keychain and carried around (unlike gold bars).  Smaller amounts on a bar code on your phone.  Can provide you the freedom to be your own bank in complete control of your own money.  And more...  
The price going up and you getting a lambo should be a pleasant byproduct of early adoption.   Please don’t lose sight of the bigger picture of the revolutionary nature of this technology and how it can benefit you and your children and your grandchildren........

Last I checked it is June 21, 2018
Thanks for playing. 
Edit:  I’m am putting my reply to your statement below here, since my posts keep getting deleted. 
“Everyone knows”?  That’s presumptuous. 
According to McAfee (who is not only inventor of his famed antivirus, but also a trained mathematician) his prediction is based on the several different mathematical models which all arrived at the same conclusion of &gt; 1 million per bitcoin by dec 2020.  The mining cost model you cited was just one of them and whether or not it will come true is debatable. 
I’m not well studied on Tim draper’s methodology, so I will look into it further, but his number seems more feasible to me.   Adoption as a currency will happen in due time. Lightning network will help as it grows.  What is really needed is a killer user interface wallet/exchange that is idiot proof.  Once we have that, adoption will flourish.  
@_date: 2018-06-10 19:48:23
Give me a break.  This happens to bitcoin over and over. It’s been proven the best time to buy is after a large drop.  Bitcoin always bounces back higher in the long run.   The bear market will end and the buyers will reap the rewards while guys like you sell it all and miss out on the gains.

Think about the endgame. If bitcoin reaches 10,000, are you going to get much more utility out of 160000 vs 120000? If it goes to zero, will you kick yourself thinking of what you could've bought today for $1000? Or how much $1000 would be if you put it in the S&amp;P500?

If your intention is to buy something illegal off the dark web with bitcoin, couldn’t you just buy some bitcoin, swap to a privacy coin and make an untraceable transaction to yourself and then finally convert back to bitcoin? Nobody would ever be able to trace it back to the bitcoin you originally purchased from the exchange that way.  It’s a few extra steps, but worth it for absolute anonymity in a situation like that.  And the end result would be you can still pay for the merchandise in bitcoin without fear of being caught.

Just look at the long term logarithmic chart for bitcoin over the past 9 years. We are due for another huge bull run next year to coincide with the halvening.  I expect we will be at $100,000 per bitcoin by mid 2021 at the latest. Probably sooner.   Good luck.

@_date: 2019-02-26 20:52:05
1,000,000 USD / $3,800 per btc ~ 263 btc per wallet 
263 btc * 1.5 million addresses = 394,500,000 btc. 
There are less than 21 million btc in circulation. 
What’s up with your math?
@_date: 2018-06-28 22:36:11
Yup.  They are trying to manipulate us into thinking that somehow this time is different.  It's all b.s.
We are basically the equivalent of the hodlers from 2014.   Hmm let's see, price was around $200 at low point in 2014, and those who were patient saw almost 100x gains from the low by Dec. 2017.
We are the hodlers now in 2018.  Let's say we have some patience and hold for a few years, maybe we'll see 100x gains by then too.
@_date: 2018-06-26 19:15:23
I also believe there is manipulation going on. What I’m not sure about is who’s doing it;
A) professional trading desks getting ready to jump in when price gets low enough 
B) rich whales or whale groups trying to do the same. 
C) governments threatened by crypto trying to drive price low enough to try to kill it off
D) banks doing the same 
E) bill gates or George Soros shorting the market out of spite. 
F) something else ???
There is also probably some normal panic selling still playing out as part of a bear market

Also exchanges may be playing the same game as the trading desks

@_date: 2019-08-28 20:35:55
That’s a lot better than $2 billion ��
@_date: 2019-10-20 00:41:57
I think that is a narrow minded viewpoint. Bitcoin does not have to be used by the dark web to have value.  As a permissionless decentralized store of value that is on an immutable ledger, this has value in itself.  Bitcoin cannot be controlled by anyone or stopped, especially with the advent of decentralized exchanges. Anyway, like I said, you can use bitcoin to buy other privacy coins that you can use for transactions requiring absolute anonymity.
There are plenty of legal use cases right now for bitcoin in the multi billion dollar adult industry as well. Many adult vendors and performers accept bitcoin to purchase subscriptions and content and I can see this expanding to the brick and mortar adult industry (e.g. strip clubs) as well as escort services.
I think overtime we will see more mainstream adoption of bitcoin and other coins as currencies bc there is value to any merchant in saving on all those credit card transaction fees. With lightning network, the merchant fees are almost zero.  This will take time but it is a no brainer from a financial POV with all the wasteful credit card transaction fees.
We are still at the beginning of the bitcoin revolution.  For now, we have to put up with the rollercoaster �� and hopefully make sweet gains.
@_date: 2019-06-28 18:07:57
If bitcoin reaches mass adoption phase think bigger than the market cap of gold.  There is still great potential for gains.
@_date: 2018-06-24 04:06:23

@_date: 2019-06-24 00:47:27
Sounds good to me
@_date: 2019-06-27 16:16:07
Also bitcoin has value because it is a desired and scarce asset  (Only 21 million bitcoins will EVER be produced). Scarcer even than gold.  
Plus it is expensive to produce.  Each new bitcoin that is created costs thousands of dollars in electricity and hardware costs. Compare this to fiat currency which only costs pennies to make.
@_date: 2019-06-26 22:20:01
Bitfi hardware wallet.   Choose a strong pass phrase combined with a SALT and it would take supercomputers millions of years to crack the code (if ever).  IMHO there is no better wallet bc the private keys aren’t even stored on the device, there is no way to steal the coins. Essentially your coins are stored only in your brain.
@_date: 2019-06-07 17:38:34

@_date: 2018-06-14 22:08:31
Same answer: 
Think it over. 
As bitcoin rises in value and more people move out of fiat into bitcoin, what  do you think will happen to the buying power of fiat as less people use it?  For a currency to retain its value it needs to be used. Good luck on getting interest then.

People will use bitcoin as a store of value and for transactions not requiring privacy.  There are countless privacy coins out there that will be used for other things. They can coexist with bitcoin and nobody can track those. But they don’t have the trust that bitcoin has because of its decentralized nature among other properties.

Well, aren't we having a good day today! Nice way to start the weekend. Perhaps this pump has something to do with the news report (below) that illustrates a softening at the SEC to the possibility of approving the first ever Bitcoin ETF.  If this happens it would open the floodgates to casual investors to get a piece of the crypto pie, which will likely send bitcoin soaring. 
I feel very strongly that 2019 is the year to buy as much bitcoin as you possibly can.  That's my plan anyway.  With the block reward halvening set to occur in May 2020, that alone could spark the next bull run.  A bitcoin ETF combined with the halvening would quickly send us to the moon.
&amp;nbsp;  
Congratulations to all the hodlers for toughing it out this long.  I am with you.  We will get through this bear market together and hopefully, one day, celebrate together.  
All the best,

Big news today of Facebook launching their Libra currency in 2020.  It even [headlined on Drudge](  I'm not a fan of the Libra because it  is not truly decentralized like Bitcoin and I don't trust Facebook at all.  However, the attention it will bring to Bitcoin cannot be understated.  So, I think this is good news for Bitcoin.™

Yes it will fluctuate wildly short term and when it goes down we say “it’s time to buy the f***ing dip “ (btfd). This strategy has not failed me even in a bear market because I’m way up right now.

I have a feeling that in a few years we’re going to look pretty foolish lamenting and worrying about the current bitcoin prices.
Strolling back through memory lane (6 years ago), the doom and gloom back then about bitcoin being dead, “game over” and “this time is different” seem ridiculous today.  Have a look at a few choice posts:

@_date: 2019-06-23 06:08:05
@_date: 2019-12-26 18:52:48
Because with the bitfi you have to memorize a passphrase and salt (easy to remember) but would take millions of years with the worlds most powerful supercomputers to crack (if ever)
However the flaw in devices like the ledger (or Trezor) is that people tend to write down their private keys and hide them somewhere (in a safe, or buried, etc) which could be found and stolen.  
Nobody could ever steal your coins from a bitfi wallet if you use a strong passphrase, because you would not write it down anywhere. The keys would only be in your brain. This makes it safe from being stolen or confiscation.
These keys are not stored on the device either

Bitcoin will shake off this FUD like it always does and be back on its way up again soon.
@_date: 2019-12-27 16:46:13
All it will take is for bitcoin to 3x from here, surpassing the previous ATH to make mainstream news headlines again. 
When this happens, Bitcoin will be back in the public spotlight. It will be proven to be alive and well and back on its path to glory. 
The fomo will be unbelievable, because now a much larger segment of the population than ever before will see that bitcoin doesn’t die. They’ll think, “hmmm, maybe there’s something to this bitcoin thing after all. I should probably get some just in case.”
The halvening will continue to propel the price upwards into late 2020 and 2021. 
As the price crosses the $50k threshold, nobody will be able to ignore Bitcoin any longer, not even the institutional investors. The governments and banks will be very scared.

If I’m thinking of the same thing you are, I believe I said that in the summer.  It was predicated on the VanEck bitcoin etf that a lot of people thought would be approved in September.  The etf decision was postponed by the SEC until March 2019 at the latest. If approved, bitcoin will surely reach ATH again. 
P.S.  Bakkt was supposed to launch in November, but was also delayed until January.  This would have impacted price favorably in November as well.

@_date: 2018-11-19 22:16:14
Yeah I already explained that.  Many people at the time were expecting the VanEck etf to be approved by the sec in September. That would have started a new bull run for sure.  And we’d be well over 10k. That’s why price rose to $8.4k in August. The sec decision was delayed 
@_date: 2018-11-20 20:06:36
I’m not sure what planet you are living on but people are already using bitcoin in all of the ways I listed above. Some to a greater degree than others. 
Did you know that a lot of porn sites take crypto including bitcoin right now?
Lightning network will solve the scalability issues and transaction fees will be infinitesimal even with volume. 
Right now purchasing power is volatile but that will stabilize as bitcoin user base grows. 
And bitcoin is private enough for many transactions. I don’t necessarily care if someone sees my money movement history on the immutable ledger as long as they cannot identify who I am. 
@_date: 2018-11-19 20:25:22
Lol. Then why did I just buy $2k worth last Wednesday?    I have really been trying to keep this crash from happening all year (against my own interests) so that we can end the bear market sooner.  But I’m not going to pass up the opportunity of a lifetime and scoop up more after the crash finishes.

@_date: 2018-11-26 22:01:27
When someone puts their money in a bank or cd the value in their bank account rises because of interest.  Yet people still spend their cash. 
I suspect once bitcoin stabilizes in the far future, the effect will be similar. You will not get any interest, but your bitcoin purchasing power will very slowly increase. 
@_date: 2018-11-01 19:44:12
You are utterly clueless.  There is so much happening now on the institutional front with Bakkt, custodial solutions being built (fidelity), etfs being reviewed by the sec with a good chance of approval soon (VanEck cboe), Lightning network expanding, decentralized exchanges being developed and some might be launched in 2019.  The halvening is in 2020.  The lead up to and execution of any of these could spark the next bull run.  We probably have one more year (if we’re really lucky) to snag bitcoin at reasonable prices.

**Update on the VanEck Bitcoin ETF:**
Brought to you by [Hopium time]( ™
Hopefully they will be able to convince enough of the SEC deciding body to approve the ETF by March 2019. They are certainly trying.  
Needless to say if this gets approved we will likely see a huge price increase. 








@_date: 2018-11-12 16:21:24
If that were true then why wouldn’t the bag holders have cashed out when it hit $8300 in July. I think only the diehards are left at this point. 
@_date: 2018-11-28 14:45:25
Yes and the beautiful thing about bitcoin (unlike many other cryptocurrencies) is that it has a fixed maximum supply of 21 million coins.  So as more people continue to treat it as a store of value, the price will rise over time (demand &gt; supply).  Millions of bitcoins have been lost forever by irresponsible owners. So the max available supply is really a lot less than 21 million.   Thus, it is no wonder pundits like Tim Draper are making predictions that bitcoin is likely to be $250,000 per coin by 2022. 
@_date: 2018-11-26 21:42:57
I’d like it lower too so I can buy more cheaply, but I worry the lower it gets the longer the bear market will take to complete.  Maybe I’m wrong on that tho

I’m going by long term logarithmic trend as the basis for my $5800 equilibrium hypothesis.  If a giant whale decides to shake up the market price can crash below that for a short period, but it should tend towards its natural equilibrium after a while. I would not be surprised to see us back above $6k in December

Well said. I’m buying.  I think the natural equilibrium point is currently ~6k  (my thoughts since September) so I expect we’ll get back up there soon (December).  We crashed hard and the rubber band was stretched nearly to breaking point. It looks like we might be headed back up again. ��

I remember I tried to back up my theory that $5800 was the natural bottom a few months ago. I isolated the growth rate from 2014-2016 and extrapolated into 2018 by omitting the parabolic rise in 2017. Then I guesstimated the new hodlers created as of the last bull run who stayed engaged.  I think you are being too critical of my amateur efforts here. I don’t claim to be an expert.

I gave you an upvote for your high effort post above.
TBH I used an extremely simple linear regression model and didn't really factor in uncertainty precisely, because I was looking for a ballpark target. When I did this (a few months back) I literally just plugged in a bunch of bitcoin price points from 2014-2016 into my trusty old TI-86 and came up with the linear model of the form (y-y1)=m(x-x1). Yes I still use this type of calculator. I omitted year 2017 because it was an anomalous hype-driven bubble and didn't represent natural growth unlike the period 2014-2016. The model output a price of ~$4000 by the end of 2018. It basically approximates a doubling in price every year from 2014.  Then I speculated that we must have attained a good number of Hodlers due to the news hype media exposure during the 2017 bull run.  I am just one of those new Holders (continuously accumulating bitcoin).  So I cede your point that there is a lot of uncertainty in that part of my theory, but since we respected the $5.8k price all year until now I thought I wasn't too far off.  I fancy the bitcoin floor kind of like a trampoline. The equilibrium floor point for the last few months has been ~$5.8k -&gt; ~$6k. Since Wednesday we had a hard crash with an unknown cause, so the trampoline floor was pressed down below it's equilibrium range.  If my theory holds, we should see it rise back above equilibrium over the coming weeks.  I would be surprised if we didn't get back above $6k by end of December.

It seems bitcoin is no longer following the usual trends.  We should be way up by now at this point in the weekend.   The trend line before the google news would have had us at 11.5k by March 20th. That google ad ban  really hurt the market.  Now I feel it will take longer.  I am definitely hodling though. These whales will not get my hard earned bitcoin no matter what.   If I had any fiat left I’d be buying this like a mofo right now.   Bitcoin has its ups and downs and right now we are down, but we’ll be back up eventually. If this was a shitcoin I’d be worried right now.  But it’s bitcoin so we’ll be fine. Just have to have patience. Hang in there hodlers.

Well when enough people eventually adopt and hodl/use bitcoin then the price will stabilize since the potential for it to skyrocket diminishes. The winkelvos twins thought the price target would be around 300k. This would make it gold 2.0.  
I agree with that assessment. I think once it reaches that number the price will stabilize and people will be less inclined to hodl and will start actively using it more for purchases.

The only thing I lost out on was the opportunity to buy even more with less money.  This doesn’t matter because I have already accumulated enough to be financially independent when bitcoin moons in a few years. That is enough for me. 
And the lower it goes in this short term bear market, the better off I’ll be as I buy more cheaply. 
@_date: 2018-11-26 19:02:49
I have always said I invest long term (&gt;3 years) only. I don’t give financial advice. I stand by my long-standing prediction that bitcoin will be $100k by May 1, 2021.  You are free to disagree, but I’m no troll. I have a lot of money in bitcoin because I believe in it.  Short term price fluctuations only matter if you are a day trader. If so, you bore me. 
Also cryptogrip does not give financial advice either. He gives interesting info about bitcoin and positivity. He’s ok in my book.

Rumors are that the whales involved with the bch fork needed to sell tens of thousands of bitcoins to fund their hash war. Whether this actually happened or just traders reacting to the possibility of it happening is unclear.  My understanding is that this initially caused us to lose the $6k support.  Once we lost the support stop losses were triggered tumbling price further.  That’s when we entered capitulation territory. Disappointingly, even some of the hodlers seem to have folded. 
I don’t make decisions about an asset in a atmosphere of abject fear.  I made a decision a long time ago that I like the technology and want to support it. I think it will catch on over the course of years, not months.   Bitcoin has endured severe bear markets before and always comes back stronger.  This time will be no different.  
@_date: 2018-11-22 21:21:51
Umm actually i have family that live overseas and wiring money to them is not uncommon. There are a lot of people that could benefit from fast  speed of send and tiny transaction fees of bitcoin.  E.g. Millions of Latino workers send money back to there families in their home countries. So yeah bye bye western union. Hello bitcoin. 
Privacy: a motivated person could find out what companies i transacted with if they can trace the wallet address but they won’t know it’s me unless I transact in person. If I desire even greater privacy I could convert to a privacy coin that starts with an M.  But for most purchases this level of anonymity is sufficient. 
By the tone of your response you are obviously very hostile to bitcoin. It makes me question why you are even here arguing with me about something you don’t seem to understand or believe in. Suspicious. 
@_date: 2018-11-20 14:51:21
Absolutely true.  I can afford the risk for a once in a lifetime chance to invest in something I truly believe in that I think will make me wealthy over the long run.  In just a few years I think it will be $100k+ so I will more than 10x on my initial investment.  As it goes lower I can buy even more super cheap so I would get an even better return. 
@_date: 2018-11-15 16:31:35
IMO in the case of bitcoin, an asset with a limited supply, its track record of ever increasing price over time is a representation of the growing  number of active buyers sustaining the price rise.  The hodlers continuously buying more and more as time goes on.  This is why it has always respected long term trend. 
Edit:  in other words since the market is still in its early days, it is highly susceptible to the wills of mega whales with agendas. The natural growth of the market cannot sustain that kind of assault in the short term.  Or it will at least have difficulty maintaining its equilibrium point. That’s probably what we are witnessing right now. 
@_date: 2018-11-27 19:19:05

�� Hopium Time �� �� - S02E24
2018 thinking of an Untrue Hodler:
When you bought bitcoin at $11,000 and believed you were smart for buying the dip.  “BUY THE DIP MOFOS! HODL”
Then you bought at $9,897 and couldn’t believe your luck that you could still get some below $10k. “Woohoo! Under $10k baby!”
Price drops to $8k and you start feverishly buying thinking you may never get a better chance again. “This thing is gonna fly soon again!!!”
Price drops to $7k.  “Uh oh. What’s going on? Why isn’t it going up yet?  Maybe I should just wait to buy more later.   Hmm or should I sell?”
Price drops to $6k. “OH SHIT!!! THE SKY IS FALLING!  WE ARE ALL DOOMED! TIME TO SELL!!!”
June 29, 2018 bitcoin falls to $5,835.75.  “So glad I sold, now I can just sit back and watch in safety” 
Meanwhile the smart money loads up.  
July 25, 2018 bitcoin reaches $8,416.87.  “Bull run finally starting baby. Time to buy MOAR!!!”
I think the lesson here is that short term price fluctuations are meaningless. The best time to buy is when most others have lost all hope.  Smart people bought more when the price was just $5.8k, while the Untrue Hodler already sold. 
Bitcoin has nearly a 10 year track record of increasing over the long term. There are many positive developments happening with bitcoin in the next few months into 2019 and the Halvening isn’t that far away either (2020).  If you buy and HODL for years, you will be glad you did.

Am I correct that this was much cheaper and easier to do when bitcoin price was very low (years ago) and wouldn’t really be an issue in the future since the cost of a bitcoin will be much higher and no one in their right mind would pay that kind of money to store an illicit image in a blockchain?  Or does this have nothing to do with the price.

What should be done with any stowaway trolls �� when we get to the moon ��?
We have to consider logistics. 
@_date: 2018-11-20 19:13:01
I can see it gaining traction initially as a supplemental currency rather than a complete replacement to fiat. 
Here are just a few reasons everyday people might like to convert from fiat to bitcoin:
- transactions to replace wire transfers. Tiny fees compared to using banks. Especially international wires. 
- when traveling to other countries that accept bitcoin it makes it easy to pay anyone anywhere in the world in one kind of currency instead of having to convert to local currency. 
- online transactions. So that credit card companies don’t have a detailed record of every purchase you make and cannot resell your data to advertisers. This is a privacy issue. 
- adult entertainment.  I prefer anonymity when purchasing my adult entertainment. Bitcoin can do that in the sense that nobody will know who I am. They will only know my wallet address. The adult industry alone is extremely huge so this is a real use case. 
- gambling industry including sports (privacy and security)
- paying international gig workers (simplifies currency conversion issues)
Later on, once bitcoin reaches a sustainable price stability, merchants will begin to realize they could save on transaction fees by accepting bitcoin.  Credit card payments will begin to fall out of favor as merchants begin to offer incentives (discounts?) to customers. They will do this because it will be more efficient to accept bitcoin than cash due to the issues involved with handling cash (administrative accounting, physical handling and its easy to steal cash). 
This is just a small glimpse of bitcoin’s potential from my POV. I’m sure others could add to this list.

Based on long term logarithmic growth trend the mean price is around $4000 right now. Technically it should be higher due to new holders in 2017 and 2018 but apparently a lot of them turned out to be pussies.   I’d say odds are at least 75% we’ll see at least one more moon.   We have fidelity institutional custody solutions, Bakkt, and a possible VanEck etf coming in 2019. The halvening is in 2020.  After that my hope is bitcoin will succeed but I can’t predict that far out.

Yeah over the summer (not spring) I thought it would be above 12k because I was expecting the VanEck solidx etf to be approved by the SEC in September which definitely would have started a bull run. This as you know has been delayed. Probably won’t happen until March now (if ever).  Events change things.  A lot of people thought that etf would be approved. That’s why price hit $8400

The funny thing is if everyone thinks it’s gonna go lower and stops buying, guess what? It’s likely to go lower. If everyone decides now is the time buy, buy, buy. Guess what? It tends to go up.  
If we want to eventually get away from fiat currency which puts us at the whims of government and banksters... if we want bitcoin to succeed and attract new people to give it a try allowing it to grow, at some point we need to be like, fuck it, I’m buying regardless. 
I realized this months ago and have been accumulating ever since.  Bought $2k worth on Wednesday (plus $1k of a utility token I like). I will buy more bitcoin at the end of month. I don’t have much fiat to spare right now, but my money is where my mouth is. Let’s do this bulls!

I never said anything was bullet proof. Maybe you are confusing me with someone else.  I speculated that $5,800 was the natural floor as we respected that price all year. I left open the possibility that we could drop below that, even welcomed it so I could buy more cheap, over a short term period.  Unusual whale activity like we witnessed this past week can impact the natural floor.  If my theory is correct we should see it rise back above $6k in December.  If not, I’ll count it as a miss. Until then stop misrepresenting my POV.

@_date: 2018-11-27 17:18:49
In a nutshell (imo) this is how I envision bitcoin’s potential:
1) short term potential (2-5 years hence) as it has been over the past 9 years, it will continue to be a  highly lucrative speculative asset over the next few years (once bear market ends). May have a couple of more dramatic bull/bear runs. I predict $100k bitcoin by May 1, 2021 or sooner. 
2) mid term potential (6-10 years hence) begins to be used by early adopters as a currency as adoption increases. Price continues to rise significantly, but more slowly. Still a good investment opportunity. Might hit mcafee’s one million prediction in this time range if bitcoin continues to prosper. 
3) long term potential (11+ years hence) - mass adoption as a currency and store of value (like gold). Volatility at this point would be negligible as it continues to very slowly rise due to deflation. Governments will also begin using it to make huge cross border transactions. 
The only forecast I am very confident in is  I hope  and  happen. Time will tell. 
@_date: 2018-03-27 02:37:13
Because there are a small handful of whales buying or selling large amounts of bitcoin all at once. They do this to move the market one direction or another with the purpose of inducing fomo or panic selling. Then they cash in on stupid/ignorant investors.   So the little guy gets hosed again and again.

I have ~2.5 years to go. The bet is the bet. If price reaches $100k I already committed to buy a track chair for the Vets. They currently cost like $15k I think.   I potentially could lose $99,999 if I lose the bet.  Certainly if bitcoin crashes to almost nothing I will be too broke to donate anything beyond that one bitcoin.

It’s your personal decision. I don’t want to see anyone get in trouble if my beliefs are wrong.  Nobody should be risking money that they can’t afford to lose anyway. I can afford to take this risk for something I believe in.  All I can say is I firmly believe in bitcoin’s long term future and I never panic sell.  I’ve been buying and hodling all year and that won’t change.

Mass adoption will not occur until we have more sustainable price stability. Price stability will not happen until a lot more people buy, hold and use.   Enough users so that whales cannot so easily move the price much.  It will take at least 5 years before it sees regular use by normies as a currency. For now it’s just a speculative asset.

I’m open to suggestions on when is the best time to buy more. I keep getting the timing wrong.  Bought at 11.6 as it was charging up only to have it fall almost immediately after.  Bought more at 9.9k as it was creeping past 10k.   Then it fell again.   Now it is 9.3k and I’m tempted to buy more. Should I wait?

Why would you not want to be your own bank when you don’t need these institutions involved? Be free... bitcoin can do this for you.  It’s  about privacy, freedom and convenience.  As the wallets apps improve its going to be faster than whipping out your cash.    You should really check out bitcoin.org and learn more about this important tech.

Reposting here for greater exposure:
I can see bitcoin gaining traction initially as a supplemental currency rather than a complete replacement to fiat. 
Here are just a few reasons everyday people might like to convert from fiat to bitcoin:
- transactions to replace wire transfers. Tiny fees compared to using banks. Especially international wires. 
- when traveling to other countries that accept bitcoin it makes it easy to pay anyone anywhere in the world in one kind of currency instead of having to convert to local currency. 
- online transactions. So that credit card companies don’t have a detailed record of every purchase you make and cannot resell your data to advertisers. This is a privacy issue. 
- adult entertainment.  I prefer anonymity when purchasing my adult entertainment. Bitcoin can do that in the sense that nobody will know who I am. They will only know my wallet address. The adult industry alone is extremely huge so this is a real use case. 
- gambling industry including sports (privacy and security)
- paying international gig workers (simplifies currency conversion issues)
Later on, once bitcoin reaches a sustainable price stability, merchants will begin to realize they could save on transaction fees by accepting bitcoin.  Credit card payments will begin to fall out of favor as merchants begin to offer incentives (discounts?) to customers who pay with bitcoin. They will do this because it will be more efficient to accept bitcoin than cash due to the issues involved with handling cash (administrative accounting, physical handling and its easy to steal cash). 
This is just a small glimpse of bitcoin’s potential from my POV. I’m sure others could add to this list.

I am glad I started buying in January, without gain... yet.  It was one of the wisest things I did in life (because bitcoin will be much higher in a few years). I have also become a tougher and less fearful person, because I have survived these steep dips.  I spend time having fun on bitcoin related social media and discussion forums spreading my knowledge &amp; excitement about this amazing technology. It distracts me from my otherwise mundane life and I am much less stressed. Sometimes I take breaks to read, and wonder how I could ever go back to my prior nocoiner condition.  Shame on the panic sellers who never really believed in the coin, since I believe this is like horses betting for most of them.

I have mixed feelings about it.  However if we ever want to see a bitcoin ETF and someday bitcoin in retirement plans (401k), then the winklevoss twins seem to have the right strategy. These types of investment vehicles require strict rules be followed.  Bitcoin in 401k plans would be a huge boon to the price.

It’s kind of a big deal. Will likely launch during the first quarter of 2019. They will be buying and holding physical bitcoin as backup. 
They are partnered with Starbucks and Microsoft.  One goal is to allow you to more easily purchase a coffee at Starbucks by converting your bitcoin to fiat on the spot to complete the transaction. 
I envision a “Bitcoin accepted here, powered by Bakkt” sticker on the window at Starbucks which would obviously get more people interested in buying bitcoin. 
They have recently secured $182 million in first round funding.

So a lot of people will probably be reporting capital losses from crypto on their tax returns during the next few months.  Many of those will likely receive nice tax refunds as a result. 
I wonder if they will put a nice size chunk of that refund back into crypto at these fire sale prices.  This is what I’m planning to do (from my trading stack). If so, this could help stabilize the market for a while until Fidelity custody solutions and Bakkt kick into gear in a few months.

That was an interesting read. I would agree there is price suppression.   Could be cartel, govts, banks, whales. Who knows?  There are many groups who have a lot to lose if bitcoin succeeds.  
The answer is we fish (and benevolent whales ��) need to unite and buy and hodl. There are only 21 million coins. The more fish that hodl the more power we have.  The bad guys will lose eventually.   Bitcoin is unstoppable in the long run.  The sooner we get on board the faster this will happen.  Panic selling is the worst thing we fish could do.

@_date: 2019-01-10 23:45:10
Your reasoning neglects the fact that bitcoin has a fixed 21 million coin maximum supply with an ever growing number of lost coins. It has unusual deflationary properties unlike the Franc. These properties make it a potentially amazingly profitable long term investment.  However later in its maturity these gains will get smaller as more users buy, hold and spend it.  At a certain point people aren’t going to bother hodling it as much as the gains will not be as exciting. They will invest long term elsewhere. At that point the masses would be using it as an everyday currency. Your logic is flawed. 
@_date: 2018-03-18 05:37:47
Exactly it puts the power back in the hands of the people. All of us should be getting behind this. Selling our bitcoin is like stabbing each other in the back. We are only hurting ourselves by helping to delay the adoption of the tech.  The greater the price volatility due to panic selling the longer it will take for the common man to accept the change.

Our word is our bond.  This technology is worth fighting for.  Letting the price slip to the abyss will not help bitcoin. It will delay its adoption due to the extreme volatility.

Some of you may feel uncomfortable with the Winklevoss twins’ (Gemini) rules based crypto strategy, but I appreciate their efforts to make bitcoin the future of money.
I also have mixed feelings about it.  However if we ever want to see a bitcoin ETF and someday bitcoin in retirement plans (401k), then the winklevoss twins seem to have the right strategy. These types of investment vehicles require strict rules be followed.  Bitcoin in 401k plans would be a huge boon to the price.

Ahahahahaha!   I’ll grant that once in a while you make some interesting points, but most of your posts are overwhelmingly negative.  And you post a lot of them.   I think there are enough trolls here with that job already.  If you hate bitcoin so much why do you spend so much of your life trashing it here?  Seems like a waste of time to me.    
On the other hand I openly admit that I’m a huge bitcoin fan. I’m here because it’s usually fun and sometimes even exciting.  Most of my posts are geared to cheering bitcoin on, because I want to see the price rise.   If I see anything of serious concern about bitcoin (such as the illicit material found within the blockchain) I point it out and ask questions.   All the negativity (using hyperbolic words like “collapse ”) can scare away new investors.       
In sum, it’s fine to point out the pros and cons about bitcoin, but when all you post are cons you start to look like a troll.  Might want to rethink that strategy if you want people to give serious consideration to your point of view. 
@_date: 2019-01-15 23:29:10
I’m unfazed by a little delay.  I see enough positive momentum to keep me excited:
@_date: 2019-01-10 22:56:26
Actually I do spend my bitcoin to buy stuff. 
But IMO we will be in a speculative phase for at least a couple of more bull/bear cycles. We just don’t have enough users yet to stabilize bitcoin enough to reliably use as a currency. 
An etf would enable more casual users who don’t want to deal with wallets to invest. 
It would also pave the way for even more traditional investment opportunities. Maybe even entry into 401k plans someday.  If that happens the price would skyrocket to unimaginable levels.

Got this in my e-mail today.  Just a peek into what the Gemini exchange (Cameron + Tyler Winklevoss) is doing to build the future of money.
Today, we ran a full-page ad in the New York Times outlining what we think the cryptocurrency revolution needs to succeed. We firmly believe this revolution will re-architect trade, the financial system, the Internet, and money as we know it.
But it won’t be easy, and there is no guarantee. 
The crypto revolution has the potential to solve meaningful, real-world problems that no other technology can – but only a thoughtful, rule-based approach will get us there. Revolutions that build sets of rules to ensure a better future, are the ones that last.
As a result, we are sharing the following set of guiding principles that we believe will help crypto fulfill its ultimate promise. As we build a real, sustainable bridge between the ‘old world’ of money and the future of money, we strive to always:
1. Build the Rules.
To work with regulators to establish thoughtful regulation that promotes positive and fair outcomes for all.
In 2014, we testified at the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) Virtual Currency Hearings. These hearings set the stage for a thoughtful dialogue between the NYDFS and the crypto community, eventually leading to the New York Virtual Currency Regulations. To date, NYDFS has licensed or chartered 12 virtual currency businesses. All of these businesses, including Gemini which is a New York trust company, operate within a regulatory framework that fosters consumer protection. 
In addition, we have championed best practices that we believe make Gemini a safe place that fosters market integrity:
- Marketplace Conduct Rules - On September 21, 2017, we adopted Marketplace Conduct Rules. These rules were modeled off of the Cboe Futures Exchange, LLC (CFE) Rulebook.
- Marketplace Surveillance - On April 25, 2018, we announced our partnership with Nasdaq to implement Nasdaq’s SMARTS Market Surveillance technology to monitor the Gemini marketplace. As of August 10, 2018, SMARTS has been deployed on the Gemini marketplace.
- Market Surveillance Team - On April 25, 2018, we hired a Head of Market Surveillance. Since then, we have built a Market Surveillance Team that continues to grow. 
- Virtual Commodities Association - On March 13, 2018, we published a proposal for the Virtual Commodity Association, an industry-sponsored self-regulatory organization for virtual commodity exchanges. CFTC Commissioner Brian Quintenz issued a public statement in support. The initial working group held its inaugural meeting in September 2018.
This is just the beginning as we plan to continue to engage and work with regulators across the country on both the state and federal level (Gemini currently has licenses or approvals in 49 states), as well as internationally, to help shape thoughtful regulation and oversight so that consumers are afforded the same protections in the crypto market as they are in more traditional markets.
2. Play by the Rules.
To operate with necessary governmental or regulatory approvals. Ask for permission, not for forgiveness.
Although we started building Gemini in 2014, we waited until we received our New York trust company license in October of 2015 to begin operating. Our decision  —  to ask for permission, not forgiveness  —  was a first in cryptocurrency. We chose this path because we believed that in order to build the future of money, we had to first build trust in this new asset class.
We are compliance-centric company — we have developed (and will continue to invest in) cutting edge tools for our Compliance Department to ensure that Gemini is not a place for bad actors. 
3. Value Security Over Profit.
To never cut corners. To set the standard and follow best practices in order to provide a platform that is free of hacking and fraud.
Financial crime affects both fiat and cryptocurrencies alike, but the crypto revolution will not succeed if our industry is plagued by nefarious activity. High-profile hacks that result in catastrophic losses must become a thing of the past, and we must shake the image of an industry characterized by poor security standards, internal controls, and policies and procedures. 
In an effort to do so, we built our team with a security-first mentality from day one — a team that has built a state-of-the-art hot wallet and cold storage system and is deeply committed to employing cybersecurity best practices to protect your funds and the integrity of our platform. Recently, we added a further layer of protection by securing insurance coverage for the cryptocurrency that we hold on your behalf in our online hot wallet. We are, and will continue to be, committed to making Gemini a safe and secure platform to store your cryptocurrency. 
4. Be Principled.
To do the right thing – because it’s the right thing – even when it’s the hard thing. To put the interests of our customers ahead of our own and provide proper disclosures and transparency.
The four pillars of Gemini are Product, Security, Licensing, and Compliance. We refuse to compromise in any of these areas and will continue to invest in long-term solutions that align with our North Star of building a company that provides enduring value to our customers — for more than a 100 years — a Centurion. We will continue to do these things even when it’s the harder, less profitable, and slower path in the short-term. We’re in this for the long game; we’re trying to be the fastest tortoise in the race.
5. Pay it Forward.
To bring cryptocurrency to the people and places that need it most.
Like the invention of money itself, which solved the coincidence of wants dilemma and removed the shackles of barter; like the evolution of credit and debt, which helped transfer capital from idle savers to risk-taking entrepreneurs; like the invention of the joint-stock company, which spurred on investment by enabling atomistic ownership structures and limiting an investor's liability to his or her stock ownership; and like the invention of the stock exchange, which allowed liquid markets for a company’s shares to emerge, the invention of cryptocurrencies have irrevocably expanded our concept of money and will forever change how we exchange, transfer, and store it. 
Not since the dawn of the Internet has technology had the potential for such profound impact. But in order to make such an impact, we must bring this technology to all reaches of the globe. We have started by building the Gemini dollar, which brings U.S. dollars onto the blockchain and to anyone in the world with an Internet connection. This is the first of many projects we hope to embark on that help foster, among other things, financial inclusion (e.g., banking the 1 billion+ unbanked citizens of the world), reduced friction and costs of cross-border payments (e.g., remittances), access to digital safe-haven assets (e.g., buying bitcoin through the Gemini Mobile App), and a more decentralized Internet that returns control of your data back to you. 
Join the Gemini Mission
We are only at the beginning of this journey. Yes, some of the hardest work remains ahead, but we’re up for the challenge and we know you are too. We welcome industry leaders, developers, builders, entrepreneurs, investors, and whoever else, to join us as we strive to build rules for this amazing revolution that will ensure not just the future of money, but a better future for all.
Onward and Upward,
Cameron + Tyler

I’ve been relying on a different logarithmic chart for a while. It’s from August 2018 so it’s dated, but I still think it’s going to turn out to be right:
I think we also need to factor in institutional interest like Bakkt and a possible VanEck etf coming soon. This could be a game changer unlike previous bull/bear cycles.

I use it as a payment method and then afterwards I immediately rebuy it with fresh fiat. This will be necessary (to avoid missing gains) until we achieve a much higher bitcoin price and larger user base.

This message is mainly for the newbs here, but if you are feeling queasy right now about your investment in Bitcoin maybe this will help you too:
Bitcoin (and Blockchain) is a truly beautiful innovation that is here to stay.  If you feel nervous about the price volatility at this early stage of development, I encourage you to read some of the first e-mails by the creator of Bitcoin Satoshi Nakamoto and the reaction from his e-mail group:
Here is the original white-paper:
At times I get nervous too when I look at the price, as I have a lot invested in bitcoin.  At these times it is very reassuring to read these early writings on bitcoin and it reminds me why I'm invested.  
Another thing that helps is to watch some youtube videos by the Winklevoss twins. They have been true believers in bitcoin almost since the beginning and believe the price could eventually get to over 300,000 per coin (marketshare of gold).  There are others like John Mcafee that believe it could easily get to 1 million per coin by end of 2020.   Even if it only gets to 100k by then that's still 10x your money today!  And by holding bitcoin longterm you are helping this amazing system (based on pure math) succeed.  It could really change the world and you could be a part of it.  Think of this before you panic sell in the future.  
To repeat my earlier advice, follow my lead and get some money ready on the side to buy any significant drops caused by the Mt Gox guy dumping.  You will thank me later if you buy when you can and hold long term.  All the best to my fellow hodlers.  
@_date: 2018-11-19 21:39:11
Is that where you think bitcoin will be in 2021?  
@_date: 2018-11-28 19:40:57
I think it was close to the bottom around $6k until faketoshi and associated bch fork whales allegedly started selling tens of thousands of bitcoin on the OPEN MARKET to fund their hash wars, sending the market into a tailspin.  
@_date: 2018-03-11 02:53:39
If you look at the one day chart it looks like it’s starting to curve upwards again. If the trend over the last few weeks is any representation of the future we should be firmly back in 11.5k territory by March 20th.  But it’s btc so who knows. 
@_date: 2018-03-09 19:10:32
Becoming as widely held as gold (and possibly more used as payment since it’s way easier to carry around with you to spend than gold).  The tech is really useful if (BIG IF) it becomes adopted by the mainstream.  I think discounting that possibility is a real missed opportunity.

Alright a few of you guys have convinced me to try trading bitcoin.  I am mainly a dip buyer and hodler but I need to add to my stack somehow and waiting for my paychecks is taking too long.  I’m only going to trade a very small portion of my total stack.   I’m hoping this won’t be a total disaster but since I’m only risking a little bit I’m not too worried.  Now watching the price 24/7 has a purpose other than just ocd. ��

I’m tempted to buy more but as soon as I do it usually plummets.  I’ve been holding out for a while but no dip. Strange. I think it’s waiting for me to hit buy. So If I don’t maybe it will just keep going up.

Bad news is I’m a little mad right now because I thought I would have some leftover cash last month to buy MOAR but I miscalculated. Fuck.  Anyway I should definitely have a few extra bucks by end of November to continue my accumulation strategy.  I’m feeling super lucky to have this much time.

I agree with that but American workers and corporations are receiving tax relief this year via reduced payroll withholdings and corporate tax. This is good for the economy (at least short term) because it gives more purchasing power to consumers, and corporations have extra money to invest in their businesses (more jobs).  
The deficit must be addressed as well. So I favor a cut in spending to coincide with the tax breaks 
@_date: 2018-11-19 20:12:49
No. I advocate long term investment only. That is clear as day from my post history.

@_date: 2018-11-26 15:37:45
I’ve always been suspicious of the trolls. I assume most are either shorters hoping to bring the price lower for profit, or people with an agenda that is against bitcoin and they are actively trying to contribute to its failure.  
The other explanation is that they are just opportunistic trolls trying to make people feel badly about their investment decisions.  Those kinds of trolls are sad losers probably still living in moms basement.

It became less painful to watch my stack get pummeled until I realized I haven’t really  lost anything. I believe in 2-3 years my stack will be worth at least 15 times its current price. $100k per bitcoin by May 1, 2021 is my prediction. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 05:25:22
Of course I want a profit. But I also truly believe in this tech.  Don't give me your bullshit that I can't have both.  My game-plan if this really takes off again is to sell some crypto in the short term so I can pay down some debt and live more comfortably. I also intend on keeping a significant amount in crypto long term.  I think we are still a few years off before this becomes more mainstream and adopted.  So many people don't understand blockchain so we are just at the beginning.

They should just pump it to 9k already!  Then you’ll see real fomo kick in,  positive news coverage, new buyers and we’d be back to 11k in no time.  The main reason we plummeted from those heights a few weeks ago was fear of the mt gox seller. Now that is a non issue until September and may never significantly impact the market anyway if they go off market solution. 
@_date: 2019-01-11 20:37:08
It’s not a pyramid scheme at all. I think the best strategy is educate yourself and them about what bitcoin really is and how blockchain was invented in the process of creating bitcoin.

**I firmly stand by my bitcoin bet.** I have always said bitcoin is a long term investor’s game.  On May 1, 2021 if bitcoin hasn’t yet reached $100k per coin, I will accept my lumps and your ridicule.

Rumors are that the whales involved with the bch fork needed to sell tens of thousands of bitcoins to fund their hash war. Whether this actually happened or just traders reacting to the possibility of it happening is unclear.  My understanding is that this initially caused us to lose the $6k support.  Once we lost the support stop losses were triggered tumbling price further.  That’s when we entered capitulation territory. Disappointingly, even some of the hodlers seem to have folded. 
I don’t make decisions about an asset in a atmosphere of abject fear.  I made a decision a long time ago that I like the technology and want to support it. I think it will catch on over the course of years, not months.   Bitcoin has endured severe bear markets before and always comes back stronger.  This time will be no different.

“I am a long term investor. I like bitcoin. I believe in what it stands for and what it will eventually become: a peer to peer permission-less payment system and deflationary store of value, that will free us like never before from government and bank control.  I will accumulate now when it is cheap and will hold through the inevitable peaks and valleys to come. I know one day my investment will be worth a fortune.”

I don’t think we are dealing with exponential growth. I think it’s logarithmic growth. Logarithmic growth rises very rapidly in the beginning and then tapers off later on.  Exponential growth would start out slow and then rise rapidly to infinity.  At some distant point in the future (when mass adoption occurs) the price will begin to experience very slow growth as we reach a population saturation point.  So that’s why I think this is the early stages of a logarithmic growth curve.

@_date: 2018-11-18 04:32:11
It’s not the same thing. At least be fair to me. I’m a math nerd (perhaps not a very good one) and used an extremely simple linear growth model to target the price.

@_date: 2018-03-08 01:22:40
Wel, well, well...So now we know what was really driving down the market, not just weak hands. This knowledge makes me more bullish on bitcoin since we have persevered through some dark dips.

When it hits $20k again most people will agree bitcoin is real 
@_date: 2018-03-14 23:32:23
Maybe I misunderstood the hodl term then.  To me it means buy and hold long term.  Then I continue to look for deals along the way and dollar cost average my buys.  I don’t just buy one lump sum and sit on my ass waiting for it to go up.  I continue to buy and increase my stack.  The only difference is I take less risk by not selling.  Sure I may not make the quick buck like day traders but since I believe in bitcoin I strongly feel in the long run I’ll be ok.   This is the same strategy many 401k advisers give to their participants.  It is extremely risky to time the market. That’s ok for some people but not all. It all depends on your individual risk tolerance.   On the flip side, if you are really unsure about the future success of bitcoin then you have no business hodling in this market. You either day trade or get out.

Well not to sound like a broken record but I’ve been buying several dips since 11k. Never sold. I think the tech behind bitcoin is amazing and has a future. I’m placing my bet mainly on bitcoin but I’m also invested in a few other cryptocurrencies as well.  I’m a long term hodler. 
@_date: 2018-11-19 20:07:10
You do realize just about everyone and their grandma was saying they thought the bottom was in back then?   Nobody can predict that mega whales involved with a bitcoin cash hardfork would suddenly sell tens of thousands of bitcoin crashing the market and destroying sentiment.  I always left open the possibility that something like this could happen. That’s why I told everyone to keep an emergency fund on hand just in case.

I have lost nothing because I have no need to sell for years.   I have a ton of money invested in bitcoin. 
What empty promises?  My prediction is that bitcoin will be $100k no later than May 1, 2021. That’s been my core belief almost all year.  Last time I checked we are still in 2018.  I have ~30 months to go. Judge my “empty promise” then.  Even if we don’t hit my target I would be shocked if we aren’t well past ATH by then. 
@_date: 2018-11-27 15:49:45
Bakkt will be buying a lot of actual bitcoin. This alone should drive up prices.

Blockchain was invented by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008 to serve as the public transaction ledger of the cryptocurrency bitcoin.[1] The invention of the blockchain for bitcoin made it the first digital currency to solve the double-spending problem without the need of a trusted authority or central server. The bitcoin design has inspired other applications,[1][3] and blockchains which are readable by the public are widely used by cryptocurrencies. Blockchain is considered a type of payment rail.[9] Private blockchains have been proposed for business use. Sources such as the Computerworld called the marketing of such blockchains without a proper security model "snake oil".[10]

I’m not so sure. But I think by the end of 2019 at the latest the bear should have gone deep into hibernation. 
@_date: 2018-11-14 22:03:01
So you believed in bitcoin when it was $1000s higher than now and you bought more.  Why not buy more now when it’s $1000s lower? Try to remember how you felt when you bought higher. Do you believe in bitcoin or not? Don’t succumb to your emotions. Think logically. 
If you are a long term investor then nothing has changed except the price. The fundamentals are actually improving over time. 
My Hopium Time that was posted earlier today right before we lost $6k was weirdly prescient:

I think we were lucky to get into the 3k’s.  Anything is possible but don’t count on a drop to $1k.  The mathematical mean is near $4k extrapolated based on growth from 2014-2016 before the parabolic rise in 2017.  And that’s completely ignoring all new holders since 2017.  That’s why I thought we’d hover around $6k for a while, until the faketoshi massacre occurred.

Hardware wallets are a simple solution to the safe storage problem.  And what??? Bitcoin is not a replacement for credit cards and loans. It is  a replacement of paper/coin currency.  It’s better than paper currency because it’s not susceptible to inflation. It’s basically portable, divisible gold.

So when the next mt gox dump inevitably comes and the market dives you are ready and able to take full advantage and buy the dip.  Don’t be caught off guard and you will feel so good that you can profit from it without having to sell any coins.  And remember The blood on the streets will be washed away ... the dip will pass.

When bitcoin starts its uphill climb again, does anyone have a realistic guess as to how high it could go let’s say in 3 years time?  I saw one article claiming it could hit 100k in one year.  Are there certain factors that would make it impossible to go beyond a certain price (like how there are upper limits on cpu processing power)? 
@_date: 2018-11-23 18:21:59
Bitcoin cyclically dips. Some dips are more severe than others. But it always comes back stronger.  The difference is many of the  crash trolls think it’s never coming back which makes them the idiots.  Most hodlers with a long term perspective realize it could take until 2020 to come back to ath.

@_date: 2018-02-26 20:31:10
Looking through my crystal ball, Maybe down the road people will treat bitcoin as their savings account since it’s a store of value with a capped supply. And the transaction speed isn’t currently as fast as some other coins.  Then maybe they’ll use an altcoin like a checking account for everyday purchases since it would be faster and cheaper.  The question is which altcoin will emerge to be your checking account of the future?
@_date: 2018-02-05 01:46:12
I would definitely buy more now but coinbase has my buying right restricted and their support sucks.  I've been locked out for like 5 days with no help.
@_date: 2018-11-28 03:43:29

@_date: 2018-02-05 02:18:20
I think we bulls are still bullish because we understand that the underlying technology behind bitcoin is worth taking the risk.  There will be a significant role for crypto in the future.  This is a longterm hold for me for sure.  Anybody looking to try to time the market on this is reckless.

@_date: 2018-07-12 18:14:27
Cool.  So you are still bullish with a long term time horizon.    My belief is that we will be at 100k by early 2021 due to the halvening and finally some institutional investment by then.

**WELCOME TO THE OFFICIAL - BITCOIN BET FOR THE VETS PLEDGE PAGE**
Please reply directly to this post or on my [twitter page]( with your **irrevocable honor-bound pledge** and tell us what percentage of my donation you will agree to make. Thank you.
�� Hopium Time �� �� - S02E03
**The Bet.**
So, I have decided to make a bet.  Some of you may recall a few months ago I made a prediction that Bitcoin would be $100,000 USD within 3 years.  I'm not sure exactly the first time I said it, but I think it was somewhere between May-June.  So let's just say by May 1st.  Here's one such instance:
My bet is that by May 1, 2021 the price of Bitcoin will be at least $100,000 USD.  If it does not reach my target, then I will **donate ONE bitcoin** to my favorite charity, The Independence Fund.  [


The high tech wheelchairs that they provide the Vets are amazing and really life changing.
Even if Bitcoin reaches my $100,000 USD target, I will still make a donation amount of my own choice, but it will at least be enough to buy ONE wheelchair (\~$15,000 USD each, I believe).
Just to be clear on my bet above. The price must reach $100,000 USD sometime between now and May 1, 2021 for me to win the bet. If it reaches only $99,999 I will lose the bet. If it reaches $100,000 before May 1, 2021 and dips below $100,000 on May 1, 2021, then I still win the bet.
Would anyone like to pledge to match my donation (see below)?  If so please reply to this thread.
I hope my confidence in Bitcoin's long term price potential gives you some hope, especially in this frustrating bear market.
**7/21/18 Revision to bet matching:**
I will allow someone who pledges to match my bet to decide what percentage of my donation they will match (minimum 5%).  Please reply directly to this thread to make your honor bound irrevocable commitment to donate with me on May 1, 2021.  **You would make your donation directly to the charity on that date.**  I will include you on my public list of donors.  Also, while I have pledged to donate enough to buy one track chair for the Vets even if I win the bet, you as a bet matcher, will be encouraged to do the same, but it is not required.
If you have any questions, or need clarification please fee free to ask.  Thanks for your time in reading this.  I hope you will participate for this great charity, The Independence Fund!
&amp;nbsp; 
May 1st is [Silver Star Service Banner Day]( a time to recognize those who have been awarded The Silver Star Medal, and remember the sacrifices of our wounded and ill veterans.  
It is also [Loyalty day]( - a day set aside "for the reaffirmation of loyalty to the United States and for the recognition of the heritage of American freedom."
So it seems like a fitting day to make the donation.

I’m not a merchant, but as a consumer the easiest wallet I know is the Coinbase wallet. 
I have also used the bitpay wallet and have seen merchants using that one.  But I think their service converts the bitcoin to fiat.  Hopefully someone more versed in this can answer you.

You must be kidding.  The only way to pay down that debt is through tax revenue.  Govt must confiscate more money from it’s citizens if they ever want to pay it down.  Less money in the citizens pockets is less money to be spent buying things. This hurts the economy. 
Until the debt is paid down it is an albatross around a country’s neck. Limiting its full potential to do things like rebuild infrastructure and provide useful services.

Well I’m all for it if bitcoin has extremely fast transaction speeds and very low costs. Right now we don’t seem to be there yet.  That’s why I think there needs to be an altcoin with wide adoption to deal with small everyday transactions like buying groceries and coffee etc.   this would be your “checking account”.   Maybe bitcoin could be everything some day. I hope so. I’m all in and having fun.

I know this, bitcoin hasn't moved in a stable predictable rise yet, and there's no reason to think it will start now. It has moved in exponential bursts, each preceded by a pessimistic retraction period.
This will be the sixth such time we have done so, and we are growing increasingly efficient at it.
I want you to go ahead and start thinking about what you will do, and how you will act when the 'unthinkable' occurs. Because the unthinkable is always right around the corner.

Sorry to hear that.  I don’t let the negative stories bother me too much.  People need to stop worrying about short term ups and downs of the market. Of course it’s highly volatile right now.

@_date: 2018-07-27 13:59:29
So what’s keeping price from dropping back to the 6k range right now?  That etf news was a pretty harsh blow to our bullish momentum.  
Is the fact that we stabilized at the low 6k range with a possible bottom in the high 5k range instilling some confidence in the market? I think it could be that and upwards pressure from the long term growth trend.   I’ve felt we have been kept down artificially for months like a balloon being held underwater against its buoyancy. 
What other factors are in play?

It is not just blind optimism if you look at the many factors that make it probable that we will be at 100k+ in year 2021. 
Just the log chart factor alone should be pretty persuasive:
The long term log trend has us at least at 100k by 2021 and that’s being conservative. 
Ask yourself this, is it more likely that we should all of a sudden drastically alter course in 2018 when we have been heading in this direction since 2010?  Or is it more probable that we will continue on the same path?  The fundamentals are good. The outlook is bright and getting brighter all the time.

Follow the golden rule not to invest more than you can afford to lose and you have no reason to fear.   
Also want to add, if you are facing debt and financial troubles you should listen to Dave Ramsey. He can really help you out.

So I (Mr. Daily Hopium himself) had a moment today when I looked at my overall crypto portfolio and felt sick due to the amount of money I have lost (even on promising alt coins).  It has been a long 6 months.
Short term predictions from prominent  leaders in the field are not panning out so far this year.
I have no doubt that bitcoin will succeed in due time, but unless something changes soon, I fear we are in for a long haul ahead. Perhaps similar to the crawl up after the 2014 bear market.  It's starting to feel like that anyway.  Maybe my nausea is a sign that the market will turn around soon.  If not, I don't expect to see a major bull run until we see institutional investment jump on board, or worse, by the halvening in 2020.
My prediction of $100,000 bitcoin within 3 years (early 2021) still stands, it's just not going to happen overnight in my opinion.  I am still sticking to my plan to hodl and keep buying as I can.  Just trying to keep it real...

Just to elaborate more on my shopping experience with Bitcoin yesterday:
Last night I [bought greek food]( with bitcoin.   When I went to pick up my order, the cashier was confused why I used [menufy.com]( instead of grubhub.  I used the moment to expound upon the virtues of bitcoin.  She had heard about bitcoin, but didn't know much about it or how it could be used to buy stuff.  She said she'd check it out.
I was on a bit of a roll, and also ordered some outdoor furniture from overstock.com with bitcoin.  Only paid a $0.05 mining transaction fee  (similar for the greek food above).  Order was confirmed, no problems.  Waiting for my stuff to arrive.
Overall, once you get used to funding and using a wallet, this stuff is not hard at all.Next step is we need to educate and convince the merchants to sell us stuff at a discount since they don't have to pay the expensive transaction fees that credit card companies charge.

Didn't mean to steal your thunder, I just came across the article today during a search, and it reminded me of the endlessly repeating pattern of Bitcoin bubbles followed by naysayers saying I told you so (even while prices were at multiples higher than pre-bubble).

No. You are overthinking this.  I am simply asking bulls and bears alike  to match my bet. So you’d pay whatever I have to pay on May 1, 2021.  If the bear thinks bitcoin will be worth $1 in bitcoin by that date and it actually does crash to that level then the bear pays $1 in bitcoin because that’s all I’d be required to pay too.  Obviously I expect it to be far higher. Read the bet post.

Looks like the action is likely to begin in late August or in the fall:
However, the most important date in the upcoming three months for the entire crypto space is pegged for the SEC hearing on Bitcoin ETFs scheduled for mid-August.
The CBOE applied to allow ETFs entrance into purchasing BTC directly (this is vastly different than future contracts). When the CBOE received approval to begin trading futures contracts of BTC last year BTC ended its bear market and rallied from under $2,000 to $20,000.
The SEC has denied prior ETF applicants due to their lack of insurance and lack of infrastructure, the CBOE has met both these requirements. If the SEC were to approve a party to begin ETF purchasing of crypto, whom better than the CBOE? The bear market should begin to rebound due to ETFs entering the crypto market, along with hundreds of billions of dollars in institutional money.
As more and more cryptos prove to be secure, transparent and successful, there will likely be a rally in the next few months. Experts predict that this rally will not happen until the fourth quarter of 2018 unless the SEC does approve ETF entrance into the crypto space (which if I were a betting man, I’d say the CBOE meets the stringent SEC requirements).

Hodl doesn’t mean don’t ever spend it.  It means don’t panic sell on the dips/crashes. 
At this early stage of adoption, there will be a lot of price volatility.  Any bitcoin spent by an individual should be immediately repurchased with new fiat to avoid losing out on gains. 
At later stages of adoption (when lightning network will become necessary) the price will become less volatile.  It will still grow, but much more gradually.  This would make it unnecessary to immediately replace with new fiat to avoid losses as the short term losses would be minor.

This guy has an interesting take on the cycle of bitcoin bubbles.  He compares our latest bubble to the one in 2011.  I tend to disagree and think this is more like the 2014 bear market.  Still, he sees stability and recovery in store for us later in the year.  I think he's right on that.

I can understand your feelings of fomo but as a matter of perspective please keep in mind a $1000 investment in bitcoin is not going to make you rich.  
Even the most extreme prediction by mcafee of 1 million by end of 2020 will only get you to about $100k.

Don’t be like the two guys below.  This could be your moment to shine.  Bitcoin is on the low side of a major correction like it has done many times before.  All I know is, I’m still buying.  Are you?

I went to a hackerspace in SF back in 2011. Me and some of the guys went to the bar across the way and talked about bitcoin over a few beers. The party was separated into two camps: one who was holding BTC already and advocated for others to do the same, and the others who put their nose up at the idea. Sadly I was a part of the second group...
In a few years, you don’t wanna be visiting the site below and wish you bought some bitcoin while it was cheap.  But instead you were a coward and never bought, or panic sold it all.

For those of you that think I’m a fomo troll, idgaf. 
As a reminder, this is just one of the potential things that could spark ⚡️ the next bull run: 
The cboe backed VanEck-SolidX etf which is backed by physical bitcoin has a good chance of SEC approval by March 2019.  Everyone is watching this one. This would be a big deal for bitcoin.

Yes by offering a discount to bitcoin users it would be a win win.  Merchant pays less or zero transaction fee, and consumer gets a nice discount.  My incentive to use my credit card goes away.  Plus I never have to worry about a credit card number getting stolen. I also have more privacy.

The real problem for retailers has been that it takes too long to process a bitcoin transaction.  That has finally been solved with lightning network.  Lightning just came out this year in beta.  It will change everything once all the kinks are worked out. 
So now you have to restart the clock on your assessment of whether bitcoin has succeeded. Once the efficiency of lightning can be demonstrated to retailers, adoption will be a no-brainer. 
If a few more years have passed and we’re still in the same boat, then I’d be worried.

It appears as if Coinbase upon failing to debit an account through ACH (say there arent enough funds) will try again. This didn't used to happen. So I placed an order to make up for the one I thought would cancel when I saw the failed ACH debit and overdraft in my account. Nope, now I have an extra 11 btc. No more than a month ago this wasn't part of the functionality that I experienced in this situation.
Oh well, guess I'll have to wait a week for those 11 btc to get in and then sell them for 290.

There is plenty of good news for bitcoin through year end on the retail and institutional front.  This is simply market manipulation to bring the price lower.  I don’t think it will last long.

Further clarification:  if I lose the bet, I will donate one bitcoin (whatever it is worth on May 1, 2021) to the charity.  So if it is worth $99,999 on that day then the charity gets one bitcoin at that price from me. 
If I win the bet (bitcoin surpasses 100k sometime between now and May 1, 2021 then I get to decide how much I will donate.  It will be at least enough to buy one track chair (~15k). 
I’m not going to commit to give one whole bitcoin even if I win.  The price of one bitcoin could be a lot higher that 100k by then and I may not want to give that much. But again, I will donate at least one track chair in that instance. Perhaps more depending on my prerogative. 
The charity wins either way though. It wins bigger the higher the price goes, as long as it doesn’t surpass 100k by my date. 
However, don’t be surprised if bitcoin moons beyond 100k  and I’m feeling extra generous at that point. 
@_date: 2018-07-31 18:40:32
The log trend has been our friend for 9 years.  It consistently grows year over year and has been a reliable predictor of future growth.  I see nothing that has changed about the fundamentals of bitcoin to reverse that trend.  I see things that are finally getting close to happening now (institutional investment) that would accelerate that growth. Not to mention lightning network on its way.

It’s not just FUD.  The fundamental problem that the sec stated was the possibility of manipulating the market price in countries with little to no regulation on the exchanges.  
If the cboe proposal has a good counter argument to that then I see a good chance to get it approved.  If not, I’m struggling to find a reason why the sec would change their tune so soon.

So you say...  but I would not want to be the one with my pants down when the big green dildos appear out of nowhere.   This market can be extremely unpredictable and almost anything can happen.  I feel much safer hodling. At least I know how much I could lose that way and I can accept that. 
The prospect of missing the next bitcoin shuttle and being left on the sidelines is too great a risk for me to take.

Not only was it first, but it is the most well known and has greatest market share.  It is this market share dominance and the vast network of miners it sustains that helps protect it from being taken over by bad actors.  Combined with its truly decentralized nature it it can afford an individual greater financial freedom and privacy than a token with a centralized structure.

I’m gonna ask them if they can make that an option in the future.  We have about 3 years.  I’d like to have a few firm commitments from people on matching my bet before I officially approach the charity.   I’d be surprised if we have tens of thousands of dollars in donation money ready and they couldn’t at least set up a bitcoin wallet to accept.   We’ll see.  If you are looking to donate now then fiat it is I guess.

Incomplete info. Only one etf proposal has been delayed. The rest are still up for decision next month. 
Notably, none of the ETF proposals being postponed are from VanEck and SolidX, which are currently under discussion by the wider crypto community. More than 100 comments have been submitted for that proposal, and a decision may occur as soon as next month.

Here, have some Historical Perspective:
 
I held tight during the long bear market, with absolute confidence that the price would find a non-zero bottom, and it would only be up from there. The ecosystem was growing, the technology was maturing, and investment money was pouring in, and yet the price continued to decline. I would have loved to buy more, but doing so would have been truly irresponsible from a diversification perspective.
So, have we finally hit bottom in this bear market?  Time will tell.

Ok after reading that article, the dissent from the sec chairwoman, and the Charlie Shrem comment, I’d say we now have a 50/50 chance of seeing the cboe etf get approved. We may be waiting until March 2019 though.

Almost nobody thinks 35k is likely by year end.  Some of us do think it’s possible (not guaranteed) if we get lucky and there is some good news like more institutional investor interest or an etf gets approved.   Barring any serious bad news, we should definitely see it a lot higher than current price by year end based on long term log trend alone. 
Tom Lee’s prediction of 25k by end of 2018 is a pretty good guess IMO.

Steady as she goes, with no major regulatory nightmare or another major country banning it and generating FUD.  Getting the etf approved would definitely get us there. 
I think we could still see 30k by year end if no major disaster occurs.  No guarantees 
@_date: 2018-07-17 20:59:41
Looks promising but we have to break 10k and then 11.8k to be sure. 
@_date: 2018-07-06 01:42:24
In 4 years they’ll be a guy/gal like me looking back on posts from now.   S/he will quote people who bought at 19000 that either panic sold somewhere along the descent to 5700 or held on and bought more.  The price will be north of 100,000 by then and they’ll probably be facing another dip/crash. 
And in x years from then the cycle will repeat. 
Only thing is, by then bitcoin will be north of 350,000.   And some years later the cycle will repeat.   Then price will be north of one million. 
Meanwhile by then I will be happily retired - early. Enjoying my secluded house in the country while completing my latest invention.   Maybe I’ll stop by this Reddit to say hi �� and reminisce.  Hope some of you will have followed my lead and have freed yourselves from the matrix by then.  ��

In the early stages, retailers will use bitcoin payment conversion services like bitpay that immediately convert the bitcoin payment to fiat so that they don’t lose money. This is already happening.  I am already buying food and merchandise this way. 
As price becomes less volatile (it will take years for this to happen) then retailers will no longer need to rely on services like bitpay. They will be able to accept bitcoin directly without worrying about a BGD and BRD as these will no longer be happening.  Whales will have an extremely difficult time manipulating price as the masses will stabilize the system.

There’s definitely a huge upside potential with bitcoin.   Not sure where we are headed right now in the short term. Right now we are above 9k.  We have failed to break 10k over the past few days.  If we can’t do it by Saturday night then we could see another pullback to 8.7k levels.

Coinbase pro exchange fees are 0 with limit orders.  
Ultimately we’d want the world to evolve to the point where merchants would no longer want to convert back to fiat.  They’d keep the bitcoin which would increase in price over time due to its deflationary nature.   We are talking years here before this is likely to start happening.

This is good for bitcoin 
@_date: 2018-04-16 19:27:01
To be honest, I wouldn’t mind if it just stayed here  in the 8k range for a few months while I accumulate more.  It’s just more fun when it goes up obviously. 
@_date: 2018-04-06 15:53:22
Once the reality that we are at or close to bottom sinks in there is going to be a rush of smart money back in that’s going to shock a lot of people.  The question is, how soon.

@_date: 2018-04-04 18:20:50
175k per coin in 5 years.   Adoption wise you will start to see it accepted by major online retailers like amazon. Probably see it being accepted at Whole Foods and target and Walmart type retailers as well.  People will just pay using the bitcoin wallet bar code on their smart phone.    The prices will still be in local currency (e.g usd) but you can pay the total bill in bitcoin.  Similar to Apple Pay.       
Bonus: in 10 years bitcoin will be 300k+

I’d be happy with low 9’s at this point.  Trying not to be too greedy.  Hurry up money transfer.

YES! They brought back the gdax color scheme on Coinbase pro.  I hated the new colors there. 
@_date: 2018-07-04 18:23:37
Daily Hopium:
Price is looking good.  I think the bulls need to get it over 6.8k and it would finally show an upward trend above the last high ($6829.06) on the Coinbase Pro 1 day chart.
This article says the fireworks will begin once we get back into the 7k range:

I guess in light of the big moves over the past few days these just seem pointless.

I set a stop around 7885 when it was over 8000 and it sold while I was at work. With some quick maneuvering I was able to rebuy 10 bucks higher with a small fee. Not terrible but annoying.  I’m learning and i appreciate your insights. Thanks.

This is an impressive pump. Hope none of you guys shorted. 
@_date: 2018-04-10 21:53:46
Same here. Now is the time.  Can’t cry later when price is over 20k.   “Oh poor me, how could I have missed out on buying in early 2018?”   
It happened to me that I didn’t even know about bitcoin until December 2017.  I am determined to never miss another opportunity like that again.

My gut prediction is it will drop again today and then Friday will gradually rise (might pump too). Probably dip on Sunday.  Within the next two weeks we’ll start to see a genuine organic bull market starting once USA taxes are paid on April 17th.  I’m planning to rebuy and hold on next dip.

@_date: 2018-04-20 22:55:06
Well I predicted 8700+ by Friday night as well. Most people waaaaaay under called it.

As long as Mt Gox guy doesn’t sell, we are likely to break 10k next weekend. I think we’ll stay in the 9k range this week.   Once we break through 10k that will make the news and the fomo will be strong. 
@_date: 2018-04-10 14:42:28
At least we’re not dropping. ��
@_date: 2018-04-05 03:34:06
Actually in my scenario he’d eat his dick either way since bitcoin would have to grow more than 100 times its value to reach 1 million per coin in a little less than 3 years.   I’d love that to be true but I think my prediction of 10-20 times current value by then is more probable.

Reposting here for greater visibility:
So this would be a good opportunity in India for some crypto companies to accept paper fiat in person in exchange for bitcoin (more bitcoin atms ?).  Then the Indian person could do as they please with it. Banks would have been convenient due to ach and wire, but they can’t stop you from doing what you please with you physical paper fiat.  Huge opportunity here if it’s marketed well. 
@_date: 2018-04-05 22:48:01
No I started at 11.2k end of January. 
@_date: 2018-04-17 15:47:42
Because as I have been saying(trying not to be too repetitive), the short term moving average is extremely close to crossing the long term moving average on the gdax 1 day chart.  Once this happens it should increase buying pressure significantly.

Gemini is supposed to be very secure, haven’t tried it myself.  I use gdax ( no fees on limit orders).   Best thing to do once you get your bitcoin for security is buy a hardware wallet like Trezor or Nano. And put your bitcoin on that.

Yeah I think things are going to get a lot better for bitcoin during the next few months. 
@_date: 2018-04-04 20:46:24
I cede that possibility, but bitcoin currently has first mover advantage, publicity, and notable players (Winklevoss twins, John mcafee, Tom lee etc.). Not to mention a vast network of nodes and miners with a vested interest in seeing bitcoin succeed.  IMO bitcoin is unstoppable in the long run.

I agree with most of this; however, I do believe it's OK to day trade a very small percentage of total stack, because it can be fun and if you are good at it, you can accumulate more bitcoin.  It's really just gambling though.  Hodling has worked out better for me so far.

@_date: 2018-04-19 19:01:08
Unless we have an unexpected giant red dildo between now and then, we should see it bump up around then. 
Edit:  may even see a bump a little prior due to the anticipation. Could be why we are higher in the 8200-8300 range currently. 
@_date: 2018-04-14 21:16:38

Believing in bitcoin means believing it will be adopted and used by the masses.  Being adopted leads to higher prices. So no, you do not really believe in what bitcoin should be. It is not meant to be a niche technology.

Green dildos should be coming soon.
@_date: 2018-07-15 00:14:39
I don’t see it completely taking over fiat in our lifetimes.  Maybe 50% at most in 10 years.  There will still be many holdouts (older generations) using credit card and cash for a while.  Price will begin to stabilize at 300k+ due to the sheer number of users at that point.   Much harder for individual whales to substantially affect the price at that level. 
@_date: 2018-07-20 13:39:24
If it stays right here for another 3 months while I accumulate, I wouldn’t mind. 
@_date: 2018-04-04 15:28:57
Nope. I was watching the uptrend over the last few days very closely.  There is significant organic buying interest again I think because some people were expecting freefall below 5k. Didn’t happen.   Bottom is somewhere in the 6k range.   
The reason we are lower today is due to the irrational reaction to sudden FUD of the Chinese tariffs and stock market volatility. This is temporary and really has nothing to do with bitcoin.   I think once this passes bitcoin will continue its steady upward rise until 8k. Then it will accelerate.  I’m hoping for a slow steady rise after that but could start spiking as fomo kicks in.

@_date: 2018-04-06 14:39:47
So far the SEC has been friendly to crypto for the most part.  One thing going for us is the younger generations are far more open to crypto than the older generations.  In the long run the young is likely to put pressure on regulators to allow it to continue.    A dollar coin wouldn’t be embraced unless it is decentralized and capped, which wouldn’t even make sense for the govt to do. That is the whole point of bitcoin. It should not be controlled by any entity. And if it’s not capped then more can be created just like fiat.   
@_date: 2018-07-24 12:04:02
Well I just went full retard and bought more after it broke 8k  when I could have bought last night at 7750. 
@_date: 2018-07-30 19:11:49

So this would be a good opportunity in India for some crypto companies to accept paper fiat in person in exchange for bitcoin (more bitcoin atms ?).  Then the Indian person could do as they please with it. Banks would have been convenient due to ach and wire, but they can’t stop you from doing what you please with you physical paper fiat.  Huge opportunity here if it’s marketed well.

Dude lighten up a little.  When we were heading downwards after the early March MT. Gox dump scare, many people thought we could be headed into the abyss of 3-4k.  The fact that we only hit low 6's and painstakingly crawled back into the high 8's is remarkable.  Trend is good now, that's worth being happy about.

The short term moving average line is about to cross the long term moving average line (upwards) on the gdax one day chart. The lines are currently touching. This usually indicates a large bump is coming. Should happen in about 3.5 hours (or at least it should start happening).

That all depends on when the general public decides they want to adopt bitcoin as the currency of choice.  May take 10+ years. Who knows. 
I do think in 4-5 years we could be at 250k to 300k if it gains traction as gold 2.0.  But I’m not sure.  I’m only confident in my 100k by May 1, 2021 prediction because we could get there by speculation and the 2020 halvening alone.

The simple solution to this problem is for more little guys to keep buying the coins from the whales and hold them or spend them. Stop panic selling them back on the market to the whales.

I provided the Hopium for myself as much as my audience.   I needed it too.  Thank you for the kind words. 
The only thing that has changed in my mindset is that I think we have a much longer haul to the next legitimate bull run.   I’m impatient because I have probably over invested, because I thought the next bull run might start this summer.   I was misled by others in the media I felt had some credibility and succumbed to fomo. 
Anyway season one of Daily Hopium has completed as of yesterday.   Giving it a rest for a while.  It will be back.  I have not lost hope but trying to be realistic on expectations.  The 2014 bear market lasted years before it mooned.  We could face that again now.  I see many parallels, as I have illustrated in my posts. 
In some ways this is a blessing because I was lamenting that I missed the boat on bitcoin.  Now I might have plenty of time to dollar cost average my way to financial freedom someday.  Yay, I guess.

So if bitcoin crashes down to $0.01 and there is a circulating supply of 17 million coins then it would cost someone $170,000 to acquire all coins.   A $5k investment at that possible bottom would get you ~3% of all available coins.  A $25k investment would get ~15% of all bitcoin.

The technological leap of solving the Byzantine General’s problem and then applying it to currency is what gives bitcoin its value.  Yes it can be copied, but so can people copy McDonald’s food. Yet most people still go to Mickey D’s.   Bitcoin has the brand recognition which draws users to it.  Bitcoin relies on its large user and miner base to give it strength and to function.  Look at its marketcap dominance over every other cryptocurrency.   This is what makes it superior and protects it from tampering. Other cryptos have small miner and user base and can’t compare.

"Less than 1% of the world’s population — [no more than 40 million people]( — have ever used Bitcoin."  
Just imagine what the price would look like if only 5% of the world started to use bitcoin.  As usage of bitcoin grows we will all begin to truly free ourselves, not just in the third world, but in the first world too.  Fiat currency became obsolete as soon as bitcoin was invented.  The world just hasn't caught on yet to that reality. But it soon will.

That’s very condescending. 


I don’t see that as a problem. I’d rather bitcoin be priced against real world items such as land and camels than a fiat built house of cards. 


One could argue that with the increase in supply of available bread from the POV of the bitcoin village, the residents of the bitcoin village could purchase the bread from the banana village for less bitcoin than would normally be required if buying from their own village.  Banana leaves are not finite as you can grow more bananas, so they are less valuable.  While this is a fun thought experiment I don’t think it applies to any real life scenario.  It assumes all the bitcoin wealth in the world would be concentrated in one group of people.  Obviously this would be a problem. It needs to be distributed among many people to foster a functional economy.

The Bitcoin Critic’s Playbook
This article echos many of the criticisms we have heard frequently from the more articulate bitcoin critics on this subreddit.  It talks about death spirals, 51% attacks, miner capitulation, and generally predicts imminent doom and gloom for bitcoin. 
**Note that it was written nearly 4 years ago**, about one year into the last bear market that lasted ~2 years.  We all know what happened after.  2016-2017 would bring an impressive bull market that caught the attention of the mainstream media and some in the general public.  It’s almost like the article could have been written today if you just add a zero to the end of the bitcoin prices referenced. 
So with the current crop of bitcoin critics that pop up in every bear market, sooner or later they need to ask themselves, why do they keep getting it so wrong?
Long live the King of Crypto.  ���� Long live bitcoin!

At the time of this writing, the price of one bitcoin is above $7,200.  The sentiment here is getting very bullish again, indeed.  Since I found out about bitcoin very late back in January 2018, I never had the chance to experience the euphoria that took place during 2017.  Looks like latecomers like me are finally getting that opportunity.  The last few days the price has been soaring and my bitcoin portfolio is finally back in the green after a long time.

2) sell all your vast holdings of btc and crash the market to 0. Then pump Faketoshi coin to show it’s the real bitcoin.

I’m still here and hodling. I am unfazed by this price action and looking forward to my next purchase at month end. 
@_date: 2018-12-03 22:14:48
Well I would take one for the team and buy some more right now but my usd funds are “on hold” at Coinbase.  It won’t let me transfer from my usd wallet to Coinbase pro (to have no fees).  I am resistant to paying the stupid Coinbase fees. 
Last time I did this I had no problem with holds. My bank transfer was instant. 
Edit:  so apparently they changed it so that when you deposit usd directly from bank account into Coinbase usd wallet, those funds get placed on hold for five business days.   Boo!
I’m getting an itchy buy finger tho so I’ll probably end up paying the fees. I want some $3.8k priced bitcoin

I am extremely confident we will get at least one more major bull run. It may take two bull runs to get us to $100k.  Beyond that I have high hopes, but a lot will depend on how receptive the general public is to hodling and using it as a currency.

**Fun fact of the day:**
The last bitcoin bottom was found on January 14, 2015 at $171.51
Bitcoin is currently ~$3,915 
That is a ~22.82x  or 2,182% increase since the last bottom.  And this is true even after almost one year of a grueling bear market.  
This is the advantage of buying when there is blood on the streets and long term hodling.
@_date: 2019-05-10 02:59:02
Too soon for me, but I did the best I could
@_date: 2018-12-07 18:53:25
Oh believe me if it ever hits zero I will not need to use much fiat to acquire enough bitcoin to make a fortune later.    By buying all the way down and hodling I am basically insuring that if it suddenly rebounds then I will not miss out. 
@_date: 2018-12-20 01:10:59
Not selling any until $100k 
@_date: 2018-12-17 19:58:59
Yeah that’s what I thought too. A few weeks ago I did just that and cb would not let me move the usd to cb pro until 5 business days. They put a hold on the money.  Of course I could buy directly on cb and pay the fees, which I did - angrily. 
Edit:  the problem I had above last time, seems to be resolved. I was able to buy more today instantly 
@_date: 2018-12-07 19:01:16
Well, we disagree on that. You think bitcoin is dead. There’s plenty of evidence that bitcoin has been declared dead many times before, and yet it matches on.   Check out the bitcoin obituaries at 
So I think bitcoin will recover from this crash just as it always has. And when it does, yippee! to my wallet. 
@_date: 2018-12-07 14:45:56
You won’t hear that from me. I’m buying at all levels. Bought at 6200. $5500,  $4200, $3800.  I’ll buy all the way down to f*cking zero.   See you in paradise in a few years 
@_date: 2019-05-15 15:41:41

If you are still here hodling, congratulations! ������. You made it through the scariest and most grueling crashes in bitcoin history.  By many accounts the bottom is in and we have entered the accumulation phase.   I’m calling this your Last Chance Phase (LCP).  This may be the last year that a regular working class person can afford to buy a whole bitcoin.  
2020 is around the corner.  It will be the beginning of an epic bull run that we’ve all been waiting for.  Good luck everyone ����

Too many variables in 2019 to predict price during that year. I do think we will find bottom (if not already found) and will end 2019 significantly higher than we will begin it. 2020 will be the year bitcoin really shines.

I don’t see why it can’t eventually graduate beyond just being a store of value and replace fiat entirely.  It’s infinitely easier to transact in bitcoin than it ever was in gold. That’s why, in time, bitcoin can become a usable currency.  It has to stabilize first though. We will need to ride the rollercoaster many times more before that happens.

Nothing you said in your post is factually accurate.  Neither I (nor to the best of my knowledge cryptogrip) made any such prediction of a 2018 bull run. 
My prediction is and always has been $100k by May 1, 2021. I stand by it. 
P.S. if you look through my posts all year I said a new bull run could only be confirmed if we break $12k.

@_date: 2018-12-31 17:05:44
The lowest bitcoin has ever crashed was about 92% due to a hacking of Mt. Gox exchange and manipulation of the price down to 0.01.  
Miners have already turned off their rigs because it has become unprofitable to mine for most people at these prices.  I just don’t want to see it crash too much further.  Unless my understanding is completely off base, losing more miners does not seem like a good thing for bitcoin.  I’d prefer not to have to wait 20 years for it to recover from a snowballing catastrophe. 
@_date: 2018-12-07 18:56:00

When bitcoin finally reaches the hard pavement bottom, how fast do you think this thing is going to rocket back up above $6k? Or do you think we’ll linger at the bottom for a while?   I say when bottom hits it will be a matter of days until we bounce back up several $1000s 
@_date: 2019-05-10 19:02:38

The worth is in the future value of the technology to changing the financial sector.  It’s a disruptive technology in its infancy.  I’m pessimistic short term due to market trend, but very optimistic mid term (beyond 3 years). And partly optimistic long term (&gt;10 years).  Right now it is more of a speculative asset with enormous growth potential as opposed to a currency.  It has a solid track record over the last 9 years of early stage logarithmic growth. It has crashed several times by ~90% and always comes back higher after the bear markets ends. It might take a couple more years, but this time will be no different 
@_date: 2018-12-26 21:53:24
I dunno about you but I’m buying as much as I can at these levels.  
@_date: 2019-05-15 15:06:40
I have been saying for over a year that $12k is the number to watch for because it was the highest top we’ve had (with multiple tests) since the crash. 
Breaking $10k would be psychologically significant, because it would likely spread through the media and induce fomo.  We would quickly make it to $12k after that.  If $12k is broken then all hell is about to break loose.
Also if you look at the long term logarithmic chart it becomes clear we are in a logarithmic growth curve that approaches $100k by 2021
@_date: 2019-05-31 01:07:54
Been holding since Jan 2018. Lost &gt;60% of my money.  Gained it all back and then some. That’s how bitcoin rolls. The cool part for you is we’re heading into a bull market ��

Well it’s a speculative question.  The last time we hit bottom in January 2015 it made a nice bounce back above $200 very quickly.

I am just going based on previous trend.  If the institutions all of a sudden fomo into bitcoin and an etf gets approved we could possibly hit mcafee’s one million number. Not sure when tho. Anything is possible with bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-05-10 18:22:23
It certainly seems that way.  Very bullish.  I am waiting for the break through of $12k and then it’s truly moon time
@_date: 2019-05-10 16:52:40
@_date: 2018-12-07 17:14:38
Lol. I get more bitcoins every time price goes lower.  So when price eventually moons again I’ll be in a great position.   The general public will return once they see a bottom and price rising again. Then they will fomo back in but they will have missed the best gains already. They’ll still make money but it’s the difference between buying bitcoin in early 2015 at $170 ish or waiting to buy with the crowd at $4000 in 2017.  Which people do you think got richer by December 2017? 
@_date: 2019-05-29 23:52:44
@_date: 2018-12-31 15:29:35
It’s not a safe investment by any means; however, it is likely the safest cryptocurrency since it has a 9 year track record of amazing growth. It has steep peaks and valleys, but eventually continues to rise higher.  Google the logarithmic growth chart for bitcoin since 2009 and you will see what I am talking about.  
If you think bitcoin will continue its growth (like I do) then IMO it is a great time to invest.  It has dropped nearly 85% from its ATH. Typically a bullish reversal eventually follows an 85% drop.  Be prepared to hold for at least three years if you decide to invest.

I get that, but the more miners we have the more secure the network is from 51% attack, right? So we should all be rooting for the price of bitcoin to rise so that more miners join the bitcoin network and it grows stronger. If I’m incorrect, please let me know.

True, but I think that should be considered an outlier. Mt. Gox was hacked and the price was artificially driven down to $0.01.
