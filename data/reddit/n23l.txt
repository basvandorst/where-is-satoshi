They are trying to confuse people that is starting to buy crypto currencies. In general this is a clear sign of dishonesty.

I do, problem is that I can't buy any more bitcoins. Banks are closing accounts if they know you are buying bitcoins.
I guess banks are a little scared... that's good.

Second, buy &amp; HODL

The best idea and the most secure one will win.
Do not think in profit, think in freedom and decentralization. That's the key to take the power from the 1%

I think you cant tied a cryptocurrency to a hard asset and expect it to be stable.
the demand and the offer of a new cryptocurrency create the volatility, and more important the volume. Someone can increase/decrease the value of a cryptocurrency if they have enough 'money' to buy/sell.
Only a big marketcap and a high volume will make a cryptocurrency stable. Bitcoin is going on that direction.
compare bitcoin now and 6 year ago volatility

What was you thinking? any idea to improve it? or which is your approach? I think that Follow My Vote project is great but I do not like to has a key that reflect my vote, but if I can check the results of my vote I would be the only one who knows for who I voted.
