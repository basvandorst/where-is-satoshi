hmm but can't they do it already on bitmex (for example) by using the leverage? 
@_date: 2018-01-03 11:45:44
I only know what's publicly shared by them, so just follow on social media
@_date: 2018-01-01 04:13:36
Man, that's tough. Have you considered moving? (if it's even possible)
@_date: 2017-12-20 12:25:21
Potentially billion $ to win!
@_date: 2017-12-14 04:01:05
who declared it?
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:34:32
Great post. True believers will never sell and now hopefully they acquired even more coins, making BTC stronger.

Yes Bitcoin invention seems to me like the act of divine intervention!
@_date: 2017-12-13 09:17:44
God bless them if they do.

Wherever they need bitcoin

@_date: 2017-12-29 12:45:32
why not?
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:24:34
Brilliant! :D

Well if you insisting on converting to USD then yes. But they'd have as much BTC as they had before and I doubt they'd sell it for USD, because.... wth for? Don't they have enough of this coin already?

Great work!

Are you talking about Mike Hearn?
@_date: 2017-12-08 06:50:12
C'mon they already have that! Silently tapping to our satellites...

If you believe it has value, don't *just* hodl - support it (ie run a full node), spread the message and invite others to the party.
@_date: 2017-12-14 00:48:22
Eventually - yes :) once all the 'old' countries will be on the network. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 02:30:32
Gotta spend some eventually... otherwise how else other ppl that weren't able to buy in early will ever get on the network? And it will be increasingly harder for them with time, since fiat will be decreasing in value. So put some life in the ecosystem - pay for goods and services in BTC if you already have nice BTC stash/
@_date: 2017-12-13 08:07:10
Hopefully, by that time they will still have enough fiat to buy in into the market.

This doesn't really drive adoption but an interesting option nonetheless.
@_date: 2017-12-14 00:53:43
Someone gets it!
@_date: 2017-12-19 04:21:38
Very interesting discussion! Thanks for sharing
@_date: 2017-12-14 01:56:52
Shameless fiat pump! He's in for a surprise.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:03:49
If you're not trading using leverage then there's nothing to worry about.
@_date: 2017-12-21 06:03:44
he's actually betting it's gonna be way above 50k

Aren't governments made of people too? Don't get me wrong I am all for citizens to accumulate as many BTC as possible but (at least in my country) many people rely on the government for healthcare, sanitation and many other things. Would that collapse one day because of bitcoin explosion people will inevitably suffer IMO. And government collapse in one country might be a golden opportunity for your 'friendly' neighbours to send forces to 'help' you. So I'd prefer peaceful handing over of power.
@_date: 2017-12-14 00:50:33
If that's the case then it's not gonna end well for them, and for people who trust their government :/
@_date: 2017-12-17 04:51:04
This is brilliant, thanks for sharing!
