That's a risk you take when making such an investment. They knew what they were getting into when doing so. 
@_date: 2014-03-09 12:45:12
Well, if you're talking about mainstream media, then you're right. That's because they aren't media outlets at all - they're propaganda outlets owned by the elite that control the government as well.

I live in Thailand and BTC was never really banned. There have been other exchanges, namely [BahtCoin]( running uninterrupted for quite some time. With that said, this is a much better exchange and I'm glad it's back.

He's saying that the ATM checks for the current price of BTC every couple of minutes and uses that. A lot of ATMs only update their price every hour or only once a day.

VTC is actually ASIC and mining pool resistant and specifically created to be.

Be careful investing in Bitcoin because it's possible it's just a passing fad and could be replaced by a better crypto currency later. See how silly this post is?

While the best thing would definitely be for Gox to disappear, the worst thing would be for all their customers to lose all their BTC and fiat. Can you imagine the media shit storm and the confidence lost in the market? 
@_date: 2014-01-20 03:48:43
Agreed. Even relative to Bitcoin, it's not a lot of money. 
However, it is great to see South Korea getting involved, as they should use it a lot as a population - they are the most connected country out there when it comes to internet usage.
@_date: 2014-02-17 11:42:47
Not necessarily. They're losing more and more of the market share as time goes on. They'll eventually fade away into nothingness, but for now, they're going to be here. They'll probably have less than 10% market share after this is over. They used to have 90%. Any experienced user will be getting out as soon as they can and they'll have nothing but people who don't pay attention to the actual market trading there. Which there will be less and less of.

A dodgy meme coin? Are you even trying? Haha
@_date: 2014-03-04 07:00:35
The financial system as it exist nowadays? Of course it does. The current financial systems relies on money created from debt and centrally managed. Bitcoin completely turns that upside down. It's silly to say it doesn't have the potential to - though you could make the argument it might not.
@_date: 2014-02-25 03:25:33
This is great news. I'm glad to hear not everyone is getting totally screwed by Gox. I hope a lot of other people followed your same strategy and came out on top as well. We all know Gox did, as they manipulated everything. 
@_date: 2014-02-20 12:05:59
Yeah it's totally fucked up. Entrapment is what these agencies are all about now. Look at all the "terrorist plots" that the FBI has foiled since 9/11. Every single one was initiated and egged on by the FBI. EVERY SINGLE ONE.

There was and has been Bitcoin trading in Thailand. [BahtCoin]( has been running this entire time. BTC was never actually made illegal in Thailand in the first place. One guy from the central bank - which doesn't make laws - said he thinks it should be illegal, and the whole world freaked out. 
@_date: 2014-02-16 15:17:58
Unfortunately this is more likely than Gox doing the right thing and fixing the issues at hand. It's becoming more and more obvious to everyone watching that Gox is repeatedly tanking the market on purpose so they can profit from it.

They've done over $1m of sales in BTC in two months, so it's definitely working!
Imagine how much more that will be when the mainstream adopts BTC!
@_date: 2014-03-07 04:06:27
This. The previous people who said they exposed Satoshi didn't do anything compared to what Newsweek is doing here. This puts Dorian's life at risk in a major way. If I was the real Satoshi, I'd want to put out some sort of statement here - whereas it certainly wasn't necessary during the previous "Satoshi exposed" claims.

And PayPal has the ability to freeze your account whenever they want for any arbitrary reason and never give you your money back - something they do on a regular basis. 
@_date: 2014-02-17 10:33:40
Absolutely not. There was never a single law passed in Thailand concerning Bitcoin. All of this stemmed from what one dude at the Ministry of Finance said a long time ago and it being misrepresented as law. They aren't even capable of making laws, they just enforce already existing ones.

Something about this is fishy. But of course, the government can't be lying to us again!
Also, the same tired narrative over and over again. "Criminals are using it to buy illegal goods!" You know, since they've never used dollars for that. Yawwwwnnnnnnnnn!

I'm sorry to everyone that lost money. It's terrible what Gox has done and we should all do everything possible to bring them to justice for their crimes. However, in the end, BTC is much better off now that those scumbags are no longer manipulating the market at every chance they get.

I can't fault the companies for this, it's just sad. These companies have VC funding and a lot to think about. They're already in risky territory being in police-state America and dealing with a technology that has the potential to destroy the financial system as it exists today.

As someone who lives in Thailand, you know absolutely nothing about Thailand. Stop watching bullshit Western propaganda that does nothing but scare people and try to distract them from what's going on in their own country. 
In addition, you don't seem to know anything at all about BTC. Anyone wanting to be anonymous and commit crimes would be much safer using cash. Back into the hole you crawled out of!
@_date: 2014-02-18 02:28:12
Absolutely! I was just talking about in day to day transactions. There's definitely a huge credit and housing bubble getting ready to burst here in Thailand. How's Chonburi treating you?
@_date: 2014-02-17 12:48:18
Unfortunately there really aren't any. I'm going to be working on changing that over the next couple of months here. I'll report back when I make some progress!
@_date: 2014-02-17 14:33:01
Thailand is very much a cash-based economy. Credit cards are used here a lot less frequently than in many other countries I've been. Once it takes off and people realize it's like cash but better, I think Thailand is a massive opportunity for growth in the crypto space. 
In addition, the ASEAN pact is starting up this next year and since people from all ASEAN countries will now be able to work and travel freely around the region, a currency such as BTC that could be used in all countries easily would make a lot of sense to be adopted by businesses in all ASEAN countries - especially in the tourism/entertainment sectors.

Exactly. A business shouldn't be required to make all their financial details public if they're a private company. If the market demands it of certain companies, then they will give the market what they demand.

Multiple ISPs all giving their information over to the NSA. America is by far the most Orwellian of all countries around and the police state is rapidly swallowing everything alive in America. There was also a law signed that says the government can kidnap you at any time if you are "a terrorist or provide material support to terrorists" and keep you indefinitely without even telling anyone they took you. Not to mention the fact that the President has a kill list and already killed four American citizens with drone strikes without any due process of law.

Once you do the complete verification process on Coinbase, you'll be able to buy and sell BTC instantly. You have to remember that it's impossible to do a chargeback with BTC, so these companies are accepting a lot of risk when they take your ACH deposit and give you BTC in return.
