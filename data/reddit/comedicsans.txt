The only party with a stance on Bitcoin is the most virulent anti-business, pro-regulation, unconventional economics (read: hippy dippy bullshit)? 
Advertising a Greens endorsement is the worst thing possible. Particularly when it's tied to something as nonsensical as a 3d printing hub. They should stick to ecotourism as their only economic platform because they sound like complete idiots when they veer into anything else.

Why stop there? You could purpose build secure facilities which cater for Bitcoin in particular - less room necessary, since you're not storing large property, it could have all kinds of neat security features, could be designed to prevent employee theft of said valuables, and could have tellers to allow the easy and safe retrieval and divestment of Bitcoins to their respective owners!

Responsible is as close to zero as possible, given its volatility. Practically, it probably means "as close to zero (as long as converting it and then converting it back for payday is not inefficient)".
Holding Bitcoins is not wise for a company that will have to pay creditors on the hoof, when those creditors don't take Bitcoin and will have contracts bound in fiat. Having a reserve in Bitcoin is all well and good until the price crashes the day before you're due to pay a massive debt in fiat. Then you're fucked.

@_date: 2015-01-09 18:16:11
Why? It just means they'll buy x amount on payday and immediately flick it off to whichever employee wants their pay in Bitcoin. All its doing is shifting the burden of paying for the fiat-to-Bitcoin conversion. 
@_date: 2015-01-09 18:32:26
I didn't get the sense he was talking about a fiat contract that would simply be converted on the day, otherwise why call his boss an idiot for not considering Bitcoin? You could ask to receive your salary in lottery tickets, too, but it doesn't make your boss an idiot for saying no.
@_date: 2015-01-09 19:48:42
Doubt it. They'd want to be liquid so they can pay their creditors. Sequestering money in Bitcoins for two weeks between pay cycles is bad business, since it means they basically can't touch it for no reason and it's subject to any fluctuations in the market, which lately haven't exactly been in Bitcoin's favour.
Their accountant would be having kittens if they tried that.

He didn't say whether his contract is negotiated in Bitcoin or whether it's in fiat but converted to Bitcoin on payday. Further up the thread people are claiming these arrangements force employers to hold sums of Bitcoin, which doesn't seem likely at all, but I'm trying to clarify.

@_date: 2015-01-09 18:12:27
How does that make sense? If he'd agreed to pay you in Bitcoin and the price then spiked to $1000, he'd have fucked the company. Conversely, if you'd signed up to an employment contract on the assumption Bitcoin would remain near $1000, you'd be homeless today.
@_date: 2015-01-09 19:33:26
Hardly. The people who want their pay in Bitcoin would've bought Bitcoin anyway. Otherwise why ask for it?
@_date: 2015-01-15 18:04:28
Trouble with a world map? Oh come now, you can do better than that. I'm sure the people who put valuable assets into the hands of Magic: the Gathering Online Exchange and expect it to be safe have both active imaginations and a sense of humour.
@_date: 2015-01-09 18:04:59


How does that follow? It'd make more sense for them to add a step in their two-weekly payment run and convert to Bitcoin on the day, so they get the exchange rate exactly right. Unless they're negotiating employment contracts in Bitcoin (and they won't be), so the contract will be in fiat, so the only way to ensure accuracy is to hold fiat and convert on the day payment is due.
@_date: 2015-01-09 19:44:44
Only the staff who opt in, at their own request. And if they're requesting payment in Bitcoin, it's presumably because they'd have bought Bitcoins themselves. 
All it means is that people who'd have bought coins anyway now get their employer to do it for them. There's no real new demand there. And even if there is, at maximum it's 1400 people, since that's all Overstock employs. This sub is bigger than that.

What's the point in holding? Maybe the day before payday, but that's about it. Otherwise you run the risk of not having cash to pay amounts owing.
@_date: 2015-01-09 18:56:37
Why? The contact is in dollars, he's got every right to insist in payment in dollars. If someone wants Bitcoin so badly they can purchase it themselves and incur the transaction costs. The boss is being prudent for saying no.
@_date: 2015-01-01 20:53:00
The ordinary people didn't have 650,000 coins go missing, maybe they feel they don't need educating on this particular issue?
@_date: 2015-01-09 19:23:43
Risky. The couldn't guarantee a supply, and more than likely they don't hold onto them for very long, particularly when Overstock's supplier, landlords etc expect payment in fiat. There's no benefit in holding Bitcoin when you have bills to pay in fiat, and a crapload of risk. 
@_date: 2015-01-15 15:40:51
The obvious answer is that a government backs their own currency. A government with assets (usually in the billions or trillions of dollars worth), and guaranteed revenue streams through taxation. If a currency flounders the government is able to back it by flogging off state assets.
An internet currency is backed by sunshine and happy thoughts. Oh, and child porn and drugs. And since its so inextricably linked to the dark markets for shady shit, merely holding Bitcoin looks shady. Why would the average person switch from a government backed currency to one that's inextricably tied up with drugs and child porn? And when they don't, no new money comes in, bitcoin dies.
@_date: 2015-01-09 22:08:07
So enough to cover possible refunds of faulty goods, etc? Makes sense to keep a small reserve, I suppose, although still leaves them open to risk if/when the value plunges.
Edit: I only just realised that Bitcoin purchases account for below 0.1% of Overstock's revenue and transactions, as per the Overstock CE's AMA. Maybe not such a risk, then.
@_date: 2015-01-15 10:19:47


No thanks, I'm not American. 
And will you look at that, Bitcoin is pretty much Europe, the US, and that's about it. It's less global than Ebola.

@_date: 2015-01-09 19:31:50
That doesn't pay their bills in the interim. Not many companies can sit on a payroll's worth of money in between pat cycles without defaulting on other outgoings. 
@_date: 2015-01-06 11:06:30
The exchanges that publish are as open and identifiable as regular banks, except their transactions aren't secured against the bank and the consumer has no protection, and the exchanges that *don't* publish could pilfer anyone's Bitcoins without anyone knowing and without any recourse because, again, there's no security or consumer protections against the exchange.
You know who wins in this situation? The exchange. If they disclose, they're basically a bank (without any of the bank's statutory obligations under consumer protection or banking laws), and if they don't disclose, they have the backup plan of MtGoxing everything and retiring to the Bahamas with nobody the wiser, flogging off the coins in the time between the theft and the discovery.
@_date: 2015-01-15 18:36:20

@_date: 2015-04-19 06:15:23
And just like Bir Tawil, if any idiot blithered in there and tried to claim it, nobody would give a shit and nobody would pay it any attention. The second it's shown to be worth anything, you can be absolutely assured that they'd remember their territorial claims (and the private individuals who have tried to go all pirate king would get fucked over).
@_date: 2015-04-19 02:06:43
Very unlikely. Once Serbia and Croatia actually work out how to settle disputes on the border, I'm sure they'll roll that land up and parcel it out accordingly. The fact neither of them has explicitly claimed it against the other doesn't mean that it's nobody's, ask either government if it's terra nullius and they'd tell you to fuck off.
It's a nice theory. In practice, you've got a fuckload of armed Croats and a fuckload of armed Serbs who have a history of not taking border incursions very well.
@_date: 2015-04-18 23:49:30
That's like saying "if I build a pillow fort and declare myself a nation-state, and it'd be legit *if only it were recognised*..."
Compare this to Kosovo (since it's a direct analogy). Kosovo needed the EU, US and half the friendly nations on the planet to recognise its legitimacy, and even then (and after the Kosovan War!) Russia and Serbia still basically refuse to acknowledge the fact.
In a practical sense, there's no chance in hell this gets legitimacy, and Serbia would see it as an affront to its territorial integrity and probably kill anyone who chose to migrate there, if push came to shove. Serbia's done it before.
