From Satoshi's original source code :

The main purpose of burning energy is not to process transactions... that's a trivial task.
Energy is burned to secure the network. Since burning energy is expensive and cannot be faked, this makes it very difficult for an individual, group or government to overpower the combined energy of the network. It also has the side effect of keeping it decentralised... anybody with electricity can participate in mining.
Bitcoin burns exactly as much energy as is needed to secure the value of the coins in the  network and maintain decentralisation at any given time, so it is extremely energy efficient.

Interesting that his main concern about Bitcoin is its radical non-anonymity. 
Anonymity is something that Lightning adds to bitcoin, and I think is probably the best feature of Lightning. Maybe even more so than its payments efficiency and scalability.

Yes. But the clever thing is that the mathematical task automatically gets more difficult the more miners there are. So it always turns out that a correct guess will be made somewhere in the world approximately every 10 minutes, regardless of how many miners there are.
This was all written in the original software, and hasn't changed since then.

A smartphone can mine 0 hash/sec.
An ASIC can mine 16 Terahash/sec.
16000000000000 / 0 = infinity smartphones

Yep here's the video from May:

LN is enabled at some merchants already. Others coming soon.

Yeah I think you're right. The attacker  doesn't really need to send dust at all in that case, just examine the blockchain. 
Maybe the benefit for the attacker of being a dust transaction, it has a much greater chance of being included in a transaction with another one of your utxos since it is so small.

They're not selling bitcoin. They sell an identity verification service that some Bitcoin exchanges are now using.

You should all come and visit 1770 in Queensland, Australia. More than 30 merchants have agreed to accept crypto for payments, and it's only a small tourist town. (Beautiful by the way) Come and support them - it's happening for real!

Energy efficiency is irrelevant. If a breakthrough makes miners twice as efficient, they will use twice as many.
There is no way to cheat it, and that is why the POW algorithm is ideal.

Nakamoto Satoshi - last name comes first in Japanese.
Still very weird that a guy operating under a pseudonym would role play this Japanese character to such an extent though.... especially at this stage when bitcoin was worth nothing and probably would never be. Either an extremely prescient and paranoid genius or actually a Japanese guy named Satoshi Nakamoto :)

I think you may have wandered into the wrong sub.

Incorrect, funds from a trezor can be stolen with nothing more than physical access to the device, no seed words, no pin.
@_date: 2019-06-24 03:13:36
It was [demonstrated]( at Breaking Bitcoin 2019 that someone with physical access to your trezor can steal your coins with $100 hardware in about 5 minutes.
Trezor has made no official response to this yet - however they have commented on this kind of attack [before]( saying:
"there is a relatively small probability that someone who finds your hardware wallet by chance will have any equipment required to crack into these devices. "
Not exactly confidence inspiring.

I would advise you to stop thinking in analogies. Bitcoin is not like a row of dominoes, or a house of cards, or a firm in an imaginary market, or a Model T Ford.
It's something different. It needs more analysis than these lazy comparisons.

Poor lady still doesn't know what a blockchain is.
Please somebody slap me if I ever start using phrases like 'process capabilities'.

What if you forget your passphrase?
@_date: 2019-01-12 07:46:56
Sounds worse.

Where do you store the password for the encrypted database?
@_date: 2018-11-20 23:07:26
Exactly. Bitcoin is not a good retail payments system. But lightning is! It's designed to be a proper payments system, and this is what those of us interested in payments are building out right now.

That's the first sensible suggestion I've seen.

You're not missing anything, that's literally it. Oh he also drew some arrows.
@_date: 2018-07-05 03:25:53
$1268, $900 - neither of these numbers seem to mean anything. I don't get it.
@_date: 2018-07-21 22:18:14
Did he really just use the photo of those three people unironically?

Any Australian credit card! Living Room of Satoshi lets you pay directly from Lightning mainnet to your credit card. 
@_date: 2018-04-18 02:22:56
This wasn't a credit card transaction, it was depositing money onto my credit card i.e. paying off my credit card balance.
