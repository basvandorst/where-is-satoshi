It doesn't matter what the reason is. Everybody lost Bitcoins (and money in transit). Everybody deserves a full refund. Don't be such an egoist and remove that wallet address.

How long ago was that? I remember doing a euro withdrawal somewhere in June last year and it took quite long indeed. But two withdrawals and deposits in December only took 3 days.

I guess Barclays doesn't give a fuck about [Regulation (EC) 924/2009]( There's no way that a local transfer fee + exchange fee is £15.00. I would ask for a detailed invoice.

By now he's probably having his appointment with a lawyer discussing bankruptcy.
If not, then whatever the problem is, he should be honest about it and put it in an official statement on their website.

My €5000 SEPA deposit on 2014/02/14 is not shown yet.

Nothing is confirmed yet, and I do not feel like I've lost all my bitcoin just yet. But I do feel played, because who knows how long that crisis draft has been around and they pretended nothing was wrong.
@_date: 2014-02-01 16:15:03


Why is everybody on yelling this? Aside from the delays I don't think anything is wrong with Mt.Gox. Then again I'm from Europe so I don't suffer the problems Americans have.
@_date: 2014-02-14 14:48:21
The trading volume of Mt.Gox well above 40k BTC, so yes, they do in fact still "own" any Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-03-08 01:03:54
My bank doesn't even know my phone number or e-mail address.

Yeah withdrawals of 4.5k and deposits of 10k+

That person would need a space shuttle, not an island.
@_date: 2014-02-25 13:26:35
I also had a good feeling, until I read the draft. Then I realised that they have played us this whole time.
@_date: 2014-03-06 14:14:15
*IF* Mt.Gox manages to pay everyone back 100% and get their business straight and secure, then Mt.Gox would be more trustworthy to me than any other exchange out there. If they do not, their name will be pretty much useless.
@_date: 2014-02-25 15:19:29


This is exactly what I was thinking. But then again, why would Mt.Gox be put offline right after this document was leaked? If it's an acquisition, you would leave the exchange online, or at least have an official statement ready before the exchange goes offline. Something really fishy is going on.
@_date: 2014-02-07 07:47:46
How long have you been around? Will be back up in a couple of days.

He's basically telling everyone to forget about it and move on. Well that's how I interpret this.

This may not be something you can answer, but it's been unanswered for the longest time: What happened to the funds on Mt.Gox's Poland bank account that were deposited by users just before the bankruptcy (Feb. 13th and onward) which were never added to the Mt.Gox accounts?
@_date: 2015-08-07 19:39:49
Ah, Call of Duty 1... The true and only Call of Duty. Simple, clean and suitable for competitive play.

I pay a yearly fee for my dutch debit card, and transactions to another person's bank account is not ([yet]( instant. Not to mention SEPA transactions from UK citizens; the fee they pay should be illegal.
@_date: 2015-08-29 13:50:12
I was about to say. There's nothing illegal about helping ISIS with bitcoin in any country AFAIK.

Any moderator, let it be on Reddit, other websites, games or services, should always act from a neutral perspective (sadly this is almost never the case, what's wrong with you humans?!). These moderators are not doing that and thus they are incompetent for the role; it's as simple as that. You guys having to *beg* for letting users vote is sad as fuck. You have to fight for their removal as moderator, or this will always be a subreddit run by people who control what you get to see, which in my eyes may as well count as propaganda.
(edit to elaborate "propaganda"; How many people supporting increased block size or 1mb block size actually know what they are talking about? They just go with whatever they read in the comments)

With companies using publicly known addresses, the link is easily made.
@_date: 2015-07-02 17:39:04
I have multiple cold storage addresses that I'd like to see the accumulated balance of, and possibly alerts on any transactions. I would feel more comfortable if I could check the balance any time I wish without too much hassle.
Edit: I spread out the Bitcoins over multiple addresses for the same reason one wouldn't store all his wealth at one bank.

Why not the 'B' as it is now, but in lower case 'b'? Both will only have to be included in all the fonts out there.. Well, they did it with the Euro sign.

But you'll get a general idea how much goes to the organization behind the charity. This is the biggest reason why I generally don't donate. There have been too many scandals.
@_date: 2015-09-03 16:19:39


Precisely. You all seem to forget that this is about helping them get familiar with Bitcoin, how to set it up, etc. NOT to provide them with Bitcoin, that WOULD be illegal. If sharing public information with ISIS is illegal, you would have to be very careful which strangers you talk to from now on.

If people use it to pay for goods, it is a currency, or am I wrong?
@_date: 2013-12-23 14:08:57


I just don't like how the article is written.


This is exactly why Bitcoin is such a success and all the ~~cryptocurrencies~~ digital currencies before Bitcoin have failed: no central regulator.


This mere refunding 'convenience' costs a lot of money that we, as account holders, pay a lot of money for. How often do we really need a third party to solve our issues? It's like having a car insurance when you don't even have a car.
@_date: 2013-12-06 19:54:45
But then at least keep the orders responsive. Can post new orders but not cancel them.

FYI: Like Bitcoin, being gay also has nothing to do with killing babies. Bitcoin and being gay are both appropriate to discuss on any age.

The dollar sign is also used for multiple currencies. Although Bitcoin is not a Baht, this definitely looks like the best option currently available.
@_date: 2013-12-23 16:06:28
I do all my trading on Mt.Gox mainly because it transfers money to and from my bank account within a few business days. Also Mt.Gox is a Japanese based exchange, and the Japanese value privacy unlike western companies. That might be important if you plan on cheating the wealth tax.
@_date: 2013-11-18 10:22:59
From what I heard, it's at 15:00 EST or 21:00 CET

I managed to convince our customers to receive payments in Bitcoin. They will hold their own wallet. A bot will constantly check for the current value and update the prices accordingly. An acceptable risk factor is that prices may change during a shopper's session.
@_date: 2013-12-25 16:14:06
The title kinda made me sad, that the "common" don't know how to get Bitcoins yet.
@_date: 2013-11-18 09:09:00
This is why you should never exchange with emotion. Panic leads to loss of profitssssss (X3 reference there :D).
@_date: 2013-12-22 15:53:09
Nothing stops you from creating your own party if you live in a democratic country. You could even try to pay for the entire campain with bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-12-06 19:05:16
One order has been up for nearly 10 minutes now.. still nothing. Is there an exchange that's doing this better?
@_date: 2013-12-22 19:25:46
There is no way one can declare Bitcoin illegal in western countries. One can at most not officially recognize it as a currency.
@_date: 2013-12-20 15:37:43
I was thinking of using the small 16x16 bitcoin logo to display in front of the prices on the websites. I could use "0.014 BTC" on the invoices but I would (and the customers as well) rather use a symbol.
@_date: 2013-12-27 15:22:49
Although websites usually get designed on a 960 pixel width grid, there's no way that they are made to fit on those 639 pixels in height that you have remaining there. I haven't seen that many people work in the way that you do -- with separate windows. It is a waste of space since those windows are not borderless. Most people with a single monitor just put their browser on one half of the screen, and anything else they have on the other half. Which means that if you have a full HD 16:9 monitor that you have a height of approximately 980 pixels, depending on your browser (settings) and your taskbar settings. Myself, I have everything on full screen when I work on one monitor, and do some ctrl/win/alt+tab magic which is a much comfortable and quicker way of working. But like you, I'm in a minority group.
That being said all your other points are true and are good suggestions. I would only like to add that OP should add as much as responsiveness to his website as possible. At least one that makes the website fit on half a HD screen.
(I would give you a solution right here but your site's source code is a bit of a mess)
@_date: 2013-12-18 09:17:05
The price may have been going down lately, but the positive news pressure is (and has been) certainly higher than the negative news. I've never seen such a growth in public awareness about bitcoin. Even my mother knows what it is now, and she has never even operated a computer. Therefore I certainly think the price WILL go up eventually, and it is this believe that makes me invest a big share of my savings into bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-12-20 22:06:37
Not sell a single bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-12-18 10:05:34
That's the spirit! I'm doing the same thing since my bank funds needs to stay below 21k euro in order to avoid wealth tax.
@_date: 2013-11-18 20:36:08
They always start with the bad news. Those concerns are real whether they legalise it or not.

Rule  If you think you're going to regret not investing, invest. At most you'll only lose a small percentage of your investment but you won't have regrets.

What about Bitstamp? What's people's experience on that exchange?
@_date: 2013-12-21 21:41:10
I get my money from Mt.Gox every time within 3 business days, small and big amounts..
@_date: 2013-11-18 23:34:56
Not for a few years if all goes well.
@_date: 2013-12-06 19:41:43
Exactly my thoughts. Also exactly why I'm preparing to move exchange now. Mt.Gox isn't cooperating during this system failure though -- cannot withdraw funds!
@_date: 2013-12-20 22:05:09
All I can say is: just do a test transfer. It's what I did and the money was added to my account in 3 days.
@_date: 2013-12-22 19:31:18
I missed it. Can anyone conclude what has been discussed?
