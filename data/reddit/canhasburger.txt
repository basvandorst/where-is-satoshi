Yeah it is, I remember installing the pgp applet myself, so I can just use the fidesmo android app?
This is all assuming I can remember where I put the thing!
@_date: 2016-08-30 21:09:03
Sorry, not arguing with you, just wondering what you mean by "Hackable"? My understanding is that keys get stolen, there hasn't been a bitcoin hack, there have been key thefts.
@_date: 2016-08-30 16:19:57
Great, thanks for the reply. If I find it I'll give it a go :)
@_date: 2016-08-30 14:20:58
I know this is an old post, but I have an old dev Yubikey neo knocking about. Would installing on an old dev neo be the same as with a new one from fidesmo?

I'm UK and some old schoolers still like cheques, especially when it comes to sending funds by mail.
Oh and almost all wedding gifts are cheques.

Ok, taking me a little literally there...
Mainstream media was covering bitcoin way back in 2013 when you could pick up coins for $40 at the low, earlier too. *Most* of the developed world will have heard of it then and *chose* not to buy any, just as many early adopters *chose* to sell at dizzy heights of $10 not that long before.
@_date: 2017-12-05 07:40:42
Just remember, *everyone* had equal opportunity to have a mountain of bitcoin early on and be rich now. It's not like the lottery, it isn't luck of the draw.
I could have been a millionaire right now, if only I had bought 6000 bitcoin.
I have a small fraction of the Bitcoin I have owned, I regret nothing.
@_date: 2017-12-16 08:12:05
Sounds like you're comparing Bitcoin to a company that stopped thinking about its customers and principals, and just wants to keep its investors happy since the original visionary 'departed'... Pretty good analogy actually.
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:29:36
Nope :(
@_date: 2017-12-05 07:43:23
I'm deeply sorry for your loss.

In the UK, when you exchange one asset for another, you owe tax on your capital gains at the point of exchange.
@_date: 2018-08-15 18:52:10
It was in "accounts" which sounds like "on exchanges".
I don't know why a person would need that much currency anywhere other than cold storage...
@_date: 2018-08-15 19:05:18
I'm not. It was a clarification.
@_date: 2017-03-09 06:44:31
Agreed, if Bitcoin were a project I was managing, I would have all the developers with an opinion and main stakeholders sit down and discuss, compromise and reason until there was an agreed long-term roadmap for sustained scalability. Failure to listen to and seriously consider the concerns and ideas of another party would cause you to be kicked off the project and put on first line customer support.
Guys, get a conference facility, get your shit together, or this experiment is fucked.
@_date: 2017-03-11 23:51:37
Good tip, thank you. I will give that a go next time I am buying.
@_date: 2017-03-09 23:46:56
Jesus. It seriously hasn't come down to this sort of bullshit has it?!?
@_date: 2017-03-14 07:28:10
It is substantially worse than that if the majority of users are submitting transactions to the minority hash power.
It will really test the fee market theory at least :)
@_date: 2017-03-14 07:41:40
They won't, the addresses will be the same, the transaction signatures will be the same, the only difference is if your transaction is in a block or not and which chain it got included in. Unless I am missing something.
@_date: 2017-03-09 06:52:38
That's an even quicker way to get reassigned to support.
@_date: 2017-03-14 07:43:59
Furthermore, is it not possible for the same transaction to be validated in both chains, potentially in different block numbers?
@_date: 2017-03-14 07:56:32
With fees the way they they are, wouldn't it be better to lump the buys together at the end of the month? Otherwise you are going to end up with a load of "low value" unspent outputs.
@_date: 2017-03-11 22:02:16
Try being in UK since Circle closed shop. It's SEPA all the way, fees up the wazoo.
@_date: 2016-11-16 15:34:38
Same here
@_date: 2017-08-05 08:44:13
If you regret it, just buy them back next time they drop below 2,850 whatever, which they will.
I also sold some (my BCH 10% bump) at about 2800, made about $1.5k pure profit, could have been more but I could also have picked different lottery numbers last week.
@_date: 2016-12-07 07:31:07
With Circle gone, I don't know of another legit way to buy/sell BTC with a UK debit card :(
@_date: 2017-11-15 23:40:55
I'll take another look but this really is only answering half my question. Segwit+Android+Hardware wallet is the requirement.
@_date: 2017-11-11 13:24:32
You're acting like it's difficult to exchange coins. If things look to be on the turn again, I can sell my new BCH for more BTC than I started with, and it won't take me so damned long to get my BCH onto an exchange!
@_date: 2017-11-11 08:12:20
You guys are so blind.
I sent an $11k trans last night with $4 fee, which as a percentage is cheap, but the transaction was only 224 bytes.
It sat without a single confirmation for 10 hours until bumped the fee by a further $6.
This shit is broken if you want predictable transfer times.
Transaction for non-believers.
@_date: 2017-11-15 22:42:36
Hmmmmmm. I keep hitting new address and none match those from Ledger's wallet.
@_date: 2017-11-11 08:33:30
I knew one of you would ask. Jesus.
Have at it.
It's still at 2 confirmations, 11 hours after submitting.
Haha, proof downvoted.
@_date: 2017-11-15 22:52:52
This is just random :S No joy with GreesAddress or GreenBits.
@_date: 2017-11-11 14:28:36
I believe in making sure I have as many of the "winning" coin as possible.
If BTC can sort out scaling properly, then so be it! It's not a fucking religion.

And the hardware bit?
@_date: 2017-11-15 22:40:43
Desktop version is fine, but I can't find a new wallet from hardware option on Android.
@_date: 2017-11-15 22:07:24
It doesn't show any addresses or transactions, either it doesn't have the correct derivation path or I'm doing something stupid.
@_date: 2019-06-23 08:54:31
And if you mined it then ��‍♂️ ��‍♂️

Dude, brutal!
Good fucking job, you might want to learn about human interaction.
@_date: 2017-11-11 15:26:37
That's fair :P
Whatever is happening, it's pretty exciting times.

Years ago there was a service that would pay you to show you ads above your main browser window, can't remember now what it was called but I made real money with mouse movement macros. Damn, what was it called... There might have been a few.

Yeah, I got rid of all the wheels on my car for the same reason, including the steering one. Who needs that old shit? Just get rid of it! Courage will see us all through.
@_date: 2018-11-20 06:34:21
Well, I guess this really is the long game now :)
(at least for me, I'd never give anyone else financial advice :P)
@_date: 2016-09-13 15:40:22
If they would release it for android I think it would be pretty unstoppable. As Apple only it's not something that will beat WhatsApp or Telegram amongst people I know.
@_date: 2016-09-17 18:34:29
I just tried using it again, first time was months ago, still broken NaN and still won't validate my handle. Meh.
@_date: 2016-09-13 15:52:10
... 'cause, you know, what cars really need is wings.
It's alright though because I've put the wheels in the boot (trunk), so when I need to use those old school road things I can just temporarily put the wheels back on. But fuck, I am totally ready for wings!
@_date: 2016-10-27 06:35:52
Do we have an idea of what the percentage of reasonable non-dust transactions with fee in a 10 minute period can be processed in the next block? Perhaps defining a 'reasonable' transaction needs some work but...
As a Brit who enjoys a good queue, the fee market feels slightly odd. But in a logical sense, isn't it unsustainable if it isn't possible to process a very high percentage of reasonable transactions?
If you take a scenario where only x% of reasonable transactions, those with the highest fee first, are processed, and extrapolate that over time, you end up with an increasing fee that the rich will (might if it's still a service that has value) pay, and an ever growing mass of normal people standing about in limbo with transactions that will never be processed.
What is the foreseen future without increasing block size? Fewer plebs using the system because they know that they will just end up in the growing pleblog?
I had a transaction from shapeshift.io with 50 sat/byte fee take 8 hours to get into a block yesterday, I don't have control over that fee.
Currently 8 hours makes for an unusable system. I'm not going to buy my burger with bitcoin if I have to wait 8 hours for a confirmation before I can eat... 
@_date: 2016-10-27 08:19:23


So when did this become the accepted way things are? That's what I want Bitcoin to be, and I understood that to be the original intention. Is this no-longer a goal?
Also, I kinda see what r/btc are going on about because I feel there are two pretty sensible questions in my post and I just get downvoted. To reiterate:
1) What percentage of the current level of 'reasonable' transactions can we process
2) What's the plan to deal with the rest of the reasonable transactions?
I have a further reasonable question:
SegWit gives a boost, I can see that. How does it provide further boost moving forward?
