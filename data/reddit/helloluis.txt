Thanks for giving us a try! We've actually already got your first suggestion, which you can access once you've logged in. You can copy the details from a previous transaction so you only need to define the amount if you're always sending to the same person. 
Regarding your second suggestion,  we're working on making the status page more real time and should have an improved version out by the weekend. Thanks again!

We were maybe thinking too far ahead with the address and personal info, but one of our goals was to have daily contests that don't just give out BTC, but also physical items provided by sponsors. (In my finest daydreams, we get to give away Polaroids or GoPros.)
At the moment we're narrowing the field down to just selfies coz it's easier to pitch that concept to people, but I have a feeling that the community is going to do whatever the hell it wants if we run this thing long enough. :)

Just to provide a little more detail into how the system currently works, we removed the Bitcoin wallet requirement very recently (like, within the past 48 hours), and now allow users to receive tips and win the daily prizes without them. As soon as they provide a wallet address and hit the minimum withdrawal threshold, we forward the money over to them.
@_date: 2014-06-23 21:43:35
We're approaching the problem in stages. There's a daily contest that awards a small amount of BTC to the person whose photo received the most number of likes for that 24-hour period. We've awarded a couple hundred mBTC over the past two weeks. 
And obviously, anyone who already has BTC can tip anyone on the site, thereby bringing more currency into the system.
@_date: 2014-07-30 05:00:57
We've got a QR code scanner on the prepaidbitcoin.ph site, but currently it expects to see your receiving wallet address. The foil-covered QR code is an interesting idea, although I suspect that we would need to switch to a different supplier for that kind of card. :)
@_date: 2014-11-26 00:19:54
I've written about this subject pretty extensively so I'm going to go ahead and "bother complaining" about your data and example figures, as they're really far from what the average remittance back to the Philippines is like. The two largest overseas Filipino populations are in the US and Saudi Arabia (not Canada and Malaysia), but the US population leans more towards immigrants (who have chosen to move there with their families in tow) while the SA population is largely composed of migrant or contract workers (who are simply working there for a set period of time and remitting money back to their families every payday, as you described).
The reason why this is relevant is because the contract workers in the Middle East, Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore, etc don't make anywhere near the amount of money that you're using in your examples. Indeed, the average remittance is somewhere between $200-300 per month, and that's it.
Even the World Bank's remittance price comparison site ( doesn't bother comparing fees for amounts over $500, because they know that it's too rare to be relevant.
So what you should really be doing is comparing what traditional remitters like Hyperremit or Remitly or Xoom charge for a **$200 remittance**, because that's the price range at which their flat fees gouge the market the most. The traditional remitters know that that's the sweet spot, so they've optimized their pricing with flat fees of $4-6 to make the most of the high traffic in that range.
Some links to help reframe your challenge a bit more (the first one is mine):
@_date: 2014-07-25 15:22:25
Thanks for the clarification. I live in the Philippines and obviously don't have access to a US bank account, but am still able to use Coinbase as my primary wallet. (That, and blockchain.info's.)
I noticed that there was a talk at Coin Congress about discouraging operators from storing their customers' coins though, and I'm aware that that really isn't the most secure way to go about things. We're currently architecting our own local wallet implementation and will probably build it with that firmly in mind.

Thanks for pointing that out! We originally wrote that page back before Apple allowed Bitcoin wallets back into the app store.
@_date: 2014-07-15 09:59:57
Hello! Thanks so much for giving the service a try and spending time writing this review. The issue that you described was due to a timing problem - -  although the BTC had left your wallet already, our app didn't receive  its required 1 confirmation until after the 15 mins had lapsed. 
We're building a zero confirm solution to replace what we're currently using, so ideally this situation won't happen again for smaller amounts of transfers. In the interim what we will probably do is increase the refresh rate to 30 mins, which will allow ample time for confirmation to occur. 
We can also offer to return the extra BTC you had to pay, if you'd like. Or credit it to a subsequent transfer if you decide to use our service again. Please just let us know. 
@_date: 2014-06-23 20:06:49
Sounds like a cool idea. I'll do the math and see if we can swing this.

We’re saving up for the translation services in several languages. For now, we only have the English version available.
@_date: 2019-08-22 11:31:57
There's a lot of work that goes into making a book **concise** and yet still have all of the fundamentals clearly explained. My co-authors and I wrote over 35,000 words in total but we pared it down to just over 22,000 in an effort to make the book tighter and easier to read. It is much more difficult to write short than long, and takes a lot of skill to get to the point where every word and sentence has been properly considered.   
Obviously we don't agree that the current price point is too expensive for such a book, but I imagine we'll know soon enough which one of us was correct there.

I love Saifedean, and hes always been very generous with his advice to us individually. I think that his book and ours would make a great double feature, because ours is broader in scope but also less detailed, by design. Think of ours as the book you read casually on a single transcontinental flight, while The Bitcoin Standard is what you would read over several days or even weeks at home on your couch.

@_date: 2019-08-22 09:56:53
The book is primarily intended for pre-coiners who have no familiarity with Bitcoin, so given our resource constraints we decided it was wiser to offer the book through the most mainstream sales channel possible first. This allows us to get feedback from average readers quickly. Obviously we want to sell this book for BTC at some stage, and the plan is to use the early profits from Amazon to start expanding in several directions — language translation, new sales channels (of which Bitcoin purchasing is one), maybe even an audiobook.
@_date: 2019-08-22 04:58:12
Amazon's top 10 bestselling books list is purely a sales figure, and not related to the reviews. The book's only been out 48 hours so most people who have bought havent even had time to read it yet ;)

@_date: 2019-09-03 23:15:29
I think we hope for that eventually, but my personal view is that it will supplant gold as a global reserve currency. In this manner, you would still have local currencies but also be able to accept Bitcoin everywhere. Countries like Cambodia already do this with the USD: they price everything in both dollars and riel, with a slight preference for the dollar because I guess it's more stable.
@_date: 2017-10-09 16:51:25
Thank you sir :-)
@_date: 2019-09-03 23:00:19
I think personally my reasons for being in Bitcoin are purely practical: fiat is crap, and fiat in developing nations even more so. I needed a reasonable exit from my local currency, and Bitcoin was what made the most sense.

Just a bit over 110 pages, most people (a few of them were Bitcoiners already familiar with some fundamental concepts) have said they were able to read it in a single sitting, and that's exactly what we were aiming for.
@_date: 2019-09-03 16:06:03
During our planning day, a few of the authors identified folks like our parents or our non-technical friends as the primary readers of the book we wanted to write. They may not care precisely what the Byzantine Generals solution is, but they do need to get a sense of why Bitcoin is worth learning more about.
And yes, "Why Bitcoin?" was one of our early choices for a title, so this focuses on the reasons for Bitcoin, and not so much about how it works internally.
@_date: 2019-09-03 15:29:17
The plan is to use the revenues from the English edition to finance the translations and distribution in other regions.

I think an accurate representation of wealth distribution in Bitcoin is probably only going to be possible through some massive forensic effort, and I'm not sure who would pay for that kind of analysis. 
When people ask me this at our Bitcoin workshops, I usually counter by saying we know that **in the fiat world 0.6% of the world's population currently controls 40% of its wealth.** Bitcoin represents an opportunity to redistribute some of that wealth, and that's why I'm here in this workshop trying to teach as many people as possible about it.

The goal with the cover art was to use the familiar (leather, fabric, paper) to introduce the unfamiliar (Bitcoin). Its a skeuomorphic style that Apple used to use in its early iOS / macOS apps and works well for making things fell more tangible and physical.
@_date: 2019-09-04 04:19:14
I think there are enough great bitcoin companies all working on solutions from a variety of angles, and eventually there will be enough payment products that smooth things out such that it will be indistinguishable from any other digital payment. But that alone isnt enough -- most people still dont know this stuff even exists, so the challenge remains an education-based one even now. We're hoping that this book and its future editions will become the entry point for lots of average people, and prepare them for the apps and platforms that are currently being built.

Hi all, I'm one of the co-founders at Rebit.ph and just wanted to weigh in on some of the comments here. This post is actually quite old, from way back when our service had only been around for a month. It specifically talks about a couple of issues with our workflow back then (e.g., the 15-minute timer, the 1% fee) that were resolved last year. 
The price is locked in upon submission of the remittance form, and the user has 60 minutes to send BTC to the dynamically generated invoice address. After 60 minutes have passed without an announced transaction, the remittance page will refresh with a new rate.
Also, we removed the 1% fee completely and now offer the service for free (although third-party fees still apply), as mentioned by another NLNico in his own comments.
