Considering I'm studying jellyfish breeding at the moment, this is not untrue; however, your argument is missing one point: Those who don't pay taxes and can't vote should of course not be affected by those politics. You refer to a system where the taxpayers can decide over the fate of the non-payers, however, the libertarian approach would be that you are not even forced into any government system in the first place. All the problems you probably see in the 'voluntary taxes' approach are just because the government uses force. Unless I misunderstood your argument?
EDIT: Refering to your original post: A libertarian can always like paying taxes because he enjoys the security the state offers, or the legal system, or whatever. But it's not libertarian to say all others have to pay as well because they would profit from it as well. If someone isn't willing to pay for a service voluntarily, the logical conclusion is that to him, that service is not worth the price.

A new currency de jure 'copies' the blockchain, so it just happens to give the current key-owners some. There is no "right" to the new coins just because you owned old ones. If I issued a new currency and said everyone who currently holds US dollar now gets an equal amount of Whatever-dollar, debitors would not suddenly owe their creditors my new currency.
When I give my money to an exchange, they owe me only that money. Just because someone gives them a new currency based on what they hold doesn't magically create new obligations towards me.

The lack of specialized hardware could be a bad thing. As long as most of your mining power is provided by hardware that is *specifically* created for that algorithm and has no other uses, miners have an incentive to keep the network alive; plus we can be pretty sure that there are no large unused capacities out there. But when all general purpose machines could easily mine, it means that someone can fuck over the network and then still use their expensive equipment for other purposes (or sell it); and it means that the total mining power could fluctuate immensely.

The fact that gold can be used for electronics is completely irrelevant. Gold has its value because it's a useful value storage.
Use for industry isn't more "intrinsic". It only exists because those electronics have value, and they only have value because people want them.
Value simply isn't a physical property. Everything can have value when people want more than there is, anything can lose value when people don't want it anymore.

It doesn't need to be a currency, it can simply be a store of value. Easier to move and trade than gold and harder to steal. I'll happily do all my day to day transactions in fiat and store my wealth in crypto. Might not be the original purpose, but it works extremely well rn.

Could you quickly elaborate to a noob why that is? Once the address is known, what additional information could an attacker gain when it's used again?
@_date: 2017-05-15 19:06:22
So reuse would basically just mean the attacker has two different hashes of the same public key, making it easier to find that public key?
@_date: 2017-05-27 23:17:24
That difference is not structural though, only a matter of quantity. ETFs are still correlated (economic cycle), just less so, and neither is fully correlated. The basic point of the comparison isn't compromised by this.

@_date: 2017-05-27 20:23:50
Of course it's not the same, that's the point of a comparison. The one has a diversification of assets to reduce risk, the one has an averaging of acquisition price to reduce risk. It's really not hard to see the logical similarity of the concepts.
(In case you don't understand: Imagine the difference between acquisition price and selling / 'real' price as your profit. Buy only once, you get that profit, buy at multiple acquisition prices, you have multiple different 'profits'. For stocks, the point is "different stocks will have different value performances"; for averaging it means "different batches of coins will have different prices", aka different price differences between acquisition and whatever value you want to assign them.)
Or even more simple: ETFs average the *return value* between several stocks for a fixed investment, DCA averages the *investment* between several purchase times for a fixed return value (since all BTCs will be worth the same).

@_date: 2017-05-27 21:20:52
I'm talking about logical equivalence here - the underlying concept is "picking a random value several times and averaging it reduces variance." With ETFs, that value is random because you can't know the performance. With DCA, the value is "random" because you don't know at what point of the distribution it is (you don't know the average price ahead of time). Obviously this works for both DCA and any other investment plan where you buy several times, but that's irrelevant since the concept OP was not understanding was how multiple purchases decrease risk. The added benefit of keeping the dollar cost the same doesn't matter if that's your objection here. The comparison *does* of course refer to DCA as opposed to lump sum.

Mate you're getting way too worked up here that you're now trying to analyze random words to somehow prove to me that I meant it this and that way. It was an explanation of a theoretical concept, if you misunderstood that, you are hereby corrected, end of story. This is not a discussion of how valuable DCA really is in this case, there are enough of those.
@_date: 2017-05-27 12:46:08
Risk is something different than expected profit. Arbitrage = low risk, high profit; fixed deposit = low risk, low profit; stocks = high risk, high profit; gambling = high risk, low profit.
Dollar cost averaging doesn't increase the expected value, it decreases the probability of having a very high *or* very low overall price. You are not "gambling that an average price over a period of time will be a cheaper buy than the current price", you are simply making sure you get a more averaged price that is neither especially low nor especially high.
It's like switching from stocks to ETFs - there is no reason why 200 stocks together should perform better than one of them alone, so you're not increasing your expected profit; but it's less likely that *all of them* will perform bad.

But how big it is is irrelevant. I was giving an example to OP to show how averaging reduces risk. That effect exists, whether it's significantly bigger in the comparison is moot. In fact I'd argue examples *should* be more extreme to really show a concept. OP asked why the concept itself has any advantage, whether it is actually worth it for BTC is a different subject.

Noob question here, wouldn't it be possible for them to simply allow a "construct transaction" function? Like, I get to say "Publish a transaction that transfers all my BCC funds to this address", and Electrum just does no validating at all, but simply writes the transaction for me and publishes it. I can manually check on the explorer whether it worked, and I don't need to give my private keys to any other software.

So am I understanding this correctly that there's the actual possibility of a hard fork that would actually go on forever? Meaning there are just two currencies, and we'll need a new name for the forked one? And I need a wallet for both since, at the time of the fork, I own BTC so I will now own both currencies? Or do we expect one of the forks to convince more and more nodes so that the other one eventually becomes worthless?
