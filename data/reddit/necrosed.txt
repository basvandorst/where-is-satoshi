So you don't even understand the basic bitcoin properties, I see.

nice one, government, you won't get me with this one

Short answer: yes, since there's a limited amount of bitcoin in the world, just like gold.

You can fraction it, but you're not generating any new bitcoin with that. Inflation is closely related to creation of more currency without generating its equivalent value. Essentially it is diluting the total value of the currency by spreading its value in new notes.
You can't create new Bitcoin once it has been totally mined out. You can generate new bitcoin for now, but it is mathematically arranged in a way that you can only generate in a rate that is scalable with the usage of the coin - so if there's a drop in usage of the coin it instantly gets more valuable as the rate of mining will diminish and in return it will get more scarce and valuable.
Fiat doesn't have these sorts of mechanisms, and geta constantly devalued so the state can essentially tax you without passing a bill for it - by devaluing your money. That's the true nature of inflation - a hidden tax.

Always buy, never sell. Shit's digital gold, it only appreciates with time and more than any other kind of asset.
I'm not doing this to get rich, I'm doing it to get retired.

Makes sense. It's common to sell part of your assets to achieve liquidity or break even.
