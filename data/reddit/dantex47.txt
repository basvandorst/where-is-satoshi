I have a question about LN. This is what I know:
* Opening LN channel requires on-chain entry
* Closing the LN channel requires on-chain entry
* To get BTC to actually land on my account, I need to close the channel
If I understood correctly:
So if I want to send 10$ in BTC to my friend, and neither of us has any open LN channels, I need to open a channel on chain, pay the fee, wait 10+ minutes so that channel is processed on-chain, sent 10$ with almost no fees, and then close the channel, paying fees and waiting for 10+ minutes until channel is closed?

I have tried Bitfinex, Biannce, Bittrex, and few others. I have had the best experiences with coinbase/GDAX. All others have high deposit fees ~10 euros to 30 euros, depending on the currency, withdrawal fees are about the same, Bitfinex has minimum buy order of about 50  euros depending on the coin, Both Bitfinex and Binance have 200 to 500 euro minimum withdrawal fee. So for a person going in with about 500 euros it makes no sense to go anywhere but coinbase/gdax. Not to mention extreme veryfication times (over 2 months on Bitfinex, 2 weeks on Bittrex), while Coinbase/ gdax took 5 minutes.

No body would like to see bitcoin succeed more than me.
I am all for more segwit but it kind odd suck that segwit depends on community. I was for the middle ground - 2MB blocks ASAP, and segwit when it comes. By some rough estimates we wouldnt have these problems today if block size was 2MB, not only that but that compromise could have stoped BCH hard fork

Or... use something else? Litecoin/Ethereum/BCH...
It doesn't have to be low fees **OR**  fast transaction times, if you use something that actually works as a currency
@_date: 2018-01-07 01:00:42
Ethereum has a soft limit on block sizes. So when the consensus of miners thinks that there are too many transactions piling up, they rise gas limit. No hard fork needed. That brought fees down and capacity up. Ethereum is now processing 1.25M transactions per day, at TX fee of about $3 MAX.

I hate when people laugh at the two pizza story, calling people dumb because they didn't hodl. Do you understand that Bitcoin wouldn't be worth 15k today if that transaction didn't happen? It is a historical transaction, where for the first time someone in the real world accepted that bitcoin was worth anything.
And same holds again for the future, if everybody uses bitcoin "as a store of value", by definition, people will move to something else to actually pay for things.

Nobody uses Bitcoin for criminal activity. Monero is most used for that. Monero hides the IP address, who sent money, who received it and how much.
@_date: 2018-01-12 16:22:40
And ROI depends on functionality. I don't think that people will care if the bitcoin was the first crypto. MySpace held for a long time, and then something just better came. There wasn't much wrong with MySpace, but they didn't keep up with the trends.
@_date: 2017-12-28 02:32:07
And where do you draw the line then? When it will be "enough"?
As people said, even if this guy held, where should he have stopped? at 10k? 50k? 100k? 1M? 10M?
Never cashing makes way less sense than cashing out at a 5X profit.
@_date: 2017-12-24 14:42:47
And [3 mining pools holding over 50% of the hashing power]( isn't centralized?
And what about Litecoin? You only said that BCH is bad. Litecoin has faster transactions, lower fees and its less centralized than bitcoin because it's uses memory-hard hashing algorithm. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 02:45:17
Probably not lucky, just having more money than they need.
If I invested let's say $100 dollars at the moment that guy did, that isn't that much. But at the point that $100 becomes $100,000 and bills start rolling in, maybe some medical bills, or an accident...
It is nice to so much money to never even have to look at $100k just sitting there.

Printing money is essentialy stealing from all people who own dollars.
If there were only 100 dollars in the world, and US bank needed the money, and printed another 100, the value of the dollar would be halved.
I would have 50 equivalent dollars, and government would have 50 equivalent dollars.
That is the whole reason why it was planned to have limited number of Bitcoins. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 14:36:01
Such a stupid example. We are talking about but sending money to another person, in another country maybe. Currently it's cheaper and almost faster to send money using WesternUnion, who has fee of $10 to send money internationally. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 11:15:37
For many people $10k is a significant amount
@_date: 2017-12-24 14:46:30
I am not familiar with that, can you post some links? What I know from media is that bitcoin Cash wanted bigger blocks, but core team was against any increase because it would lead to centralization 
@_date: 2017-12-24 14:49:20
How is LTC centralized? Is it less centralized than current state of Bitcoin where 3 mining pools from China controll over 50% of hashing power?
LTC at least uses Scrypt hashing algorithm that is ASIC resistant. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 16:13:35
It does, in some extent.
If US government needs to pay of debt of say, 100 million euros they will have to print more money of due the inflation dollar is worth less. But they will print how ever much they need.

This is such a stupid reaction. Mocking people for making a 5X return on investment... That is better than any stock out there.
Same as mocking the 10 000 BTC pizza. Do people not realize that before that transaction, Bitcoin was worth $0?
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:46:15
when the coin is dropping, everybody rushes to sell.
Coinbase reported that they had 8 times more traffic than biggest previous rush.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:47:42
They reported 8 times bigger activity today  than the biggest previous spike.
@_date: 2017-11-27 06:14:49
This is stupid. Only reason bitcoin *is* worth that much is because there are people *buying* at that price. Their purchases are making your coins more valuable.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:37:15
I really don't know. The bitcoin is currently dipping ($9350) at the time of the writing, probably selling craze.
Worst ever was 13th of november there were 158 000 transactions
@_date: 2017-11-29 09:31:47
The explanation provided in the link claims that problem is divisibility, but that is not the case.
Problem is the rate of growth. I could have paid $10 in bitcoin for a pizza last week, but if I held (which is the mantra of this sub, never spend, just hold) I would have 13 dollars in a bitcoin. Instead of buying pizza a month ago, I held I would have 17.5 dollars. Almost double. 
Such a high short-term rate growth is a problem. Even in the shorter term, if I didn't buy a $100 of stuff yesterday, I would have $108.

bitcoin processes transactions in a block. Block can handle 4000 transactions. Block is calculated every 10 minutes. Currently there are 90 000 transactions waiting.
@_date: 2017-11-29 09:39:15
There are bitcoins exchanges. (GDAX, Bitfinex, and similar).
ELI5: it's a market where people meet, where some people want to buy bitcoin for dollars, and some want to sell bitcoin for dollars. If you come with enormous amount of money, like 100 million USD bitcoin, you would create big supply that would drop the price.
And currently, those are BIG markets. For example in last 24 hours, Bitfinex exchanged $857,677,000 of bitcoin

I was referring to OP mocking people buying bitcoin at 9,700$ - it is stupid to mock people giving your bitcoin actual value

Bitcoin is backbone of crypto world. It has largest market cap. When bitcoin goes down everything goes down.

Evey cryptocurrency in their protocol defines the problem. Bitcoin is proof-of-work protocol that uses SHA256 algorithm. There are other alternatives, like Equihash or completely new model proof-of-stake.
Miners get bitcoins for solving the problems. If you are asking is there some useful work being done by those calculations, the answer is no. There is no useful result. It is just a very hard problem that can be used to prove that you did the work. 
This video explains really well how solving difficult problems gives legitimacy to the transactions:

You can see how much of which crypto is exchanged in last 24h [here]( and you can see how big is the market for each crypto [here](
Size of bitcoin market, at the moment of speaking is $182,237,286,309

Coinbase is one of a few places that allows the buy with credit card. My counties banks are tearing me a new one by having a wire transfer fee of 12 dollars minimum when sending and 10 dollars when getting the money.
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:27:44
bitcoin protocol can handle up to  4000 transactions every 10 minutes, there are currently 91k transactions waiting
