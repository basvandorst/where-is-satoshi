OP has been scammed and is refusing to accept this fact. It has nothing to do with binance. He has posted multiple posts saying he has done skype video chats with "binance support" and refuses to post email headers confirming it was actually binance who told him to talk to them through skype.
Binance doesnt do skype support. He has been giving all his personal information, including his face on webcam, to scammers, and now he's blaming binance.
It is very unfortunate this happened to OP, but repeatedly trying to shame binance for something they are not at fault for will accomplish nothing.
Edit: **Ever since OP had that skype call two weeks ago there has most likely been multiple different people with every last bit of his personal information trying to get binance to unfreeze that account.** He should be doing whatever the fuck he can to keep that account frozen instead he has posted 6 posts on 3 different subreddits saying binance stole his money. If his account has been kept frozen for this time he should be thanking binance profously yet here is doing all he can to give binance bad publicity instead of listening to all the people telling him what he did wrong so that he might help binance move forward with this.
OP you needed to start doing damage control 2 weeks ago. You need to create a new email. The scammers not only have all your personal information you gave them, they know what email adress you use. You also should never again use or create an exchange account linked to any of those documents you sent them. **If youre using any other exchanges get your money out of there now.**

I just accepted an order for 1 BTC and we've begun the trade process. Currently waiting for him to confirm payment. What keeps him from saying the money never came and to keep both that and the bitcoin?

Is there a way to tie my buy order to the market price? Having a buy order on a set price is fine as long as it doesn't take too long for someone to take it. However when having one up for longer periods of time it can deviate a bit since the market price is quite fluid. 
Otherwise i'm gonna have to redo the order every once in a while if the price alters too much... :)
Edit: aaand thats exactly what people are doing. I now saw you can choose a percentage of the market price instead of a fixed one.

Alright thanks for the info. Will people who has not accepted Sweden still see my offer though? So that they can maybe add Sweden and then accept it. Or has it been filtered from them.

Recently switched to Bitsquare and so far it's amazing. The only problem i've had so far though is pretty much no one seems to be accepting trades from Sweden. Ive added a SEPA account since all EURO trades seem to use that and at the time of writing there are 8 euro offers up but Sweden doesn't seem to be on anyones accept list. All of them, more or less, accept from all countries (that you can choose when creating a SEPA) except sweden. Any help in understanding why?
 This is what most of them looks like. The only one ive seen with sweden on that list was 4% over market and none other since. bitsquare gets pretty much obsolete for me if no one accepts my country for trades... help?

Ok, so we can create order, pick order, and accept order party to party for as long as we'd like as long as it doesn't take longer than 8 days? (i would never plan for it to take that long though)
@_date: 2017-02-25 20:47:04
Aah yes i noticed that right after i wrote the comment :D Is it fine if i choose 0.00% deviation from market price? or will people only pick up my order if they profit slightly from the transaction?
I think tying it to the market price with no unnecessary fees seems the most fair for both parties.  
@_date: 2017-02-24 21:42:30
I set euro when setting up SEPA men Sweden isn't on anyone's accept list. 
If someone picks up my order how long do I have to accept it? Can I leave it running over the day or are we talking about much lower windows?
@_date: 2017-02-24 21:24:09
I downloaded it today yet no one seems to be accepting trades from Sweden. Any reason why?

2013 was 6 years ago though.

Coinbase sent emails to everyone notifying them that they would not currently support the bch split and that you should withdraw your funds if you wanted both coins. They never said they would give out bch to btc holders.
Always keep control of your own keys if possible.

Planning on buying some more bitcoins next time it dips, so i thought I'd ask here when is your best guess that would happen? We've been going strong now since the dip to $930. I could see us keeping this momentum for a while still, especially with segwit and lightning on the horizon.
And yes i know the answer to this would be wildly hypothetical. :)

I've used bitsquare for a while and ive had no issues with it what so ever, it's a really great platform. At first I was worried about the security of it however it is quite safe.
Anyone can post/accept trades (max 1 BTC per trade with using SEPA, not sure about the others). Most orders are set at a fixed % of the market price mostly ranging from 0-5% depending on who issues it. When an order is accepted it first needs at least one confirmation (I think 6+ is considered very safe) before a trade can begin. Both parties pay a security deposit which for the BTC seller includes the amount of btc being sold. Once there is enough confirmations the buyer transfers the money and chooses "payment started". Once the seller receives said payment he confirms it and the trade is completed. 
If there is any issues with the trade, or if it exceeds the max trade duration (~~7~~ 8 days for SEPA) any of the two parties can call upon an arbitrator, of who which attempt to solve any issues. I've only had this happen once and that was very quickly resolved.
After a completed trade you simply transfer your bitcoins (if bought) from your bitsquare wallet to your external one of choice and all is well :)

IIRC there is a 0.0018 btc trading fee when you create or accept an order, and a 0.0015 mining fee. (last time i checked) The fees are clearly stated when you fund the trade :)

As far as I know the highest it has BTC has been is 2980ish which was a few days ago. However it can wary slightly depending on what exchange the price is based on. It's been hovering around 2600-2900 for the past week or so, most likely due to uncertainties regarding august 1 and rising ethereum demand.
I mostly use coinmarketcap for price checks and poloniex for more advanced charts/graphs.
@_date: 2017-06-03 15:35:07
All you need is an external wallet to fund your trades, nothing more.

A safe buried in the ground is still safer than one on your shelf ;)
Edit: If you want to hide something don't tell people where to look.
