From his perspective it's a good way to make a reentry into the exchange game, which is still pretty new if you think about it.

Wish I understood the downvotes. I sort of broke the Karpeles angle. Don't think many ppl knew that before.

Exactly the opposite if you read the article.

I mean they have a point. Bitcoin is highly addictive.

When he abandoned the Satoshi identity it was possible to get into Bitcoin thru mining or other means without a huge capital investment. It's likely he did that. He handed a certain important key to Theymos and started mining and participating as another identity or even as himself. Maybe he traveled for a few years or raised a family while Frankenstein grew up. He's either right in front of our face or he was Hal Finney or Dave Kleiman. Maybe he was Wei Dai. Maybe he is someone still working on crypto. Chances are high he destroyed the original keys. In later communities those coins would be called a ninja mine.

Well, with only 1 input, it'd just be a small donation to the miners. You can do the same thing by specifying said address as your change address. I mean, most Bitcoin transactions send some coin to an outside address and the majority back to the same wallet. Usually a random change address is chosen by the client, but I'm quite sure you can specify if you create your own transaction. Point is, in Bitcoin "sending money to yourself" is actually one of the standard operations.

Cypherpunks write code. Activists do activist shit and get a lot of wanted and unwanted attention. He's a martyr now but at the time a lot of folks felt WL would be more successful if operated like Anonymous or, you know, that other thing. He became a rockstar and loved every second of it. Numerous innocent Afghani informers we're put at risk because of him and Chelsea Manning. Just people who picked the winning side and tattled on some petty tyrants. No one thinks of them when they talk about all this. The disclosures weren't done responsibly. People likely died. Satoshi was the opposite personality of Assange. He would be more like Craig Wright or Mike Hearn if he were active in this community: a diva coasting on rusty laurels.

Oh, there were definitely flaws. There was an inflation bug in Satoshis day.

Roger Ver cares about Bitcoin. He sincerely believes in on chain scaling and is clearly not alone. Craig Wright will likely implode again once he's done fighting non BSV people. He's just a crazy old cunt.

People on this side did the inverse. If you didn't notice he strictly refers to it as Bitcoin Cash. He will elucidate that he feels it's closer to the original he went deep in back when, but he concedes that BTC is the longest chain with the most proof of work and seems happy to build in that community. He wasn't wrong about the restriction of open debate here and that is what most set him ablaze. Craig Wright says doubly ridiculous things. He talks about patents and Bitcoin not being the antithesis of banks. He says he can deanomynize (sic mobile) Monero. If Ver is a troll Wright is like an immortal troll with Trump DNA thrown in. Really if you look at both and then contrast with some Bitcoin maximalists and then some no coiners, objectively they are all shitheads, but Wright comes off as most I'll intentioned, self important, and full of shit.

Was, maybe, in a way, but now it's an independent chain, with independent miners, and even a different addressing format. Either I need a Kool Aid refill or I just fail to see how a group going their own way is an "attack." The fork was the best possible outcome; certainly in a polemic sense it's better this way than it was with the constant in-fighting seen in the days of Mike Hearn and later.

It is interesting that Nick Szabo wasn't cited. Perhaps the author didn't want to cite himself.

Has anyone listened to that ridiculous 911 phone call? One hopes this person is billed for the time spent by EMS as well as Mr. Lopp's relocation costs. (In addition to whatever statutes are already being brought against them when they're found.)

And is there any point in ever selling Bitcoin? I really don't know.

This is correct.
@_date: 2017-10-15 20:35:47
You are exactly right. A legitimate fork will take steps to not confuse itself with the "legacy" chain. Bitcoin Cash is a fork. This is an attack.
