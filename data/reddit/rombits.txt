I like the sentiment, but I think it’s safer to deem settling a contract involving an on chain tx. In that sense you’re looking at around 200 sat for one.

It also doesn’t help with the hard fork part of a block size increase.

Only when those fees represent a fair bid by a user and not a misguided estimation by a flawed algorithm. Seems like at this point the majority are due to flawed algorithms.

This got me thinking about the math of attacking the UTXO set and trying to bloat it out of control. So down the rabbit hole I went...
56m UTXOS account for approx 2.6gb on disk. 
That’s ~21,538 UTXOs per mb. 
Constructing a basic transaction involves 180bytes plus 10bytes plus 34bytes per output. 
If we assume to hold 1 BTC in one address available for ‘melting’ as Pieter put it, we could melt this down into a theoretical 1,470,582 UTXOs assuming a fee of 1sat/byte. 
180 + 34*1,470,582 + 10 = 49,999,978 bytes. 
Therefore at a cost of ~ 1 BTC you can add approx 68mb of UTXOs. 
EDIT: Appears there’s a fatal flaw in this math. This places the transaction at 50mb and not possible to include in any block. 
For a max 1mb tx we can have 29,406 UTXOs assuming nothing else is mined in that block which maxes this out to just over 1mb of UTXO disk size growth per 10min block interval.

Different angle. The hardfork allowed for bigger blocks. The risk is bigger blocks force full nodes off the network. It becomes more expensive to run one, and unless you are earning money for it or have a specific reliance on one there’s less incentive for you to do so. Refer to my other reply just above to see why full nodes are important. 
There’s developers like Luke who argue every single bitcoin user should rely on their own bitcoin full node. That’s why he wants block size to be reduced, so the above can’t happen. How practical this is is everyone’s own interpretation. You might be ok making certain compromises, where others won’t. 
Sorry back to your point - less full nodes due to increased block size leads to more power in the hands of miners. Simultaneously pushing for bigger reliance on SPV goes against the core of what many people see BTC being. The power dynamic shifts back towards miners as no one else is keeping them in check. Don’t trust, verify ;)

Has anyone actually taken the time to read the comments made by the SEC about this rejection?
"Although the Commission is disapproving this proposed rule change, the Commission emphasizes that its disapproval does not rest on an evaluation of whether bitcoin, or blockchain technology more generally, has utility or value as an innovation or an investment. Rather, the Commission is disapproving this proposed rule change because, as discussed in detail below, BZX has not met its burden under the Exchange Act and the Commission's Rules of Practice to demonstrate that its proposal is consistent with the requirements of the Exchange Act Section 6(b)(5), in particular the requirement that its rules be designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices."
If a proposal comes across their desk which DOES satisfy these, then there is no reason for them to withhold approval. A more established name, like CBOE, is likely to dot their i’s and cross their t’s having had more experience with this sort of process. 
A great read on why this is likely to be delayed still can be found here:
Basically March 4th 2019 is the final and firm date for an ETF to be approved for CBOE.

Few months late to the party.

Yes, you gain nothing in terms of actual rewards such as BTC. 
But no, you are helping secure the network as a whole. Without independent full nodes, miners may collude and feed invalid blocks to everyone that is relying on SPV to run their wallets. That’s a loaded sentence and will make you deep dive on some more information, but essentially even though you are not producing blocks, you are validating them. 
Think of it as an extension of hash power being distributed. We rely on that to combat subtle, non rule breaking means of control over BTC, the most basic one being censorship. You don’t have to try and put invalid transactions in a block to be a bad guy. You can just ignore specific ones and become a small overlord. 
For those same reasons, we rely on a healthy number of nodes to keep miners from colluding and being the only ones validating blocks. This again links back to SPV. 
Distributed hash power keeps miners from censoring and rule breaking. 
Distributed nodes keep miners from fooling SPV wallets.

Miners generate Proof of Work. 
Nodes generate valid blocks of transactions, verify and propagate them throughout the network, and establish connections with other nodes. 
Basically everything you know about Bitcoin is done by nodes. The only thing they do not do is attempt to generate a proof of work. 
Miners cannot mine without also running a node which generates valid blocks for them. 
Every miner is also a node but not every node is a miner.
