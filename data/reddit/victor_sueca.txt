The expected generation output, at 100000.0 Mhps, given difficulty of 1.66851513283e+11, is 0.00904228867698 BTC per month. However lots of variables get into that calc and one of them is luck, don't expect to get exactly the same amount each month, some months will be more profitable than others.

The pool can't return to the address because there's no "from" address where the fee came "from", this is unreliable in bitcoin because it means confusing the "Who" with the "Where"/"From".
The problem is basically that it's not safe to asume that person hasn't already discarded or lost that address or even that he is comfortable with the privacy implications of reusing it.

Maybe when Lightning Network is released, someone should make a lightning hub and call it "Bitcoin Cash", then see if they begin caring about diluted names when it allows virtually infinite tx/s in a completely backwards compatible and even more decentralized fashion so nobody has to bother switching software or splitting the comunity, the chain and the economy alltogether.

1st you avoid buying to people who you don't trust with Bitcoin. If you do really need to deal with someone you don't fully trust, use an escrow, it's probably cheaper than paypal fees, and they usually don't charge a fee at all if there is no dispute.
@_date: 2019-07-10 10:47:08
If you select that option and the merchant runs away with your money, when you try to open a dispute, PayPal will just tell you that since he/she is your "friend", then you go talk to him about giving your money back.

Right now transactions with 10 satoshis per byte are getting confirmed. Considering a standard transaction size of 226 bytes, and a Bitcoin price of $6421.92... That’s 14 and half cents..... you can literally send any amount you want, to anywhere in the world for 14 cents and It will likely get confirmed in less than 2 hours, that’s more than Visa will likely ever do.

Not true.
The smallest bitcoin sub-unit is known as a “Satoshi” and is equivalent to 0.00000001 BTC, though you will have some problems trying to deal with such small amount, ranging from your usual exchange not willing to deal with such amount, going through the fees being higher than the transaction itself, and even to the network rejecting your transaction as dust.

Creating such a block that exploits the bug would require just the usual amount of resources, hardware maintenance and electricity as a normal block, it’s just that the block would be invalid and not provide the miner with the usual block reward and transaction fees. So summarizing, tons of electricity and salaries paid, and 0 payout for all of that.

I came to Bitcoin because it's fast, cheap and secure P2P internet money. I always keep around $20-30 in my wallet and when I'm buying stuff I always take any opportunity to pay with Bitcoin, then later replace the spent Bitcoin by topping my wallet until it is around $20-30 again. Not sure how, but I somehow turned a profit while doing that, when I was shopping and just noticed that after some months and price changes, my previously $30 would now allow me to pay for a $40 cart.

IMHO I never stopped a while to think about the implications of raising the block size to 8MB, though for what I've read, the main problem seems to be that if 8MB blocks where to be filled with transactions, it would be a trouble for average PCs to process. Also 8MB is not even enough if bitcoin where to become mainstream for everyone to use it. Raising the block size even more would cause centralization, as only big servers would be able to process such blocks. Just to keep rising the block size is not a long-term solution.
Nevertheless, that is not the main reason why I refuse to use Bitcoin Cash. The main reason why I refuse to use Bcash is because of the way the main community representatives like Roger Ver are advertising it. It's common to find misleading info in their social media. Roger Ver for example has said things like "blocks are not consensus" or "only miners are full nodes, any other node is slowing down the network" which are provably wrong from a technical point of view and seem to try to stop people running their own full nodes which would defeat the main point of bitcoin, to be decentralized. Following the cases of misleading posts, the  twitter handle (which nobody really knows who is the owner, but by the posts you can clearly say it's in favour of Bitcoin Cash) had posted a tweet suggesting that Bitcoin Cash is the real Bitcoin and that the Bitcoin that we all know is the one that forked. I'm pretty sure lots of people still remember that 1st of august 2017, the day that Bitcoin Cash forked-off Bitcoin to rise the block size, you can still find lots of news headlines from that day talking about it with a quick google search.
Furthermore, both Roger Ver and  on twitter, are heavily advertising the bitcoin(dot)com web page, which is seen by lots of people as an outright scam because the way it attempts to confuse and melt the definitions of Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin. Lots of people blame it for things like calling "Bitcoin Core" to the Bitcoin we all know to create confusion, when in reality, Bitcoin Core is just one out of many implementations of the Bitcoin protocol. Even for a while, in their exchange Bitcoin Cash (BCH) used to be listed as just "Bitcoin" (many people claim to have lost money into that trick) but it was later removed after a collective started a process to sue them.
In the end, what they get is to confuse people into thinking that the Bitcoin that they've heard of, then one that went over $10000 a while ago, the one that many people and all their friends are speaking of is Bitcoin Cash, they get people to think that Bitcoin cash is the *real* Bitcoin.
So, sumarizing, the main reason why I refuse to use Bcash is because this blatant misleading advertising methods. I will not use it until they stop using such advertising methods. If they belive that 8MB block size is the future, then they should proove it to me using honest methods, then, and only then, I'll spend at least a whole day thinking about it.

It looks like your mining income was received in several small transactions. Bitcoin fees are calculated based on the transaction size in bytes, not in the amount worth that is sent. Lots of small transactions means lots of inputs that need to be specified in the transaction which means lots of bytes used which means ridiculous high fees. Sadly the only way to prevent this is by asking to be paid out all at once whenever it's possible instead of fragmenting the pool payouts in small transactions.
Consolidating the unspent outputs means puting all them together and send them to one unique output.
@_date: 2017-02-22 13:24:38

@_date: 2017-02-22 14:30:09
Assuming that by "blockchain" you mean blockchain.info, (which in my opinion is a really bad option for a wallet) yes, you should contact their support and ask them about your transaction having a too low fee and being stuck for 2 days.

Fee market just skyrocketed starting a few weeks ago, at the time of writing this I would send a fee of 180 satoshis per byte if I want to get it confirmed in the next block. If you don't care waiting a few hours there's no problem in sending a bit less.

Yes. Normal wallets let you choose what fee do you want to send, higher fee means your transaction will confirm faster. Blockchain.info doesn't for some reason. I never seen such a extreme case with such high fee so i'm not sure what an appropiate fee would be.
@_date: 2017-02-23 11:04:50

@_date: 2017-02-22 14:25:37
No idea, after 3 days most (not all) nodes will forget about your transaction. From that point its unlikely that a miner picks up your transaction and confirms it (it can still happen though). In the worst case scenario you'll have to rebroadcast the same transaction again, this time with a higher fee. Some wallets make it easy while others (web wallets mostly) will have you to forcefully contact their support to do it for you.

Trying to apply the concept of \`Market Cap\` into cryptocurrencies usually doesn't end well. The concept of market cap originated from stock markets where it *is the market value at a point in time of the shares outstanding of a publicly traded company, being equal to the share price at that point of time times the number of shares outstanding* ([Source](
When applied to cryptocurrencies, the formula used is usually "price \* circulating supply", but that formula was meant to be used for shares backed by enterprises. Bitcoin, being backed by it's own technology and the opportunities it offers, has no outstanding shares in a traditional way.
Now imagine I make a new cryptocurrency called VictorCoin with a supply of 70 billion coins, and then I premine all the supply. If I now take 1 VictorCoin and sell it to Bob for $1, now I can say that the market cap of VictorCoin is 70 billion dollars. Obviously this is meaningless because everything would collapse as soon as I put more coins for sale. Also this is an extreme example, but many shitcoins have used this more subtly to drive up their \`market caps\` in a less noticeable manner.
TL;DR: Market cap for cryptocurrencies is a bad metric and Bitcoin will likely be the most used and decentralized currency for a gooooood while regardless of it's market cap (considering current alternatives, it seems it will take long until someone does something better)

From what I heard, many people have indeed been confused and have fallen into the bait &amp; switch scam that bitcoin(dot)com is.I can totally agree that, if the main BCH promoters really thought that what they are promoting is a good product for their target public, then they would advertise it under their own brand, using a domain such as for example bitcoincash(dot)com. But we can deduce by their actions until now, that they won't because they know what they have made and are promoting is potentially a bad product, so the only way they could market such a thing is by misleading people into thinking that what they are promoting is the same cryptocurrency that has been announced with fanfare in all news media for having reached a value of 20k USD per unit a while back.
@_date: 2019-11-06 15:35:25
From what I’ve seen, most shitcoins just follow the Bitcoin price on different scales most of the time. That means that if you have Bitcoin and want to diversify, using other cryptocurrencies to do so will leave you with mostly the same ups and downs synchronized across all your portfolio, which to me sounds like the exact opposite of diversification. I would suggest to either diversify into something that is not a cryptocurrency, or just DCA Bitcoin

I'm worried about how he says


In Bitcoin, the fees are set and paid by the sender and are relative to the binary size of the transaction, not a percentage of the amount sent. It isn't all that uncommon for exchanges to pass these fees to their customers, but this one almost sounds like he's never used Bitcoin before.


That also sounds kinda sketchy, but also sounds like someone who's had enough bullshit with people asking for 0-fee transactions and then blaming him for having the transaction unconfirmed after more than a week.
@_date: 2018-10-16 11:20:09
You can't assert that though, there are probably a ton of unlikely but possible reasons why the opposite may happen. One of them being that most block explorers assume what you just said, hence, a user may do the opposite on purpose to gain privacy.

True that, recently I've seen lots of people who know nothing or almost nothing about bitcoin have been given the opportunity to speak to really wide publics. A recent example of this would be Roubini at the senate, he seems to know a lot of economics but his investigation on the topic of Bitcoin seems to be limited to reading some FUD news articles, he didn't even seem to read the well-known whitepaper. People like him are being interviewed in all news media and noone seems to be fact-checking what they say before publishing the articles.
@_date: 2017-08-31 09:16:49
The amount transacted doesn't matter. What matters is the transaction size in bytes. Right now something around 0.00294522 BTC/kB (294 sat/B) would most probably confirm in under 20 minutes (sooner is hard to guarantee because of block times, no matter how much fee you add).
@_date: 2017-08-04 01:17:06
And..... that's all? Most people here probably know that, and if somebody doesn't it's pretty much what you get when you search in google about it.

Sounds like either those bitcoins are already spent, or you're missing the private keys necessary to spend them.
@_date: 2017-08-31 09:27:30
Being 1 BTC doesn't matter, either does if it's old or if you send it to yourself. Time and cost depends on the transaction size. Usually transactions are 226 Bytes (unless you are spending from a lot of inputs).
At 294 sat/B and assuming your transaction is like the most common one, that would be a total fee of 0.00066444 BTC.
If you want to be sure, make it 360 sat/B which would be 0.00081360 BTC
But again, it all depends on your transaction size in bytes.

Don't take the .1% as a standard. As I said before, the amount sent doesn't matter. If you sent 0.000001 BTC or 10000  BTC the fee would still be the same.
@_date: 2017-08-31 09:35:22
Comming from the same wallet doesn't directly imply that it's the same input. You wallet's balance could be split if you received the funds in different transactions. Merging those would imply bumping the transaction size and hence the fee.
But so far it sounds like you're fine assuming it's all one input so just use the fees above.

Bitcoin fees have been rediculously low the last week. Some people even got transactions confirmed for less than 1 sat/B (which is weird considering that those are hard to relay due the most node's min fee relay policy).

Technically you can't tell for sure which output is change being sent back to another address on the same wallet and which one is actually being spent (unless the person who sent the transaction tells you). For all purposes, including fee calculation, both outputs look exactly the same in that sense.
You can make a guess about it, which many block explorers attempt to do (and fail most of the time). So the word "Estimated" in that sentence is important.

Bitcoin Core allows you to prune the blockchain and store as few as 550 MB + UTXO set, you still have to download everything for the initial validation though, if the problem is your internet rather than storage there are alternatives to Multibit that don't need to download the whole blockchain such as Electrum.
By the way, the whole blockchain is about 102 GB at the moment.

The article says on a infographic that cryptocurrencies have no intrinsic value... In the case of bitcoin one could argue that it has intrinsic value as a permanent and distributed datastore, other cryptocurrencies may or may not have intrinsic value for it's own reasons, but not having intrinsic value is not something you can apply to cryptocurrencies in general. 
One could also argue that gold's current market price is way over it's intrinsic value because it's considered a store of value, if it wasn't, the price would be much lower considering that the supply of gold is much more than it's industrial requirements.
The only thing in common here is that the value is ultimately determined by supply and demand.

None of the transactions I sent ever took "several hours to be confirmed", the only exception was a transaction that took 5 hours and was because I didn't care so I paid a lower fee to save some cents. Most of the cases where people blames long unconfirmed transactions it's because of poor fees or a transaction backlog caused by a unusual network event that is normally solved in a few hours.
@_date: 2016-11-23 17:12:17
Just wait, is the best i can think of, 1 hour isn't that much compared to others, 67sat/B is a good fee so it shouldn't take that much to go through. If it's someone trying to slow the bitcoin network on purpose he will most probably run out of money to keep paying the fees soon.

I usually do this:
I use Bitcoin Core which has a abandon transaction feature, I wait for 72 hours (default nodes' mempool transaction expiry policy) and then abandon it if it didn't confirm yet. My transaction would still be out there somewhere but abandon transaction makes my wallet pretend it's not so you can double-spend the same coins with higher fee.
RBF is also a good option, if your wallet supports signaling RBF on your transactions you should enable it to make things easier.

There's a huge backlog of bitcoin transactions that where allegedly created by someone trying to spam the network with enough money to pay the fees. That basically means your transaction will take some more than usual to confirm. Anyway, if it's a spammer, eventually he will have flushed all of his money in transaction fees and will have to give up.

Wut? chains can't be hand reorganized and miners are not picked. Also consensus pretty much sets things on stone unless you have a 100%-ish support of the nodes and miners to change it. The most reasonable thing to do in such a case would be to switch the proof of work, and still would be a pain in the arse that would probably end with a bitcoin fork called something like Chinacoin.

That's just blockchain.info trying to guess which output was actually spending bitcoins and which one is the change being sent back to the owner's wallet, there is no way to tell for sure. The bitcoin network doesn't know nor care about what each output is and for fee calculation matters it is irrelevant.

The repairer could have kept a copy of your wallet and used it to spend your bitcoins, though if it was passworded he would have had to brute-force it or guess it. If you used a strong, long and unguessable password it's pretty much impossible.
The virus though, could have keylogged your password as you typed it.
The repairer puting the virus there is also a possibility. If you didn't visit any sketchy sites, and considering that you had a freshly restored system, it's hard to get a virus that fast, unless of course it was already there when you picked your PC up.

The rewards for mining a block aren’t just the newly generated bitcoins, but also the transaction fees included in the transactions that were confirmed in that block. Once no new bitcoins are generated with mining, miners will still be paid with transactions fees.

Being "more profitable" requires demand from the users to adquire that coin. If you want to have a market you need 2 things, a supply and a demand. Having an undefined, potentially infinite supply and no demand at all will result in a market cap of 0. I'd like to be there and see the miner's faces when they realise that they have been mining for months, they have bills to pay, and they can't pay them because there is not even nearly enough market to take all their MinersGetToPrintWhateverTheyWant-Coin because no one really wants to buy that.
Meanwhile in Bitcoin, since the difficulty is adjusted so blocks always come on average each 10 minutes, and those miners recently withdrew their mining power, after the adjustment mining Bitcoin becomes easier for everyone else.
TL;DR You would first have to convince the market that they want to buy and accept a coin where miners get to mint whatever amount of coins they want. Good luck with that.

The reverse is actually more likely to happen. Remember that a fork has two sides. Any attempted change to the protocol by miners can be blocked by non-mining nodes. If miners insist in their attempts to change the consensus and begin mining blocks with different rules, those will be rejected by all nodes who don't follow the same rules. By keeping their efforts, miners risk using their resources to mine coins that are accepted by no one except themselfs, resulting in a huge economical loss. This is definitely bad for everyone, miners loose money and people making transactions get long confirmation times and expensive fees due to fewer miners using the correct rules, but even in this scenario, miners don't get to change the rules at their will. If everyone stands for their consensus rules and don't give up, miners' losses will eventually force them to go out of business or go back to mining with the majority consensus rules. Either case, blocks will eventually come back to 10 minutes average and fees back to normal, be it because miners came back, or because they died trying and difficulty got readjusted.

The key release was actually planned for a while ago as part of the plan to retire the alert system, but it was put on hold because many altcoins forked the code directly from bitcoin core, including the code for the alert system, and didn't even care to replace the public key. So basically if that secret key was released anyone would be able to sign and broadcast messages to those altcoin's networks. I guess at this point, their developers had enough time to fix it and if they didn't it's their own fault.
In the case of bitcoin core, an alert was sent with the max possible serial number. Any alert with a lower serial number will be considered old and an alert with a higher serial is not possible, so old versions should be safe.

Assuming that wallet.dat file is the most recent copy of your wallet, it should contain everything you need to spend your bitcoins. Core is sometimes a bit picky if you copy the wallet.dat file just like that, ideally you should use the File &gt; Backup wallet button, or, if you're in an emergency where you can't get Bitcoin Core to boot properly, at least copy the wallet.dat file together with the chainstate directory. It usually works fine anyway, so that's nothing to worry about, it's just so you know in case your balance doesn't show up or the wallet software begins screaming at you with errors, it doesn't really mean anything. All your keys are still in the wallet.dat file, so there's always a way to get it working.
As a side note, wallets created with old versions of Bitcoin Core didn't have a seed, which is why at that time it was important to make regular backups of your wallet, so your backup didn't have any new keys missing. When you create a wallet with any recent version of Bitcoin Core, it will be a hierarchical deterministic wallet, which means it does have a seed and all keys are derived from it.

Bitcoin Core is the way to go, trying to export the keys into another wallet is a deep well of implications and security issues that you don't want to get into just for this time. Unless you're in a hurry, just let Bitcoin Core do the job, the bottleneck for the initial catch up is usually disk write speeds and/or processing power for validating the transactions, so having a slow internet doesn't really make a difference most of the time anyway. If you have a decent computer and around 10MB/s of bandwidth it should be done in about 3-4 days or less.

At least in the case of Bitcoin the price is determined in balancing act of supply versus demand. When you buy bitcoins, your money goes to whoever sold them to you.
No bitcoin has even been minted out of thin air (and never will). All bitcoins are first put into circulation when they are awarded to miners each time a new block is mined (around each 10 minutes on average), these serve as a reward for securing the bitcoin network which is a time and resource consuming process. It is also well-known that there will never be more than 21 million Bitcoins, since the rewards given to miners are halved each roughly 4 years (more exactly each 210000 blocks), at around year 2140 the amout of new bitcoins created on each block will be virtually 0.
So, here we have a limited supply, now it's time to find out why people are interested in buying bitcoin AKA why is there a demand.
So as it turns out, Bitcoin is the first currency in the world that managed to be both digital and decentralized.
There have been many digital currencies before, but they all depended on a central server, if the server closes their services, then their currency is no longer worth anything. Some examples include that WoW gold wouldn't be worth if WoW game services closed, your Steam balance would be useless if steam stopped selling games and halted all their inventory trading, Tether USD would be worthless if the govt decided to close the bank accounts where the creators hold the USD balance that backs it etc... .
There have also been many decentralized currencies before, gold, silver, oil.... but they all have one common problem and it's that most are hard to granulate and all of them are hard to transfer.
Bitcoin, being the first digital AND decentralized currency solved all of this, it's easy to transfer, easy to granulate, uncensorable and completely impossible to control by a single person or entity (many tried, all failed). Not to mention that the Bitcoin blockchain is also the most open and widely distributed datastore in the world, and that makes it tamper-proof, since any attempt to tamper with it will be spotted on sight by ***literally everyone***. Bitcoin so far has allowed many people in need or under opressive governments to make and receive international transfers for just a couple of cents of a fee (and these fees are directed also to reward miners for their efforts at securing transactions).
So, I think we can agree that Bitcoin is useful for something of general interest, and there is people who acknowledge it, hence, we have a demand.
Now it's your turn to do some research and figure out how much is Bitcoin worth to you.
About the price swings, they basically happen because people change their mind on how much is it worth to them over time and also due to price speculation.
@_date: 2019-10-02 13:06:33
Lost bitcoins increase the scarcity and hence the price of the remaining bitcoins. Think of it as a small donation to everyone else.
If you’re worried about liquidity, you should know that 1 BTC is currently divisible in units as small as 1*10^-8 or 0.00000001 BTC ( this unit is known as one “Satoshi”). It is also possible to upgrade the protocol in the future to allow further and smaller divisions if that ever becomes a need. 
Notice this has been asked already many times in the past and has been answered already. Due to that, some people may call you out for trying to manipulate other people’s opinion with this unnecessary duplicate questions of FUD topics. Try to do some research and search if your question has already been asked somewhere else before posting.

It's true that full nodes validate and relay transactions, but you don't earn nothing for just doing that at all.
Ideally you would have your bitcoin wallet in that full node, that way you are earning security and privacy since, unlike a lightweight wallet which relies on third-party servers to broadcast and validate transactions, a full node will validate everything by itself so you can trust no one but your own wallet.
Running a full node without using it as your wallet kinda helps the bitcoin network by adding some decentralization to it, but you will not receive any compensation for doing it (except maybe if someone is actively donating money to full node owners as an incentive, but these kind of giveaways were more common in the past).

Not true. What you just said is the equivalent of saying “A lot of html and http developers work for google Which is a company with investors”.
What google actually does is working on their own web and html render engine called chromium which is just one out of many implementations.
A similar thing applies to Bitcoin, most blockstream workers contribute code to one out of many implementations of the Bitcoin protocol called Bitcoin Core which is considered by many developers to be the reference implementation due to the high quality of the code. Though blockstream workers are not the only ones pushing code, many other companies and individuals push code simply because it’s the best of their interests to make Bitcoin work better or as a code exercise and practice.
That doesn’t mean they own it or that they have any control over the Bitcoin network though. If they ever tried to push any change that is perjudicial to the users there would be heads rolling on the ground. And I know that for sure because when they tried to implement SegWit, which is generally regarded as a good thing that is beneficial to all users and that so far has proven it’s effectiveness, there was already a lot of drama and misinformation going around, and I would go as far as saying that it’s implementation got delayed a couple of months due to that and rogue miners trying to push their own agenda (which they finally failed to).
So... yeah. Definitely not possible to push anything unless an overwhelming majority of users agree with. No one can force you to run full mode software with rules that you don’t agree with. If a good chunk of the Bitcoin Core developers that contribute most of the code went rogue, it would certainly be a big hit in the developer space, but we most certainly have viable alternatives to choose from without even breaking the consensus.
If after all that you’re still convinced that development could be done better, pull requests are welcome :D

Miners mine the blocks using a template. This template is created by each miner individually and can include whatever transactions they want (usually, the ones with the highest fees).

50 sat/byte sounds like a good fee, however, for a standard transaction of 226 bytes that should only cost you £0.65.
The £20 fee you say you paid suggests that your transaction merged a lot of different small received transactions to satisfy the amount of bitcoins you sent raising it's size in bytes to something around 6937 bytes (I could check this further if you provide a transaction ID).
Lots of people use  to get fee estimates. I personally like to see my own mempool and check how congested is the network to set my fees accordingly.

I hope you're being sarcastic. If users don't agree with that change, miners risk mining some coins that are rejected by the majority of users, wallets and services, making them worthless. Miners are ecouraged by game theory to stick with the current consensus unless **everyone** agrees that a change is needed. This consensus includes rules such as the 21M cap and it's really easy to spot and reject anyone breaking those rules on sight. If a miner ignores this and keeps mining this worthless rejected-by-everyone-except-themselves coins, they may never able to pay the expenses of that mining operation.
The only way miners could make a change that is not in the best interest of the users is by some sort of political campaign that misleads users into thinking that this change is actually good and needed and convinces them to accept such coins and give them a value.

So, after asking around a bit, apparently what that means is that Bitcoin Core in pruned mode does relay blocks. Only that a normal node contacting a pruned node would just fetch any block the peer told them about, and both, pruned and not pruned, would tell their peers about new blocks, but noone would try to fetch any older block from a pruned node because the pruned nodes would be explicitly claiming to not have them.
Then in a later PR, NODE\_NETWOK\_LIMITED was implemented, and with it nodes can announce to their peers what blocks do they have.
Knowing that, I'm pretty sure that at least on the latest version pruned nodes can relay the blocks they have available properly.

This means exactly what it says, the block database is corrupted and it needs to be rebuilt. Most probable causes for this are an unproper shutdown of Bitcoin Core and/or your computer (i.e. electricity outage, a blue screen or a task kill) or a disk failure. Clicking OK should begin with the process of rebuilding it. 
If this is not the first time it happens and it has happened several times recently and there was no unproper shutdown, it may mean your disk is failing, if that's the case, you should do a full system backup and then use a disk checking tool to check the disk integrity and functionality. If you find your disk is failing too much, you should think about adquiring a new one.

When you issue a transaction in the BTC network, technically that transaction is also valid in the BCH network.

Atempting to do it outside of a professional laboratory by unqualified personnel will only increase the chances of destroying all data that was recoverable.

My guess is that the site's fee estimator went nuts with so many imputs.
About your question, the transaction fees are supposed to be an incentive for miners to confirm your transaction. The whole fee value goes to the miner that adds your transaction to a block.
There are some known sites that will intentionally overrate fees with several purposes. The most popular purposes go from directly taking the extra fee for their profit or making a deal with some mining company; to claiming bitcoin fees are too high and use the situation to advertise some shit altcoin. Some will also do it to increase the average fee for recent past transactions, a statistic that lots of fee estimators look for when doing their calcs.
 
Yet another reason to not use web wallets and get a desktop wallet instead.

I think (don't quote me on that) relaying available blocks with Bitcoin Core in pruned mode has always been a thing. The only thing that was added recently (probably 2 or 3 years ago) is wallet functionality in pruned mode. Prior to that pruning your node would mean that you could no longer use all wallet functionality.

Miners get paid the transaction fees for all the transactions they add to a block. While 0 fee transactions are technically possible, in the practice miners will widely prefer transactions with a higher fee which usually leads 0 or low fee transactions to stay unconfirmed for a long while.
When all the coins are mined and the block reward is over, miners will keep getting the transaction fees.

My favourite is Bitcoin Core, it's a heavy beast and it's initial sync will take a while, but it's a full node so you will never have to depend on anyone else to tell you whether the bitcoin you receive are valid or not or to broadcast your transactions.

You don't need to keep your computer on 24/7 nor store 150+ GB.
Turning it on from time to time already helps the bitcoin network (though having it on 24/7 would help more, the more time, the better).
And pruning can delete old blockchain data and can leave as few as 550 MiB + UTXO set and still be a full node helping the network (Though it helps more to keep it whole as you can also help bootstraping new nodes)

If you follow the instructions of whatever mining software/pool you use you should be prompted for a payout address at some point. Just use the address your wallet gives you.
As a side note, mining with CPUs or GPUs is not efficient and should only be done expecting losses or in the name of learning/science. To mine efficiently you would need:
1. An Application Specific hardware device known as ASIC designed to do double sha256 operations as fast and efficient as possible.
2. Electricity at a ridiculously low or free rate
Otherwise, expect an increase in the electricity bill for more value than the bitcoins you will make.

Most common cause for that is too low fees, but this guy says he knows what he does with fees so next most common cause I can think of is bad propagation. I've sent lots of transactions with proper fees and using my own node which spreads transactions quite fast and wide and I've never had a transaction taking more than expected to confirm.

Based on TA, if people believe it's going back to $2800 due to indicators, they will sell their Bitcoins, which will make it go to $2800 causing a self-fulfilling prophecy.
Based on general sentiment from my point of view, trying to short bitcoin is equivalent to gambling, but lots of people who try to get rich quick don't know that so they loose their money, you can only effectively predict the price of Bitcoin in the long term.
Based on my own experience and seeing how things worked for people I know, Bitcoin price is really volatile if looking at short windows, so it is usual that people who initially planned to hold it for long, panicked and sold when the price was low and dropping (when the objective was obviously to buy low and sell high). In my case, this is not an issue, because I keep spending my Bitcoins on Amazon gift cards, food, clothes and shopping in general, then I replace the Bitcoins I spent by buying more, if the price goes down then I get the next batch of BTC that I buy for cheaper, if it goes up then the ones I already have are worth more, either case I win.

The transaction you linked there is at the tip of a long chain of unconfirmed transactions. This transaction cannot confirm until all it's parent transactions have been confirmed. Furthermore, the root unconfirmed transaction which seems to be 71d71e45f653c9078056e262b5880ba9274a553f92e565c827df55ef7d073828 has been double-spent into a conflicting transaction (28ec872a7438d08ceb00ab2dca7e88f0711541181973ecdcb6dafb335d74dc7b) which is confirmed since block 464018. Since this conflicting transaction is confirmed, there's no possible way the unconfirmed root, and all it's child transactions will ever confirm, you can consider that transaction chain orphaned since there's an alternative reality that is considered to be the true and effective one one.
Probably you double-spent them with a higher fee?

The fastest and easiest way to download the blockchain is to sync it using Bitcoin core. Downloading it from a web page or FTP will be way slower due to server's limited bandwidth. Using torrent will download it faster than a web page, but then when you pass it to bitcoin core it will have to validate everything which could take more than the download itself depending on your hardware. If you use Bitcoin Core's network sync it will download as fast as your internet allows and validate it simultaneously hence making it the fastest way to do it.

What happens is that what most people do is they import the private key into their desktop wallet, spend a part of their bitcoins and then delete the wallet file from the computer so their key is no longer on it. Sounds like a great idea doesn't it?
Well, it isn't, and if you thought it was you just lost all your bitcoins. 
Bitcoin transactions spend the whole balance on the UTXO, and then, send the change to a new address on the same wallet known as "change address", if you delete your desktop wallet file then those bitcoins are gone for good. 
Before deleting the wallet file on your desktop you should send the remaining change back to the paper wallet, or preferably to a new paper wallet.

Any decent wallet should let you choose what fee do you want to add. Fees are taken by the miner that adds your transaction into a block (and hence, confirms it), so the more fee you add, the more hurry you will push into miners to confirm your transaction. The problem comes when you face fees of which you do not have control of. For example, if you're using a web wallet service, that service may choose to charge you a withdrawal fee each time you move bitcoins out, or if you're using a payment processor to send a payment to a merchant, that one may also choose to charge you for processing the transaction (api services, escrow, confirming to the merchant that the payment was made, taking care of the merchant's wallet etc...) If you're using a web wallet that charges you such high fees, the best you can do is tell them that it sucks, switch to another wallet and move on.

1. The blockchain is distributed peer to peer, without a central server, when you run a full wallet you connect to other people's computers to download it, then other people connects to your computer to do the same..
2. A Bitcoin address is a hash of a cryptographic public key which is derived from a private key, even if someone guessed your address it would not be possible to use it to spend your bitcoins, addresses only receive.
Spending bitcoins requieres knowing the private key from which the address was derived of, sure you could try to guess someone's private key, but with an average luck that would take about 10 trillion years.... let's be realistic, it won't happen, the earth might as well explode in the next 5 minutes.

Not sure but I think since SegWit activation, covert AsicBoost is broken (Allegedly one of the main reasons why some miners where against it's activation). The only thing they could do now is use overt AsicBoost. That means that if needed, a Soft-Fork could be made to reject those blocks. I have to research more over the current state of AsicBoost to be sure.

I heard people saying full nodes are too heavy to run for home users. I can guarantee that at the time of writing this that is a lie. I've been running one since 2015 on my laptop and it works like a charm.  There's also lots of people running it on a RPi. If your computer has a reasonably recent hardware you should definitely run a full node. It will both protect your bitcoins against malicious forks and increase the security of bitcoin in general for everybody.

Bitcoin works with consensus rules, rules that are enforced by each and every full node. Nodes will deem transactions and blocks that don't meet the rules invalid.
A Hard-fork is basically a version of the protocol which breaks some of this consensus rules and causes blocks and transactions made with it to be invalid at the eyes of the currently existing nodes, however, for the eyes of those running the hard-fork client those are perfectly valid, hence causing a split in the network and separating the clients that support the hard-fork and those who don't into 2 different coins, 2 versions of the reality.
Anyone can make a hard-fork, but if nobody supports it's useless, it's like:
-HF-Node: Hey, I make my own rules, here, take a block which respects my own rules instead of yours
-BTC-Node: Nope, not valid.

There's  on the Paper Wallet tab.
It allows you to create a wallet on a paper and print it.
It has it's own bitcoin address on one QR, and the key to spend the bitcoins in it on the other QR.
Make sure to download the page and run it in a offline computer for security reasons.
Generate the wallet and print it.
Then you send BTC to the address on the left and give it to whoever you want.
To redeem it, he/she can use the key on the right. Most mobile wallets have a function to sweep private key QRs, on desktop wallet he/she will probably have to input the key manually.

The problem comes when you're coding that and you're supposed to define when is the mempool supposed to be considered empty. The mempool is not part of the consensus, each node has it's own pool of transactions with variable size and it doesn't need to match other nodes' mempools.
So, back to our problem: how do you tell the consensus code the definition of "empty mempool" without it disagreeing with other nodes?

Here's some basic logic
If you put money into someone or something and then receive double back, that means that someone else or some group that is receiving your investment or a part of it directly or indirectly and must be paying you the double. If that person or group isn't earning profits through a business, then you are basically exploiting them, but they will eventually notice that an stop doing it to stop their losses or just run out of money, 99.9999% of the time it will be gone before you even notice they were giving out money at their loss. The other way is that they ARE earning huge profits through a business, but then again, in a free market, 99.9999% of the time some other company will figure out how they're making such a huge profit and drown it through competition before you even have a chance.
For the last scenario, let's invert the chances:
Since there is only a 0.0001% chance that you're actually exploiting some person's or group's profits (or losses), and you are in front of someone promising huge profits in a short time (specially when there is no business plan), then there must be a 99.9999% chance that **IT IS A SCAM**.
TL;DR Money is not free, earning it without giving something equal in exchange means that someone is loosing it, and if something quacks like a scam, it's because it's a duck (it's a scammer duck though).

There is only one successfully mined block in the world each 10 minutes on average. If new miners begin their operations or upgrade their hardware to a more powerful model then blocks would be mined faster than each 10 minutes average. Difficulty is just a function that sets how hard it is to mine new blocks so that no matter how much (or how little) mining power is the world throwing into mining, it will always take 10 minutes on average.
Price is just set by the balancing act of supply and demand. One would think that if mining is harder then bitcoins would be more expensive, but it just so happens that it works the other way around. If bitcoin’s price goes up, more miners will have interest in starting their operations and difficulty will increase. If price goes down, mining will become unprofitable, causing some miners to drop their operations, then difficulty will go down hence making mining profitable again.

Bcash developers solve problems by ignoring them and creating a new coin instead. Fortunately, the economic majority cares about their money and doesn't want a shitcoin to destroy it.

That's because a transaction is never "cleared" at all, while most nodes keep the default setting of 72 hours, some keep transactions for a undefined amount of time or even forever until it's confirmed. Once a transaction is signed and broadcasted it will always be out there somewhere, which means that a miner can eventually add it into a block and confirm it.

Cryptocurrencies competing against each other would be perfectly fine. But unfortunately this is way worse, and OP's screenshot is a perfect example of it, it's about a group of people misleading the public for own profit.
As you can see in the outlined area of the screenshot, the site lists 2 currencies, Bitcoin (BCH) and Bitcoin Core (BTC). As a matter of a fact, there is no such coin as "Bitcoin Core".
BTC or "Bitcoin" as we all know since 2009, is a protocol or an economic unit where "Bitcoin Core" is one out of many wallet implementations.
BCH is known as "Bitcoin Cash" or "Bcash". Though the site on the screenshot is listing it as just "Bitcoin" in an attempt to forcefully take the brand and mislead people into thinking it's the coin that's being spoken of on the news or in friend-to-friend conversations.
Lots of news media have spoken about Bitcoin being over $10000 a while ago, but BCH has never achieved such a thing at the time of writing this, however if this kind of lies keep spreading people will begin thinking so.
Far from the page being shown in the screenshot, associated people and companies have been spreading tons of misleading info all over the media like for example [this]( which is provably false by anyone with enough understanding of the protocol.
This is why, though some people comming from may not understand the situation, anyone who is aware of this will get upset whenever they read Bcash is spreading bullshit again like attempting to call it just "Bitcoin" or "The real Bitcoin".
That's why this kind of war between and started, because it's really upsetting to not be able to do anything about it other than posting a comment explaining it, even if that means getting downvoted to oblivion by both missinformed people and [bots](

If you're using version 0.13.0 or newer you can go to the transactions tab, right click the transaction and select "Abandon transaction"
If you're using version 0.12.0 or newer you can go to Help &gt; Debug window &gt; console tab, write `abandontransaction &lt;transactionid&gt;`and then hit enter
Open a system terminal and write `bitcoin-cli abandontransaction &lt;transactionid&gt;` (this will likely not work on Windows)
If you're on a version older than 0.12.0 create a file named bitcoin.conf on the bitcoin data directory and with a text editor such a Notepad write on it `zapwallettxes=1` then shut down bitcoin core and start it again. When you finish make sure to remove the bitcoin.conf file, otherwise it will do the process each time you start it.
Shut down bitcoin core, open a system terminal and write `bitcoind -zapwallettxes=1` (this will likely not work on Windows)
Consider updating bitcoin core, the lastest version is recomended.

The problem here is that there are lots of ways to fail that promise such as the site being DDoSed which would prevent you to log-in or their servers being hacked which in most cases will result in coins theft, the company declaring bakruptcy and you never seeing your coins back.
If after all this you still want to use a web wallet, please don't use blockchain.info, they're terrible as a wallet.
Also please don't call it just "blockchain"; blockchain.info and "The Bitcoin Blockchain" are different things. Calling it just "blockchain" is confusing for some people.

You can't do chargebacks in bitcoin, which is nice in most cases, but you probably don't want somebody to sell smoke and run away with the money.

Bitcoin Core doesn't know about your transaction because it didn't download it yet, wait for the sync to finish and your balance should show.

I heard some withdrawals are already getting through, maybe you should try to get them into a desktop wallet like Electrum. Worst-case, your bitcoins will stay in the limbo until coinbase gets everything sorted. Yet another reason why I don't use web wallets.

I remember there was a web tool that allows you to broadcast a raw signed transaction only to specific pools of your choice. If you broadcasted some high fee transactions to pools that are known to signal segwit that would be a good incentive. Can't remember where that web was though.

Fractional reserve banking uses a lot of energy too, think about it, the wastefulness of mining gold out of the ground, melting it down and shaping it into bars, and then putting it back underground again. Not to mention the building of big fancy buildings, the waste of energy printing and minting all the various fiat currencies, the transportation thereof in armored cars by no less than two security guards for each who could probably be doing something more productive, etc.
Seen from that point of view Bitcoin might even be saving energy.

A group of people is releasing a bitcoin fork called Bcash, since at the time of release, for each Bitcoin you have you will also have 1 Bcash that will cause some problems with people dumping and selling Bcash. Lots of people are moving funds out of coinbase to their own wallets to ensure they will have access to those Bcash and Coinbase is halting withdrawals to ensure the coins are secure.

Fees are not relative to the amount transacted, they're relative to the transaction size in bytes. In your case, the funds came from 101 different inputs each of which needs to be specified in the transaction hence bumping the transaction size to 14,936 Bytes when a standard transaction size is 226 Bytes.

Never leave coins on a exchange (unless you plan to operate with them). The exchange could go down at any time for any reason (just search on google BTC-e seizure). While there is no imminent danger it's not a good idea to just leave the coins there sitting for long. If a paper wallet sounds like too much hassle to you, best go for the middle point, use a desktop wallet. Bitcoin Core and Electrum are the best, they will allow you to hold the coins at your own computer. Just make sure to properly backup the wallet and if you choose electrum to write the seed in a secure place.
@_date: 2017-07-30 09:53:41
Even if ALL electrum servers go down you can still use electrum to sign transactions and then broadcast them by other mediums. Many web pages have a pushtx utility. You can also ask somebody who has a full node to broadcast it for you.
@_date: 2017-07-30 09:42:55
The addresses are calculated from the seed with some fancy math. To prevent the same address from popping out again and again and get your address list filled all with the same address, electrum uses a nonce. This nonce identifies the ordinal position of the address and is what makes the difference when calculating it. So, at the time of restoring the wallet's addresses and private keys, electrum grabs the seed, calculates with nonce 1 and searches the blockchain to see if that address has ever received any funds, then nonce 2 etc. Electrum can have virtually infinite addresses, so it can't just keep searching forever, there must be a limit, the gap limit, at which electrum assumes you haven't used any more addresses.

Child Pays For Parent is not useful here since the coins are destinated to the exchange address. You may be able to use RBF if the transaction you already sent is flagged as replaceable. If it isn't, then you'll have to double-spend it with a higher fee.
@_date: 2017-05-14 10:31:05
Your transaction has a fee of 100 sat/B which is a bit low. (maybe fee estimated by the blockchain.info wallet?)
Right now 220 sat/B would be a good fee.
If you sent this from a web wallet, consider contacting their support.
If you sent this from a local desktop or mobile wallet consider investigating about RBF and/or Child Pays For Parent.
If none of those are available to you, remember, in bitcoin, if it's not confirmed, then it never happened, so your coins are not lost. Try to find a way to make your wallet stop assuming the coins are not yours anymore so it lets you spend them again with a higher fee.
If you're not in hurry, you can also simply wait, it should confirm eventually even though the time needed for it is uncertain.
@_date: 2017-07-02 10:07:09
It won't show until it updates up to the date you received/mined the bitcoins, just wait.

From the point of view of someone who is not using segwit the blocks are still 1MB. From the point of view of someone who is using segwit, the one that is not using it is attaching signatures to the 1MB space for transactions instead of putting them in the witness commitment and is using more block space. Considering that (not sure, citation needed) for fee calculation purposes witness data costs 4x less than the rest, there's a huge incentive to use SegWit.
@_date: 2017-07-31 08:22:59
Coinbase already warned they would be halting transactions near Aug 1st due to the upcoming release of Bcash. The page shows a warning about the bitcoin network being congested which is shady as fuck because it isn't. Anyway, it should be ok in a couple of days.

You don't need the private key for this, just send the bitcoin from one wallet to the other as you would with a normal transaction.
Also, if you want to be ready for anything you should move the funds to an address that YOU and ONLY YOU control. Moving them around websites that hold the bitcoin for you and promise to let you withdraw at any time (a promise that many have already failed) won't solve anything.
Just install Bitcoin Core or Electrum, backup the wallet and/or backup seed and enjoy being your own bank.
@_date: 2017-07-09 09:41:34

Yep, that's pretty much a nope. HD wallets are basically wallets that generate addresses deterministically from a seed. Since the same seed would bring the same addresses on each copy that would have solved your problem. Core wallets are HD by default in all recent versions, but wallets generated in older versions are still non-hd and will show that message when upgrading.
@_date: 2017-07-31 08:10:54
That unknown address you say is a change address. The bitcoin protocol doesn't allow to spend outputs partially so all the balance has to be spent. The amount you specified was sent to the other wallet, and then bitcoin core generated a new address to send the remaining change back to itself.

Maybe you could try to get the private key of the bitcoin address and import it into a litecoin wallet. No idea if it will work, but worth trying.
@_date: 2017-07-30 18:01:06
Yeah, 0 fee transactions are usually poorly relayed as most nodes consider them spam or dust. You should find a way to make your wallet stop asserting the coins have been spent and then find a way to spend them again without getting the transaction rejected. After 72 hours most nodes should have forgotten about the first transaction and should allow you to broadcast and relay a new one with a higher fee.
@_date: 2017-07-29 19:52:32
Is the wallet HD?
@_date: 2017-07-31 15:09:37
Yes, as long as you are in control of your private keys you should be fine. Just be careful what software you export them to, BCC will bring lots of fake wallets.
@_date: 2017-07-09 09:20:40


Wut? Could you rephrase that? Something in there makes so little sense that my head just can't understand it.
You can receive bitcoins even if you're offline. You only need internet to *notice* you have received them so the wallet updates the balance.


Addresses are just a bunch of random numbers and letters generated with fancy math, you can do math with a paper and a pen and none is connected to the internet, so basically, no.
@_date: 2017-07-02 10:11:39
99.999% of cloud mining sites are a scam, the remaining 0.001% you are simply betting on variability and then paying a fee to the site, basically relying all the risk on you. Nex time just use the money to buy bitcoins at a exchange, you'll get more for it.

The private key generation is random, you can modify the code as much as you want, but you will never be able to recover the randomness used to generate the keys on my wallet. Knowing the address, you can't guess what is the right private key for it. You would have to keep trying private keys at random and there are 2^160 possible bitcoin addresses. The sun would eat the earth before you can even check half of them!
@_date: 2017-07-25 13:56:55

Bitcoin classic is really outdated, the devs of that wallet have already moved onto Bitcoin Unlimited and soon probably will move into Bitcoin Cash, all those are failed attempts to fork bitcoin into their own interests and Bcash is still yet to see how it ends (hint: probably the same).
@_date: 2018-12-25 12:14:17
The answer is simple: Why not? It allows lightning network and all kinds of smart contracts to work better, malleability can also be used to fill nodes' memory pools with duplicate transactions which won't clear until one of the two confirms, potentially making a DoS attack against a node a lot easier. Even if you don't like/care about LN and/or smart contracts in Bitcoin, or think that nodes can handle these attacks perfectly, it's always better to fix it now there's plenty of time rather than in a rush and badly later when it's actually needed for whatever other reason.
@_date: 2017-07-30 09:56:13

By default it won't accept transactions with less than 0.00001000 BTC fee into it's mempool, this is mostly to prevent transaction spam from other nodes, but this same measure will also prevent you from spawning new transactions with lower fees into it. You can change this running the bitcoin process with -mintxfee=0. The question is, why would you want to do that? Your transaction will be poorly relayed and marked as spam by most nodes out there, might still confirm though, but it's not what people usually does.

Pruning removes old blockchain data and leaves only the last N MiB of your choice. The minimum you have to store is 550 + UTXO set (aproximately around 2GB at this moment). It's a really useful feature for those who don't have enough disk space, you will still be validating everything and if you're on a reasonably recent version of core you will still be able to use the wallet features.
@_date: 2017-06-25 17:58:56
If the wallet that generates the private keys is random enough there's no AI that can figure out any pattern. And without a pattern to follow the only thing remaining is traditional brute-force, which would be ridiculous compared with bitcoin's order of magnitude.
@_date: 2017-06-03 10:57:07
On the bright side, you could as well send 1 million USD for the same fee since the only thing that matters is the transaction size in bytes. Sure your VISA doesn't do that.
On the dark side, yes, fees are ridiculous, we could already have segwit deployed and active. I don't care about the block size debate, we can have a well-planned hard-fork later on top of segwit if it's not enough, but with all the political agendas out there I don't even know if BU supporters really want the hard-fork or just want to block segwit to keep the fees high.
@_date: 2017-06-11 09:56:07
Do you have enough disc space available? If you don't you should try pruning your blockchain.
@_date: 2017-06-03 12:44:07
If the wallet is corrupt, an update may attempt to migrate it's format to a new version which would only make the corruption worse. If you have your wallet or it's seed properly backed up or the wallet it's just fine it shouldn't be a problem.

Just enjoy the sunny day :D
@_date: 2017-06-10 12:23:36
If we're all lucky and there's no hard-fork everything will be just the same.
If there's a hard-fork then it will be like an alternate reality, you'll have the same amount of coins on each chain as you had right before the fork. You'll be able to spend your coins in one chain or the another separately and when receiving coins you'll receive them only on the chain where the sender is at.
TL;DR: It's a mess and a chaos but it's unlikely that you loose any bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-06-11 11:27:36
