$100 in bitcoin?!  What do you need $60 for? $40 is a lot of money.

I'm with ya.  Sorry but I was there in 2013.  It happened in December then as well.  This doesn't look like a mini blip to me.  This looks the same.   Could be wrong though.

Did you do anything about it or do you know of anything?  I know there is a settlement going on, but I think people are getting literally less than 5% of their investment which is near criminal.

Not really. I was buying for long hold.  Only reason I moved my coins to cryptsy was because of the variety of coins I could exchange for.  Some of them were exchanged for alt coins.   I bought a lot of Doge coins on day  of them hitting the exchange.  Not even sure if those are up or down since.

It was on the cryptsy website, along with many other's.   The actual owner of the exchange stole EVERYONE'S coins and cashed them out.

how did you even know to invest in ETH at that time?  That was just before it exploded.

I'm not sure I'll ever return unless it's to jump on a quick hype train of a new currency like ethereal. 
Maybe I'm pessimistic but because it's so "easy" for these companies to steal from investors and the investors have next to zero chance of every getting their coin back, I think eventually this train is going to come crashing.
There's no since in some of us losing hundreds of thousands of dollars with no fail safe. Nothing. Sorry I'm done.

25 BTC worth.  Or $150,000 .   I get that there is a hype train right now, but people don't understand just how easily this can go south.  I'm not saying don't invest, but truthfully understand it can completely disappear without ANY payback. People are putting in thousands of dollars. I put in $25,000 of my own(I bought BTC ranging between $800 to $1200 per coin.  This was before the crash of 2013).  That's not a small amount of money for me.  I had a lot of faith in it which is why I invested so much.  Lost it all.

Honestly I'm a bad person to ask... I switched over to working the stock market. Its a lot more consistent.  I still believe in BTC, but it was completely demoralizing to have such a big sum of money stolen.

Sorry to hear that...  It really hurt me when it happened.  I was all in on bitcoin and altcoins.  I haven't given one cent into cryptocurrency since.  Completely knocked the wind out of me.  Did you ever get back in?

Sounds kinda like my story. I started 4 years ago, except I have $0 now because all my coins were stolen by Cryptsy.com . Would have $150k right now. Instead I have $0

Dang, sorry it happened to you.  Really sucks. :/
