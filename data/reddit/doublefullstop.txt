Who gives this guy a 20k loan?
@_date: 2017-11-13 00:49:43
I can't remember the exact date but it was when it was £20.
The question wasn't can I afford £20, it was can I afford to potentially throw away £20. I was just in my mid teens at the time.

Nice. Bought at 8500 yesterday

If this is true, why aren't more people buying btc and raising the price?

I've been using coinify in the UK. It's pretty good although the wait for the confirmation email takes about 10 minutes and feels much slower.
They have a 3% commission charge which I don't mind as btc has gone up 45% since I bought in

I disagree.
This kind of thing has happened before and Google restores the reviews.
T_D tried giving the CNN app bad reviews but they were all removed.

The story line is the same but Homer sells his company shares, not bitcoin.

I'm so glad he's still active on reddit.
To be fair, I'd eat my left ball also for the jump from 2015 to 2017, I just didn't have the money then.

That's about my entire investment and all I can afford.
I'm still salty about ~8 years ago when I thought you had to buy an entire bitcoin so reluctantly declined because it was too much for my broke ass.

Growth is exponentially more difficult.
Imagine making your own currency and it goes from $1 to $2 because your friend is on board.
It's harder when we're dealing with billions.

Will that dip be to a level lower than a few weeks ago? Probably not so if you're thinking of buying, the ship may sail.
If it does dip below that, it would be worrisome and I would steer away

I have no wage and am just a student. But 50% of my monthly savings will be going into BTC.
I run a small affiliate marketing website, that I coded myself. It got about $600 in october but has now been wiped off the face of the internet (onto the second page of Google). I must have really messed up something.
I'm happy to put the entire $600 into advertising the site but just need for the ad agency to pay. They've been delaying a lot.
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:53:21
Wow, so you value your testicle at $200?

I want to but have no money. The best I can do is buy 0.010 BTC.
It's killing me but I don't want to be crazy and get a loan.

I had $60 in mid 2014 but then my cousin showed me the world of online dice games. I lost the whole thing. :(

Other apps can make use of he screenshot feature. This could allow another malicious app to screenshot your sensitive information. Most banking apps make use of this restriction.
