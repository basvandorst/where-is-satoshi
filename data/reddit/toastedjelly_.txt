Yes.  They have rectified everything.  I understand technical issues are technical issues, and maybe the support I got ahold of when it actually happened had just never seen it before?  Regardless.  Everything is fixed.
The resolution took a little while, then again it was a very abnormal circumstance.  But I am very happy to see it taken care of.  
I can confirm Cloudbet is literally the best (bitcoin) online vegas there is.  Great interface. Odds spanning the world and live online casino.  I love it and they actually do follow through with every issue that I've ever had.  
Never had a problem with withdraws. Lightning fast deposits. Live sports.
Shit, this is starting to sound more like a fake bot review than anything else.
Either way, thank you and I am happy to back.  I was not a big fan of anything else I saw out there when lined up next to you!

Seeing this beauty coughing and struggling made me well up a little. 
This was my only BTC rig. Used to have four milk crates for LTC then, inevitably for all those dickhead party crasher alts.... But I decommissioned them, built insane gaming PCs for my 6 year old nephew and I and sold off the rest.
The point is this.
This is the first night in just over 2 years there isn't one, single, anything mining cryptos in my house right now.
And I feel REALLLLLLY weird and sad.

I really dig the concept and am sure I'm gonna take a bunch of shit for this next comment, but only in America can you be homeless and panhandling with a cell phone and a Bitcoin wallet ;)
(I know not all homeless people have cell phones but believe me I've seen more and more recently in Philly, PA and NYC area) 
Everyones got priorities I suppose.  And also needs a place to accept phone calls for potential jobs......trying to cover all my bases here so don't pile on to much

It's not the same.  Something about walking into a room humming with 20+ gpus , compared to a GridSeed or Scrypt asic rig.  It's also FAR less profitable.
I have a GBlade (7mhs) picked up from zoomhash a few months back but both blades are dead now as nothing registers.  
I miss mining as a hobby and computers as my friends :/

EDIT: MY ISSUE WAS VERY ABNORMAL AND ALTHOUGH IT DID TAKE AN EXTRA DAY OR TWO TO STRAIGHTEN OUT, THEY ABSOLUTELY SAW TO IT THAT IT DID!  IMO THIS IS THE BEST AND MOST RELIABLE BTC SPORTSBOOK AND CASINO ON THE NET!
I am/was a fan until last night.  I messed around for a little bit on the tables (non-live) 3 card poker  for almost an hour.  Server lags caused a couple disconnects and once reloaded the coins I already had on the table up and disappeared.  Once it was both my initial and 'in' bet and the other it was just the 'in' (2nd) bet.  0.06 BTC gone. POOF never to be returned to my wallet. But, whatever, it was Saturday night and I had a decent week of winnings.
So I go to the live casino for roulette.  First couple hands went fine then at 4:30am EST literally my last hand before I passed out, I place 0.05 BTC on 1-12 and 0.02 on 1-18. Received the normal confirmation "Bets SUCCESSFULLY placed" wait wait wait WIN! Time for....then a messag pops up and says "Your last bets were not counted and the coins will be refunded to your account" the girl stares weirdly at the screen and motions for another girl to come look at it. They both stare for a few seconds and shrug their soldiers and move on.
I get back the coins I bet, but NOT the coins I won. So now I'm missing 0.12 from roulette and 0.06 from 3 card poker. POOF 
I immediately contact support get someone about a minute after it happens and I explain. Support says "That happened 15 minutes ago, there was an issue with our ISP" and that's it!  I said so where's my BTC?  nothing.  
Wrote an e-mail before work this morning at 10am EST (no sleep) and haven't heard back.  
Honestly it's kind of bullshit.  It's one thing if the feed cut and we were disconnected completely. Or if I didn't receive both a message telling my that my bets were placed successfully. Or if I hadn't seen the ball drop in my sections and the girls just stare stupidly at the screen.
For support to dismiss it by saying plainly 'no that did not just happen that happened 15 minutes ago' and blaming it on the ISP?!  
Pull the tape OP!! Live casino roulette table at 4:30 am EST  on 5.19.14   I'm sure every piece of what you do is recorded. So please put me in touch with who at your company is going to own up to this bogus act or send me my BTC?
You may be breaking new ground with your live btc casino but that doesnt mean you can excuse technical issues on your side by blaming them on your ISP and simply washing your hands of it.  PM me, check all my loyalty points, do what you need to do.  
So far the support has been severely lacking.

I feel at least relatively confident this varies greatly depending on your geographical location.  I can't speak first hand on the rest of the world, but I've seen very much the difference between a street performer in a tourist spot, and one in a 'locals only' urban area.  There's a pretty big difference and it's a broadly used term.

Please show me an exchange that allows one to manually set their own miner fees, thereby removing this fault (underpaid /stagnant fees set in place by a third party) in the face of rising miner fees. That would potentially again disrupt the fabric of this financial system to the core.
@_date: 2015-07-10 18:17:20
Says the man who thinks BTC transactions occur  OFF the blockchain.
Educate yourself fool.
Also, please actually read the response in full before getting back to someone. I was referencing transfers handled by LBC a market who builds in miner fees themselves. As do most every other market in existence. In ALL OF THESE INSTANCES what you are suggesting is literally not possible.

Huh? Care to elaborate on this thought. Would love to know what other universally used ledger you and those other fellas you  spoke of are using to document the coming and going of your coins.
I love learning new things.
@_date: 2015-07-10 18:27:33
Yea. WALLETS do. But how about those pesky places where people buy and sell their BTC?!? What're they again? Oh.....shit. That's right, exchange's.  Exchange's where you dont control a single thing when sending or receiving BTC in regards to miners fees. 
Thanks for clearing that up for me. So that pesky little group of users fucking things up are just a bunch of noobs on the exchanges then?!? In that case screw broad adoption. Ease of use and sensibility. This shit is best left for the needs and twxh savvy looking for some pizza and/or drugs on a Friday night. 
I withdraw my argument. Your ability to problem solve remains stellar.
@_date: 2015-07-09 05:13:14
This is wholly unacceptable as many large orgs and services as well as custom wallets set predetermined and uniformly accepted miner fees and thus remove this ability for many many BTC users. Architecturally this is something that should have been 'taken care of' 2 or 3 iotas ago, bruh.
@_date: 2015-07-09 05:35:34


Do you have any idea how misinformed this sounds? You know what else has ASSURANCES of value due to limited supply?!? Fucking everything in the world because that is the way supply and demand work fool! My goddamned cereal box with the cartoon chocolate Dracula had done this a few times before. They make ONLY X amount of boxes of this 'special' cereal and you know how much more that junk is worth? Nothing. Your argument is null.


Listen I can confirm this. I HAVE BITCOIN ON THE BLOCKCHAIN GOING NOWHERE FOR NEARLY TWO DAYS! Not only has it been a pain in the ass but it's costing my business and effecting my bottom line quite a bit about now. It's like that old, smelly dog you love and loved so much for so long but now it's lost 3of it's legs and its vision is fading. Dog can no longer make it outside to pee and so just goes in the middle of the room. It barks loudly but can't perform even the most basic tasks to stay alive. It's useless. (Before you attempt to argue "I'm not a big trader kn a fancy market" let me stop you. I manage an LBC account that no doubt has seen more USD come from BTC sales the last 6 months than you've earned in a year or more with 99%certainty.
@_date: 2015-07-09 05:09:39
By definition your statement is incorrect.
Definition of EXISTENTIAL. 1: of, relating to, or affirming existence &lt;existential propositions&gt; 2. a: grounded in existence or the exp
Right here? Can confirm this problem exists without a doubt as our coins with our predefined miners fee (percentage of total size of transaction) has been viewed by wek over a hundred peers and has yet to recieve a single confirmation in going in 36 hours any minute now.
The problem is this. Fiat does not inherently have to every worry about an issue such as this. Disrupting it's users and halting select portions of adopters tob transacting with it for indeterminate periods of time. And it won't. You and I can always go out back and conduct business with the physical currency I have in my wallet. 
Currently, with  Bitcoin it has halted a handul of sale and cost me While I have lost sales, time and my own time, which I value quite a bit and all of this hurts my bottom line in more ways than one. I am certainly without doubt far from the only one this has effected. And though it's unnecessary or in case it hasn't been said. 
Can confirm.
This IS a huge problem.
