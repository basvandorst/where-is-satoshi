You bring up some valid arguments. I don't think you should be downvoted for agreeing with OP's father.
1. Of course the rich have a vested interest and would like it to become utilized by more average folks. That would make them richer. There's nothing wrong with that, as bitcoin is worth something because it is useful.
2. I am concerned by what the largest mining groups could be capable of. I often wonder if the network could become its own undoing by placing too much power in the hands of too few people.
3. A huge investor could potentially devalue the bitcoin at cost to himself. From what I've seen, every dip has been followed by a rise and that means people are willing to buy up what other folks divest.
4. I don't think Cowboy_Coder was far off in comparing cryptocurrency technology to other technologies in his post. Sure, it is a logical fallacy to say that. OP said, 


 To me, Cowboy's post was a perfect rebuttal to that claim.

Bitcoin's not like that. Bitcoin won't just love Fiverr for a night and then leave it like all the others. Bitcoin's a compassionate, loving individual who will take the time to invest in their relationship and nurture it for what Bitcoin knows it to be. Bitcoin will stay with Fiverr even if Fiverr grows a little bit heavier, or ages poorly.
Yeah, okay. Notch in bedpost works.

Difficulty is adjusted every 2016 blocks. That means a supercomputer may be able to mine 2016 blocks, but then the difficulty would adjust to approximately stupid high.

Mycelium if you're using an android smart phone. Electrum or Armory are good for desktops. For a savings account, try a paper wallet. Be safe, be careful and learn from the security mistakes of others. Always have backups.

There's a chance you sent it to the wrong address if it hasn't shown up on your wallet right away. I would send a small amount first to test, then follow it up with the correct amount once it shows up.
