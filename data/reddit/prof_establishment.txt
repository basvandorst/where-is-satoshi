What's a "trumper"? I voted for the republican candidate for president. What other prejudice would you like to apply?


Guilt by association? What else do you have?


I fail to see how that does not equally apply to strawman leftists who are against coal power but are for it when it powers their status symbols? Do you deny that the majority of US electricity comes from coal and other fossil sources? Do you somehow argue that converting and transmitting electricity is more efficient than burning it at the source?


I've no reason to assume that stupid people are the minority.


Oh you're going to give me a definition that sets limits on what sources we're allowed to use, or are you just going to segway into more mud slinging?


Oh wow, because you have placed me into a box labeled "kook" you are free from having to elucidate on your own ideas? What a useful tool that is for only seeing one side of the story forever.
Whereas i have reached out to you and tried to understand how you think, you can only screech at me and insist that i must be a witch because of some arbitrary definition.


And i suppose you think yourself above that, which is why you had to go dumpster diving my posting history for any dirt you could cling to? Yes, you are clearly the superman.

To make trillion mark notes? The Treaty of Versailles forced Germany to disarm, make substantial territorial concessions, and pay reparations to certain countries that had formed the Entente powers. In 1921 the total cost of these reparations was assessed at 132 billion marks, about 442 billion dollars in today's money. Between the treaty and the blockade about 800,000 people were starved to death or were preyed upon by people starved out of their minds and the economy was utterly ruined for a period of time. But changes were enacted to national policy and the economy sprang back to the point that it was clear to rival other powers in Europe and abroad.

No scientific fact is indisputable, don't be a fundamentalist. If anything, people doubt that co2 is the cause when sulfur is far worse and emitted far more. Look up Marine Oil. Globalist container ships burn the stuff by tons per mile.


Do you really think they're a threat to anyone? More than the people pushing for kids to take hormones and cut their dicks off, really?

The old shitty republicans. When do you think welfare is going to finally make people self sufficient after the same time period?


Everyone did at one point.


I can't believe you can keep this concept of political propaganda and your "muh russia" narrative in your head at once and they somehow never touch.


Lincoln was a republican.


Liberals since they just can't give up on marxism no matter how many hundreds of millions they starve to death.


Demonstrably false. Marxism is the most amoral doctrine one can ascribe to.

History is but a fable agreed upon. It really depends on who writes it, as always.


I thank you for the compliment. Does it not give you pause to consider that i am not disgusted?


Did they add more to the qualifications for being president other than 35 years of age and being a citizen for more than 14 years? I think it was designed with those loose requirements for a reason, so that political office isn't kept by only certain people.
As for the raving narcissist, you do know that in her new book Hillary blamed more than 40 separate things on her failure to secure the presidency? As for mental disease, you recall when she passed out and had to be hoisted into a van? Is she qualified because she was complacent with her husband's sexual crimes and deviancy which has irreparably tarnished the office of president of the united states?


And i am sorry if my tone comes off as complacent or dismissive because we both know that your opinion is far from unique. Will you assert that it was formed in a vacuum and not at all influenced by what some would call "media propaganda?" Or was it guided? How much of media coverage, late night comedy, and other works revolves around trump these days? I know it saved Colbert from cancellation. Is it possible to have an impartial opinion in all of that? I will not say my opinion is perfect or objective, but i do put a lot of work into doubting myself, for the record.


I didn't say that i said that liberals like to ignore where the "clean electricity" they put into their teslas actually comes from. I firmly believe from my background in engineering and physics that our dependence on oil is largely because of thermodynamic limitations on energy sources and that by happenstance oil has the best EROEI of all options available. Could there also be cronyism? Sure, but they wouldn't have to push very hard, again due to how imposing the laws of thermodynamics are on energy sources. 


I haven't believed in renewable energy for almost a decade now and that was a result of my own scholarly activities. Trump had literally no impact on it. I began to doubt global warming when scientists started acting dogmatic about it, as i would hope anyone who believes in the scientific method would do. Global warming does exist. But i am skeptical that co2 is the cause when the pollution from container ships vastly outnumbers it in every impartial study i have found. 
Marine Oil is also known as Heavy Oil which is the shittiest and dirtiest oil we refine. Container ships burn this fuel as it is also the cheapest fuel that is mass produced. They burn it by tons per mile. Tons per fucking mile. And the sulfur smog they emit is so bad it has sickened countless towns along the shipping routes.
I'd like you to substantiate some of your claims. How is trump a narcissist? How is he a loose cannon? How is he unqualified? I am completely willing to listen, there will never be a moment in my life where i refuse to consider that i am wrong.
