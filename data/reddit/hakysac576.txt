Coinbase is down for me also
@_date: 2019-07-17 14:13:41
Serious question, can someplease offer some advice.
Should I transfer all my ltc into Bitcoin? I have a small amount of btc but have a rather large amount of ltc and I have been thinking if transferring it because I believe more in btc than litecoin but don't know all the facts.... 
What do y'all think? Please be honest
@_date: 2019-07-17 01:36:54
Dam that's a depressing statement
@_date: 2019-07-25 03:34:39
I have 3k in various stocks on Robinhood. Should I cash it all out and dump into Bitcoin? It's the only extra cash I have around to invest and stocks are painfully slow to watch and bitcoin moves so fast I feel like my cash could be better invested. What do y'all think?
@_date: 2019-07-17 14:17:23
So transfer ALL my ltc? Or maybe half?
@_date: 2019-07-11 23:34:47
Are they even reading any forums or just hanging out with super rich investors who research TAs all day
@_date: 2019-07-23 13:54:05
Well said
@_date: 2019-07-11 21:35:38
Do you think any whales patrol this sub and read what us idiots say???
@_date: 2019-07-02 15:09:04
So if a large hack occurs they would refund or insure people who lost coins?
@_date: 2019-07-15 01:31:00
Aye matey
@_date: 2019-07-02 15:41:11
That makes me feel better. Thanks!!
@_date: 2019-07-02 14:47:18
Can anybody speculate the probability of Coinbase being hacked?
@_date: 2019-07-11 23:33:31
I was being serious ha
@_date: 2019-07-25 17:11:49
What is gray scale btc?
@_date: 2019-07-11 23:33:46
Who are the whales? Like super rich Asians?
@_date: 2019-07-17 14:40:24
Good point. I think I'll wait
@_date: 2019-07-17 14:18:46
Exactly! But price is so low... Do u think it will spike before/after the halvening.. Like will it be worth even holding... Is the upside potential worth it?
@_date: 2019-07-28 16:32:44
Thank you for sending me that. Can you elaborate more? I'm still a noob and not really understanding the concept of what grayscale is exactly
@_date: 2019-11-19 15:43:04
Well said
@_date: 2019-11-14 06:04:23
If I were you, I'd do the same
@_date: 2019-11-27 19:02:54
Time is running out to buy it cheap?
@_date: 2019-11-18 18:39:51
A nice little drop
@_date: 2019-11-15 01:29:12
Keep dropping please! I get paid tomrrow
@_date: 2019-11-01 07:00:30
RIP PROPHECY
@_date: 2019-11-28 01:15:45
I'm worried it will end up like litecoin halvening. People in the ltc community said the same thing about ltc going up because of halvening and it obviously didn't do anything. What if that happens with btc?
@_date: 2019-08-08 03:28:21
I wonder how many bitcoin he will buy with that $2billion sold
@_date: 2019-08-27 22:37:54
I was just thinking the same thing. I wonder if we will be here awhile
@_date: 2019-08-28 18:19:43
@_date: 2019-08-29 15:55:45
Just purchased some more today... Btc please Keep dropping so I can buy more after I get my direct deposit tomorrow
@_date: 2019-08-29 05:34:00
How did you 'get hacked'
@_date: 2019-10-14 05:14:03
I check this thread everyday. I may not post... But I'm a faithful reader
@_date: 2019-10-05 15:28:29
Ughhh don't say that bro!
@_date: 2019-08-09 04:16:45
You're a legend
@_date: 2019-06-22 04:43:49
It's been a run of ups and downs that's for sure
@_date: 2019-06-20 06:20:39
I live in Laurel MS and I am shocked that this is real.
@_date: 2019-06-25 16:06:30
Why do you think this?
@_date: 2019-06-23 14:31:15
This is probably a terrible question to ask but what does DCA mean
@_date: 2019-06-17 06:08:10
I agree with you but what if I don't have 9k to buy an only 5k...its still half a bitcoin
@_date: 2019-06-16 23:33:04
I have half of btc. So your comment gives me hope!
@_date: 2019-12-02 22:02:12
Curious, what would you suggest using instead of coinbase? Especially for mobile use.
@_date: 2019-12-13 22:38:45
Interesting. Thanks for the insight!
@_date: 2019-12-14 15:17:50
Out if all the people giving me help in here, this one was the best and it worked! Thank you so much kind sir
@_date: 2019-12-13 21:38:19
Is there anything wrong with leaving my crypto on Coinbase and not sending it to my offline wallet? Is there really a big chance of a breach or hack or government shutdown of coinbaze where I lose my funds or get them hacked?
@_date: 2019-12-13 22:42:20
Also, another question. I cannot figure out adding a new phone for google authenticator.
I just got a new phone and can't get my old Google Authenticator account on there. 
I have the old phone with the current authenticator, but I'm trying to get the same account on to my new phone so I don't have to pull out my old phone every time I want to send/receive. 
Call me dumb or stupid, but I have watched every YouTube video on how to add a new account and still can't figure it out.
Has anyone else had this issue?
@_date: 2019-12-14 15:13:11
Yes! They are so anti coinbase I don't understand why
@_date: 2019-06-30 23:03:50
I hope it keeps dropping in price so I can buy more
@_date: 2019-12-14 00:04:47
I did! And it never gave me option to set up a new account. It only gives me the option to scan a bar code.... But I don't have any barcode to scan.
@_date: 2019-12-14 00:05:35
What if you have a strong password and use Google 2FA
@_date: 2019-12-13 22:43:35
I'm figuring out my ledger, it's kind of confusing and a pain the ass to use. I'm afraid if I transfer 100% over to it, I'll somehow lose my keys / pin to the ledger and now I just lost everything.
@_date: 2019-12-13 22:39:35
 I understand that. Obviously I don't have a lot on Coinbase.... My ratios are not that big. but just curious to some of y'alls opinion.
@_date: 2019-12-01 08:13:48
I think the same thing everyday
@_date: 2019-09-25 17:24:12
LOL at Forbes writing an article about Bitcoin crashing
@_date: 2019-09-24 19:02:03
So frustrating �� oh well.... Time to buy some more while it's low
@_date: 2019-09-18 17:52:34
With the feds printing all this money out, does this directly correlate to inflation with usd?
@_date: 2019-09-04 17:22:05
I just bought a ledger also... Why do you suggest buying a full node now?
@_date: 2019-09-08 03:53:05
Something is a brewing
@_date: 2019-09-24 14:17:04
I've been hoping it drops another 1k
@_date: 2019-09-26 16:01:09
I wish it would stay at 8k for tomorrow when payday hits... Ugh
@_date: 2019-09-18 05:23:41
I purchased about two months ago using wf... Then I switched banks.. I was wondering the same thing. Thanks for clearing that up
@_date: 2019-09-17 15:13:20
Do you have any suggestions on which one exactly to install?
@_date: 2019-09-21 04:23:13
So how many btc is that???
@_date: 2019-09-24 19:53:01
That resonates with me don't worry lol
@_date: 2019-09-24 14:21:30
Thank you for the advice!
@_date: 2019-09-25 17:27:12
Literally my life
@_date: 2019-09-24 14:16:22
I want to buy some so bad right now but I think I should wait until it drops more. Is that a smart move or should I just say fuck it and buy some right now. I'm steadily buying each week but now I have a large sum that I can put towards btc and I'm anxious to wait.... Buy today... Or wait till it drops more? This sub is killing me with all the back and forth predictions I read on here ��
@_date: 2019-09-17 03:32:37
Well said
@_date: 2019-09-24 14:57:01
Very true
@_date: 2019-09-17 15:12:44
I hate to be so dependent but how do you disable coinbase 2FA
@_date: 2019-09-24 18:57:30
Yall this is my fault.. I asked earlier if I should buy and I freaking bought at 9500 and now it does this!!!!! So mad I didn't wait
@_date: 2019-09-24 21:36:15
I also had a bad September lol don't worry
