Not sur 0.01btc would be worth fighting for.
The goal is that the game should resist long enough so that enough people should have time to buy some hint and make the game profitable.
I admit this first shot was kind of easy and blow up faster than I thought, next one should be harder...

You're supposed to solve each part of the game (each riddle) to get the Brainwallet passphrase and take the Bitcoins; as simple as that.

I'll take your suggestions in consideration, nice ideas you have there !

On the free hint page, you can see at what time the last hint has been disclosed by hovering it. 
I'll add a clock counter to be more intuitive !

A few observations to clear things up 
- Clearly, Adrian Paul is in the source :  (but it may not be the source you're looking for)
- There ARE for sure english 7 letters word starting with "wave"
- Problem 3 is solvable, maybe you did not cross check every clues, maybe you have to make a few presumptions to sort things out (like in sudoku...), maybe you'll get some help from hints...
- Probleme 9, why people would'nt have a bit of curiosity, this crypto is level 0 of cryptography...
I've told enough, you should try harder...
