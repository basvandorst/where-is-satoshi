Newcomer question: Does this benefit the network, compared to having a lower hash rate? I know the difficulty keeps increasing so that one block is found every 10 minutes, but is that just to make the miners do more work, or does it help?
Put another way, is it better to have a high hash rate and high difficulty than to have a low hash rate and low difficulty, assuming the same block discovery rate?

It looks like they're in a restaurant, what with the men's and women's washrooms and the box of napkins.

Having a tax from the state is immoral? Or should they just accept various other currencies as well as their own?

So you can never actually duplicate coins?

When a company announces they're doing commercial spaceflights to the moon and accepting bitcoin, that might be more relevant.

Unfortunately the article makes him sound less credible because of it.

You mean $3,000.00? If you're comparing the number of indivisible units available per person, US dollars (or any fiat currency really) offers more of those. But one cent is pretty much worthless, lots of countries have gotten rid of their one-cent coins, and we'd be fine to have the smallest unit worth more than that.

Looks like a really great system!
It would be cool to be able to pay creators who haven't got into bitcoin at all. Maybe the uploader of content accepts donations in bitcoin, then pays that much regular money to the original creators. 
I guess this wouldn't really be a feature of the system, just a way to use it. But it would be cool to see; if I liked a movie I'd much rather support the studio that made it than the people uploading it on BitTorrent.

Careful with that, I hear owning a whole pool is bad for bitcoin.

So maybe what matters is the number of miners, or the total amount of money everyone's willing to invest in mining. Sort of the cost per TH/s times the total hashrate. The more money people are investing, the more it costs to get to over 50% of the total.

If we're being serious this is what to address. If the OP actually got to MtGox from some link and isn't just trolling hilariously, then whoever listed MtGox as an exchange should remove the link.

This doesn't sound good. Combine the term "bit" for μBTC with the existing notion that bitcoins are just data made up by computers and people will think they are literally buying bits of data. They will think their 0.001 BTC or whatever is actually a thousand zeros and ones. 
@_date: 2014-11-21 19:03:35
It's still a lot better than "bits".
@_date: 2014-04-23 20:19:34
Exactly. It's really cool they're offering spaceflights at all though.

How is this affected by the fact that these same coins were seized for illegal activity? I guess it's the same as when cash is seized as drug money, the people who had it don't get to keep it because they got it illegally, but that doesn't make the currency itself illegal.

I don't know if I'm missing something or this whole thing is a joke, but why would you want to mine on other planets?
