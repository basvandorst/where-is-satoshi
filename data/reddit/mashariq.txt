I know, but does not seem likely, to me. Zerocoin is being launched as a new coin now instead of an add on to bitcoin. And I dont know how successful dark wallet would be. In any case, that article was just me thinking out loud. Thanks for reading!

They had it coming.

Never trust any web based wallet. Keep a backup of wallet.dat yourself. You can use truecrypt to encrypt it and then upload it on dropbox. That will provide much better protection than trusting a third party.

Yes you're right. If you just need to hide from your wife then bitcoins are fine. But dont think it is only police who can get that data. I am not sure how much legal protection is there for the purchase information of bitcoins. Online advertisers will def. want to get hands on it and may very well get it. Though it is not clear yet but the skeptic will err on the side of caution.

If a person has bought bitcoins using his bank account and then use those bitcoins to buy porn then there is no anonymity. It is like buying porn and broadcasting it to the whole world. Even worse than buying with the credit card.

I have wrote a step by step explanation of the paper. Hope it will be helpful

Below are the several special scenarios I can think of, but for your ordinary purchases you are better off using a credit card. And for all those people suggesting anonymity as an advantage for buying with bitcoins, they are wrong. Bitcoin is not anonymous.
For all the below scenarios I am assuming the seller is trusted and there is not an issue of fraud.
* Reason 1: It is a service requiring a micropayment, say 5 cents. Bitcoins make these possible and hopefully we will be seeing a lot more like these in the coming days.
* Reason 2: Since bitcoins lower the transaction fees therefore the provider may be offering a much better discount. The fact that bitcoins may go up in value do not hold since you can buy a product with your saved bitcoins and for the dollar amount of the product buy bitcoins.
* Reason 3: Overseas purchase. It will be so much easier to pay with bitcoins and cheaper too.
* Reason 4: To impress a nerdy chick.

It can still be found using the block chain. Don't take my word for it. Look up Matt Green, cryptography expert at Johns Hopkins, who believes the same that bitcoins are not good for privacy.
But if you have bought bitcoins using cash and your identity is not connected then you're safe.

No shortage of suckers in the world.
