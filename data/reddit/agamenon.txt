blockchain functionally EXIST only in BITCOIN, all blockchain are banking wet dreams of bullshit: They try to separate and cut bitcoin technology to get control.
 that dont work in that way... instead, there not a simple solid concept for blockchain... "algoritmic shit", "descentralibullshit database", "redistribuit some shit"... There not a real consensus to blockchain... Bitcoin prevails...
