Localbitcoins is fast and easy. 
Buying you upload your ID and gets automatically verified within 2-3mins. 
 
Once you have done that you can find a seller with good feedback and high trade volume with the best rate and confirm the trade 
Sellers also have different terms so remember to read before confirming the trade but you can cancel if your not happy with the trade. 
Sellers on there are helpful as well 
You can sell by either making your own post or use the quick sell option. 
Loads of different payment options to choose from. 
 Check the website out its really simple and fast to use.

@_date: 2017-12-07 23:14:03
Your coins get held in Localbitcoins escrow and once the buyer has made the payment,  they will hit the “I have paid button” after that you check your account and make sure the funds have been deposited and with the correct name and reference that match up with there Localbitcoins account. Once you have checked everything is correct you click release and the trade has been completed. The buyer will get there bitcoins and you get your money. 
Remember to leave feedback 
If your going to do bank transfer then remember to check that the name matches there Localbitcoins account and not a third parties account.  You can check this when doing the trade
Once you have done your first one you’ll be a pro.

You can setup and offline wallet with electrum 
The wallet has to be setup on a Computer that has never been connected to the internet for it to be “airgapped/cold storage”.

I was referring to the pin code to access the ledger and not as the passphrase. Sorry if I confused anyone. 
When setting up the passphrase it asks you to setup a new pin code  to access that passphrase (Account) 
If you have a passphrase setup then it’s unlikely someone would be able to know what passphrase you used. Treat the passphrase as a 25th extra word/passphrase. They may have all 24 words but to be able to access your account which has your bitcoin on they would need to know the 25th word/passphrase. If you set this up please remember not to forget your passphrase as this is your key to be able to access your funds if you ever need recover your wallet. 
1) 24 Seed + passphrase = Bitcoins (Most secure)
If you do not have a passphrase 
2) 24 Seed = bitcoins (Least secure)

That same line will be said when bitcoin hits $15,000

It’s a never ending line/comment 
Not brushing you so please don’t take it in the wrong way. 
Everyone joins the crypto space at different times so they have no choice to buy at that price.

Strongly recommend using an passphrase which will require you to add an a separate pin code for that passphrase.

The 2 accounts are basically under the same account if that makes sense (under 1 seed)
So your overview will show the full balance but the 2 accounts created will show different amounts
Example 
1 Ledger 
Total funds: 10BTC
Account 1 (his): 5BTC
Account 2 (Hers): 5BTC
The overview on the top right will show everything on the ledger (10BTC) but the accounts will show 5BTC each.
If you want a specific account to receive the funds then you have to open the account up and click on that accounts receiving address for that account to receive the funds (BTC). 
Just a nice way to clean up who has want in 1 ledger and it saves you buying another ledger. 
But remember your overview will show everything but the account balance will show the correct amount in that specific account 
Hope that made sense and help.

Move your coins so you actually have your private keys rather than letting a third party have control over your coins, then you won’t need to worry about account closures.

Benefits of using Segwit:
Faster transactions — Transaction signing runs much faster, especially in accounts with many inputs.
Cheaper transactions — SegWit transactions are counted as smaller and therefore cost less.
Future-ready — For new, second layer applications of SegWit.

Correct, the pin code is just used as a login pin code. 
All you need is your 
24 Seed &amp; Passphrase to recover your funds
But please take time and read the article above to get a better understanding of this advance feature. 
I would recommend anyone enabling this feature to only send a small amount and try recover it via the recover steps to make sure you enabled everything and wrote down your Seed/Passphrase correctly. 
Better safe than sorry. 
Hope this helps.

I have tried to enter your transaction into a bitcoin explorer but no luck (ERROR). Could you go on to your Ledger and click on the transaction itself and on the bottom left you will see a magnifying glass icon and that will open up the block explorer with the correct transaction ID.

Yes I would recommend you either using 
1) [Exodus]( 
2) [Electrum ]( 
Both are simple and safe to use (exodus is user friendly and looks nicer than electrum)
