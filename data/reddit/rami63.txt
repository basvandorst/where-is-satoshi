planning on watching all vids on the weekend. thanks. **I have a question, though**, regarding HODL/Lending bitcoin with interest from borrower, Is there a safe and secure way of lending bitcoins to others vs. "just holding" them in a HW wallet?

I sort of understand SegWit, but I don't understand how LN works (watched several YouTube clips). There is a missing explanation which I am still missing. How can 0 confirmations be sent and re-sent...??? I don't get it.

thanks, but my question was a little different - is there a safe and secure way of lending bitcoins **to others** **(which I don't know and don't-trust)** or not to do so (i.e. not to lend bitcoin to anyone) ? In FIAT if you have some money - you can lend the money to others, thus letting the money "work for you". Was wondering if in bitcoin/smart-crypto-contracts, it's possible too... ?

No need to be rude. Just rasing a flag that the Bitcoin internal Segwit wars might put Bitcoiners in a spot to loose the network effect. If you feel that LC is just a playground for Bitcoin, I might agree - but we both could be wrong in a year's time.

Yes, but that is the least i can do. I cant think of something else... buying more bits will show my support for the move. Regardless of the price at that due date.

does the BTC drops connected to ETH panic selling which brings down every cryptocurrency?

if nobody cares and ppl think its a bad idea - what are the other options? Which full node should I run? where do we stand in terms of the possible chain-split?

I will not be a hostage to jihan and the miners. I run a full segwit ready node. Free Bitcoin!

I am not a coder, nor a day trader. I am a hodler. Just asking from curiosity. It was just a thought from a conversation I had with a friend about math and bitcoin.

For better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, until death do us part - I am a HODLER. Selling before Aug. 1st never crossed my mind.
