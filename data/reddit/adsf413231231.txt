I don't see them earning back 850k btc from trading profits anytime soon :) If some of the theives are tracked down maybe some coins will be recovered. If they are they can be paid to the account holders.. if gox allowed intra-account goxbtc transfers then other people could buy some to speculate on that - although I don't predict much enthusiasm for that to be honest.

I would not be surprised if someone manages to successfully convince some regulator that metacoins shouldn't be subject to existing legislation.. it really doesn't interest me though.. most of the applications people are talking about would be better run on a more conventional title registry system.. metacoins have no real 'value' other than as a subterfuge to confuse regulators (which may well prove useful I admit). If liberty reserve had been run on mastercoin instead of their internal database their accounts would still have been seized.
There's no benefit to the system you propose over mtgox just reopening their website and allowing internal account transfers (other than boosting mastercoin :) - ultimately if mtgox makes back the 850k btc it's still up to them to distribute them to the account holders so it remains an entirely centralized system.

Metacoins are just another word for anonymous bearer shares/instruments.. which are banned in most of the world.. maybe they'll be brought back as 'metacoins' but they're certainly nothing new. There's also no advantage in using a blockchain to maintain the title registry when the assets the entries represent have counterparty risk.. might as well just use a normal registry maintained by that counterparty.

Well the gox site (or gox claims/accounts site) could continue running without enabling trading I guess.. I don't really share your 'gox must die' rhetoric although I would not be surprised if it does die at this point.

sounds like the hacker has access to your email and deleted the withdrawl email?

I really won't. Mastercoin is a solution in search of a problem.. I guess someone thinks it can somehow be a solution to the gox crisis but I don't really see it.. if someone wants to start a charity to raise altcoins to be donated to gox users then fine, but there are probably more worthy causes to support anyway.. either way, why bring mastercoin into it?
