I wonder if new or uneducated users are both more likely to use normal transactions with higher fees.

1.) We simple don't know if segwit, thin blocks or LN will be helpful. The block size limit is artificial and can be lifted at any time. 
2.) The block size limit was created not to prevent spam or DDOS attacks. It was to prevent a miner from creating a huge block and clogging the network.
3.) Moving old coins of high value use to be free.

Simply put Cryptocurrency is a very difficult topic. Dogecoin attempted to make light of things attracting people outside of Speculators, Anarchists, and Computer Scientists.  Doge and say what you might about it attracted the type of people to the space that bitcoin never could. People that never would have gotten into this space, take OP for example, got into it. And I think the community should be grateful for its much silly, very friednly counterpart.

How does linux handle the similar situation?

Cryptocurrency is a difficult space. I don't think we should inaccurately refer to a coin to prevent confusion. Spreading misinformation is the confusion.

Bitcoin layer 1 is not for payments. Use layer 2 for that. We need to stop asking companies to use layer 1 in a way that it's not intended to scale.

What BIP is bitcoin core on?

Thousands of decisions might be a stretch. I think you'd have trouble coming up with hundreds of decisions. Defining them by the only point that is different than others is what I'm doing and not ridiculous.

Bitcoin Core is the philosophy that 1MB is the maximum size for on chain transaction in a block.

Thanks for responding Luke Dashjr. I don't think It is nonsense. I think it reflects reality much more than your answer. Even if it answers it in a certain context of time. Like it or not there are contributes to the Core repository that are not part of Core. Mike Hearn for example, Jeff Garzik. There are also people that have not contributed to the core github, but are none the less part of Core, Samson Mow for example, because they share in the philosophy of 1MB or smaller on chain blocks. And as I'm sure you are aware you are the only reason I am forced to include the and smaller part of it.

Is counterparty decentralized? Does the 10 minutes blocktime target affect counterparty?
