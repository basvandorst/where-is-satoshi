100% correct, I am a retard who got lucky. I am transferring the money out of the site today.
I am planning on getting a Trezor wallet for black friday. I just need to put the money there and HODL.
@_date: 2019-10-28 00:12:00
I dont know about that after watching the second half :)
@_date: 2019-10-28 00:14:34
I was completely numb. This game was not fun to watch!
@_date: 2019-10-28 04:35:31
That is what is looks like what I will be doing. I really can't think of anything else, I am terrified of betting ever again.
@_date: 2019-10-28 01:03:21
Nah the spread was locked in. Brady did not show up as much as I wished but I am EXTREMELY fortunate about the win.
@_date: 2019-10-28 00:11:11
Jeez - I don't have the stomach for this stuff, good for you dude!
@_date: 2019-10-27 16:17:01
thanks dude, I am going to get off the computer now to cool off
@_date: 2019-10-28 03:59:16
we'll see! I am fighting the urge not to bet again, going to take a lot of self control
@_date: 2019-10-27 16:14:35
I believe coinbase has that ability.
@_date: 2019-10-27 17:09:51
nitrogensports...dont make my mistake !!!
@_date: 2019-10-28 01:05:23
Well I wish I asked for it earlier!
@_date: 2019-10-28 00:12:07
@_date: 2019-10-28 00:11:40
Got scared during the game sometimes, but I am freaking lucky thank the lord...
@_date: 2019-10-27 18:27:59
@_date: 2019-10-27 17:17:55
Well the good thing is that I am not convinced I will win, so at least I got that going for me.
@_date: 2019-10-28 03:58:28
I won I am very lucky (and stupid)
@_date: 2019-10-28 00:12:55
Beats me, I only made the account today
@_date: 2019-10-28 01:05:39
Kudos on the win!
@_date: 2019-10-27 17:19:57
please keep those thoughts to yourself
@_date: 2019-10-28 01:07:34
Basically 2:1, I bet 0.525 to get 0.535.
I am returning my original bet and will play with the rest probably, oh my gosh
@_date: 2019-10-28 00:13:16
It would be a loss, PHEW!!!
@_date: 2019-10-28 01:05:59
Extremely lucky and stupid, thanks dude.
@_date: 2019-10-28 00:17:35
I watched it with my family,  scary stuff!
@_date: 2019-10-27 18:29:11
yeah if the pats win by more than 10 then I around double my bet
it was a stupid mistake, but go pats!
@_date: 2019-10-27 17:45:58
I agree I shouldn't be sweating until the second half. The rain is scaring me though...
@_date: 2019-10-29 03:44:42
I ended where I started other than a shit ton of stress over two days. Don't make my mistakes!
@_date: 2019-10-27 17:47:50
Well I hope it goes well for you !!!
@_date: 2019-10-28 00:10:33
It was a stupid bet that paid off, thanks!
@_date: 2019-10-28 04:33:28
Maybe against the Bills I think? It was a close game.
@_date: 2019-10-28 04:34:00
Thanks for the heads up. I will be transferring back to Kraken!
@_date: 2019-10-28 00:16:03
That was a rollercoaster of a game, ohhhh my gosh...
@_date: 2019-10-27 17:46:31
We are in on this together! Gosh I hope we win ;(
@_date: 2019-10-28 18:57:00
never ever ever...I am a stupid man!
@_date: 2019-10-28 03:59:21
@_date: 2019-10-27 18:27:57
@_date: 2019-10-27 17:28:50
thanks :(
@_date: 2019-10-27 18:33:44
I think it is a good bet too, but with the amount of rain we have been getting this could be a messy game, I am feeling OK about it now though.
