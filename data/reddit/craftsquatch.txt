Darn it, wish I was here sooner. My company makes those pillows in the back :D

"Relatively" - it wasn't a best selling item. But I'd say 1 a month, more at Christmas - it was always a Reddit Secret Santa favourite.

Thanks! To be frank, after that surge 4 years ago people stopped buying using their coins. That lack of commercial use concerned me when it was $300, but now at $10k+ I've been proven wrong!

For now I'm keeping Bitcoin as Bitcoin- I think its healthy to circulate it back into the economy. Plus I think for me there's a psychological ease to spending .01BTC over $100, hah.

Just sold my first Bitcoin pillow! Paid for with Bitcoin; it's really happening guys!
@_date: 2013-11-29 16:25:22
We totally do! Send me a note and we can discuss it further :)

Thanks! I'm pretty excited about the new moves in the Bitcoin market, but I'd like to see more folks spending it and not just holding. Seeing that just today I had 5 fraudulent orders through traditional payment platforms- the prospect of a super secure and quick currency is appealing.

Hey thanks! I really appreciate it!

Whats the luxury black friday website?

I just knew I was hitting the right demographic with Bitcoins and geeky pillows :)
@_date: 2013-11-29 17:03:01
Awesome! I just enabled Bitcoin on my [Shopify site]( too! And with a special [addition](
My hope is that with wider adoption of Bitcoin the number of fraudulent orders I get will drop to 0, instead of a handful every week.

I ship worldwide. Shipping for a single pillow is roughly $12 with shipping discounts for multiple pillows. Also, through Tuesday you can use coupon code: TOTHEMOON for 15% off any order :)

Ubuntu and a Tux pillow are on my to-do list, but I should look into the others- Thanks for the suggestions. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 00:15:14
That is incredibly kind of you, thank you for the tip and for the kind words. It's folks like you that make this worthwhile :)
@_date: 2013-11-29 16:27:04
That sounds awesome. My sales aren't quite that high yet, but even when its a few hundred dollars fraud really screws things up :/
@_date: 2013-11-29 17:05:20
Just added the [Bitcoin Pillow]( to my shop :D

As one of the small businesses that made a post- I think its a good thing to highlight the legitimacy of it as a trade-able currency, not just a 'buy and horde' investment thing. At some point I hope people are going to keep aside 'spending bits' more and more  since its a pretty easy and secure way to spend money online.

Yep, they have a way for you to either move it to a wallet or to a direct deposit account for USD.
@_date: 2013-11-30 23:44:38
Thanks! Glad you like them :)

Is this still happening? Does it help to know that I'm a merchant that accepts bitcoin in my shop?
