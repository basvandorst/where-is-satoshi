Austrian theories on time value of money and Interest rates as time preference are brilliant ideas (discoveries imo) that I wish was taken more seriously in modern economics.

Lots of months have been good for crypto, even for people who are not the CEO of Binance. There are plenty of reasons to think that there will be many more good months to come.

It's about architecture. Some things are impossible, like you can't walk through a steal wall to get in to a bank vault. That doesn't mean you can't get in to the bank vault by other means (machinery, social engineering, figuring out the combination, etc)... but none of this changes the fact that you can't physically walk through the wall. 
u/Lexsteel11 has it right. There are some specific ways your bitcoin can be vulnerable but your general hand-waving shows you don't know what you're talking about.
* one law and everyone’s BTC will be worthless as those 1% sell off
* hackers using the BTC chain they can find you with your transactions and steal your BTC
These claims are generalized nonsense. Do some actual thinking.

You should buy a real life bull that you can spray paint a Bitcoin logo on. Keep it by a major highway for advertising purposes.

There's concern fags like you in every one of those threads.
I've been around since 2013. It will go up. It will go down. But every time it crashes the next peak is higher. It's kind of inherent to its nature. It's disruptive new technology, grows with hype and speculation, and is deflationary.
People like you are pissed because you wanted a quick payday. I don't know why you are blaming others for your own choices. You weren't promised anything.
But for anyone else reading, look at how the price has worked in the past. It crashes at continually higher levels. If you can't afford to lose more right now. Take your money and get out. But it's basically just a matter of time until it goes again. It just will probably be a while (my guess is another year in the range of 5000to7000

The top students in the country right now are in classes with professors that write about bitcoin, its uses, its value etc. But hey, if you want take advice on emerging technology from horse boner youtube videos and your grandma go ahead.

It might have been a slight exaggeration. You found a link for the past 60 days. I was looking at some of the papers on this page. Which is like 4or5/10 Bitcoin/block-chain/online assets. [
And if you log in to see the full list on that page a shit ton of the top 100 are block-chain and Bitcoin. I've been researching cybersecurity and interent law/regulation for a paper and Bitcoin and block-chain are literally everywhere.

There are plenty of folks who would try to "hack" (social engineer) a person or use straight up violence to get ahold of 450k worth of  fungible, weightless, pseudonymous loot.

People said the same thing when it was 200 for half a year in 2015. Bitcoin is still being talked about heavily in the academic world. like half of the ssrn top ten downloaded papers are still on cryptocurrency and bitcoin in particular. 
@_date: 2018-11-14 23:24:29
Lol you must be new here.
What had changed about Bitcoin that makes it less valuable? Nothing.
You should have been around in 2015 if you wanted boring/depressing.

Or just ignore the noise and hold.

Organized pump and dumps happen fairly regularly. I've held throughout and done pretty well but I've called a few of them out now... thinking about attempting to catch a sell and buy back opportunity if it goes temporarily nuts again.

It looks to me as though it could go either way once Mtgox comes back online. Is there any reason why the price couldn't come back up once all these people get the opportunity to trade?
I was also wondering if anyone has any guesses as to when Gox could come back.

Thats pretty fucked up. Do you guys think the exchanges themselves are actually stealing though? I don't as of now but I could be naive.

Bitfloor was pretty easy for me so you are not wrong. The money doesn't get to the site immediately, though.
Currency exchanges have been hacked in the past so getting a wallet that you can encrypt and store on your own is much safer than leaving the Bitcoins you buy on the exchange.

1. its a repost of reposts and this iexact image is already on the front page of the sub
2. A bunch of tech stocks grouped together have nothing to do with bitcoin. If you isolate graphs of different data you can find whatever similarities you want to.

Could it also be from an overload of trades? I wouldn't put it past some large organization to do this sort of thing, just trying not to judge it prematurely.
