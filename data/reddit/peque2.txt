At least in the city I'm living (Madrid), Uber is the mafia. Uber drivers don't pay a proffesional public service insurance or any taxes. Uber drivers do not have 1) a legal taxi license (they cost around 120k€-150k€, 2) a professional driver license (it is called BTP license), 3) they haven't pass a very hard professional taxi exam that every legal taxi driver needs to pass. Also Uber taxis are more expensives than normal taxis, so nobody uses them :). At last, drivers who transport people without licenses for money, police can put them a fine between 3000€ to 20000€.
@_date: 2014-08-17 11:02:44
So your problem is that you didn't take the time to print the tickets? I have flown 50 times with them in the last 2 years and I have never had a problem.

I bought a RJ45 cable of 15 meters with bitcoin in amazon via purse.io. 
The order took around 5 hours to be purchased by someone and I received it the next 2 days without any problem. You just have to add the item to the wishlist so the real buyer won't know your address.
The item cost 8.49€, and I got it with a 2% discount made by purseIO.

Bitstamp and kraken. 
Avatarbtc is from spain. They don't have many users and they have 0 liquidity. They require 3 contracts signed and your dni photocopies in color of the both sides. Then you need to ship this information via email and to their postal address signed.
It is a inneficient and nobody use their service, so just open an account in kraken or bitstamp.

Yes. You have just to go to the ATM and insert your phone number. You need a phone number, the sms pin confirmation and the private pin used when selling bitcoins.
