That was... hard to watch.

Why the fuck do people use gaming GPUs for bitcoin mining? Their hash rate is in the megahashes while GPUs that are designed to mine BTC can manage like 10 terahashes.

Bitch you thought

So? Why would you EVER buy a graphics card for the purpose of bitcoin mining? It’s like trying to run a pickup truck with a tiny electric motor the size of a golf ball. 
Even a Gigahash miner [like this one]( will only make you about a couple cents a day, assuming you *don’t* pay for your own electricity. Bitcoin mining with video cards is *pointless*.

How the fuck can you blame entire trends on a single demographic? And how does it solve anything? You can literally blame housing prices on any demographic that is now buying more houses. It’s the opposite of helpful and it’s just divisive for the sake of being divisive.
Your shitty “As a feminist” excuse doesn’t make this logic any less broken.

Surely this is a troll post.

This is the most insipid and ignorant take on modern monetary theory I have ever seen.

... How is the Fed a “private interest”?
@_date: 2019-10-06 23:10:19
... What?
@_date: 2019-10-05 21:23:15


Oof. Looks like someone doesn’t know how money creation works.
@_date: 2019-10-07 03:43:21
Clearly you’re implying we should get rid of the Fed because it’s a “private interest” that “profits” at the “expense” of the public.
@_date: 2019-10-08 00:57:46
Like I said. That’s NOT how money creation works.

*“Private interest means any interest, including but not limited to a financial interest, which pertains to a person or business whereby the person or business would gain a benefit, privilege, exemption or advantage from the action of a state agency or employee that is not available to the general public.”*
The Fed isn’t a business, doesn’t make a profit, and operates pretty much exclusively for the benefit of the public. How tf is it a “private interest”?
@_date: 2019-10-07 00:21:22
Interest isn’t the same as profit.

The fact that it's increasing in value so rapidly means the mainstream is starting to hear about it. Some people have said it may go higher than $50K.

Even a broken twitter account that spams doomsday predictions is right twice a year

Everybody who's focusing on technology has abandoned Bitcoin a long time ago and moved onto ETH / LTC / XMR.
Ethereum for the buzzword-gobbling business nuts, Litecoin for people who want an everyday-carry cryptocurrency, and Monero for money-launderers and privacy fiends.
@_date: 2017-10-21 08:57:45
Yes I know. But this, by all appearances, seems pretty close to no-risk. It's a limited-supply currency with a growing demand. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 04:14:24


XMR. 
@_date: 2017-10-21 04:21:56
Even if it's destined to die, I'm still gonna invest like $20 in it right when it goes on the market.
@_date: 2017-10-21 04:03:08
Did you KEEP the hard drive? 
@_date: 2017-10-21 03:59:19
Does the fact that it went up $400 in one day mean that it's probably about to crash? 
There's NO WAY that this is a no-risk investment, right?
