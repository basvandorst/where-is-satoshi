I'm only seeing 12 right now. Been running for about 3 hours. 12-20 is what I typically see:

The market is exploding. Bitcoin is not designed to be 100% of the market. It does two things very well Decentralization and Security.
@_date: 2017-12-23 19:39:35
Yup, they will have competition in coins. Fiat to coins I don't think will benefit
@_date: 2017-12-23 13:56:05
Why wouldn't you choose monero of another anonymous alt coin?

Imagine this: you send your friend your wallet address so he can some you some btc. He sends it and checks the wallet to validate you received the btc. He sees its confirmed but he can also see every other transaction you've ever made. He can see how much you have and who you've transacted with.

I'll probably use monero or some other anonymous coin. there have been hundreds of alts that already do quick transactions AND offer more. BTC is the base to build from. LN will make it even easier to base line with btc.
@_date: 2017-12-23 20:25:54
Pretty cool. Was pretty easy to test out

LN allows for an easy way to move cross coin. Transactions will be carried out in privacy coins. 
LN is as decentralized as BTC is.
@_date: 2017-12-23 22:12:41
That can all be automated into the wallet. It seems confusing, but the same way open source software exists to manage wallets, there will be open source software for exchanges that utilize the LN. LN is on a whole different level than current bitcoin, bitcoin cash, or VISA

Good chance this will continue. The lightning network will allow for ultra cheap decentralized exchanges between coins. No need for exchanges like Gemini or gdax
@_date: 2017-12-23 14:05:11
I would not recommend coinbase or gdax. They have high fees and have recently been involved in fraudulent activity. Very untrustworthy 
@_date: 2017-12-29 16:16:18
Im looking forward to using the lightning network. High fees do suck, but I believe it's only temporary
@_date: 2017-12-23 21:33:40
The coin itself. Think of it like how currency was backed by gold at first. That is already the current situation. When BTC drops so does everything else(including bcc). 
BTC will stay relevant for the next few years no question. It's the original and its slow moving and secure. With the LN it can support decentralized exchanges that trade cross-coin. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 02:16:56
I don't think there is anything else out there that can handle the # of transactions bitcoin processes and retain decentralization+security.  
@_date: 2017-12-21 04:09:08
Part of the cost of insider trading is loss of trust. It's pretty obvious insider trading happened. Blockchain is all about decentralized trust, so why would a company risk it all? For greed...it happened with Mt. Gox and it can happen with coinbase/gdax.

Supply and demand will determine the fee. The difficulty of mining also changes every two weeks. So hypothetically if demand dropped due to second layer networks. The demand for getting on the block would go down, fees would go down. Then some inneficient miners drop off due to the lower fee. Then after two weeks btc dynamically sets the mining difficulty to account for the lost miners/hashes. That is why a block is mined about every 10 minutes even though the total hash/miner power changes over time.

It's the most popular, by far. This massive influx of users are putting a strain on the network. There are technological innovations being worked on, but bitcoin is a decentralized protocol. Any changes need consensus, which takes time.
 Some groups have created forks of bitcoin, these are changes to the bitcoin protocol that did not receive majority consensus, so they fork/break off from bitcoin to become their own alt coin. What bitcoin does better than these other coins is provide a very decentralized and secure protocol. Some altcoins are fast but centralized. Some are fast but insecure and prone to hacking. There is enough room for many different flavors of cryptos, but be careful. Many of the other cryptos are poorly designed. Bitcoin is the safest but not the best at everything.
Hope that helps :)

If you go to their site they will detail what the fork is going to do. I believe there are different ways to implement segwit, some require a hard fork.

He's attempting to use the most popular crypto at ATH user adoption.  There are numerous techniques being adopted/developed that will solve the transaction fee issue. If you are trying to pay your bills with bitcoin, I'd suggest something else for a few months. If you want to invest in the most stable, decentralized, and secure crypto I'd suggest bitcoin.

1MB block -&gt; 3-7 transactions a second  
2MB block -&gt; about 32 transactions a second  
LN -&gt; 100,000 transactions a second  
The Lightning Network will reduce fees and implement additional functionality. Long term is will do a lot.
Fees are dropping:

When US debt goes up it increases inflation and devalues the dollar. BTC increases in value in relation to the dollar. It's only a small part of the volatility. There are many other important factors than can outweigh the effect

What site was that screenshot taken from??
Melts the heart
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:00:23
Yes but for other reasons. 
If both btc and usd drop in value, but euros stay steady, then btc to usd drops in value at a slower rate  than btc to Euro
That said it's a very complicate system of relationships. I'm no expert.
