Awesome! I just got some generic earpods and now I'm blown away by how simple the whole process was!

Exactly. People seem to think that before FDA was formed everyone just died from poisonous food instantly. I'd expect that type of worldview on but not here

A lot of them still do. In fact over 100 years of FDA and poisoning is number 1 cause of death in the age group from 25-54. Now maybe we should form two more FDAs to hold our hand when we go through the grocery store. 
But that food safety excuse they provide as a reason for their existence is not even the thing that bothers me most. Its the gigantic overreach they exercise in terms of medicine that really pisses me off. Telling terminal patients they can't have certain drugs because they are not approved by them is just a tip of the iceberg

You seemed to know it all. you mind sharing your info?


Then why the hell is it so important to you to convince me how crucial for me the FDA is? You're not even their employee yet you're trying your hardest to convince people how without them we would be eating humans flesh or whatever bullshit you believe in. And then you lose control of yourself and start calling me names when i question your deep faith into some useless government agency. What else do I need besides all the agencies we have in place now? Surely that can't be it.. there's got be a way to fund a few more of them in other areas that will save my life in more. Or.. did we, by any chance, just hit the right amount of regulations? give me a break...

Let's say you're right and it includes everything - including food poisoning. Yet FDA has literally nothing to do with this statistic?
Now why are you so offended that I don't give a shit about FDA and I think its harmful? Why is it so important to you that FDA imposes its regulations on me and companies I do business with? Do you work for them or are you just genuinely concerned about my well being?

They claim they got their data from CDC, but I didn't go verify everything and I didn't go do a random double blind study to make sure everything checks out. For what its worth they don't seem to have any agenda against FDA

Since its creation in 1785 and until the creation of Federal Reserve System in 1913 Dollar did not lose any value. That's backed by historic data and its a fact. 
In the last 42 years it lost 85% of its value (ever since it went fiat).
So dollar used to be a good store of value, but not anymore. 
Please explain me if I am wrong (no sarcasm). I encourage rational debates.

Dollar lost more then 85 percent of its value ever since it went off gold standard in 1971. Are you still convinced its a good store of value?

So which fiat currency has not gone towards zero? Can't think of any that actually increased in value since inception.
@_date: 2013-12-28 22:15:44
So his statement that "every single fiat currency has gone to zero" is technically correct. Every single fiat currency is losing its value and its going towards zero. It doesn't mean its zero already, but it is going towards it.

Which are what? That Bitcoin was design to damage central banking? Maybe this still might be the reason why most bitcoiners are using it today, but it sure will not be the reason for its success. If Bitcion is still going to be around in 5 years it will be because people find it useful and superior to conventional currency's and not because they want to damage anything.

Japanese Yen did not increase in value in last 20 years. In fact it lost value just like any other fiat currency. 
Yen did increase in value comparing to US dollar, but that's only because dollar fell so much in last 20 years.
Exchange rates:
December 1993 -&gt; 1 USD = 110 Yen
December 2013 -&gt; 1 USD = 105 Yen
In the same period dollar experienced more then 60% inflation, while Yen just slightly less then that.
