Um, ok, no I don't get it. Are you saying that limit-orders sold via the order book are not taken into account at all?
Also, are you sure about this, are you familiar with the website in question?

. . . and if there is a shortage of either sellers or buyers, then they will step in and perform that role, using their own stash as a buffer?

Ok. I think I may be getting this finally. But it involves something/someone that you have not mentioned - which is - a 'THIRD PARTY', which in this case is Binance itself. They are in the middle, both taking in and giving out the bitcoins. So, at the end of the hour shown in the screenshot, Binance has taken in 253.89 BTC and given out 412.10 BTC . . . . ?
No, no, wait a minute, what about the OTHER side of the equation, the USDT? I'm starting to see this now. At the end of this hour Binance ends up with less BTC  but they have gained an equivalent value of USDT?
And Binance performs this duty in order to keep things running smoothly, to improve 'liquidity' on their exchange?
Have I got it?

Thanks for taking the time on this. But I'm still not sure. Are you saying there is no flaw in the bar-graph and it's labels, on the screenshot I provided?
Let's look specifically at the label on the 1 hour part ;  it says - **"1 Hour Trades | BOUGHT: 412.10 BTC | SOLD: 253.89 BTC" -** How would you re-label this to make it more understandable?
Also, how is this ratio/information in any way useful? Or is it completely useless?

I'm currently thinking that maybe this bought:sold-ratio-chart is based on 'market orders' only, as it is Binance itself that fulfils such orders (see below)
According to [ . . .
"*A* ***market order*** *is an order to quickly buy or sell at the best available current price. It needs liquidity to be filled, meaning that it is executed* ***based on*** *the* *limit orders* *that were previously placed on the order book. Unlike limit orders, where orders are placed on the order book,* ***market orders are executed instantly*** *at the current market price . . ."*

Just regular old bitcoins.
