You've encouraged me to rull a full node to support Lightning Network.  Are there any hardware requirements/considerations?

How does that work wrt BTC being artificially high because holders cannot sell?  Im paraphrasing what Ive been reading on Twitter from credible sources.
@_date: 2017-08-03 05:27:16
that's pretty clear, thank you.
but is there some amount pent-up BTC supply that will inevitably hit the market that is currently being delayed based on the (lack of) BCC infrastructure? 
@_date: 2017-08-15 23:13:48
trashy and counter-productive, IMO.  id rather have executives get behind crypto, than homeless seagull watchers.
@_date: 2017-08-03 05:28:51
noted, thanks!
@_date: 2017-08-22 14:02:04
by definition, no.  you cannot short sell Bitcoin, because you cannot borrow in Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-24 02:04:56
i suppose you're right, now that i think about it 
@_date: 2017-08-03 05:06:25
very concise, thank you.
Ive also been reading that BTC is artificially high right now because people "cant sell" BTC.  the above scenario doesnt explain that wrt BTC as well, does it?  sounds like it's describing the opposite

Can someone ELI5 this?  What does "new bcash blocks are found" mean, and why does it cause price to drop?
@_date: 2017-08-03 05:44:37
I wonder why these (seemingly legit) talking heads on Twitter are espousing the opposite?
@_date: 2017-08-22 05:56:56
they're not short orders, they are sell orders.  big difference.  they are holders that are selling what they own, not speculators borrowing bitcoin, selling it, then buying it back at a lower price to fulfill the borrowed coins and capturing the difference as profit.

These sports announcers are so fucking stupid.  "Race" is more valuable than Google...yah ok.  Literally a meaningless statement

she is a frightening individual.  she reminds me of a cult member.

They'll still say it's a scam...
You'll be able to prove its not a scam when *they use* Bitcoin to buy their daily food and drink

Shouldnt the lower one be the same basket of groceries year-to-year?  Also, this assumes that the groceries are priced in BTC.
@_date: 2017-09-02 23:42:27
What does that imply about the value/use-case of Litecoin?  
@_date: 2017-09-04 02:00:23
shouldnt that trajectory be reversed?  it implies hodl'ing causes your value to decrease over time.
@_date: 2017-09-09 14:16:12
what a horribly and unprofessionally written article. 
@_date: 2017-09-05 14:44:08
Misleading title.
@_date: 2017-09-14 14:19:31
i love this so much.
@_date: 2017-09-29 01:52:54
No I didn’t miss the bigger point (which was actually directly stated), I’m saying the delivery of it totally invalided the point. Dude sounded like a dolt

The number of times Schiller says "somehow" in his description of Bitcoin tells me he has no idea what he's talking about.

Their investment advisor started mentioning it.  They required multiple trusted sources of interest.
@_date: 2017-10-22 22:22:18
Really horrible documentary.  The only Bitcoin exposure is in the title itself, terribly uncompelling documentary 
@_date: 2017-10-14 17:02:46
Noted!  As others stated, I would love to see the code when it's available 
@_date: 2017-10-01 07:46:34
How exactly did you pay?  What app?

I dont think it is a coincidence that the biggest proponent of crypto inside major US banks is a female...
Buttresses the research of the plasticity and adaptability of female CEOs and leaders over their male counterparts.

As I understand it, Litecoin is similar to Bitcoin aside from the following:
Bitcoin uses Shah-256, Litecoin uses Scrypt;
Bitcoin mean block time is 10 minutes, Litecoin is 2.5;

no it's not...the highest point is above the H and the lowest point is above the L

this is honestly more of a bad sign than anything else.  McAfee is absolutely nuts and a liar.
