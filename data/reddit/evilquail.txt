Ok that's a reasonable definition of violence that I'm willing to roll with. It can be taken to include incarceration which I assume is what you're referring to in your above points.
So here's my thinking - let's say there's a law that you think violates your rights. Now lets also say there's a bunch of people who believe that the *lack* of that law would violate their human rights in some other way.
Now you think they're wrong but hey, that's what they think. So if these people are in the majority then this law would presumably be enacted.
This issue is non-trivial because on any given law your almost always going to have the scenario to some degree, so *someone* will invariably feel that their rights are being violated because the majority of had an opinion that was wrong.
My feeling is that if these people seriously consider this right to be important to them, they should be free to leave the jurisdiction of this law WITHOUT being impacted by this law on their way out, but they should *not* be free to continue live within the jurisdiction of the law while ignoring it, for this is effectively enforcing a violation of rights upon people who perceived the presence of the law to be necessary for the rights.

Close, but I see it as "Don't want taxes? Go ahead and move somewhere that doesn't have taxes, but don't go mooching off the infrastructure *here* that's been payed for by the rest of us that voted for high taxes."

Sorry, I'm confused as to your point about the violence. Are you implying that the majority of people *actually* support violence from the state, or is this hypothetical?
And to be clear, when you say violence what do you mean?
@_date: 2015-03-28 07:28:17
I think that every has to make choices and compromises, and that if there's a law (or lack of one) that I don't like, but don't consider significant enough to prompt my moving then I shouldn't get to pick and choose, lest my choices violate the perceived freedoms of others.
As an example, I think the speed limits on our highways are outdated and perhaps not even necessary at all in some circumstances. But I don't think I have the right to travel at any speed I want because the majority of people still believe that the speed limits are correct. They're wrong, but I'd be infringing on their perceived rights to ignore them.
I think where this breaks down is when people *wish* to move but can't (perhaps due to a lack of funds), and I think that the solution to this is that governments who truly value the freedom of their citizens should provide effective methods for them to leave.
EDIT: I'm gonna go now so I probably won't be able to reply to your response to this comment. Thanks for the discussion though, I've really enjoyed thinking through your points. :)

"Taxes aren't the problem here"
Sorry I thought this was all about the taxes?
@_date: 2015-03-28 01:38:34
Did you actually read the article? The intention is to tax *the banks* 5 cents on every 100 dollars and lock that money away so that if a bank collapses, it can be bailed out on its own money rather than through taxpayer money originally allocated for other purposes.
Sure there's issues of whether that tax will be passed on consumers (it likely will be, but keep in mind the only people incurring a significant cost will be those with enough savings to make large amounts of interest of their deposits), but I think we can agree that the idea of forcing the banks to have some sort of accountability for their actions isn't exactly "morally reprehensible".

Undoubtably. Just leave me alone in a different country please... Sure Aussies complain a lot, but right now I'm happy to let us do our thing here, and you can do your libertarian thing... not here (assuming you can find enough people to agree with you and join in).
Well actually if you happen to be in Australia and can get enough people to vote in zero-tax laws, then so be it.
@_date: 2015-03-28 06:32:38
What do you mean nowhere doesn't have taxes? 
Sort this list by personal tax:
There's about a dozen of them, many of them quite nice places to live if you're well off.
@_date: 2015-03-28 03:37:37
Meh. Each to their own.
@_date: 2015-03-28 06:25:23
If that violation was agreed on by the majority of the population, that would be the libertarian thing to do.

If you think a tax on people with significant assets is robbery then you're missing the nuances of how an economy runs.
@_date: 2015-03-28 02:54:22
You seem reasonable.
@_date: 2015-03-28 03:01:33
Thanks for the insight. I'd be interested to see if you have any thoughts on a potential alternative method of insuring these banks? Or do we just assume that the chance of large scale collapse in Australia is sufficiently low that it's worth just taking the risk of bailing out the banks (or not) if the time comes?
@_date: 2015-03-28 02:45:46
Yeah agreed. I think the issue is however that *any* method that forces banks to secure against future loses in some way is likely to result in a cost to the bank, which will invariably be passed on to consumers.
You can make some progress in legislating to prevent banks from taking on bad debt, be the reality of the situation is that it's effectively impossible to guarantee against *all* risk (even prudent borrowers with genuinely low credit risk can default on loans if something terrible happens to the market), which is what this law is trying to protect against.
@_date: 2015-03-28 02:53:25
Part of what makes this law (potentially) effective is the Australia's significantly higher interest rate in comparison to countries like the US.
I can see where you're coming from on the passing on of costs though - it's very much a pragmatic law in that it doesn't really force the banks to change their behaviour, even though it does offer some protect against adverse outcomes while reducing the exposure of the Australian public.
One thing to remember is that in Aus banks can secure loans against both a mortgage and a borrower's other assets, meaning that risk exposure is reduced slightly compared to the USA where if a house drops in value massively that's that.

Well I certainly hope the majority doesn't think violence is the appropriate response.
EDIT: There are plenty of countries that offer 0% personal tax rates. Instead of constructing a strawman of a population voting for what would honestly be a violation of human rights, why not move to one of those countries if you consider the issue to be that important?
@_date: 2015-03-28 03:29:21
Hang on, right now you're saying tax=theft... are you advocating for a zero tax society?
@_date: 2013-04-13 04:12:17
If these things are so effective wouldn't it be better value for BFL to take out a loan from a bank and run the machines to mine for themselves rather than sell them?
I'm no expert but it seems like a poor buisness model to sell something that is worth significantly more money in the long run than what it's sold for?
@_date: 2013-04-13 04:49:06
Hmmm, good point about not being able to get a loan for such a proposal. I'd imagine they still had to raise some capital at some point, though it would be easier to get a bank on board with the idea of selling a product to other people, even if that product does create imaginary internet money.
I was never suggesting that they should keep any preordered products to themselves, but that being said, once they've fullfilled their initial selling obligations do you reckon they'll start just making machines for themselves?
