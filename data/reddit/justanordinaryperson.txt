Oh. But isn't it that the higher priority transaction will be propagated first? So, if I do a really big spend with another transaction, it might end up getting a higher priority? How do you mitigate that?

Retarget works both ways. It will reduce the difficulty in that case.

How do you mitigate the effect of trying to spend what you don't have (until it is accepted by the network -- which I assume takes time and the customer would not want to wait for that amount of time)?
Sorry, noob at understanding the bitcoin protocol here so ignore me if this is a very stupid question.

To be completely fair, it is really hard to make anything "GPU"/"ASIC" resistant. Eventually, HW will catch up, either on its own or with a combo of HW/SW.

Thank you for explaining this. There is so much incorrect information in this thread that it is super annoying.

Most systems like these have remote CPU/GPU/memory monitors installed. The fact that the utilization would drop when a person logs in would probably be very easy to correlate.

Oh, I see! You were right! I didn't know they were two separate things.
Sorry to bite your brains off, but another follow up question. So, I am assuming the way bitcoin-core stops you from double spending is that every single node maintains a list of all the addresses and they amount of bitcoin they currently have, correct? And if any transaction that causes the amount of bitcoins to go negative, the transaction will not be propagated?
