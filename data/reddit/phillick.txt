You had BTC with coinbase when the hard fork happened. They are just letting you access it now.
If you had your BTC in a wallet that you controlled, you would have access to it before. 
In a way coinbase did you a favor because BCH is worth 10x now than at the time of the fork
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:10:08
It probably is... To be fair, it is good business for them. Opening BCH trading just gives them so much money in fees.
Segwit is much harder to monetize quickly. They are a business after all
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:04:30
Probably a stop loss... LOL

It is not about defending, as I am not and never intend to be their costumer, but about showing my opinion that not every business is willing to follow the vision of the Core developers and Bitcoin has to be able to function without them having to.
Bitcoin has to be able to servive greedy (or simply stubborn adversaries). When I think about coinbase, I think about Comcast, not SpaceX. There is nothing visionary about them, they are just greedy. Bitcoin's threat model has to be able to handle greedy.

If lightning is going to scale bitcoin, making it useful to billions, there is no way everyone will run their own node. No way.
That means 99% of lightning channels will be administred by third parties that will supply and handle your connection to the network, killing any descentralization (Just like having your money in a coinbase wallet).
Of course that would only apply if you want to receive money through lightning. If you want to send it, you will be connected, so it should not be an issue.  But your channel would be dead as soon as you go offline.
It is cumbersome. I trust the devs that there may be a clever solution to having a trustless two way lightning channel that doesn't require being online 24/7 to receive payments, but right now there isn't one. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:56:21
Awesome! Thanks for the clarification.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:02:54
It is probably because coinbase is launching BCH Trading so everything is crazy right now.
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:43:45
It would be interesting to see how that is being implemented. If you would have at least a few days to do that, I don't think it will be a problem. Just don't like the Idea of having to run a server to be able to use lightning in a safe way.
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:19:13
Awesome! I hope that soon we will also see third party watchers enabling the common folk to use lightning. If I understand correctly you would have to be connected 24/7 to the blockchain to avoid the other party in your channel to close it in an unfavorable state to you. 
It is not a problem if you are paying someone (since the state is always favorable to you) but it is a problem if you are receiving money. Third party watchers would allow you to be relatively safe without having to run your on lightning node.

Apple has the source code, ways to sign the software and make it legit. The FBI wouldn't have that. The FBI would have to do it through exploits

The people trying to implement the ligthning network are aiming for interoperability so there should be only one lightning network.
The problem is your personal channel has to be done with a specific party (like today you have a bank account). If someone wants to run a business out of provinding lightning channels, it is quite possible that eventually they would need to follow KYC laws.
The thing is, since the ligthning network is completly trustless, there is nothing stopping a 100% anonymous person with a lot of bitcoin to rent servers and just start accepting lightning channels and collecting fees. There should be no risk for you.
As long as no bank accounts are directly tied to the business, enforcing KYC laws is really hard.

I think It makes sense. They run a business... They have a responsibility to their costumers to provide the best possible service. Following the hashrate makes sense for now. 
I am not saying that I agree (I really don't have a solid opinion regarding who is right in the 2x debate), but you really can't blame them for following the hashrate
@_date: 2017-08-25 20:15:22
did you use blockchain.info?
You probably should try there first
@_date: 2017-08-31 21:18:07
Yup, just variance
@_date: 2017-08-05 19:28:45
How do you realize your profits If you don't sell? Buy low, sell high and that kind of stuff. If you are willing to keep your bitcoins in an exchange there are ways to both maintain your BTC portfolio and have some profit in fiat
@_date: 2017-08-26 11:06:41
This is saying that wallet is empty. I don't think you are going to get any money from there.
@_date: 2017-08-25 20:04:02
I understand your point... but for bitpay, the benefits of immediately reducing fees with de 2X increase and staying with the majority of hashrate should probably be higher than maybe losing the core devs.
They are just more practical. Between being hostage of the miners and of the core devs, bitpay chose the former.
I know you can't put a price in good quality code, but they probably think the risk of bitcoin dying because no good devs will write good code after 2X is lower than the risk of staying in the chain with very low hash power and possibly lower business adoption.
It's just being pragmatic, managing risk and thinking business first. Miners and big business will always do that.

Coinbase screwed up. Given the state of the mempool, shouldn't have been that much
@_date: 2017-08-31 21:08:26
It is mostly random, but recently the hashing power has been split with the bitcoin fork, BCH. For now the situation seems to have settled tough, so what you saw was probably just variance

A lot of people care... A lot.
You can't say he isn't being profitable If you don't know his costs. What If he doesn't pay for electricity?
@_date: 2017-09-02 15:35:51
What fee did you pay?
Depending on the fee and current state of the mempool it is possible your transaction will never confirm and you will get access to your money in a few days.
Recently the mempool has been really empty so the transaction go through soon. 
@_date: 2017-09-01 00:53:47
The only logical reason is that they wallets from exchanges overpay fees so that the funds in their hot wallets are not locked waiting confirmations. 
Since your are the one paying, they set the fees higher so that your receive your money quickly and they don't have their hot wallet locked up.
Of course there are also the personal wallets with funky feed estimation algorithms and no way to manually set fees that make people pay way more than reasonable.
@_date: 2017-09-01 09:50:11
The old blocksize limit was 1000000 bytes. 
Anything above that means that they changed their config.
@_date: 2017-09-02 16:31:57
Yes. The blockchain has no record of the 500 transaction only of the 2 transactions opening and closing the channel.
@_date: 2017-09-01 20:09:57
Did they send your money in three parts? If they did, this is way more expensive than just send you money through one transaction.
They also set a very high fee, wich was completly unecessary. Coinbase messed up with fees. Happens a lot.
@_date: 2017-09-06 09:31:52
It is, if there is no crash. You would be betting that bitcoin will go up. It is not a sure thing.
@_date: 2017-09-05 19:56:31
But the ammount of disk space required will be limited by the blocksize, which of course will limite the number of on chain transactions per block.
The problem is the blockchain will become premium space with high fees. 
Everybody will be able to run a node but without a blocksize limit, not everybody will be able to use the blockchain. I don't think we need a blocksize increase now, but it will be needed in the future (a dynamic increase solution would be even better)
@_date: 2018-03-12 20:17:50
This is a nice opportunity to send your coins to a wallet you control. 
I don't know anything about bitcointalk fees, but you really should think about sending your coins from binance to a wallet you control (if you are not actively trading them). 
The fees are cheap right now, so it shouldn't be that expensive.
@_date: 2017-09-01 09:48:43
Just saw that!
Now just BTC.TOP and ViaBTC left out of the biggest miners.
With Antpool changing, should be just a matter of time.

Yeah, i don't think the NSA created the malware. They created the exploit that allowed this malware to propagate so quickly and efficiently, but they probably used it to spy on foreign (and domestic) entities or to launch an attack against critical infrastructure. They certainly didn't use it to shut down hospitals for a few bucks worth of bitcoin.

That's it guys... P=NP. Another Millenium Prize in the bag.
@_date: 2017-06-07 23:27:48
But If you paid with cash, maybe the bitcoin is worth more now? If you held it of course.
