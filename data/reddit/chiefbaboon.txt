It might just trash BTC itself.

Bots that have big pockets, run by wall st speculants buying and selling from each other, adjusting the price to wherever they are programmed so all the morons will follow and trade at that price so they can buy up cheap. This is not a conspiracy theory, but a wake-up call. It works as long as there are enough suckers wanting to sell :P

Let me rate Weiss Ratings: F for failed as shitty self-proclaimed shit. Anything else?

No. Due to greedy fooks, called mining centers allowing for optimizations only AFTER BTC has lost a lot of credibility due to their greed. Sad to admit but BCH is closer to what Bitcoin is supposed to be. LN + Segwit weaken BTC's security and put control into the hands of centralized 'hubs'. Take a guess who will control them. The point is centralization, they are undoing what BTC represents (decentralization and POW) and grabbing BTC by the neck :(

Hehe.. I think we need one that says 'My bitcoin is bigger'

It will go down to 1K. 1 K Grams. In GOLD.

And this only crossed your mind now? When did banksters ever do something without the intention being to further fill their pockets? Seriously?
@_date: 2018-01-23 07:29:53
What's your problem, will you be moaning in 2 months when BTC is at 40k as well? If so let me buy them off you real quick so you don't suffer.

Yeah mate. I reached it many months ago :) It only gets worse from here, you'll start trading with your mind and make some nice profits. Buy the dips.

You get an upvote

He and those bashing crypto understand it better than most people here. Only they're bashing it to keep it low so they can buy into it cheaper. Food for thought. ALWAYS watch what they do, not what they say..

I was afraid putting a question mark at the end of my original sentence would look like that would be asking. You got me on this one!

This is not a correction. It's a trap. Not the music kind of.

HODLing is when your hands are getting tired of the bags.
Investing is NOT HODLing. Trading is NOT HODLing.
HODLing is stupid.

Cool, he's denying but continues selling &amp; killing crypto. Or it's not him. Or it is. He denies. All is well then!

Hey can I be a fake satoshi too? It looks like a new profession to me. Just like the Elvis imitators. Someone started that too, right? Now look around..
@_date: 2018-03-18 20:34:22
Honestly. Who gives a fook what the prices r doing? :P
