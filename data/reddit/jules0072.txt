This is the bottom line to the hosted versus on-site debate. Few organizations can afford the infrastructure to provide the most secure environment possible - from both a capital expense and operating cost perspective. Especially when considering enterprise level, scalable systems.
Oh god I cannot believe I stepped in this. Let the down voting begin :/

Just because Bryne gas embraces bitcoin does not mean by any stretch of the imagination that overstock is a progressive or forward thinking company. Bryne himself isn't even progressive or forward thinking. He dabbles in fringe politics and has been known to berate the state's residents just to forward his agenda. He seems to have quieted down In the past year, but for a while there he was a distraction on a few items including education and fire arms. I've known people who worked at overstock. It's just a company.

Marketer here. Concepts aren't intrinsically valuable, you are not don draper. 
What you are describing is aspirational selling. It assumes things about your target audience which are not true. The bitcoin process is, in and of itself, not going to appeal to mainstream consumers. I don't care how many ads with Aaron Paul on a Lamborghini you create.
