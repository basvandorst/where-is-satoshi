Paper wallet is the best way next to hardware wallet. They're also basically free. [Here's a tutorial]( on how to do it the right way

Thanks a lot. I appreciate it

@_date: 2017-12-04 21:16:36
Ha ok. Guess it was just bs. Id love to ask you something else though. How much would it cost to have a tax accountant with crypto experience do my taxes? Ive only ever used turbotax by myself, but I think this year I want to consult a pro
@_date: 2017-12-04 21:05:26
Ah ok. I have heard the idea of starting your own trading business in an effort to reduce taxes. I am not sure how or if it works, I have just heard the idea floated around
@_date: 2017-12-03 14:23:41
On the bright side, you learned to never make this mistake again!

The other day on Gdax I got an error and when I refreshed, I was looking at someone else's account. I could see all of their orders
@_date: 2017-12-06 14:37:33
I know right. That's why I gave up on alts. Too complicated to keep track of. Just stick to the one true coin now

When you sell or buy another coin. Buying btc itself is not a taxable event

When I play Rocket League, I start each match with "good luck have fun buy bitcoin". The typical response I get is "Yea dude I'm hodlin' _ bitcoin here" to which I reply "do not broadcast that!". Granted, most of them are probably inflating their number, but they blurt it out without even thinking
@_date: 2018-05-05 16:15:45
Ha, no, I'm serious. I'm just trying to buy some kratom from a legitimate online vendor. They stopped credit card payments temporarily for some reason. Thanks for the info though.
@_date: 2018-05-07 00:07:08
Ok just to be clear here, I am not trying to buy illegal drugs on the darknet. No sarcasm or wink wink nudge nudge. I am trying to buy a legal product from a legitimate website whose credit card processing is temporarily down
@_date: 2018-05-02 15:03:21
I'd prefer to look at it as throwing a ton of shit against the wall and this one luckily stuck

Shit. That's really gonna mess up my notebook I've been using to track my buys and sells. Thanks though. I'll look into this
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:47:06
Maybe to keep an eye on when they finally do sell? Not sure. I want to know how they know whether to apply short term or long term capital gains. How do they know if I just sold 2 year old coin from my ledger or 2 hour old coin I just bought on gdax?

So lets just say I keep my BTC on my ledger. Fork happens and I send them to GDAX. Once they arrive in GDAX, B2X will appear in my GDAX B2X wallet. Is it that easy?
@_date: 2017-11-18 17:52:34
Think he means just simply buying weekly. Honestly, I'd use limit orders at $75 intervals down
@_date: 2017-11-25 21:07:53
Yea, trading .2 or .3 at time will make you a lot more than .01. However, a good trade is a good trade. Keep trading with that small stack until you're consistently making profitable trades. By the time you invest more into a larger stack, you'll have the skills. I only use limit orders. On GDAX there is no fee whatsoever for limit orders. So, tx costs don't eat into anything.
@_date: 2017-11-25 20:22:52
I knew nothing about trading 2 months ago and I have been profitable everyday. Some more so than others

For long term storage, $2 is nothing, but if you're daytrading, $2 for 50 is ridiculous. You'd never make any money. Why don't you like having money on an exchange?

Gdax is the only site you need
@_date: 2017-11-25 23:04:52
Pretty much. Wait to see where it settles down after reaching ath and just start the process over. If it looks like a breakout is about to happen, I'll cancel my sell and set it higher. Maybe 120 above instead of 75
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:14:18
There was a 520 sell wall earlier today too on GDAX. I think that's the highest Ive ever seen

Oops. Huge typo. Meant NOT convinced. I love the volatility. I scalp all day long.

Set buys at 100 intervals on the way down

I hear ya, buddy. My personal opinion would be some type of user error. I feel like there a lot of people in crypto that have not properly educated themselves before getting into all of this. I'm not saying I'm a know it all, faaar from it. But I've seen plenty of people worrying that if their wallet somehow physically broke, all their coins would be gone. This just shows a complete lack of understanding of how the tech actually works. If people are confused about this simple concept, it's likely they've already made some kind of mistake in how they handle their coins.

Depends how old he is. If he really is a kid (late teens/early 20s) he'd have time to make it back if he loses it all. If the dude's in his 30s, that's an insane risk

Bitcoin is fascinating in itself, but the fact that it's creator remains anonymous is mind blowing. My friends and family ask "you trust that? its not backed by anything.". I always say let them know nobody knows who created it either.

If your coins are on coinbase, get them off of there and onto a paper wallet. When they are on CB, you don't possess the private key. CB does. This kinda means your coins don't belong to you 100%. Youre also leaving all the security up to CB. A paper wallet is one of the safest and it is THE cheapest way to store your BTC. Its literally a piece of paper with a public address that you can share, and a private key that you put away in a very safe place. Here's a better explanation and a video tutorial: 
@_date: 2017-09-18 02:12:50

On Coinbase, it says if you do this it's lost forever

I thought it went over 5? 5021 or something like that

You literally go into your btc wallet on coinbase and hit send then type in the address of your other wallet

Yes, it's reliable and safe, but you don't want to leave your coins on there long term. Here's the best tutorial I've found for creating a paper wallet.
