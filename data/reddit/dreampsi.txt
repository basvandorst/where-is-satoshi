I remember the flash crash for 1 second down to what....$.10 I think it was. Many people became instant millionaires in 1 second because it jumped right back to where it was. Some guy market sold a lot was the reason I read. People that had limit sells were triggered all the way down. That has to be the most.

because institutional investors need high volume and secure storage with some type of insurance. Coinbase is aware that the ETF is going to go through (my opinion) whether now or later as they have stated that during "dips", they like to prepare for the "bull runs" with new upgrades. They have Coinbase Pro with new ways for institutional investors to sink big $$ with wallets to handle those types of amounts. Min. price looks to be $200,000 per share right now so the ETF will give them the insurance and security they need to enter in and drop their wad.

yup, that could work, too. 
Based on what I read about Bakkt, they will have their own "digital warehouse" in which they move around BTC they already have in their vaults which will make transactions super fast since they don't broadcast to the network right then. So, they may do a hybrid of what you propose with you paying what you want and it goes to your Bakkt account and makes the transfer from your fiat to BTC they have in "the warehouse" or some version of that. Whatever it will be, they will have their own wallet/software for it.
@_date: 2018-08-05 02:11:32
just a simple conversion. A cup of coffee is $3.99. You open your BTC wallet and pay $3.99 which will equal .00058 BTC (what it was at the time of this post).
 A month from now a cup of coffee is $3.99. You'll open your wallet and pay $3.99 which is .000499 BTC(I used $8000 USD as a price base)
You'll pay whatever fixed dollar amount an item is but it will take the BTC that = that $amount at the price BTC is at that time. There  are companies who accept BTC that they will put into a wallet for themselves and sell when they want and there are companies that do the conversion on the spot to your fiat so they don't lose any $$ if the price drops.

well, when BTC goes up, you don't spend as much. @ $19,999 price for BTC you would spend .0002 BTC = $3.99

from the articles/blog I read on their site, they will buy the BTC and keep it in a hot wallet type vault where a client purchases it from *them* and not place an order that they then go and fill. I doubt they get the keys but until there is more info, that is all I have read.

There is Coinbase and then there is their exchange side, Coinbase Pro (formerly GDAX).  When you buy from either one, your BTC is put into a wallet that was created with your account. You don't need another wallet but for safeguards against theft, look into a Trezor or Ledger hardware wallet. I am not sure you can any profit to a credit card but you can link a bank account and send it there. Depending on how much "profit" you have...check the fees to transfer and how many days it takes (usually takes 1-3 days for me to transfer to bank). If you planning on day trading, make sure you are using limit orders on CBPro, there are no fees (market orders have fees)

@_date: 2018-06-24 17:42:10
well not exactly...
While I did spend more than I could afford at the time, it turned out in my favor and I made a nice profit but like everyone else, have seen it dwindle away, unrealized, of course. I was going to use my profit to pay off my home mortgage and ease up my finances to the point I could change jobs and find something for less pay that I enjoy a heck of a lot more! So, after I finally made the decision, before I could get home it started tanking and has been in this free-fall for a while so any restlessness is because I am still stuck at my crappy job and still have a mortgage payment. Just been waiting to see that spike to get me back to where I need to be. 
...but you are right, it does affect your health. Heck it goes back to December numbers before the end of the year, I will be able to retire very early. Thanks, mate

if you mean like a Ledger Nano, then let's say you bought on an exchange...then you'd get the BTC address on your Ledger and send the BTC from the exchange to that address. Now you have your BTC because you have the private keys to it on the Ledger Nano. When you are ready to sell, you use a wallet interface, called Ledger Live (in this case) and send the BTC from that address to whoever you are paying. Your Ledger then asks you to verify the tx by pressing 2 buttons simultaneously and then it will send it. No Ledger to okay tx. means no one can send from that wallet.

Amazon is going to announce using BTC (as seen late last year rumors) late summer this year. They are purchasing BTC before the announcement so when they announce and it skyrockets like never before they got their share that will equal trillions. Poo-poo if you like but I'm usually 75%+ accurate. Announcement end of July with implementation in Spring 2019.

BAHAHAHAHA! Oh, the naivetah. 
@_date: 2018-02-17 20:52:06
the way I personally do it is I buy with a credit card on Coinbase and get it instantly (bank transactions takes several days..your price is locked in but you don't get the BTC at that time). I then go to GDAX and use their transfer feature to pull it from Coinbase side to the GDAX exchange side. I day trade so if I want to sell BTC I sell it under the LIMIT (not MARKET) sell. Research Taker vs. Maker. If you place an immediate buy or sell at the market price you pay tx fees. If you use Limit, you do not. Say if you want to sell at $1000, use Limit and sell it at 1000.02 and you pay no tx fee. When I'm up a K, I then transfer it from my USD account on GDAX back to my bank account. I use a cc because I get points :)
@_date: 2018-02-16 03:42:15
I input all mine in to an app you can download called Blockfolio. On Coinbase's site, go into TOOLS and then HISTORY and it will show you the date, how much you bought and what the price was when you bought it. They also have an export report. For taxes, I used bitcoin.tax and downloaded a report that you can upload to that program and it will sort it all for you as far as each transaction. Some tiers only allow so many tx but the top one allows unlimited txs.

When they got enough cash, they'd quit. smh

once you sell your bitcoin (say for more than you bought it for) and elect to put that money back in your checking account, it takes 4 days for the funds to be deposited. At least that is what it has taken each time I've done it. I think once it was 5 days and they had a notice that they were behind/slow or something like that. degraded service, maybe? You can also do a wire transfer which used to be $25 (have not looked in a while) and I think that takes 24 hours.

@_date: 2018-07-18 17:21:52
most are in the 10-20% range but this is reasonable due to the costs associated with it. 
The owner has to pay for advertising, the rental space to place the ATM, buy local and state licenses which cost $500-1000+ depending on location, capital gains taxes because they are buying/selling from their wallet to you, depending on the machine they must pay a collection service to remove and deposit the cash, they must have a dedicated compliance officer and pay for any breakdown issues to have it serviced, pay for wire transfer fees to the exchange so they don't have to wait 5-7 days for the BTC they bought to show up in the wallet...so in the end, the owner might walk away with 1-5% and that is if he buys/sells from the exchange. If they own a "hot wallet" that buys/sells instantly on-site and the price they bought BTC at has lost $1000 in value, they've lost that money but obviously they can gain if a bull run is in effect over what they purchased it at. 
@_date: 2018-07-31 06:13:12
When it was around 48% last year in Oct. the price over the month was around $4,400-$6,100. About to explode again and surpass the ATH. I predict (man, did I just say that lol) $25K.

probably not buying just yet. Probably getting any paperwork filed and account opened with CPro and awaiting insider info on the SEC deal to make whatever move they are going to do.

Most commentators believe that the latest ETF application will be approved due to how the ETF is structured. Average retail investors simply don’t have nearly $200k lying around to invest in Bitcoin. This means that the SEC’s main concern of protecting retail investors is satisfied.
Both cryptocurrency commentators and the CBOE have both concluded that the latest proposal meets all of SEC’s ETF approval requirements. This, coupled with a maturing cryptocurrency market, has led to widespread optimism around the approval of the ETF.

yep, used it and worked like a charm. You go to each exchange and made a download report for the year and import to the program. You have to pick your tax bracket, though. Whatever you file as your normal tax bracket will be the same. You can look it up on IRS website based on your yearly income. Use the calcuate tab to let it process all your trades. It has multiple methods and will tell you what the cheapest is and you just click that bubble to use it. The only issue I had is that if you do your taxes online with Turbotax, they have no option for uploading all the forms for the trades. I saw something about you having to used the DVD version which I am not going to use since I've always done it online. I just entered the full amount on the output report which is at the very bottom and takes some ciphering to see the 2 values to input but they should match the amount you owe. That is why I need to make 6K before April deadline :/

if you don't want to use software ( I used bitcointax and it worked great) then you need to write down every buy/sell and price. I tried that in the beginning but doing some day trading on occasion and during the dips made it hard quick but when I got Blockfolio app for my mobile, it was a game changer for me. I input every buy/sell and it has the date and what you bought and sold for how much so you keep a total of your portfolio. If nothing else, you could use that to keep track instead of pen/paper 
@_date: 2018-02-12 21:32:21
my idea was to sell it all at a price point but during the dip I've reconsidered and will withdraw a portion when it comes back to a good price point. I will then invest that into a business so I can quit working for shitty people doing shitty things and then I cannot complain about it anymore because I'll be the boss.

GDAX and Coinbase are tied together, you can send USD from GDAX to your bank, you don't need the extra step to Coinbase. I tried to look for the GBP to see if it is not the same way and it won't allow me because it isn't set up for my area (USA). On the BTC-GBP page in GDAX do you not see a "DEPOSIT" and "WITHDRAW" right under the amount of GBP you have? If so , you just click withdraw, select the type of currency and then select the bank account you have with Coinbase and that's it. No need to send to Coinbase side.

I think the easiest thing would be to put the key on a USB drive and put it in a safe deposit box at the bank. Give your heirs the key in your will. Assuming you die at some point in the future, most people will know how to download the wallet you left instructions on and use the USB to get the key and open the wallet. Leaving generic instructions with the USB..download "this" wallet, use the USB private key to open the wallet, SEND coins to "list exchanges" with your login information, Sell coins for cash and send to my bank account. They collect the cash.

This is incorrect according to the IRS. You pay tax on what you bought if you never sell it. In this case you pay tax on the $10k . They now consider it an asset no different from buying a car and saying I think I’ll wait until I sell it to pay any tax

lol, know what you mean. In the beginning people are like "down with cash, no banks, decentralized, use BTC only" and then you say, "okay! how do I get BTC?"..."Oh, you need to use cash"
Then you have to realize that at some point, businesses pay their employees in BTC, all stores accept BTC, etc. and then you get a bigger picture.

it is the same for a convenience store on your block. Go to the SHELL station and buy a loaf of bread or decide you want a cake mix late at night and not have to drive down to a Wal-Mart and try to find the 1 lane open at midnight and have to wait while 6 people are in line. You pay a bit more for the convenience. Some people just trying to get in for the first time may not understand about exchanges and just want to try it out. My old boss put an ATM in at a local business and I would have used it had I not just signed up on an exchange. Also, I was going to use it anyway to test it out but the damn thing was refurbished and broken all the time so I gave up and eventually left that job so I don't care to use his machine now.

perhaps you need to read the rules on the IRS' website. Clearly states you pay on what you buy. Kids table.....&gt;that way.

I can say this I’ve regretted every sale I’ve made over the year looking back. Had I hodled all those times I made a small profit I’d have huge profits. But I did take profit and invest in alts

@_date: 2018-12-25 04:04:27
sure 20 million people have a coin. 6 billion do not. At some point the 6 billion will move on with other types of currency because they can't buy one from the 20 million who will not sell them. Everyone is hodling so no one is using them to buy anything or pay anyone at their business.  Then, when people have moved on and no one will buy anything the 20 million have, they will start to panic and sell off but no one is buying because they've all moved on to the next thing. This will never happen with BTC, of course, but is a hypothetical based on the above scenario. If you can't have it, you move on. People still hold old stocks that have gone out of business because they can't sell them and they are worthless because we've "moved on" with other companies who are in business and turning profit but they still claim their stock is valuable 
@_date: 2018-12-24 22:15:31
Actually the opposite. If all coins were held with no trading they would be worthless like a rabbits foot in your pocket 
@_date: 2018-12-23 06:40:04
depends on which one you buy. There are some that have a wallet address with it and has $10, $50, etc. worth of BTC within it. dunno if this is one but they are out there.
