yeah it would be kind of lame if we had to send the shit to a wallet that supports it to be able to redeem it but you're right I wouldn't be too butt hurt

yeah I've been trying to figure this shit out too. I have mine in my electrum wallet right now but idk what to do with it now like wait and see what happens so I can use my private key later or send the private key to a wallet that supports it and wait to get the bch

Yeah I mean I saw a list of websites that have wallets that will support BCH so you're right if it comes out to be successful. I just wanted to see if I would be able to get that "extra cash" everyone has been talking about and don't want to miss out if it is actually worth it. I think if I understand it correctly, as long as you have your private key for yout BTC wallet you can autoimatically collect your BCH but I just don't know if you're supposed to have your BTC in a wallet that is gonna support it when the fork is done or can you keep it in your wallet right now and use your private key later to get the BCH then just convert it to BTC. I feel like it's simple but so confusing at the same time lol

from my understanding of bitcoin (which could be completely wrong it's just my interpretation of it) is that it's kind of like when the gold standard was still a thing. Like the amount of money you had equaled x amount of gold but you never really saw it. Like I said I could be wrong.
