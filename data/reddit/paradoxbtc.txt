Even for our customers we need to also collect info for KYC and ATF. It is very important that exchanges do this. People should see this and be happy to know that the exchange is taking an effort to protect funds.

Paper wallets is a good way to store a large amount, but keep multiple backups. 
What we do is generate a number of addresses, say like 5 then backup the private keys onto a secure, 2FA enabled, encrypted offline server. Then also back up the same keys in various other places including encrypted external drives, and paper wallets in a safe. This way if you lose one thing you have the others. Don't ever keep large amounts of bitcoin on an online wallet like blockchain. Use a local wallet like bitcoin-qt or even better Armory. This way if there site ever goes down or gets seized you still have the coin on your computer. But, as a rule of thumb, ALWAYS backup your wallet file.

Begging/asking for bitcoins is absolutely not allowed, no matter how badly you need the bitcoins. Only requests for donations to large, recognized charities are allowed, and only if there is good reason to believe that the person accepting bitcoins on behalf of the charity is trustworthy.
