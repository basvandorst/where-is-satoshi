In this situation though the net sum change of the amount of bitcoin that he holds is zero. He only intends to buy and sell on two different exchanges netting him $50k extra in USD without having to transfer anything between the accounts. 100 BTC on Kraken is the same as 100 BTC GDAX. 100 coins is 100 coins.

Ya USD is so useless. Cant buy anything with it.

Ok, now I know you're a troll.

And when he takes his fat profits and buys things with it I'm pretty sure they wont charge him large fees for the privilege of transferring the money to the seller

or gaining value w.r.t Bitcoin....

The same thing happened to me. Took just over a week before my account was verified. Was verified just earlier this week.

Yep, You are correct.
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:35:46
True, but if you want something trusty worthy that wont gauge you by making you use credit cards to purchase then you'll have to be patience while they verify your account

The same thing happened to me. It just takes time. Was just over a week for me before i got the enhanced verification approved.

of course not. But having a diversified financial base is key to preserving wealth. The bitcoin market is much to volatile to be betting your retirement on. Case in point, look at the market today....
Also not a gramps, I'm 27. Just been fortunate with the investment opportunities I've had.

How do you know he's not buying bonds, ETF''s, and blue chip stocks? Because that would be a fools errand too? I actually am retiring in 3 years from now. Feel free to pull up your sunbed anytime

If you have the money in one account and bitcoins in another as he's saying you dont need to transfer between the exchanges.
