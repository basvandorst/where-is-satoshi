Argh. I was hoping someone would link to posts here that he said shouldn't exist, like anti-core or anti-segwit. I guess I must search on my own :(

Well that, and their transaction history would fill bitcoins public blockchain blocks instantly. And the latency, and issues of maleability, and regulatory uncertainty, and being slave to the miners, and sometimes the network gets attacked, hmm, I'm probably forgetting a few.

It's in there somewhere, someone typed it up: 
  "Upgrade in a decentralized system must come from the many to the few.  If the upgrade comes from the few to the many, even if it is the right thing: that thing from a central point of power destroys the whole fucking gamut.  You have to get your stack right: 1. Censorship resistance 2. Security 3. Everything else: Outreach, marketing, adoption, user experience."

Bitcoin is pretty lucky that Adam Back cares deeply about digital scarcity, and not breaking it with alt's, or risk. Chaumian cash failed.

If eth hype is going to pump and dump scam everyone (because Smart contracts may be mostly useless until and *if oracles ever gets solved) Then it's better to have the hype in this chain where it won't dump.

For the love of god, please stop alternate implementations. Look at it like this. Consensus is the name of the game. The same code everywhere fucks up (or doesn't) similarly. When you have multiple implementations you will have different bugs at different times and those bugs will interact with each other in unpredictable ways, every new implementation makes consensus more than exponentially harder. Now, if a new version to core that is superior was written, and tested, and became majority in use, then it should be the sole champion of consensus.  As you can see, there's a problem trying to reach that reality when the costs of consensus failure is so high compared to the gain of a new implementation of the same shit.
Consensus is a bitch, but its the only reason bitcoin is worth anything, so tread as though you were upgrading the software of your 777 airplane in flight, and you're on the flight.
p.s. if you want thoughtful analysis of why you shouldn't do multiple code implementations I can link you to Adam Back, or the ETH downtime, or critical safety standards in software from nasa, or the halting problem, or formal software verification.  If you want to get into the smart people shit.

Talking shit requires 10x less effort than refuting shit. In crypto, people don't even understand the refutations. Thus, crypto is ripe for shit talkers making false claims and getting away with it.

Written to him: All charlatans want their rubes to discover how clever they truly were. The love they didn’t get voluntarily when they were young, they try to take by force later in life. You can’t find love at the end of the barrel of a gun.
Come clean. Be free of the layers and layers of stories you must keep track of. Free of the twitching and worry that you could have done something better. You can shower without having conversations in your head with interlocutors you may never meet.
Perhaps this movie can help you find a path.  There is great peace in honest living.

Tweeting an article doesn't equal making all the statements in an article. Perhaps ask him for a good quote you can use? Actually, it's circular logic to quote a man quoting the article quoting the man quoting the article...
I guess you can edit your article to cite quotes from anyone that links to or tweets it out. I guess you could disclose that tweeting or linking your article will cause you to be cited as "saying" the title of the article?
