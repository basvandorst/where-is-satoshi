And how much is Kraken contributing to this open source software that they're completely dependent on?

You don't have to be Turing complete to write smart contracts.

Not several years. Main net transactions are already happening. I conservatively predict well start to see adoption gaining gradual traction by 2nd half of this year.

No. The operator of the node commenting *wants* to produce bigger blocks due to the backlog but the software is generating random sizes instead.

I second this. It forces higher level software and users to optimize consumption of block space, which is essential for scaling regardless of any block size increase in the future or not.

Nope, won't be participating. As a coinbase customer since 2013 they've already lost me thanks to this but also plenty else. They're not getting me back by just implementing segwit now. Too little too late.

One of the main advantages of side chains is that they don't need to comply to the same stringent security standards of the main chain which everything depends. They allow room for experimentation, and are totally opt in. If you find the risk worth it you can use it, if not then don't. 
The plan as far as I know is to use the knowingly problematic fed peg design to show a live proof of concept and test demand for a side chain like rootstock. If it's sufficient and the side chain starts getting traction in the community, it will hopefully speed up the R&amp;D and eventual implementation of something like Drivechains that is far more trustless and that rootstock will then be able to migrate to.

There is no way to make it not optional. The only question is did you want to split the ecosystem over it or not via a hardfork.

Display both alongside each other. Allows for a steady adjustment.

Id argue credit is the perfect name, precisely because of the fact it requires no trust. It's the perfect embodiment of "credit" if you will. Credit to that individual for having created value at some point that's universally recognized by society through the network we all secure and validate. 
I am high however so upvote or downvote accordingly so I know if I'm on to something tomorrow.

Wasn't aware of the dynamics of the "feather forking" attack, sounds worrying. 
He makes the point however that while a lot of these strategies are theoretically profitable we don't have evidence of them being employed in the wild. Is there a good line of discussion as to why this is the case? 
Great talk and overall summarization of these attack vectors btw.
