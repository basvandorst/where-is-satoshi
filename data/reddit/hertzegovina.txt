Bitcoin price anywhere near $10k says you're right

The real irony is that that puts him roughly on the same level as the average user in this forum
@_date: 2019-07-03 21:14:52
The first thing you said makes my half of my case. "and crypto/blockchain in general". The technology is exciting, bitcoin is not. There is no real world use that can't be copied practically instantly, and improved upon depending on what the application is. I doubt the whole idea of using it as a currency, even if you make it work technically, but I don't doubt there are plenty of other places it can be useful. 
But, please, do convince me a monkey with a couple of years in college isn't enough to do financial modeling. Let's hear a speculative use case for bitcoin, and why a valuation of $10k makes sense. Lay it out for me. At least, convince me you have any useful indicators in your financial model for bitcoin.
I don't think my viewpoint is lacking, I have just heard your bullshit 100 times before by people who peddle other people's shit and like to listen to their own voice. There's nothing philosophically or technically challenging about what you're saying. The fact that you bring that sort of "the value of everything is what we believe it is" cop out bullshit only makes me take you less serious. I was gonna go on to elaborate a bit but you used the word "leverage" in the same way my 60 year old colleague does when he wants to sound like he has business smarts and it just makes all this feel pretty pointless.
@_date: 2019-07-02 23:12:05
Yeah, unfortunately there are people on the other end of it for every person who made money since bitcoin has absolutely no value in and of itself
@_date: 2019-07-02 23:19:54
You're arguing with people who have no concept of what investing is. No dividend, no production, no use case but they still think that it prints money not understanding that it has to come from somewhere. Or as in this case, someone. I applaud you for trying but in case you need it, here's a tip: cut your losses in terms of time and sanity. Cheers.
@_date: 2019-07-03 18:36:42
No, that's not it. Most things have a use case which makes them valuable. That's the basis for how you assess any investment. You can't make that assessment of bitcoin. Buying bitcoin is like going to the casino and betting on red.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:19:19
Even if it starts out well funded that will change depending on when people get income and their spending patterns too. Waiting for the first premium lightning network to pop up where you have to buy in with at least x amount of bitcoin while most people are stuck on congested networks where most of people's capital is used to move money. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 05:01:13
Right... Pretty sure we just covered that 2-3 times. It's unusable. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:14:32
Why this here is not asked more often is one thing that really blows my mind about this whole community. People are too emotionally invested to make rational decisions. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:24:51
I tend to agree with you. The first hurdle looks like it will be to find a currency that actually works as such in terms of transaction fees and times. The other thing I'm waiting for is a reasonable solution to deflation too. Having deflationary pressure on a currency makes no sense imo. A currency that discourages spending, lending and promotes hoarding has a fundamental flaw and will never be a real contender to our current currencies I don't think. I'm not sure why people think it's such a good idea.
@_date: 2017-12-07 06:34:39
Not sure why they mince, answer is "yes"
@_date: 2017-12-16 09:21:16
What do you mean? It's not like the bitcoin price is... Oh, right. Heh. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 07:33:28
Yes it's true for both. I'm in no way suggesting bitcoin is better. Not at all. And deflationary because the mining will come to an end and to some extent coins are getting lost, which means people expect the scarcity to go down and prices with it. That discourages spending, lending and investing which is the opposite of what you want out of a currency. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:54:05
You're not wrong but credit where credit is due. The image is hilarious. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 00:06:30
The technology is not bound to Bitcoin and it's simple to copy. I am happy for OP and I think the idea and technology has a clear future but at what point does it become a sham? The fact that you say it's not speculative if the whole world believes shows the issue at it's core. You ascribe it value mainly based on others' faith.
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:00:03
If you don't want to risk a price drop in bitcoin to hurt you a new fiscal year starts in less than 2 weeks so you should not have to put things off very long because of any such considerations. Just keep in mind that depending on your income you'd have to declare capital gains within a few months as well as a year from now. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:26:09
Is this actually how you think or are you trolling to keep the train tooting?
@_date: 2017-12-23 07:25:30
That people are getting way too deep into this bitcoin vs bitcoin cash drama. Emotions getting stirred up like it's a sports game or something. In the midst of it, important shit gets lost. While bitcoin cash is a much better solution than bitcoin there's a fundamental problem with having a currency that's deflationary in that it discourages use and encourages hoarding. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 21:02:56
You're still talking about currencies in terms of profits and losses. Looooong way to go. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 13:53:01
I am no tax expert by any means, so make sure to confirm before you make any financial decisions based on this but I think splitting the sales over two years to end up in a lower bracket should be fine. However, capital gains is dependent on your annual income as well so whether your rate is 0% or not I cannot tell you.
@_date: 2017-12-19 07:13:34
Despite the lulz this would probably be good advice for a lot of people. In this case it looks like it was held over a year which means long term capital gains, if he's that broke then rate will probably be zero. But yeah. Lol. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:23:05
On board for what? The whole problem is the value compared to the price. Getting more people invested and raising the price doesn't solve that problem, it exacerbates it.
As for layer two solutions, I'm aware they are being considered but I'm not sure how they would be implemented. Looking at it without knowing the details I can't help but to wonder what it means for the integrity of the currency.
It was late, maybe I was a bit unclear. The point is to ask why people who become rich off of bitcoin sell their bitcoin. The answer is just another way of showing the problem, even among people who evidently have had faith in bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:51:58
Absolutely no worries at all, I'm happy if it helped.
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:54:07
What you wrote about a price floor based on most recent price makes no sense. With bitcoin in mind, you can make the argument you're making right now about the crash in 2007. Before that crash we witnessed a new era and the birth of a whole slew of financial instruments. At the time everyone thought it was rock-solid because the backbone of the value was the housing market. In fact, you can make that argument for any other crash before that as well. Bubbles happen because people, for a whole myriad of reasons, estimate the price far over the value and then often go on to justify their decisions, which leads to groupthink. Every time there is a big group of "smart" people who are invested in the problem telling one another "this time is different because..." before it comes down. Remind you of something?
With respect to what you're saying about scratching the surface of cryptocurrencies, you are probably right in general. However, for what you're saying to apply to bitcoin's value it has to have some technological edge or other value that competing cryptocurrencies lack. It does not. Quite the opposite, in fact. As I am not invested in any cryptocurrency I do not have a hard time looking at this circus without significant bias and to me it seems fairly clear that bitcoin has a lot of big downfalls which makes it terrible as a currency. In other words, it is not a long term solution and there are other cryptocurrencies that have a much higher value despite being priced lower.

Hi there in 2097, if you're reading this, I know it looks weird but yes, 80 years ago this was indeed the movement that suggested they were going to put banks out of business. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:24:32
"securing local fiat into storage of long-term wealth" and "bitcoin obviously fulfills that need"
The bitcoin price is built on speculation and the volatility creates positive feedback because everyone thinks they can make a quick buck. The irony is that the volatile price makes it even worse as an actual currency and storage for value than it was before and thus actually lowers it's real value. I hope that the people who can't afford to lose their money get out before the actual dip comes where price drops down to match that value.
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:07:05
I never said there are no hubs, I think the system already has its flaws but to some extent that's needed in order to allow for bigger adoption. What I don't think is that there being centralized layer on top of bitcoin is an argument for adding another one or making people more dependent on them. What I do think is that my point still stands. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 07:19:07
It's terrible as a currency because the transaction cost is very high, both in time and money so again, it's just a speculative vehicle at this point. Since the tech is not bound to bitcoin it does not explain the price.
For the record I'm not scared, I'm not at all invested in it so I have nothing to lose. In fact, I think the idea is brilliant but that doesn't change the fact that the price is absurd based in it's uses and so I asked the question "when does it become a sham?"
And for your talk of oppression by the banks etc, explain to me why it is that the people who make fortunes on bitcoin and retire early do so by exchanging their bitcoins for dollars?
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:32:31
Lightning network looks like it will just create another gatekeeper because if you analyze the idea, the best way to make it useful would be to have huge hubs that a lot of people connect to. Essentially the online version of banks and credit card companies rolled into one.
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:09:24
I see. Yes, essentially but it's not necessarily 365 days. I beieve you start counting the day after you acquire an asset and "one year" is that date one year later. So if you acquired an asset today, it would be considered long-term on 12/20/2018.
@_date: 2017-12-23 03:04:00
Well, bitcoin cash is still deflationary so while bitcoin might be unusable already, bitcoin cash isn't a serious option as a currency for major use.

So it's not a currency but a payment network... Great distinction there mate. It doesn't work as either, happy? 
And your whole idea of value is plain retarded. What you're saying is that something that is replicabile without any major costs and has a ridicolous number of competitors for that reason should be considered to have some intrinsic value. You're trying to sell sand in a desert but not only that, you think you're selling water. 
Thanks for explaining basic math to me, allow me to go out on a limb and say that's not the issue here. The whole point about bitcoin is that it doesn't matter what you define it as, how many tiny pieces you can divide it into, how free from government control or anything else it is because you cannot use it. 
About gold... Of course it CAN be, but we have much, Much better options today so nobody is interested in doing so. It has other use cases but they add little value? How the fuck do you gather that demand does not drive its value?! I can't even tell if you're serious or just trying to cheese me at this point. Only way I'm shooting myself in the foot here is trying to elaborate on this for you without the use of crayons.

I'll have to have a look at what happened last time.
"Feature" that makes it useless as a currency. What you call it doesn't change the fact that it's under constant deflationary pressure. 
Main incentive for btc for a long time was low TX fees.
Layers are already proving to have similar sets of issues, leading to centralization etc. 
@_date: 2019-03-07 20:35:01

@_date: 2019-03-30 16:58:37
That's the dumbest fucking thing I've read all week and completely emblematic of the biggest problem this this community has. 
Don't you question why cars are so expensive?! They're fucking terrible as currency!
And ironically, gold used to be very good as currency because it's relatively soft and therefore easy to split, and being shiny and pretty it's been in demand everywhere for jewelery and ornaments. Since then of course, the modern world has found new use cases. 
There's your reason, aside from being shiny and pretty. You seeing anyone using bitcoin for electronics or make jewelery out of it? 
@_date: 2019-03-31 01:10:03
Lightning inevitably leads to centralization because it depends on the lowest amount of btc in a chain of channels. Too expensive? Not worth it? How naive do you have to be to call that secure? What you're really saying is that nobody, as far as we know, has been motivated enough to do it.
No, it doesn't matter. There are no financial reasons. In fact, I think, if I asked you to explain those financial reasons you'd fall flat on your face because you've been way out of your depth since your initial post. As for digital gold, that's a pipe dream, there's no consensus and the alt coins your mention are mostly shit because they are based off of... Yeah, you know. My point isn't that a copy of bitcoin would become popular, my point was that bitcoin has zero intrinsic value and can be recreated at any time. The value would come from use, like it does from other currencies, but since it can't be used that's not happening. The only thing keeping the price of bitcoin from dropping like a rock are people like you who do not understand enough to see where it's headed, and/or hope you can make some dollars (ironically) off of it.
As for a credit card, I don't care if you call it a fucking zenetherbitcard, as long as there's an intermediary you and people you deal with have to trust to handle the transaction you lose your decentralization and you're back to square one. 
Again you show your lack of fundamental understanding of money. They're a good store of value because they're predictable and liquid. When you store your value in money it's because there's an expectation that you'll get shit for it later and you can have that expectation because you can fairly accurately tell what your money will be worth in the next month, year or years. Speaking of which, stability is another thing bitcoin completely lacks. Why? Because it isn't used enough. Why? Because not enough people can use I at the same time and it's expensive. So where is the value? Bingo. Digital gold...... Lol!
It's fucking crazy to me that there are still people in this community who think they've learned something nobody else understands and that somehow they understand the economy better than everyone else, including all of the people who make their living in the system. There's no fucking magic to bitcoin. It doesn't break economics. You can analyze it like anything else. I'm sorry if this bursts your magical btc bubble but that's the reality. 
@_date: 2019-03-31 00:08:19
This is absurd. Decentralization is getting hammered by lightning in an attempt to make it work. Security you have no idea about because it's already clear 51% attacks are a very real possibility and the general consensus so far is that it seems to have not been a problem so far. To any person with any sense, who's also looking at bitcoin that's a huge issue. And that's me not caring about the horrendous Tx times which makes it fucking useless in almost any regular situation. 
Yes I mean alts and you got it completely fucked up. Who was first is not relevant in any other sense than adoption where btc has a head start. Anyone can replicate btc and make just as "fair". You could literally make an alt called bitcoin2, with the exact same properties as bitcoin. As for secure, that's literally your perception because so far it has barely been tested. I will agree that simply because it's more adopted than any alt coin, it's probably safer but if you're looking at where it is compared to what general adoption would look like you'd realize that it's fucking nowhere and could be overtaken by any alt coin. What you're really outlining is an emotional connection between you and bitcoin, and that's fine but you should realize that it makes it valuable to you but matters fuckall for anyone else.
I can make my money in USD and spend them in Europe, or the other way around. I have, many times, and I gladly pay the bank a small fee for that transaction because it works seamlessly. I don't assume it should be accepted everywhere, I actually assume there'll be a lot of places successful cryptocurrencies will not be accepted, especially initially, but right now it's accepted practically nowhere and that's a problem for it whether you like it or not.
Those pieces of paper that "can be printed on a whim" are vastly superior to gold as currency. Vastly superior to bitcoin as well. The fact that you're able to sit comfortably and write your nonsense on this forum is largely thanks to our monetary system, so if you think governments are the only ones who benefit, then that, again, says more about your understanding of the system than the system itself.

@_date: 2019-03-08 10:02:50
What you're saying has little or no relation to what I'm saying, I mentioned the point earlier because you seem to be missing it.
Im curious though, how do you see a path for BTC ever getting to a point where it's a viable currency? How will it overcome the risk of 51% attacks? How will it overcome not being inflationary by design? How will it overcome losing the incentive to perform the hashing? How will it overcome tx limitations? Genuinely asking because I'm curious since you seem fairly sure that this is happening. 
@_date: 2019-03-08 09:12:51
Fatal flaw detector ringing like a motherfucker as you base your idea on the assumption that people use btc to pay for things. Half of the point is that a vast majority of people look at the value of btc in usd because once they own it they treat it as an investment, making all of this "soon btc is taking over" bullshit even more obnoxious than it is at face value as their interest is in $$$, and not the actual success of btc or any other cryptocurrency. 
@_date: 2018-06-16 19:27:55

No, we're failing to regulate players in the system, that's a different issue. Are you going to create a system where there is no credit? No mortgages? Unless you're interested in setting up a communist state you'll have to explain how you expect all of this to change.
You didn't say cryptocurrency, you said bitcoin. But assuming you create a currency that had attributes which would make it viable as such, you'd still need to figure out real world problems like how to limit power consumption. While a lot of crypto kids like to brush it off like "oh but it's only the consumption of a SMALL country", the reality is that that's the case now but now crypto is completely insignificant in the real world. It has zero bearing on anything in the real world except maybe two or three lucky speculators buying a lambo. You try to implement this for everyone and you're looking at a completely different scale and some very scary prospects. And again, I'm not saying "ok that's it, let's go home!", I'm just saying for something that adds no value (read bitcoin) it's a very high cost. 
@_date: 2018-06-18 20:28:48
That's fine, but if you expect value out of bitcoin you're wasting your time. 
Look forward to it? I suppose that's the difference between us, I don't find any enjoyment in events that cause people to lose their jobs. I am interested in innovation for what it can do to move us forward, not based on how much money I can make from it.

@_date: 2018-06-18 15:01:05
...it's not a failing system. Unfortunately humans are involved, greedy humans, so if the rules are made in a way they can exploit then they will. That's the fault of politicians and human nature as much as economists. If you try to argue the crypto space is any different you're just fooling yourself. 
I get charged something similar, which is fine by me for not having to deal with the hassle as it comes out to a small %. That's not even counting whatever the transaction fee is on bitcoin at this point and whatever the cost would be to exchange them on both ends. 
As for lightning network I'm skeptical, there have been clear obstacles for it from the start. Not only technical but how it would function practically without ending up with huge central hubs because of how channels are set up between people. Truthfully haven't kept track of the lightning development over the past few months but in general I'm not a fan of layering because I think as soon as you add anything on top of the fundamental structure you risk giving up a bit of the decentralized control which is one of the most compelling features of cryptocurrencies. 
@_date: 2018-06-15 06:59:50
Then I can only repeat my answer once more, it's not scary speculation. The only part that's scary is that not more people are worried about it.

Interesting tidbits but the most important quote of that interview was probably "I mean, first of all, I’m not an economist". 
@_date: 2018-06-15 19:24:24
First of all, inflation is arguably necessary for a currency because it encourages spending rather than saving. Hodl might seem like a great idea but it's actually detrimental to a currency if it happens on a scale that's disproportionate to usage, and when taken to an extreme (read, over a long period of time) it will hamper the economy, lead to volatility and likely ruin the value of a currency. Just look at bitcoin over the last year, should give you a hint. 
That takes us right to the core of the issue which is volatility. It is much more relevant than the level of inflationary pressure. Often they're correlated which is why they're often confused but volatility is what's really bad because it makes people lose confidence while inflation isn't necessarily bad. 
This is not to say we have a perfect system, but it's the best one we've come up with so far. The idea that bitcoin would somehow be immune to a collapse is ridiculous. 
@_date: 2018-06-15 17:22:29
No, but I do have a healthy mix of common sense, critical thinking and economics education that's not from YouTube. Instead of questioning my motives, how about you question my argument and explain where you think it fails? Here are a couple of very fundamental facts: reserve currencies should not be volatile and bitcoin is very volatile. 
@_date: 2018-06-17 15:43:38
You're still thinking about it as an investment, which is natural given its attributes but is also why it will never have any real value.
To be clear, that's not to try to discredit the blockchain as a whole because the technology is here to stay. Bitcoin, however, has already served its purpose in introducing the technology to the world. Time for people to take the lessons and develop viable options that can actually be valuable. 
@_date: 2018-06-16 20:09:22
Also missing the surrounding parts: "does" and "still exist?" 
@_date: 2018-06-17 18:02:04
I do understand it and I have no illusions about the fact that the blockchain technology will be around. That said, bitcoin is a flawed implementation.
Yes, there are economists who would argue with that just like there are people on this /r who will yell "HODL!!" even if bitcoin goes below $100. The reality is that in practice we have set on our system because trade and making the most of comparative advantages helps everyone, and inflationary currencies encourage trade. There is a reason bitcoin is just treated as an investment vehicle. That is pretty absurd in itself, but it shows how people find a way to justify bitcoins existence and this goes to the point where you quoted Henry Ford, there's a general misconception that money has no value and that it's all in our head. Do we determine it's price? Yes, but it's value to us is in its usefulness which I something bitcoin lacks. When it was clear it was terrible as a means of exchange people started parroting the idiotic idea that it's like gold, talk about being sold a bill of goods. 
I mention this because no matter what credentials you quote or how much you write in support of the general ideas (which I agree with, for the most part!) beware that you're doing it as you're defending bitcoin. Unless you can give credence to the product actually having underlying value you're just building a con.
...And if you doubt peoples attitude towards economists and the idea that they're "stuck in old ways" , just look at the other answer to my initial post. Perfect case of someone not understanding economics claiming economists don't understand integral parts of the economy...

I realize you think you're a genius but the fact that you're responding like this in a thread where a person is clearly talking about it as an investment makes my image of you turn more and more ape-like. Ascribing things to my person that are based on squat doesn't help. How links to applications that could use any blockchain help the value of the bitcoin blockchain I'm also not sure of.
I wholeheartedly agree that the whole idea of using the technology as a currency is a sideshow, but that doesn't remove the fact that the bitcoin blockchain can be replicated with ease. Arguably, it can be improved upon and that begs the question how long the bitcoin blockchain can live off of its first mover advantage. Reality is that right now the price is massively propped up by speculators who have been sold on the idea of a currency, digital gold and all the other jazz.
Unless you have a response that might make me revise the somewhat primal idea I have of you, I'll stop responding here as this gets us nowhere. Cheers.

No, the problem is people like you who form an emotional bond to bitcoin and can't accept any kind of criticism with reasoning. This eco chamber where criticism is suppressed rather than met with any kind of arguments will just end up hurting the community more than anything else. I suggest you start by recognizing that bitcoin failing isn't you failing. Cut that emotional bond.

I'm arguing the common idea among people in this subreddit (and in general, to be frank) that you were repeating which is that all central banks do is print money which shows a complete lack of understanding of how our banking system actually works. The fact that I currently believe this to be the best system we have by a huge margin doesn't mean that I agree with everything that happens in it. 
Let me try to explain then, in short, why I'm skeptical to LN. If I want to send you money and we have an open channel, it's no problem. However, if there's one person between us he has to have enough money to cover the payment available for it to go through. So if you have 4-5 steps between people it only gets worse. The communal solution to this is to have a lot of users connect to big hubs that have a lot of capacity. However, then the problem becomes that these hubs become central powers on the network who will not only have to make money somehow but it also goes against the fundamental idea of bitcoin to have a decentralized system.
I'm sure there's money to be made, but the fact that you look at cryptocurrencies as investment vehicles shows the problem with it. It has no intrinsic value without use (trading for speculation isn't sufficient) which means until there is use there will always be a sucker losing his money at the end of the line. 
@_date: 2018-06-18 17:27:44
Short answer is no, central banks don't create more liquidity at all, banks do by extending credit. Central banks just try to keep this creation in check with various tools that they have. 
No, of course there's a chance that LN will be exactly that. There's also a chance that Japan wins the world cup and that NJ transit will have a full year where all trains run on time. 
And no, it's not inherently resistant, it's dependent on large size and a high number of miners. If you miss either of those you're exposed to attack. It wouldn't surprise me one bit if there are nation-states who would be able to destroy bitcoin right now. 
I don't know what articles you've read but the reality is that it's already a concern and bitcoin is insignificant right now. 
Of course I'll say it's a terrible store of value, it is! It's extremely volatile which is the complete opposite of the predictability you want. I don't know why anyone would say bitcoin is good to depend on, that's just pure guesswork. 
...and yet again, no. You're comparing bitcoin with something on a scale and complexity that it seems you can't appreciate. There's not one set of controls for all of the world's monetary systems where a group of greedy bankers sit and hit a big red "PRINT" button when they want some extra cash. This isn't tether we're talking about... 
@_date: 2019-08-26 00:21:39
Good for you, having some kind of skepticism holding you back. Bitcoin might go up before it goes down but it's horrendous as a currency, has proven it can't handle even extremely low adoption without secondary layers, and has a proven track record of being a terrible store of value. People who are in to bitcoin tend to talk up how it's "finite", "appreciating" etc, but in reality that's one of its major drawbacks as it's encouraging "hodling" and discouraging use. A currency derives its value from being used, again, making bitcoin terrible as a currency. While gold has intrinsic value as it's physically being used to make jewelery, ornaments and for electronics, there's demand for it (and as you mentioned, this has held true for thousands of years) while bitcoin is just a construct of 0s and 1s that can be replicated easily at extremely low cost. The only thing keeping bitcoin alive is a decently sized group of people who don't understand this.
I'd say bitcoin has been tested and failed as a currency, and that the exciting takeaway will be technologies spawned from the idea of a decentralized ledger.
@_date: 2018-06-18 13:58:58
So you're saying we have a system that's "failing", in your own words, but you want to keep it. Surprised faces allover...
I haven't said crypto is slow for international payments. But, as someone who regularly sends payments internationally I still wouldn't use bitcoin since it doesn't work as a currency. I rather wait 2 days than buy intermediary tokens that have to be exchanged on both ends.
And no, offsetting the cost isn't enough. It incurs a huge cost on the currency as well as the environment. Again, if you scale it up to any significant level it becomes untenable. 
@_date: 2018-06-17 13:46:42
As a computer scientist, thank you for those words. Nice to know there are people who appreciate that a lot goes in to what we do.
That said, my reaction stems from the fact that he seems unaware of a lot of fundamental facts. For example, inflation shouldn't be fought, we have inflation because it makes sense for currencies (not just fiat currencies)when you consider the function they're primarily supposed to fill which is being a medium of exchange.
Another example is claiming people don't understand how cryptocurrencies acquire value because they don't understand the technology. I would agree with the first part of that, if he would concede it has very little to do with the technology and that the biggest group to misunderstand its value or how it gains value intersects with a majority of people who are invested in bitcoin. The idea that economists do not understand crypto is asinine, because just like programming isn't about just learning the keywords and syntax of a language, understanding money isn't about understanding how it's printed. As an economist, as long as you understand its attributes you can make a good analysis. Somehow the idea that economists are irrelevant because they "don't understand" crypto has become a popular line to drop but it completely misrepresents what an economist needs to know in order to say something useful. On top of that, a person whose main source of information is videos like the one in this is somehow an expert who can confidently say that economists are wrong. The fact that he sits down in interviews and perpetuates that FUD is part of why it's a shame that he's taken seriously. 
Frankly, how can anyone take him seriously when he goes full on pseudo intellectual and drops this unrelated line in an answer: "I think control is an illusion, and maintaining the illusion of control with the illusion of power is delusion". I wonder how long he had practiced that in front of the mirror thinking its going to sound awesome... Either way, I'm getting off the subject. I could go on but this is already turning in to something that needs a tl;dr. 
@_date: 2018-06-18 20:15:54
The problem is that you're part of propping up the price of something that has no underlying value, no dividends, nothing. I'm not saying speculation shouldn't be allowed, I'm just saying there's no value there and that cycle being repeated is detrimental to the space as a whole.
There's no irony at all, you can't even compare the two. The banking system has allowed for us to make more progress in the past century than all of human history before it. It's one of the most significant reasons we have more people than ever living in comfort. It allows people to buy homes, start businesses and the list continues for miles. Again, and I can't stress this enough, that doesn't mean that I agree with or support everything that happens within the banking system. What I do react to is when someone like yourself claims its full of robbers and crooks when the reality is you probably wouldn't be able to write the post on the internet on whatever device you're using without it. I'm very conscious of the benefits that bitcoin promised, I'm also very conscious of the fact that there is great inequality in our current system and that it's far from perfect but that doesn't change all of the good things we've managed to create because of it and that we have no better substitute. 
@_date: 2019-08-26 05:46:09
It's hilarious that you're getting down voted, in a sad way. You've heard correctly but as has been mentioned several times it's because you attach a pseudonym to your transactions. If your identity can be attached to the pseudonym then all of a sudden everything you've done with your btc is not only trackable but also public.
You don't sound condescending but you're dealing with people who seem to attach part of their identity in the success of btc. Keep questioning things, it's healthy.

I could make up a currency right now, create a trillion digital units of it and buy one unit for 10 dollars, giving my currency a market cap of 10 trillion. Do you think that means I could buy Ford, Goldman Sachs and Lockheed Martin? Indeed, maybe some day bitcoin will be worth something... 
@_date: 2018-06-17 01:12:39
I think you're mistaken to be frank, if you look at trading volume measured in USD over the past 6 months there were peaks at 3-5 billion around dec, but the general volume is between 0.5-1.5 bn. That puts it in a bit of a different light. Personally, the fact that this is even a consideration is a bit outrageous, because yes, players try to manipulate markets all the time but when you have a player that can do it with currency they can create themselves it's a different ballgame, which should scare anyone.
Edit: should add that I've taken that data from blockchain.info. Should also add that it counts all trading from "major bitcoin exchanges", so I make the assumptions that most of that trading is bitcoin which I believe is fair because if that's false, it only helps my argument. 
...and before someone chimes in "print money amagad fiat werks like dat!!!" let me just clarify that no, in the banking industry it there's no parallel to tether and if there was it would have destroyed whatever it was used for, which is the difference that's relevant in this case. 
@_date: 2018-06-15 14:24:28
So your rationale is that the most used currency in the world would start to suffer from hyperinflation and the response from governments would be to buy a digital asset that's extremely volatile? You're asking for it so, yeah, that's pretty absurd. 
@_date: 2018-06-15 06:44:40
No it's not, it's necessary "speculation" that any sane person interested in investing their hard earned money should do. The fact (yes, fact) that tether can be created out of thin air is a foregone conclusion for anyone with any resemblance of understanding of technology. The question is if that creation is backed by dollars or not. The fact that we can even ask this question without being able to answer it after this much time should raise huge red flags for anyone. How you and other kids come to any other conclusion boggles my mind. I hope it stems from not understanding the economics rather than being willing to deny facts to maintain your views, for your sakes.

The blockchain is exactly what's interesting because of what it can enable us to do outside of centrally controlling institutions. I've just come to a point where I think it's clear that bitcoin is fundamentally flawed and has served its purpose. Surely, you must realize that bitcoin proponents don't have a monopoly on understanding? 
Frankly, I'm not sure what you're arguing. You don't seem to defend bitcoin but you clearly want to defend your idols (lack for better word) who do, which has me confused. It almost seems like you wrote all that to say "you just don't see it yet", which would be very disappointing because you don't seem to lack for sources when it comes to perspective. 
@_date: 2018-06-18 05:41:24
Bad shape by what metric? 
I don't know what you're trying to say. 
I think you're fundamentally wrong because even if one can't understand the underlying technology you don't need to in order to understand its attributes - and if you understand the attributes you can make an analysis.
@_date: 2018-06-16 19:33:55
Last time I read an article where someone tried to prove the issuance was too small they were comparing it to the market cap rather than the trade volume
@_date: 2018-06-18 13:15:09
I don't think you understand what the function of the economy is in society.
Sure it has a use case, so does monopoly money. That doesn't mean it has a function in the economy. 
@_date: 2018-06-18 18:22:58
No, that is to cover banks who have too small a fraction of reserves. That's not how money is created.
You're just speculating and saying "it could be great!". Don't know what kind of answer you expect. I understand it and I am not impressed. The blockchain is beautiful in its relative simplicity. LN is nothing like it and while it's a nice idea, it has a lot of practical problems that I don't see them overcoming without changing the ethos of what bitcoin is trying to achieve.
Again, yes there are a high number of miners but you're still thinking too small. You can't compare it to other cryptocurrencies or bitcoin a few years ago. You have to consider what would be needed to be able to actually depend on for commerce and other fundamental functions in our society, and in that light it's too vulnerable.
You should read past the headline on that article, it actually mentions reasons why bitcoin isn't viable right there. Either way, to get to the point, those are extreme measures and not what central banks usually do (or in my opinion, are supposed to do at all). And while I personally don't think that's a solution, it definitely isn't the cause of the problems in the eurozone. That's a completely different topic, though.
Not sure how you come to that conclusion, you not understanding what I'm saying isn't the same as me not knowing what I'm talking about. 
@_date: 2019-04-25 04:57:59
You're making assumptions along the line of the market knowing what the fuck they're doing. If they did it would be much closer to zero already. The only thing factored in to the price is what people think the next person will pay for it.
@_date: 2019-04-25 23:17:57
It sounds like you're still in school, in which case I applaud you for picking an exciting subject and clearly hitting the books. However, you're applying theory to a point where all you're saying is that what's happening can be explained by theory you know rather than try to understand the erratic behavior in front of you. Saying "it might seem erratic to you but to the collective millions as a whole it isn't" might keep you in a comfortable, safe space but it gets you nothing and nowhere in terms of understanding.
@_date: 2019-04-25 11:42:34
I'm not saying it's not a true market I'm just saying that the idea that the price is arrived at by some informed consensus which is the essence of what you're saying makes no sense when the only information people care about is what the price is at the same time as there are several players who can completely manipulate it.
@_date: 2019-04-05 11:07:54
Would mean it's a terrible store of value lol 
@_date: 2019-04-25 07:05:49
Yeah but I base my assumption on the result of analyzing bitcoin. Your assumption sounds like it's based on theory that also makes assumptions about how the market functions to come to that conclusion but those assumptions aren't true in this case. Some players have the means to move the entire market, massively. In other words, the insignificance of one single opinion and the collective average becomes a moot point, especially as others use the price as their primary factor when making buy or sell decisions.
@_date: 2019-04-26 00:05:04
No what you're explaining is how the market should work according to theory, but when you say you're the far out from school I just become more curious as to why you're on here saying there's nothing to see here when I'm seeing people fool each other to build a whole world up that justifies a 5k+ price on something that don't have features to justify a $5 price. In many cases they think the value should be even higher, and are just waiting for it to happen. Does it not make you wonder why that is even with a supposed information equalizer like the internet available to them?

You say you can see a scenario where that happens but you can't elaborate on that scenario so I assume it contains a lot of ifs, buts and maybes. 
You also think cryptocurrencies will become a viable solution apparently without understanding how or why fiat currencies can fail. That's like saying because one bridge collapses, they will all collapse. Nevermind that the collapsed bridge was built in wood and put on fire by humans - the crucial ingredient if you want to fuck anything up.

You're threw it out there without a reasonable explanation and I just said it's not reasonable, if it was just a laugh you could have said so. Instead, you tried to change the argument to something more reasonable, but you're still way off.
At this point I feel like we're going in circles because you don't understand how money gets its value and I'm too damn lazy to explain it in more detail than saying it's backed by governments and gets its value from use. The idea that it has anything to do with the medium, printed or not printed, is just idiotic. A majority of the dollars we use everyday are not and never will be printed. Your money is already digital, that's not the issue. If you want to talk about "money" that's not backed by anything, look no further than your dear cryptocurrencies, et voila, you also have a big part of the explanation as to why the prices are so volatile.

Not just being a cunt, I just don't see any reason why it would happen. It's added costs for no real reason, and I don't see why anyone who earns money would be interested in being compensated in something they have no idea what it'll be worth the next day, let alone the next year. And that's even with you subtly trying to change the premise from "the option not being far off" to "the option not being far off at some companies". It is crazy because you have to be extremely financially irresponsible or ignorant to even consider it and even then the number of people who would consider it is tiny so why would any company spend resources trying to do it? 
I see this a lot here but rarely have the patience to argue. People on this forum surround themselves with crypto news, people and whatever else which makes them lose touch with reality and vastly overestimate the size of the community.

Having a currency that's not inflationary is an idea that sounds great, but it really should make you wonder why nobody actually applies it in the real world? Imagine what happens when you have an asset that is constantly appreciating. What's your incentive to spend or liquidate that asset? What does that do to the price in the long run?
I understand them perfectly well, so I'm not sure what you're referring to. The only problem the blockchain solves in terms of the currency being backed by an entity is that you can trust it (with certain assumptions being met). That doesn't say anything about its value. It's just a different way of creating trust that's more open.
As I said, I do understand the technology, I understand it very well and I understand economics and money as well. I don't think the technology is going anywhere, I think we will find plenty of use cases for it. As a currency may be one but bitcoin is fundamentally flawed as a currency and there is absolutely no reason it should survive to be more than a hobby network unless they can solve some serious technical issues that they haven't so far. Part of the issue is the discussion about inflation, where most people in this community seem to equate inflation with Satan when reality is much more nuanced. I genuinely suggest you try to push the thought experiment that I vaguely outlined towards the end of the first little paragraph to its extreme and see where you end up in value. Then consider what that does for lending, investing etc, and the impact that would have on the economy. Use the Google... Lol
