Yeah I mentioned that the cc hit me with the fee, but they never did that in the past for Coinbase transactions.  Coinbase must've changed the way they bill the cc company or something.  I see no reason why they would do that for no reason.

I believe segit adoption + LN will alleviate the fees / transaction times issue by then end of Q1 or Q2, but even then I do not think that many people will be using it to do many small transactions, because the price is too volatile.  
Pretty much all crypto is being used as an appreciating store of value at this point vs a true currency until the market levels off.
I think most of the "omg high fees" people are just small players trying to turn $30 into $100 (who are the most vocal).  I don't think it's actually as big an issue as it appears to be. 
@_date: 2018-01-07 04:01:12
Yeah, that makes sense.  Agreed.

I go on feel from watching the charts for 4 months and reading news about bitcoin.  I never "cut losses", meaning I have not once ever sold for less than I bought for.  I bet there are times taking a small hit would actually let me trade more and make more money, but I don't spend enough time actively watching the charts or have enough knowledge of day trading to be confident enough to try that.  I simply look for obvious big dips and buy and sell whenever the price goes back up, which sometimes is quick and sometimes takes days / weeks.  Usually &lt;5 hours though.

@_date: 2018-01-08 11:30:14
I want to preface this as I'm a huge bitcoin supporter and I'm just trying to get knowledge.  
I've watched a lot of Andreas's videos about bitcoin being the internet of money, and how he talks about how bitcoin enabled money as a protocol.  He often compares it to TCPIP, and he mentions how it's money as information, and you could do a bitcoin transaction as skype emoji's or in text embedded in the background of a kitten picture.  
That's all great and I understand it and think it's awesome, but here's my question.  
How can you invest in a protocol? I was very young in the early 90's, but were people investing in TCPIP or companies that were using the protocol to do new things on the web? 
I guess I don't even know what I'm really asking, but when I think about it as the internet of money I start to wonder like I guess, "Investing in the internet" or "Investing in a product that uses the internet?".  
Like, you can't invest in the "internet" right? You invest in products that run on the internet? So is bitcoin just one product that uses this new protocol (I guess blockchain?) or is bitcoin actually a protocol? I know I asked this poorly, could someone smart please help me get my head around this!? :)

Yeah, I don't think they will remain king forever, but the way people on reddit talk, they talk like alts are taking over tomorrow, or even in a year.  I think it will take 3-5+ years (probably more in the +) to happen.
@_date: 2018-01-01 15:54:10
Yeah this is a good call, I admit I haven't done much research into this.  My step-dad is a CPA and he does my taxes, I'm sure i will get some bad news in April making all this extra BTC.  
I guess I was assuming since the same amount of money is leaving and then re-entering my bank account that the IRS wouldn't notice until I eventually turned my profits in BTC back into fiat? If I ever do?
@_date: 2018-01-08 12:26:11
I understand that it's permissionless, just like the internet is permissionless, anyone can create a website, post a video, post a comment etc.. without permission from anyone.  
I also get that if you consider the bitcoin ledger that the full nodes (personal people's computers all over the world) host a database, then it's a distributed database in a sense that no one controls.  
Banks also have a database full of transaction records, and it might even be distributed amongst 10 of ***their*** data centers (a building they own with computers they own in it), and in that sense, it's also a distributed database.
However, with bitcoin no one central party owns that distributed database, everyone who runs a full node is essentially hosting the database.  
So I guess you're just investing in a couple records on that database that prove you have "money"? And simultaneously betting that everyone will continue to host that database right? 
So basically that network of people and database are the product, and anyone can create their own network and database and those are the altcoins? Correct? 
So I guess each distributed database + network of people agreeing to run the associated software to maintain it make up a "website" if we were comparing this to the internet?

This is my take, which is based on not much expertise of markets or anything, so take it for what you will.
Price jumps are people buying Bitcoin.  Of those people I break them into two groups.  
Group 1: Understand the tech, is buying to be part of the technological revolution bitcoin started.  These people are less likely to sell for USD profits and are holding onto it until the price stabilizes and transacting problems are worked out, maybe doing a transaction here or there because it's cool. 
Group 2: Bought as a stock to make money on. These people are likely to get our fairly quickly after making some profit or cutting loses (minimally if possible) as soon as possible if the price goes down.  
I think the "real" price of bitcoin is the amount of group 1 people who bought it.  Based on nothing but feel and watching the market over the last 3 months, I feel like somewhere between 14.5k and 15.5k is the current "real" price of bitcoin.  
Whatever amount of group 1 support we needed to get to 19k is now much higher, because everyone in group 2 who bought in over 14.5k-15.5k due to FOMO is watching the price everyday hoping to sell at a break even or a slight loss.  
I think each push to 17k is like "cleaning" those people out and then the price is dropping down to the "real" price of 14.5k-15.5k.  
Once of all of those have cleaned out though, I think there's going to be enough real support to get to a stable 16-17k, which is a lot higher than the 9,000 it was on December 1st (only like a little over a month ago).  I think keeping perspective is important.

@_date: 2018-01-19 12:12:20
What I think he meant was, they are running out of people who want to sell their bitcoins (the atm machine owners), because so many are looking to buy.
There is also a finite amount of bitcoin in the marketplace right now, so theoretically there is such a thing of running out of bitcoin if you had infinite funds.
There's only 12.5 bitcoins "printed" per block reward to miners (Not sure how many are awarded each day), but after you bought the whole supply that would be the only way to get more.  There's also a cap on how many can be mined too.
@_date: 2018-01-30 18:35:59

@_date: 2018-01-08 12:36:58
I do not believe the price of bitcoin needs to go down to the $1 / $2 in order to serve it's original purpose of being a useful digital currency.  I do agree the price is inflated by people who are just in it for quick gains, that's a given, but no where near that amount. 
I believe it has the largest group of talented developers who care about this particular blockchain / network of people running the bitcoin software and will figure out how to drive down fees and transactions time, even at this scale.  It might be lightning network + segwit + schnorr, or something they haven't thought of yet.  
@_date: 2018-01-25 12:42:03
It also costs a ton more bandwidth (which is more of an issue than hard drive space).  Not everyone has fast unlimited internet, and even if they do they don't want their bandwidth eaten up by a full node.
@_date: 2018-01-08 11:58:50
Hmm, I'm still confused, if you have some time could you break your response down further for me?
Something I heard that did make sense to me is that bitcoin should be valued like a network, because it's a network of people all agreeing to run the Bitcoin software (Wallet / Node / Mining).  And any network of people agreeing to use a software is valuable (Snapchat, Fb, Youtube, etc...)
So when I think of it like that it makes sense to me, but when I think about it like my original question I get confused. 
@_date: 2018-01-11 02:24:50
Huge bitcoin supporter here.  Who approves pull requests for bitcoin into the master branch? Like who ultimately decides what code is worthy of being in bitcoin? 
Is it a consensus thing? Like if enough of the bitcoin core devs click approve or something? Or do only a select few devs have privileges or something? 
I've only used github in private projects, not a huge open source project like bitcoin.

It goes against everything bitcoin stands for. That would be one step closer to making an intranet of money, vs the internet of money. 
Bitcoin needs to be able to withstand these types of things to truly succeed.
Out of curiosity why is it so dire to fix the transaction speeds / fees right this second vs in a month or two?
@_date: 2018-01-24 12:57:27
Planning and preparing for scale are an entirely different beast than actually having it.  I'm sure pokemon go devs prepared for it, but they had issues, along with tons of other companies with unexpected scale.  
Bitcoin has the most practice dealing with unexpected scale, and the biggest development team behind it (unarguably if you look at github stats).  
It also has the longest battle tested track record of not being hacked, overcoming attacks, and not to mention being the only coin you can short.  What would the price of some alts look like if it could be shorted?
All of the above is very very attractive to people with tons of wealth 500mm (who have no real reason to take risk), as well as institutional investors.  These type of people (who really drive price), don't invest in anything without a TON of due diligence.  
Altcoins have to overcome all of that, and it's not impossible, but it's definitely highly improbable / early at this point for one of them to overtake bitcoin imo.  Way early, like 3-5 years too early (if ever).

It is, but in the future when TX/s is ironed out, bitcoin adoption is much higher, and the price levels off, there will be companies that take care of everything on the back-end and people will still be able to use paper money (cash, albeit probably different looking) tied to bitcoin and credit cards (with bitcoin processing on the back-end). For them it will be like nothing ever changed.
At first thinking about the above might make you sad, because that adds centralization, but at least it's optional!  If you don't want to be a Sheeple you can manage your wallets and money (bitcion) yourself if you want.  
Right now you are kind of forced to use the third party company that dumbs it down for you, and be a strictly end-user subject to the third parties discretions and ineptitudes.  
@_date: 2018-01-25 11:40:53
I'm not saying it won't be used for small transactions eventually, in fact I want it to be.  However, until the price levels out it's not really terribly useful for that purpose just yet.  If my dollar were worth .75c in 2 hours, and then another 6 hours 1.50 and then another 4 hours .43c it would also be difficult to use to buy coffee and stuff on a day to day basis.

It's almost impossible to lose BTC even with 0 experience as long as you follow 1 rule, never sell for less than you bought.  At worse you have to wait a month and not trade, but if you do that you can't lose.  BTC always goes up and always will imo.

I was thinking more like a decentralized dapp built with Etherium (or maybe with bitcoin as the core blockchain develops) that keeps a reputation of individual borrowers (kind of like a credit score), keeps track of if the borrower (individual) is paying the lender (also an individual) on time, and has options for deferments and what not. 
That way the two individuals can work out interest rates and stuff like that without regulation.  Without a lot of the red tape and brick and motor, the interest rate could probably be low, and no origination fees or early payment penalties.

I'm sure the software can allow lenders to pool together on an agreed upon terms and conditions for a loan, with an agreed upon pool of borrowers that meet their shared criteria. If Lender A provides 20% of the capital, he receives 20% of the payment / interest etc...
The free market will take care of different people getting different ToC and being discriminated against.  The people will only support the lending dapps that have fair practices.  
There will most likely be a way to identify people similar to the sign up process for Coinbase.  If that's good enough to identify you to force you to pay taxes, it should be good enough to identify someone wanting to borrow. People already take out loans right now with fraudulent identities.  
I'm not saying any of this will be perfect on the first go around, but it will eventually all be worked out and be more efficient than the current bloated system.  
It will take a long time as well, fiat is going to co-exist alongside cyrpto for a long time, but I do believe eventually solutions will come out to replace banks entirely, and they will likely resemble online banks to a degree.  
I bought bitcoin because I believe in the technology and don't mind holding it long-term. I only invested some extra income and I have investments in other areas (solar panels, real-estate, ETFs).  
Not sure why the hostility?

If the wallet.dat file is protected with a password, how hard is it for someone who gains access to your wallet.dat file to brute force it (assuming a fairly difficult password?)

Creating your own wallet and keypair is free and doesn't care what age you are.  At that point you just have to convince people to send Bitcoin's to the address you generated.  
You could convince them by sending them money over PayPal or something.

Or you could just use localbitcoins.com like everyone is suggesting.

Theoretically, the free market would work itself out.  Someone would see someone dominating at producing products that everyone wants and getting rich / creating a monopoly and say, "Hey I can do that better, or at least as good and become rich too".
If that new guy failed, then it probably meant the first guy stepped their production or the quality of their product up even more (which is good for everyone), and then some new guy will try to mimic it again.  
That said I'm not 100% against ALL regulation, but maybe it needs to be done with smart contracts and programmed rules based on consensus, because like someone else in this comment chain pointed out, if we rely on elected government, and centralize that regulation power, they are subject to greed and corruption. 
Also, there are SOME things we need government for, I'm not 100% for 0 government whatsoever.   
@_date: 2018-10-03 21:45:13
The government regulations and mandates are what caused the inequality and everything else that this guy hates, not capitalism.  
It's government thinking they know industries better than the people working in the industries. 
Please read The Bitcoin Standard, before you watch this guy and needlessly hate on capitalism.  
All we need is Bitcoin as the global standard of sound money, and government to get out of the way and there will be plenty to go around for everyone, without the government needing to mandate it.

The price on pro.coinbase.com at time time was about $6,419 and they were charging $7,190 for 1 bitcoin.  
It had a camera looking you and asked to download an app to identify yourself using the app if the purchase was $1,000 or above.  
It was pretty easy to use and dispensed cash if you sent it Bitcoin as well as the other way around, gave you bitcoin if you fed it cash.  
Near the lego store (shown in the pic).  
Note* I also thought it was pretty aptly placed next to a way to transfer currencies to other countries.  Seeing as that's one of Bitcoin's best use cases at the moment.  
Edit: Also, it only facilitated transactions with BTC, I looked for other coins.

One step at a time. Something is better than nothing.
@_date: 2018-06-03 01:46:45
Something in the beginning, when I first started using bitcoin, that took me a long time to grasp is, Bitcoin is literally just a file on computers with a list of addresses and amount of BTC so... like...
13089gu2jgwrg0j2  1.2 BTC
24egj02gj028gj42   .5 BTC
woejgwoigjwoijoigj  .3 BTC
So you can create an address OFFLINE using software, and if you convince people to send people to that address, it will get added to that file.  So, let's say you use electrum or whatever software to generate your own deposit address qweriutiweoj892 and got someone to send it .2 bitcoin now the file looks like this:
13089gu2jgwrg0j2  1.2 BTC
24egj02gj028gj42   .5 BTC
woejgwoigjwoijoigj  .3 BTC
qweriutiweoj892     .2 BTC
It took me awhile to realize there's no like "place" you have to go and "sign up" in order for Bitcoin to work or use it.  
I hope that made sense (and I know the actual ledger is a bit more complicated than that, but at the end of the day, that's basically what it is).

I don't think adoption is really going to increase on a big scale until the price stabilizes.  If I wanted to buy a $3,000 car from a dude on craigslist who accepted both Bitcoin and Cash, then I'd probably choose cash, because the next day the same Bitcoin could legit be worth $3,200.  
Maybe if there were some type of smart contract involved or something where I'd get the gains for up to 2 weeks after the sale (so I could still have fun profiting from speculation, but still buying things with Bitcoin), but simply like a 5% discount on the price of the car isn't going to get me interested most likely.  
That's just how I see it.

Download Bitcoin core from bitcoin.org.  Sure, you have to download the entire blockchain, but if you open the right ports and follow the instructions, you'll be helping the network and using a very secure wallet (assuming you install it on a clean PC)

Both your idea and iamjusthonest can be accomplished with smart contracts, which should be available soon with Bitcoin, if it isn't yet already.
@_date: 2018-06-06 14:53:54
I don't know how smart contracts work exactly, but I was told Bitcoin does have them, and that Bitcoin is programmable money, but here's kind of what I had envisioned (I also admit I don't really know how options work).  Maybe you cold tell me if there's a difference or if my way is a good idea? 
Basically I'll have a deposit address, and the guy I'm buying a car from has a deposit address.  
Both of us would enter into a smart contract and he'd give me the car.  The contract would be programmed as follows:
For 2 weeks the car buy's public deposit address cannot spend the bitcoins I sent him (via a smart contract) for the car.  At the 2 week mark, if Bitcoin went down in value, there would be no change, and the car buyers bitcoin then becomes spendable.  If Bitcoin went up in value, some of the Bitcoin I sent to the car buyer would automatically be sent back to my deposit address to cover lost gains. 
Something along those lines, where the buyer / seller agree to it and are comfortable spending their Bitcoin for items without having to worry about speculation and "missing out" or something.  Obviously my example wouldn't be the same terms everyone would want to use.

Do some homework, Bitcoin is not a FIAT currency.  
@_date: 2019-02-24 23:19:30
From that own article you linked:














Of these definitions, only the last one could be argued to applied to Bitcoin.  You could argue semantics for sure and say that FIAT currencies do not ***always*** apply to a state or government, but it's not what the word means to the general population.  
The way 99% of people view the word and it's meaning pertains to state / government issued currency, which Bitcoin is not.  
@_date: 2019-02-26 15:18:00
Probably better not to offer the option at all.  Advanced users can just transfer the coins from the Samsung wallet to their own. That way people who "think" they are "advanced" don't turn off the protection by accident and drop their phone in a lake.

They have the biggest and only important advantage.  Decentralization.  There is literally no point to crypto if it's not fully decentralized.  
Blockchain is just a buzz word used to create hype and get funding, it's not the unique or interesting thing about Bitcoin at all.  
Literally all the solutions that altcoins are "solving" could be solved by any half-way decent developer using an RDS database on AWS and it would be 10x more efficient.  And they might as well to save money if they aren't decentralized, which they aren't.

You haven't lost any Bitcoin if you didn't sell.  The value of your Bitcoin is just temporary less.  If you bought .42 Bitcoin and haven't sold, you still have exactly .42 Bitcoin.  You didn't lose any Bitcoin.

This doesn't concern anyone who sees Bitcoin's true value to the world.  
@_date: 2019-01-20 17:32:58
I feel like it's decently analogous.  
Before email was ubiquitous plenty of people sent email from many places for years, but just like those people, and the people using Bitcoin now, they were doing it because they were enthusiasts in the technology.  
Unless you're an enthusiast / testing new technology your building, there's really no reason to transact right now using Bitcoin because of the price fluctuations and because there are way better options available like Venmo, Paypal, visa, etc.  There are a few edge cases (like online poker sites that don't accept your FIAT) or transferring large amounts of money from one country to another on vacation if you're well off, or a few other legit reasons you should use it, but the average person really shouldn't have an expectation of using it to transact right now, other than if they just think it's cool (being an enthusiast).  
The only real reason to own Bitcoin right now is because you know what it will become. You can see it becoming as ubiquitous as email and therefore it's value will go up when that time comes.  Owning it now is like buying into an email company back when email stunk, because you thought that company would revolutionize the world by making email awesome and fast and it would go up in value.  
I probably didn't explain it perfectly, and of course Bitcoin is not a company so it's not a perfect analogy, but hopefully you can see a little more where I'm coming from.

You're making the mistake that people who feel this strongly are concerned with "advertising" bitcoin to begin with, price means nothing to someone who really loves the technology and freedoms it can give to the world.  They are just sharing their excitement for something so awesome coming into the world.

Chase can provide that same service with Bitcoin on the back-end, and people who choose to go through a backed intermediary for some payments can still chose to do so.  Not everyone will want all transactions directly peer to peer always, but at least with Bitcoin there's a choice.

Step 1: Waiter opens Coinbase app clicks "Deposit" on BTC wallet.  
Step 2: Diner scans QR code on waiter's phone with QR code app, Copies public key to clipboard. 
Step 3: Diner visits gdax.com on their phones mobile browser.  
Step 4: Diner clicks withdraw, and pastes the waiters public key, and selects the amount of bitcoin to tip.  
That's it.  There is no new app needed, the technology exists.  The great thing about bitcoin is that it's permission-less and anyone can already use it.  
GDAX also pays the withdrawal fee, so no one pays fees in that transaction.  
The waiter could also transfer the received bitcoin to GDAX from coinbase for free and withdraw to their cold storage for no fees too. Or they could put in a free limit order and exchange it to USD and put it in their bank account all for free from GDAX as well.  
It also costs absolutely nothing to open a Coinbase account and use their BTC wallet.  
Steps 1 through 4 would take less than 1 minute if all parties involved knew what they were doing.   
BTW: I'm not a huge Coinbase fan, but their UI and fee structure is currently unrivaled. (Hopefully it changes when Robinhood comes out).  
Bitcoin already has everything it needs for peer to peer adoption between people, except people willing to use it for that purpose.  Mainly because BTC's price is always fluctuating so much.  
@_date: 2019-01-20 17:19:29
Yeah, but if you got into it for the right reasons, you shouldn't be wanting to spend it right now anyway.  
The technology is still at the stages email was in when you had to use the command line and emails took 20 minutes to send.  
It would be like investing all your time and money into equipment and knowledge to send emails in those days and then being upset you can't send 200 emails a day through a convenient UI instantly.

They are only faster and more efficient because they sacrifice decentralization, and once you do that, you're better off with a MySQL database, which will be faster than any other "crypto" "blockchain" type business.

I never see comments recommending using Bitcoin Core as a wallet.  If you install it on a clean PC and make multiple copies of your wallet.dat file, you are golden. It's not that hard to figure out, and you don't have to trust anyone but yourself if you get it from bitcoin.org.  You don't even have to trust a hardware wallet company or whatever. 
Yes, you're responsible for your wallet.dat file, but if you put it on like multiple mediums and keep them in different places safely, you should be fine.  
@_date: 2019-09-24 19:56:57
Sucks because right when I clicked it was 8100 now it's 8400 lol

Yeah for sure it's a bit inconvenient if you aren't using an old laptop like I do.  I plug the old laptop into an internet connection on occasion and keep the blockchain updated or need to make a transaction.  I'm assuming however, if you have a decent grasp on basic computer skills this slight inconvenience is better than spending $100 (or more of you lose it) on a hardware wallet. 
There's nothing wrong with hardware wallets, I'm just surprised that the totally free, totally decentralized option (Bitcoin Core) isn't more popular.  
Edit: I guess it's not entirely free if you don't have an old machine with like 200 gb of space lying around.

Bitcoin has a killer purpose: Allowing anyone to electronically send value and verify they've been sent value (on their own) without asking anyone permission.  
Much like anyone can publish a website or write a comment without permission from anyone.  
That alone is a killer app and great purpose. 
Even if it's a tiny percentage of people actually using it for that, it's an amazing tool for that purpose.

Congrats dude, nice trades.  Some people are too afraid to take profits, but it can work out nicely! I would suggesting taking a portion of those profits though and investing and forgetting about them for the new ATH that's basically inevitable in December.  Hodl some, take profits and trade with the rest (I think that's the best strategy, purely for making money purposes).  If your goal is to make bitcoin as mainstream as possible as soon as possible then buy as much as you can and spend it on actual goods and services from peers.

Right now if I'm a wealthy person and want to bring a large amount of money on a vacation in another country, I can either use Bitcoin and pay minimal fees, nearly instantly, or I can pay tons of fees and wait up to 7+ days for it to clear with a inter-country wire.  That's an actual use case, not just idealistic that a lot of people use.  
Also, where online poker is legal, but the third party payment processors don't accept your FIAT, either temporarily or permanently, and you want to make a deposit, you can do that with Bitcoin.  
I'm sure there are other *actual* use cases where Bitcoin is the clear winner or only option in terms of way to transact, but these are two I know people personally who have used recently.  
@_date: 2018-12-06 14:50:43

Essentially, ***you*** (there is no they, because no one owns Bitcoin) generate a private key, which sparing you the details, is an unguessable password, that even an earth sized super computer dedicated to guessing your password wouldn't be able to do it in a million years. 
Assuming you generated that password offline, on an uncompromised machine, and don't lose that password (private key), then your Bitcoin, is literally, unhackable.  It's also however, literally un-recoverable if you lose it.  To the point where some guy who had like 80 million secured by a password (private key), on an old hard drive, traced the hard drive to a dump, and was going to pay 2 million dollars to dig through this dump to find the hard drive, but was denied by the town or whatever.  
In essence, if done properly, it's the strongest security store of value ever invented, but if you mess it up, no one in the world can help you, no matter how much money / resources you have.  
It's both scary or/and awesome, depending on how you view it / trust yourself.
