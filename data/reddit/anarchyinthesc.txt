I feel your pain.  There are many a horror story out there involving Bitinstant.  A few months ago, I attempted to send $150 via zipzap to email.  The transaction failed to send my coins but succeeded in transfering the money from my dwolla account.  Over the next two weeks I sent over 20 emails to their support team, and recieved 4 replies.  I was assured that I would recieve bitcoin in the amount that my order was originally for (10.822), but instead I recieved a Mtgox voucher for my original cash deposit minus their fees.  (I do happen to have a mtgox acct. but gave no indication that I did in the emails.  I needed fast coin to buy during a slump in anticipation of an increase in price)  By the time I got my cash back it had the ability to buy around 6 bitcoins.  Never again.

That elucidates things.  I feel silly for not seeing that now.  Thank you.

Thank you.  You have answered my question and given me peace of mind to boot.

Ill be using coinbase to add and extract funds to and from mtgox.  I've suffered to many bitinstant snafus to ever t rust them with my money again.

Correct me if i am wrong, but it seems that once the market cap reaches a high enough value it would require increasingly more funding to effect the price.  Once hundreds of millions of people and companies use it and trillions of dollars are in the market it would take the purchase/sale of millions or billions of dollars worth of bitcoin to create any significant change in the price.
