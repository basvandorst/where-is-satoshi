Thanks! I used the manual coin selection and sent enough small transactions to sort of clear it up.
Thank you!

The news isn't that bad at all, I don't see why you're all butt hurt. He is asking legitimate questions. Although he doesn't know much about it, that's why he is asking the questions and it is getting explained quite well IMO. Nothing they said was false/fake news about Bitcoin. For example she even stated that "You shouldn't invest in what you don't know". Research before you invest.
Downvote if you will but it's the truth

Yep, I got liquidated last night with $30,000 with 50X leverage on that. Price out of no where went to 4250 and owned me. I was feelin risky and got owned. My fault for doing a long though, I was shorting BTC all night and made $$$$$$. Then I decide to go for a long and lost it all in one go lol

LOL, this saying is absolutely retarded. Just because you have not sold does not mean you didn't have a loss.

Nah, I don't tell anyone about my investments/money to any friends or family don't want long lost friends to try and become my friend again out of no where. I mean I drive a used truck I got for about $6,000. So I certainly don't flaunt it

I wouldn't say I'm set for the rest of my life, $690,000 after taxes is about $590k with long term capital gains ($59k/yr for 10 years essentially). I'm trying to hold out at least for minimum $20,000 again or higher ;)

Been holding 100BTC\~ all the way to $19k down to $3k and thankfully back up to $6,900. Have held most of my coins through mainly every single crash, I never liked selling during a crash for it to bounce right back up after so have always held out since Mt gox crash. (Sold all my coins 1 day before that crash to thankfully)

Yeah... because people know who I am right?
