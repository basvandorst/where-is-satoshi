What does this mean for bitcoin and its overall approval either by a general public or by the financial system?
Edit: there are many institutions that are transnational and they do fairly well in the IMS. Think corporations.

Maybe IMS is not the best example but my questions were trying to pin down the reasons for Countries not accepting Bitcoin as viable alternative currency through such statements as "its a commodity", "it is not a currency" or even banning it. So my further question to you is, "at which institution if not the IMS should these questions be adressed?" 
My reasoning went like this: If countries do not accept bitcoin as a legitimate alternative currency and if countries are a part of a wider monetary sistem then the reason for not accepting bitcoin as a VAC could be in this wider monetary system aka IMS. 
But I see now that since certain countries are more liberal in accepting bitcoin and these countries are a part of a IMS then my questions should be pointed towards particular monetary policies of a certain countries. Is this what you are trying to say?

You finished GEB? Dear lord, this book has been sitting on my shelf for a few years, just staring at me, mocking and laughing.

The problem is the following: on december 2nd I transferrred about 1.8 LTC from my BTC-e account to my Kraken account and the transaction is still not visible on my Kraken account/address. I already submited the contact support form for both exchanges and I am still waiting for a response.
Here is my post about this problem:

Is this one of the solutions: 
What about the problems with double spending, and again, do I need to print some proof of transaction, like card payment, to put in the register?
