For your Google account you can print out backup codes and keep them someplace safe: 
Then hopefully you can reset everything else through Gmail.
But I suppose there is still some doomsday scenario where I simultaneously lose my phone, my backup codes, and access to my trusted computers... I'll probably be more concerned about the zombies though if that happens.
