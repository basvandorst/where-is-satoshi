Where is the guy anyway?
@_date: 2019-11-06 02:47:17
We all know they are trying to cling to power ;) just if there are people in general who continue to support the elite 1% while 99% have to work for them.
@_date: 2019-11-05 08:17:21
He's got about +/-20 BTC so to an average it would be alot
@_date: 2019-11-06 07:34:17
Great that you have found a service that fits you well. There are many out there that you can try like 
@_date: 2019-11-06 08:42:47
Not much liquidity to start with compared to centralized but it's got to start somewhere ;)
@_date: 2019-11-21 05:30:01
They are in power and that is the issue.
@_date: 2019-11-28 08:53:06
You understand fragmentation vs diversity?
@_date: 2019-11-06 03:53:46
Even those European countries, Cash == Paper Money, same thing as I meant decentralization!
@_date: 2019-11-30 03:47:07
You can try StiB P2P, download now the App Store
@_date: 2019-11-02 06:29:13
They play tricks with us all!
@_date: 2019-11-12 03:18:09
Yeah, his $10 prediction and we would love him to make another one or extend his timeline since he's been wrong so many times.
@_date: 2019-11-05 07:03:18
At least you check it out before removal instead!
@_date: 2019-11-23 05:18:53
Many copycats with slight variations without real innovations.
@_date: 2019-11-11 05:59:01
He is not the digital generation so he will never understand and we should focus on energy and efforts on better things!
@_date: 2019-11-20 05:45:11
Should try out other alternatives and that is a lesson learned the hard way. StiB is here to force them change the business model or go bankrupt in 2020
@_date: 2019-11-25 05:39:09
I bet you just talk trash and you don't support Bitcoin like you said/claimed since your portfolio is still all fiats. Too afraid to go all in? Don't be a coward when seeing others so rich!
@_date: 2019-11-25 04:03:26
Thx but that is the only think we can focus on right now!
@_date: 2019-11-08 04:27:49
Yeah fragmentation like Android
@_date: 2019-11-07 07:36:43
Oh ;)
@_date: 2019-11-25 04:13:45
The mainstream needs Cryptos more than ever. Think about 8 billions who have access to the Internet, hence the financial system!
@_date: 2019-11-07 07:39:07
It is a conflict of what you say and what you do since most people say they hate paper money but still use it everyone while you support Cryptos but they never convert any :)
@_date: 2019-11-05 05:03:04
Only 3 scenarios:
\- Sell it
\- Wait to be hacked
\- Submit to governments
@_date: 2019-11-29 02:15:41
StiB is simply better!
@_date: 2019-11-07 07:37:34
Cryptos are decentralized so it is being implied ;)
@_date: 2019-11-05 07:02:36
We will support wbtc end of the year and bitcoin's smart contracts with RSK early next year. Why is it off when we want to support the ecosystem of Cryptos?
@_date: 2019-11-25 05:14:59
You know the story of devs running business, they won't design for the mainstream and that is why it's stuck for the past 10 years!
@_date: 2019-11-04 06:38:58
If you could afford to lose then great!
@_date: 2019-10-15 23:13:46
That is the worst case scenario
@_date: 2019-10-16 04:25:25
They will go out of business in 2020!
@_date: 2019-10-15 23:13:29
I don't want to move coins out, I'd like to continue to trade with the account. Second I provided everything I could plus I even suggested them to do a video call to verify me with all the documents
@_date: 2019-10-15 23:11:47
Love to but others got low liquidity
@_date: 2019-10-15 23:11:02
Still have 2FA, same one like before.
@_date: 2019-10-15 10:41:38
You are under the thread of localbitcoins ;)
@_date: 2019-10-15 14:43:48
I know what you meant but bitcoin.com is all about  bch which is very much copycat with slight variations. I do like diversity but not defragmentation which is real bad for the ecosystem. When you copy the original with slight variations then nothing new because it is a software upgrade away, just too much politics with the core developers right now.
@_date: 2019-10-15 10:42:19
I know it is just there is no better one out there yet
@_date: 2019-10-15 23:11:34
Currently you can still make profits with LBC
@_date: 2019-10-16 04:26:16
They locked up the account even I have access with my credentials, just said I am not the true owner
@_date: 2019-10-15 23:14:32
When you're under google then gg must mean google ;)
@_date: 2019-10-16 23:26:58
Many other better products out there and theirs is the same old like Taxi vs Uber
@_date: 2018-02-23 10:44:14
I am a Pro trader on LBC for a few years with thousands of coins exchanged but this is the very first time I decided to post a Scammer online and write a bit about my experience while I am wondering if I should continue trading on localbitcoins or other p2p exchanges.
I got up to a point where most if not all of my bank accounts blocked and got closed due to high volume deposits plus frauds. 
I did not get an ID of the guy above as my mistake to rush the trade as I always get ID plus selfie. He deposited cash into my shared branch in FL and it went in but after a few hours later he went back to claim he deposited to the wrong account. Ironically the Teller at that branch gave back the money and "error corrected" the deposit. 
I know this kind of fraud back in 2012 but still not much that I can do when Tellers make just naive mistake but they never admitted it. 
While I was writing this I browsed Reddit to read the story of this guy got arrested for selling bitcoin 
For now I decided to temporarily suspend my trading activities!
P.S: LBC blocked and suspended my account as their automatic algorithm triggers a flag of fraud, ironically ;)

Price is back at $20k ;)
