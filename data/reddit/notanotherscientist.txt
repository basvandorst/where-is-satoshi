How much is a pound of gold?
That's at least how I would respond.

This is a smart move. Change it once and be done with it.
Consider that if bitcoin is to truly become a successful world currency, it will need to increase its value (very roughly) somewhere between 10 to 1000 times its current value.
At 50 times its value, that would put it to about 4 bits to the dollar. And if it only increases 10 times its size, it would be 20 bits to the dollar.  Or if it increased 500 times its size, it would be about .4 bits to the dollar.
Consider the Kuwaiti dinar. It's the most expensive currency in the world and it's valued at .28 dinar to the dollar. That's a good exchange rate to shoot for.

The reason I knew it was a scam right away: I don't have an account at BTC-E.
But what worries me is that they must have acquired my email address while hacked into another exchange. I'm signed up to seven other exchanges, so I don't know which one.

Honestly, I live in Shanghai, and it's been a surprise how long it's taken them.
For example, as a foreigner working here (not a business), I can only transfer about $500/day out of the country. A Chinese citizen is limited to $50,000/year. Albeit, it's a decent chunk of money, but there are walls all around when trying to get money out of this country.

This article isn't saying anything about regulation, just recommendations from a regulatory study.
It's fairly inconsequential is you ask me.

As a merchant, I see the money from credit cards in my bank account after four days. With Paypal it's about the same, unless they decide they want to freeze my account for some reason. Then it can take months.
