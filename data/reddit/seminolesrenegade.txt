Yes. But obviously I did not understand the gaps that weren’t addressed. No twitter for me. Reddit articles.   But yes, as crazy as it may sound, I read the articles.
@_date: 2019-07-29 13:15:38
I did not know about this wirex card you speak of

Ohhh, my bad. I meant mining contracts. I do know someone killing it in Paraguay, using complete hydroelectric.
@_date: 2019-07-15 16:31:11
Damn. Game starts soon. Sorry, got one going in r/shittysuperpowers now. But not 27
@_date: 2019-07-22 18:26:56
I talked to a friend in IT. Head of department that hadn’t even heard of Libra and just knew bitcoin was in another ‘bubble’.
@_date: 2019-07-22 12:14:02
Just the articles.  Supposedly started regulatory blessed experiments today. Sorry I can’t provide article. I saw this am in one of the feeds then looked up independently
@_date: 2019-07-28 20:38:41
Yup. But only if someone else, a professional, does the transaction
@_date: 2019-07-13 15:50:21
But why?
@_date: 2019-07-29 15:00:55
Let me guess, I only need to give him my private keys to sort this all out. Entire house furnished for .001 btc. Nice Kharma score by the way. FYI, reddit is more line football then golf.   You don’t want a negative score.
@_date: 2019-07-05 11:59:00
It was great. When a Brit came in the person at the gate yelled ‘the British are coming’ then everyone else yelled ‘the redcoats are here’. One of our British guests toasted to letting the Colonies win. Lots of fun.
@_date: 2019-07-03 09:59:56
You will eventually.

@_date: 2019-07-07 00:09:45
It wasn’t much of a prize. Just wanted to pass some time. Winners were 97, 13 and the Douglas Adams prize for 42
@_date: 2019-07-15 17:28:40
Go to other game. Two prizes left. It was posted 30 minutes after this
@_date: 2019-07-15 17:00:04
2 left people.
@_date: 2019-07-06 08:44:57
Sooo true. Try burning confidential documents. Serious pain. A client once insisted
@_date: 2019-07-15 12:36:14
Deserved. We need people like you in the lounge.
@_date: 2019-07-05 12:16:45

@_date: 2019-07-15 09:49:20
No, I mean price talk and general. They are great at explaining things generally. Some trolls, but the regulars seem to keep them under control

@_date: 2019-07-07 16:17:40
Very smart. I saw someone in here getting an ultraviolet tattoo
@_date: 2019-07-29 11:55:19
I will. Just didn’t know if you knew off the top of your head.
@_date: 2019-07-22 13:48:56
Good to know. I found the articles in bitcoin and r/cryptocurrency that they are approved from today. Beyond that unknown
@_date: 2019-07-15 17:56:29
Yeah, you can meet some pretty decent and knowledgeable people that openly contribute away from trolls

Seriously. It looks like you essentially do service. I just found some good ones on your profile. Bitcoin beginners. Wow. I didn’t even know that existed.   Essentially just an impressive testament to you.
@_date: 2019-07-14 18:34:19
That gets a prize for innovation and application. If you can get support I will sponsor like the ones I do here.
@_date: 2019-07-15 16:57:37
No. Douglas Adams and originality still out there
@_date: 2019-07-22 14:09:21
I do. This is why I use Reddit. Generally, people are interested in presenting all the facts whether they agree or disagree. This has been very helpful. So from a layman’s standpoint this has been a very helpful thread for me
@_date: 2019-07-22 14:32:42
@_date: 2019-07-15 17:13:37
Random. But not one of the last 2 prizes

Above my pay grade. Everyone here is extremely helpful with technical advice. You can gain a wealth of knowledge here.
@_date: 2019-07-30 10:11:06
Unrelated/somewhat related question. Is there a way to mark btc as child owned. (Actual human children) to hold merchants etc to a different standard for transactions?  I know I am ignorant. I understand the macro and theory behind btc, but not specifics like this. Sorry that this is a dumb question.
@_date: 2019-07-15 11:55:47
I appreciate the sentiment but I could go for a nice smooth kiddie ride today.

Me too. Just thought I could try to make people laugh a bit. HODL, pretend not to care about price and still check it every minute.
@_date: 2019-07-15 16:54:37
Oooh. Horseshoes and handgrenades but no
@_date: 2019-07-13 16:35:21

Exactly. More btc for less. Ty.
@_date: 2019-07-29 11:29:12
Okay. Follow up question. If using a trezor, how do I know my address for receiving or sending?  I’m paranoid my tech will become obsolete then I won’t have access
@_date: 2019-07-15 17:46:44
My post just got booted. Trolls.
@_date: 2019-07-30 10:33:51

Okay. Please elaborate. Seriously, I am interested.
@_date: 2019-07-22 18:20:49
Dude. I just looked at your profile. Solid stuff. Very helpful to community. Just wanted to recognise this.
@_date: 2019-07-22 18:19:08
No judgment call. Just a general analogy of two dissimilar things in the same general family. Grain of salt. 
But those are good points
@_date: 2019-07-15 17:44:01
Bam. Douglas Adams prize off the table. Bonus, what should you always have with you?

Holy crap. This is amazing. I will get his wallet set up immediately. Sooo cool. What a great story for his future. His first crypto came from reddit
@_date: 2019-07-15 12:16:14
I have trouble seeing a future without digital currencies. I am going bitcoin will reach maximum adoption but first mover advantage doesn’t always guarantee success. Of course it also easily could. 
Barring advancements in quantum computing or another disruption, I think it will remain in use to some degree. I really wish I could provide more. 
There are many smart people in both sides of the debate.   Not the talking heads, I have witnessed a heated debate involving well established and knowledgable people with PhD’s in computer science and mathematics debating its sustainability 
Your thoughts?
@_date: 2019-07-06 08:52:09
A coffee maker on io purse. Really cool set up. Very innovative
@_date: 2019-07-28 19:47:50

At least it’s ready for next time.
@_date: 2019-07-27 09:27:27
1.  Can you give a summary of article please. 
2.  Is this truly of significance?
3.  What is the general sentiment and utility of btc?
I assume you are in China. It would be good to hear directly from someone there.
@_date: 2019-07-17 22:10:38
Perfect. Ty
@_date: 2019-07-29 21:29:44
Me too. I want to buy a couch with bitcoin because, it would be cool. 5 years later, probably not
@_date: 2019-07-27 10:44:15
Thank you. I appreciate the answers. Any legs to the Huawei crypto story
@_date: 2019-07-14 17:28:49
Getting closer
@_date: 2019-07-06 22:40:50
Someone already guessed and won 97 but you didn’t see it because my edit was slow. But I am fair
@_date: 2019-07-06 22:33:05
Winner Winner Chicken Dinner
@_date: 2019-07-08 21:22:03
Thank you Libra for the input
@_date: 2019-07-14 17:21:29
@_date: 2019-07-30 09:56:49
I don’t mind the grayscale report or the speculation of what it means, but exaggerating and misrepresenting does not help the credibility of the crypto community. Unless a different study, which may be possible, this was a Libra awareness focus as well.
@_date: 2019-07-28 18:32:45
Dude, good luck getting the old guard on board. This weekend my father in law told me he wouldn’t be interested until Bitcoin became secure. This is the same man that brought his desktop on vacation once because he was waiting on an email. Before you ask, we all had laptops etc and easy internet access. He wanted to be sure he got it.
@_date: 2019-07-29 11:42:41
Thank you by the way. You are not making me feel stupid. So, the seed words are universal?  I’m having some difficulty grasping the concept of seed words vs keys. Not everyone has seed words right?
@_date: 2019-07-30 10:17:19
What are the most respected articles regarding timeline for adoption at 1%?
I understand it is all speculation and no one has a crystal ball, but I’m sure some guesses are more educated than others.
@_date: 2019-07-05 10:49:46
I have always broken just a bit above even with mining. My money would have been better used elsewhere
@_date: 2019-07-05 12:38:40

No. Next guess will provide warmer colder clue
@_date: 2019-07-06 23:36:33
@_date: 2019-07-06 07:55:41
The subject is the open use nature of crypto. Insults not necessary. Open exchange of ideas. Go vent in a political r/

@_date: 2019-07-15 12:10:21
I posted this just for the certainty of knowing, but great question. Let me choose my words wisely...

Thanks. It’s true. It was great to find a supportive knowledgeable community. Obviously you get your occasional arrogance from the keyboard warrior, but otherwise a fantastic community. New reddit handle but long time fan
@_date: 2019-07-22 14:52:54
There are many legal papers out there on the subject. Check out google scholar. Or SSRN.com.
@_date: 2019-07-22 13:51:01

33 was warmest so far. There is still the Douglas Adams bonus available also
@_date: 2019-07-07 13:15:51
Funny you say that. Exact amount he charges
@_date: 2019-07-14 17:21:12

Last and best one still out there
@_date: 2019-07-30 09:31:32
‘Would consider’ and ‘ready to buy’ are very different.
@_date: 2019-07-07 13:17:37
Quick question on wallets. I have a Trezor that I haven’t touched in about a year. Does it need updating or will it still work as is. I am terrified of having btc in something that becomes obsolete
@_date: 2019-07-14 17:14:18
@_date: 2019-07-07 19:42:47
Good advice. These are tech people. They requested.

@_date: 2019-07-29 21:46:26
Yes. 1000% better. She isn’t hiding
@_date: 2019-07-06 12:17:37
I’ll be happy if it keeps doing the hokey pokey and doesn’t change to musical chairs
@_date: 2019-07-10 05:55:35
Take a civics class. This kind of blanket statement without any context of reality including a duty to share the burden for the less fortunate is ridiculous.
@_date: 2019-07-07 19:43:51

@_date: 2019-07-14 17:14:26
@_date: 2019-07-22 14:34:16
I’ve done the same. I’m just kidding. Comparing bitcoin to PayPal is like comparing a racehorse to a donkey. Kinda the same. Good for you spreading the word
@_date: 2019-07-28 01:00:09
Do you think it would be decent in audible format or too complex?
@_date: 2019-07-07 00:02:08
Already done. Keep watching
@_date: 2019-07-22 13:53:45
That unfortunate.  I was hoping the stuff I read was correct and thus would expand market. Once again, Reddit is a resource.
@_date: 2019-07-15 17:45:37

Good. I enjoyed it
@_date: 2019-07-12 08:09:47
Anti-Trump sentiment may turn bitcoin into a political statement. Remember, he did not win the popular vote.
@_date: 2019-07-29 21:26:25
Nice. Pure gold
@_date: 2019-07-29 21:21:02
I never saw original. This looks clean, bright and generally feels positive. My first thought was hoping it was near me

Cool see you in there

@_date: 2019-07-24 06:21:37
Yup. I’m pretty sure I know the person. What a great story. English was my fathers favourite language. He would say ‘ they believed it all, they swallowed it hook, line and pole’
@_date: 2019-07-11 21:29:15
Maybe some tums?
@_date: 2019-07-29 14:39:34
Any chance in the next couple weeks?

My problem is tooo much hodling.
@_date: 2019-07-15 13:32:22
I wasn’t addressing sustainability, I was just listening. I thought it was math they were talking about, not energy. But like I said, I didn’t quite catch it but I know they weren’t dummies. 
Good to hear about quantum. Most people I have heard talking about it make it sound like the end of the road for security
@_date: 2019-07-20 05:00:32
I got it. Good response to all the other ones. BTW, I just upvotes everything because some troll just came through and downvoted everyone right before me
@_date: 2019-07-07 13:42:47
Wow. So simple. Ty
@_date: 2019-07-06 23:11:15
But according to Douglas Adams it is the answer to life. 42 is always a winner. But not the number
@_date: 2019-07-06 22:30:33
Heading in the right direction folks
@_date: 2019-07-05 20:58:59
Smart man. Someone saved me when I first started out. Kept me from getting one from my IT guy.
@_date: 2019-07-13 15:50:09

@_date: 2019-07-28 18:27:26
It was these types of investors that said I would be crazy to trade real dollars for ‘magic internet beans’ in 2014/2015. Yeah, I took their advice. I think you should take the downvoting as a compliment. Thanks to their wise counsel, I missed an amazing opportunity
@_date: 2019-07-22 13:42:15
Please make a hat or T-shirt out of this. It is too good to go to just one person
@_date: 2019-07-07 00:01:35

Very true. I attempted to use Lolli but that didn’t work out. They took order then told me that the charges to ship to UK were crazy. Didn’t realise US only. Now I have a credit in the Lolli wallet

Why?  Please explain
@_date: 2019-07-15 17:37:31
I’m on mobile so don’t know what you are on, but near about there should be a way to get into bitcoin general and price talk. Price talk people are very friendly and helpful
@_date: 2019-07-30 10:35:11
Gotcha. It’s tough to determine any source credibility for me. I’m never sure if it is a vetted report or a glorified editorial.  I appreciate the translation

Okay. There is a raw key. That was the thing I was missing. So these people that are getting ultraviolet tattoos are getting the raw key?  Not that I am considering this.

What is the best way to get crypto off exchanges. I’ve read there are charges, can’t you just send all crypto to new wallet?
@_date: 2019-07-15 17:38:33

Enjoy. This was the last run of the game in this r/. Funny people liked it the other times. Got downvoted into oblivion. Just trying to bring some positivity
@_date: 2019-07-23 16:17:55
Damn. Drop the mike. Great and insightful answer. Thank you.
@_date: 2019-07-21 18:22:10
If it gets to that point there will probably be a heavily regulated cottage industry that get paid to do it privately in the same manner. Bitcoin creating jobs.
@_date: 2019-07-07 18:54:59
Thanks. Just another form of adoption. Your advice is gold

@_date: 2019-07-29 11:12:02
Okay. Dumb question.  Are the seed words the keys?  I though the keys would be a long number/letter combination

Apparently some games are coming out that use crypto so it got him curious. He also walks the dog for the chair of blockchain technology at the local university. It’s been a good combo. Congrats on being an early adopter

Okay, I’m in a public place and just laughed so hard. Now I have to pretend I’m talking to someone on the phone or they will call security. 
Your story is gold
@_date: 2019-07-23 09:55:16
But is it zero sum with governments backing fiat or will it start by countries adopting as currency?

All indicators show that a republican victory will either result in the price going down or possibly up. 
On the other hand, a Democrat victory will make the price go up or possibly down

HODL until it makes sense to spend. When Expedia took bitcoin it was better than using fiat for international bookings. It can be both.
@_date: 2019-08-03 17:31:31
Yes, me too. 
Bitcoin is a riddle, wrapped in a mystery, inside an enigma.  
This I understand 100%.

Not a surprise

No, it’s been a while. But yes,I agree this can be one of the more hostile subs

Its INCOME tax. No income from sale, no tax.
@_date: 2019-08-04 10:34:43
This will likely result in downvotes but coinbase and other exchanges are fine. Yes, you will pay taxes on income if you withdraw with profit. It also defeats many of the fundamentals behind bitcoin’s core beliefs but beggars can’t be choosers. If there is no other option, a KYC exchange may be your best and only option. Btc atm’s are around but the fees can be very high. 
Just remember this entire thing is revolutionary. Asking questions is always good and necessary to become knowledgeable. I am constantly learning and do not believe I will ever fully understand bitcoin. Global, market and technological developments make it a moving target. Good luck.
@_date: 2019-08-08 06:32:10
Shut up!
@_date: 2019-10-10 17:26:45
Wow. Decent article. These aren’t usually as well written.

Entertaining but a bit light on substance. At least he shared his opinion.
@_date: 2019-08-04 18:38:36
I do not disagree. Criticism and flaming someone are very different. 
Oh, I am not suggesting we sing Kumbaya and hold hands. I love seeing a heated debate. Without this, we would simply be in an echo chamber as you suggest. 
However, calling people stupid and launching into personal attacks are not productive.  
Down voting and vicious inappropriate hostility does not encourage debate and help us bring new views on the topic in question.
