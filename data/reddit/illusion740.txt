I’m a firm believer get the money while you can. The old rule in life is nothing last forever and if it’s to good to be true then it’s it’s probably not true. I hope I’m wrong and everyone banks. I was in the housing market when it crashed, at 24 I was making 150k a year for literally doing nothing to rags almost overnight. I know it’s not the same but I’m still cautious now more so then when I was 24.

Still disgusts me that bitcoin holders are cheering on a nation of people suffering to increase their bitcoin value. It’s straight preying on the poor to increase the 1% holdovers investment. Bitcoin was meant to be spent not horded and that’s why it will never work because people thinking they will be billionaires in a year by holding out.  This is why I no longer support bitcoin because the 1% killed it. Go ahead start the downvoting lemmings.

I honestly don’t think BTC will ever take off again. I think it was a fad for a bit. Only thing I see BTC being good for is 3rd world countries with corrupt politicians. BTC is very popular in Africa because of mistrust of politicians from the people. 
We have already established Crypto currencies are not as private as we thought or secure. With hackers using the BTC chain they can find you with your transactions and steal your BTC or when the exchanges get hacked. Remember BTC isn’t insured by them. We have also established that government regulation will kill if or when that happens. Also don’t forget that 1% of the BTC community control it. It’s not being regulated at the moment but one law and everyone’s BTC will be worthless as those 1% sell off while you ride the coaster. Then mom and pop who sunk their retirement in it will be screwed.

Nothing is secure on the Internet regardless of how safe we think it is. To render something perfect and not able to be hacked is crazy. There is a reason why nuclear weapons are on a internal network and not connected to a public system. Given everyone access to something is inviting someone to find a work around especially when money is involved. I know my comments would be unpopular to the koolaid drinkers. I support crypto currencies because I do see a benefit but I also see the fatal flaws.

BTC is the Wild West and if someone does you wrong your screwed. BTC doesn’t have federally backed insurance or regulations to protect the investors. So while my bank maybe less secure then BTC, my money is safe because I’m insured. BTC has seen many different scams, hacks to exchanges and a number of many other things. Also like I said the 1% could all get together and screw everyone else and come out dirty rich while the rest pay. No regulations to stop them.
I do kinda remember reading an article about a guy who held a shit ton of BTC. (Fuzzy memory) who was a big player and advocate of BTC who sold all his stuff and fucked a lot  people over for another coin. I’ll try and find it again.

Nothing like poor countries in hurt to jack up our bitcoin worth. Am I right or what! That’s why I love bitcoin we can just be the 1%ers holdoing out and letting those hard workers attempt to get some skin in the game, but hey they will never have 300 bitcoins like us so they will never make it in. God it feels good to be on top.

Yea I was all on board with crypto currency until I could not update my PC graphics card for gaming. Took me months to get “last card in the state”. Also seen a lot of smug people on reddit who treated newer crowd trying to get into crypto currency like shit. The combination of this now I want crypto currency to burn burn.
