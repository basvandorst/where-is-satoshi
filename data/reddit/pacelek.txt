Wouldn't bitcoin poker rooms be target places to use bots? Unless a really big poker site with sophisticated "anti-bot" systems in place accepts bitcoin I wouldn't play poker with bitcoin.
..Unless you want to fund young programers interested in game theory...

Yeah, reading up on the state of bots for limitless poker I guess that they aren't quite there yet. Which is really good news! 
Like you said - although the AI in that video beat those professional players , it has to run on a super computer which is very expensive. There are algorithms that are coming out open source for people to use on less powerful computers but they might be  a while away from becoming a serious threat.
Thanks for pointing this out. I can now play poker without worrying about losing to a computer! (I'll just have to lose to a human being instead)

Ah okay. Nice! thankyou.

What would happen if electrum decided to not exist anymore. Is there a known way to convert your seed into something meaningful?

Monitoring the SEC website for the Bitcoin ETF
I personally am using the old version of the chrome extension 
I've changed my alert sound to [Zhou Tonged - Bitcoin's Back (Eminem - Without Me)]( by pasting the following in the "new sound alert"
It gives me enough time to realise if I'm away from my computer for a second.
That said. Insiders will probably cause the price to move significantly before the ETF approval/rejection is officially announced so price alerts might be a better bet if you want to make the most of the decision.

You won't have any Bcash unfortunately. As you don't actually own any bitcoins, the withdrawal from bitstamp will only show on one blockchain now the fork has happened. Therefore, you won't own any Bcash. I'm sorry.
@_date: 2017-08-02 08:53:43
Have you tried the main wallet? 
They have an osx release. (although I haven't used it)
To export your seeds in electrum on OSX you click 'Wallet' on the top bar -&gt; Private Keys -&gt; Export

You can come join us on and there is also a nice friendly slack belonging to the subreddit which is very friendly.

This might be a good place to start
If you don't want to download the bitcoin ABC wallet then you can download the electrum cash fork (but could be unsafe) 
@_date: 2017-01-16 19:27:48
I can see it on computer.
@_date: 2017-08-02 17:21:36
oh sorry. Did you export your keys into a Bcash wallet ? Or just an electrum wallet. 
You have to export your private keys from your old mycelium wallet into  or another Bcash wallet
Edit -&gt; I read "new electrum wallet" as the new Bcash one. It must be able to read the Bcash chain like you said.
@_date: 2017-08-02 08:48:24
YES! 
@_date: 2017-08-04 23:11:41
Create a new wallet under New/Restore -&gt; choose a wallet name -&gt; standard wallet -&gt; Use private keys.
Hope that helps.
@_date: 2017-11-16 17:48:03
Ah, oh well. No worries

I was thinking 28 diameter. I think we can be more ambitious. But we can start with that if you think it's better

If you don't want to trust exchanges with your bitcoin and use electrum - 
"How to redeem my BCC?
BCC wallets will require you to import your seed or your private keys,
which can be exported from Electrum. Doing so will expose all your
Bitcoin funds associated with that seed to the BCC wallet you decide
to use.
Therefore, *after* the BCC fork, but *before* you enter a seed or
private key in a BCC wallet, you should move all your funds to a new
Electrum wallet, with a new seed. You will still be able to use the
old seed or private key with BCC, because BCC has replay
protection. Wait until your funds are confirmed in your new Bitcoin
wallet, before you enter the old private key in a BCC wallet. This
will protect your BTC funds from rogue/untrusted software."

How do you suggest splitting on the bitmain chain without allowing a bitcoinCash wallet from gaining access to my BTC? I don't trust putting my BTC in any 'new' wallet.

Not that I'm aware of sorry. If Bcash is still a significant thing after a couple of days then I'm sure that easy step by step tutorials will come out. 
Otherwise, best thing would be to just move your bitcoin on to an exchange before the fork. It's highly unlikely they'll get hacked or steal your money if your coins are on there just for a few days

If Bcc is worth anything after a bit, then bitfinex and bittrex and probably others will start trading it. If you want to try to beat the professional traders for the initial dump then either ViaBTC, or Okex/OKcoin (I believe)
is right, you need to send your money to the new mycelium wallet, not import your keys IF you DO NOT want to trust the bitcoin ABC or the elctrum fork ( wallet. IF you don't send your coins to a new address then they might have access to them through a backdoor. I think it's unlikely, but crypto is full of scammers trying to steal your bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-07-28 21:52:57
... This thing is a complete shitshow. I wouldn't be surprised.  I just hope I have enough time to sell my Bcash to some poor big blocker before it goes to zero.

I don't know about OKcoin,  but I wouldn't want to trust ViaBTC with my personal identity (you need passport verification to be able to withdraw anything)

Look, I can't give detailed instructions to every single person individually for their wallets. Best thing to do if you don't know how to do it would be to download an electrum wallet and upload your private keys there. Then follow the instructions. i.e - send your bitcoin to a new address after the fork and then upload your bitcoin keys to the Bcash wallet. 
@_date: 2017-07-29 17:49:05
You will still have your bcc. As long as you have those private keys, they will unlock the BCC on the BCC blockchain. It's possible that BCC won't be worth anything in 6 months. It's also possible that you delete your wallet accidentally if it no longer contains any BTC
@_date: 2017-07-28 20:11:59
What ebliever says. It's not the best way, but it should work. 
"How is transaction replay being handled between the new and the old blockchain?
Bitcoin Cash transactions use a new flag SIGHASH_FORKID, which is non standard to the legacy blockchain.  This prevents Bitcoin Cash transactions from being replayed on the Bitcoin blockchain and vice versa."

Just came across this. 
Step by step guide with screenshots. Different method, but I hope it helps.
@_date: 2017-07-29 17:54:47
That's correct. I think most people will do exactly that. Seems like the most sensible thing to do.
@_date: 2017-07-28 22:17:01
I'm not sure I understand what you are asking. Are you asking me if you should use 2FA? Go for it if you want the extra security. It won't prevent you from accessing your private keys or your bitcoins on the both sides of the fork. (if you have access to your second authenticator that is) 
@_date: 2017-07-28 23:20:36
Yeah, it may be possible to do that. I'm not at all familiar with pushing raw transactions. I think there is something like pushtx but doesn't it rely on blockchain.info's node. There may be a similar thing for Bcash although it's probably too technical for what most people are looking for on this thread. I'd be really very interested if you do end up finding any information on it though!

Electrum isn't a mobile wallet. electrum.org 
@_date: 2017-07-28 20:08:34
I don't know how keepkey works but if you can access your private keys, then it should work the same way. You have to remember to move your bitcoin to a new wallet before otherwise you will give the Bcash wallet software access to your bitcoins. I think it's unlikely that they will have hidden malware in it that will try and steal your bitcoins but better to be safe than sorry
@_date: 2017-07-28 19:05:47
Yes! You should be able to import your private keys from your old mycellium wallet into the BCC wallet.
@_date: 2017-07-28 17:43:41
I think this was also posted somewhere else on reddit. Sorry don't know who to give credit to. 
'*Before 1st August*
You should have BTC in Electrum wallet (Wallet A).
*After 1st August*
Install another Electrum Wallet (Wallet B).
Move all BTC from Wallet A to Wallet B. Wallet A should be empty of BTC, but there should be hidden BCC inside it.
Export seed of Wallet A
Install any BCC wallet (Wallet C).
Import seed of Wallet A into Wallet C. Wallet C should now have BCC amount equivalent to BTC in Wallet B.
From now on, use Wallet B and Wallet C independently.'
