Is that a fork from an Acorn?

Does the wallet type matter? I'm in the same boat with BTC on coinbase. I was thinking of using electrum but will that affect me at the fork?
@_date: 2017-11-16 17:43:48
I'm trying dammit!
@_date: 2017-11-21 00:11:57
I use the blockfolio alerts and it doesn't shut up lol.

Just got to £5951 on GDAX before backing down to £5900. Wonder if it's a mental barrier.

Honestly I believe if you bought it three, four, five years ago then yeah it could all collapse but now it is too big to fail. It's literally a currency now. It's incredible. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:57:41
That's how I read it. Could be better labelled.

Obligatory, when bitcoin is currency, you won't need to sell Morpheus meme.

GDAX is up for me, but coinbase is still dead.

What sort of performance do you hope for from Litecoin?
@_date: 2017-11-21 00:18:35
I assume you mean "add funds". They ask for photo verification the same reason people in a store ask for id. To confirm you're legit.
 So right now you can buy more bitcoin, or sell the small amount you have. Or HODL. HODL means hold and hope the value increases. I advise buying more and holding it as opposed to trying to trade the dips. If you're a complete beginner you'll just lose money.

I'm just suggesting here, obviously if you're not comfortable doing so then don't, but can't you buy a few coins and hide them on paper wallets in a safe  etc until you leave the job or want access to them? It seems alien to me that my place of employment would be so restricting. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 16:08:22
Yeah do it. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:16:15
Yeah, soon as I saw the price dropping I tried to get a little more at sub-10k, but coinbase is kill.
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:04:41
It's insane isn't it. I've been following the price all day. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 09:58:28
Bought at 7500 then didn't have any more spare funds to buy at 5500. Kill me. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 15:42:23
Yes. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 13:00:42
When you've been waiting for a dip since $6000...
@_date: 2017-09-15 22:49:04
Tfw you're out of money until the paycheck at the end of the month, and by then, the bitcoin price will be up. I hate missing sales. 
@_date: 2017-09-08 22:10:33
I bought on the dip and it's gone up since then? 
@_date: 2017-09-08 22:09:42
Coinbase myself. I felt the transaction fees were fairly reasonable for the security and ease of use. I've had no issues either. 
@_date: 2017-10-12 17:14:30
One. 
@_date: 2017-10-19 23:15:14
Anyone think it will dip at the fork?
@_date: 2017-10-14 22:13:56
So the private key on that paper wallet should, as long as the coins in it predate the bitcoin cash hard fork, also have bitcoin cash coins on it also. Currently they're worth like $300 each so you could treat it like free money and spend it on whatever, or HODL it if you believe in the tech.
