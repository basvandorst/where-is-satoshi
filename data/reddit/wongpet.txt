It is not anonymous - it's pseudo-anonymous.
You have to convert your Canadian dollars to bitcoin. If you use a Canadian exchange, they require identification. So the coins you buy can be linked to your identity. Suppose you buy them anyways. You can send them through a mixer. Mixing services can send random amounts of coins at random intervals to randomly generate addresses. Those address can be used to - again - randomly send coins at random intervals to a single address. When the person receives these coins, they'll have to use an exchange to convert to US dollars. I'm not sure about US exchanges, but I reckon they'll require identification as well.
You can buy/sell parts of coins on in person for cash, but it'll take you a long time and it is possible that cameras will be on you. If you try to sell the lump sum, it'll raise a redflag.
When blockchain analysis gets more sophisticated and usable, they can go back in time and mine that data to find the people involved in the transaction.

Internet-folk will get behind you, but you need to support your claim with evidence. Put together an airtight package of evidence that supports your claim.

Gold is a store of value; it preserves wealth. Bitcoin isn't good for preserving wealth; it's too crazy.

I experienced a problem withdrawing from okcoin. The withdraw request was marked as "complete" (i.e., it was confirmed at least once), but it never entered the blockchain. I waited a few hours - nothing. I emailed them, and a few more hours later it received it.
What EXACTLY is the issue you are experiencing?

I think Cavirtex only allows Canadians. Am I wrong?

You can verify the integrity of the ISO before you install it onto your computer, so you'll know that the OS isn't compromised.
Digital security is a lot of work. People have their systems compromised because they get lazy.
