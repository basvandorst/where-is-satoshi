add a space "-w 128"
or try "WORKSIZE=128"

Ninjacoin is PPS, so it doesn't matter if a block is found or not.  You get paid either way.

Well MtGox isn't the only exchange.  It just happens to be the largest.
Also tradehill is also good for USD.
Also the hacker didn't gain access through SQL injection like most people are saying.  It was hacked because one of there white hats had  read-only access to the database had their computer compromised.

my password was in there, someone actually changed my pay address on slush's pool.  But I haven't used my account in a while.

no there's no risk of losing coins, as long as you have your wallet.dat.
Your local client doesn't matter, everything is stored in the blocks.
So even if your reformat your PC and your have your wallet.dat you will need to download all the blocks, and everything will happened even if your bitcoin client isn't running.

6990 if you can find one
@_date: 2011-06-18 21:52:21
New address do not matter, your wallet.dat has your next 100 keys pre-made in the wallet.dat.  So it shouldn't matter, unless you use up all your keys.

I recommend a PPS pool like NinjaCoin.com, or btcpool24.com.
They pay higher than deepbit.

I'm also confused on how it will work.
You say $200-$250 per child board, how many Mhash/s can that do?
@_date: 2011-06-11 08:19:34
They will increase over $30 when difficulty increases in roughly a week

-f is frames. -v is vectors.
This info can be found here:
But I would suggest using Phoenix with the phatk kernal.  I get about 5-15MH/s more depending on settings.
I'm using 6950's.

You can look up all your transactions and everything that happened with that address.

That's pretty cool, I was wondering why google locked me out.

I would suggest having detailed documentation on using how to use the product.  Also how about a warranty?
@_date: 2011-07-06 16:38:11
Where's the math?
I'm getting sick of these arguments.  When everyone shows no math, they also don't include the price to scrap your GPU you just purchased.
Also you only really need to make half of what you paid for your GPU to break even because you can still sell it.

yes but ninjacoin pays better.
mtred = 0.0000257517740857
ninjacoin =  0.0000268593748356

Bitcoin is can be anonymous, if I traded BTC for namecoins, then back to the BTC it should be untraceable to me.
What if someone started a site for BTC laundering service.
@_date: 2011-08-05 11:51:04
I suggest adding original content, because you can pretty much find anything you want to know about bitcoins at 
Maybe something like "the top 10 ten things you should know about bitcoins" and add something such as don't delete your wallet.dat
Also maybe a FAQs page.
@_date: 2011-07-01 15:43:28
To completely say it's not profitable is incorrect.
It would be correct to say building a rig today is very high risk.
I agree calculators don't factor in difficulty increase.
But your looking at it in the short-term.
Say it takes you  3-6 months to break even with today's prices.
Your calculator is still today's prices.  And the difficulty increase will so down in time.

Depend how many bitcoins your talking about.
Since your not informed, I would assume 100 or less.
I have multiple HDDs and every month I'll back up my wallet.dat to each HDD. If your really worried move all the coins to one address and extract your private key write it down, and your public key, then you have everything you need.
Also your wallet will only was 100 addresses or 100 private keys premade so anything after that be be gone forever.
