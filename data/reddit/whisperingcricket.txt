Quick follow up. Some of the info appears to not represent a majority - Here's why. You'll notice it says 'Full-time Employed' Bitcoin users only accounted for 43% of the community. Only 23% made $50-100k a year. 37% were Libertarian. Though a weird way of displaying this info, these figures do make sense if you understand that the percentages are not binary. It isn't that 43% are employed, and everyone else is unemployed. It would have been more like (example) 43% are Employed full time, 20% have part time employment, 8% Are self-employed or own their own company, and 29% are unemployed.  
This was an admittedly weird way of representing this information. If I were making this today, I'd say something like "71% have some form of employment" rather than only include the figure with the highest representation. I was probably trying to save space, and figured people could look at the sources if they wanted to see the full data.

Thanks for pointing this out. I'm the guy who made this graphic (5+ years ago). I posted an explanation for the weird minority figures in my own comment. Good catch.

Whoah! I created this infographic for HolyTransaction back in 2014. It was one of 20+ on various Blockchain topics. Most are not bright pink (hah!). It's fun to see people sharing my graphics 5 years later, if not a bit weird. This data was accurate at the time it was published. I'd be shocked if any of these numbers remained true today. Here is the original in ridiculously high resolution:
