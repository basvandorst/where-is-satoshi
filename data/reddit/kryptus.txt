I am sure that is priced in as well.

Your analogy to the dollar reminded me of something worth mentioning.
What makes the dollar powerful, one thing anyhow, is that it is tied to oil.  That alone makes the dollar incredible important because oil is incredibly important.
Do you remember why bitcoin became important in the first place?  It is because it was tied to the black market.  If you wanted to play on the silk road you had to obtain bitcoin to use.  That is why we are here right now, partly.
The next big jump came when bitcoin became tied with Chinese money laundering.  When that huge market emerged it sent prices sky high.  And then when that market faded away, the price crashed.
Bottom line:  The "currency" needs to be attached to something popular and/or exclusive for it to succeed without any government support.

It does not matter to them what the price of BTC is.  They adjust prices accordingly.  Thay also do not hold the coins, they instantly cash out.  They really have nothing to lose.  It's just another way for them to get consumer money.

Porn is already mainstream.  I doubt the porn industry would stop accepting credit cards and only use bitcoin.  The child porn industry probably could adopt it, and they most likely do already, but that is not such a huge market, I hope.
Still a good example though.  There just needs to be something new and popular that ties itself to bitcoin exclusively.

Because they don't want to lose their hidden nest egg.  Fear of losing money is a pretty powerful thing.
Besides they can go back to well established laundering ways.

The thing about China is that a lot of the wealthy people there jumped into bitcoin to launder money.  That flooded millions of dollars into the market and drastically raised the price.  If those same people in China pull out of bitcoin, then that instantly turns a sellers market into a buyers market because all those hoarded coins just hit the market at once.  That is what we are seeing.  You really have to come to terms that despite all the mainstream ways you can spend bitcoin, it still remains heavily tied to black market dealings.
