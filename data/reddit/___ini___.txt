"it is essential to recognise secure electronic copies of original documents as well as electronic assertions, attestations or credentials as valid means of identity.” (17) -- Official statement form the eu
Sry but how stupid is the EU? This statement from the EU!!! Think about the implications. I say it once more: HOW STUPID ARE YOU AT THE EU?

lol I assumed the whole time that segwit nodes reject non-segwit-txs... thank you very much that defenitely helps :D

That means if this i segwit and non-segwit funds are never in danger, because miners will always mine what pays more regardless of wheter it's a segwit tx or not? That means not mining segwit or non-segwit would be a censorship attack?

- How do you define network here if not the miners? Because AFAIU full nodes would contribute to UASFs (User Activated Soft Forks).
- Or in other words what does it mean that the network enforces segwit rules and why is MASF the term to refer to that scenario?

How does the sufficiently relevant group incentivice miners to  not produce blocks that violate the rule? 
If miners do not mine both, user funds are in danger and users would loose their funds (and that would very likely crash the BTC price immensly). It will be pretty hard to incentivice that.

- Why do people then sometimes speak about MASF (Miner Activated Soft Forks), when miners always will mine both? 
- Does "Activated" refer to that all miners only mine segwit?

So you think that it will stay like that that the old client gets run by the major exchanges? Binance and Coinbase run the old client right?

I thought segwit a soft fork. According to the definition of a softfork on the internet, new clients will not accept old txs. I'm consfused.

You said if the network (lets say defined as users and exchanges) support clearly support segwit, then miners would not mine non-segwit anymore too right, because they would be not valid in the segwit full node?
