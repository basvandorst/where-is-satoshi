captchas are on certain sites for a reason, mainly to prevent bots from spamming sites and whatnot with messages, by filling in the captchas youre enabling the bots to do w.e they want.

This happens with everything though, nothing to do with bitcoin specifically.
If anything, bitcoin reduces the need for a separate banking system because it's easy to carry around no matter how large the amount and can be transferred over large distances without a problem.

You do realize that consumption dictates production as well right? A significant decrease in consumption would lead to scale-backs on production causing things like mass layoffs and bankruptcies for those businesses unable to react fast enough  or that already had significant investments relying on future advancement.

Why? The bank can decide to say fuck you and dissappear off of the earth, BTC cant, it would take everyone to spontaneously decide BTC is worthless for it to lose value. Any gov can start to print billions and devalue their money.

If he owns bitcoin of course he's going to praise it, who could be more relevant to currency transferred over the internet, that alone will likely raise peoples confidence, and the price, of bitcoin.
