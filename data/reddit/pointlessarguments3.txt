I'm trying man
@_date: 2019-07-11 15:44:00
That's just your belief. Having all my investments locked up in gold isn't a good idea either. It's just not a good idea in general
@_date: 2019-07-12 11:33:29
You just said my argument makes no sense
@_date: 2019-07-12 22:29:44
You said my argument made no sense
@_date: 2019-07-12 03:58:21
I'm not the one that's confused
@_date: 2019-07-12 22:33:26
@_date: 2019-07-15 19:35:28
Who is saying it's dead besides need networks who we know don't research what they say
@_date: 2019-07-11 10:12:14
There is always a risk with having only one investment my guy
@_date: 2019-07-10 23:04:30
Or maybe you just want to have a diverse portfolio? It's pretty dumb to invest in only 1 thing
@_date: 2019-07-01 06:47:37
@_date: 2019-07-11 19:36:58
True actually.
@_date: 2019-07-23 16:56:05
So is his mom no longer included in his parents?
@_date: 2019-07-13 00:04:07
@_date: 2019-07-23 18:00:43
I don't think I understand?
@_date: 2019-07-13 14:36:48
People have no agency over their actions anymore
@_date: 2019-07-07 22:28:19
I would expect them to be intertwined when talking about currency, although I guess there are exceptions for everything
@_date: 2019-07-13 14:35:48
The people who took loans to buy stocks
@_date: 2019-07-11 21:54:04
Havibg all my investments in gold being a bad idea makes no sense?
@_date: 2019-07-13 14:25:18
Nah it was nerds running the bank. Don't act like they don't know what they are doing when it comes to recessions
@_date: 2019-07-12 22:15:29
@_date: 2019-07-07 19:13:10
Also If people didn't use Bitcoin, it wouldn't grow in value
@_date: 2019-07-13 00:33:43
No that's you
@_date: 2019-07-17 06:48:41
What exactly is BTC dominance?
@_date: 2019-07-12 00:14:09
@_date: 2019-07-12 22:50:48
You said my argument made no sense
@_date: 2019-03-03 22:25:57
I did 
@_date: 2019-03-07 12:12:12
Why? Used cars are a waaaay better investment than new. 
@_date: 2019-03-31 03:48:48
It’s just fact. Money changing hands facilitates growth. Hoarding money does not, except for those who are doing he hoarding 
@_date: 2019-03-13 00:09:14
Yes, it does mean that. You didn’t even look up reviews from the company did you? Do you take everyone says as truth all the time?
@_date: 2019-03-03 22:25:49
Haha shitcoin
@_date: 2019-03-13 02:42:18
Oh yes. I’m so glad you are getting off to this
@_date: 2019-03-07 12:34:15
I agree with you, I’m not some hardcore crypto advocate either (I just think its interesting) just stating what’s gonna happen to your comment most likely. 
@_date: 2019-03-29 01:30:55
Yes I believe he was joking 
@_date: 2019-03-13 13:57:41
That’s it let’s go back to the gold standard
@_date: 2019-03-20 02:08:41
**parent reading book to child**
“And they all lived happily ever after in a world without fiat. The end”
“But mom, isn’t reading to kids about the wonders of something without talking about the downsides the same basic brainwashing and propaganda that led everyone to believe fiat is the only way?”
“Go to sleep Timmy we don’t like people critically thinking either”
@_date: 2019-03-08 12:39:15
Bank: “150,001!”
@_date: 2019-03-07 20:34:56
Bitcoin would be worthless because no one would buy them for 150,000k back.
@_date: 2019-03-31 14:44:37
No one is spending money there lmao
@_date: 2019-03-29 01:48:02
I know. It would cause inflation you are right. 
@_date: 2019-03-31 17:29:08
No,  it’s clear admission that I’m articulate. Sorry you don’t talk to people that think before they speak I guess ��‍♂️
@_date: 2019-03-16 23:18:30
No but it is stealing money from the economy. The point of money is for it to be used 
@_date: 2019-03-15 19:43:00
What is this supposed to mean. If it’s been around a couple decades that means people are using it
@_date: 2019-03-07 16:15:04
Exactly, if your purchase drops nearly 30% in value just from getting it off the lot, you should just buy used. Buying a couple years old car is much better than buying off the lot.
@_date: 2019-03-21 15:56:21
Okay nigga. I liked mine but whatever
@_date: 2019-03-29 23:50:25
Oh I was unaware how satoshis worked I guess
@_date: 2019-03-15 19:32:02
Yet bitcoin has been around nearly 20 years.
@_date: 2019-03-13 13:56:10
OP doesn’t understand how t works.
@_date: 2019-03-31 00:43:10
Will hodlers literally never give up the Bitcoin or just never sell it for fiat? Because I was thinking doesn’t that hurt the Bitcoin economy to just hold on to the coins?
@_date: 2019-11-30 23:49:35
That person is simply wrong. He doesn't even back his own claim
@_date: 2019-03-01 13:31:59
I guess it would depend when they closed his account?
@_date: 2019-03-07 12:12:31
Holy shit, you are about to get eaten
@_date: 2019-03-12 23:20:31
Why didn’t you do more research? You are bashing on solar panels when you should be bashing on the people you bought from **OR** bashing on your poor ability to look up stuff on the internet about things you are gonna buy
@_date: 2019-03-20 02:10:04
Wealth redistribution is also a fantasy on bitcoin. If everyone that jumped in on it early is just gonna hodl, then they are just gonna end up being the mega rich and nothing was solved 
@_date: 2019-03-31 14:48:50
Tell me where I said always
@_date: 2019-03-31 17:26:19
I choose my words very carefully, I would’ve made it explicit for you. I always assume unless stated otherwise there are situations where it isn’t true. For example, if your cat is sleeping, he won’t be eating the food,
@_date: 2019-03-05 02:36:21
I don’t think any respected anthropologist would brand Persians as semites 
@_date: 2019-03-13 16:22:52
Is there a monopoly on creating money? From my understanding anyone can go out and create a currency 
@_date: 2019-11-26 21:53:39
Cars are considered life investments. Similar to a house.
@_date: 2019-03-15 17:28:36
I never said it would replace it though. I’m saying we should do that so the people concerned about energy use of bitcoin know how much banking uses
@_date: 2019-03-11 00:45:40
I hope you make it then
@_date: 2019-03-10 21:41:53
FBI: you are going to jail for defacing our currency.
@_date: 2019-03-07 13:25:21
Yes I will. Wasting money on extravagant shit is exactly how the new rich go broke.
@_date: 2019-03-13 17:13:09
But what about crypto?
@_date: 2019-03-31 01:02:23
Yah I said world wide stoopid 
@_date: 2019-03-31 14:45:00
I never said spending was inherently good either
@_date: 2019-11-27 02:35:07
So do cars... If you hold them long enough
@_date: 2019-03-13 02:36:29
Such a classic Russian response
@_date: 2019-03-21 16:22:00
I mean old money and new money mean how you came into your wealth. This thoroughly confused me
@_date: 2019-03-07 18:59:13
Bulgaria invests entire economy into Bitcoin. Becomes richest nation on earth. Buys a Lamborghini

I can think of many things that can stop a mechanical bull. A mechanical matador comes to mind
@_date: 2019-03-16 17:50:51


I don’t even expect them to make the last move. The only way the US would adopt it is if they didn’t exist
@_date: 2019-03-07 12:35:18
Yeah it was, misread. Technically though, couldn’t buying from a dealership be considered private?
@_date: 2019-03-15 01:16:49
How much does current banking use? I feel like this would be a good metric to compare it to
@_date: 2019-03-01 03:14:26
What does money you put in a bank not being yours have to do with anything?
@_date: 2019-11-05 02:02:58
You fucked up by playing the **Illinois** lottery LMAO. Did they even pay out
@_date: 2019-11-30 23:36:28
His claims are true though, a sample isn't even considered valid unless you have 1600+
@_date: 2019-11-30 07:45:16
Your only rhetoric is that he doesn't have better stats? Nothing to actually defend your stats?
@_date: 2019-03-31 00:44:29
Saving is not necessarily a good thing. People spending is a sign of a healthy economy

@_date: 2019-03-07 20:04:04
FiAt = Bad (oh and can only mean government money, not an intrinsically worthless one)
Bitcoin = good (and totally not Fiat money)
@_date: 2019-03-10 14:32:25

By acting like a woman. Gottem
@_date: 2019-03-31 00:46:06
Actually farming animals is causing about 20-40% of global emissions. You shouldn’t be worrying about overproduction causing climate change really, it makes up a tiny portion of total emissions 
@_date: 2019-11-26 22:01:08
Most people. Usually it's because of upkeep on the car
@_date: 2019-03-29 21:06:09
But why?
Edit: why is there only 2.1quadrillion satoshis
@_date: 2019-03-31 05:47:48
And you guys don’t?
@_date: 2019-11-05 04:30:28
Oh well that's good. I remember a couple years ago they didn't even have the money to pay out
@_date: 2019-03-07 16:51:38


Hence why the value goes down the instant t leaves the lot. I agree with you on something (I disagree with your thoughts on pricing though) but I personally could never see myself buying a lambo new unless I have some serious cash.
@_date: 2019-03-07 21:58:28
No because the banks own all the bitcoin now
@_date: 2019-11-29 06:44:26
"it is not a currency"
"It is a currency!"
@_date: 2019-03-15 17:09:38
Wow any other revelations captain obvious?
@_date: 2019-03-13 01:09:30
Okay Russia 
@_date: 2019-03-13 00:11:05
Me stupid? You are the one buying solar panels without doing research 
@_date: 2019-03-31 00:52:25
That is talking about just CO2. and only in the US
Animal agriculture is responsible for about 45% of methane emissions 
Also responsible for about 20% of total emissions 
@_date: 2019-03-01 03:16:18
Pretty much, Wells Fargo’s interest rate is .01%
@_date: 2019-11-26 21:21:00
Upgrading a car is usually the worst investment you can make.
@_date: 2019-11-25 18:54:22
If it's 310 million now, it was around 400 million before
@_date: 2019-03-21 15:45:12
What does it actually stand for? **H**old **O**n mom I’m not **D**one **L**icking my plate clean of excess ranch
@_date: 2019-11-26 21:35:21
It is considered an investment to do all these things yes. Anyway, car buying is definetly considered an investment.
@_date: 2019-03-11 02:32:34
But if he actually understood what it was he probably wouldn’t of said that
@_date: 2019-03-07 22:01:11
*taps forehead*
@_date: 2019-03-01 13:35:20
Oh so my man is not getting the $3 ��
@_date: 2019-03-07 20:46:34
I uh... I meant when it gets up to that amount. Yeah... that’s what I meant
@_date: 2019-11-05 19:09:19
Yeah I think gold will come back to value at some point during a post-apocalypse. Probably well past this dudes father being able to use it though
@_date: 2019-03-16 17:49:53
Wow San Marino. They are a major player
@_date: 2019-03-07 12:11:44
This seems more to be a problem with the dealership. I wouldn’t go back if I were you 
@_date: 2019-03-07 16:46:17
Well even a “new” used car will be about 2/3 the price, and run about as well
@_date: 2019-03-13 00:45:30
Yeah I doubt you even know what that means 
@_date: 2019-03-29 01:31:42
It won’t, they don’t have to pay it back until the bonds mature
@_date: 2019-11-27 04:19:40
I mean either way it's still considered an investment to buy a car. Depreciating assets are a real concept
@_date: 2019-03-05 17:08:57
No because that shiny fake coin is FiAt
@_date: 2019-11-11 14:44:41
Fun fact, he is the richest African American
@_date: 2019-03-15 19:37:54
More like 100 if we are speaking in terms of internet 
@_date: 2019-03-13 02:37:38
There we go. What are you paid by the comment?
@_date: 2019-03-20 02:15:23
Not true. The value of bitcoin isn’t dependent on USD and Euro.
@_date: 2019-03-07 20:03:17
You wouldn’t sell if the banks offered you 150k?
@_date: 2019-03-12 23:35:11
You act like you were caught by surprise that they didn’t work that well. If you would’ve researched you shouldn’t of been surprised
@_date: 2019-03-15 20:07:06
Have you forgotten that the 2009s are nearly 30 years ago now?
@_date: 2019-11-15 16:15:05
I wonder why an American payment company wouldn't be that popular in Italy
@_date: 2019-11-05 02:03:33
He said Illinois, not Chicago
@_date: 2019-03-29 23:47:57
No I mean why is the limit 2.1quadrillion satoshis 
@_date: 2019-03-23 16:44:27
It’s just $530 dude. If it was over 1-2k (even then we don’t know the financial situation here) it would be dumb to do a high risk investment like that. It’s really not the worst investment they could’ve made.
@_date: 2019-11-30 23:55:22
They are not considered valid polls though. Just because something incorrect is common does not mean they are valid
@_date: 2019-08-08 18:57:35
No you are stupid because you clearly didn't read the article
@_date: 2019-08-12 00:27:24
No it isn't. It is simply the study of how societies utilize scarce resources. It isn't about maximizing anything, that's the economic system that does that
@_date: 2019-08-25 13:20:13
And? You think nerds created the internet in it's current scope/form by themselves?
@_date: 2019-08-05 23:40:08
Because he probably smarter than that
@_date: 2019-10-02 01:22:14
Sorta is
@_date: 2019-08-23 11:16:19
Are you from STL by chance? That's the only area I know of that calls portions of heroin "beans"
@_date: 2019-10-11 12:15:28
Yeah... **Hopefully**
@_date: 2019-08-06 18:06:21
He get litecoin on dogecoin
@_date: 2019-08-10 21:30:16
What alt are people talking about. I bought $20 worth of ethereum and it's only worth $21 now
@_date: 2019-08-28 00:39:11
It's a perfect saying. You just fully understood the saying, no one knows when the clock is right but if you check later you can know. Just like all these Nostradamuses out here
@_date: 2019-08-23 22:09:34
It's kinda ironic, as that's the reason I got to any crypto sub
@_date: 2019-08-25 14:36:31
Oh okay buddy, keep thinking that
@_date: 2019-10-08 13:03:56
Oh... I thought it was temporary because like when solar flares happen it seems like they get things back up pretty quick
@_date: 2019-06-09 02:34:24
Of course they do they own Bitcoin. Owning a Bitcoin = degree in economics
@_date: 2019-06-16 14:44:01
2030: UScoin. Government owned and sanctioned bitcoin
@_date: 2019-02-21 20:46:32
Which is essentially every rich persons situation 
@_date: 2019-06-29 18:04:13
Remember guys, you haven't lost money until you sell!
@_date: 2019-02-22 18:37:35
Could someone explain to me why crypto isn’t considered fiat? Doesn’t it require the same amount of faith that other people will accept it as currency as the USD?
@_date: 2019-02-21 16:50:17
So you aren’t really a big crypto supporter 
@_date: 2019-06-12 19:50:23
It's only $200k of debt per tax payer, we will just have to be worked to death we are fine. /S
@_date: 2019-02-15 16:03:38
You are thinking of natural rights( mixed with legal) In the courts there is such a concept of legal rights which can be removed. The rights you are thinking of are considered inalienable 
@_date: 2019-10-08 12:31:14
Honestly why couldn't they stop them? Couldn't they just destroy the internet infrastructure if they really wanted to
@_date: 2019-06-25 20:32:10
Yes! Fuck bawston
@_date: 2019-06-14 13:27:17
A lot of millennials have kids dude
@_date: 2019-02-28 03:17:29
There were definitely doubters of the internet 
@_date: 2019-02-22 19:22:12
Oh I get it now. Since there is a set amount of bitcoin, it can’t be fiat?
@_date: 2019-02-21 17:10:40
Any support is good support, especially a big name like that 
@_date: 2019-02-28 00:53:58
Yes. Isn’t that why you are trying to sell the painting?
@_date: 2019-06-07 22:05:05
No crime is high because of all the laws and ability to catch them
@_date: 2019-06-22 08:26:39
I don't see the problem tbh. If they were black it wouldn't be any different in my eyes, old black men old white men, if it is factually correct what's the issue. You guys need to stop being so sensitive about race lmao
@_date: 2019-06-30 17:23:05
AKA "I prefer not to pay for the Public utilities I use"
@_date: 2019-02-15 16:02:56
Legal rights sure, but the natural rights created by John Locke encompass what we need.
@_date: 2019-02-26 14:57:53
Look up definition of fiat money. This is why I am confused and this doesn’t clear up my confusion since it is directly in line with my understanding. It became fiat after it wasn’t backed by gold anymore
@_date: 2019-02-24 00:58:53
You can’t deny for reason of discrimination right?
@_date: 2019-02-15 14:49:50
They ask you if you know or plan to nullify the jury, which sure lie in court that’s smart. It was a joke anyway **ETC LEL**
@_date: 2019-02-26 15:34:57
My 5 year plan is to seize the means to production 
@_date: 2019-02-22 18:47:35
From my understanding, fiat currency is just a currency not tied to something of value (such as gold), I don’t think it necessarily has to be a government issued currency , the “fiat” is the agreement everyone has to accept it
@_date: 2019-02-25 03:38:43
How was the 21 million number decided?
@_date: 2019-06-16 16:26:13
Not me. I have ethereum and monero as well and this is shitting
@_date: 2019-06-14 13:26:36
Honestly they are more of a hastle than anything. I never carry more than a 20 with me and that 20 has been in my wallet for about a month now
@_date: 2019-06-24 22:01:25
Pretty sure they are already lined
@_date: 2019-02-16 05:39:56
They haven’t. Uber is loosing money every year, and their end game seems to just survive until automated cars come (who knows when that is) and people still choose hotels over Airbnb in most cases. 
@_date: 2019-02-28 00:40:43
No. I’m allowed to say whatever I want
@_date: 2019-06-24 22:26:23
American dollars aren't inflationary then. It is decided by how many resources exist
@_date: 2019-02-22 21:21:35
Yes but look up the definition of “fiat money” and it gives a different definition. Which is where my confusion stems from
@_date: 2019-02-28 00:28:12
God, since when did people start using “normies” unironically 
@_date: 2019-02-20 13:49:33
Or maybe he is just frugal. No need to be an asshole
@_date: 2019-02-15 08:46:32
How do we know we can trust that post though?
@_date: 2019-02-15 16:31:48
I know. And ownership is considered inalienable. 
@_date: 2019-02-19 22:37:05
I never nut. My whole life has been one big edging session 
@_date: 2019-02-19 20:53:23


Yes, only $1M
@_date: 2019-06-21 01:46:27
Because the dude you are responding too prefers the ignorance is bliss approach to things
@_date: 2019-02-15 04:18:20
Isn’t this how the Great Depression happened?
@_date: 2019-02-19 20:50:40
How long have you been playing with your junk and only lasting 4 seconds. 
@_date: 2019-02-15 03:17:05
You just ruined any chances of being a juror with this comment so, congrats that you don’t have to do jury duty 
@_date: 2019-02-26 13:47:34
NYC actually has a pretty low cap on the amount of Uber drivers allowed to operate. That guy might actually be able to pay that off
@_date: 2019-06-12 06:45:16
Worst part is that conversation actually did happen.
@_date: 2019-02-21 00:28:39
When you are being preyed on by a government entity you act brain damaged to save your ass
@_date: 2019-02-26 13:49:59
I hate this graph, it makes it look like bitcoin is close to master card despite it being an order of magnitude higher

I think we have the tech for the most part except for the infrastructure in space, and I don’t think there is an effective way to bring material back to earth on a large scale for it to be profitable without an elevator.
Maybe &lt;150 years but I ain’t banking on it happening before I die. 
Also I am open to changing my opinion as our technology advances (or if there are any serious prospects)

Which is terrible! But tbf you can see currency as stock as well. Some people trade currencies like stock

It wouldn't be worth it sure. Maybe an EMP or something so it's temporary
@_date: 2019-02-15 16:54:42
Yeah but the definition of need is an essential item or state. The right to defend your life is a need, not a want. 
Plus it’s not always rational to defend yourself, the captor could say they will kill you only if you fight back. Is it rational to fight back then? It would still be your right to defend yourself but it wouldn’t be rational

They aren't that clever yet own the Americans economy? Okay bub
@_date: 2019-09-21 13:16:42
Dude you just don't understand that a bank can hire people. It's really simple, you just find people who do CS and you pay them to do something for you.
@_date: 2019-09-23 12:21:34
US bonds and USD can't be fraudulent if the government is the authority on what is fraudulent. I think it's a pyramid because it's a top down scheme, the top provides, someone else buys some then sells some to others etc. All the way down
@_date: 2019-09-23 12:32:28
No I'm not.
@_date: 2019-09-24 11:14:36
Yes, I was being sarcastic
@_date: 2019-09-20 16:24:10
Are you saying that a bank can't hire someone with a CS degree?

So what you are saying is, you have no idea who Satoshi actually is?
@_date: 2019-09-19 15:40:02
I don't think they would've . They honestly probably created it
@_date: 2019-09-19 20:31:11
Yeah because central banks can't hire people... Do you think president Obama or president trump are fighting in the wars they have? No they hire other people... You have such tunnel vision bro
@_date: 2019-09-22 16:26:33
There is no evidence that Satoshi isn't hired by a bank. I suggest you show conclusive evidence as to who this Satoshi actually is, then we talk
@_date: 2019-09-21 20:39:38
That they create Bitcoin, get it popular but make it where central bank doesn't become obselete too suddenly so they can also control the new era of currency exchange
@_date: 2019-09-23 12:32:06
If you know be is most certainly not a bank, then provide proof? Bitcoin isn't making banks obselete you silly fool, it is just a backup for banks so they can control the new crypto economy.
@_date: 2019-09-02 14:40:14
Hey that's me!
@_date: 2019-09-21 15:28:40
It's because they know they will be obselete. Same reason big tobacco is investing in vape and ecig products
@_date: 2019-09-23 13:49:44
I care about Bitcoin because you can use it anonymously. I think USD is definitely not useful

Eh I’d say taxing them could at least incentivize them to create less carbon. Sure we do need these things but we don’t necessarily need one use plastics to survive. 
Maybe a different type of carbon tax could be used such as how much a company invests in renewables or something

This means you must value what's under the box greater than $1 for this to work out in your favor. With the amount of incidences where the box was filled with a stinky turd I think I'll take the dollar
@_date: 2019-05-09 14:47:18
You’d hope it would be a progressive but I could totally see it being a flat tax since companies have convinced people that their impact is on par or greater than that of the big dogs.

Yeah he didn't deny that. You just tried to divert the conversation away from the fact that the sheep here got tricked by an obviously staged video
@_date: 2019-05-30 06:15:40
I've never heard the Disney thing. I think the reason it's illegal is basically just because the government says so? I can't find any reasoning behind the law other than some theories I found on a message board. It honestly could just be because the government wants to be the sole authority on destruction and creation of currency.
If you want to read some of them. I don't know how accurate any of them are
