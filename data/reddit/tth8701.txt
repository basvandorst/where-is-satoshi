there is this news 
Overall there are two types of central banks been created through the history. One is by force and the other is by capitalism. The prior one is back by the physical force a government can deploy. The later is back by the physical assets been held. Neither of them existing in the context of blockchain or cryptocurrency world. What we have in the crypto world is network effect. But I guess with a deep pocket you can acquire some physical assets.

there is nothing wrong to have a self-regulatory org, especially came from a business person. Winklevoss twins care more about more and more people to trade bitcoin, ether, or any types of cryptocurrencies. If the technical advance can outpace the regulation adoption, maybe neither self-regulation or regulation can control the crypto. However, I think the regulation will come faster and easier.

I have thought about since the heat of all miner are waste. Why altern the miner's layout to put the heat to a good use. Like this one, heat green house. Maybe heat your house or pot farm.

For a mass adoption of bitcoin, government regulation is an inevitable action. Also since as the crypto market's current size, it is hard not to draw regulation attention. Unfortunately, the true decentralization utopia isn't existing at least so far.

Using bitcoin as a value of exchange indeed is still neat. It just upsetting that a quite few companies that drop the payment method using bitcoin. We need more KFC, right

I was about to ask the same question. Why desktop app. For the idea of mobile version or webapp, I think it should depend on who will your target group assuming you want to monetize your development later on. If you are targeting more professional trader, webapp or just desktop app is better. Don't you think so
