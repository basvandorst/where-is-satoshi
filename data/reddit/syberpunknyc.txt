Not really that inaccurate "that amounts to almost eight terabytes of data containing child sex abuse images, which drove a Bitcoin based marketplace with 7,300 transactions of the cryptocurrency worth more than $730,000 (£569,000)." " The website was only run on the [dark net]( a section of the internet accessible by a [Tor]( browser to hide their identities. It was one of the first to use cryptocurrency Bitcoin to make a profit from children's suffering.

gold is used as a insulator on aircraft and space vehicles it is in demand in the aerospace and digital computing industries if fact almost every smart phone in the world contains gold and need gold to function and of course gold is finite anything that is a finite resource that actually exists will have intrinsic value,  gold is backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government and noted for it worth by every country and society on the planet. bit coin is backed by drug dealers, pimps and idiots dumb enough to buy it the only way to make money meaning real money off cypto currency is to sell what you have to a useful moron. if you believe in crypto so much why not convert every cent of your real world actually money into buying it ?

Gold worth is guaranteed the US government, It recognized world wide for its value and is a physical object,Gold has been used as a form of currency for more than 2,000 years,gold can be used in goods like jewelry, electronics and is in demand for digital, next gen and space tech, the amount of gold that exists is finite,investors can purchase gold in many forms. They can buy bullion, or they can gain exposure to its price movements through a wide range of financial instruments such as exchange-traded funds and gold futures.More "supposed wealth" has been generated by the theft of  various forms of crypto currency that the actual use of it.
@_date: 2019-06-07 19:12:53
 the fact that the us is a largest holder of gold in the world 2nd by only Germany and the Us dollar is the standard that all other currency is valued at and that oil can only be purchased of valued in Us currency "Since the agreements of 1971 and 1973, OPEC oil is generally quoted in US dollars, sometimes referred to as petrodollars."

ok well I know who my alma mater is and I know the quality of my education. I know my contemporaries and what they are saying about crypto currency. I know the world of currency, technology and the global banking system. I know the only ones who are in any way excited about crypto currency is the reddit and 4chan circle jerkers. Finally I know that wars have been fought over currency and oil can only be purchased with gold and petrocurrency or as it is commonly referred to the US dollar. Even if BTC was viable asz a currency it would be buries by the western world  before it mattered
@_date: 2019-06-07 19:02:37
You seem yo have alot of faith in it, If i had that amount of faith in something why not convert all of your capital wealth in btc ?I mean I dedicated my 70k a year uni education excursively to open source in 1996 before Linux was a thing it could have backfired on my but didn't. The reason you dont is because you don't have the faith actions will always be stronger than words. the prediction is that btc has a 0.4% chance of becoming worthless which may not sound like alot  but " In fact, there is a 0.4 percent chance bitcoin will become worthless, according to a new report by two Yale University economists.
“The current implied daily disaster probability is about 0.4 percent for Bitcoin, 0.6 percent for Ripple, and 0.3 percent for Ethereum,” according to the report by Yale University economics professor Aleh Tsyvinski and economics Ph.D. candidate Yukun Liu." "To give context, Tsyvinski and Liu also calculated chances of government-backed world currencies failing (essentially being worth zero U.S. dollars): The chance the Euro would become worthless is 0.009 percent, the Australian dollar is 0.003 percent, and the Canadian dollar measures 0.005 percent, Tsyvinski tells the YaleNews.
So bitcoin’s 0.4 percent probability may sound low, but it is a “massive” risk when compared to other traditional currencies,"

In finance, intrinsic value refers to the value of a company, stock, currency or product determined through fundamental analysis without reference to its market value.[1] It is also frequently called fundamental value. It is ordinarily calculated by summing the discounted future income generated by the asset to obtain the present value. It is worthy to note that this term may have different meanings for different assets.

@_date: 2019-04-25 02:27:09
I think it will age far better than cryptocurrency
@_date: 2019-04-25 13:32:00
I think bitcoin has no intrinsic value, and even if it did the US Government will block it with all of their powers so unless 75% of the country starts using it it will fail we are currently at best estimates at 5% of the population using cryptocurrency and 34% of those wallets being empty at best estimates you have 3% of the population using cryptocurrency, Now that is not to say that I think block chain technology is useless it is very good for alot of things but cryptocurrency is not one of them and is a scam IMHO my advise is sell it to some dumb schmuck don't buy it and unless you have free electricity mining it is pointless
@_date: 2019-04-26 18:19:59

bitcoin is a scam, and if it isn't why is the  Satoshi Nakamoto purposely hiding and of course "Bitcoin, along with other cryptocurrencies, has been described as an economic bubble by at least eight Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences laureates, including Robert Shiller,Joseph Stiglitz,and Richard Thaler.Noted Keynesian economist Paul Krugman has described bitcoin as "a bubble wrapped in techno-mysticism inside a cocoon of libertarian ideology",professor Nouriel Roubini of New York University has called bitcoin the "mother of all bubbles", and University of Chicago economist James Heckman has compared it to the 17th-century tulip mania.Former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has also described bitcoin as a "bubble";the investors Warren Buffett and George Soros have respectively characterized it as a "mirage" and a "bubble"; while the business executives Jack Ma and Jamie Dimon have called it a "bubble" and a "fraud",respectively.
