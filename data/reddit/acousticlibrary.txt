Shitcoins just aren’t worthy enough, it’s just the dust surrounding the King BTC.

Yes I am happy to load up here. It could hit $2800 I would still be happy. As a long time stock trader I know never to go all in all at once but rather accumulate on a weekly basis.

This is definitely not a disguised promotion. They were very big exchange. This attack seriously hurt the exchange, if it ever recovers.

I bet on sports and get bitcoin. I don’t care if the bear market last all year that’s why I accumulate low and sell high.

I think a lot of the negativity is from ppl that bought bitcoin at 19k

Are you speculating another crypto? Please elaborate and tell us why.
@_date: 2019-01-17 15:11:43
Yeah...I also had a small bag of ETC coins on cryptopia that had a hack back in August and they still wouldn’t let me access those coins just days before this more recent attack. This is why I only hold btc in a very secure wallet now.

About what?
@_date: 2019-05-07 01:28:09
Bitcoin outperforming stocks by a long shot. This post is aging very well...
@_date: 2019-05-07 00:33:08
Interesting...the device looks awesome to me
@_date: 2019-05-06 04:39:21
And bitcoin barely moves. Far superior asset class...

I am a professional sports bettor and I get paid in BTC every day zero fees

I stopped reading at “CNBC”
@_date: 2019-05-07 01:21:28
Yeah but ledger and trezor are the two biggest names in the cold storage game I trust these cold wallets more than holding coins on any exchange...
