I went back retried it and it did launch my wallet app this time! Don't know what happened before but it seems all good now. Thanks for the tip!

I didn't hear of you guys until coming across this post. I tried out the web app today and everything went very smoothly. It didn't auto launch my wallet app (Blockchain.info's android app) like other people are claiming but other than that I think your web app is great. Maybe add an option to automatically send the change back to an address after the purchase is made? I know that's a little nit picky but that's about all I can think of to improve it!

Speaking as a lawyer, it doesn't matter what currency you use you can't get around the laws of your country when it comes to running a business. Especially laws pertaining to sales/income tax.

One quick way to get some coins is to sell an e-giftcard (eg Amazon) on bitmit.net.

Volatility is still a problem for the buyers of Bitcoin. No one wants to go through the multi-day process of converting fiat to Bitcoin for just enough to use in one purchase. This could change in the future (perhaps with wide spread Bitcoin ATMs) but as it stands now, you basically have to risk investing some not insignificant portion of your fiat in Bitcoin to really participate in the Bitcoin economy.

You clearly don't understand how taxation works in the United States. It doesn't matter if your income is in the form of US Dollars, Bitcoins, Canadian Dollars, Euros, gold bars, or goats. What matters is that you are receiving something of value. Whatever the US Dollar equivalent of that received value is will be considered your gross income by the IRS and taxed accordingly. You might be able hide from the tax man but if they ever discover your undisclosed income (even decades later) they can come after you for back taxes and penalties.

Another excellent point. This shows you can't really trust a bitcoin note without destroying it to check the private key.

No, that's called tax evasion. Not getting caught (at least not right away) doesn't mean you didn't commit a crime.

You are mistaken. It's actually $5.25 million for 2013 because it's adjusted for inflation and you pay 40% on anything beyond that.

What I believe is right now the only thing BTC Global is is vaporware. It would be eyebrow raising for even an established company to offer laser-engraved crystal wallets kept in some sort of high security prison, let alone a crowd funded start up that no one really knows anything about. Here's how it could go down: They raise several million dollars from initial investors, never get any real products off the ground, keep all the investment money and close down the company. It wouldn't be the first time that has happened. If they can pull it off and be successful, great, more power to them, but until they do people need a healthy dose of skepticism. Especially in these wild wild west days of bitcoin.

I'd say that if you bought some bitcoins and sat on them, and the price went up, you wouldn't have to pay any income tax on them until you sold them like any other capital asset (eg stocks). Now if you are getting paid in bitcoins for doing something (or making money on satoshidice), that would be income and legally taxable. This is my perspective from US law.

Technically yes under US law. When a person dies the value of their gross estate for taxation purposes is calculated as the value of all assets on the day of that person's death. So the decedent's bitcoins would be given a value in USD based on what they were trading at on that day. If the decedent didn't leave any record of the fact he owned bitcoins, and the means to access them died with him, the bitcoins wouldn't be counted in the gross estate simply because no one would know to count them. One of many things that could be done to bequeath bitcoins to your heirs is to include a printed sheet with the addresses and private keys to your bitcoins in a sealed envelope kept with your will. Also just as a reminder, currently if your estate is valued at less than $5 million it won't be subject to federal estate tax.

Look, no one likes paying taxes and no one agrees on everything tax money is spent on, but like it or not tax collection is an essential part of having a government and thus a stable society. I get irritated when people on this subreddit act like bitcoin is some loophole out of paying taxes. It's not, and acting that way just gives bad PR to bitcoin. If no one ever paid any taxes we would be living in a lovely libertarian utopia like Somalia.
@_date: 2013-02-05 11:01:44
I think this will be well liked by people who already know what bitcoin is, but will only baffle those who don't.

Does the Android wallet app you use require you to download the whole blockchain onto your phone?

It's possible that someone just sent some bitcents to the wrong address.

I don't know how it works in France, but in America you still have to pay income tax on non-dollar income. For example, if someone paid you in gold bars you don't get out of paying income tax just because the IRS doesn't accept gold bars. You would have to pay income tax on the USD value of the gold you received. When it comes to being paid in foreign currency the IRS does have regulations about how to calculate the exchange rate to USD.

I made that mistake. I bet ฿2 on 91.5% and lost so I thought (I know gamblers fallacy) I wouldn't lose again for several more rounds. I bet ฿15 and won, bet ฿15 once more and lost :(
Never again.

Just watched his segment. I know time and nerves were probably a factor, but he didn't do a very good job explaining bitcoin. If I didn't know what bitcoin was before watching I'd still be very WTF??

The way I'm approaching bitcoin right now is not that of an investment but as a transaction medium. I don't own much bitcoin but I have a decent amount of USD in my mtgox account. This way if I want to buy something in bitcoin I can quickly buy some bitcoins and use them in a transaction without worrying about the price of bitcoins falling.

Really cool! I know it's an artistic choice, but I would recommend inverting "IN CRYPTO WE TRUST" so it reads more like US coinage.
