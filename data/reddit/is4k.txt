Hey! I like silver to..  but it is hard to use on the interwebs. ;)
Bitcoins have no intrinsic value (unlike some other things)
This is simply not true. Each bitcoin gives the holder the ability to embed a large number of short in-transaction messages in a globally distributed and timestamped permanent data store, namely the bitcoin blockchain. There is no other similar datastore which is so widely distributed. There is a tradeoff between the exact number of messages and how quickly they can be embedded. But as of December 2013, it's fair to say that one bitcoin allows around 1000 such messages to be embedded, each within about 10 minutes of being sent, since a fee of 0.001 BTC is enough to get transactions confirmed quickly. This message embedding certainly has intrinsic value since it can be used to prove ownership of a document at a certain time, by including a one-way hash of that document in a transaction. Considering that electronic notarization services charge something like $10/document, this would give an intrinsic value of around $10,000 per bitcoin.
While some other tangible commodities do have intrinsic value, that value is generally much less than its trading price. Consider for example that gold, if it were not used as an inflation-proof store of value, but rather only for its industrial uses, would certainly not be worth what it is today, since the industrial requirements for gold are far smaller than the available supply thereof.
In any event, while historically intrinsic value, as well as other attributes like divisibility, fungibility, scarcity, durability, helped establish certain commodities as mediums of exchange, it is certainly not a prerequisite. While bitcoins are accused of lacking 'intrinsic value' in this sense, they make up for it in spades by possessing the other qualities necessary to make it a good medium of exchange, equal to or better than commodity money.
Another way to think about this is to consider the value of bitcoin the global network, rather than each bitcoin in isolation. The value of an individual telephone is derived from the network it is connected to. If there was no phone network, a telephone would be useless. Similarly the value of an individual bitcoin derives from the global network of bitcoin-enabled merchants, exchanges, wallets, etc... Just like a phone is necessary to transmit vocal information through the network, a bitcoin is necessary to transmit economic information through the network.
Value is ultimately determined by what people are willing to trade for - by supply and demand.

If you call posix governance of linux! sure there is governance.. 
But in reality I have more freedom compared to the alternatives.
Besides that nobody will tingle with the rules - it would make the whole system untrustworthy. 
It would be like adding auto updates from microsoft directly into the linux kernel.

No I wouldn't buy bitcoin for spending them om grosseries - I do buy them as a store of value. 
A good reason to buy bitcoin is to store value. fiat will always decrease in purchasing power. besides that a lot of merchants gives a rather high discount or at least they could discount the credit card fee :)

The genesis coins are lost.
That transaction (the genesis block's coinbase transaction) cannot be spent.
He can just sign any message using the private key, the message doesn't have to be a transaction.
The first 50BTC block reward went to address 1A1zP1eP5QGefi2DMPTfTL5SLmv7DivfNa, though this reward can't be spent due to a quirk in the way that the genesis block is expressed in the code (this may have been intentional).
Basically, that first transaction just doesn't get inserted into the transactions database. The wallet software was written to begin the database with the genesis block, but not to include that transaction.

upgrade can alternatively recompile OpenSSL with -DOPENSSL_NO_HEARTBEATS.
1.0.2 will be fixed in 1.0.2-beta2.

Ok lets assume we live in the Star Trek world.. You can't use bitcoin because you invented hyperdrive - anyone could travel back in time and pre-mine the blocks.. 
And since traveling space is common it is near impossible to get consensus on the blockchain.

It is not actually the infinite loops I am worried about - it is flooding nodes with:
(32) SHA256 - pops two items, and then constructs a string by taking the ceil(S[-1] / 32) items in memory from index S[-2] to (S[-2] + ceil(S[-1] / 32) - 1) mod 2^256, prepending zero bytes to each one if necessary to get them to 32 bytes, and takes the last S[-1] bytes. Pushes the SHA256 hash of the string
(33) RIPEMD160 - works just like SHA256 but with the RIPEMD-160 hash
(34) ECMUL - pops three items. If (S[-2],S[-1]) are a valid point in secp256k1, including both coordinates being less than P, pushes (S[-2],S[-1]) * S[-3], using (0,0) as the point at infinity. Otherwise, pushes (2^256 - 1, 2^256 - 1). Note that there are no restrictions on S[-3]
(35) ECADD - pops four items and pushes (S[-4],S[-3]) + (S[-2],S[-1]) if both points are valid, otherwise (2^256 - 1,2^256 - 1)
(36) ECSIGN - pops two items and pushes (v,r,s) as the Electrum-style RFC6979 deterministic signature of message hash S[-1] with private key S[-2] mod N with 0 &lt;= v &lt;= 3
(37) ECRECOVER - pops four items and pushes (x,y) as the public key from the signature (S[-3],S[-2],S[-1]) of message hash S[-4]. If the signature has invalid v,r,s values (ie. v not in 
[27,28], r not in [0,P], s not in [0,N]), return (2^256 - 1,2^256 - 1)
(38) ECVALID - pops two items and pushes 1 if (S[-2],S[-1]) is a valid secp256k1 point (including (0,0)) else 0
(39) SHA3 - works just like SHA256 but with the SHA3 hash, 256 bit version

No! it is not likely. If the miners wanted a coin with a larger cap they might have been mining something else... The second the limit is +21000001  all faith in the bitcoin is lost or maybe there come a fork some who believes the limit should be 21000000 and those who want an arbitrary limit .

Rules must be based on consensus! if people doesn't like the rules they will simply start on something else.. 
But some rules make sense to a lot of people. e.g.: posix is a standard that makes it easy for all unix/mac/linux machines to have an operating standard. 
Bitcoin has the reference client(bitcoin core) - you could compare it to posix. 
Even more layman:
You could compare to the method of how we send e-mail - most sane people wouldn't change how it works because it is already integrated into everything.

0.9.1 Release notes
No code changes were made between 0.9.0 and 0.9.1. Only the dependencies were changed.
- Upgrade OpenSSL to 1.0.1g. This release fixes the following vulnerabilities which can
  affect the Bitcoin Core software:
  - CVE-2014-0160 ("heartbleed")
    A missing bounds check in the handling of the TLS heartbeat extension can
    be used to reveal up to 64k of memory to a connected client or server.
  - CVE-2014-0076
    The Montgomery ladder implementation in OpenSSL does not ensure that
    certain swap operations have a constant-time behavior, which makes it
    easier for local users to obtain ECDSA nonces via a FLUSH+RELOAD cache
    side-channel attack.
- Add statically built executables to Linux build

You are forgetting at least one thing.
Game theory... 
If a pro-bitcoin pool creates an 51% attack - then the value drops...
The bitcoin reference clients devs consists of ~5 people.. 
But every change is monitored...
and the power is with the miners.
Bitcoin foundation is merely a coffee/lobby/advice club they have no real power.

The Internet is not some LAN-party you can point guns at! 
No one person, company, organization or government runs the Internet. It is a globally distributed network comprising many voluntarily interconnected autonomous networks. It operates without a central governing body with each constituent network setting and enforcing its own policies. Its governance is conducted by a decentralized and international multistakeholder network of interconnected autonomous groups drawing from civil society, the private sector, governments, the academic and research communities and national and international organizations. They work cooperatively from their respective roles to create shared policies and standards that maintain the Internet's global interoperability for the public good.

The coinbase parameter (seen above in hex) contains, along with the normal data, the following text[1]:
The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks[2]
This was probably intended as proof that the block was created on or after January 3rd, 2009, as well as a comment on the instability caused by fractional-reserve banking.
The first 50BTC block reward went to address 1A1zP1eP5QGefi2DMPTfTL5SLmv7DivfNa, though this reward can't be spent due to a quirk in the way that the genesis block is expressed in the code (this may have been intentional).

I'm not saying that coinbase isn't trustworthy - and if you plan to spend the coins it is great/convenient place to have them.
I know people who have paper wallets - and they plan to wait 5-10 years before spending the coins.

Insures and the Vault feature is something they will provide in the future.

If you hodl one bitcoin in one address for two and decides to send it to a cold storage address the number of days destroyed is two, and if you then transfers the coin to another wallet the same day the number of days destroyed is still two.
Nobody knows what/who owns the addresses - But I guess that people don't send coins automatically to themselves automatically at a large scale.. since there is some risk involved in doing it... 
you would have to trust your python script or whatnot.

Very good question. Double spending is a trivial problem to solve if you are a bank, or government, or any centralized organization because you simply keep a single ledger that is the official ledger, and preventing double spending on a single ledger is as simple as checking it.
Bitcoin is decentralized, meaning there is no central official ledger, and this is a good thing, because he who controls the ledger, controls the currency, and who can you trust with such great power? If I controlled the ledger, I might be temped to alter the values in my account and use my power to make myself or my friends rich.
Furthermore, governments don't like competing currencies, so they can easily shut down such a centralized currency by simply raiding the headquarters and forcing them to shutdown their servers, thus ending the currency. A single ledger is like the single shaft that resulted in the destruction the deathstar: a critical weakness and the primary target of any attacker.
Because Bitcoin is decentralized, it has no central authority, so you don't have to trust some company, bank, or government not to abuse their power, and it is also highly resistant to being shutdown.
Now, being decentralized creates other problems however, which is the double spending problem. If there is no central "official" ledger, then how does the network agree on which transactions are valid, and which are not? How does the network prevent me from spending my coins twice? Solving this problem is what has allowed Bitcoin to flourish, while all previous digital e-cash systems have failed. It was long thought to be an un-solvable problem.
You can read more of the technical details of how the double spending problem was solved here:

Second rule of bitcoins: you don't tell anyone how many bitcoins your have..
The price correlates with adoption. and the price anti-correlates with velocity 
The reason I believe the price will go up is because of the human errors. people constantly loose their wallet or password, this will account for 5% per year.

The quick answer:
If you want to help the network please run bitcoin-core( and run it 24/7
If you don't have upnp enabled on your router - remember to open port 8333
If you have more than 8 connections then you are doing it right.
You can always run some cool wallets like electrum - alongside the core client.

Every time the price has crashed the difficulty has gone up.
The reason probably is that the miners understand that nothing fundamentally has changed - so they expect that the price will be much higher in the future.

However, this link to gold, which dates from the 1920s, was terminated on 1 May 2000 following a referendum.[9] By March 2005, following a gold selling program, the Swiss National Bank held 1,290 tonnes of gold in reserves which equated to 20% of its assets
Today it is pegged: 1 EUR ~= 1.20 CHF

I see it as a practical thought experience......
I have no Idea if it is possible to measure any meaningful distance between a key-pair....
proof of concept... POW:
priv key is only used for verification..
generate pub keys and meassure Levenshtein_distance to 1FfmbHfnpaZjKFvyi1okTjJJusN455paPH 
And you cannot use the same solution twice...
Levenshtein_distance is the difficulty.

The quick answer:
If you want to help the network please run bitcoin-core( and run it 24/7
If you don't have upnp enabled on your router - remember to open port 8333
If you have more than 8 connections then you are doing it right.
You can always run some cool wallets like electrum - alongside the core client.

If you want to help the network please run bitcoin-core and run it 24/7
If you don't have upnp enabled on your router - remember to open port 8333
If you have more than 8 connections then you are doing it right.
You can always run some cool wallets like electrum - along the core client.
I'm guessing that small scale mining is only good for heating but it could be fun and educational.

    That transaction (the genesis block's coinbase transaction) cannot be spent.
    He can just sign any message using the private key, the message doesn't have to be a transaction.
    The first 50BTC block reward went to address 1A1zP1eP5QGefi2DMPTfTL5SLmv7DivfNa, though this reward can't be spent due to a quirk in the way that the genesis block is expressed in the code (this may have been intentional).

The Internet is not some LAN-party you can point guns at!
No one person, company, organization or government runs the Internet. It is a globally distributed network comprising many voluntarily interconnected autonomous networks. It operates without a central governing body with each constituent network setting and enforcing its own policies. Its governance is conducted by a decentralized and international multistakeholder network of interconnected autonomous groups drawing from civil society, the private sector, governments, the academic and research communities and national and international organizations. They work cooperatively from their respective roles to create shared policies and standards that maintain the Internet's global interoperability for the public good.
Even at this point in time the cia/fbi/xxx will defend the Internet, since it is an important infrastructure. Nobody would in cut the cables, shoot down the satellites and fire some EMPs and kill all the rioters to stop the Internet.

line 3 extended:
You could compare GPL/BSD for opensource projects to the rules of bitcoin.
The reason why developers like gpl'd software is that you are not a slave to the software - they are free to do whatever they want. 
If someone changed the rules for how ownership is determined the software dies.. (not really it is simply forked - and continued else where)
This is not communism it is actually the opposite - The biggest contributers to linux kernel are giant companies. 
It is all about voluntary trade - if you don't share your linux patch with the rest of the community you have to re-implemented every time someone makes an patch - so it is cheaper simply to release it for free. 
if you changed the amount of bitcoin that could ever exists you have to convince both the miners and the payment processors.. and maybe people would be less likely to buy it since the scarcity is undetermined.

How do I restore a backup?
If your phone is lost or damaged you can make a fresh install of the mycelium wallet on a different device. Upon startup, choose “Restore Backup”. Choose 12 as the length of your word list, and let the “password” checkbox unchecked, and proceed to enter your word list. This recreates your master seed and automatically creates and synchronizes your first HD account. It might take some time until your first account is synchronized and the balance updates. If you had more than one account, navigate to the “Accounts” tab, tap the button with a key icon and plus on the upper right corner, and choose “Add HD Account” to re-create your second account, etc. Note: This procedure only restores your HD accounts. To restore your classic accounts you have to manually import each key/address by going to the Accounts tab, click the + button, select Advanced, and then Import. If your previous Mycelium installation had a Local Trader account you can recreate your trader account and data by clicking “Buy/Sell Bitcoins”, select the “My Info” tab, click “Create” and select the account that your local trader identity was associated with.

**Spamming transactions**
It is easy to send transactions to yourself repeatedly. If these transactions fill blocks to the maximum size (1MB), other transactions would be delayed until the next block.
This is made expensive by the fees that would be required after the 50KB of free transactions per block are exhausted. An attacker will eventually eliminate free transactions, but Bitcoin fees will always be low because raising fees above 0.01 BTC per KB would require spending transaction fees. An attacker will eventually run out of money. Even if an attacker wants to waste money, transactions are further prioritized by the time since the coins were last spent, so attacks spending the same coins repeatedly are less effective.

welcome to @_date: 2014-12-30 22:47:56
The quick answer is no.
Miners choose what transactions they include! some accepts transactions with zero fee.. 
@_date: 2014-12-15 21:28:34
**If no more coins are going to be generated, will more blocks be created?**
Absolutely! Even before the creation of coins ends, the use of transaction fees will likely make creating new blocks more valuable from the fees than the new coins being created. When coin generation ends, these fees will sustain the ability to use bitcoins and the Bitcoin network. There is no practical limit on the number of blocks that will be mined in the future.

21 million coins isn't enough; doesn't scale
One Bitcoin is divisible down to eight decimal places. There are really 2,099,999,997,690,000 (just over 2 quadrillion) maximum possible atomic units in the bitcoin system.
The value of "1 BTC" represents 100,000,000 of these. In other words, each bitcoin is divisible by up to 10^8.
As the value of the unit of 1 BTC grew too large to be useful for day to day transactions, people started dealing in smaller units, such as milli-bitcoins (mBTC) or micro-bitcoins (μBTC).

3) Use [Amazon 2 Bitcoin]( to convert your Amazon credit into bitcoins
This method gets you bitcoins at a premium as low as 15%, half of what it'll cost at Virwox or other services.

This guy talks about +15 as the limit.. and he uses 100 eight-core machines to crack the wallet
14^54 = 7.7 * 10^61
(10^61) / (1000000 * 3600 * 24 * 365) a million checks per second and it would take 3.1709792e+47(The sun will be long gone..) years to crack.. and it doesn't matter if you can do it a million or billion times faster,
 
But nothing stops you from using both schemes
'0123456789aA1! Correct Horse Battery Staple Correct Horse Battery Staple'
Even if your password is 
'Horse Horse Horse Horse Horse Horse Horse Horse Horse Horse Horse Horse'
I would still recommend that you wrote it down

**After 21 million coins are mined, no one will generate new blocks**
When operating costs can't be covered by the block creation bounty, which will happen some time before the total amount of BTC is reached, miners will earn some profit from transaction fees. However unlike the block reward, there is no coupling between transaction fees and the need for security, so there is less of a guarantee that the amount of mining being performed will be sufficient to maintain the network's security.

Bitcoins are divisible to 0.00000001, so there being fewer bitcoins remaining is not a problem for the currency itself. If you lose your coins, all other coins will go up in value a little. Consider it a donation to all other bitcoin users.
A related question is: Why don't we have a mechanism to replace lost coins? The answer is that it is impossible to distinguish between a 'lost' coin and one that is simply sitting unused in someone's wallet. 
If we forked the protocol and redefined the smallest unit - we could even have the world using just one satoshi
No. Bitcoiners are notorious big spenders.. e.g. see overstock

When bitcoin crashes to $180,000 will that be the end of bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-05-27 14:08:35
Because you want to hold value in bitcoins. 
It depends on what you want to transfer...  It would be hard to make a decentralized solution for nano transactions. 
@_date: 2014-10-26 07:43:08
It is funny that the woman  is wrong...  But anyways it is good to see that there is a general misconception

International wire transfers are not cheap ;)

This is true in Europe...  people from Denmark still drives +300 kilometers to buy beer and sugar in Germany - sometimes people from Norway drives to Germany to buy hard liquor. .
It is simply because the politics/prices are different.

And? They have cheap electricity 
@_date: 2016-06-05 08:53:18
In 2015 was the inflation 7% or 0%?, I guess that both are valid.. 
@_date: 2016-06-05 08:51:45
One problem could be that people have a different inflation experience. price of bacon vs. the price of stocks etc.  
@_date: 2017-01-30 09:00:13
Their block was 23 bytes too large, and therefore invalid. 
@_date: 2015-08-02 12:19:41
So because the key is long it is safe....    
well.. that only applies to crypto 
@_date: 2015-08-30 08:11:09
You could use a blockchain ID and stop making it tied to an identity.
@_date: 2015-08-04 18:20:32
I assumed that the attacker would double spend...  and thereby creating a new blockchain that none other would mine/use.. 
So the attacker would just like to stop transactions? in the year 2040 the transaction fees is probably the only thing that keeps miners to the network. 
@_date: 2015-08-15 19:58:00
@_date: 2015-08-06 12:13:10
The price should double :D given that all the miners always sells everything all the time :D 
@_date: 2015-08-10 13:29:24
This is normal...  the miner chooses what he wants to add.. 
@_date: 2015-08-09 21:09:37
I guess people are trying to get money out of China.. and not the other way around...
@_date: 2015-08-25 17:37:23

I guess that you should only run a full node if you plan to keep it up 24/7...   
Anyways it has a high geek factor to run a node.  
I guess it is better to prepare now rather than waiting until it is a real problem..  hence some loonies spammed the blockchain just to prove a point.

It wasn't +$1000 for very long...  
One of the reasons for it not going *to the moon* is the amount of mined coin..  but it will be limited eventually - Ideally the price will double for every halving  . 
You can setup a dollar cost average scheme, it is rather easy on coinbase.. 
@_date: 2015-08-17 20:30:41
You can't use the (dancard) at any broker/exchange... since it is just as bad as visa/mastercard..

@_date: 2015-04-16 19:18:27
Bitcoin Core includes code which rolls back a block from the chain when it is orphaned. All transactions from that block are checked against the new best block chain to see if they've already been added to a block or if they spend the same input as a transaction already added to a block; if they aren't---meaning they're valid transactions on the new best block chain---they're re-added to the memory pool.
The re-added transactions will not be automatically rebroadcast like a newly-received transaction, but if a remote peer sends the mempool message to the local peer, the local peer will tell the remote peer about the transaction (using a standard inventory).

1. Shutdown the core.
2. drag 'n' drop / overwrite the wallet.dat.
3. Start the core
I would make a backup of everything(all wallet.dat -  in case you overwrite the wrong wallet)

True. But It would be at least 50 btc - unless he wanted to pay a 49 btc miners fee.

Here's a roundabout method, but it'll work:
1) Buy an Amazon Gift Card from Gyft using PayPal to pay
2) Apply gift card to your Amazon account
3) Use Amazon 2 Bitcoin to convert your Amazon credit into bitcoins
This method gets you bitcoins at a premium as low as 15%, half of what it'll cost at Virwox or other services.
But really; it is much better to use a credit card or a wire transfer;  use circle or coinbase

The opposite is true.
E-gold could not be held because someone else could transact your e-gold without your permission.
Bitcoin is held by the person(s) that has the private key(this is just a string of numbers). With this private key you can sign the transaction for the public key.  Nobody can move your coins without the private key.

Ok. bitcoins is the only truly free market.
No they can't buy them all.
They can buy lets say 100K btc and sure it is a problem...
But there are 10000000 coins waiting to be mined.
One thing for sure mt.gox is going to be rich if someone keep buying and selling 100000btc everyday.

small amounts to day but big tomorrow measured in fiat ;)
@_date: 2013-11-03 21:59:03
$17123000000000/144000xbt   =   $118,909,722
So when every bitcoin is worth ~$120,000,000 then the usa can pay its debt......
Given that they stopped borrowing now.....    
@_date: 2013-05-02 13:43:07

You are not really buying anything with them... it is more like a token of appreciation - dogers are crazy tippers...  there was some stats where ~$8000000 already have tippet... that is crazy when you consider that the coin is very new..
But sure - it won't surpass bitcoins.

1. No: the bitcoin protocol has been read by a lot of clever people - and no single individual or group is controlling it.
2. My guess is that 25% is lost, and at least 1% per year will be lost(And this is not a problem).
3. so 14 nm asic?  anyone with a ridiculous amount of money can destroy anything.. But it is expensive to do! even for the government.
4. 8 Windmills can power the network...  but if the question is return on investment on ASIC; the answer is: maybe; since it is impossible to calculate, all ASICs are only pre-orderable, except for novelty mining.

I am sure your investment will payoff in the long run.
There is a lot of negative talk in this thread.
I would just like to congratulate you on your purchase.
I am not poor, so I keep my savings account/wallet on a laptop that never goes on the Internet or is used, unless I need to withdraw bitcoins. The laptop has a full client bitcoin-QT(I don't trust anyone with my money).
Just remember to backup that wallet.dat in more than one location. And write down the pass phrase and keep it in multiple locations as well(maybe write down a short note for the family, don't tell them about the purchase that could be dangerous)

@_date: 2013-05-20 18:26:47
Nothing, no.
But one thing bitcoin did that is nearly impossible to redo is reach a critical amount of computational power. 51% attack is nearly impossible at this point for anyone outside the community.
Therefore bitcoin is the de facto standard. I would argue that the crypto currency with the largest computational power is the one with the highest value. 
You cannot force someone to accept feathercoin just because they accept bitcoins - therefor it is about making a community around the currency that gives it value, not the currency itself.
@_date: 2013-03-09 20:58:25
Hey I am as much an atheist as the next guy..
But the bible does give some good financial advice - like:
* Always pay your debt.
* Never get into debt.
* Never give high interest rate to your brother.
Is this about bitcoins(Corinthians 3:12 - 3:14):
* 12 Now if any man build upon this foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble;
* 13 Every man's work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire shall try every man's work of what sort it is.
* 14 If any man's work abide which he hath built thereupon, he shall receive a reward.
My interpretation:
* 12 - Now if any man build upon this foundation a store of value;
* 13 - Every man's transaction shall be stored in a block: for the chain shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by the hash rate; and the hash rate shall try every man's work of what sort it is.
* 14 - If any man's hash rate abide which block a man hath built thereupon, he shall receive a reward(the fees).

Show me the law!
Karl-Friedrich_Lenz :
This is an interesting test case. Let's look at it in some detail:
due to lack of existing applicable laws, capital controls
Obviously, something can't be illegal because there is no law. To make some act or other illegal, you need a law that says so. This is common sense, but also a principle of international human rights law.
Article 11, Paragraph 2, Universal Declaration of Human Rights:
(2) No one shall be held guilty of any penal offence on account of any act or omission which did not constitute a penal offence, under national or international law, at the time when it was committed.
Article 39 of the Thai Constitution gives the same guarantee.
Since a "lack of laws" can't make Bitcoin illegal, that leaves "capital controls".
I have no idea what the Thai law on capital controls may be. But capital controls generally restrict the international flow of funds.
Therefore, it may possibly violate such a statute to transfer funds using Bitcoin from Thailand to another country, bypassing the controls.
However, most of the acts described as illegal in the post don't necessarily involve moving funds into or out of the country.

You will never know where the bottom is - the worst you could do is to cash out at the bottom - that is how noobs looses.

Are you talking about: 
Bitcoin makes these attacks more difficult by only making an outbound connection to one IP address per /16 (x.y.0.0). Incoming connections are unlimited and unregulated, but this is generally only a problem in the anonymity case, where you're probably already unable to accept incoming connections.
Looking for suspiciously low network hash-rates may help prevent the second one.

The money was a payment by a Danish businessman for a batch of Cuban cigars previously imported to Germany by a German supplier. As justification for the seizure, the U.S. Treasury has stated that the Danish businessman has violated the United States embargo against Cuba"

If two bitcoiners wants to exchange some small amounts of satoshis between them.. They can do so free and instantly if they both uses coinbase. 
But then again - it could lead to fractional reserve banking... 
Therefore this should only be done with /checking account/ size transaction size and not for buying a house etc..

wtf I didn't believe you... but it is true
    Although called "bulletproof," bullet-resistant vests will not prevent you from feeling the concussive impact of a bullet striking the vest.
    The U.S. State Department requires an export permit obtained through its Bureau of Industry and Security before Level III and Level IV hard body armor can be shipped outside the country. Processing of this permit may take anywhere from 3 weeks and 2 months.
    Some jurisdictions prohibit the sale of body armor to civilians altogether or to civilians only on a face-to-face basis. Check with the laws of your state or country before you purchase a bulletproof vest.
    You cannot buy body armor of any sort if you have been convicted of a felony.

I think it is great and the price is very competitive.
@_date: 2013-05-20 17:53:19
Personally: both, I would wait a day or maybe a week with gold though, since it is harder to sell.
Keep in mind that I am a  silverbug. but for some reason my drunken brain tells that if it near or below mining price then you should buy, the only problem with gold; is that china and Russia are the only giants interested in gold - gold is the money of kings, whereas silver is for everyone else.
You should always buy bitcoins - I see it as stocks in apple/MS in the year 1980. I even believe that the price of a million dollars per coin is an understatement since ~7% of all coins probably will be lost every year and the coin amount in circulation will continue to be smaller numerically but much higher in terms of real value.
 - So due to lost coins the value will double every ten years.
 - Since more people starts to hoard it or simply save instead of spending it - the price goes up.

There is a lot of positive news at the moment, and there is not a big bulk of sell orders.
If people continue to use bitcoin and I guess they do, and if  people continue to store them insecurely(I guess that ~5% is lost per year) - then the price can in my opinion mostly only go up over time.

"the prices of all cryptocurrencies will trend towards zero in the long term"  I agree! but it is the very long term - Now is the time to shine for bitcoins. 
"Imagine, bitcoin..........."
I think the flaw is: we live in a world where goods and service legally can pass national borders, and having a worldly accepted alt-currency has some value.

If people like satoshi and Winklevoss haven't taken a large portion of the bitcoins it would still be worthless - hoarding is a good thing! at the moment they took their fair share, it was extremely risky and their reward shall be extreme. 
Winklevoss could make the bitcoin worlds greatest sell wall that might bring some boring prices for a while.

information = money and vice versa.
Banning bitcoins is unconstitutional:
Either you have the internet with everything or you have nothing! you cannot effectively ban any protocol or information on the internet.

But at the last fork 
It was the pools that should switch client ver.
The only thing network nodes does is propagating transactions - it is the miners that keep the integrity(validating the transaction). 
You could still send transaction based on the old rules it is just not ~certain that a miner accepts it.

Money by themselves does not keep the society running.... it hasn't done for a 100 years..
At the moment the whole world rely on debt, and debt based IOUs to transact - hopefully this will change over the next 10 years - I think the best bet is bitcoin.

LTC tries to make the argument that it is safer.. but it really comes down to hashing power - the biggest is the safest. 
But if you only mine for profit then might be a good idea to mine alt-coins - but the value of the coins may vary even more than bitcoins.
I would rather hold bitcoins than a lot of crazy alt-coins. 
But some alt-coin are cool like primecoin where there is a somewhat purpose with the mining other and securing the network...

Maybe someone has reduced the time it takes to break it from 100 billion years to 50 billion years, but it would only be theoretical possible to break it.

"Zerocoin is not intended as a replacement for Bitcoin. It's actually a separate anonymous currency that's designed to live side-by-side with Bitcoin on the same block chain. **Zerocoins are fully exchangeable on a one-to-one basis with bitcoins**, which means (in principle) you can use them with existing merchants.
