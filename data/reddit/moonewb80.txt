Why not?  It's the truth.  Tons of companies use Bitpay. They collect dollars.  99% of whatever is spent.  Bitpay keeps 1%

I've been involved with Bitcoin since 2015.  I've used Blockchain.info just as long. 
Please provide more details .....
1....why is this wallet bad?  Need a good reason to switch after three excellent years of service.  Keep in mind, I am a principled person and will switch if my values say I should.  
2....what is an alternative that allows you to separate multiple wallets in the same account and generate 10 addresses for each wallet if so needed?   
The alternative must also require ZERO personal information as Blockchain.info asks for nothing but an email.  And for such an email I  create a new Protonmail email for free.  Thus separating myself even more so from the account.  
I'm honestly curious and I'm obviously not the only one who wants to know why to dislike since this is the most popular wallet in the Bitcoin ecosystem.  
*Edit:  So many downvotes for asking for info.  Why?*

Please don't make this a Republican vs Democratic thing. 
We need to support any politico that is willing to keep crypto legal and the tax as simple as possible.

Bitpay collects the Crypto and pays 99% in fiat immediately.

As someone who grew up in the United States and lives in the third world I fully support this. 
However ... to get someone whose lived in any Nordic country to agree with this seems like a difficult assignment.  
Maybe I'm being prejudiced but nordic people love their governments and hate cash. No?

Not an option for me but TY

Horrible. Let this be a lesson for anyone who thinks we don't care what governments do. We don't need governments to help but we need them not to stifle bitcoin. 
Imagine Bitcoin in the United States without Coinbase, or Kraken or Gemini?  That's what the Indians are experiencing right now.  
Yes, yes yes ..... Bitcoin will survive either way, but the ecosystem would be much smaller, price drop of 90%, and adoption backwards years if not forever.  
Everyone must stay vigilant.

Banks in the United States used to print their own money in the 19th century.  Funny but we're going back there and soon every bank will again make their own money.  
Starting with the GeminiDollar and CircleDollar but the big boys will get into the action soon.

Cryptomixer.io did these stop working?
@_date: 2018-09-23 16:02:04
Not sure what you're saying.  I'm saying there's at least in congressman in the United States that wants to make Bitcoin illegal.

Banks immediately sold the mortgages in packages so only the investor of this mortgage package cared if it got paid.  
But it was win/win for those investors and tie/lose for tax payers. 
**Scenario  .... people pay back their mortgages and investors make their high interest
**Scenario  .... housing market collapses and no one pays back but the government bails you out anyways.

How do you think 2008 happened?  That is exactly what happened

Remember guys.  No keys = no Bitcoin and this company does not allow you to hold your own keys.  
 
Until they change this policy I'd recommend staying away.

Super well said.  We need to bring Bitcoin back to its roots. 
*This is coming from an early adopter that has benefited greatly*.

Everyone should read this article.  Super well read and absolutely excellent points.   
Makes me feel better to know there's people like Ian *(the author)* out there fighting for justice and spreading the good news.

This means nothing.  Iran makes up a fake exchange rate.  So if you're in the government and can get said fake extrange rate you get rich.  You don't need to buy bitcoin.  
The price displayed is the black market *(aka real)* price.

Can we focus on the message for 5mins without killing the messenger?  
I don't care who has a good idea.  If it's the right path forward than we should listen.

This is exactly what we need

How is this not the number one sticky post today. This is absolutely disgusting and goes against everything we've supported for years.  
How can someone even utter this incoherent nonsense???

**Just got my money out.**  Withdrawal 0.8 Bitcoin at a time as anything under 1 bitcoin doesn't set off their autonomous system and then brings in the questions.  
Anyone depositing at HitBTC with so many stories like this out there is nuts.

There used to be a Bitcoin Facet that anyone could click a button and get 5 free bitcoins.  That's shows a community working hard to get Bitcoin in the hands in as many people as possible.  
But the runs of 2013 and 2017 diversified us much more by the price spiked by getting the early adopters to sell.  
Bitcoin is definitely the most diversified of all the crypto. That doesn't mean it's perfect and doesn't mean we can't get better.  
But we've got a great start and hopefully will only get better the more people who join our ecosystem.

Bitpay works with a lot of title companies to transfer the Bitcoin into cash and then it's like a normal deal. 
The seller doesn't even know its Bitcoin. *(except for the 1% fee Bitpay charges)*

And its working
