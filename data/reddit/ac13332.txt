It would depend on how much you transfer. Most people transfer relatively round numbers. Sometimes I go to more decimal places to leave a nice round number balance in my wallet. Just a curiosity, the total amount across the blockchain could be worth millions.

If you transferred 0.458531039 Bitcoin to Coinfloor (and many other exchanges), the balance would show as 0.4585, despite the wallet address having a balance of 0.458531039.
When withdrawing, you can choose how much to withdraw to 4 decimal places. So if you typed in 0.4585 - what happens to the remaining 0.000031039 in the wallet?
Does that make sense to you now?

I'd be very surprised if they immediately supported it. 
My plan is to transfer my bitcoin to another wallet with a different private key, then import the private key elsewhere to get the B2X.
But I don't know:
A) which wallets that support B2X will allow private key imports.
B) is my ledger private key the same for all my cryptocurrencies, so do I need to move all of them.
C) how easy it is to generate a new private key on ledger nano s.

What are everybody's thoughts on EtherParty - scam, or legit?

Well, that's obviously completely false or tailored statistics...
EDIT: Yep - just read the actual document. The article completely misunderstands and represents that data on an embarrassing level.
The number "58" occurs twice. I'll outline what it means both times:
In 2016 they did a survey of 58 people on why they hold Bitcoin.
Of the people who do have bitcoin, 58% of those hold it as an investment. Not 58% of the countries population. 58% of the % of the country who hold bitcoin. So if 5% of them held bitcoin it would be 2.9% of the population. (5 x 0.58).
Title should be: "More than 58% of Candadian Bitcoin holders do so as an investment, study suggests"
Misleading shit like this damaged crypto and it's reputation.
EDIT 2: u/wmx11 just seems to be promoting their own blog.
