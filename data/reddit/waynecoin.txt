Would love to know where they're getting the email addresses from. Am worried one of the exchanges has had a leak.

Or he could make an appeal to the community and let people vote up or down as they see fit.

It shows up as from getflowers.com according to their website.

Let's do it now. I'll sell you a bitcoin for $650.

The mere existence of them isn't what determines the price, it's their availability on the market. 
If there are 10 people in the world who want cards but only 2 are available the price will of course end up higher than if there are 10 people and 10 available cards.

Did not realize this was a thing. Thanks.

But WHY? It's not enough to say the price will go up next year because it went up this year. That will only happen in response to positive developments. Bitcoin has erupted into the public consciousness thanks to a lot of media attention and people learning about this shiny new technology, but you can only play that card once. What is next for bitcoin? If nobody can answer that question then there is great cause for skepticism.

Pretty sure "chinaman" is not the preferred nomenclature.

Bitcoins are still being used as a vehicle for trading value in this case. If my employer pays me in cash and I immediately go trade all that cash for bitcoin, is the cash "worthless"?

Dear god how is this so upvoted? A quick look at the bitcoiny 30 day chart is enough to show the price was $600 a month ago. As of this moment Bitcoin is down 10% from this time last month. 
No wonder people accuse this place of being a circlejerk.

I wondered about the exchange thing. It's definitely not an exact science here, but since wallets contain multiple addresses, and some people likely have multiple wallets, those 13,000 addresses account for far fewer actual individuals. Some of those are certainly exchanges, but for a decentralized currency a very small amount of it seems to be in very few hands.

Went through the same thing recently. I'm amazed at how people throw out the "just use your extra computer to install a new linux distribution making sure it never touches the internet, generate a random seed, etc etc" like its just the simplest process.
If you're not paranoid that your computer is already compromised, I would download electrum and write down the seed on a piece of paper when your wallet is generated. Transfer your coins to that wallet, then put the wallet file on a flash drive (or two for redundancy) and delete it from your computer. 
You now have your wallet file on a flash drive and the seed written on a piece of paper. Restoring wallets from seeds is pretty simple with electrum in case something happens to the wallet. I ran through this whole process a few times, with a tiny amount of bitcoin, deleting and restoring my wallet just to make sure everything worked before transferring any significant amount of BTC to the wallet.

The silk road event was pretty much the beginning of the big run up. The price was down for about a day before it began its steady climb to $1000.

Thanks for the reply. I wound up using app.gyft.com this weekend for this very reason, so I'm glad to hear about the possibility of a lite version.

This reminds me of nfl commentators who are always going on about "if player x gets 3 more completions today it will be the most successful consecutive game streak for a player over 6 feet tall who can do a back flip since 1973".

I did, and was patting myself on the back before remembering the bill was slightly more than my gyft card balance and I put the rest on my debit card. Dammit.
@_date: 2013-12-21 22:41:27
Is anybody aware of a way to mark cards as used on gyft? It can become difficult to keep track of what you have and haven't depleted after a while.

Bitcoin are mined in bundles. I think it started out as 50BTC per bundle (could be wrong on the specifics), so there is no single "first" Bitcoin.
Also those coins could be missing, or split apart in different addresses. Short answer is no, I don't think there's a collector's item coin out there.

There are other factors at play in the rise of costs across the sectors you mentioned. Attributing it all to fiscal policy is a bit tunnel visioned. There's no reason to suspect mass adoption of bitcoin would suddenly give more people access to health care, housing or higher education.

Oh geez I know this one... It's on the tip of my tongue

I'm guessing the faucet just isn't sending out coins for whatever reason. If you'd like you can mail me your bitcoin address and I can send you a penny to help test it out.
@_date: 2013-11-21 00:14:04
I'm amazed that some people are oblivious to the fact that Bitcoin is far less likely to catch on if you have to be the kind of person that has an extra computer lying around and a working knowledge of linux to use it.

Thinking about asking my boss to pay me in bitcoin. He's kinda lazy and hates change though.
I had been planning to sell a bunch when the price got to $400, but when it got there I just felt like it would be stupid to get rid of any at this point in time. Who cares about short term dips, it really seems like we'll be moving up in the medium term.
So I put all that in long term storage and just bought two coins on Coinbase that I'm planning on using for actual honest-to-god commerce. I'll buy some Amazon cards from [Gyft]( look for Bitcoin businesses in the area and pay a visit.

Just looking for something more specific. Are there any companies out there working on bitcoins problem areas? Can we expect improved security, simpler market entry and ease of use? There might be a lot going on behind the scenes but it would be great to know what to expect.
@_date: 2013-12-18 01:34:00
Nope, bought in pretty low and I'm still quite happy. I know plenty of people who did buy in over $1000 though and losing lots of money tends to sour one's opinion. I want Bitcoin to succeed and am holding onto everything past my initial investment, but I would like to be able to give people a reason to be optimistic.
