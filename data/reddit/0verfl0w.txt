Why does keep-key have only 12 recovery words while ledger have 20+ of them? Does it connected to security somehow?

The only thing I am woundering if KepKey will protect me on infected machine? is it safe to use it in public places ?

What do you think about ladger and keepkey? Which one to pick?

Yeah. Just did that. True to say, least loved sites are the most sleek and easy to use. Thats make me totally crazy.

I feel like im in love with keepkey after all. The only thing that stops me is that it haven't used that much. It could have exploits (like show wrong send to adr on display for infected machine) or just have a high % failure chips or just work bad and buggy. 
And I have a feeling that it is pricey so when It will update I will need to spend 200 bucks again.

It have locked bootloader, while keepkey is open source. 
I've just saw some mentions online, I don't have any proofs.


yes. for all the hardware wallets mentioned.


I didn't say that keepkey is cheap. But it is better made (materials, technology) and more reliable imo. That all in sum want me to spend this money on it. Actually now I am only waiting for reply from keepkey devs to resolve some compatibility questions.
