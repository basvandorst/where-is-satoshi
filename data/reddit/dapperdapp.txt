People still haven't learned about coinbase? I guess they never will.

Obviously we need to take Deploy and decentralize its payment structure over OpenBazaar, and create an app that makes it accessible through HTTP with a web interface, that we can then offer hosting for using Deploy 2.0
Its the only logical next step

That's amazingly bizarre.

Nah, I didn't downvote you. My point was that if you already get arrested, having your bank account closed down is a stone's throw away. I'm not disagreeing or anything.

You're lucky they didn't lock your account. Coinbase is probably the worst service in Bitcoin.

Honestly as other users said, Coinbase does this 10 times a day and people still come here to complain as if they are surprised. Not even Paypal locks accounts this often. I post a warning about Coinbase at least once a week.
Also please, don't _leave_ your money in a service or exchange. If it's not a bitcoin address that _you own_ then it's not a wallet, it's someone else holding your money and all you own is an IOU.
