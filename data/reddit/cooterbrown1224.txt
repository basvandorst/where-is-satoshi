Hey fellas. Got started in crypto about 6 months ago and have been doing small trades on coinbase. Never invest over $3000 and never hold longer than 2 or 3 weeks. I’d like to dabble in ripple, nano, and some other smaller coins. Any exchanges out there that are dependable and easy to use like coinbase that you might recommend?

I hope someone can give me some insight here. I understand the value and security behind blockchain technology but is there really any more use for cryptocurrency other than making profits? Never felt the need to send someone money in a way that it can’t be traced. I don’t really care if it’s traced. I’m cool with mailing a check or a domestic wire transfer from my bank for 7 bucks.
