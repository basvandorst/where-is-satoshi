Way to sell just to buy a USED car ��
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:19:03
I'm debating putting more money in but not experienced enough to know what futures will do... 
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:35:04
All kids. Jesus
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:57:00
Yes of course. I don't see it hitting 30 K but no one knows. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:41:45
I am still confused. Do your bitcoins need to be in an exchange at time of fork, such as Bittrex? Surely one does not get forked coins by having BTC in a hardware wallet, correct?
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:07:14
Will you buy more BTC ahead of the futures? 
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:54:15
Yes, thanks. I recently learned that. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:36:16
If you have been told since 2010 and haven't taken that step, not sure what to say except Oops 
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:56:34
Yes that's my point. They always have you sell appx $400 below actual BTC value and buy above actual market price. Unless I'm an idiot, which may be the case since I still use coinbase. Not anymore. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:13:31
People will sell after 1st if the new year. Look at btc chart Jan 2017 on CoinMarketCap. Huge dip. Ppl sell early in 2018 to avoid paying 2017 taxes. I'd wait until it dips first week in Jan. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:12:57
Good question my friend. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:36:24
Who is putting more money in today? 
@_date: 2018-05-24 05:32:51
Only the poor say that

That's true, forgot about that

Waiting for Remme to release their nodes, then I'll have one.. Finally.

Yes but Binance is already doing this with $BNB

@_date: 2017-11-11 19:40:33
3 confirmations in 3 hours for me. Coinbase to Bittrex. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:00:44
Because people want their money asap. And making it faster shows they are working to get this to the public asap, which means $$$
@_date: 2017-11-17 19:44:26
I xfered $1k of BTC from coinbase to my Trezor. It was instantaneous 
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:47:37
Great job. Go big or go home. What difference does it make.. 5500 or 6100? You're looking to make more than $400, right? Think long term. Would you pay $6k to get $20k right now but lose your right to ever invest in BTC again? Tough question but I'd decline it and ride the $6k!
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:30:28
Selling btc at 7k to put into bch, then sell bch to put back into btc is called insider trading lol
@_date: 2017-11-12 04:37:07
I feel a BTC surge coming. I feel it! 
@_date: 2017-11-11 17:32:39
I just sent Bitcoin to my wallet in Bittrex just to test how long this takes. If transactions keep taking a long time, people will eventually look to other options. Time is money and people want their money immediately. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 19:46:49

Will ethereum ever get off of 310? Seems like it's always hovering there

Next time, use a hardware wallet. You won't lose your coins that way.
Toodles 
@_date: 2017-11-10 17:21:15
Chill. All coins are in the red. Only temporary. Buy now! 
@_date: 2017-11-12 02:48:24
Then you're screwed. Same with paper. Lose that, you're screwed, but better take that risk then relying on a 3rd party/exchange to hold your money

@_date: 2017-11-12 02:08:27
Coinbase is good place to start. Use credit card to instantly buy BTC or bank account, which takes about 8 days to go through before you are credited.
BTC is a peer to peer money exchange with no 3rd party, such as bank or PayPal, involved. There are other players outside of BTC. BTC is the brand of Crypto. The Nike if you will. They are facing scalability problems and others trying to capitalize off that.
I just got into it myself. Fascinating.

@_date: 2017-11-11 15:29:45
Do I sell my $1000-ish worth of Bitcoin and buy POTcoin instead? ;) 
@_date: 2017-11-12 02:21:30
Research Hardware wallets. Ledger Nano S is popular and what I have. They are usb drives that store the money. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 18:59:30
Fee was 0.00093429 btc. Sent 10:57 am cst. Currently at 3 confirmations as of 1pm cst

You have me paranoid. I bought my Trezor from Amazon
@_date: 2017-11-12 00:37:12
I'm referring to the marketing side of it. Reaching those not yet in the know. A problem with technology is it sometimes intimidates. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:24:56
Although I was hoping it would drop more so I can buy more.. We'll see 
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:30:36
Lol yall crazy 
@_date: 2017-11-13 16:59:38
Overstock.com takes Bitcoin. Poker sites do too
Mainstream is here
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:38:59
She's looking for people to tell her to do it.
Do it! 
@_date: 2017-11-17 19:42:42
If that's the case, how can miners exist? No one would accept 600/year.. Well no one with the necessary supplies to do it. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 19:46:19
I bought at 7200 and felt terrible doing it. Oh well 
@_date: 2017-11-12 19:22:51
I expected a rebound greater than it is right now to be honest. Hopefully Monday pushes it up. BCH is done. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 00:26:16
Somewhat. Did most steps from my cell. Will try when in front of pc. I did Cisco routing so I get the concept but is this easy enough for consumers to understand? 
@_date: 2017-11-12 21:20:44
If Lightning is near, yes 
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:26:40
Real question is... Spend 10k if BTC gets to 3k..?
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:28:25
Buy now, I just did. It hit its low IMO

@_date: 2017-11-12 05:52:20
I paid at 6400 earlier.

Rip it off but then replace with a BTC one 
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:47:24
The fact they give so so many things to try gives me no confidence in their product 
@_date: 2017-11-11 02:00:39
We'll see but I see people overreacting. 7k by tonight 
@_date: 2017-11-10 22:17:54

If miners are needed, wouldn't that promote PoS?

You got too much time on your hands. Go back to mommy for chores. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 02:29:48
Step 1. Buy Bitcoin on Coinbase.
Step 2. Move Bitcoin to your wallet. You send to your wallet's public key from coinbase.
Step 3. If you want other coins, sign up on an exchange. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 18:48:20
No idea. I don't follow irrelevance 
@_date: 2017-11-14 15:01:17
Stories like these will always hold back crypto. If there's no trust, there's no business.
Sorry this happened. I'd be on a plane knocking on the door of block chain

Any interest in teaching what you know, for a fee? 
@_date: 2017-11-11 21:12:14
Thanks. I figured now is the time to buy more BTC.. So I did 
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:31:03
What's your brief reasoning that you believe this is just a dip? 
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:37:57
Similar affect to a pump and dump? 
@_date: 2017-11-12 20:48:18
Check your bank. Many don't accept such transactions online. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 19:15:41
Trust as in the company answering customer complaints or at least being available for problems. I'm not talking technical jargon. I'm talking about the business side of it, which apparently many of you tech-heads seem to forget. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 23:58:09
It's all about branding, and that's what Bitcoin has over everyone else. People who have only heard of one cryptocurrency, it's going to be Bitcoin!

Thanks. Will research now 
@_date: 2017-11-11 21:04:54
Will lightening be under BTC or forked to a new coin? 
@_date: 2017-11-12 00:15:22
Thanks.. I somewhat get this jist. Essentially you're playing consumer and retailer on both ends of the transaction. Is this similar to how lightning would work? 
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:14:37
I see ETH as the Google of crypto. Master of many trades 
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:52:33
5900 lol 
@_date: 2017-11-12 16:48:29
Exactly. BTC is long term investment. Part of me thinks I got in too late but hopefully those 'experts' are right with the $1m/BTC projection! 
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:13:37
I see Bitcoin going back to 7300/7400 before EOD. Enjoy the ride 
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:56:53
I'm trying to learn! Complicated

@_date: 2017-11-25 01:24:25

@_date: 2017-11-12 08:40:36
Wow I can't take it 
@_date: 2017-11-10 15:59:51
It's not dropping under 6k. BCH will drop 10% here shortly 
@_date: 2017-11-12 03:28:02
Oh you mean duplicates? Negative. Paper wallets, yes. Print as many copies as you want.

You pay for convenience. If you want to play, pay the extra couple bucks. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 02:04:06
It's the brand of cryptocurrency. They need to solve the speed issue, though. People say the Lightning upgrade is the key. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 23:03:55
Just because everything is still so new with no true history? Talking in general, what actions could make a coin dip outside of market manipulation? 
@_date: 2017-11-12 18:10:11
Much needed 
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:37:14
Coinbase is instantaneous if you use a credit card. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 22:18:00

You know what he's talking about. Stop trying to one-up the guy 
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:03:50
Dumped money will go back into BTC.. IMO. May be wrong. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 17:41:56
So it's essentially creating sub-blockchains to eliminate traffic? Interesting... But better hurry! 
@_date: 2017-11-25 19:58:55

@_date: 2017-11-14 16:43:41
Diversify. I'm doing 40 percent btc, 40 percent eth and 20 percent altcoins, though I'm really liking how dash is looking. May invest more there 
@_date: 2017-11-17 01:20:49

@_date: 2017-11-12 07:52:31
Right NOW
@_date: 2017-11-12 04:51:55
I think it's a pump. We'll see 
@_date: 2017-11-12 15:59:14
Dude you're talking like you're a big player... then you drop       .79 
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:31:12
God I wish I was as cool as you when I was 16. Fuck 
@_date: 2017-11-20 23:06:26
For Amazon to accept it

Wow! 
@_date: 2017-11-20 23:25:07
If they took bch in addition. Better if only bch.

Well look at that. BetUS takes Bitcoin! 
@_date: 2017-11-14 15:30:36
Of that's the case, some angry dude will go postal on block chain. Just not good business. Being a business owner myself, this really pisses me off 
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:22:18
I hear ya, but BTC is out there. How long has overstock taken btc? I just learned about that 
@_date: 2017-11-13 06:18:46
I bought at 7100, 6400, 6100 lol
@_date: 2017-11-11 03:03:26
Almost to 6800 
@_date: 2017-11-12 03:01:03
You can send any amount to any wallet. Just different transactions 
@_date: 2017-11-12 19:15:54
Coinbase. I'd rather pay a higher fee for reliability. Go with reputable vendors always 
@_date: 2017-11-12 04:32:59
It's all talk until your skin is in the game. Make a deposit and ride the roller coaster 
@_date: 2017-11-12 02:09:52
Set up account on an exchange if you want to trade in BTC for other coins. Poloniex and Bittrex are popular.
For 100k, get a hardware wallet to store your BTC. Never store that much anywhere online. Or do a paper wallet with laser ink printer. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 17:58:49
Understood completely. I come from online poker and many are frustrated with slow payouts. I think patience in general is dwindling, especially when it comes to getting your money 
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:18:41
Back to 6600. 7k then I'll go to bed 
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:48:13

Nevermind. I was doing the pin incorrectly on the Trezor ��������
@_date: 2017-11-17 04:44:39
I had to return mine as it kept freezing. Trezor much better. Good luck 
@_date: 2017-11-12 16:49:31
I'm looking closely at Dash 
@_date: 2017-11-15 15:25:26
Of course it's a good strategy if you know how to do it. You're here to make money right? 
@_date: 2017-11-11 17:56:31
I'll post when I get home in a bit. I sent about 900 bucks

I'm debating. I bought at 7200, 7100 6400 and 6200. Kicking myself for not buying when it last dipped 
@_date: 2017-11-16 18:52:54
Understood. Just looking for opinions
