If you use ETH don't send it from exchange to exchange directly. A lot of exchanges use smart contracts for automating withdrawals where transactions are made as "internal transactions". A lot of exchanges cannot recognize these kind of transactions (due to their shitty software).
So always have a wallet in-between. Send eth first to your wallet (MyEtherWallet, Ledger nano, etc.) and then to another exchange.

What books did you buy? :) I see some packaging, probably from the bookdepository.

Or maybe invest $10 in the Blockchain Index fund instead. This fund invests in all the major crypto - it's a crypto index fund:

Segwit has been activated in August 2017. So segwit2x isn't really about segwit. It's about changing the blocksize from 1MB to 2MB. Core developers oppose raising blocksize because it would decrease decentralization. So in November Bitcoin will split into 1MB and 2MB Bitcoin.

I think they made all the solutions compatible. Non-segwit transactions are still accepted.

B2X is not increasing block size to 2MB? Please explain.
@_date: 2017-10-11 22:13:15
Okay, first of all let me address the political talk you are always including at the end of your comments. I agree we should emphasize more that the core implementation itself brings increase in data transmitted (from 1 MB to 4 MB). Often people don't understand why we wouldn't "increase the blocksize from 1 MB to 2 MB" since it's "only 1 MB" increase. But in reality this means going from 4MB data to 8MB data transmitted between nodes. Which is a big difference. So I agree we definitely shouldn't support B2X.
But what I'm discussing with you is the technical view on block size(s). It might be trivial, but as you acknowledged - due to backwards compatibility, the 1 MB data (transaction block without witnesses) is the most important data and is the "1st class citizen" of the blockchain. The other data can be pruned and you still have a valid chain.
Edit: I just noticed you linked my first comment and framed me as a big blocker which is totally false. I usually avoid name calling over the internet, but you must be a total nut. Get a life and learn how to converse with some manners.

If Szabo was Satoshi, he would've used his real name. He was never afraid of using a real name. Same goes for Finney.
Also when Satoshi published the whitepaper, Szabo was actively discussing his BitGold project on his blog with his readers. I highly doubt he'd do this if he was Satoshi.
While Szabo and Finney are/were definitely very brilliant men (geniuses I dare say), they are most likely not Satoshi in my opinion. Satoshi didn't want to be in the center of attention and just wanted to push his great idea to the world as quickly as he could. A humble genius who cherished his own privacy.

The block size will remain 1 MB. The increase you are talking about is due to extension blocks where the witness data will be stored. The only true (necessary) blocks in the chain are transaction blocks. Extension blocks can be pruned.

Yes, he's a pretty well-known (at least in the startup world) Silicon Valley venture capitalist (VC).

Don't ever do this (even if you know how to trade) because this is what caused the Great Depression. People taking a loan in order to buy stocks. They inflated a bubble and when the market went down a bit they started to panic sell. 
Crypto has to grow reasonably, with part of the money that people saved, not borrowed!

Let's see what non-mining nodes will be signalling. This is a bit more important than miners.
