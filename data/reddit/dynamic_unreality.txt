So if the movie studios offer their movies with a massive amount of seeding bandwidth, could they not start taking a profit on file sharing, rather than trying to squash it? If you are paying to download the content anyway, why not pay that to the actual content creators by using their seeds?

Why would people lie about anything? Usually to get attention, or to attempt to uphold some ideal or principle that they believe is more important than the truth. You are making extremely serious accusations, and want people to listen to you, but you don't have a screenshot, or chatlogs, or any single sort of shred of evidence to show that btc-e did anything wrong. I still trust them more than I trust you. You claimed "Mr [sic] friend claims to lost 100000 dollar on here, and me about 2000 euros." $100k is a fuck ton of money to accuse someone of stealing and just be like nah, believe me, they did it! And then it goes from your friend to something you had read about. You aren't helping anyone by claiming they stole from you with no evidence, and making up/retelling secondhand stories. 
Rather than ask why would you lie, I'd like to know why we should believe you.

Not really. I personally think the ill-will you guys are going to get over this will counteract any fees you receive. You keeps saying how it's not a lot of money, and that it can be used for tx fees (maybe? not sure I get it. [edit:nope, it seems all fees go to you, donations can be used towards WALLET fees? That's not a donation]) or whatever, but that doesn't help. You are charging people a non-optional fee to use their own bitcoin. You don't see how this is antithetical to bitcoin users?
@_date: 2014-06-13 17:59:42
Yep. Although I am not suggesting people "invest" in cex.io without running numbers and buying on dips. It's certainly not guaranteed money, especially if the network difficulty starts jumping 20% every change again.
I am just saying, I have made money at cex.io, to dispute what others have said about not being able to.
@_date: 2014-09-14 18:15:34
Coinbase is doing what it needs to do to protect itself. It is following the rules more tightly than YOU believe is necessary, but governments LOVE to retroactively make laws more conservative, and coinbase is just covering its own ass.
MANY more people use coinbase easily and successfully than have problems, but people only post their complaints. We don't hear from the thousands of satisfied customers, so it is easy for your opinion to become biased toward the negative.
Coinbase is the best and easiest way to buy bitcoin in the US. Circle also seems decent, but they aren't available to everyone yet. Once coinbase has some competition, maybe they will change their policies a little bit, but right now they are doing things they way they think is right, and it is working well for many of us.
Also, learn some grammar and learn to proofread if you want to be taken seriously, dashes are not periods.

Nothing if I get it from my credit union or a bank, something like $0.65 or so if I walk into nearly any gas station, grocery store, or pharmacy. Versus $10 per checkbook last I got them. Which, yes, per check is cheaper, but if I would only write one every year it would still be more expensive. Just saying. I'm not like against checks, I just never need them.

@_date: 2014-07-17 17:24:16
That is exactly why I said the correction wasn't a "plunge". I have been watching the price for months. I actually made 20% buying on the dips. I am out of that dangerous game, but right now, there are THOUSANDS of greater fools waiting to get in on the mining train. People still buy BFL!
@_date: 2014-08-22 18:53:39
But you don't get back what you invested, at least not after any considerable amount of time. The price per gh/s is constantly falling due to the difficulty rising.
That said, PETAMINE is cheaper per gh/s, and ASICminer, while not currently paying divs, has a history of major profitability in the past, especially considering they are aiming for 20% of the network and resuming dividends soon, the per share price seems reasonable to me.
THAT being said, the hashrate is shooting up again, so you can't be sure of calculations, as it looks like another 20%+ jump in difficulty again in ~10 days.
@_date: 2014-09-14 18:06:15
Why? Because they protect themselves from fraud like a successful company does?
Your comment actually makes zero sense, my reply is to what I believe you meant to say. lol.

It has been for me. Show me some numbers? I am up by better than 25% in the last month, why does everyone keep telling me this isn't profitable? Is profit something other than having more value than you started with, or am I the one confused?
Is it a place to hold your btc long term? No. Is it still profitable? Very much so for me.

@_date: 2014-08-29 22:40:02
I believe there is room to disagree. The node size limit of asics will begin to slow the rate of increase that the hashrate is experiencing now, and mining hardware, while still near parity with electrical rates, could still be affordable to run continuously for well more than six months. IF/when the hashrate ever decides to stabilize a bit.
Although alternatively, if the price per gh/s or gh/j continues to drop dramatically even after the node size limit is reached, through increased efficiency in either hardware or software, then my assumptions are moot.
@_date: 2014-09-18 05:17:23
Your definition of trolling is quite lacking, and shows a basic misunderstanding of the term. What you describe is a type of trolling, yes, but not what trolling is in its entirety. Trolling is the act of engaging someone with the intent to piss them off, or cause them to rage, or create drama of some sort, leading to anger, which can then be chuckled about. Hence the classic "U mad bro?"
And this is EXACTLY what buttcoin is doing, so yes, you are all trolling. A sub full of people who like to laugh at their own jokes about the dumb people involved in a culture that is not their own, sounds like my kind of community.

I am not invested in CEX.IO, although I made better than 20% profit for the short period when I was. I have just been watching the price. What I believe it will do, and what I believe it SHOULD do are two different things. I believe it will bounce back up, maybe not to the peak, but back. Why? Because the difficulty is not jumping as quickly as before, and people will jump back on the train.

Coinbase is the only real, easy way for me to get coins. I don't want to go meet some stranger to get my coins, when I can sit on my ass and have them delivered via recurring buy weekly. 
There is no good alternative yet in the US to buy coins. Coinbase isn't scamming anyone. If your order is cancelled, your money is refunded. Scams are intentional deceit designed to part fools from their money with nothing or very little in return.
I get my coinbase purchases instantly. I don't even have to put clothes on and meet some stranger. I love coinbase, and they are doing great things for bitcoin in the US.

So having ONE problem with them because of their fraud abuse policy means we should never use them? There sure are a lot of extremists in here.
I use coinbase with ZERO problems. Why should OP need to hide his IP from them anyway? They already know who he is, just use a regular browser for coinbase and if he wants to use TOR all day and browse slowly as fuck for no reason the rest of the day, he can go ahead. But you're bitching because a service protects itself from fraud.

Except that when all the alts are traded in bitcoin, as its market cap goes down, so does the market cap of the alts, even without anyone selling off any alts. The alt/btc ratio is more important in this regard than marketcap, because even if no one sells a single dogecoin to exchange for bitcoin to exchange for fiat, the market cap of doge goes down with bitcoin if the ratio stays equal. I was looking and it seems that only a few have fallen much more percentage-wise than bitcoin, and that is no more than normal.

What you don't understand is that if this is a serious problem, the solution is not to ask people, who are inherently self-interested, to extract less value from already nearing razor thin profits, if most of them are even making a profit. If this is a problem with the bitcoin protocol, then the bitcoin protocol needs to solve the problem. If it is a problem with the community, then someone in the community needs to step up and create an alternative.
When people moved away from btcguild it was because there were acceptable alternatives available. Care to share a few good alternatives or create your own rather than just call people names?

I feel that there is an active anti-coinbase propaganda program going on here lately. Especially seeing how the hate seems to spike at times. I have zero proof, but the level of hate and spite feels crazy to me, like way over the top for the minor problems people have with them.

So if you buy on coinbase then move them directly to your personally controlled wallet, where is the problem?
Coinbase is a connection to the legacy banking system, and is BY FAR the easiest way (at least for me) to acquire bitcoin. They MUST proactively regulate themselves or risk being shut down.
How is coinbase anything like paypal? you don't even explain yourself, you are just acting like a child, apparently because coinbase isn't a perfect anarchist's tool.

@_date: 2014-11-22 19:55:23
"Best", and "perfect" are generally subjective words. You cannot always make the "best" choice, but if a choice is 99.999% correct, why fuck everything up for that last .001% to make it "perfect"? This is how decisions are made in real life, there is rarely a perfect option. Satoshi could STILL be debating this right now, trying to figure out what perfection even means, and we would have no bitcoin.
People make the best choices they can with the information available to them, though rarely are those choices "perfect".

If you were buying gh/s without being able to sell them, you might be right, but I have been making steady profits through cex.io, so if they are overpriced, I'd love to see how much I'd make if they weren't.

Who else has 0% fees and pays out all merged mined coins? I'll move if you can give me a pool with those features and as much uptime as ghash.io. 
I don't fear a double spend attack, seeing as cex.io would cripple itself and its entire profitability in the process. They are making money every day, do you know how big the payout would have to be to throw that all away? And considering that the double spend would be immediately noticed, whatever they earned through it would be next to worthless as the price would crash before they could sell their haul. This is temporary, we were talking the same shit about btcguild before, and the bitcoin mining community evolved away from the threat, and it will again.
When someone decides to do something about cex.io by creating a worthy competitor, rather than just bitching and calling names on reddit, maybe the community will actually listen.
Or hell, give me a good, easy to use way to p2pool with merged mining and I'd much rather do that.

Since I have been looking into it, I already did, actually. I just find people bitching to be repugnant, and not helpful, otherwise I'd have switched before and said nothing. People want to complain about self-interested people not doing something selfless, when honestly, that is the wrong way to think about it. Bitcoin mining is a selfish action, we are not doing it for altruism. (A very small percentage of miners perhaps do, but CERTAINLY not a majority.) If the way the bitcoin protocol works creates this problem, which it has, then we need to come up with a better solution than trying to complain on reddit and expecting people to be egalitarian.

@_date: 2014-09-19 23:38:49
No, that is actually not what I am saying at all. Fiat money, ESPECIALLY as it is created today, with the exception of a few coins, is nearly free to create, making banking seigniorage extremely profitable, hence, leading banks to put the profits of said seigniorage into the stock market, driving up the price. I am no expert, obviously, but I do believe you actually said the opposite of what I meant. Am I saying that this is a bad situation? Yes, but not due to inefficiency of seigniorage, perhaps saying it is an inadequate method of creating value.
Correct me if I'm wrong? I am winging it here, and know very little on the subject of seigniorage.

"Since you can never make a profit off such high mining prices" is just patently false. I have made better than 25% profit in less than a month. Don't forget you can resell your gh/s after you mine with them, once you put that into the calculations, as long as you don't buy during a rally, there is profit to be taken.

With the asic chip size limitations coming into view and no end in sight to the ever expanding addition of mining equipment to the network, does thorium have a chance to take over as an alternative energy source for big mining farms? Could the production and generation of cheap alternative energy be a byproduct of bitcoin? 
I say yes. Nearly as abundant as lead, and cheap because no one needs it yet? It's evolution. We don't even know how to mine it properly yet, according to the article. It would be amazing if someone related to bitcoin figured out how, and paid for it in bitcoin they mined. Bitcoin mining squared.

Well then dismissing everyone who uses or likes the idea of bitcoin does no credit to you as a person. 
There are stupid people in every subreddit and every facet of life and culture. The ones into bitcoin are no different. Why follow them around and fuck with them?

It really isn't hard to be wittier than the lowest common denominator, and it is quite showing about your personality that you feel the need to swagger the way you do.

It is the resell value of the gh/s that gives them the "high" price. I have been making a steady profit from cex.io for a while now, especially with difficulty being semi-unpredictable at the moment, plenty of troughs to buy in at. 
And this coming from someone who has learned bitcoin mining and investing "the hard way", by taking losses before I found gains.  
But I am in the black with cex.io already, so unless they suffer a catastrophic failure, it doesn't seem to have been very stupid for me to have put my money there.

If a serious double spend attack is what it takes to stop finding temporary solutions to this problem, then it is going to happen, and then a real solution will be found, or bitcion will deserve to die.

Why do you assume that he should even give you the time of day to answer your vitriolic accusations and questions? He has been very nice, polite, and helpful nearly every time I have seen him post, actually.

So... I fail to see why Circle wins? You instantly bought very nearly the same amount of coin instantly on both sites, I don't see how their is a major difference to declare a "winner"? Is it like the nickel less bitcoin you got with coinbase? I am quite confused.
If it is the difference in coin recieved, don't forget, apparently many cards will show circle as a cash advance, charging an extra 2-3%, so some people will not see a price savings with circle as you did.
They are both super easy for me to use.

This isn't about shills, this is about you only seeing black and white, and you are being downvoted because people like me disagree with you.
That being said, I am an open supporter of Coinbase, and have used their service for a year with no trouble or complaints. And I feel that I am in a silent majority. Most people have no problems with Coinbase, but then there is no story for reddit from those people, you only hear the complaints. Over and over, the same crap complaints... 
Stop trying to make huge buys bigger than your normal buys when the price tanks or starts shooting up, as that is not what Coinbase is for, and you will most likely stop having these problems. Use a real exchange with a predefined ask and bid if you want a guaranteed price and sale. Is that more difficult? Yes, certainly, but that is exactly the price you pay to use Coinbase.

Coinbase is a bitcoin buying and selling service, not an exchange. When the price is volatile, their risk goes up, and therefore more people are flagged and orders cancelled. They used to have days when they RAN OUT of bitcoin to sell. Everything seems to be in order to me, I have never had an order cancelled, in over a year.

This is about way more than just making money on the value of bitcoin as a currency. The apps being built on top of bitcoin are just starting to emerge, and the idea that bitcoin enables a decentralized trust network is just beginning to catch hold with people who can make a difference.

I'm pretty sure 80% of the bitcoin community actually has no idea whether increasing the block size is good or not, they just either go along with Gavin, or assume bigger = better. So to pretend like a poll of users actually contains useful information is farcical.

Not sure that it was enough to get the move we did, but the fundamentals for litecoin have actually starting looking better recently. What with the bitcoin forks and stress tests, people have been looking at how litecoin is different. 
I see faster block times and hence faster confirmations, and although these are undeniably less secure at this moment in time than bitcoin, litecoin difficulty is going up steadily. 
And according to it already has measures built in to resist the type of stress tests/attacks bitcoin has been undergoing, which the bitcoin devs rejected. 
So there has been a bit to go on, but there is no doubt a pump and dump was playing on people's emotions. Probably a lot of *THIS IS IT*s happenings got some people fucked.

First of all, there is not a single, non-biological thing that **everyone** else does. Second, I don't give a fuck about your ridiculous cultural norms, obviously. Does that make me somehow inferior to you? And if so, how? Doesn't it seem wrong to be judging me based on a culture that I don't subscribe to? Everything is a fucking insult. Go cry about it. But it doesn't change the meaning of the word ignorant, nor does it change the fact that I actually enjoy arguing semantics, because they actually matter when attempting to communicate ideas properly. 
Funniest part about this?


You spent all that time typing out what ended up being nothing **but** ad hominem attacks against me, whilst not even bringing up the point, nor actually rebutting what I said. That's twice you haven't been able to make your point, and you are still wrong. Thing is, I don't even care. lol.

Hmm, that's not what I said, maybe you meant to reply to someone else? I didn't say your post was pointless, I said your priorities are fucked up. Although, while we are on the subject, look at the wall of text you wrote, over something so trivial. It took me less than 3 minutes to reply, I think I can afford the time.

You shouldn't be using coinbase as a wallet anyway. You should buy from coinbase, and send to a personal wallet. Then you don't need to worry about that refund counting against you at coinbase at all.

The video in question is still available from TED, on their website, alongside a debate about the merits of the talk. This is the furthest thing from censorship, allowing the ideas to be debated, rather than attempting to say they don't exist.

JRE: Eddie Huang TED Conference Exposed: 
@_date: 2015-03-09 18:42:43
I'm not saying TED is awesome in every way, and in fact I linked to that same video elsewhere in this discussion, showing how cultish TED is becoming.
How is this discussion censorship? Both videos are shown directly on the page you linked, along with the discussions regarding why they were removed from the main youtube channel. Soooo where is the censorship? 
@_date: 2015-03-09 19:57:35
Neither talk has ever been hard to find. They had already been reposted by the time TED removed them from their main youtube channel, I watched Graham Hancocks presentation after it had supposedly been censored. Censoring something means making unavailable to the public. They are doing exactly the opposite of this by making it available, even if they believe the talks to not be up to a standard they have. The blog post explained why they removed them, and allowed for a discussion as to why they were removed. 
After the fact or not, both videos are there to be found, and seriously who gives a fuck? Anyone who is "censored" by TED pitches a fit, and their talk is posted somewhere anyway. I have yet to find someone complaining that a TED speaker has been completely silenced, or any actual "lost" talks.
@_date: 2015-03-08 23:26:02
They haven't censored anything that I know of. The talk you are most likely referring to was simply not posted online because it sucked, and the guy who made the talk bitched and got a paid PR campaign going to say he was censored.

You aren't taking into account AM's gen two chips and new products also coming to market. There was an announcement today that blades are sold out and new blades at a better price coming at the end of June or early July. Better prices means sales will boom, keeping divs up for the foreseeable future. I expect Friedcat and Co will keep this operation running strong for quite a bit longer than August. He's got first mover advantage. You think Avalon can pump out that many chips that quickly, yet AM can't continue to deliver? People seem to value Asicminer as though everyone else is moving and they are sitting still, and this is certainly not the case. I guess that's why people keep getting surprised by Asicminer.

Damn dude, you are about a douchebag.  Your family might not be technically savvy enough to appreciate a heartfelt gift like this, but many people are. Actually there are several people in my family (who know little or nothing about bitcoin) who would have been VERY interested in getting a paper wallet. In fact, I mentioned it in passing when someone said something about a bank screwing them over, and I had a crowd around me asking questions and wanting to learn more. My cousin even said "So do you have some bitcoin for me? I have a wallet!" And I kinda wish I had a paper wallet to give him. Are there some people in my family that would roll their eyes and just throw it away? Yes. But there are some who would certainly have appreciated the thought and concern put into it, especially if the price rises 10x or more again, they know I am thinking of their future as well. But either way, I thought it was the thought that counts? I guess not for you. Ass. If someone gets you a gift you don't like or understand, you smile and say thank you and appreciate that they even thought of you, they could have gotten you NOTHING. Or, that is what gracious people seem to do, I guess your family must be different.
TLDR just because your family is full of easily annoyed uneducated people doesn't mean everyone's is, and I think paper wallets make a great gift.

LOL good call. I am not saying I agree with anything he says, and a million is a hugely optimistic number, I know, but this is still a big deal for some people. Considering the number and being on mainstream, it puts visions in the heads of the types of people who watch Fox all day. Those visions can be good for bitcoin popularity, IMO. Or create more bubbles. I don't know, just sharing : )

"Unless the only way you're getting Bitcoins is through freebee sites, you're going to have to interact with some service or some person to obtain them, and the reality is, they can screw you over."
Isn't that true about gold (or nearly ANYTHING in the world?!?), too? You buy gold through third parties over the net or face to face, unless you are a miner yourself or go around finding jewelry on the ground. (The equivalent of BTC faucets). In those situations, the other person might screw you over by selling you fake gold, or SAYING they are storing your physical gold when they are actually fractionally reserving it. So how is bitcoin any different? Storing your wealth through third parties is always a risk (sometimes a lesser risk than storing it yourself, sometimes not), whether it is gold, silver, fiat, or bitcoin. Take a look at MF Global if you want an example of a HUGE non-bitcoin loss due to a third-parties negligence.

I have found most of this subreddit to be more helpful and less rude than most subreddits. I see questions asked and answered, I see difficult to explain topics handled well, I see new people satisfied. People on reddit are dicks. If you watch your post like a hawk, yeah, those people comment and downvote first, because they are losers who get their sense of power from reddit. But if you wait a few hours, normally the regular subs come in and comment decently and respectfully. So where is your original post for proof of your accusations? I find a lot of people who complain about this actually were in the wrong, either rude or short, or didn't even try to search for the answer to a question that is asked daily. If you don't want people to be rude to you, get off the internet.

Unless you bought direct shares from an owner on the forums, and quietly, then yes, it probably would move the price a bit on either BTCT or Bitfunder.

I disagree. Asicminer has second gen chips in the works and plans on keeping a comparatively high percentage of the total network hashrate, most likely for a very competitive price per mh/s. Also, hardware sales have been increasing the dividend every week since they started selling hardware, and is the only company that is available to ship a product in a reasonable amount of time. They were the first ASIC company to come to market, and I think they will use this huge advantage to stay ahead for a good deal of time to come.

I am finding it strange how many people are talking about what the old guy who knows nothing about it thinks, but the fact that BILL "FUCKING" GATES CALLED IT A TECHNO TOUR DE FORCE! is nearly ignored in the comments. This is a HUGE endorsement. My grandparents or parents might care what Charlie Munger thinks, but Bill Gates has a better reputation with the people who would be more likely to understand and use bitcoin. This is a plus one in my book. Someone needs to ask him more about it.

So would you say the same thing to a grandmother giving her grandchildren savings bonds? It is almost EXACTLY the same thing, but one is totally acceptable and an everyday practice, and the other makes someone comparable to someone handing out bibles? Either gift, a savings bond, or a paper wallet, is based on the giver's perception of the future, based on careful (or not so careful) observation of previous results, NOT based on some kind of pure faith, so the bible comparison is way off, just starting there. A person giving a paper wallet is thinking about the receiver's future well being and has their best interests at heart. Gifts ARE NOT required to be based on what the recipient wants or desires, especially seeing as sometimes people have no idea they wanted something until it is gifted. Sorry, but this argument makes you sound pretty spoiled in my opinion, and apparently in others, hence the downvotes.
Also, who else's perception of the future should he use? Or COULD he? Maybe you are psychic and know what everyone thinks about the future, but that is a luxury I do not share.
Also also, who cares what they think of it now, if grows into $10k they will certainly appreciate it, and if it goes to $0, well was the Monopoly board or whatever they would have been gifted sitting dusty on the shelves in 6 months REALLY that much better?

Totally not my point. My point was that you were being smug and presumptuous, and then trying to say that you didn't want to sound like a dick.

Yeah, sorry if I don't believe you, considering the reason they were suspicious is that they all read like they are written by the same person or off a script.
