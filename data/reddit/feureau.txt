I'm looking for a good alternative to blockchain. Can you expand on how good strongcoin is?
@_date: 2013-11-19 09:11:27


Dayum. Why didn't you sell? 
@_date: 2013-11-10 15:19:14
I lost it then many years later I opened the blockchain account. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 09:12:36
Dayum. The bot also tips in beercurrency now...
@_date: 2013-11-09 17:45:33
I lost my passphrase AND the .dat file :/
@_date: 2013-11-16 23:20:19
Mine too.
A redditor up there recommended strongcoin. Does anyone know if it's good enough?
@_date: 2013-11-16 23:27:00
Thanks. Though after reading blockchain's responses down there, I've decided that they couldn't be trusted with my three fiddy.
You should move away from them too.
@_date: 2013-11-09 22:43:18
Wait, what?
@_date: 2013-11-19 00:31:40
Do you think it will crash again this time?
@_date: 2013-07-30 16:42:40
bitpay would make a shit ton of money by doing this.
@_date: 2013-11-16 23:24:44
As a blockchain user, here's mine: 
Moved my coins away from blockchain. Everyone should follow suit.
@_date: 2013-11-16 23:14:13
I guess it's about time for a replacement to blockchain to surface...
EDIT: Since this is the top thread: If any redditor is following this thread, you should scroll down. A LOT. Blockchain is shooting themselves in the head and redditors are downvoting a LOT so the conversation is buried down there.
@_date: 2013-11-19 00:32:21
how much did you buy?
@_date: 2013-11-19 09:15:34
I wonder what causes these crash?
some bots were triggered?
@_date: 2013-11-09 23:17:47
t... they did?
@_date: 2013-11-19 08:33:00
Fine. I'll steal your bitcoin some other time.
@_date: 2013-11-19 09:17:47
MtGox is still at 714. Which exchange is at 500?
@_date: 2013-11-09 19:29:11
*shakes fist*
@_date: 2013-11-09 18:00:21
Can I do this with blockchain too?
@_date: 2013-11-16 23:21:59
I have tremendous respect towards people like you. People with integrity. May our paths cross again in much better terms. Blockchain sucks. I'm moving.
@_date: 2013-11-19 09:13:55
I lost my coins when I deliberately formatted my HD. 
    &gt;.&gt;
Stupid shortsighted past me. Bitcoin is just a fad, they said. You're just doing this mining for fun, they say.
@_date: 2013-11-19 08:34:06
^ found the guy who bought bitcoin at $900 and wondering if he should sell at current $700+ or wait for the crash to $200+
@_date: 2013-11-19 09:16:00
I wonder if I can sell in CNY and convert to USD and re-buy in bitcoins...?
@_date: 2013-11-16 23:12:28


How do I do this?
@_date: 2013-11-17 00:05:06


Found anything juicy?
@_date: 2013-11-09 18:20:47
@_date: 2013-11-16 23:14:40
Anyone got a good alternative to blockchain? They're about to lose another user.
@_date: 2013-11-19 00:29:05
So do we know who satoshi is yet?
