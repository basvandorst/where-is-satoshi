I love Coinbase for consumer use, but is Coinbase ever going to take an API-like role that would allow them to be used for trading bots / ATM's / etc?

As an operator of a US Based ATM, I'm happy to see the spread, and the volume is increasing month by month, but not where we'd hoped.. At least not yet.. :)

Thanks for the mention.
As others in the thread have said, we've installed a Robocoin unit. We did the research and it seemed like the most complete, mature 2-way product available. We felt it was very important to provide both buying and selling, in a public location, easy to find, and open a wide range of hours/days.
As FirebirdR said, there are both State and Federal requirements to providing any sort of Currency Exchange, which any Bitcoin ATM or Exchange does. We are in full compliance with all applicable policies, of which the ID requirements are included, but only for initial registration.
We hope the ATM is both a service for the existing BTC community in the Portland/Vancouver area, and a way to introduce more people to Bitcoin. Now when someone asks you "How do I buy bitcoin?" You don't have to spend 30 minute explaining the Exchange registration process.. You can tell them "Go to the Van Mall and use the machine!"
If anyone has questions about the machine, access, etc, feel free to use the contact form on our web site. We'd love to hear from you!

FYI Amazon gift cards can be canceled/removed up to 45 days after redemption. Happened to me, twice. :(

Find a bitcoin ATM - much faster than an exchange, reasonable fees, and help support the Bitcoin community!

Thanks for the question, I changed the verbage to make it more clear.
The "spot" rate quoted at the time of purchase is the complete price, and includes the ATM fee.
On the backend we're either buying coins off the open market to replenish what we sold you, or selling the coins you just deposited to equal the cash we just gave you, in what FINCEN calls a "3 party transaction", hence the need for MT/MSB certification.
So if the market was flat (IE buy/sell close together), and the price was $100 on the exchange, the machine would sell for $105, or buy for $95. More often, however, we see some spread between buys/sells on the exchanges, so it would be a bit more/less on each side.

Initial registration requires govt issued ID and cell phone with SMS abilities. Once registration has been completed, you log in with your cell then enter the 2FA code sent via SMS.
