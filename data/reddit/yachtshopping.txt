Man you are racist. Just stop now. I can’t believe you just said that about black people. &lt;—- that’s how dumb you sound right now, splicing hairs and after losing the ideas debate are now trying to engage in an epistemological debate with me about how far can “hyperbole” be extended.

Imagine? Look at them now even with the much needed government intervention - it’s awful. But, yeah take those rules away ... because those billionaires will just have a soul and not exploit their workers anymore. Pie in the Sky naive fantasies.

Most people that get to that level of wealth have psychopathic tendencies. It takes a particular personality trait to get to where they are in life and keep and maintain their status. [Telegraph ]( [Business Insider]( [Forbes]( so if you are waiting for ridding the world of psychopaths - you must realize they are one of the same.
How else can someone with billions in the bank, lobby politicians to advocate for more tax relief while staring at a society that is broken and poor. How many Americans live in abject poverty? 45 million at last count.

Hyperbole isn’t false claims, it’s a literary device. For those people that don’t understand a literary device are probably sheep and probably the same ones that are fooled by economic policies such as trickle down/supply side economics.

The “libertarian” ... lol. Yes, because corruption definitely won’t exist when “libertarians” take over.

It’s hyperbole to highlight the point. Most people don’t even know there’s a link at all. Most will assume the thought “some are good people, on both sides...”
