It is used primarily for online black market purchases, it is unregulated and open to manipulation, it is highly volatile, the block chain can help track where funds go but also can help erase any money trail and be completely anonymous.

What a joke..

This is actually good news.

Then there are even claims that the CIA and other government agencies are the the ones financing and running the drug markets, only to turn around and seize the drugs, claim they are winning the war on drugs, and repeat the cycle.

I feel like the hackers are only going to create more advanced and untraceable ways of stealing bitcoins from weak wallets. Until there's an easy way to secure your funds, most people would rather keep their money in a bank.

I agree, my nexus 5 has been able to handle everything I throw at it with no lag whatsoever. Android and bitcoin go hand in hand. Apple will learn from their mistakes.

Are those antminers? What kind of setup and hashrates do you get?

I'm starting to realize that Bitcoin is just the prototype digital currency. The real value is the blockchain. Blockchain technology can function without bitcoin. I don't hold much btc these days. Until it's regulated or backed by a government, it's just the modern wild west of people stealing and scamming each other.

Send it to the Chinese exchange okcoin futures and leverage it 20x. You can very easily make or lose money this way. If you just want to gamble it away, moneypot.com is pretty crazy. You could also offer to buy other students bitcoins for 50$ cash right on the spot, and sell those btc on a exchange for a quick profit, I suggest doing as many things as you can, for science.

I think people would be willing to help you out if you provided some proof of your claims. Otherwise this is just seen as another scam.

Wasn't this researched and found to be 90% gambling websites and exchanges, not actual new users or adoption.

He said they had an ETF with bitcoin exposure that's made them 5x returns. What's he talking about?

I can tell you why.. Because btc price movements are mostly artificial. There really isn't that many people using bitcoin, much less trading it. Market manipulation is rampant. Insiders will move the price to make it seem like it it follows market sentiment, but its all a show to take other trader's money/btc. I wouldn't be surprised if the two developers that are hostile forking Bitcoin Core went and sold/shorted bitcoin before they announced the fork. It is a sad day in bitcoin land when developers betray the community and devalue the currency by forcing a hard fork rather than discussing ideas openly and coming to consensus.

If they keep the donation in btc it could gain/lose a massive amount of value.   Hopefully somebody is managing the funds appropriately.

I remember reading purse.io bought gift cards using stolen credit cards and that's how they provided the discounts. Customers had to deal with the fraud and lost money. Youth are innocent and while bitcoin is not a scam, the bitcoin space is full of scams and fraudsters preying on innocent folk.

Thank you for contributing to the community.

Btc was the first, but I feel like some other developers/banks will create a similar form of currency/digital tokens that is totally centralized and closed source, but its insured, regulated, and widely accepted.

US Marshall pumping the price for their auction in a few weeks. They have to dump 50,000 coins before price dips below 160, its a hard feat to pull off.

This would be my indicator to short from 255 back down to 200
