Put it into your Euro wallet and do a SEPA transfer to your bank account.
Or move it over to a localbitcoins wallet and sell on there as a national bank transfer.

No. Our relationship with the EU has made everything so polarised. Brexit is one side of the argument, Remain is the other polar opposite.
Your (obviously biased) comment that Brexit is responsible for the polarisation is the equivalent of saying that gays are responsible for polarising the debate over gay marriage.

Sorry to hear about your troubles, Coinbase are an absolute shambles for support and I simply don't trust their service any more.
The crypto space is absolutely crying out for a reliable service for getting funds in and out of fiat. Anyone that came up with a working solution would mop up. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:12:59
You could use localbitcoins but the price is usually higher than on coinbase so it's 6 of one and half a dozen of the other. I still just eat the 4% fee with a nationwide debit card and accept that the rate is just the price you pay for instant btc. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 22:34:13

But if the idea of bitcoin is to create an alternative decentralised currency, then an ever increasing value isn't going to stabilise it so that it can be used as such? Seems to me that bitcoin can only ever be used as a store of value.

Im liking the cut of Revolut's jib but have never dived in with it. If you register your revolut account on coinbase, does it show up in GDAX?

Makes relatively little difference getting your coin into an exchange compared to a software or paper wallet.

Not sure what the laws are in the US, but in the UK you dont pay capital gains on anything below £11,300/year so I don't imagine it would be a problem for most on this side of the pond.
@_date: 2017-12-09 22:20:09

Because if its in any way true its a huge barrier for blockchain technology if it wants to become mainstream.

Excellent, thanks for that. So in short, it doesnt matter what i earn as a full time income (which is covered by income tax), as long as i dont earn over £11,300 on the crypto exchange i dont have to pay CGT?
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:20:29
Your sentiment is a good one, but until there is a stable value for bitcoin, most users arent going to spend because of the fear that what they pay one day will have cost them much less the next.

Market order just takes whatever the current market value is and buys instantly. Limit allows you to place an order where you decide which price to buy and sell at as well as allowing you to add other conditions.
Worth using the limit function if only because gdax doesn't charge any fees when you do. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 21:55:53
If only. Every man and his dog would start start selling their grandmothers to buy BTC at anything less than about 7200 right now and the price would shoot up again.

@_date: 2017-11-21 22:30:36
Of course it's taxable. If you make capital gains on a currency then you have to pay the man. The only time you usually dont have to pay tax is on gambling, which trading crypto certainly isn't classed as.
There's usually an allowance on how much capital gains you can make in a year before paying tax though. In the UK it's £11,300/pa.
Japan doesn't have this luxury though. Any capital gains is considered part of normal earnings so gets taxed at the full whack :(

Still waiting for a response from coinbase about this. Their customer services is one big pile of shit. Ive had issues in the past with them and never once had a reply to any of my tickets.
Ive basically brought a new customer through their doors and ive had nothing in return despite the promise of an insentive for doing so.
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:49:03
Catch 22. If you and everyone else like you knew what was coming, there would be a lot fewer owners of bitcoin and it wouldn't be worth what it is today.

24 hours is exactly the sort of window i want to avoid if theres a dip in the value. For me (and the op by the sounds of it), i only ever buy £100 at a time if its lying around, so the £4 flat fee is the same as 4% coinbase rate but you avoid the wait to buy.
@_date: 2017-11-20 10:52:01
Thanks, do you know the name of the account you use?
@_date: 2017-11-20 11:37:03
I assume you can then send money from your Coinbase/gdax wallet back into Revolut and then back into your normal UK bank account, all for no cost? Why do you exchange to euro rather than GBP by the way?

I like Martin Lewis and everything he says here is 100% correct. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 10:49:00
I usually buy in blocks of £100 so the £4 fee means that i may as well just use my debit card as that's 4%.
I also use GDAX, but youve got to make the transfer into your Coinbase account in the first place before moving it over to the GDAX exchange. Getting the money into the Coinbase wallet initially is what im trying to reduce the cost of. 
A bank account is 1.49% which is why im trying to find one that will work.
@_date: 2017-11-20 22:06:17
How are you planning to buy more in the future? 
@_date: 2017-11-27 20:46:53
I don't think it matters really. The idea of a whole coin is just an obsessive compulsion. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 20:58:02
Debit/Credit card via coinbase, move over to GDAX and set a limit buy. You'll have to eat a 4% fee though.
@_date: 2017-11-22 08:23:17
You pay a miners fee for sending btc from gdax to electrum as per above dont you?
@_date: 2017-11-21 09:02:15
You'll only have to pay tax on your returns if you cash it in. So guess what....
@_date: 2017-11-21 11:34:08
For me, the easiest way to buy is still through Coinbase on a debit card. You have to eat 4% fees, but bank transfers can take too long, which leaves you too open to jumps in the price. 
Once youve got your bitcoin though, use GDAX to trade. The coins can be transferred over to their exchange for free and if you use a limit buy/sell you avoid fees altogether.
Get yourself an alternative to storing your coin on the exchange though.
@_date: 2017-11-17 15:19:51
Cheers for the comments. So the fact that i have a full time job paying over the £11,300 limit puts me over the capital gains threshold by default? Or is it calculated separately from income tax so i can earn another £11,300 before being liable for CGT?
I assume that it has to be declared the following April?
@_date: 2017-11-29 10:29:49
Life is one great big bubble, enjoy it. This is the most fun ive ever had in potentially losing money.

I just took a look, seems like even after fees you get more BTC using debit card on coinbase than the higher cost but zero fees on bittylicious? 
My test figures were for £100, which got me 0.01461868 btc on coinbase. The same amount on bittylicious bought me 0.01414679 btc.
Unless im missing something?
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:29:08
HP sauce?
@_date: 2017-11-27 12:02:26
Yes, ive had my coinbase account for some time and always use it to buy btc. 
Only thing i can think thats happened is that hes ordered via a linked bank account rather than with a debit/credit card, so his order isnt actually fulfilled yet due to the 2 or so days it takes for money to transfer. Just find it odd that hes received his £7 already though if this is the case.
@_date: 2017-11-27 13:37:04
@_date: 2017-11-21 12:19:04
Yes, buy on coinbase, then transfer to the GDAX wallet if you want to trade. Transfer back to coinbase wallet when youre done trading. The fee is zero for coinbase &lt;-&gt; GDAX as theyre the same company.
In the long run, look into an alternative wallet, preferably a hardware wallet such as Trezor or Ledger Nano S because keeping your hard earned in an exchange wallet is risky. 
Im currently looking at Electrum as a software solution wallet, but even that isnt without its risks, so i may just bite the bullet and fork out for a hardware type.
@_date: 2017-11-21 16:09:49
Muchas gracias. So a relatively cheap way (fee wise) of accruing btc is to buy on Coinbase -&gt; move to GDAX -&gt; move to Electrum.
The only fee i'd pay would be the GBP to BTC when buying on Coinbase?
@_date: 2017-11-21 12:39:55

@_date: 2017-11-20 15:41:03
Thanks. I did notice on the Revolut website that standard transfers take up to 2 days though. The bull run that BTC is on right now means that its probably cheaper to eat the coinbase 4% fee and buy instantly than it is to wait 2 days and buy at a higher rate?
@_date: 2017-11-27 12:07:53
Send it to GDAX first though. You wont pay any fee that way.
