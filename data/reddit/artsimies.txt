Who is the one saying when something is public? Say i find an insane diamond hive full of flawless diamonda. Now if i use this info to my advantage is it insider trading? (Hint: no). How about if im watching a soccer practise and see 5 of the best players get injured.. if I use this info that is not yet known to most people to my advantage is that insider trading? Again, no.

If the market is this easily manipulated doesn't it mean there is an fundamental error in the market? Everyone keeps speaking about how great it is to be unregulated. Well, bitcoin is and now everyone blames manipulators for manipulating. You cant have good from both sides. Just deal with it, these will happen and one pretty much has to realize and accept it.

Yeah this is not insider trading. If you just find about something before someone else does and you act on it its not insider trading.

Well, he was a bit harsh by calling you stupid. But whether you up vote or down vote something has NOTHING to do with what SEC decides later on.

Thanks! But as strategosInfinitum above says there was no 12 word phrase stuff in 2013. So how to access it if there is no such thing? :/
