I would check your browser history.  Make sure you only visited the legit site.  There may be characters in the URL that look like the legit characters so check that too

real thing

he's surely aware of bitcoin. why not just ask him his thoughts first, see where he's coming from.  then maybe address concerns he may express to you in follow up emails.
@_date: 2013-08-29 21:45:22
annoying that it's hard to find. i thought i was going crazy 
@_date: 2013-09-09 22:59:18
Did Cointerra show up?  What did they say, if so??
@_date: 2013-08-17 14:16:25
that was not available for the victims of the supposed hack and theft.  we were just told to shut up and eat the loss.  never has an email to them been responded to.
@_date: 2013-09-08 02:12:52
my friend lost every bitcoin he tried to lend there. he is hating life and their support was zero help.  beware lending

outdated rigs can be used to mine litecoin, so they are holding value more than you would probably like them to
@_date: 2013-09-07 23:23:59
send me the wallet.dat, i'll do it for you for free ;)  
just kidding.  good luck with it!
@_date: 2013-09-11 23:51:58
cool, i hope you guys post it online if they present anything :)
@_date: 2013-11-23 08:33:35
bitfloor got hacked... and never returned funds :(
@_date: 2013-09-06 13:44:16
1. wait
2. buy a Ferrari 
@_date: 2013-10-01 17:21:47
feel free to show up even if you are not signed up for meetup.com.  it will be very informal. hope to see you there!
@_date: 2013-08-17 14:59:18
Can I suggest you change the title to reflect the truth?  
@_date: 2013-08-29 21:53:43
if you do, please let me know. they "lost" my btc too
@_date: 2013-09-06 13:32:50
they could change their terms and add escrow service for the big coins. they definitely need to protect sellers better

Please upvote for visibility :)

cluster boxes??
i love bitminter but be aware payouts are volatile based on it being a small pool.  much more of a gamble than a PPS pool. may pay great but may suck too depending on "luck". you may want to switch to a bigger PPLNS pool or to a PPS pool if you want more steady income.  
on bitminter click statistics -&gt; shifts
the "your work" column indicates your submitted work.  if it is blank, you have not been set up properly and not getting paid
also, payouts on bitminter and many mining sites' payouts are delayed by about 10 hours. 
you have some study ahead of you ;)
if you know your hashrate,  will tell you how much you should/could make. 
i think 50btc has a widget on the side to guess what you will make based on your hash rate
@_date: 2013-08-29 21:14:46
yup, long time lurker though :)
@_date: 2013-09-19 05:31:54
nice one
@_date: 2013-09-05 23:07:28
yes i got mine.  it is for sale for 50 BTC if anyone wants it. free next day shipping, 60 GH.  their blog with shipping dates has been accurate, unlike everything else they have said in the past. 
@_date: 2013-09-06 13:26:40
you should probably bury them or it will start to stink
@_date: 2013-09-13 08:40:41
@_date: 2013-09-14 04:00:50
it was posted on meetup.com
@_date: 2013-10-19 09:46:57
hmm, this isn't correct
@_date: 2013-08-17 14:10:45
same here. all my emails to support have been ignored.
@_date: 2013-10-17 06:54:15
bitfloor owes me BTC too.  if you have success, please let us other victims of bitfloor know how you did it
@_date: 2013-10-01 19:37:13
why is the icon for my reddit post the avatar of one of the meetup group members?  can i change the icon here to something else?
thank you for your support reddit!
@_date: 2013-08-29 21:51:54
he should be careful, sounds like a MSB to me, haha
@_date: 2013-08-17 04:43:48
Greetings Reddit.  Long time lurker just signed up to say that NO, I never got my 10 BTC back.  I am in the US.  They promised to repay them over time but never did!  They "lost" bitcoin then broke their promise to repay it.  
@_date: 2013-08-29 04:47:13
this guy doesn't know his napster from his bittorrent
