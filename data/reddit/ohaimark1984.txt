Virtually everybody involved with btrash gets paid for their loyalty to a misleading marketing narrative that purposefully causes brand confusion, and as consequence, loss of funds for new users.
Centralized Bitmain controlled BCH, is the last refuge for people like gavin andreesen rick valkvinge, jamie redman, etc etc. What these spineless people have in common is that they sold their coins way to early.
Roger and co give these losers one last chance at wealth and all they have to do is sell their soul and their good name to pump btrash.
These people along with other known con men use their previous image to collect little feeble minded cult idiots who are manipulated into a stupid following that make the scam look legitimate and community driven on the surface to untrained eyes.

Halving, small icos made profits, making sideliners start to notice the $$, then segwit won blocksize debate, proving miners don't control consensus even if they move hashpower and we have 1 hour blocks. Bcash turns out profitable to anyone who did't stay there, then fomo. Shitcoin fomo was literally just latecomers looking for cheap and hot "next bitcoin".

Do you have your seed? just pop it into Electrum. (samourai is in alpha though i'm using it with absolutely no issues.)
@_date: 2019-08-04 09:49:30
This works on more wallets than just this one but for the sake of this comment: Download "bitcoin lightning wallet" for android (non custodial),
Write down your seed, go to lnbig.com on your pc, adjust the blue bar to whatever capacity you would like in satoshi, click 'next'.
On your wallet app, tap the round orange 'B', tap 'open new channel'. Then tap the QR icon at the top, scan the qr that is shown to you on lnbig.com
Now, without having any btc in your wallet, a channel is being set up to you to receive and then send btc on lightning. Just wait for the initial confs.  Thats it.

I know many lost souls who use this crappy wallet for the other coin it supports so this metric from just bc.i is meh.
@_date: 2018-06-30 09:01:59
you can use custom fees in mycelim (scroll the fees to the side) and use this tool to see how many blocks will it roughly take at each sat/b 
I do recommend samourai, electrum, greenaddress (better yet- a Trezor) - wallets with better auto estimation and also SEGWIT fee reduction!! just don't forget to backup your seed
@_date: 2019-08-04 15:56:46
The liquidity provider does the tx to open the channel. This means the user doesn't need to have a btc balance to start recieving btc on lightning.  This is still not custodial in any way. I don't know about iphone, I don't use one.

Its simple, bitcoin isn't in its fair value. Its undervalued. When it is fiarly valued, bigger, and more stable, more hodlers will use it out of convenience if they have some they stored their value in. I, for one,  do spend btc on various things, lightning works great for me. I simply make sure to have a separate dca hodl in place for the future.

I find this correct, been here since namecoin though it might deserve a square at the bottom :)
@_date: 2019-10-14 13:44:24
This is basically the essence of bitcoin fud. Its too obvious that accountants and the like can simply claim the logic of not having to pay without a tax event actually happening. This to me sounds so stupid, it should and will be fixed soon enough, until then this is being spun into fud. 
I live in a country that copies all tax laws from the US, my accountant got me an approval to only pay taxes on forks after and when I sell the free btc that I received from them.

Does this mean I can receive Lightning payments without opening an on-chain transaction myself?  If I can receive a Lightning payment without making an on-chain transaction myself can I send that btc without making an on-chain transaction?

	Definition
Fiat money has been defined variously as:
Any money declared by a government to be legal tender.
State-issued money which is neither convertible by law to any other thing, nor fixed in value in terms of any objective standard.
Intrinsically valueless money used as money because of government decree.
An intrinsically useless object that serves as a medium of exchange (also known as fiduciary money.)
While gold- or silver-backed representative money entails the legal requirement that the bank of issue redeem it in fixed weights of gold or silver, fiat money's value is unrelated to the value of any physical quantity. A coin is fiat currency to the extent that its face value, or value defined in law, is greater than its market value as metal.
The term fiat derives from the Latin fiat ("let it be done") used in the sense of an order, decree or resolution.

Well, I do educate people about BTC. I've been doing it since 2012. It's practically my life. Please tell me more about missing out on gains. The reason I dislike the shitcoin trading noob hitchhikers happens to come from my disappointment in these people, doesn't matter how much you try educate them they keep being ignorant sheep, that is my impression from my own circles and experience. I spent a lot of wasted time trying to educate these noobs while they were pouring into the space like zombies for the wrong reasons (the ones that created this stupid bubble and made everyone run away like I said.) I also dislike the term "portfolio" it's pushed for late-coming mainstream folks who are totally oblivious to were and why all this actually started.

I appreciate and share your view. bit hard for me to explain my view in English, I just want to point out I was referring to the shitcoin bubble. I have no problem with bitcoin price bubbles they do bring publicity to bitcoin. So do the shitcoin pumps, but they come with the false pretense of "replacing" bitcoin and selling the idea of caching the next train to 20K ("muh under 1 dollar shitcoin gonna do a bitcoin"). ofc there are people who come for the money and stay for the decentralization of money, thats a common rabbit-hole journey some go through. Call me a purist maximalist, I just can't stand the riffraff shitcoin peddlers who show up make noise, scam some people and leave the cleaning up to us.

Werent you here to see the exact same comments aimed at people who claimed they wanted to sell when it reaches $1000 once again after getting "burned" by 2013 ath?

So it's now another kyc trap?
@_date: 2019-05-26 09:06:00
If you say so. I think you're just impatient. I've been spending just a bit here and there now, mostly on bitrefill using lightning. Bitcoin has more uses than just spending. Hell, saving is even more important in this day and age!

I know, I pay 25% on gainz. Haven't made a trade since 2016 besides dumping bcash.

It's all compatible. Some wallets are trying to make you think things are broken so you get confused and turn to a shitcoin they support.
Use segwit, don't use services or wallets who refuse to use it for sinister reasons eg: binance, blockchain dot com.
@_date: 2019-05-26 09:22:13
So youre a bcash shill? Shillax...
@_date: 2019-05-26 07:35:01
We're playing the long game. This is just another step in infiltrating tptb. While other shitcoins are just about 'when pump', btc is brewing, building. Patience, hodl for now..
@_date: 2019-05-26 08:19:05
Both real bitcoin and fake bcashcoin have 10 minutes in average blocks. So time of transaction is the same on average, if fee is enough. Saying bitcoin is slower is just misleading. The wallets were unreliable back then, and some are still to this day, not the bitcoin network. Bitcoin now has the lightning network, a second layer with instant and almost free transactions. Bcash is just a fraud centralized shitcoin supported by dodgy folks who thought "high" on-chain fees will stop adoption (muh gainz) (to the point of actually sabotaging wallets up to this day to try and make their point). They basically compromised decentralization and lack of a dictator for seemingly cheap on chain fees. A lot of propaganda was fed to the uninformed to make it seem like bcash was legitimate when its simply controlled by it's creators who were also trying to benefit from a mining advantage on it for themselves.

Huge influx? Its like 5%
@_date: 2019-05-16 07:40:02
Not only that, they do not support sending to segwit, this makes noobs think bitcoin is broken.
@_date: 2019-05-16 08:57:31
Shillax scammer.

That is very concerning. Run.

Was at a conference last week. A guy wanted to donate to the organizers who had a bech32 wallet. He tried paying with stupid bc.i, got mad it wouldn't work and blamed bitcoin. This is what bc.i want. Ofcourse I explained to him that he is having a scam bad user experiance problem and offered he moves to any other wallet basically.

There is no "real" utility, it is what you make of it for yourself. Bitcoin doesnt care. If you cant wait, nobody stopping you, use lightning its awesome. I'm going to wait until bitcoin is bigger and a few hundred satoshi buy my dinner to start using it for spending again. Hodling is a use also. I simply learned my lesson spending too many coins during 2014-2016. So for now, not worth the taxes.

Don't forget fing blockchain dot fing com.
Making noobs think bitcoin is broken since segwit.
@_date: 2019-05-17 12:05:51
I actually heard of someone with the same issue this week, he was sure of the password but it wouldnt work. He had to use the seed to restore. Blockchain dot fing com is the shittiest of all wallets.

@_date: 2019-05-11 12:10:20
Here you go. 
Word of advice, don't fall for the shitcoin scams. Do not believe scammers trying to sell you "the next coin to explode like bitcoin did". Bitcoin is the next bitcoin.

Do not use that shit wallet.
@_date: 2019-05-17 07:31:36
Ledger themselves only support wrapped segwit, that's why it worked. If you try sending from blockchain to bc1 address, not only does it break, they don't even tell you why.
