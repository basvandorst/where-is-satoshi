Minecraft/Mojang isn't a bit coin firm...
@_date: 2014-02-20 06:05:16
Or just say gooey and watch people go nuts.
@_date: 2014-03-27 04:58:32


wat. How the heck did you come up with that title?
@_date: 2014-04-21 05:59:13
So brave.
@_date: 2014-02-22 03:23:09
They got promoted.

Seems like snapcard doesn't list Canada in shipping.
@_date: 2013-12-07 18:26:50
@_date: 2013-12-06 20:52:56
Where else can BitCoins be sold?

I will try out the Android app as the site isn't showing any gift cards for me.
Edit: Apparently my two year old Galaxy Nexus isn't supported...damn.

I am looking into Electrum, I have a wallet with BTC on blockchain, how would I go about transferring to Electrum?
@_date: 2013-12-06 21:05:37
No one wants to sell locally where I live. Apparently my city is in the stone age.
@_date: 2013-12-06 20:39:02
It seems to have stabled at 300 seconds, so it isn't too bad for the lag.
@_date: 2013-12-06 19:02:32
I use  to watch for the market. I honestly think peple are just panicking a bit. 
@_date: 2013-12-06 01:35:13
Hate to sound like an idiot but right click exactly where? I might have downloaded the wrong Electrum program then. I have 1.9.5
Edit: Never mind, It shows 5 of them o.o, which one is mine?
@_date: 2013-12-07 17:57:59
The price to buy will be fixed at .2 BTC for as long as Bitcoin remains under $850 USD.
Edit: I will admit that it kinda weird. What happens if it hits above 850?
Edit 2: Plus it doesn't list where it ships &gt;.&gt;
@_date: 2013-12-05 22:07:53
Ah that might be it. Damn :(
@_date: 2013-12-06 01:25:51
Dur, thanks :D
@_date: 2013-12-06 21:29:22
So it was you who made mtgox go through a whirlwind :P
@_date: 2013-12-06 20:29:03
Im still seeing 3741857 seconds of lag. I don't think it is functioning again.
Edit: It keeps going low and then high.
@_date: 2013-12-06 21:10:09
Basically, was a great time to buy.
@_date: 2013-12-12 05:29:38
Ah, I didn't notice it 4 hours ago but I wasn't actively watching it.
Thanks for a response.
@_date: 2013-12-05 22:02:21
When I go to it, it shows not gift cards at all. Wat.
@_date: 2013-12-05 22:03:53
Will do. Thanks!
Edit: Apparently my two year old Galaxy Nexus isn't supported...damn.
@_date: 2013-12-12 05:05:56
For a whole seven minutes? What the hell happened xD
@_date: 2013-12-07 18:35:51
Really wish GFYT would come to Canada :(
@_date: 2013-12-06 01:36:07
I did have it on, and on the process of doing that right now. Thanks :D
@_date: 2013-12-06 20:53:42
It had the same halt/crash that happened last April. Basically caused Bitcoin to drop a big chunk.
@_date: 2013-12-06 21:51:23
It was a feature. Basically what happened is when someone overloaded the server it went into a repeat mode. Trying to process the transaction after each repeat section and if it failed, it went to repeat again and try.
Does that make more sense?
TL;DR - It was a security feature. A shitty one
@_date: 2013-12-07 18:04:11
Here is the issue I have.
 costs 34.50
Converted to bitcoin at 777 is
0.04597 and you ask for .2? Are you including shipping or? Because that is quite a markup.
@_date: 2013-12-06 22:36:41
Yep. The lag was so bad it was basically trading without knowing if it was good or bad.
@_date: 2013-12-06 01:36:54
Fantastic! Thanks for your help! :D
@_date: 2013-12-06 01:20:00
Exactly. Buy low and sell high.
@_date: 2013-12-06 01:58:38
Sorry :(
@_date: 2013-12-07 17:59:05
Where can you ship to?
@_date: 2013-12-06 01:32:19
I can't seem to find my wallet id on the electrum program...
@_date: 2013-12-06 20:57:24
My bad, thanks.
@_date: 2013-12-07 18:15:31
That is a crap ton of redbull xD
@_date: 2013-12-07 18:08:42


Can you please elaborate on that? I am kinda new to bitcoin but know a bit.
Edit: I would honestly go with it auto adjusting to what the bitcoin price is (Like every other store does)
@_date: 2013-12-06 20:54:42
Someone basically caused the server to nearly crash. Causing the value of BitCoin to drop incredibly during that period.
