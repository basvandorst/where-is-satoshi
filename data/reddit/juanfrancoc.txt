Argentinian here, knowing my country, is more likely a rougue it employee saw the chances and set it up. How is starbucks going to make significant profit from 10 second mining sessions in 1 city?

I think it only mines in the redirect page which only last for 10 seconds as if the user navigates it wouldn't load that javascript (unless they are doing some crazy proxy manipulation which i think is a little bit too much)

This is the thing, and even though i dont think bitcoin will fall, i do see why people identifies it with a bubble. Every time a bubble appeared was basically due to the hype of peole buying something at a price higher than it's intrinsic value in hopes for re selling it later as a higher price. This inflates the price until people can no longer afford to buy and the prices starts dropping.
I think bitcoin is different than anything we have seen before, but i cant deny it does not fit into the definition of bubble. Lets hope the newcomers dont  panic when bitcoin falls a bit bursting it.

I knew it was going up, maybe up to a $1000 (when it was 200) but the trouble of getting some in argentina at that time was too much to bother. I then though at 8000 that i missed the bus. I then bought at 10000 because fuck it i m having a hell of a time just being in the loop. This communitty (while little over optimistic) is great place to hang out.

How is that any different from a bank's savings account if they were to use bitcoins?

Stable =/= profitable

Yeah, last time i checked dollar went 200% then back down 70% in just a couple of months

This! People do not understand being able to transfer money is not the only way banks are profitable. Loans, savings accounts, mortgage are all services a bank provides and that bitcoin cannot replace. Bitcoin will allow to let everyone work outside the system, but it will not wipe out the system at all, and that's the key.
