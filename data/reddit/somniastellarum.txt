To be fair, Doug regularly says he doesn’t know everything in crypto so he might have got that wrong. I thought I’d heard that before though, but I could be wrong.

Haha, also the MLK bit had me in stitches. Doug is on point with his edits. Awesome videos.

That's partly why I posted this video here. Look at my past posting history, I don't tend to go for the cheap karma. And in this video in particular, Doug actually called out r/Bitcoin along with r/BTC. Can r/Bitcoin do better? I think so. But I also think how they've reacted to what Bcash and Roger in particular have done is understandable. Also, as subs grow rational discussion tends to be replaced by meme'ing. I'd like to see more constructive discussions here, but we'll see if it happens.

... Hello Roger! Lol

Doug Polk Dump n' Pump scheme confirmed! First BCC took a dive after his video and now BCH!

Yeah, does his homework really well and still won’t bullshit you when he doesn’t know something. I find too many people in crypto become “experts” when they actually don’t know a lot, but would never admit that. Doug is like the antidote to those people.

I think this video is more than just an insulting take on Ver. Doug is teaching people to think critically about what people are saying and what they’re intentions are. He’s well researched and doesn’t focus on details that don’t matter on particular topics. Is a bigger block size better? I don’t think the answer to that is entirely clear either way. But what is certain is that Roger Ver is sowing confusion by trying to take the Bitcoin brand. What’s worse is this means many new people to crypto are being suckered by this and losing money (by transferring btc to a bch wallet) or being sold a bill of goods that wasn’t true (Bcash is Bitcoin).

What’s your time horizon on that? I wouldn’t be so sure over the long term.

I heard an interview with someone from Zencash. They talked alot about Zcash and they really don't hate them. They see what they're doing as different, but they seemed to really respect the Zcash team. Not everything has to be antagonistic. Which is what is such a shame about what is happening with Bcash.

I happened to be on twitter and saw Doug post about how awesome this video would be. After watching it, I was somewhat surprised it hadn’t been posted here yet. I guess I win a bit of karma. Lol.

With proper incentives they shouldn’t be. Maybe that’s the problem.
