That’s how inefficient markets work

More goes into an efficient market than information symmetry. There’s also a lot of amateur investors that can’t rationally price the market. And even if you were rational, how would you?
Maybe measure the elasticity of demand for bitcoin? 
Scientifically that would be a start. But would be hard to do with a sample size of 2
Even if sample size weren’t a problem, how many people could rationally price bitcoin with basic economics of demand and supply dynamics?
Are you saying that because there are a lot of unsophisticated investors trading that therefore the market is more  efficient?
That’s highly unlikely.

The efficient market hypothesis, that all public market information is factored into the price of an asset has its flaws in relation to bitcoin. Not all market participants are able to transact in bitcoin equally, causing inefficiencies in the market and price discovery. Secondly, most participants in the market are unsophisticated retail investors, even if some institutional and big play money can participate in a small capacity. Unsophisticated retail investors don’t act as rationally and therefore aren’t very good at pricing events, decreasing the case for an efficient market. Thirdly, in order to rationally price, we would have to have a solid understanding of the elasticities of bitcoin. We have a sample size of two supply shocks. This is statistically insignificant, making an efficient market hypothesis even more shaken.
Efficient market hypothesis works in efficient markets. Bitcoin is not even close to an efficient market for many reasons and therefore current price probably doesn’t reflect all information available to market participants.

No requirement to actually track the price of bitcoin. The way it interacts with the larger market is more derivative. It has the legal equivalence of a penny stock.

Trades at a significant premium to the price of bitcoin
