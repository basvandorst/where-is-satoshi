Basically your critique of warlordism is that democracy is superiour to it.  Which is apparently true, judging by how well modern day western democracies fare compared to third-world warlord states.
But the problem you have is that you think that 'Group A' is anarchy, when in fact, 'Group A' is more like a democratic government.

99% of those real jobs would disappear in the absense of a government.
All public utilities and services are maintained and run by a government.  Without a government to enforce collective payment for utilities and services, they will disappear almost literally overnight.
Without these essential public services and utilities, the rest of society will collapse by the next day.  You can't run a factory without electricity.  You can't stock a supermarket without transportation.
If anything, SouporBonBon's scenario is ridiculously overly optimistic.  I think that if government magically disappeared tomorrow, about 5 minutes after people realized what had happened, rioters and looters would be overrunning the streets while dudes with guns blow away anyone that gets close to their home/business.  It would be total chaos for days or weeks until enough people get killed and enough of the survivors get hungry enough to start working together rationally to solve the sudden colossal problems they face.  And that's when government forms again.  Anarchy--that's the period of total chaos and violence and destruction before people get desperate enough to form mini-governments of their own for basic survival needs.
