He falls into the drivers seat of a Lambo THEN is smashed by a truck and dies. Crypto giveth and crypto taketh away.

Seems on topic to me. Anyways I read somewhere that when difficulty rises so does price. Couldn't make sense of it, but I figured someone here probably would have some ideas.. not guesses..

Your June 1st price is about $1k off
@_date: 2017-07-29 02:59:29
Yea I will. Better not to be greedy. I tend to lose when I act on greed.

I do. I know it'll recover. As long as it's the mainstream cryptocurrency it will always recover until something takes its place. Cryptocurrencies are the future, and as far as I'm concerned they are at the very early stages of their lifespan.

I DO want the free BCC! But it wouldn't be worth it if BTC tanks, then I HAVE to HODL as opposed to selling now and buying low (potentially VERY low) after. That a lot of lost opportunity! I really want to know if you all think the price will tank on the day of.
@_date: 2017-07-29 02:48:01
Only bc I'm uncertain if btc will actually tank on aug 1st or not. If it decides to take an upswing I'll be at a loss. I'm 80% sure it'll tank at least for the day but not sure enough just yet. What do you think
@_date: 2017-07-29 02:48:35
Also some exchanges will not operate the day of so I may not be able to take advantage of that
@_date: 2017-07-29 04:50:11
I disagree. I think hodling is the rational way to go. But like you said, the market being the irrational clusterf**k that it is will most likely dip due to fear. I will hodl but I know I'll regret missing an opportunity to increase my holdings :(

You clearly don't see the potential of Blockchain technology. I pity the fool

@_date: 2017-07-29 04:10:20
I'm confused, can you explain
@_date: 2017-07-29 03:26:51
I'll consider this. Thanks!
@_date: 2017-07-29 20:03:37
For me, my goals are that of a trader. I just want to make money on the fluctuation and hodl afterward. I'm fairly confident btc will recover. I don't care what bch does, not my cup of tea.
Edit: I'm thinking to hodl 60% and trade with 40%
@_date: 2017-07-29 13:01:20
I disagree 
@_date: 2017-07-29 13:03:01
Happily 
@_date: 2017-07-29 02:31:44
there lies the opportunity! should i not sell now and buy low so when it goes up again i can profit :D
@_date: 2017-06-24 02:20:40
They have outages on peak trading days and they've been known to freeze accounts. For small amounts, go for it. As for me, I'll stick to cold storage. 
@_date: 2017-06-24 01:18:55
Good call not keeping any btc in Coinbase 
@_date: 2017-07-29 06:32:13
Haha no that would be stupid. I just understand the technology and its potential, that's all.
