We have contacted Bitcoin Cloud Services to get to the bottom of the allegations. If they cannot prove that they are a legitimate business we will remove their ads immediately. They have 24 hours to get in touch with us.
I would say it is a difference between "Supporting" and "Advertising".
Thank you for your article Kyle.

Sure, that's fine.

What are your thoughts on this piece?
@_date: 2014-06-05 11:08:06
As a sponsored story that is clearly marked, yes.
@_date: 2014-12-07 11:51:48
That was a bit harsh wasn't it?
@_date: 2014-12-07 11:52:03
How can you confirm this?
@_date: 2014-07-14 08:32:47
btw, please also update this sentence: 
CCN apparently marks the stories as sponsored. Still, they are letting people buy links essentially and that should still be discouraged.
@_date: 2014-11-26 16:27:31
CCN is always on the lookout for talented writers.

Thank you. We do strive to provide the Bitcoin community correct and accurate information. And my offer stands, you're a talented journalist. 
@_date: 2014-06-05 10:37:22
Those articles have been written by 3 people. None of us have talked to each other about "bashing" Bitcoin together. It is a coincidence. 
-&gt; The "Downfall of Bitcoin" articles are pure fiction as stated in the beginning of the articles. 
-&gt; The ATM-story is a true story that deserved to be published. Do you wish that we didn't cover negative stories about Bitcoin and become "Bitcoin Corrupted"? 
-&gt; The Bitcoin price in Freefall is a typical story that drives traffic and debate which all news sites need. Take it as it is.
People write bullish stuff about Bitcoin on CCN, people write bearish stuff about Bitcoin. Sometimes there may be more negative news than positive, that's just how it is.
All authors on CCN are completely free to write whatever they want. I will not trash a post because it is "not in the interest of CCN". All articles and debate drives traffic.
Since some readers don't like the promotion of Coinaaa that was only meant to be a stable supplement to Bitcoin (Bitcoin is too volatile to be used for payments) - I have removed the Coinaaa banners for the time being.

It can be read that we "SEO" pump websites that "buy links". We are not doing that due to the disallow in our robots.txt file. However, if you just talk about buying a nofollow (noindex) link then you should at least explain that. It would be the same as buying google link ad or a normal ad on CCN.

You were not paid for the last month? Where is the email asking for the payment that you did not receive? As I can recall, everything was paid Tom Boice. If you can prove otherwise and this is a blunder from me I will of course pay you what we owe.
@_date: 2015-01-25 10:44:38
We are growing like never before :-)

Thanks for the support. Unfortunately we had to make a stand.

What others? I believe its something with your encryption that you have in your email. Do another email and I'll forward you the emails I sent you. BTW: I have never been contacted by any other for your part. Ask them to give you a screenshot of the emails/forward em.

We have a talented staff. I do not share your thoughts.

Does Reddit, Google, or Bitcointalk vet all their advertisers?
@_date: 2015-01-24 23:14:01
That it consist of true independent journalists. Sponsored Stories are clearly marked, just like sponsored stories on any other news outlet.
@_date: 2014-08-03 08:30:15


We do sponsored stories which are clearly marked and in its own separate category:

Why is CCN one of the "bad guys" here?
@_date: 2015-01-24 23:14:58
Thank you.
@_date: 2015-01-24 20:16:18


I have addressed this. Again, this is not the meaning of CCN, but of the author. Please see the difference. 
@_date: 2015-01-24 20:05:41


Ehm? We tweet all our articles twice, no matter which one. It's auto, no one else is in control of the Twitter account. 
@_date: 2015-01-07 14:06:19
Then you have ignored my emails. Kyle, this is below your standard. Not impressed.
@_date: 2015-01-24 20:18:18
I only post unique and exclusive stories only found on CCN that I believe is bringing value to the Bitcoin community.
@_date: 2015-01-24 20:16:58


@_date: 2015-01-07 07:43:38
Btw; I have sent you multiple emails about your last payment without receiving any response. I can prove that as well.
@_date: 2015-01-24 17:02:42
Do people really believe we would need to make a bot like that? Reddit traffic counts for less than 5%. And for clarification: No, we do not have a Reddit bot down voting posts.

You can do a sponsored story for 250 USD that will be posted in our category "Sponsored Stories".

Don't agree with you.

I'm still here, was out for dinner. Scott Fargo, as far as I am aware, has not received any bonus/salary from GAW. If that's the case, I would need to address that as well.
@_date: 2015-01-24 23:13:27
We want to cover all major Bitcoin news for our readers.
@_date: 2015-01-24 23:11:08
Of course. We remove all ads that are proven to be scams with evidence.

@_date: 2015-01-07 07:26:57
Wow Kyle. Just wow.
@_date: 2015-01-24 20:07:22
Please elaborate.

1. We do not support PayCoin. They bought ads on CCN, just like companies buy ads on BitcoinTalk and Reddit. 
2. Our material is written by independent authors/journalists. We have had stories about PayCoin that is both positive, but also negative. 
Stories by authors/journalists on CCN are not necessarily the meanings of CCN, they are independent. 
Stories about PayCoin:

We have a lot of exclusive news. Just take a look at our recent news. And no, I'm extremely proud of what we are accomplishing together. If you truly love Bitcoin, you should start backing all the serious companies that work to promote Bitcoin. We have from 300 000 to 400 000 unique users a month with more than 1 million pageviews, that's promoting Bitcoin isn't? 
Would you want us to quit promoting cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin?

That is your right.

Gavin Andresen: “I think it would take anywhere from six months to a year to actually roll out that change. We have a soft fork going on, on the network now. I will be looking at how long it takes that to roll out to the majority of the network, to give me a better estimate on that.
And I’m not sure how exactly we would roll out that change. We might actually pick a date and say, eight months from now everybody is going to be validating these bunch of blocks. That would be the proposal, and that actually makes a fair bit of sense, because a hard fork is the kind of change where you need a kind of a flag day when it upgrades. As that kind of change affects both, it effects all footholds, not just the miners.”
