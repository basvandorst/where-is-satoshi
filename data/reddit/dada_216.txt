Everybody always forgets the deep web.
Bitcoin and crypto in general are already fungible, either you can make it so that you make deep web drugs market website disappear altogether or you show those people a better way to arrange that without crypto or btc is already worth more than zero because it’s the only way to make payment in a specific market.
Good or bad there already is a market where there’s no other alternative to btc and something tells me that that illegal deep web drugs markets are not not gonna disappear overnight.

its' fake conservatives vs. fake democrats. 
Do remember that people ALWAYS get the politicians they deserve.
I'm Italian and I've been living abroad since a long time, including in the US and I've learned one thing: You guys elected consumerism as your inner most deep value and this is what you get, fake conservatives vs. fake republicans selling everything off.
there's not much left to do now, china is the only place in the world where they still have a chance of real politics (if they take down the Communist party)

I was in since June, I had ppl call me over in November and by Christmas I was a "crypto portfolio manager", my "customers" are still in and even tho they're not as hyped as before they are not just waiting for an ATH, they're adopting! in their business, in their lives, in their banking, etc.
