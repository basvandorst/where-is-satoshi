Ignorance is Bliss!!
Until the tsunami hits him and the banks. 
Guys it’s over by the shouting but most financial types have their heads buried in the sand in deep denial. 
It’s sad how in history the nay sayers are always the ones who haven’t a clue but have a soapbox to try and convince the herd but by the time it’s over they won’t know what’s hit them. 
The times are a changing, so be open, educate yourself and be willing to look outside the box.

I agree a silly question as most of the holders today bought in at $10K-$15K as all the others cashed in when they doubled, tripled or even 10x  their profits. I bet there are very few holders today from 2008-2016 as most took the money and ran, except for Satoshi who has never sold a single one of his blocks. That’s my two cents. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 06:17:55
What did you buy in at? 
I bought at $5K, sold at $8K, bought back in at $6K and ride it to $16K, then moved to alts and quadrupled my holdings. Just moved back into BTC yesterday and dumped alts

I use Coinjar. Easy to deposit funds at specified Tatts lotto stores or via BSB hooking up your bank account. The downside is they only offer BTC, ETH and Litecoin, no EOS.

This guy lost all his credibility when he commented on EOS. The anti EOS sentiment is so apparent. He’s obviously oblivious to all the incredible dApps been rolled out on EOS. Everipedia, Emanate, Dmail, Karma, sense chat, Murmur, Prospector (amongst the many games, and not too forget the imminent launch of Voice. Sad to see so many wannabes who have backed the wrong horses as we witness block.one and it’s $4B war chest start to roll.

Amazing watching the predictable manipulation. This battle of the pump and dump whales started half an hour before the CBOE options expiration today. 
@_date: 2018-09-10 02:26:32
To hedge against the falling AUD. 
@_date: 2018-09-19 22:58:36
But this needs to happen more often. Each time a whale dumps we need a whale to pump immediately and burn all the shorties in the process. That’s my dream!! 
@_date: 2018-09-16 00:16:20
It’s amazing that a handful of whales can keep it down. Each time I see a large uptick it’s gets neutralised by these whales. I’m surprised that the big boys (Winkekvoss and Co) aren’t playing the opposite game and pushing up the value especially with such a large holding, or maybe they’re playing the same game. 
Just HOLD for now as an ETF is imminent in my opinion and they’ll need to buy hundreds of thousands of BTC to meet the requirements as the financial boys see the value of Blockchain. One thing for sure is that  it’s expanding daily and there’s no stopping it. The nay sayers sadly have no understanding of the mechanism of Blockchain (BTC) or any appreciation of how blockchain is on the verge of changing all our lives forever. (EOS). 
Remember in the early days of email the US Postal service indicated it that email wouldn’t impact US mail and it would only be used by business (haha), in the same way as when Gates /Ballmer started Microsoft for home computers people said “why would anyone want a computer in their home?”
Buy BTC, hold one each for your kids and they (and you too) will be well rewarded. 
That’s my two cents. 
@_date: 2018-09-16 21:59:59
Fantastic. If you could enhance it so that it tracks all the EOS airdrops as they occur you’ll definitely be onto something big, as EOS will be ramping up fast this weekend at the London hackathon. I’m sure you could earn Satoshis for this app. Cheers.

Agreed!!! Those who can trade on the US markets especially within tax free accounts have Greyscale’s GBTC fund available(OTC), which is an amazing day trading product especially with BTC volatility. Who needs more Wall Street toys for manipulation.

So what can they do about it? We all know it happens even in the fiat markets, where at least they can file charges against the manipulators, but in crypto they’ll  have to charge a few unknown whales somewhere in the ocean of crypto. Go figure.

That’s ok as GBTC is the best trading tool for BTC, so it’s perfect for day traders, with zero tax implications. Nothing better out there. Easy to play for $4.99 an order.

I’m doing a similar thing but I’m using my rollover IRA and buying Fidelity’s GBTC so I don’t have any tax implications. I did extremely well last time on the bull run so I’m building up my GBTC position on every dip as BTC is a no brainer in my mind. Good luck to all the longs as our reward day is coming soon.

In my opinion Coinbase are floundering having lost so much market share and business due to their favouritism for ETH over EOS due to their in bed relationships at the the top of the respective organizations. EOS is growing fast and so many people are switching to Binance to get access to EOS. Looking forward to June for a B1 blockbuster release. 
@_date: 2019-03-11 09:49:09
You’re totally right that it is contrary to best practices as it’s a retirement account, but putting 10-20% of your long term retirement funds in BTC is a good bet in my mind, especially at today’s prices. Each to their own, but I’m a BTC believer (and a bit of a punter) being able to day trade BTC via GBTC without tax implications is a dream come true. All the best!!

GBTC is the best investment for your IRA. With BTC volatility you can swing trade at $4.95 a trade and no capitals tax implications. GBTC is a superb BTC vehicle especially today with the premium so low. There is nowhere else to get access to BTC so recommending the poster to buy bitcoin directly is a joke as you have to cash in your IRA and pay taxes. Idiot poster.

I use both Binance lite / Binance and Coinjar exchanges. 
Coinjar let’s you BSB directly to deposit AUD and then you can buy BTC, XRP, BCH and LTC. - very limited. Coinjar also lets you deposit at certain Tattslotto stores. 
Binance lite lets you also deposit cash directly at a tattslotto and then you transfer into your Binance account where most alt’s are available. 
These are both exchanges and not ideal for leaving your tokens there, so move them to a wallet.

GBTC which is an OTC traded stock is available to most US IRA account holders who wish to take a position in BTC.  Your share price is based on  1/100th of a BTC plus there is a significant premium that folks pay for the easy access and no tax implications in an IRA. Greyscale hold roughly 175,000 BTC coins and this is the underlying asset for these shares, so you don’t actually own any BTC or impact the price in BTC in anyway by investing here, but it can be lucrative way to invest some of your retirement funds if you believe in BTC, 
@_date: 2018-06-17 10:47:04
Thanks for your thoughts. I would have assumed that in countries where governments have restricted crypto that a lot of money would have gone underground which would drive up the demand of BTC, but maybe my assumption is incorrect. Thanks.

@_date: 2018-06-17 08:25:48
Here’s an extract and thought process behind the recent decline. 
In his market report, released on Thursday, Lee cited a theory by Justin Saslaw on bitcoin expiration. Mr. Saslaw discovered that ever since the CBOE bitcoin futures launched at the end of 2017, there have been six expirations, including the latest one on June 13th.
In the 10 days preceding the expiration, the BTC price has dipped by 18% on average, before going on to recover approximately six days after the expiration. Thus, based on this theory we can expect the crypto markets to be in the green for the next couple of days at least.
Mr. Lee went on to explain the price movement in more detail, saying that, “If a trader is long Bitcoin and short the futures, as contracts move closer to expiry, holders may sell a large share of the coins at volume weighted average price (VWAP) to minimize tracking error. But near expiration, may sell the remaining Bitcoin, causing the price to drop, leaving the short position in the futures to close with a handsome profit.”

Look at the red ink across BTC and the alt markets. I have been tracking all major indexes across global markets against BTC and the top 5 alts and whenever we see a significant downturn in the cryptos we have found a correlation between BTC and the stock markets where they lag the performance by around 24 hours. Do your own research and you’ll find a very similar pattern. 
@_date: 2018-03-25 09:14:32
I think the whales need a much larger range for BTC to swing for them to make any serious money. They dump 500 BTC’s and drive the price down try to accumulate 1,000 -2,000 BTC’s from the weak hands. Why aren’t they letting the price run up higher and then dump the coins, unless they’re competing amongst themselves which would explain the narrow range we’re currently in $6-$$10K. In my opinion it’s just a matter of time before we break this range to the upside.

Pity you don’t understand GBTC. It’s the most lucrative way of investing in BTC. It’s based on 1/100 of a BTC (they have around 175,000 BTC in cold storage). You can trade it from an IRA without tax implications and can day trade in a few seconds as BTC goes up or down. It doesn’t always track the price of BTC as premium is the variable. I actually have friends who trade the premium so they are stocking up right now. No risk of being hacked, no need for a wallet and no need to be a techie. I’ve made a small fortune trading GBTC and for me it’s been the most lucrative flexible investment vehicle to have an indirect position in BTC. That’s my two cents...
@_date: 2018-07-26 22:23:17
The GBTC premium is determined by the supply and demand of GBTC shares. It has ranged between 40%-90% and right now is at a low premium of around 45% which is a buy time for me. I think the premium will rocket now that the first ETF has stalled
@_date: 2018-07-27 15:11:24
