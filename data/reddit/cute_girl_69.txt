the answer is simple, because they can. just because you disagree with it doesn't make it wrong. and no this is nothing like windows, unless you think bitcoin is owned by a company who makes money of it. you're not that stupid..... are you?

It's their appstore they can remove anything they want. What about that don't you get?
@_date: 2014-02-06 13:08:06
Lolwat do you understand how stupid what you just said is? How is apple not wanting bitcoin in their store being anti competitive? 
@_date: 2014-02-07 02:45:09
Nope you specifically stated that what Apple is doing is wrong under a law voted for by the people, stop changing your story, it's only making you look stupid and desperate. You should also learn the difference between LOSE and LOOSE.

Still more than the "sources" you say exist saying bitcoin is perfect.
@_date: 2013-10-21 11:26:20
For the last time, your DIRECT QUOTE, which you said MORE THAN ONCE IN THIS THREAD is that you could find at least 5 sources claiming bitcoin was perfect and would reach a thousand dollars within a year. You can't. You are wrong and a liar.
@_date: 2013-10-21 10:48:16
It's not holding onto the last point I had. It was the first and only point I have had all along. You kept saying you could find many sources showing bitcoin is perfect and will be up to a thousand dollars in a year.
Direct quotes:




So far you have failed to provide a single source that saying anything close to that.


That is exactly the point, from your quotes, that was your claim, which I am waiting for you to back up.

Really? This is what this subreddit has become? Shitty, overused reactiongifs?
@_date: 2013-12-23 05:20:48
Actually no, I'm still right. I never said it wouldn't get to a thousand, I said he couldn't find one reputable source at that time which said it would. Which I was right about. Sorry to make YOU look like the FOOL. but you have very poor comprehension skills.
@_date: 2013-12-23 05:38:18
I don't care, you just made yourself look like an idiot not me.
@_date: 2013-10-21 10:09:47
The thing is, I just want to see ONE source that he claims shows that bitcoin is perfect and will reach a thousand dollars in a year from anything but a personal blog.
@_date: 2013-12-19 08:40:00
The gasps of a dying currency.
@_date: 2013-10-21 08:42:50
Which are...? You still haven't given any of these sources claiming bitcoin is perfect and will surge to a thousand within a year.
@_date: 2013-10-21 09:42:18
No, you can't post any that aren't "uncle joe's blog" that support you.
@_date: 2013-11-18 05:28:46
What other post? There are no other comments here.
@_date: 2013-10-21 08:20:19
Ok, find me 5 sources as least as reliable as forbes and the washington post, saying that bitcoin is perfect.
@_date: 2013-10-15 09:38:11
*85 CHUMPS attended. FTFY.
@_date: 2013-10-21 08:02:44
Yes, 5 sources surely isn't enough!
@_date: 2013-10-21 10:38:04
Having potential is nowhere near "perfect"as you have stated over and over, try again.
@_date: 2013-10-21 11:36:58
I am arguing that so far the OP has made multiple claims that he can find more than 5 sources that show bitcoin is perfect and so far he has provided none.
