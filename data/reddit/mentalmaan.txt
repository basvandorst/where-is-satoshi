What if McDonald's starts selling CocaCola and only call it Coke. CocaCola would be pretty annoyed.
Bitcoin cash and Bitfinex calling it Bcash is exactly the same.
@_date: 2017-11-28 09:18:12
Yeah my bad, I didn't read properly.
My point still stands: Segwit devs have been lucky enough to keep BTC. Both fork are just solution to scaling. I'll keep it simple and refer to both the fork as Bitcoin (-&gt; the technology) SegWit (-&gt; the fork), same for Bitcoin cash.

Bitcoin segwit if you prefer

Satoshi said bitcoin will be the longest chain. I think he is right. Why not leave Bitcoin Cash enthusiasts alone and see what's last?
@_date: 2017-11-28 10:03:57
Well let it be then, if BTC is better in every point why bother with its fork?
@_date: 2017-11-28 10:02:12
The context is just not the same. But if, like this sub does, the subreddit pushes a company to use a other name for a product, it's bad.
At Coca cola scale, it is not, at Bitcoin scale, it is.

Until the 21m btc, bitcoin also have inflation
@_date: 2017-11-28 10:14:02
I think we are both worrying about it since you wouldn't bother responding to me if you weren't.
rCocaCola has 9k readers for a multinational corporation known since 1900. rbitcoin has 450k readers for some very new digital currency. You want more context?
@_date: 2017-11-28 09:51:54
Because they are here since the 1900. Bitcoin cash is here since August. Come on.

Some 2010 boi mined on his moms computer thousands of coins but lost it when mom restored the PC. Yet his address is worth millions.

That volume after 15:10 don't seem realistic though, maybe USDT helped a bit?
@_date: 2017-11-28 08:55:09
Less fees, faster confirmations, no RBF, on-chain scaling, the list goes on...
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:29:05
If the other sub doesn't talk a lot about future plans, it's only because there's only small fixes left to care about in the near future. You CANNOT deny the fact that BTC fees are higher than the fork. Both are at the same 24h volume, yet BTC has 10000 times more unconfirmed tx.
I don't get how Satoshi HAD to go wrong on BTC scaling. It is not a religion, it is not even a "vision", Satoshi just happened to know its technology and know how to scale. The only thing he did not plan was ASIC mining...
And you are right, Chinese ASIC mining in a heavily regulated country is centralized, and it's like that for years. Yet nobody didn't really care.
BTC isn't working the way it used to. Only because some people refuse to listen to Satoshi, sadly. Then again, you are right, let's be educated and see through what's happening.

What about Bcore and Bcash then? Or Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin Cash? Seems only fair
@_date: 2017-11-28 08:05:54
There's no dip if tether keeps expending the bubble
@_date: 2017-11-28 08:36:14
Pretty sure Ver admitted it by saying "bitcoin cash is bitcoin", and I don't agree.
What's not fair is that exchanges and other crypto services take their time to rename it Bcash. By your logic they should also rename bitcoin by Bcore, because that's what it is.
Or you could have Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin Cash. This is equality.
@_date: 2017-11-28 09:31:24
From what I can see BCH has no problem after a simple block size increase.
Whatever I'm personally using ETH for most of my transactions, but ETH has nothing to do with BTC scaling issue.
It has been proven many times that bigger blocks does not lead to centralization. Even Moore's law proves it. Blockstream only offered a SegWit less than 20% uses, and lighting is months away and a year late. Plus it isnt even on-chain.
If blockstream fixes bitcoin scaling issue for good, I'll give it a try, but for now, I'm using a bitcoin that works.
@_date: 2017-11-28 09:01:17
You don't agree with segwit? Your logic does not make sense.
@_date: 2017-11-28 08:02:18
Bitfinex is not an example to follow though
