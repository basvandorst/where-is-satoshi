@_date: 2014-02-19 08:21:12
Yes this point is so important. I see a lot of people claiming that the current systems are superior because they have insurance, charge backs, air miles, fraud reimbursement etc. for "free". Except that one of the most fundamental concepts in economics is that nothing is free, someone somewhere is in someway paying for those services whether they are aware of it or not.
Bitcoin is agnostic when it comes to insurance and fraud prevention. It allows for competing systems to be developed on top of it to provide these functions. It also gives consumers the option to opt out of all these "protections" altogether and save money in the process once companies start to pass the savings (many already have like gyft and overstock).

Coinbase fee is 1% and they wave it for the first $1,000,000. Yes, that's right, one million.[1]
Bitpay has plans that work on a flat monthly fee, meaning with high enough volume that I no doubt steam would achieve, the fee as a percentage becomes infinitesimal.[2]
Also, talking about third party risk is laughable when the alternatives are credit cards, where payments can be reversed for weeks, and paypal where payments can be similarly reversed or your account frozen for no good reason. Bitcoin payment processors pay out in fiat every 24 hrs so the 3rd party risk is MUCH lower than the status quo.

Get a cheap used laptop/netbook and put armory on it. You can create unsigned txns in an online armory wallet, transfer to offline computer for signing via USB flash drive, and finally broadcast the txn via the online wallet. Voila, you have virtually bulletproof security AND the ability to transfer funds in and out of cold storage with ease.
Armory is full of awesome features such as deterministic wallets, m of n paper backups, message signing, coin control, customizable mining fee, among many others.

All I'm saying is address reuse is bad for privacy. When it comes to having to provide personal details to coinbase you can have your own opinion. You can generate individual addresses without requiring personal information of course, but wikipedia and/or coinbase chose to do so. When you reuse addresses though, you leak information to the whole world since the blockchain is public.

Consider this: if an asic manufacturer produced a highly profitable miner, why wouldn't they just mine for themselves?
Of course that is a slight oversimplification, but there is a whole lot of truth. The business of selling mining hardware is simply so reliant on timing that there is a huge incentive for businesses to lie about time tables in order to get preorders. If they actually had enough capital to not need preorders then they would just mine for themselves.

It's easy to assume you are on the offensive when you start your rant by stating that bitcoin is a "scam". It's quite a sneaky scam then since the code is completely open.
@_date: 2014-02-25 02:19:23
Also, last year specialized hardware started appearing in the market, known as ASICs (application specific integrated circuit). These custom chips are the only way to mine profitably as they are orders of magnitude more efficient than mining with personal computers. The result has been an arms race of increasingly more powerful hardware. The issue is companies producing these chips time and again have had delays of months since they have to minimize their time to market aggressively. So the only way to mine profitably, especially in BTC denominated profits, is to preorder hardware and gamble that you get your hardware before it is obsolete. I do think that things will get a bit less crazy once mining hardware efficiency starts to plateau, though things will always be in flux when you include price variation, the other factor of the mining profitability equation.

There are many ways to look at the issue of deflation. Unless bitcoin becomes the only currency in the world what is the issue with them increasing in value due to increasing demand?
Your second point shows a misunderstanding of how bitcoin operates. Check out the bitcoin wiki for how everything works. It will take a while to absorb all the information. The fact is that very smart people have been developing and hardening the code bitcoin code for many years. There have been some concerns over DoS attacks and there is certainly work being done to improve the networks resiliency.
Mining will always operate at an equilibrium so that lower block rewards will indeed result in lower hashrate (assuming same fees and USD value). This will not be an issue until far in to the future when ideally the protocol will have been developed in a way to correctly assign a price to bitcoin txns.
@_date: 2014-02-08 19:30:11
Basically, any sane system of safely storing bitcoin has one key ingredient: unencrypted private keys should never touch a system that is connected, will be connected, and if you're a bit more paranoid has never connected to the internet.

* Tx fee savings can be passed to the consumer.
* Privacy
* Decentralized nature
* Push payments not pull
* Ability to operate without trust
* Non reversible payments
* Deflationary currency
* Long transaction times can be worked around in a variety of ways. Bitcoin the payment network is much better suited for today's world than credit card technology designed 50 years ago.
Of course some of these points are irrelevant or even downsides in the eyes of some. The fact is that there is a demand for many of these features and the invention of bitcoin has the potential to tap this market. Some people want to operate in a transparent system where the cost of fraud and charge backs are not rolled into the price of goods.

Anonymity is a tricky thing. There is a continuum of what is considered anonymous from preventing your SO from knowing what gift you bought her to preventing the NSA from busting your million dollar drug empire.

Yes, but with or without malleability the sender should include some of the same inputs as to make it a double spend. If the sender so brain dead as to send a new transaction with completely different inputs then malleability should be the least of his concerns.

Yes, I agree that they can make money off the spread. But let's talk numbers. The spread on coinbase right now is ~$1 (depending on volume). At $400 per bitcoin this represents a 0.25% fee to the consumer. People often talk about this spread like some devious source of hidden profit. *It's 0.25%*! Most of it is not even profit for coinbase, it's just the reality of the underlying market, in this case bitstamp.
Even when you include the fees involved when you go from fiat to btc and then make a payment to a merchant that goes back to fiat, bitcoin still performs quite admirably compared to credit card fees. In most cases, depending on a variety of factors I would expect credit card fees (plus the cost of fraud inherent in such a broken system) to to be higher than the convoluted fiat-&gt;btc-&gt;fiat-&gt;btc.
Of course bitcoin it's not all rosy for bitcoin at the moment. Much of the infrastructure is not ready for prime time, but it's telling that even at this stage it can work so well.
@_date: 2014-07-06 01:27:20
"very small" is relative. If I am buying say hundreds of dollars worth of online goods from a merchant that I trust, the money lost to fees is very tangible. The consumer protections that legacy payment providers offer can and will exist in the bitcoin payments space. What bitcoin can provide over those systems is again *choice*, as well as many other advantages such as fast and border-less transactions, un-freezable accounts, etc.

You can create n number of pieces of the information needed to recreate your wallet. M number of those pieces are needed to recreate it. So you can have a 2-of-3 backup for example.
M-of-n backups should be the only answer in this thread really. And because armory uses deterministic wallets, you can generate an infinite number of addresses that will be covered by the unchanging backup.

A scenario in which the only currency in use is a deflationary one is very interesting to look at. There is a lot of disagreement on whether or not it would work, personally I believe it would work, but it would mean a vastly different society than the one we have now.
Ok I can try, sorry if I was dismissive :). When you send a transaction to the network, each node that receives it verifies that the transaction is valid (properly formatted, signed, balance available, etc.) and not an attempt to double spend. If the transaction does not pass these validity tests then the node does not forward it so the transaction does not spread across the network. This is why performing 0-conf double spends in not trivial. The attacker has to get his malicious double spend transaction to a large percentage of the network very quickly before the original transaction takes root in the network. Check out the [double spending]( article on the bitcoin wiki.
A more real and present denial of service attack has been discussed that would affect thin clients like Electrum that use Simple Payment Verification (SPV) as discussed in the white paper. For some heated discussion among devs on that issue check out [this pull request](
Yeah creating a proper pricing system for fees is a hard task and there are a lot of conflicting interests. The biggest issue right now, IMO, is that because the fees are not correctly priced, miners have an incentive to mine empty blocks since smaller blocks are less likely to be orphaned. 
@_date: 2014-02-06 17:15:13
"Oh no my bitcoins keep increasing in value so I would be a fool to buy this loaf of bread. I think I will just starve instead."
This is what the argument boils down to. Yes increasing value does provide an incentive to save, but it will never eliminate spending; an equilibrium will always be reached. Why do people buy computers or phones if they will be cheaper next year?
@_date: 2014-02-04 09:48:42
Absolutely. Bitcoin will continue to dominate the cryptocurrency space for the foreseeable future since it has taken years to build the trust necessary to reach its current valuation.
Right now consensus is arrived at rather informally through discussion on the bitcoin development mailing list and the development section of the bitcointalk forums. It should be said that there is also a nonpublic mailing list for security sensitive issues that only some devs are a part of. Gavin, the lead developer, does have a large say in deciding controversial issues.  At least so far I think he has been outstanding at taking into consideration all sides when it comes to tricky subjects like the block size limit. Ultimately he does wield a lot of power, but any attempt to use his power in a nefarious way would not only work against his own interests, but he would not be able to cause any long term harm.

The future of bitcoin payments is definitely bluetooth and if you read the development mailing list there are already people working on it. The key point is that yes, QR codes are convenient for displaying bitcoin addresses, but using bitcoin addresses directly is archaic and is being slowly phased out. The payment protocol, stealth addresses, etc are the future and the information necessary for payments is too much for QR codes. There are some tricky issues involving security and MIM attacks that have to be resolved first, but bitcoin will take a giant step forward when bitcoin beginners can use bitcoin without being aware of individual bitcoin addresses.
@_date: 2014-02-04 09:08:50
In short, yes. Of course in practice bitcoin is an open source project with hundreds if not thousands of individuals keeping an eye on its development. New releases of the client come out very slowly due to the need for extensive testing and often (heated) discussion required to make changes.

For me safety is only possible in a completely offline environment. This means storing your coins in either a paper wallet or in a permanently offline device using armory or electrum.

I agree that consumer protection needs to be added on top of bitcoin for it to appeal to larger amount of people.

NO. This might be the millionth time I make this point on reddit... Credit card fraud can be rolled back in favor of the consumer. Great! You didn't even have to pay for this protection.... or did you?
**There is no such thing as a free lunch**. The cost of fraud is rolled into credit card fees which in turn gets rolled into the price of goods even when paying with cash. Bitcoin gives consumers *choice*. I trust netflix. I don't want to pay an intermediary to protect me from fraud when I am using secure tech like bitcoin and not 1950s credit card tech.
Consumer protection will be a service offered by competing companies in the bitcoin space. Competition will make the service low cost, but most importantly, *optional*.

The two best (only?) clients that allow easy spending of funds in cold storage wallets are armory and electrum. Armory has a lot of fancy features that are nice for power users, but it is much slower than electrum and requires the entire blockchain to be downloaded. Electrum is definitely going to be easier to learn and use and it is just as secure.
EDIT: I missed the "paper" part of your post.. In any case, using a permanently offline computer for cold storage is simply a no brainer if you have enough money in BTC.

The most convenient software that implements cold storage wallets are armory and electrum. I highly recommend them though armory is more resource intensive and offers some more advanced features.

The advantage of a centralized tipping service is off-chain transactions. The current txn fee on the bitcoin network is 100 bits. Using the block chain directly is great for many things, but it will never be great at micro transactions.

Even for non-basic needs all you can do is defer your spending. There will always be a balance. Will a person buy only food and shelter and nothing else if their currency gains 5% every gear guaranteed? No way. Sure, the higher the gains the bigger the incentive to save, but saving is only deferred spending. Eventually the savings will be spent once a product is available that the consumer deems worthy of purchasing.
Edit: Outside of these theoretical scenarios where bitcoin is the only currency, the fact is that it exists alongside government fiat. Since it is still so early, no one exists in a purely bitcoin economy yet. Bitcoin is a highly speculative asset and though its rapid increase in value has motivated me to save more of my income in bitcoin, it would be foolish for someone to put in their entire life savings in bitcoin meaning there is a limit to how much one can save before being too invested in bitcoin. I imagine that by the time the time the bitcoin economy is developed enough for me to feel comfortable going 100% bitcoin it will be at a level close to saturation, meaning much smaller gains than the current bootstrapping phase of development.

While address reuse has some nice properties that might lead people to do that, the practice should be avoided as much as possible. It's bad for the privacy of both parties and all of the "advantages" can be replicated with more robust solutions: stealth addresses, deterministic wallets, etc.
Bitcoin is designed to avoid address reuse and if current development efforts continue, soon enough there will be no good reason to do so.
@_date: 2014-05-11 17:39:38
Yes, I agree that chargebacks do not pose a big problem for a platform like steam. However, everyone who uses credit cards pays for the fraud/fraud protection in the form of higher fees, even if they don't want or need the protections. This is why bitcoin is a brilliant platform to build upon. You can use bitcoin directly and drive fees to near-zero or you can use third party services for very low fees to provide cryptographically-backed escrow.
Credit card fraud[1] costs the global economy Billions of dollars. Credit cards have a *terrible* design from a security perspective in that you have to give all the details of your account every time you make a payment.
Services built on top of the bitcoin network can provide much better security *and* cost much less for the merchant and the consumer.

Credit cards only appear instant. As a merchant you have be worried about losing money due to chargebacks and fraud. These losses can absolutely ravage a businesses bottom line. Credit card fees are about 3% for merchants and fraud amounts to another 3%. It's easy to see how bitcoin has a huge advantage over credit card transactions, even if you include the fees associated with converting BTC to USD and vice versa. Bitcoin allows for payments with low fees, near instant propagation, no issue going accross borders, no chargebacks, and no central clearinghouse. There is simply no other currency/payment method/technology out there that can do all of these things.
As for the issue of transactions taking 10 minutes to be confirmed, there are a variety of ways to get around it. For one, using green addresses means you can be sure the transaction is not a double spend even with zero confirmations.
The scalability problems that you mention seem alarming at first, but if you spent the time to read Satoshi's white paper and other writings from the devs you would see that all these scalibility issues were carefully considered and the protocol was designed to allow for massive growth over the years.
I absolutely agree that the volatility inherent in bitcoin is a huge problem for widespread adoption. The important thing to understand is that the whole point of having limited supply, which is the source of volatility, is to have a currency with no central bank. Sure it's a good property for a currency to be stable in order to enable trade, but the only way to keep a currency stable is through a central bank.
The road to widespread bitcoin adoption will be long and arduous, it could very well fail completely, but I just think the advantages it offers are unprecedented.

The risk of chargebacks when using ACH is very real. I would be shocked if there was no verification, similar to coinbase, for ACH deposits.
@_date: 2013-05-24 19:57:26
Exactly. Speculating on BTC stocks exposes you to much more risk than the risk inherent in holding BTC itself.

Regarding the prospect of extending the divisibility of bitcoin, it's really a non-issue since mining will be driven by transaction fees long before we reach that point.

They do not avoid charge back fraud. It just eats into their profits, which is why bitcoin is such a good choice for merchants. Check out the [wikipedia article for credit card fraud]( it's a huge problem worth billions of dollars.

The goal is that miners will be incentivized by transaction fees. The block reward is only meant as a subsidy in order to promote mining while the network is still in early stages of growth.

Cold storage using the [Armory client]( I would say any other choice when storing 250 BTC is insane, especially something like carbonwallet.

If you are in the US I would suggest you start with coinbase. There will be some verification involved, but after that it is really easy to buy bitcoins whenever you want. Coinbase also provides its users with a web wallet service which you can use until you become more familiar with the security concerns involved in hosting your own wallet.
@_date: 2013-04-15 21:40:44
Be aware that the one time I received this message I also received one the next day saying they had manually reviewed the transaction and pushed it through.

There is absolutely zero evidence that Coinbase takes advantage of their customers this way. It's important to realize the huge risk Coinbase are exposed to when selling bitcoin for reversible payment methods such as ACH transactions. Because of this risk they have an automated system that tries to identify transactions that are high risk. This system will inevitably yield false positives, but the system is automated and has nothing to do with price movements.
Personally, I've bought from Coinbase on many different occasions and only once was my transaction canceled. I got an email the next day saying they had reviewed my transactions and processed it at the original price. If they don't send you such an email feel free to email them. Please stop spreading misinformation.

Moreover, all of these websites that are based purely on chance, such as satoshi dice, don't add **any** value to the economy. Spending money on these websites is equivalent to slowly throwing your bitcoin away. Of course variance means that some people will be tricked into thinking they can make money

If you have a spare laptop, there is no better choice than having an offline [Armory]( wallet. You get rock solid security with the convenience of being able to spend the BTC in cold storage with relative ease. There are some folks that have patched versions of Armory to work with raspberry pis, but I have not tried them out myself.

No one can make changes to the existing block chain. Someone who controls a majority of the network can decide what transactions are included in *future* blocks.

If you are in the US then I highly recommend CampBX. Getting your money in and out is going to be much easier and cheaper than BTC-E and Bitstamp.
I've been using CampBX out of principle since MtGox has such a high share of the exchange volume and have had nothing but positive experiences trading there. You can get a 10% lifetime discount on trading fees by using a [referral link]( (Full disclosure: that is my referral link).

The difficulty of solving a block per hash attempt is fixed for a given difficulty. A better machine for mining will be able to generate many more hashes per second, but each hash is equivalent. Therefore the value of each hash can be easily calculated based on the current difficulty and block reward.
Pool operators tell the member of the pool to solve for the next block, but at a reduced difficulty than the real one. The reduced difficulty is employed so that these easier blocks can be produced at a reasonable rate (that is, much faster than the centuries it would take on a PC). The clever part is that these easier blocks also have a chance of being valid blocks of the real difficulty so that solving the easier blocks will eventually produce a valid block. This allows the pool operator to pay out based on the amount of work that each miner is contributing towards solving the next block.

Exchanges charge a small fee for each trade, meaning they make more money as volume increases.

Sure, mining will eventually be in the hands of a small minority of Bitcoin users. Luckily it doesn't matter whatsoever, as long as no one entity controls a significant portion of the total hashing power (and there are several economic incentives that make attacks on the network counterproductive). The difficulty of mining will have no impact to Bitcoin users beyond the advantage of a more secure network.

Blockchain transactions are how bitcoin operates, ie sending coins from some address to another. When it comes to the buying and selling bitcoin in exchange markets a third party is needed. Exchanges like mtgox, bitstamp, and btc-e provide a platform that lets buyers and sellers set their price and trade using their fiat balance at the particular exchange. In lieu of an online exchange you can simply meet up with someone in meatspace and exchange bitcoins which is what was meant by person to person.

A bitcoin based intrade would be absolutely amazing.
@_date: 2013-05-06 16:00:03
It has no direct effect on the exchange rate. The rate at which bitcoins are mined is fixed regardless of the power of the network. A stronger network does make attacks on the network more expensive to carry out, meaning increased confidence in the security of the network. I do not think, however, that this increased security will influence the price very much.

Note that a wallet is simply a collection of key pairs (public and private, public key being the address). Let's just say that the address space is large enough that the heat death of the universe will occur before you make the tiniest dent in the space using all the computing hardware on the planet.

Bitcoin operates as a p2p network in which the bitcoinqt client operates as a node. The client simply asks other nodes for the blockchain and accepts the longest chain as the correct one. The longest chain is chosen because it required the most work to generate the correct hashes (proof of work) for each block in the chain. No node can try to trick you with a malicious chain because to do so it would have to do more work than the rest of the network combined.

People around here, including myself, have been repeating: do NOT invest more than you are willing to lose. I bought bitcoin knowing it would be a wild ride. Anyone panicking right now did not know what they were getting into.
