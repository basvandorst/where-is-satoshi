That's for spiders not bitcoin

Wouldn't the first one only be a problem if an overwhelming amount of people only hoarded? Otherwise, people would just keep using their bitcoins and affecting the value of hoarders.
51% is surely there.
And the last one is definitely true (obsoletion) and lack of presence/accessibility

You will want tags that say hired, hiring, etc on posts otherwise it just looks like an ugly craigslist imo

What are LET's / time coin?
@_date: 2013-04-08 17:37:36
I didn't manage to see it at 172 too bad for me I guess
@_date: 2013-04-08 16:47:59
I can't, DDOS op mtgox needs more tenacity
@_date: 2013-04-08 16:48:40
srsly I've been button mashing since saturday

I'm not sure if the second would even crash the market at this point. It would "hurt" it, but I don't think it would be murderous. Maybe I'm wrong
@_date: 2013-04-08 08:30:39
I will however need to be verified to withdraw funds? Or?
@_date: 2013-04-08 19:12:59
Do you think bitcoin could live solely as a black market currency? It sounds odd but there will always be a financial underworld so to speak, and bitcoin seems perfect for it doesn't it?

How does authentication of you and your wallet work? There is a universal ledger where all addresses and transactions are visible. When you log onto the network with your wallet, how exactly does the authentication work? How does the network know you are...you? Will this be clear as soon as I start using it? Additionally, let's say I start with the quick wallet thing. How would I transition from that to a full node?
@_date: 2013-04-08 16:18:10
I feel like the answers on the last two are somewhat ominous. If so many people are purchasing speculating on future value and everything, how will that affect the market? Also there's the question of what is the demographic spread of everyone in the market, who holds how much, and reddit is most likely mainly made up of more technologically capable and faithful individuals in terms of demographic...
@_date: 2013-04-13 00:32:26
That's ambitious (and ominous) as hell. I really hope not.
@_date: 2013-04-10 16:08:17
You're in the minority for that. It's just weird to get accustomed to unless you're in a discipline that already believes in that.
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:55:45
Very..very happy
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:26:03
Last I checked it was at 140
@_date: 2013-04-12 23:16:04
I'm scared to know how much it'll cost...
@_date: 2013-04-08 19:11:38
Additional thought: It's kind of terrifying knowing that someone with that much money can harm so many people financially so easily
@_date: 2013-04-08 20:05:03
I suppose the big question then is when the crash is at...the price just moves so wildly so it's just so hard to discern
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:53:30
100 not crashy enough for you? I wish I had the fiat ready there
@_date: 2013-04-05 19:24:14
Isn't there a way to expedite the full client setup by downloading a partial blockchain? or was I misled?
@_date: 2013-04-08 16:04:11
I've been trying to all-in since friday, because I was confident there would be a great spike today. Should've just bought them in person with boa or something (apparently), but idiot me was all use coinbase omgomgomg...
@_date: 2013-04-10 15:59:40
better nerf btc, bench usd, tons of money, scumbag usd
did I miss any?

I'm going to go out on a limb and say there will be another correction first before a reinflation. I'm also typing this out here to another soul so I'm committed to what I believe instead of doing mental flip flops in my own head.
@_date: 2013-04-08 19:11:01
Talking about being bought out though, do you think people would really sell the whole market to them? Wouldn't their sudden interest spike the price heavily, and people scared of a 51% would just not sell?
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:40:07
And you're right, and it's back up
@_date: 2013-04-08 19:12:03
Not sure how to interpret this from a guy named bubble
@_date: 2013-04-05 19:14:46
Could you give me a short list of related things to look up?
@_date: 2013-04-10 16:35:20
Makes me think of capsule houses from dbz...
@_date: 2013-04-12 23:25:49
Dude..I didn't even get to see when it was 55. I wanted to buy at that level :(
@_date: 2013-04-08 08:30:21
I don't have a BoA accy, does that matter?
@_date: 2013-04-07 18:18:21
Hey there. I've been trying to buy in ASAP but I keep hitting walls. MTGox needs big verification and coinbase isn't taking orders. Suggestions? I'm in the US
@_date: 2013-03-25 19:07:22
How exactly would they prevent that though? It doesn't seem enforceable.
@_date: 2013-04-09 17:51:31
If we come to a point where people are no longer waiting to eagerly buy in and people begin trying to spend...that might be troublesome
@_date: 2013-03-25 20:48:11
Bitcoin would still survive as an underground currency though wouldn't it? Though it probably(?) wouldn't flourish though
@_date: 2013-04-05 03:31:54
I'm coming back in two months to laugh at whichever one of you is wrong!
@_date: 2013-04-05 20:05:45
Hey would it be a good idea to keep my bitcoin client running inside a VM? Also what happens if the computer with the wallet dies? Is it all gone if I didn't back it up?
@_date: 2013-04-05 20:24:25
I should store my wallet without the key right? Let's say the wallet gets jacked, it's useless without a key?
@_date: 2013-04-08 16:24:04
Can't tell which way comment is going
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:04:05
Wouldn't bringing that to light affect those that don't check the prices are regularly as, well, we do?
@_date: 2013-04-09 18:10:17
I think at this point...a panic drop would just cue people to buy it right back up.
@_date: 2013-04-09 17:52:26
Be that as it may, those people may not all simultaneously cash out during a panic. If their resolve is stronger than that, they'll keep the price up right?
@_date: 2013-04-08 15:56:26
I can vouch for the freezing idea (somewhat), he's not the only advocate of it and I've heard anecdotes of success
@_date: 2013-04-10 16:18:21
I don't get it, what are we seeing at the link?
@_date: 2013-04-08 16:49:48
Thank you for this. I find it kind of weird that the early adopters would lose their faith so strongly, since there is usually a stronger...understanding for early adopters.
@_date: 2013-04-05 19:38:31
What are the implications of creating a new address after every transaction? Do I request a new one and then transfer the funds...?
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:58:58
I think this is a ...larger dip
@_date: 2013-04-08 17:31:35
I would just be wary because when (not really if imo) faith in money goes back up, shiny yellow stuff value goes down for a while again
@_date: 2013-04-10 16:15:33
I know the US is in the minority. I meant that in the US, preferring metric seems to be the minority.
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:17:26


Is exactly what I'm getting at
