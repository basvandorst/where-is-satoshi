You don't even need to send them at the same time: the chance of a doublespend being successful is nearly as high even if you wait a minute or two. Equally, you don't need a "very high" fee transaction: a transaction at the high end of the normal fee range is fine, which means doublespending is cheap to do.
@_date: 2016-08-08 23:21:46
Not every effort: most scalability improvements also help privacy, simply because the poor privacy inherently comes from the poor scalability of telling the entire world about every transaction.

I agree 100%
The last thing we want is for the public to see Bitcoin as similar to systems like Alipay and PayPal where transactions can be reversed; responsibility for securing funds from attack rests in the hands of the exchanges holding them, not miners. edit: ...and to be clear, like made clear, the idea won't work unless miners collude to actively 51% attack the Bitcoin system.
edit: Keep in mind, that in this theoretical game theory situation, the attacker doesn't need an expensive, disruptive, reorg that calls into question the value of Bitcoin. They just need to pay some high fee transactions to miners, to encourage them to keep mining the existing chain - something they'll do anyway.
Sorry, but these coins are gone.

You don't need certainty to make a scam successful. Even just a 10% chance of a doublespend succeeding is enough to make a profit in many cases (e.g. currency conversions with low fees).

The idea that the Bitcoin Core team isn't prioritizing scaling is simply stupid and wrong. They're working flat out on scaling - with most of the work going towards on-chain scaling - but they're not willing to sacrifice safety to do it.
@_date: 2016-08-03 08:34:57
Because the bribe - if paid with transaction fees - is only worth something if the blocks end up in the main chain.
If Bitfinex is just making the promise to pay, that's another matter, but that can't be done without a bunch of coordinating with the existing p2p network - exactly what I said above. This is one reason why the existence of hash power rental services is dangerous.
On ethereum however, this all would be much easier to pull off technically...

This is why I've advised multiple projects like Mastercoin to not use human readable names at the protocol level: it's too easy for name squatters to scam people.

Nope: smaller miners have a harder time making money from the bribe, as they need to find multiple blocks in a row - rather unlikely. You need coordination for this to happen, which is hard for truly decentralized miners who aren't colluding.

We're now getting people to ACK specific commit IDs, which is a big help; PGP would be even better but without dedicated software to do it it'll never be convenient enough.
I often do pull-req pull-reqs! E.g. if I think some small changes to a pull need to be made, I'll make a pull-req to the devs repo, and then if they merge those changes it'll automatically show up in the original pull-req.

I don't think you realise how ridiculous your response looks in the context of what I said, and the article itself.
Implementation complexity is definitely an important consideration for algorithms that everyone in the ecosystem will have to implement; the improvements a different CRC over a one in four billion chance of a false positive are completely meaningless in comparison.
What may be an improvement is the ability to correct mistakes - which neither the article, the OP, or yourself bring up  - but that's something you should have brought up in your reply, rather than dismissively and incorrwctly saying I'm arguing that we should "never improve anything ever"
Incidentally, I've been putting some thought into this problem myself for some work I'm doing for a client, and currently am learning towards the same zbase32 encoding that Russel is suggesting, but probably sticking with a SHA256 checksum; I'm not convinced that transcription error correction is worth it given both the technical, and more importantly, UI complexity (it's possible for error correction to result in users making more mistakes rather than less, if not done very carefully).

Nodes running my full-RBF patch ensure they always have other full-RBF nodes as peers (in addition to regular nodes), so there doesn't need more than a tiny handful of full-RBF nodes for it to work well.
I know for a fact that the % of full-RBF miners is *at least* in the single digits, and potentially quite a bit higher than that. Also, even without miners running full-RBF, due to variations in mempool min-fee policy you can still pretty easily double-spend because your first transaction will have been rejected entirely.

Hopefully, although if you actually read the original ChainAnchor paper, you'll note that they appear to be also be thinking about non-Bitcoin uses of the blockchain. In that scenario potentially Bitcoin miners would be earning most of their revenue from transaction fees, which aren't necessarily derived from the value of the Bitcoin token itself.

Yes, LN along with pruning is a path to allowing that to happen, while still scaling up tx volume by a few orders of magnitude. We'd need some reasonably good mobile phones though - more likely is we stick with the current SPV, but with the reassurance that it's plausible that the community could quickly switch to something better and more secure if this gets attacked - a much, much, harder thing to do with larger blocks.
In the the longer term, we'll likely redesign how blockchains work to split up validation and thus scale Bitcoin at the blockchain level.
@_date: 2015-12-05 21:13:18
Currently it's not possible to validate any part of the Bitcoin blockchain without downloading and validating the entire thing; compensating full nodes just isn't very interesting if you still have to run one yourself.
This can and probably will change in the future as the underlying blockchain datastructure is upgraded, e.g. with something like my treechains concepts, and client-side validation, but that's still a ways off.

Here's a quick-n-dirty script to play with if you want to try it out:
For example, here's me creating a P2SH-using address with a locktime set to about a week in the future:
    ./hodl.py -v &lt;my privkey&gt; 1450719427 create
    DEBUG:root:redeemScript: 04c3387856b1752103f5f810828bcb3805ed0c28afebbaf064977195dc06aed0e2edd6d0c4378fcc01ac
    3F6ZKHjT4iGW5vimA54htkVErTpdxw6994
The verbose (-v) flag enabled debugging output, which lets me see the actual redeemScript for that address. We can use Bitcoin Core's decodescript RPC command to decode it:
    $ bitcoin-cli decodescript 04c3387856b1752103f5f810828bcb3805ed0c28afebbaf064977195dc06aed0e2edd6d0c4378fcc01ac

      "asm": "1450719427 OP_NOP2 OP_DROP 03f5f810828bcb3805ed0c28afebbaf064977195dc06aed0e2edd6d0c4378fcc01 OP_CHECKSIG",
      "type": "nonstandard",
      "p2sh": "3F6ZKHjT4iGW5vimA54htkVErTpdxw6994"
    }
OP_NOP2 is the same as OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY - to keep the CLTV pull-req as minimal and risk-free as possible I didn't change the name! An easy project for a dev new to Bitcoin Core would be to fix this.
If anyone sends any bitcoins to [3F6ZKHjT4iGW5vimA54htkVErTpdxw6994]( I'll be able to spend them after about Dec 21st 18:00 UTC with:
    ./hodl.py -v &lt;my privkey&gt; 1450719427 spend txid:n [txid:n ...] &lt;my-address&gt;

Ah, maybe you misunderstood me: Tor is blocked by the GFW. What I did with the ssh tunnel was evade the block, but that's just temporary. That particular ssh server did get blocked an hour or two later because I was using it for large-volume downloads - the GFW automatically blocks encrypted traffic that it doesn't recognize after awhile. However, another ssh server I'm using right now has been ok, because I'm not doing large volume downloads on it as the GFW hasn't flagged it yet.
t;dr: Requiring higher bandwidth connections makes evading the GFW much harder; lower-bandwidth needs are much easier to get past it.
@_date: 2015-12-05 22:23:34
Ah, you misunderstand me there. I mean, from a security point of view there might as well not be a network of validating nodes - a good security assumption is that malicious miners are trying to sybil attack you, and all the nodes you're connected too are run by those miners.

The only hard part about making a fake block is the PoW itself.
Without having the entire blockchain you have no way of knowing if any of the UTXO's spent corresponded to real transactions. This may change in the future as the underlying blockchain datastructures are upgraded with new tech, but currently that's simply how Bitcoin works.
@_date: 2015-12-05 21:32:26
Currently there is no way for one node to warn another that a block is invalid, a concept that's actually in the original Satoshi whitepaper, referred to as "alerts", which Satoshi assumed SPV nodes would use to find out if the blockchain is valid. That's why SPV as implemented by bitcoinj is more accurately referred to as non-verifying SPV.
tl;dr: Nodes are completely independent of one another.

Ok, so Hearn checkpoints the first &gt;1MB block to make a new chain, while &gt;51% of hashing power keeps mining on the Bitcoin blockchain.
What happens if the hashing power decides to switch... and keep mining 1MB blocks? Do you keep checkpointing losing blocks? Do you try to add an (unenforcable) rule that you have to pad your blocks with garbage? Do you try to do silly "must mine evreything in the mempool" rules that are unenforcable, and then patch that with a Hearn/Andresen controlled live updated checkpoint to fix the inevitable forks?
Dunno about you, but I'll stick with the ~~longest-chain~~ most-work-chain consensus myself... and I'll be advising my clients to do that too.

Depends where - I was *at* one of those mines and could get a few MB/s. Certainly some are going to have shit internet, but not all. But anyway, internet at the mines themselves isn't the issue:


Yes, I know - a big % of the hashing power is running on a single Amazon EC2 zone right now... But they're putting critical infrastructure far out of their control in countries many of them can't even visit, and may very well decide to go the opposite way if anything goes wrong. (remember all the VPS hacks of Bitcoin exchanges - same problem) The west can't do anything about it if they do.
You really need to think more about adversarial scenarios and what happens when shit hits the fan.
@_date: 2015-12-05 21:03:32
There's no network in Bitcoin, just miners; the P2P network is very easy to sybil attack and adds little if any security against attackers trying to create invalid blocks.
If you're not validating yourself, you're trusting anyone with enough hashing power to make a block in a reasonable amount of time.

As I have said before, I do support XT in certain specific ways.
Threatening to fork the Bitcoin blockchain via a hard-fork protocol change without broad consensus is dangerous, and supporting such a fork is dangerous - probably even irresponsible - but the fact that forks can be created is critical to Bitcoin being decentralized. I would never support a technical change - like centralized checkpoints of recent blocks(1) - that took away that ability.
Equally, if consensus among devs can't be reached, it's certainly more productive for everyone if the devs who disagree go down that route and honestly present themselves as a separate team with different goals; this whole business of trying to reach consensus within the same team is silly given that the goals of the people involved are so different.
1) For technical reasons Bitcoin Core currently has checkpoints, but they're *never* applied to blocks recent enough to matter in practice; they're always set far enough back - a month or two - that if the checkpoints mattered due to a reorg Bitcoin would be dead anyway.
@_date: 2015-12-19 16:08:59
Yeah, I think a good safety margin to have is to make sure mining via satellite is feasible. That's in part a business question - what difference in profit between censored and uncensored miners will we accept?

For example, my treechains concept would split the blocks in the blockchain into many different shards, whose total size can scale to whatever demand is needed, making the idea of a max block size completely irrelevant.

Citation needed.
1) For example, at the Scaling Bitcoin conference you didn't bother attending, I personally was working with miners to come up with a standard to measure blocksize increases against based on orphan rates that their businesses could accept. That's precisely a quantification of decentralization safety, something you yourself never seem to be interested in doing.
2) The Bitcoin Core team has done tremendous amounts of work mitigating blocksize related risks by improving the performance of Bitcoin Core by multiple orders of magnitude. Similarly we're working on many different non-bandwidth scaling schemes, all of which mitigate blocksize related risk. Finally, my treechains/sharding research is yet another example of blocksize related risk mitigation.
What have you done to quantify safety or mitigate risk?
@_date: 2015-12-02 00:43:19
Yes, based on coin ownership.
What's wrong with users voting on BW/storage required to mine? That's a fundamental attribute in determining how decentralized mining is and how expensive it is to validate - how hard it is to participate fully in the system and its governance.

Also, when we say "small amounts" that means test it with a *wallet* that doesn't have much BTC in it. Worst case is a bug makes you lose everything in that wallet!

@_date: 2015-12-30 13:11:29
Well, strictly speaking it *doesn't* shift the balance of power, as miners already have this option. In fact this is a really old idea, usually called an "evil fork", or " evil soft fork", but people have shyed away from publicly promoting it. I've been thinking about promoting it for a few months now as a safer alternative to hard forks, but have held off - now that multiple people are reinventing it I probably should publish my take on it.

You're quite mistaken here.
RBF nodes have been running on mainnet with my [RBF fork of Bitcoin Core](  for about a year and a half now. F2Pool has been running FSS-RBF for months ago, which uses the same codebase as the opt-in Full-RBF pull-req that was recently merged. On testnet, I know someone has been specifically running full-RBF for months now, with a significant % of the hashing power. Heck, I even have full-RBF DNS seeds for both mainnet and testnet: rbf-seed.(t)btc.petertodd.org
And of course, RBF isn't a *consensus* change so the testing requirements are far less stringent.
As for BIP101, the testing that has been done on testnet has been pretty minimal - notably they haven't made enough big blocks to get a significant blockchain size or UTXO set yet. I proposed we do exactly that last summer for a proper full-load test, which Gavin refused to consider saying "it'd made testnet useless"
You know, if you can't run a full node easily, that kinda says something...

In all the examples you gave, trust is backed by the legal system, and governments.

Gavin's viewpoint is perfectly reasonable in a centralized system where as the system grows the number of people who are not trusting others to do validation for them stays constant.

The key thing is p2pool may be temporarily centralized around forrestv, but if anything happened it'd be very easy for someone else to step in and do a release under their name and rebuild the social consensus needed to upgrade the p2pool protocol.
From the point of view of an attacker trying to stop p2pool, that's fairly decentralized, and hard to stop.

We've already gathered that data by previous soft-limit increases: # of nodes decreases and mining gets more centralized.

You need roughly as many nodes as there are users.
It's not going to be an exact 1:1 relationship - realistically something like 1%-10% - but in the event of an attack you need to be able to get those who don't have a full node that they can trust up to speed with a good node quickly.
Re: miners validating - that's my whole point, relying 100% on miners always doing that is dangerous.

No, but unfortunately we don't have a cryptographically secure way of measuring the "average joe's" vote, so measuring by # of coins is the best we can do.
Similarly, it'd be better if we had a miner vote that was measured per-person rather than per-hash, but there is no known way to do that without trusting central authorities. (IE digital passport signatures)

I don't want to destroy Bitcoin in the process of scaling it up; quite possibly we won't get a second chance to bootstrap proof-of-work again.
The worst that happens if the blocksize limit isn't raised is Bitcoin growth for low-end applications with the least value per-tx is significantly held back, while growth of applications with the most value per-tx is mostly unaffected. That's a pretty damn good worst-case outcome - the phrase "Nobody eats there anymore. It's too crowded!" comes to mind. More likely IMO the fee pressure will accelerate development of solutions to the problem like the Lightning network and hub-and-spoke payments.
I think the real problem is there isn't consensus on the premise: that we must scale up Bitcoin now, as an emergency hard fork. Again, the devs above would mostly say "lets wait and continue to analyse", because none of us are worried enough about fees rising from the current 0.5cents per tx that we'll risk making major changes to Bitcoin without careful analysis.
Equally, the way so much of the community has responded to proposals for scalability technology that doesn't need a blocksize increase with accusations of bias and self-interest doesn't exactly help achieve consensus. Frankly, there's lots of people who see the incredibly acrimonious debate and fear mongering by the "increase the blocksize now" crowd and have decided to just ignore the debate and focus on getting work done.
Frankly, I think the most useful thing for reaching consensus will be for the non-increase-now crowd to do a better job on educating the public about what the risks of blocksize increases are, as well as why the blocksize limit is important to the security of Bitcoin.

Serious question: What's your budget?
I've already written that code before.
@_date: 2015-06-11 15:39:42
Yes exactly.
The full node that matters is the one you can trust because you run it yourself. That's precisely what my [tweet]( on the topic was about. Looks like the estimate was a bit high - the 350k users might have been something more like 85k users - but the actual point that a huge number of people that previously verified the blockchain themselves are now trusting miners to do so for them is correct.
Speaking of, I opened [an issue]( on the [CryptoCurrency Certification Consortium]( github about the need for the standard to require companies to run their own full nodes to verify transactions. In addition, the infrastructure they run those nodes on needs to be held to nearly the same security standards as any other critical transaction processing infrastructure. (e.g. hosting on a VPS is nearly as ill-advised as hosting your trading engine on a VPS)

I've spoken to two ATM operators with loses among other things... one of them the losses were in the thousands of dollars and the police had gotten involved.
Anyway, as I keep saying, the reality is this stuff doesn't work, yet payment providers are doing very harmful things like trying to get contracts with the majority of hashing power to get txs mined, and sybil attacking the network to measure propagation. They need to do that stuff because zeroconf doesn't work in a decentralized environment.

Like I said in my actual writeup, you can *already* double-spend that transaction with a high probability of success.

@_date: 2015-06-22 13:52:41
Shorter blocktimes significantly increase the effectiveness of a whole variety of attacks; it's not a linear relationship where you can just halve the block interval to double the overall transaction capacity. Rather for a given security level you'll get something less than double the capacity, and figuring out exactly what is that tradeoff is something people are still studying.

"a single machine acting as a full node takes approximately 10 minutes to verify and process a 32 MB block"

That I certainly agree with. I mean, hell, a almost-certainly throwaway doxxed me on the -development mailing list the other day, so.


For starters, I know for a fact that many companies business models are utterly dependent on txs being cheap and near unlimited because they can't transition to scalability tech. Annoyingly, this is often for regulatory reasons, e.g. companies that have been telling regulators that "don't worry! bitcoin isn't anonymous! all txs go on this public chain"... Scalability tech all inherently has improved privacy potential simply by keeping tx data off the public ledger, something that worries many in this space. (I spend a surprising amount of time in regulatory workshops/panels/etc. actually; right now I'm attending a conference related to regulatory issues in fact)

Zeroconf is dumb - an opinion shared by a lot of Bitcoin devs - and it's going to get even dumber in the future. In particular, larger blocksizes make propagation less reliable, making zeroconf more dangerous to rely on.
RBF isn't strongly related yo the blocksize debate; regardless of the blocksize RBF is useful.
@_date: 2015-06-30 15:37:42

Heck, can you point to some explicit quotes or articles from me where I'm been vocally against? Maybe some recent interviews?
Like I say, it's really fascinating to me how there's this strawman idea that I'm everywhere vocally opposing changes to the blocksize, and that my *one* voice in this issue actually has that disproportionate an effect.
@_date: 2015-06-22 14:29:22
So... buy maybe a year or two at best of growth, based on a problem we haven't actually seen yet, at the high cost of more centralization, with no plan other than "hope one or two more years solves it"?

Here's a quick-n-dirty script to play with if you want to try it out:
For example, here's me creating a P2SH-using address with a locktime set to about a week in the future:
    ./hodl.py -v &lt;my privkey&gt; 1450719427 create
    DEBUG:root:redeemScript: 04c3387856b1752103f5f810828bcb3805ed0c28afebbaf064977195dc06aed0e2edd6d0c4378fcc01ac
    3F6ZKHjT4iGW5vimA54htkVErTpdxw6994
The verbose (-v) flag enabled debugging output, which lets me see the actual redeemScript for that address. We can use Bitcoin Core's decodescript RPC command to decode it:
    $ bitcoin-cli decodescript 04c3387856b1752103f5f810828bcb3805ed0c28afebbaf064977195dc06aed0e2edd6d0c4378fcc01ac

      "type": "nonstandard",
      "p2sh": "3F6ZKHjT4iGW5vimA54htkVErTpdxw6994"

Anyway, like I say, it's *not* actually 95% adoption, it's 51% adoption. The 95% threshold in BIP34/BIP66 is something miners voluntarily do; it is not and can't be mandated because a majority can always ignore the minorities blocks.

From what I hear, China deliberately slows down connections to non-China sites, and they do so inconsistently as well. For instance, at one point I was able to successfully get Tor working over a SSH tunnel to one of my servers, and through Tor I was getting about 10MB/s on a download, yet otherwise I was getting a few hundred bytes a second - the internet BW was there, but the GF was blocking it.
We should have a blocksize small enough that miners who need to evade censorship have a fighting chance of doing so; even 1MB is probably pushing the limits for that right now.

What do you mean clogging up? They shows that - as expected - someone could flood the network with cheap transactions; at the current minimum fee it costs just $2.5 per block to fill blocks with spam transactions. Transactions that paid more than the absolute minimum fee were unaffected.


Why not do a better job explaining to people what the issues are and come to true consensus? I've never been one to cave to silly hysterical bullying - this is Bitcoin, not a schoolyard.

Incidentally, you shouldn't be at all surprised to have people change their mind for a smaller limit from a previously larger limit.
The blocksize is a *security parameter* that determines how easy it is to resist a whole variety of attacks, and as we find more attacks, the safe setting for that parameter tends to do down rather than up. Similarly, while people have done a lot of good work in improving propagation speed in the *best* case, we've had very little success in improving propagation speed when under attack.

The *only* thing stopping the type of double-spends I'm talking about is a lack of software, like a nice Android app. Instead you have to deal with command-line-tools: 
This is like saying "No-one will decrypt it! I used triple-rot13!"
@_date: 2015-06-19 12:27:22
Yeah, both full-RBF and Bitcoin XT nodes advertise themselves; full-RBF nodes preferentially peer to each other (and XT nodes) to ensure good propagation of the double-spends.
It's interesting that Bitcoin XT is actually a significant help in getting double-spends to miners, even for the miners who don't run RBF. The thing is, it's quite frequent for a tx to never reach a miner, then get double-spent by a second tx propagated by XT/RBF nodes. Been seeing a lot of that w/ tx's that pay no fees for instance.

In this case it's potentially quite dangerous, as we have a direct trade-off between DoS-resistance goals and zeroconf goals in many situations; we've seen this argument before used to shout down new features, as well as attack protections. (e.g. don't prevent X type of ill-formed-tx that should be non-standard from entering the mempool w/o a soft-fork like miner vote to achieve "consensus")

If we don't have enough technical margin to make 2MB reasonably safe, we're in a pretty dangerous position already... So 2MB is hopefully alright, and it'd give the industry a bit more time to move to genuine scaling solutions.
But part of such a solution should be a broad consensus from the rest of the industry that this is a temporary bridge to better solutions.

We already have &gt; 1 block confirmations all the time; we're basically running at capacity and always are. People don't realize this because low-value Bitcoin tx uses get moved off-chain, e.g. changetip, and tx volume ebbs and flows because block creation is a random poisson process.
Anyway, I thought that Tradeblock analysis was very odd, trying to analyse fees as a black box without (apparently) ever looking at the actual sourcecode.
@_date: 2015-06-19 10:58:27


efficiently, with up to 90%+ transaction size savings possible in some
transaction patterns. (e.g. long payment chains⁶) More users in less
blockchain space will lead to higher overall fees per block.
This will increase the value of Bitcoin. Shouldn't miners join F2Pool because of this? :)
Anyway, the top section of the paper is the most important regarding that objection: if even the most popular wallets for "end-users" don't detect double-spends *at all* let alone invalid transactions, and can be double-spent trivially with ~50% probability, what does that say about how much people are actually relying on zeroconf?
Equally, where big payment providers are going with zeroconf - looking into getting contracts with all the major pools to force their transactions though - is a pretty ugly future with big issues.
It's all tradeoffs, and I'm happy to ditch something that never actually worked - zeroconf - in exchange for useful features and decentralization protections.

You know, an interesting consideration is that if Gavin did that, he (and Mike) could be seen as being in control of a money-transfer system, an activity that is heavily regulated; one of the (many) reasons why the Bitcoin Core development process is so heavy on consensus building and broad analysis of issues is because we want to clearly show to regulators and others that no single developer is in control of the Bitcoin system.
In any case, it'd be a real nuisance and waste a lot of people's time changing git URLs and what not, not to mention highly misleading to users, (Gavin hasn't been lead dev for over a year) but ultimately it is just changing a key-value pair in a centralized registry.

Like I said, there was a quick burst of txs in a few minutes above the normal background rate.
From what I can see right now they're doing the smart thing, a slow but consistent attack that gradually builds the size of the mempool. Getting tx flood attacks to actually propagate across the network is tricky; looks like they're doing this one correctly.

I recently did a technical review of Ripple for [R3]( and presented it to about a dozen major banks. One of my findings in that technical review was that the global consensus blockchain that Ripple uses (the Ripple Labs software, not the original Ripple proposal) has the same scalability problem that Bitcoin has.
I think it's very notable that even large banks considered this a serious issue that raised questions about how appropriate the Ripple technology was for their needs; even banks with IT budgets in the tens of millions of dollars don't want to have to process all the worlds transactions in a single ledger.

"as cyber attacks" - you're missing my point.
You're creating a situation where what should be a *temporary* cartel can *permanently* give themselves a major advantage, without making it all that obvious. You're removing multiple safety protections, leaving us a very fragile design. And yet you've done no engineering analysis on the outcome.
@_date: 2015-06-07 15:28:06
That's basically true, and the idea was you'd make that possible by moving validation client-side. You could think of it as miners simply writing down what happened on a giant ledger, without validating that the rules were being followed. Checking the rules to determine if coins are valid or invalid becomes the client's problem.
With simple math techniques the data required to prove that is large but grows linearly; with much more advanced "moon math" it may be possible to get that data down to a few KB.

The discussion re: 8MB vs. 20Mb is with regard the *risk* of that happening - if other miners were producing 20MB blocks there are many scenarios where the Chinese pools would be at a severe disadvantage.
Anyway, given the huge growth potential of Bitcoin and blockchain tech, if 20MB is the max limit there is a high chance we'll be seeing 20MB blocks soon; if the limit was 100MB there is a high chance we'd be seeing 100MB blocks.

Nope, the Chinese miners don't have to even SPV mine: bandwidth *within* China is pretty good. The only problem is bandwidth out of China, which has to pass through the horribly slow Great Firewall. (I spent a week in China recently - the GFW sucks and is deliberately slow)
We could easily be in a position where western miners are forced to use servers within China to host their pools, putting block selection under Chinese government political control should the Chinese government choose to.

Doesn't even need a miner - RBF is still useful in cases where your first tx wasn't accepted at all by miners, e.g. because the fee was too low to even get in, or there was no fee at all. This isn't uncommon and you see double-spends all the time on the network getting such transactions unstuck.
Dunno who the heck is making them - presumably some custom wallet software - but they're out there.

Nope, those software engineering issues were resolved and opt-in RBF will replace txs with unconfirmed children.

Do you realize how much the response to GHash reaching 51% spooked GHash themselves? They invited myself, Jeff Garzik, and a bunch of other representatives from the mining, investment, banking, VC, and payments sides of the Bitcoin ecosystem to an emergency meeting to figure out what to do about it. A common thread among the investors/VC's there is that GHash reaching 51% seriously called into question the value of the Bitcoin ecosystem, and that GHash should be taking this seriously as they're shooting themselves in the foot. The outcome of that meeting was a vague plan to limit the size of the GHash pool, which I suspect they actually implemented by pointing their hashing power to other pools to cover up their total hashing power - although I have no way of knowing. Far from an ideal response, but a lot better than the outcome would have been if there had been no community outcry at all.

I'm about to go to bed, but anyway, skimming through that makes me think you don't understand quote how priority works, and in any case, a lot of hashing power ignores priority.
As for outspending, you basically need to fill whatever amount of blocksize space is left at whatever fee level. I can guarantee you this will get expensive very fast! Best to set your sights low, e.g., at slightly higher than the minimum relay fee at first.
@_date: 2015-06-08 22:51:23


They don't show that; blockchain space is allocated via a supply and demand auction. All those tests did is delay txs paying the lowest fees.
This isn't ideal of course, but it's easy for wallets to fix this by both estimating fees rather than using fixed fees, and letting users increase fees after the fact. (e.g w/ Luke-Jr's child-pays-for-parent patch and/or my replace-by-fee patch)

A soft fork simply means that the block is valid under the old rules; its quite possible for a softfork to make it impossible for non-upgraded miners to produce valid blocks. In fact, that's how we've usually implemented soft-forks.
@_date: 2015-12-01 15:41:50


Please keep this debate professional.


First of all, you can't start building a block until you receive other miners' blocks, which means that if those other miners broadcast large blocks that you can't get sufficiently fast, you're wasting your hashing power doing nothing useful. This is a well known variant of the selfish mining attack, although possibly more dangerous, since it's one that happens naturally even without any malice. Pieter Wuille's simulation does show this effect, as have other simulations, and my mathematical analysis of [perverse propagation incentives](
You're simulation did not show that effect because it effectively simulated a situation where the "small" miners had significantly more bandwidth than the "large" miners - as you acknowledged to me in person at Scaling Bitcoin Montreal, your simulation doesn't accurately simulate bandwidth and uses an extremely simplified latency model that doesn't appear to model any real-world scenario. I'll note that I asked you to publicly correct your erroneous results, which you have not done.
Secondly, it's unacceptable for small miners to be unable to produce blocks with as many transactions as large miners, both because transaction fees are non-trivial, and because it creates social pressure on them to move their hashing power to larger pools.

voipcheap is the usual case where if a double-spend is detected you just cancel the order and shutdown the account. Similarly if destinia works like cheapair it doesn't actually buy the tickets until the first confirmation - again no zeroconf problem.

Well, my post above is meant to represent a relatively safe hard-fork scenario where there is broad consensus that the hard-fork should happen. Obviously situations with less broad consensus are possible, albeit with much higher risks. For instance, if just 60% of miners were on board rather than 90%, you have much higher risks of reorgs leading to double-spends.
@_date: 2015-06-13 23:39:48

Remember that users of SPV wallets and hosted wallets will play no part in a blocksize hard-fork. In the case of SPV wallets, the software trusts miners 100% and verifies nothing; in the case of hosted wallets like Coinbase the user trusts the service.
To raise the blocksize for the supermajority of users here's what you would need to do, and roughly how many people/organizations you'd need to convince:
1) Get around 90% of the hashing power on board. (~12 people)
2) Setup a few dozen or so nodes on the P2P network to support larger blocks. (1 person)
3) Get at least one DNS seed used by most SPV wallets pointing to the upgraded nodes. (1 person in theory, a half-dozen at most)
4) Major payment processors (~10 people)
5) Major exchanges (~10 people)
6) Major merchants (~10 people)
7) Major API's providers (~10 people)
8) Hosted wallets - Blockchain.info, Coinbase, Circle, Coinkite, Greenaddress, etc. (~10 people)
9) Electrum servers (~10 people)
10) Darkwallet/Obelisk servers (~5 people)
Total: ~84 people to get something like 95% of the economic activity of Bitcoin to hard-fork to a bigger blocksize.
Sure, it'd be less than ideal and a bit chaotic - and I'm sure a small number of users will get double-spend by the 10% of miners who aren't on board in my above example - but this really isn't that difficult **provided that there is consensus**. In the case where a severe security hole in Bitcoin was discovered that could only be fixed with a hard-fork I'm sure we could accomplish all of the above in a few days, and most of the above in less than 24 hours.
@_date: 2015-06-26 18:33:00
It'll be a soft-fork, not a hard-fork, so it'll need 95% of the miners to upgrade; full-nodes that don't upgrade will still work, but degrade to SPV security.

FWIW Patrick Strateman is working on a patch to limit the size of the mempool by dropping low-priority transactions:
The final patch will likely also increase the minimum relay fee as needed to keep bandwidth usage reasonable. We don't do that right now, but it's not a big deal to add so long as we can shout down the "PRESERVE ZEROCONF AT ALL COSTS" crowd. (bandwidth limits and mempool size limits can be used to double-spend unconfirmed txs)
Also, F2Pool just adopted first-seen-safe replace-by-fee, which will let users resubmit their transactions with higher fees to ignore your spam.
Remember that there's no such thing as a genuine backlog - transactions are mined highest fee/kb first, so even if there are 241MB of txs in the queue at the "standard" fee, if you pay slightly higher than that you get to the front of the line and you'll get your tx mined in the next block.
edit: While we're at it, I'd recommend that pools raise the minimum relay fee so that this spam gets ignored. Either way, people paying the lowest fees aren't going to get their txs mined anytime soon; might as well not fill up the blockchain with garbage, and unnecessarily get your blocks orphaned and mempools filled up, as well as increase getblocktemplate latency.
To do this, use the -minrelaytxfee argument. They're using 0.12mBTC/KB, so anything higher than that should be fine, e.g. -minrelaytxfee=0.0002

Note that Bitcoin's checkpoints are never added to blocks more recent than a month or two old; if Bitcoin's checkpoints ever come into play because of a reorg so many blocks are reorged that Bitcoin is 100% screwed.
The reason they exist is so new clients can sync up without being at risk of DoS attacks from sybil attackers feeding them junk blocks. We're working on replacing that system and fixing those DoS attacks.

Lets be clear on this: if that competitor has 10% of the hashing power, while they're a block behind unless they find two blocks in a row - roughly a 1% probability - they're wasting their time.
A good tactic would be to pick off competitors one by one. Push their orphan rate up for a bit, watch their profitability drop like a stone, and accept their hashing power into your pool, with a suitable fee of course...

Mike Hearn's analysis is completely irrelevant to the situation: like it or not what I described is how Bitcoin *actually works* and the best we're going to do is make a small change in the cost of such attacks. As I mentioned in my post, a 8MB blocksize increase only increases the cost of this attack to $40k - still chump change.
No-one is proposing that there be no blocksize limit, and as long as we have a limit, you'll have to bid for transaction space. If anything, I expect the problem to get even more acute as more and more different classes of users start using Bitcoin for a wider variety of things, e.g. securing financial records, timestamping, etc.

Because to make it actually work they're working towards thing that are highly damaging to Bitcoin, like getting contracts with a majority of hashing power to guarantee their double-spends, sybil attacking the network, etc.
@_date: 2015-06-19 04:08:24
Keep in mind too that given the way pools have been DDoS'ed and otherwise attacked - sometimes by each other - they need to be able to avoid having publicly visible high speed nodes relaying to each other. Under attack in those scenarios the profitability will be dominated by the *average* time it takes to relay blocks across the whole network rather than the much smaller subset of nodes that can afford high bandwidth connections.
Pools being forced to peer directly with other pools to remain profitable has severe drawbacks for decentralization, as well as the overall resiliancy to coercion, of the whole Bitcoin network. Frankly, rusty's results are worrying even for 1MB blocks.

Kinda annoying how there's no technical analysis in this BIP at all. Also, there's no mechanism for *users* of Bitcoin to have a say in whether or not the fork happens - its entirely miner driven, which only allows the largest users a say. (e.g. attempts by large players to get hashing power contracts)
Strong NACK
Edit: regarding the idea that 1MB is a "relic" - you have to actually show why we can support more than 1MB; just because we want to have a bigger blocksize doesn't mean the technology actually can. I know looked into it and came to the conclusion that the tech is capable of only *less than* 1MB; I'm looking into it right now and coming up with a similar conclusion. That's the kind of technical detail I would have wanted to see in this BIP.

That is exactly what I'll tell them.
Unfortunately Bitcoin just isn't ready yet for that kind of adoption; raising the blocksize doesn't change this. I agree completely with that the fundamental design of Bitcoin is better suited to being a settlement layer for systems built on top of it; all the world's transactions on one global consensus chain just doesn't make much sense.
A decent analogy is how DNS used to be implemented with a global - and huge! - hosts file that everyone had a copy of. That just didn't scale, and was replaced by a hierarchical system that did.

I don't think it'll change it much at all.
I actually just got back from a blockchain tech conference attended mainly by "big finance" players, and of the ones interested in using Bitcoin itself no-one was talking about raising the blocksize. There's lots of use-cases around things like moving money across borders that aren't very fee sensitive at all, and equally, better ways to use blockchains can and have in the past been developed quite quickly in response to fee pressure.

FSS-RBF has significant limitations in practical use, resulting in higher costs. (30%-50% usually, 95%+ in certain situations) As I say in my [BIP]( why should the broader Bitcoin community accept those limitations given that the only big payment processors like Coinbase are able to have any success at preventing zeroconf doublespends?
Equally, those processors do that by sybil attacking the Bitcoin network, and what's worse, are willing to get into dangerous mining contracts with a majority of hashing power. This is a significant centralization risk as it is not practical or even possible for small miners to enter into these contracts, leading to a situation where moving your hashing power to a larger pool will result in higher profits from hashing power contracts; if these payment providers secure a majority of hashing power with these contracts inevitably there will be a temptation to kick non-compliant miners off the network entirely with a 51% attack.
@_date: 2015-06-08 23:33:03

Re: OP_CHECKMULTISIG, I was thinking about defining it some kind of template scheme, where you specify what bytes are just bytes, and what bytes are derived pubkeys, in a list that gets generated then hashed to form the P2SH address.
Threshold signatures are good, but they do have the issue that it's not guaranteed that you'll be able to determine which private keys created the signature; post-compromise this is a big problem for auditing. The other problem is they require a lot of communication rounds.
Also, did you get a BIP # allocation from for this? It's the one bit of actual administrative overhead in the entire system, and as a point of procedure he'll give you a different one now.

Well, yeah, it's not great that the average person is trusting others to audit the software they use that implements the Bitcoin protocol, but at least that's an inherently human endeavor that just needs to be done once per version - fairly limited in scope.
Auditing the blockchain OTOH is an ongoing 24/7 process that must be done constantly by people you trust - connecting to random nodes on the P2P network isn't sufficient as it's easy to sybil attack the network.

The stats are a little weird for this, because so many try it and give up quickly, yet some of the big companies (Coinbase, etc.) are committed to it and seem to be covering up their losses. (spoke to someone at coinbase awhile back who said they'd lost tens of thousands)

Well, keep in mind that right now tx fees are around a half-cent each - if we're clamoring to raise fees before there's even a hint of tx fee pain, that sets a precedent that the moment Lightning etc. becomes *naturally* needed, the blocksize limit will just be bumped up again with a similar "more centralized for cheaper" tradeoff.
I'm at a conference right now actually, and had this discussion with someone in the finance side of Bitcoin, who was pointing out how nearly no-one he knew outside of a few highly leveraged VC funded startups (Coinbase, etc.) sees this as an urgent issue. From the point of view of an investment firm getting into Bitcoin to move serious sums of money around, if tx fees went up by 100x they wouldn't care - that may be an extreme example, but we can get a *lot* of growth out of that, and give Lightning and similar systems a reason to actually exist. If we just take the easy way out each time they won't - hell, Coinbase isn't even fixing unconfirmed txs properly, preferring to lose large sums of money to double-spends rather than get decent systems...

From what I've seen, very few bitpay using merchants depend on zeroconf; off the top of my head I can't say I've ever run into one.
For instance, I just used bitpay to pay for a VPS the other day, and while they accepting the tx instantly, that's a case where the moment it's double-spent you just turn the server off. No big deal.
Equally, when I last bought plane tickets on cheapair - I've spent a low five figures on cheapair that way - it went through coinbase and the ticket wasn't confirmed until the first confirmation.
I mean, hell, I once did a bit of a survey of the porn/file-download sites and couldn't find any that accepted txs w/o a confirmation.

Tricky problem! A good first step that's being done right now is the creation of the stand-alone libconsensus library, that captures all the consensus-critical details of the Bitcoin protocol specification into one library that can be used by any Bitcoin node implementation.
More broadly, IMO we need to find better ways of using proof-of-work blockchains that push validation client-side, making the protocol rules themselves be an opt-in, while everyone who needs anti-doublespending/proof-of-publication capabilities for their protocols shares in the same proof-of-work security. This is the idea behind my treechains/proofchains research, although of course, it's very much a work-in-progress.
@_date: 2015-12-03 17:28:47


...yet this "kick the can down the road" solution keeps increasing the blocksize at a rapid pace until 2036, eventually ending up with 8GB blocks - nearly four orders of magnitude more than we have right now.
A genuine "buy time" solution would be something more like Pieter Wuille's BIP103, or Adam Back's 2-4-8 proposal. Gavin's is a radical change to how Bitcoin works.
@_date: 2015-06-08 22:55:00


Why do you think that's ridiculous? If anything, it's actually a conservative estimate - if we really pushed for it I wouldn't be surprised if you could deploy a blocksize increase in literally a matter of days. It'd be messy sure, but so long as there is consensus it's not a hard thing to do emergency upgrades, particularly when the majority of wallets that people use would be unaffected. (SPV or hosted)
Keep in mind that we *have* done emergency upgrades before to fix security issues. A hard-fork is more difficult, but it's still very easy to fire up a few hundred upgraded nodes for SPV wallets to use after we get miners to upgrade; w/ hosted wallets there's probably less than a dozen or two people who would need to be contacted to upgrade.

Miners can't tell which output is the change output, thus you are always forced to add an input to satisfy the FSS-RBF rule that output values must always increase or stay the same. Thus with FSS-RBF replacements are always bigger; it's full-RBF that lets you just decrease the value of the change output.

Here's a quick-n-dirty script to play with if you want to try it out:
For example, here's me creating a P2SH-using address with a locktime set to about a week in the future:
    ./hodl.py -v &lt;my privkey&gt; 1450719427 create
    DEBUG:root:redeemScript: 04c3387856b1752103f5f810828bcb3805ed0c28afebbaf064977195dc06aed0e2edd6d0c4378fcc01ac
    3F6ZKHjT4iGW5vimA54htkVErTpdxw6994
The verbose (-v) flag enabled debugging output, which lets me see the actual redeemScript for that address. We can use Bitcoin Core's decodescript RPC command to decode it:
    $ bitcoin-cli decodescript 04c3387856b1752103f5f810828bcb3805ed0c28afebbaf064977195dc06aed0e2edd6d0c4378fcc01ac

      "type": "nonstandard",
      "p2sh": "3F6ZKHjT4iGW5vimA54htkVErTpdxw6994"

OP_NOP2 is the same as OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY - to keep the CLTV pull-req as minimal and risk-free as possible I didn't change the name! An easy project for a dev new to Bitcoin Core would be to fix this.

The payment protocol need not always be 1:1 communications. Basically you're payment request can be a *general* one, saying to the sender "If you want to send me money, use this stealth address, and when you do, please use this communications channel to tell me you've done that so I get the payment". Where my proposal differ's from Mike's less sophisticated one is in that when used in that way there exists a "last ditch" backup option to make sure that if that communications channel fails it's always possible for the receiver to recover the funds sent to them.
Sorry, I know the way these terms are getting used is a bit confusing!

Correct. I first increased the allowed scriptSig size in pull-req [ allowing up to n-of-15. Gavin Andresen followed up with [ which removed the IsStandard() rules for P2SH transactions entirely* allowing stuff even more advanced than n-of-m multisig like hashlocked transactions.

Also there's this misconception out there that developers like myself and gmaxwell are against proof-of-stake: we're not, we just don't know how to make it actually work the way Peercoin wants it to work and get annoyed when people push the concept in spite of that.
Proof-of-stake is actually a fairly common topic among discussion between crypto-coin theorists, but no-one has ever figured out how to make pure PoS schemes work. You probably can use PoS in conjunction with PoW mining in *limited* ways, but there's a lot of pitfalls in such schemes, including attacks that we probably haven't even thought of yet.

Coming to consensus in a decentralized network takes time unfortunately, it's just a fundemental limitation.
You can however punish people after the fact for fraud. That's what [replace-by-fee scorched-earth]( does and it can certainly get us as good zeroconf security as the defacto zeroconf security was supposed to provide. You can also use things like fidelity bonds to back anti-double-spend promises.
But actually preventing the double-spend? That's just not possible without sacrificing some of the decentralization of Bitcoin.

No. The Counterparty checkpoints are very different than Bitcoin/alt-coin checkpoints because anyone can recompute them; they are an optimization rather than a security measure. Basically whereas in Bitcoin a checkpoint means "Regardless of what the actual blockchain is, this is the One True Blockchain, so reject re-organizations that try to change that", in Counterparty a checkpoint means "If a block has this hash, I claim that the consensus state (asset blances) are this, so if you trust me you can skip laborously re-computing all that info yourself."
It's perfectly OK if different Counterparty implementations/clients use different checkpoints, or none at all. If different Bitcoin/alt-coin clients use different checkpoints the consensus breaks the moment there is a re-organization.
Incidentally, it's been proposed that Bitcoin clients use Counterparty-style checkpoints before for the UTXO set: you'd calculate what the UTXO set should be at some blockhash, invite everyone to double-check the calculation themselves, and if everyone agrees anyone who trusts that the hash was in fact calculated correctly can skip calculating the UTXO set themselves.
edit: Actually, I should have checked the sourcecode: they *aren't* shipping Counterparty with asset balances, so the checkpoints are purely an *assertion statement* to make sure you're computer calculated everything correctly, as you can [see here](
edit2: I know people are going to ask, so why does Bitcoin Core have checkpoints? Basically because of a DoS vulnerability when you're starting up a new node, and in addition, Bitcoin Core doesn't actually check signatures prior to a checkpoint to speed things up. Fortunately it's a relatively theoretical issue, as a reorg big enough to make checkpoints matter would be at minimum a week or so long - we always set them fairly far back every release - which would *very* likely destroy all trust in Bitcoin anyway. This is completely unlike so many alt-coins that use very frequently updated checkpoints, often automatically updated, as a way to get around the fact that they're insecure due to 51% attacks.

Those remaining few are finding out the hard way that unconfirmed transactions are already highly insecure. Heck, I'm discussing the issue with two services right now. Both are moving to secure solutions, and both have lost quite a bit of money due to double-spends made possible by the fact that zeroconf just isn't safe even *without* replace-by-fee.
And ironically, with replace-by-fee you can actually make zeroconf double-spending unprofitable by using the [scorched earth]( defense, but only if at least some miners adopt replace-by-fee.

Exactly. Right now for blocks to be discouraged is a "nuclear option" that has high risks for the pools doing so, as Mike quite correctly points out in his post. By adding a voting mechanism you're making it much easier for the majority of hashing power to come to consensus about what they will block the minority of hashing power from doing, greatly reducing the risk to do so.
@_date: 2014-08-20 22:34:48


That's simply because Gavin and others were talking about making use of the large efficiency gain IBTL's give you if everyone "plays nice" to dramatically increase the blocksize. In short, I'm warning that IBTL's can quickly degrade to O(n), orders of magnitude worse performance for miners, and it is in the incentive of larger miners to delibrately make them degrade to put smaller miners out of business.
I certainly think IBTL's should be implemented, because if we don't large miners will do it anyway and outcompete smaller ones, among other things.
@_date: 2014-12-16 07:39:26
Ever looked at the SignatureHash() function?
Basically you'd make a new CHECKSIGVERIFY2 opcode that used a different way of hashing signatures, in this case hashing them without including the previous transaction hash. The transactions themselves would still refer to the previous transaction, but that's mutable data that can be changed by the miner as-needed prior to actually mining the transaction.
It's an ironic approach: make transactions *more* mutable at the lowest level to make them *less* mutable in terms of the actual effect on users. Or tl;dr: rather than trying to eliminate transaction mutability, make it irrelevant.

edit: Actually, we were just checking this on  and it looks like blockchain.info's implementation is now broken. Previously it did match output values, but now it doesn't do that anymore. I guessed someone's three step Shared Send transaction's inputs on my first try by just looking at it, and it was the only possible inputs based on output amount. Very suspicious...
tl;dr: Yet another "expert" misunderstands CoinJoin and doesn't understand the sophistication of actual implementations, and equally, the well known limitations.
What Dark Wallet actually implements is to have two classes of users, those who need a transaction done immediately, and those who are mixing coins. The latter group simply copies the output amounts of the former group, providing a set of two outputs in every CoinJoin transaction whose ownership is unknown. SharedCoin does the same thing, but with blockchain.info acting as that coin mixing group.
Secondly it's well known that any individual CoinJoin transaction doesn't magically give you good privacy by itself; inherently the anonymity set is probably only going to be two people. It's using CoinJoin for *every* transaction that is what provides privacy by *gradually* mixing your coins with those of all other users. The goal is to provide a pragmatic and low cost privacy tool that can be used for every transaction - Dark Wallet's implementation actually reduces transaction fees slightly.
This is precisely why even though I'm working with Dark Wallet as their Chief Scientist, I'm also working with Zerocash. Both solutions are good, and the advantages and disadvantages of each are complementary. Equally someone who really needs good security would be smart to also use off-chain transactions as well, e.g. EasyWallet.

That's why it needs to be combined with  reducing varience, so solo-mining becomes the most profitable way to mine.

With the colored coin app, merbinner trees(1) is exactly it, specifically summed ones. One way to think of it is we're simply having the issuer checkpoint the state periodically; the periodic checkpoints keep tx history proofs short, yet are easily auditable, and they can be easily made offline on secure machines.
For non-centralized applications, at the very least you can get O(n) coin history proofs by linearizing the history; better than that with yet more clever NI crypto. (and I need to writeup the proper paper for this one...)
1) Merbinne tree == my name for a specific form of merkelized binary prefix tree; I picked a arbitrary name to avoid confusion with other forms of binary prefix tree; nothing special about my implementation.

Be careful when you talk about "provably wrong" - Bitcoin itself is a solution to a problem that was supposed to be "provably impossible", and it (appears to!) have solved the problem by showing the requirements we thought we had were in fact too restrictive and we could solve it with looser assumptions.
Myself I suspect we'll find proof-of-stake can work well in a "semi-centralized" model where the proof-of-stake aspect allows the stakeholders to choose short-term history while long-term history is kept secure by what are ultimately centralized points of control. The thing is, so long as those points of control are only needed for long-term history it's plausible that in practice social mechanisms are sufficient to be resilient against failures.
Does this have weaker properties than Bitcoin? Probably. Is this valuable? Maybe!

That this bug even *happened* is a worrying sign for me - the underlying architecture of having a separate Ruby node implementation that re-implements the consensus rules is nuts and has broken Coinbase a dozen or so times. I and others have tried to have reasonable discussions with Coinbase about this multiple times before with no success. With regard to "busy keeping the company alive" - they might have had more time for that had they not gone down the crazy path of reimplementing Bitcoin Core from scratch.
Anyway, I mentioned it to you guys about a year ago when I noticed the service *break* and got no response, and did a test transaction more recently (~3 months ago) to see if the problem was fixed; I also find it worrying that the failure of that test transaction didn't trigger any response. Given your payment page design handles stuck transactions badly with no obvious way of fixing the problem I'd expect you to put a lot of effort into ensuring that failures are investigated. Equally the nLockTime thing has been discussed on the Bitcoin Core pull-reqs and bitcoin-development mailing list multiple times with an aim to inform wallet's that they may need to change their software; you should be keeping up to date with that development effort.
Sorry, but I could waste my time chasing up people who should know better for free and have wasted my time in the past, or I could just spend 30s tweeting about it. Note how doing the latter also ensures that there's enough attention on the issue that other wallets fix it so I (hopefully!) don't have to chase them up as well.

Do you trust me? What about Gregory Maxwell, Andrew Miller, Adam Back, Pieter Wuille? Any one of those people - and lots more - understands Bitcoin at least as well as Satoshi did, probably much better. Any one of those people could have raised the alarm had Satoshi tried to delibrately put some subtle, fundemental, flaw into Bitcoin to sabotage it. That's the magic of open source. And given the ridiculously subtle bugs we find in Bitcoin I'm confident that the core consensus codebase is in the 99.99th percentile of carefully reviewed code.
Who actually is Satoshi is one of the least interesting questions about Bitcoin.

Hahahah, nice try.
The modularity that Bitcoin Core is adding already makes life much *easier* for alts like Viacoin, not harder. I'll probably adopt some of the changes myself for python-bitcoinlib as that library is meant to be flexible, not guarantee consensus, and there's demand from python-bitcoinlib users - Viacoin included - for easier ways to port it to alts. And as you know I was one of the first people calling for the creation of a libconsensus library.
But that modularity doesn't benefit Bitcoin Core users to the extent that it's worth rushing and taking risks on, which is why Btcdrak and I are opposing the process in which it is happening. Guess what? We genuinely care about Bitcoin Core and aren't going to let our personal projects and biases outweigh the needs of the broader community. For me personally keep in mind that Viacoin is just one client of many, and those other clients all have very strong incentives to keep Bitcoin working smoothly.

@_date: 2014-04-18 17:10:17
Economics aside, the problem is that side chains can't be simultaneously secure and scalable. Either a majority of miners mine the chain, which isn't scalable, or the chain is insecure because it can be 51% attacked at no cost.

Basically Bitcoin Core now only produces transactions that use the nLockTime feature to prevent a certain attack by miners called ["fee-sniping"]( These transactions are 100% valid and can be mined immediately, but some services have broken code that rejects them. Coinbase is one of those services, and indeed, was warned about this exact problem about a year ago and did nothing to fix it. (edit: interestingly, Coinbase worked fine when I wrote the past a year and a half ago, and then broke nLockTime later)

@_date: 2014-10-23 04:14:30


Sidechains itself is a potential conflict of interest of course; the people taking the position of disgust are (mostly) the ones who agree to at least some degree with my analysis of merge-mined sidechains as being potentially harmful to the Bitcoin ecosystem. From their point of view, seeing a Bitcoin Core dev hide their paid involvement in a project with that potential is disgusting.


Sure, but I don't believe anyone I'm working for has the potential to do serious harm to the Bitcoin ecosystem; all those embedded consensus projects make use of Bitcoin as it is. I'd argue Austin Hill going around makign deals to get control of hashing power is orders of magnitude more sketchy than anything any of my clients have ever done. But I define "sketchy" in terms of total harm to non-consenting individuals.


Huh? What are these "review results" about? I have no idea what you're talking about.


I think you should talk more to me... I've spent much of my time working on ensuring that these embedded consensus systems *aren't* vulnerable to censorship. For instance, it's nice to see Blockstream implementing [contracthashtool]( an essential part of an [old idea of mine]( for representing colored-coin-type assets undetectably.
Equally, even the versions of these systems that are vulnerable to censorship are less vulnerable to censorship than they are to %51 attacks as sidechains. If 10% of the miners support a given system, 41% don't care, and the remaining 49% want to destroy it you're still better off as an embedded consensus system than as a sidechain.


What does any of that stuff have to do with projects I've been involved with?


Inefficient for whome? Again, from the point of view of the *user* of these systems using something secure and reliable rather than some dodgy centralized system, or worse, merge-mined system, is well worth the extra fees. Equally, at least in the colored coins space all my clients have grand plans for adding sidechains and hub-and-spoke micropayment schemes on top of the base layers for efficient and cheap day-to-day trading.


Honestly, I was being polite when I said that before.
Also, s/technical community/


If you think that's "slumming", than I guess that's your loss. It might do you some good to spend more time with people from a wider variety of backgrounds, technical and not, than just the narrow  community.


For starters, Ethereum is a long way away from proposing anything concrete with regard to how it'll be mined; I won't have anything to say about them until they do. They're also proposing a system with a sufficiently rich scripting language that (hopefully!) will remove most of the desire for alternate consensus systems, and equally, they're looking at adopting technologies to make their blockchain scale. If they succeed in those goals - certainly something unclear to me, but for sake of argument let say they do - then they'll pose no threat to the mining incentives landscape.
Anyway, again, what I want is there not to be incentives to be mining altcoins, merge-mined or not; adding a nifty two-way-pegging feature adds incentives.


Ah, "unlawful"... What makes you think I care about unlawful, other than to the extent I can stay out of trouble personally? I care about unethical.
My sense of ethics is such that I don't care that much how reasonably well informed adults take risks with their money, in the same way that I'm more than happy to see people - myself included - take [incredibly risks]( exploring dark muddy holes in the ground for no particular reason. Equally I've pissed off more than my fair share of projects by saying publicly what I thought of them and whether they would work; the number of times I advised people that Mastercoin was probably too complex to ever work reliably and they should use colored coins instead for their asset tracking needs while I had the title of "Mastercoin Chief Scientist" was approximately equal to the number of times people asked the question. And you know, often the "uninformed masses" that I'm sure you're about to bring up are a lot smarter than you'd think, and usually know damn well they're investing in highly uncertain projects where success rates will be in the single digits at best.
What does bother me is when people do things that harm others who haven't consented to it. Given what I believe about their effect on the decentralization of Bitcoin would I help implement merge-mined sidechains? Fuck no. Yet given the high level of mining centralization we have right now that's a choice that is really in the hands of less than a half-dozen people.
Incidentally, so what clients do you think I've worked for that you think are "outright scams"?

Simple, I had checked it, and the facts when I had checked it showed Kristov to be quite wrong. As it turns out blockchain.info subsequently broke shared coin badly, which I did not know, so Kristov's analysis was suddenly plausible again. (although it could have easily been summarized as "yeah, they don't match values so it's broken due to very well understood reasons" rather than hours of computer time and sophisticated analysis) I probably should have checked it again to be sure, but there are literally dozens of people like him saying this stuff; you run out of time in the day to check extrodinary claims.
Beyond that it's just the usual annoyance with people constantly saying Coin Join as an idea is broken because of the output value stuff, which has perfectly good countermeasures available and has been understood since day one. That blockchain.info disabled that countermeasure is suspicious, and I'd like a good explanation for how that happened. (preferably showing it was an accident!)

Suffice to say I was planning on writing up something very similar to Mike's post as an April Fools joke; to see him propose it for real is disappointing.
And yeah, basically it's easy to see how this would really quickly devolve into essentially mafia rule; coinbase reallocation is basically a protocol to allow big miners to decide on which smaller miners they want to steal money from. Never mind that a miner intentionally mining false transactions, and mining false transactions because they were attacked, is indistinguishable in a decentralized system. You're absolutely right about rewards via means other than the coinbase reward too.

I really don't think it will. pooled-solo mining requires users to run full nodes; they're not even interested in pointing their miners to anything but the biggest pool right now. Merge-mining makes the problem even worse by increasing the overhead required to be profitable, as does increasing the blocksize.
Also if crazy ideas like coinbase reallocation/blacklisting get implemented, or attempts to discourage doublespends via block discouragement, we'll find that pooled-solo doesn't work either because big centralized miners will be best at complying with the regulations imposed - pools that let pooled-solo miners operate will lose money.

Exactly my point! If I just wanted to get replace-by-fee implemented I would have made it a 50% bribe. (well, modulo cost issues!) Making it a 1% bribe is much more interesting, at least if miners do adopt replace-by-fee.
So, the way I was doing it was basically to make a steady stream of double-spends such that as one tx confirmed another was created in its place. Each "original" tx was broadcast with a generous fee, my script waited for two minutes to ensure good propagation, and then the double-spend was broadcast. I used two transactions in flight at any one time, each with a 125mBTC fee.
Given there would just three confirmations of the second tx, the double-spends, I'm a bit reluctant to publish anything concrete due to the tiny sample size. But if I get more data I'll publish something more formal.

Bitcoin works kinda the same way of course, but with the critical difference that there isn't a *built-in* mechanism by which you can profit by attacking Bitcoin. With sidechains there is: the 2-way-pegged funds you get to steal.
Now there are ways to try to work around that, for instance by forcing miners to first purchase fidelity bonds to be allowed to mine a sidechain. But it's far from a trivial problem and it's very easy to wind up fundementally changing the economics of Bitcoin; the big danger to Bitcoin is that to succesfully attack a sidechain and you need control of enough hashing power, so you are creating strong incentives for people to get centralized control of that hashing power.

Bitcoin isn't a system that is based on trust in individuals; I don't care whether or not any of you personally would try to harm Bitcoin. What I care about is whether or not systems you are creating and promoting the adoption of would create incentives and opportunities for others to harm Bitcoin, intentionally or not.
Don't take this discussion personally.


Remember our IRC discussions about 2-way-pegging with redemptions forced by the presentation of fraud proofs? That's what I'm talking about there, and it's something that Bitcoin would need a soft-fork to support. (either a dedicated opcode, or a significantly richer scripting language)
Would such a soft-fork be a good idea? Maybe! So long as the benefits outweigh the risks - encouraging merge-mining by making it more useful is one of those potential risks.


It's certainly not orthogonal to PoW-secured sidechains. We've got two main models there, mining, and merge-mining. Mining has obvious security issues with more than a trivial number of chains as hashing power is split between chains; merge-mining has obvious security issues related to encouraging centralization.
Remember that if this stuff was being discussed in academic circles there'd be no need for reddit posts. But it's being *promoted* by a for profit company with obvious incentives to get their technology implemented, incentives that may override the incentives of the Bitcoin space in general. You, Adam Back, Austin Hill, etc. are after all happy to publicly argue against the idea of embedded consensus systems, saying they are harmful to the Bitcoin ecosystem, so equally I see every reason to publicly argue against ideas that I think are harmful to the Bitcoin ecosystem.

FWIW I had nothing to do with [the tweet]( the OP is talking about; didn't tell me about it nor ask permission before using my photo.

Regarding that [short story]( it was written in consultation with multiple friends of mine who describe themselves as feminists in one way or another, including one with a degree in feminist literature; note the rather subtle joke at the end referencing the [Bechdel Test]( To say I was "mocking" the  meme is a much stronger word than I would use, although yes, I certainly wanted to create a more nuanced and balanced take on the meme, free of the negativity, [positive sterotypes]( and touches of [Magic Negro]( it's been associated with elsewhere.
@_date: 2014-04-27 18:17:31
The following I wrote in answer to that same question on [bitcointalk](
I think the most basic explanation of the difference is that in side-chains you put your trust in miners - if at any point there is a miner with enough hashing power to 51% attack the side-chain they can destroy it instantly, and often steal all the funds associated with it too. Now if a majority of *all* miners agree to mine your side-chain that may be ok and you won't be attacked, but getting to that point essentially requires asking permission from those miners if you want your side-chain to exist at all.
With tree-chains we create a global, yet scalable, blockchain publishing service that everyone contributes to and everyone uses. Everyone works together to keep that layer secure, and anyone can write code to make use of it. The disadvantage is that you can't rely on miners to verify for you - you have to verify blocks client-side - but that also means those same miners can't attack you without attacking all blockchains at once.
It's kinda like the difference between the telephone system and the internet: the telephone system relied on the underlying layer being "smart" and doing a lot of the logic for you. Adding new features to telephones meant changing that system and getting support from the phone companies. Tree-chains is the internet model: the underlying layer is very dumb and does very little, requiring fairly smart client software, however that means that to make new applications on top of that underlying layer doesn't require asking permission from anyone.

That's not as simple as you'd think. Stopping malleability is one big game of whack-a-mole - heck, just today I found two new examples of transaction malleability that I didn't know of before while reviewing sipa's patch to try to stop it.
Fortunately writing wallet software that doesn't care about malleability is not that difficult and would make for a better Bitcoin overall; it's just not how satoshi wrote the original bitcoin implementation.

With tech like hub-and-spoke micropayment channels, stopping one payment hub means no customer funds are stolen, and others pop up in their place.

Bitcoin is a decentralized system composed of anonymous actors. It's also a system that we would rather remain unregulated - I hope you argee with me that requiring legal licensing for miners would be a huge step backwards for Bitcoin.
Replace-by-fee is simply meant to ensure that we learn how to work within such a system as soon as possible. Without it we're tempted to create software and systems that depend on everyone in the ecosystem being "honest" even though we have no good way of enforcing that honesty. It also tempts us to create incentives for bad actors to attack the Bitcoin network - if everyone relys on a "seen-first" unconfirmed behavior, I can attack that and profit by attacking the network itself, isolating miners from their peers. We don't want to make that profitable.

tl;dr: Counterparty is one of a class of systems - embedded consensus systems - that end up needing a token of value for technical reasons; the best Counterparty-style systems can do is a 1-way-peg. Sidechains arguably don't have a token of value because of 2-way-pegs, however the 2-way-pegs have the problem that anyone with sufficient hashing power can come along and steal all the pegged funds; in many scenarios they're insecure when embedded consensus systems aren't.
Now rumor is that regulators are going to be warning/fining/maybe even jailing various groups in this space, Counterparty included, with charges of creating unregistered securities. Counterparty XCP was created with a technical mechanism that's pretty similar to a 1-way-peg. If they're convicted for doing that, then we're left with insecure 2-way-pegs for anyone wanting to experiment with new cyrpto-currency ideas - not ideal for us, but potentially ideal for the goals of regulators.

I recently left the Bitcoin Foundation for that reason.
Their political advocacy work was getting results and I was quite happy with it. Political advocacy is also something that needs a centralized foundation given the nature of politics.
But development works just fine with a very loose-knit group of devs, and the status quo of paying for one or two people was also working out just fine and getting results. Why change what wasn't broken?
Well, one answer might be that the Foundation's political efforts were working too well: I recently had an insider in the Foundation tell me that there was pressure to get out of politics from the corporate Foundation members who had regulation as part of their business plans - remember that providing KYC and similar services is quite profitable, and regulations act as barriers to entry for competitors.

Indeed! I also think there's a lot of people in this space who've never worked in an environment with high consequences when mistakes happen. My previous job was an electronics designer and if my designs failed to work they'd at least cost thousands of dollars of downtime - the equipment the designs went into was to be used for geological surveys costing the clients hundreds of thousands of dollars a day - and in some situations people could even be injured or killed. (an electronics fire on a small airplane is a very dangerous situation) You learned pretty quickly that having people criticise your designs in detail was both necessary, and if anything a sign of respect. If they didn't bother it was because your work was unimportant, or even worthless.

...and the miner who is taking that risk is most likely a large miner, for whome the oprhan effect isn't significant, while smaller miners with less resources and hashing power get a much higher orphan rate. Keep that up and those smaller miners will quit and move their hashing power to the bigger pool.
@_date: 2014-04-16 15:53:19
Don't think I'm trying to say "everyone is pushing for legal punishment" - I just wanted to make it clear how legal punishment is a logical next step if people start relying on unconfirmed transactions and that results in people getting hurt. That's why I specifically brought up the notion of negligence in addition to intent. The law *does* punish people whose negligence leads to harming others even if there was no malicious intent. In a world where unconfirmed transactions are trusted negligence can mean things like not having a fast enough network connection, and allowing *yourself* to be hacked, which in turn leads to negligence being not mining at a large, professionally run, legally regulated mining pool.

Remarkably enough, yes! There's all kinds of schemes for "better block sharing" that turn out to enable subtle attacks against the system that give advantages to large mining pools, as an example.
More to the point, I don't see this stuff as "black magic", just complex and with often surprising consequences to seemingly simple things. Well, ok, maybe take that as a grain of salt - I did spent 5.5 years as an analog electronics designer working on "black magic" electronics :) - but really what that taught me was that things often dismissed as "black magic" have logical explanations and *can* be understood in detail.
As for upgrades, there's a lot of low-hanging fruit that can be added to the Bitcoin scripting system. It certainly is a matter of very careful implementation and thorough tests, but there's not that much controversy about, for instance, Pieter Wuille's ideas about getting rid of malleability, or adding new modes to CHECKSIG.

@_date: 2014-09-28 21:27:55
That's not what happened at all.
Tor's doesn't currently let you create exit nodes that only allow bitcoin traffic to egress for boring technical reasons - you in fact used to be able to do that, but it got broken by improved network monitoring that's just not sophisticated enough to allow exit nodes that are Bitcoin only. If someone did the (hard) work to make that possible the Tor devs would likely merge in their changes. Operating Bitcoin nodes as hidden services works fine anyway and only results in a small increase in latency that in the context of Bitcoin doesn't matter very much. (particularly for the SPV usage Mike is interested in for bitcoinj)
Where the controversy was between Mike and the Tor devs was because Mike proposed that Tor *not* fix an exploit that allows *relay* nodes to determine what *hidden services* people are trying to use. Mike proposed this because he wanted people to be able to blacklist hidden services and thus not donate bandwidth to their usage.
Someone was running a *huge* exit node that only allowed Bitcoin traffic... but because of the above the exit node was 100% broken and wasn't getting any legitimate usage; very suspicious! Operating such an exit node would allow you to survail Bitcoin usage, and given Mikes support for blacklisting a well-known Tor dev speculated publicly on twitter that Mike might be the person running it. He's denied doing that, and there's no evidence one way or the other.
In any case, I've personally spoken to Tor devs about this, and they are very enthusiastic to see more Bitcoin nodes and clients using Tor. Jacob Applebaum for instance personally asked me to make Bitcoin Core releases use Tor by default, and was excited to hear that bitcoinj was (does?) have support for Tor.
@_date: 2014-12-13 07:13:35

See my other [reply]( here. If it's a criminal case, you'd have to prove intent, but the more interesting and likely example is a civil case, where they only have to prove negligence. What constitutes negligence will likely be "you didn't mine at a big, professionally run pool" if we're to make unconfirmed transactions safe.

A paper is a *long* way away from a production-ready system.
Anyway, I know very well that there are risks, but again, in the case of Zerocash I certainly see the benefits - anonymity for Bitcoin sooner rather than later - as outweighing the risks. And like I've said before, I'm quite confident *the public* will be willing to use a system with that risk.
Keep in mind that a backdoored SNARK trusted setup *can't* break any user's privacy; I personally care more that we can't harm people by revealing their identity than we can't harm people by having a system fail, making their money worthless. Buy only the Zerocash that you can afford to lose!

You don't even need to do that, just do what DarkWallet does and have "send my tx now" users and "mix my coins" users and have the latter match the amounts the former want to send. It's simple, user friendly, and blockchain.info *already* acts as the latter type of user as they participate in every mix as a mix partner. 
Frankly for them not to fix this issue is a sign of either incompetence or malice. I would not be surprised if they are deliberately leaving the service broken; hopefully I'm wrong and they've fixed it recently, but I haven't heard otherwise.

No, the correct term there was could care less.
@_date: 2014-11-05 04:00:31
That they do. The irony with those vulnerabilities is that what's required to fix them - SNARKs - is the exact same advanced cryptography that can be used to give treechains O(1) scaling, AKA the SPV mode that maaku7 is saying they don't have. At the same time, even SNARKs can't fix the mining centralization issues sidechains have, at which point you might as well consider making the sidechains into.. oh I dunno, maybe some time of binary tree... :)
Also, maaku7 is mistaken - with existing cryptography and some economic tricks we certainly can get a semi-SPV mode where the proof that a coin is valid is O(n) in size. Large certainly - on the order of say a few MB to tens of MB of data depending on how you do it - but still feasible. I'm working on a colored coin library right now for a client, and the problem of proving colored coins exist is essentially the same problem that you have in treechains; my plan is to take that code and port it over to a tree-chains model once it's further developed.
I'll admit I'm getting kinda annoyed by how various people on the sidechain team keep repeating this, given I've explained my ideas re: SPV many times over to them. Obviously those ideas might turn out to not work in the end, but it'd be much more fair to simply say "Peter has some as yet untested ideas for SPV"

Bingo. The whole reason I came up with the idea(1) was because Amir Taaki and I were trying to figure out how to embed a Bitcoin address in a OpenPGP key without screwing up privacy. Why would you want to put an address in an OpenPGP key? So that you can verify that you actually have the right address with the web-of-trust.

Yeah, I had an interesting discussion with a long-time opensource dev about this topic recently, and I think it's fair to say my previous work experience - electronics design at a hardware startup mainly run by aerospace engineers - gave me a lot of communication habits that are inappropriate in open-source development culture. In particular my previous work was done in-person with a close-knit group, where what you say has much less impact than it does online. Everyone has an extremely thick skin when you work together directly; not true at all with physically isolated opensource development. It also doesn't help that in my previous work failures tending to be very high consequence, leading to a culture of never-ending criticism. Heck, in my previous work if someone didn't take the time to criticise your ideas it probably meant they weren't important, somewhat of an insult! I'm realizing that this just doesn't exist in opensource development.
There's also the cultural difference that in hardware often peoples' entire jobs are review and testing - they do nothing but take others' designs and criticise them. In hardware that work is respected at least as much, usually even more, than creating the design in the first place. In software I'm realizing there is a culture where you are only able to criticise others' code if you write a lot of code yourself. I don't contribute that much code to the Bitcoin Core effort, and what I do contribute tends to be unit tests, so I'm sure that has caused friction as well.

Yeah, it's pretty simple: prefix filters trade off giving slightly more information about your coins to everyone, in exchange for removing the need to give almost perfect information about the coins to blockchain data servers, AKA full nodes. If you have a data server that you can trust, e.g. you're using Electrum/Dark Wallet and trust the guys running those servers not to reveal your info, you don't need them and can use "full strength" stealth addresses/BIP32 wallets.
Where prefix filters come into play is if you don't have such trustworthy servers available, which is the case if you're querying random full-nodes on the network. The way BIP32 wallets are designed soon forces you into either using up a lot of bandwidth, or revealing a lot of info about your wallet - for instance Android Wallet uses a false-positive setting of ~1/20,000 or so, which gives an attacker *very* accurate info about the coins in your wallet. Prefix filters give that attacker much less accurate info, in exchange for giving everyone some more info. tl;dr: it's not perfect, but it's an easy to understand tradeoff without hidden "gotchas" that can be implemented with very simple math, and is compatible with future miner-committed blockchain indexes to prevent people from trying to hide payments from you.

I'm not saying ghash.io is selfish, I'm saying people pointing hashing power at them, and people who bought hosted hashing power from them, are being selfish and ignoring the long term consequences to Bitcoin in favor of a quick buck. (of course, many were simply ignorant)
With that much hashing power in the hands of a single party you run a real risk of that party acting *irrationally* for whatever reason, be it ignorance, or being forced to act in some way. (IE government/hackers gain control of ghash.io) In short, it's much more likely for a single person to act irrationally against their interests, and the interests of Bitcoin as a whole, than for thousands to do so all at once.
But Bitcoin has a whole variety of incentives to mine at pools that a better designed system wouldn't have unfortunately.

No actually! You can do it as a soft-fork the same way P2SH was implemented.

Right, but as I've argued many times before, trying to tighten "no double spending" beyond the 10 minute confirmation time harms smaller miners as they aren't as well connected as larger ones; if they are sybil attacked their blocks get discouraged and the hashers selling hashing power to them have every incentive to move to a larger pool.
Ultimately of course you're proposing a mechanism that allows a majority of miners to take funds from a minority at no cost. If that majority can ever do so, either openly or through subterfugue like sybil attacks on smaller miners (claiming they were double-spending) then you've centralized bitcoin further.

Sure, but a PM means other people aren't going to learn from it too. Same reason I told Mike that that other people had stopped engaging in conversation with him re: soft-forks publicly rather than in a PM. I've *far* more often said this stuff privately to people, and much more tactfully... but did you learn anything from those private emails? Nope.
Of course, the above is certainly the kind of thing that can hurt feelings on a personal level, but Gavin and Mike (and myself!) are 'big boys' and can take it so I'll make an exception to the usual rule of conducting such business in private. Equally it's really common for people, including business types like investors, to ask me for for insight into the dynamics of how devs actually feel about each other. The above is exactly what I say, and I think it's unfair and a even bit deceptive to say that kind of stuff privately behind peoples' backs, and equally, deny that frank insight to people who can't afford to attend conferences and talk to me in person.
You know, I've built my consulting business on honesty. I've got so many clients who are direct competitors with conflicting interests that if I ever started self-censoring my opinions I'd be quickly accused of having hidden agendas - and that happens already! It's a tricky position to be in, but my philosophy is to err on the side of openness. It can give the appearance of a toxic environment when quoted out of context, but I'm confident that on balance I'm spent more than my fair share of time helping people get involved in Bitcoin development and ensuring they had the ability to get involved in meaningful ways.

That's not a very good picture of what's going on. The "pro-decentralization" camp you talk about very much "pro-scalability" and are working hard to make Bitcoin scale, but without sacrificing that decentralization. The off-chain transactions I and others were working on last year was one approach, and the easiest low-risk approach for the ecosystem as a whole. More recent work has been on making blockchains themselves more scalable by splitting them up - "sharding" - with structures such as trees. I've got one approach called Tree Chains that I'm working on, and others are working on other parts of that problem and other approaches. (e.g. p2pool's forrestv is also working on decentralizing mining in p2pool without the requirement for the whole blockchain)
I think a much better description is you've got two camps, one who thinks a decentralized Bitcoin is priority  and the other who either don't care, or just don't understand the technical limits. Within the academic community actually studying this stuff essentially everyone accepts that blockchains just don't scale very well, and it's unknown how far we can push this rocket assisted flying pig. But believe me, people are working very hard at doing just that.

Thinking development work has slowed down misunderstands what work needs to be done. Right now there's lots of possible upgrades to the protocol, but the underlying theory is still very poorly understood so we don't really know how to implement those upgrades correctly or what exactly they should be. Fortunately there are a *lot* of academics and other researchers working on better understanding those issues; we just don't see their work because it doesn't (yet) translate into github pull requests. All in all this is a good thing, because we're finding out that a lot of our earlier ideas on how to upgrade the protocol are downright harmful.
I'm sure Lighthouse will be a useful app, but the slow pace of Bitcoin protocol changes has less to do with money than many people realize.

We grudgingly like people writing alt-implementations, because we learn more about the edge cases. We're terrified of people actually using them for mining, as well as solely relying on them. 
Also, the core consensus code is gradually being turned into a standalone protocol standard library for everyone to use for validation.

And you know, the funny thing is while his political views happen to be fairly extreme, what he actually does for Bitcoin is boring politically moderate stuff: letting people transact on their own terms with freedom and privacy. It's easy to forget these days, but those economic and social freedoms have been the cornerstone of western style democracies for literally hundreds of years.

Read my tree chains paper and my previous one on disentangling Bitcoin mining. It's actually totally ok if miners don't verify anything at all provided that users do.

Nope, you're describing a specific way of using hashlocked transactions, but the idea is more general than that.
Hashlocked just means that you need to provide a digest preimage to spend the funds. For instance an oracle might tell people it'll release some secret such that Hash(secret)=pubhash if some event happens. Then Alice and Bob could create a scriptPubKey like:
    IF
        HASH pubhash EQUALVERIFY &lt;alice&gt; CHECKSIG
    ELSE
        2 &lt;alice&gt; &lt;bob&gt; 2 CHECKMULTISIG
    ENDIF
Now Alice needs Bob's co-operation to spend the funds, except if the event happens and the oracle releases the secret. The oracle could just release a secret key too, but in some cases you want the oracle to be unable to let anyone spend the funds without letting *everyone* spend the funds - because the secret has to be put in the transaction it becomes public info the moment you spend the tx.

You don't need to perform a finney attack to break zero-conf transaction security:
Bitpay and Coinbase do *not* accept zeroconf transactions; they show a payment as "received" the moment it's sent, but merchants who actually take irreverable actions based on a payment are advised to only take those actions after a confirmation. You'll see the occasional merchant work this way, e.g. digital downloads. It's just something you don't see very often because very few merchants are actually in a position where they have that problem.

Note that stealth transactions are designed so that if used with a payment protocol the common case is you just give the nonce and other transaction info to the receipient directly. Scanning the blockchain for stealth payments is meant to be a *backup* in case that communications mechanism fails - or doesn't exist! - and can be implemented in a way that uses no extra blockchain space for a slight reduction in privacy. (at least if you're using CoinJoin) Mike seems to have misunderstood this aspect of the design; I'll admit I could have made it more clear.
@_date: 2014-01-23 18:00:44
Well, keep in mind that decentralized consensus systems tend to be anything but agile by their very nature - change and consensus just don't go together very well.
Lets start with something concrete: As I've said before, you certainly don't have the hardware background required to be judging PoW algorithms, and I have at best enough hardware background to "judge the judges". So how about we start with a preliminary, smaller-scale, and cheaper, effort to find a digital/ASIC electronics designer who does have that background and get a preliminary report done on the kind of problem we're up against so we have some good criteria by which to judge entries to a future PoW contest. Without that I just don't think we have the ability to know what makes for a good PoW, and we're going to wind up awarding prizes to the wrong people.
As an example, note that recent insights by Gregory Maxwell suggest that the whole idea behind scrypt - ASIC hardness through die-area hardness - is probably flawed and actually makes it *cheaper* for an attacker to crack scrypt-protected passwords. What scrypt should have done is optimize for most joules expended effectively, something a pure-memory-hard design isn't good at. Without that insight you'd probably wind up giving prize-money to a team who did the exact opposite. Yet to a hardware designer it's sufficiently obvious that when I was talking to a good electrical engineer a few days ago about PoW algorithms - someone who had never heard of them before - they recognized within literally minutes that power-usage was probably more important than die space.
If you're interested, let me know, and I'll start working through my contacts in the industry. (those reading this should know that prior to Mastercoin I worked as an electronics designer) I'll figure out what deliverables we want for an initial report and what kind of budget we have; I think Mastercoin should contribute funds to this effort as well.

Theoretical scalability; he's still giving the impression of a multiple order of magnitude improvement, which is what the community has obviously taken from the writeup.
Remember that with regard to miners and orphans, IBLT isn't a 0.5 improvement, it's can be an orders of magnitude improvement compared to the worst case because peak bandwidth is what matters. But that assumes everyone "plays nice", which I'm arguing they have no incentive to for various reasons; Gavin has brought this up with me in the past with regard to anonymous mining.

trying to get it working by accepting huge amounts of relay bandwidth.




intercepting the connections, but I seem to not be able.

Good riddance. Look at the IRC discussion from when CVE-2013-4627 was exploited: I wrote up a quick patch that even deployed on a *minority* of nodes fixed the issue for the *majority*. It turned out that patch opened up an additional, less serious flaw, which wasn't caught by review. My patch was cleaned up and committed by Jeff Garzik - I didn't submit a pull-req nor did I write the exact code committed - and a v0.8.3 was released without my knowledge.
Why without my knowledge? Because a day after I wrote that patch I wound up in hospital for a week. Needless to say, reviewing it more carefully prior to release wasn't at the top of my priority list...

You realise that in Bitcoin we had a bug where we didn't validate transactions properly, allowing creation of arbitrary Bitcoins, and "we" handled that bug by arbitrarily issuing a new version of the code that retroactively rolled back the fraudulent transactions and all their dependent transactions?
Or how the same thing happened in Namecoin, and again the fraudulent transfers were arbitrarily rolled back with a new version of the Namecoin software?
What Counterparty is doing is tricky from a *software engineering* point of view for a variety of reasons, but it ultimately doesn't need to be done any differently from how Bitcoin and sidechains work: community consensus determines what sourcecode defines the protocol, and in turn what happens.
The only difference is that in Bitcoin you can use PoW as a way of *measuring* how much support there is for a particular version of the protocol; embedded consensus systems like Counterparty tend not to implement such measurement, although they could via stake-based methods.

We're not ready to do a soft-fork yet; the opcode still needs people to actually write some demo apps using it to make sure there isn't something in the design that we've missed. For instance, it's not 100% clear if gmaxwell's suggestion of making CLTV compare against the nLockTime field in the transaction doesn't have some hidden downsides that we haven't thought of yet. Similarly I recently had a discussion with greenaddress that indicates it'd probably make sense to also have a "get txout height" opcode to allow the creation of scripts that lock their outputs for a specific amount of time after they have been mined rather than just prevent spending until a *specific* point in time.
I have an [open pull-req]( that would enforce CLTV in the mempool, but *not* enforce it in the blockchain itself. This should make it easy to test out CLTV in applications that will use it.
You can also test it on Viacoin testnet, which enabled it last weekend, and Viacoin mainnet should have it enabled early next January.

Conceptually simple is likely to not work either. gmaxwell suggested schemes that are complex actually to use as many CPU features as possible, especailly things like SIMD instructions and flaoting point. But that only really works in the case of a KDF where you can just do a library of per-cpu-model functions. For a PoW you can't do that because you need to think about the future.


I'll get started then.

Complete anonymity no - CoinJoin is well understood to not be perfect. But matching output values works, the cost per transaction is low, it's easy to understand why it works and easy to see when it isn't working.
@_date: 2014-06-13 23:32:19
The main difference is that what Dark Wallet is doing is much simplier and easier to see in action. There's two classes of users, those who just want to send transactions now, and those who have coins sitting around that they want mixed. The former sends funds, and the latter matches at least one of the output values. Each time that creates two outputs whose owners are unknown.
This isn't "impressive" looking, the transactions only have a few inputs and outputs, but it's easy to understand exactly how much more privacy you're getting each time you do a transaction. Over time it'll build up to a reasonably large anonymity set. (we hope!)
Shared Coin was I think just too complex for its own good: lots of additional inputs and outputs added by the algorithm, but that just made what it was actually doing less clear. Better to keep things simple and easy to analyze for now.

Basically it's a way to encrypt a file with a weak key constructed so the key can be decrypted in a specified amount of time. The decryption process uses long chains of hashes so it can't be parallelized - one fast CPU can decrypt the file faster than a million slightly slower CPUs. Moores law long ago ended for scalar performance - CPU clock speeds haven't budged in years - so predicting how long it'll take for the decryption to happen is possible. Secondly since decrypting the timelock lets you also collect Bitcoins, unrelated third-parties are incentivized to do the decryption for you, and additionally, them doing that automatically makes the decrypted keys public.
To answer your question, it could be. For instance a journalist might want to make sure some documents get eventually leaked in a few years no matter what happens to them personally. A more prosaic use-case is something like greenaddress.it, where they might use timelock crypto on the secret keys they hold, to ensure that funds can always be recovered even if they suddely disappear. (they use nLockTime for that right now; timelock would give an additional "belt-and-suspenders" backup)
I'm working with the Zerocash team and we're thinking of using timelock crypto to create a testnet Zerocash chain. We'd timelock encrypt the private parameters used to initialize the chain, ensuring that in the future those parameters will be cracked and the testing chain become worthless no matter what.

I'd say it's about as half-baked as sidechains is right now, which is to say, pretty half-baked! We still have some fundemental issues to figure out in detail like how exactly to handle data loss at lower levels of the tree, as well as some potential incentive issues Adam Back raised. That said it's undergone a decent amount of review by academics, and those two issues seem to be the only things being brought up, which is promising. Also, I'd really like to see how this zk-SNARK moon-math pans out; if recursive zk-SNARKS work out in practice it'll make actually doing useful things with tree-chains quite a bit easier.
Note how in my previous thread on what we should do about GHash.IO I mainly talked about adding something like p2pool to the bitcoin protocol, not tree-chains, and for good reason! While P2Pool can't solve scalability, it can help solve mining decentralization and it's a much simplier idea. I'm confident you could add it to the bitcoin protocol with a few months work and get it right; tree chains would take a fair bit longer.

It's more complex than that. 
I promoted off chain transactions as a way to avoid having to just lift the block size limit. Under the hood though the anti-fraud technologies they need to be secure require it to be possible to publish arbitrary data in the block chain so as to come to consensus about what services have committed fraud. 
Equally I've argued for a long time that provided scalability is solved, data in the block chain is something for market forces to handle. It was really when I started thinking about Mastercoin that the "lightbulb went off" and I realized that the core of Bitcoin was actually about censorship resistant data publishing, leading to my paper about proof-of-publication: 
Finally, this morning I published what I consider a followup to that paper, a new block chain structure called tree chains with the aim of making the block chain scale while staying decentralised: 
What's interesting about it IMO is how its really an adjustable security way of publishing data - it doesn't need to be implemented in a model where miners actually verify anything at all. Yet, if used for a transactional currency there's no limit on how many transactions per second the whole system can scale too.
Edit: oh, and I'm not CTO, I'm Chief Scientist. My job is focused on researching decentralised finance in general, hence my interest in improving the scalability of bitcoin itself.  I also don't work for just Mastercoin, I also work for Counterparty, Coloured Coins, Litecoin, and others.

...where almost all of the actual innovation happens. Keep in mind that Bitcoin Core itself is like the lowest layer in a networking stack - extremely important, but it doesn't and shouldn't change often. The change happens above that stable base-layer; all the projects actually using Bitcoin to do things.


And I'm a case in point! While I do get paid partly to improve Bitcoin Core, most of what my clients are paying for - and what I actually do on Bitcoin Core - is just improved testing and assurance that Bitcoin Core itself actually works. Not the easiest thing to justify billing for, but I at least manage. The innovative projects I'm excited about are nearly all things that don't require any changes to Bitcon Core, with the exception of CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY and treechains - note how the former is often described as "the obvious thing Satoshi should have done on day 1", so I'd almost call it a bugfix. The latter is research, not really development.

1 beer As I said elsewhere, the problem with the patch was the likelyhood that a user wouldn't be aware of it; the patch itself is a good reminder that we all need to use Bitcoin in ways that are maximally censorship resistant. Reusing addresses is anything but. There was a *long* discussion in the Mastercoin git repo last month on this topic, which I think can be summed up in Ron Gross's [reply](




and I have even been thinking about putting a statistical 'non-encrypted-data' blocker in Viacoin that would reject transactions containing data that failed statistical randomness tests. Encrypted data would pass, as would randomly generated pubkeys, but trying to put unencrypted plaintext - e.g. ASCII text - would fail and be blocked. Doing this would force all embedded consensus protocols to use steganographic techniques, thereby giving node operators and miners plausible deniability with respect to what transactions on the network are doing. Adam Back was proposing even stronger versions of this last year that would essentially encrypt all transactions, resulting in the entire network operating 'blind' with respect to what's happening on it.
It's the exact same logic behind why Freenet and Tor encrypt everything: I don't want to know what the blockchain is being used for, because if I do, I can be pressured into censoring "bad" transactions on it.

Simple: had blockchain.info been doing Coin Join correctly, and they were the last time I had checked, your analysis would have been very wrong. Equally you could have simply written up your findings as "Yeah, blockchain.info doesn't hide values properly, so it's obviously broken due to well understood reasons" - the fancy statatistical analysis just makes you look like yet another crank you doesn't understand the tech. After all, when I looked at a Coin Join last night I was able to spot the inputs correctly in seconds just by eyeballing the values, something that shouldn't be possible because there should be a guaranteed k-anonymity set caused by matching.
Sorry that I didn't check that it was still working when I replied, but frankly there are so many people making claims like this, usually bogus, that fact checking everyone in detail is impossible. In any case, I'm leaving up my original reply to keep my mistake in the public record.

The "cruft in the UTXO" set issue was fixed long ago with the dust-limit; Satoshidice transactions *do* get spent these days as they're quite profitable to spend. Note how the dust-limit fix was applied equally to all users.
Having said that, it is useful to the ecosystem to have people like Luke-Jr around remininding us that we all should be using Bitcoin in ways that are difficult to censor. It's good for the whole ecosystem if trying to blacklist any one usage of Bitcoin is impractical - that's why we consistently tell people not to reuse addresses, among other things.

Embedded consensus schemes like Counterparty have more features - at the cost of scalability and complexity - but decentralised exchanges can be built on coloured coins as well.

Like I said, the "education" I've seen and been told about is often wring and even could be taken as deceptive. For instance I know the design of Factom was driven by a strong desire to avoid block chain bloat, Luke-Jr helped review it, and the trade offs it makes to achieve that goal are downright dangerous.
Equally by glossing over these issues we mislead the wider community and make bad decisions based on bad data gathered while Bitcoin is still small enough for social pressure to appear to work. For instance as I've said before, even prior to coming up with an alternative, UTXO commitments can make "bad" uses of Bitcoin more attractive. Equally I find it kinda suspicious that I was apparently the first to come up with the idea, given its so simple, which makes me suspect people aren't looking at tradeoffs objectively; you're more likely to come up with solutions when you accept there may be a problem.

Unconfirmed transactions have already been shown to be highly insecure and relying on them invites people to attack the Bitcoin network itself. We're much better off being honest to users about how their lack of security as-is and implementing real security.
You know, at one point the whole internet was unencrypted and unauthenticated, and peoples' traffic was often snooped on and systems broken into. At the time there was of course lots of chastising of admins reading email, and crackers breaking into systems. But how were the problems actually fixed?

His [merge-avoidance]( proposal is a good example: an alternative to CoinJoin designed to sacrifice some of the privacy that CoinJoin offers in exchange for making blacklisting feasible.

Interestingly what you're suggesting is very closely related to how secure micropayment channels work; using a micropayment channel directly is another option.

What's really hard about testing Bitcoin is not only do you have to catch "accidental" things that trigger bugs, but you have to detect extremely subtle changes in behavior that could be *exploited* by an attacker. Basically anything that may make one node accept a block that another won't can turn into a fork that at minimum causes some miner to lose a few thousand dollars worth of bitcoins.
I seriously don't believe the state of software engineering is good enough to really deal with this properly, and I'm not alone in this opinion. If you're not convinced, try reading my recent writeup on the subject: [The difficulty of writing consensus critical code: the SIGHASH_SINGLE bug](

Its prefix filtering for now, which helps ensure you aren't giving info about the coins in your wallet to the servers you connect to. Future we're definitely going to look at more advanced crypto; prefix filters do have a privacy/bandwidth tradeoff. However it is important to remember that prefix filters "fail soft" unlike the existing Bloom filters that give *very* specific information about what addresses you own to whom you connect to if you are to use a reasonable amount of bamdwidth; connect to the "NSA" or whatever once and they know with 99.99% certainty what addresses are in your wallet with Multibit right now.

re: voluntary, remember that the proposal is specifically to *change* the rules in a hard-fork. The "reallocated" coinbase value is not allowed to be spent, and other blocks have coinbases with a higher subsidy than allowed by the current rules to put the coins back in circulation. Obviously applying this kind of thing to any transaction output at all via miner-vote is an easy next step.
Where "voluntary" really comes into it is that you should be using Bitcoin clients that validate the blockchain, either in full or in co-operation with others w/ fraud proofs, and don't just trust miners to do it. Basically there you've voluntarily decided to just trust the majority of miners.
@_date: 2014-01-18 13:17:46
Remember that transaction fees are a supply and demand system, essentially your transaction fee is a bid for blockchain space and miners build blocks starting with the most profitably transactions first.
Gavin's estimation scheme makes it easier for Bitcoin users to figure out what the transaction demand is and what kind of bid they'll need to outbid other users and get their transactions mined as fast as they want them too. But that doesn't necessarily make fees go down, in fact I've tested that estimator and I expect it to lead to fees going *up* as people with high value transactions can more easily automate the process of ensuring their bids are high enough to get their transactions mined quickly.
@_date: 2014-06-10 06:29:45
Shared Coin and Dark Wallet's coin join implementation both ensure that values get matched. If you send 1.3872 bitcoins through either there will be more than one output with that value.
Of course, if you start with exactly 1.3872 bitcoins, you can be identified that way, but that's why you should use coinjoin for all your transactions rather than just occasionally. In Dark Wallet doing that is actually slightly cheaper than not - CoinJoin transactions are a bit smaller per user than normal ones because one header can be shared across multiple participants.

The problem is if you want to find more blocks then your competition you only have an incentive to get your block to about 30% of the hashing power(1), *not* 100%. This is distinct from the incentive to find the most blocks possible; in my scenario the large miner is taking a small short-term loss of profit from the inflation subsidy in exchange for putting their competition out of business. In the future as the inflation subsidy decreases and tx fees become important it translates directly into a short-term increase in profit - even more dangerous.

Block withholding can be fixed, an. or we can get rid of the *need* for pools at all - everyone could mine solo with low variance. Treechains would do that, although if all you want is low-varience there are other approaches too.
One interesting issue is that the latter - getting rid of the need for pools - conflicts with sidechaina as they aren't practical for small solo miners due to admin overhead.
@_date: 2014-06-13 09:58:40
It would, but not by much. Even a 30s block interval just decreases it 20x, while p2pool decreases it thousands of times because of how it both combines many shares in the share chain together, and lets miners with different hashing power rates have different difficulties.

"sophisticated two-way [(merge)-mined]-sidechains"
(Merge)-mined sidechains aren't as sophisticated as people make them out to be. They simply put their trust in miners and hope those miners behave honestly, something which they are meant to be incentivised to do; incentivising anonymous parties not to steal large amounts of value locked up in 2-way-pegs is non-trivial. The technology is actually an extension of my (fidelity-bonded) off-chain transaction ideas to allow the off-chain transaction provider to be defined not as a specific identity, but rather as whomever controls the most hashing power.
So what's actually going on? You put money into the system by paying to a special two-way peg address. At it's simpliest this is just a (multisig) address controlled by the off-chain transaction provider - AKA the bank. Better is to make the multisig be redeemable by proving to the blockchain that according to some protocol you have the right to the funds. Transactions happen on the ledger/sidechain, signed by the bank, and when you want to get your money out you either ask the bank nicely to give it back, or if that fails, you can use the ledger/sidechain as proof that you deserve the funds. (I and Gregory Maxwell developed this idea [back in early 2013](
What merge-mined sidechains add to this is the idea that rather than the bank being defined as a cryptographic identity, we define the bank as whomever has 50% of the hashing power mining that particular sidechain. This has some advantages, the chief one being that the sidechain can continue to exist even if the bank fails. (though remember that you *can* get your money out in a off-chain-transaction system/non-mined-sidechain) However you also have the huge disadvantage that anyone who can 51% attack the sidechain - which may involve a lot less hashing power than needed to 51% attack Bitcoin as a whole - can steal the funds locked up by the 2 way peg. (possibly fixed by some very fancy and not-yet-production-ready crypto)
Now people can argue about the fairness of how Counterparty's token was created, but on a technical level using a token rather than a two-way-peg has the advantage of security: who owns what tokens is defined by the Bitcoin blockchain, and changing that record requires you to 51% attack Bitcoin as a whole.

People all too often cite Satoshi as an example of a genius who came down from the mountain with Bitcoin on stone slates to give to us all. Much more accurate is to say Satoshi had one good idea, a whole lot of bad ones, and not that much programming skil, yet he still managed to change the world.

They haven't been hit quite as hard as Mt.

I think it's interesting how - an account that's repeatedly trolled me in the past and appears to have no other purpose - quoted my tweet with a very misleading and much more inflammatory headline then what I actually wrote. (I did not "predict a blockchain fork on twitter") That got followed up by a throwaway account making lots of rapid-fire accusations and noise in the same thread - I'd suspect the same person. Then you have repeatedly misstating the situation in the thread, for instance by trying to portray the situation as one of Viacoin having difficulty with merging changes, when we're quite clearly concerned about overall development practices and the risks being taken with regard to consensus-critical code. (e.g. see [Jeff Garzik's take on it](

That quickly turns Bitcoin into a centralized system, requiring the co-operation of a small number of specific people in the community to run. In some situations stopping that attack that way may be pretty clear, but in others, not at all. For instance if someone was able to steal the FBI's private keys to the silk road funds, and the 51% attack was to keep them from moving, would Gavin and co feel they could step in? I highly doubt it.

Oh for sure, but even in that case the "altcoins-vs-Bitcoins" war is the wrong way to go about that. Remember that crypto is a mindshare thing, so if you give the impression that you're weak it can be a self-fufilling prophecy. Better to consistently present a strong image publicly.

Indeed. Gregory Maxwell likes to point out that attacks are probabalistic, so if you want to reverse, say, 6 confirmations and have 41% (IIRC) of hashing power you have a 50:50 chance of succeeding. There's lots of exchanges and similar out there where that'd be a worthwhile attack, especially if you can get the hashing power by hacking a pool, or if you attack multiple targets at once.

Basically they make it easy to verify PGP keys by verifying them against statements made by user accounts on services - essentially turning those services into certificate authorities. But unlike traditional CA's, you can verify an identity from multiple sources so as to prevent any one CA from being fully trusted.
keybase.io's implementation leaves much to be desired, but the basic idea is a very good one and I hope it catches on. Merging the WoT ideas and trusted CA models gives you the best of both worlds, and helps keep CA's honest.

I'm sure there are solutions from a technical point of view. I'm far from sure those solutions can be implemented from a political point of view.

You realise we're in violent agreement here?
As my comment history shows I use changetip all the time and think they're an excellent, exceptionally well executed service. We've got that in the Bitcoin world because multiple people have tackled the problem - only possible because Bitcoin is free of the FinTech regulations that otherwise prevent startups from being created at all - and one of those services has finally nailed the problem.
That they happen to be a centralized service doesn't bother me at all - from a technical point of view it's the best architecture to keep costs low and the user experience fluid and easy. Their architecture may involve no technical innovation at all, but often trying to be technically "innovative" is the wrong approach! And again, I've argued quite strongly that we should embrace centralized off-chain payment schemes in the past, and did quite a bit of work on [finding ways to improve their security](
That's the beauty of Bitcoin: we have a strongly decentralized and permissionless base layer of value, and we can build whatever suits our needs on top of it. Sometimes that's decentralized systems, sometimes that's highly centralized systems. But what you choose to use is 100% up to you.

FWIW, this "suckage" has lead to tens of thousands of dollars of reported losses before the people involved quit trying to make zeroconf transactions secure by themselves.
Of course, that's not to say you can't accept zeroconf payments, but you need something other than Bitcoin to keep your losses acceptable.

Correct. However the creator of the timelock gets to compute it in parallel by computing multiple chains. Each chain starts from an initialization vector (IV) and once a chain is computed the secret of one chain is used to encrypt the IV of the next. Only the first IV is released to the public, forcing everyone else to compute the chain the slow way, serially.
@_date: 2014-04-27 00:40:17
Not really - experiments have a way of not going away. Adam suggested it as a "beta channel" for the purpose of testing real world economic behavior, but real world economic behavior requires the chain to be valuable, and at that point it becomes harmful to Bitcoin's decentralization. Of course, you certainly can argue that "just a bit of side-chains" is ok, but again, once the infrastructure is written a few often turn into many - just witness how many altcoins there are!

Like I've said before, I'm trying to maintain a policy of not engaging with trolls; I didn't comment on this thread at all until you started talking in it.
You're kinda putting me in a damned if I do, damned if I don't position with that argument.


That's a very simple accusation: blockstream devs have said in the past that they're interested in re-using Bitcoin Core code for sidechains and altcoins, which poses a conflict of interest between their needs for clean reusable code and the broader Bitcoin Core communities desires for stable code that doesn't break. already *has* that conflict of interest - the refactorings in question make life much easier for viacoin - and is quite wisely avoiding it with his actions against his own best interests.
Similarly I have lots of people, some of whome paying clients, who are bugging me to push the CLTV patch forward and get a soft-fork ASAP. I've told them repeatedly that it's just not going to happen that fast because the needs of the broader community outweigh their relatively niche interests. And I think that's a much smaller and less risky change than the large refactorings being done right now.

Schneier's book Cryptography Engineering has a section on PRNG's that's worth reading, but you know, frankly it's actually a topic that's sufficiently simple to get bike-shedded all the time. I'd have to dig up the exact quote - it's on the cryptography mailing list - but kernel dev Theodore Ts'o said essentially that two or three weeks ago in frustration after a particularly long-lived thread on the subject.
Doing something as simple as keeping a long-running 32-byte pool, adding randomness to that pool with pool=SHA256(pool + new bytes), and extracting bytes from the pool with pool = SHA256(pool + time()); random_bytes = pool; is actually pretty much ok. There are ways for the above to fail, but the fact that the above is 95% of the way there should tell you something about how PRNG's aren't actually a very hard problem. What is hard about them is being sure you've covered all the implementation-specific ways they can fail, and even harder, convincing others on a mailing list that you've done that successfully!

Yeah, if getutxo had at least some privacy protections I probably would have grudgingly ACKed it, simply because that reduces the attack risks significantly by making directed attacks harder.

You don't need global consensus or a blockchain for that though; the OpenPGP key itself can contain the metadata required for your local client to connect to those same services and verify public signed statements.

As Mastercoin's Chief Scientist I think decentralized consensus systems with extrospective scripting languages are vital building blocks and Mastercoin is going to either be one, or use one as a base layer; Ethereum *is* innovative and new.
However will Ethereum be *the* next gen crypto-system? The general opinion of the crypto-currency dev/theory community is that the broad idea is good, but they could really use some expert help. Jeff has a good point: ideas tested in Ethereum can easily be improved and implemented in a better system, be it Bitcoin or something else.

My thoughts on the matter:
I'm very against the name "reusable addresses" and strongly believe we should stick with the name stealth addresses.
You gotta look at it from the perspective of a user; lets take standard pay-to-pubkey-hash addresses: I can tell my wallet to pay one as many times as I want and everything works just great. I also can enter the address on blockchain.info's search box, and every transaction related to the address, and the balance of it, pops up immediately.
What is that telling me? A: Addresses starting with "1" are reusable. B: Transactions associated with them appear to be public knowledge.
Now I upgrade my wallet software and it says I now have a "reusable" address. My reaction is "Huh? Normal addresses are reusable, what's special about this weird reusable address thing that my buddy Bob's wallet software couldn't pay." I might even try to enter in a "reusable" address in blockchain.info, which won't work, and I'll just figure "must be some new unsupported thing" and move on with my life.
On the other hand, suppose my wallet says I now have "stealth address" support. I'm going to think "Huh, stealth? I guess that means privacy right? I like privacy." If I try searching for a stealth address on blockchain.info, when it doesn't work I might think twig on "Oh right! It said stealth addresses are private, so maybe the transactions are
hidden?" I might also think "Maybe this is like stealth/incognito mode in my browser? So like, there's no history being kept for others to see?" Regardless, I'm going to be thinking "well I hear scary stuff about Bitcoin privacy, and this stealth thing sounds like it's gonna help, so I should learn more about that"
Finally keep in mind that stealth addresses have had a tonne of very fast, and very wide reaching PR. The name is in the public consciousness already, and trying to change it now just because of vague bad associations is going to throw away the momentum of that good PR and slow down adoption. Last night I was at the Toronto Bitcoin Meetup and I based on conversations there with people there, technical and
non-technical, almost everyone had heard about them and almost everyone seemed to understand the basic idea of why they were a good thing. That just wouldn't have happened with a name that tried to hide what stealth addresses were for, and by changing the name now we risk people not making the connection when wallet software gets upgraded to support them.

That's not the issue; the issue is merge-mined sidechains make *mining* more expensive because it has higher overheads. P2Pool is already has an uphill battle due to higher overhead; large scale merge-mining makes the problem much worse.


Nope. GBT only does that if the GBT miners can validate, and merge-mined sidechains makes full validation significantly more expensive.

So in a merkle tree each node is H(left | right), with H being some hash function, and | being the concatenation operation.
In a merkle sum tree we add summation as well, so each node is now H(left | right | left-value + right-value), with the exception of the bottom nodes which are just H(account-id | account balance) Since the values are included a merkle path from your balance to the root published value is giving you a proof that at least your funds were included in the balance; if everyone checks the proof you know that all funds were included.
The next more sophisticated thing to do is to take the hash of the tree and generate a bitcoin address from it deterministically with ECC derivation; Timo Hanke's [pay-to-contract]( works here. Now what you've done is taken a specific set of Bitcoin funds and "allocated" them to accounts in a cryptographically provable way. Customers can then always see that their funds are backed 100% by actual funds on the blockchain through one or more proofs that in total amount to their entire account balance. This also means you don't need to publish the total amount of funds held by your service; all your customers would have to collude to determine that.
It would be great if a BIP was made of this concept, along with libraries to generate these proofs, and standards so that the proofs generated could be easily checked by third-parties. I'd be willing to do some consulting on getting this implemented, email me at pete

You don't need to publish the tree at all; you just need a button labeled "download proof-of-funds" in the UI that spits out some file letting the user prove just their account balance. No-one other than that use needs to be able to get that proof. Verifying it can be done client side with a small utility. (or with client-side javascript)
Easiest is one-time and only for cold-storage, but you can make the scheme recalculate, really re-allocate, funds as they get moved around in the wallet.

That's completely wrong. Checkpoints only exist because the current block downloading code is succeptable to DoS attacks. That code will be fixed eventually and checkpoints will be removed.
Even with them a 51% attacker can rewrite any number of blocks up to the last checkpoint - the default clients *will* accept rewrites of any length and the fact that they do is very important - the March fork would have been an even bigger problem if that wasn't true.
Like it or not, 51% attacks are just a fact of life in crypto-currencies - proof-of-work and proof-of-stake - and there isn't really anything you can do about it. It's not unlike the fact that in a democracy a 51% majority can vote in bad people; if you want to be decentralized you have to accept the 51% attack will be possible.

Furthermore it's quite easy for this "attack" to essentially happen by accident given a blocksize increase; the large miner just keeps on turning up their blocksize until they see an orphan or two, while meanwhile those with less hashing power are suffering orphans much sooner, and have every reason to move their hashing power to the larger pools.

That I have; you might even [know some of them](


I'm wondering about that... just creating artifical drama around someone can be enough to shift public perceptions of them negatively. It is after all hard to pin the origin of that trolling on any specific person, which means the "making themselves look stupid" objection to it doesn't apply.


The situation is really simple: I wrote the patch for Bitcoin, I suggested that rebase it to Bitcoin master to familiarize himself with it and the code in question. (and of course to ensure there would be another set of yes on the code) While going through that process he realized that design changes to the consensus critical code had been made that meant the patch wouldn't *mechanically rebase* cleanly. So he explored it on Viacoin - which has been following Bitcoin master on nearly an up-to-date basis and has 1:1 code compatibility - to see how the patch could be rebased. Again, Viacoin wasn't carrying this patch before - I could have just as easily posted to bitcoin-development saying "Hey! I'm not sure all these changes are a good thing." - but I thought giving some context by referring to a specific case where it caused an would be useful. I'm rather annoying that's being used as the basis of yet another silly Bitcoin-vs-alts argument.
There's no pull-req against Bitcoin Core yet because our plan was to add enabling it as a command line option - not as a softfork yet - so potential CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY users could easily test their code and try out applications using the feature. I just haven't gotten a chance to write that. You'll note that I was trying to *avoid* controversy by not making BIP65 a pull-req right away back when I proposed the feature, as I wanted to set the right tone that it wasn't to be a feature I was trying to get adopted quickly, and I wanted it to go through a proper period of review.
And stop trying to imply I'm not supporting work towards a consensus library. Hell, as far as I know I was the first person to suggest the idea in the first place and argued for it quite strongly as a way to decentralize and depoliticise Bitcoin Core development. My post to bitcoin-development quite clearly supported it and suggested a less risky way to implement one than the approach being taken that I think would better balance benefits and risks. (make life initially harder for the small number consensus lib users in exchange for significantly less risk to Bitcoin Core users)

Good question! I used to think inflation would definitely work, but then I realized that any decentralized currency system can be replaced with embedded consensus systems built on top of it, and those systems will have a market advantage if they don't include inflation. Of course, there's engineering problems to be solved, but who wants to base the security of a system on whether or not an engineering problem can be solved?
My thinking with treechains is that *hopefully* having many users of a secure publishing service will result in "enough" security, but ultimately this is an open question that we don't currently have a good answer for.

Actually, I tweeted to IIRC Android Wallet and blockchain.info with similar tweets, neither of which resulted in any drama. The former is fixing the issue. The reasons why the issue exists in Android Wallet are pretty reasonable, if not indicative of the maintainer having a lot of spare time. (they've been told repeatedly too) But I'm not going to criticise a volunteer for that and I personally wouldn't put it high on my priority list either. I probably could have stuck to a personal email w/ Android Wallet, but the fact that they're behind on little issues like that is probably something that should be public - not a big deal, but worth taking into account if you're deciding what wallet to use.
I think the main thing here was I was quite happy to give my frank and honest assessment of the situation, which was that I didn't trust Coinbase and this issue - and why it existed - was just one part of many. You'll note that Circle didn't choose to make a big deal out of my eqaully frank assessment - I use them but don't trust them with my privacy. Throw in an opportunity to claim bias and there you go.

It may be reasonable to not *count* mouse movements less than 40ms apart for the purpose of determining if you have enough entropy. But don't *discard* those movements - in a cryptographically secure PRNG adding any data to it can only help, not hurt, so you're actually throwing away a potential source of valuable entropy by doing so.
The only reason not to include that data would be if the algorithm was slow, but JavaScript can do cryptographic hash functions pretty quickly these days.

Bitcoin is *not* an efficient payment system. It replaces what could be a single centrally managed datacenter with a vast army of miners turning electricity into heat, and thousands of copies of the central ledger. That's why the cost per transaction from the inflation subsidy is curently $30USD. The one thing Bitcoin has going for it compared to existing systems is freedom from regulation, and it pays a heavy price to get that.

If recursive zk-SNARKS pan out, then validating funds sent to you is something that can be done in a few tenths of a second and a few hundred bytes of data even on a phone. Sending funds to someone else takes significant computational power, but that computation can be outsourced to a third party in a trust-free way.
If they don't pan out, then worst case you use the linearized coin history proofs, something I came up with a while back for colored coins. They scale by O(n) roughly, where n is approximately the age of the coin. The idea there is that you can use the blockchain as a random beacon, then select which input to a transaction you are going to prove the history of. Do the math on this and you'll find that while some of the time you'll get away with creating fake coins, that's balanced by the fact that the rest of the time you'll get caught in your fraud and destroy real coins, and the net expected return on fraud is then zero. With demurrage the history can even be pruned as at some point the cost to create fake coins is more than their worth due to the demurrage, which gives you O(1) scaling, albeit with a fairly high k.
I've done some numbers, and without zk-SNARKS it's plausible that receiving funds would require receiving a few megabytes of data. Not as good as Bitcoin right now for sure, but that's not a deal breaker either even on mobile.

re: SPV, remember my thinking is the solution to that is to be clever about how to manage proofs, to turn what would otherwise be "full node" requirements to "SPV-like", but with actual verification rather than just trust.
e.g. the colored coin library I'm working on simply takes advantage of the fact that the issuer is trusted, so they can be used to shorten proofs periodically. It's the dumbest, simpliest, way of doing it... but when a simple solution works use it!
Equally with better math and better approaches far more sophisticated approaches are possible too.

That's why you need geographically distinct auditing nodes! You can always prove someone is close to you by latency measurement; you can't prove they're far away from you. Thus if I want to there are two copies of data, I'll need two auditing nodes on either side of the planet.

There's two aspects to this: technology and politics.
With regard to the first there is a whole variety of anti-censorship technology available to embedded consensus systems to defeat censorship. In short, you want your transactions to look like any other Bitcoin transaction, in the same way that those same devs advise you not to reuse addresses. Adopting some of that tech is fairly easy for Counterparty; other's not so easy.
The political side of this is interesting: one even minimal anti-censorship technology is deployed you force mining pools to explicitly and actively blacklist Counterparty transactions. Obviously doing that has political ramifications, and to date the only mining pool willing to use blacklists appears to be Eligius. In addition other technical measures that make embedded consensus systems more expensive to use, like reducing/eliminating OP_RETURN and bare multisig outputs, have an inherent conflict of interest now that so many of the Bitcoin Core devs are working for Blockstream. In short, those Bitcoin Core devs would be making technical decisions that happen to harm the competitiors of the company paying their salaries. It'll be interesting to see how willing they are to do that, and to what degree the Bitcoin community accepts that.

If they "gang up on each other" via reorganizations it costs those miners a lot of lost profits that could have been used to mine blocks. What is different is with your proposed change they can gang up on each other for free, and they have a voting mechanism to easily co-ordinate that action.

Yes, and if you do that it's actually just a BIP32+nonce pubkey derivation, which is a mechanism that's been proposed many times before!
Which is worth thinking about: stealth addresses are a small, incremental improvement over existing ideas. They're just a reasonable clever way of using the blockchain as an exceptionally reliable communications channel - in the sense that the transaction either will or will not go through and funds will never end up in limbo - that replaces less reliable alternatives.

It's actually a system for reliably *detecting* censorship with [proof-of-publication]( Though as a side-effect it is reasonably censorship resistant as you can make your data look like a financial transaction, and censoring financial transactions is harmful to the value of the system.

1) P2Pool is better than that, as multiple shares are summed together across the last few thousand blocks. It's a significantly better variance reduction than just having a shorter block interval. Anyway, I was simplifying a bit for the sake of a semi-technical writeup.
2) The choice is between ASICs and *commodity* hardware. If that commodity hardware happens to be only made by a single company that's ok, so long as it's main usage isn't Bitcoin mining. After all, IC fabrication itself is an incredibly centralized industry with less than a half-dozen major players at most and absent a major technological breakthrough always will be. But anyway, the closest thing to what we want might be some kind of PoW targetting FPGAs and/or memory, and both appear to have serious flaws re: ASIC resistance.

No it won't - that's usability issue  IMO.
Third-party services have cropped up to [automate the process of finding those trust paths]( but access to those services needs to be integrated into GnuPG itself. (you use said services by finding a path, importing the required keys in GnuPG, and letting GnuPG figure out if everything is ok; they are not a trusted third-party when used correctly)
Once basics like that are implemented decentralized/distributed versions of the above can be created later.

Note that Mastercoin clients don't have to download the *whole* blockchain because each Mastercoin transaction sends a token amount - the minimum amount possible to send in a standard transaction - to the Mastercoin exodus address. In effect the consensus domain for Mastercoin transaction is (currently) "all of Mastercoin". Colored Coins restricts that domain even further to "one single color", or even "one path back to a genesis transaction for a color". On the other hand the tradeoff is that more advanced features can't be implemented with colored coins; whether or not the market requires those features and whether or not they are worth the increased bandwidth required to come to consensus remains to be seen. Personally I'm happy that we have projects exploring both avenues.
The underlying idea behind Mastercoin can certainly support Bitcoin contract mechanisms like dispute mediation, escrow, etc. although such support doesn't exist yet. One early goal of mine will be to get Mastercoin supporting P2SH addresses - the specification didn't include that initially, so the plan is to release a version without that support, followed by a version with. This will make for a good test of the embedded consensus system upgrade procedure I recently [posted]( to the bitcoin-development emial list.

Actually legally speaking insider trading is usually also defined as making a trade and not telling the investment public. Nothing stops you from making the trade itself when you want too, nor are you required to inform in advance.

@_date: 2014-07-28 09:18:02
Correct. Bitcoinj is vulnerable to Sybil attacks in multiple ways, bloom filters currently, and soon fee estimation and UTXO queries, so using Tor makes it harder to be attacked by requiring the attacker to control a supermajority of exit nodes. In that context running a really high bandwidth exit node for bitcoin users makes a lot of sense. 
Having said that, Gregory Maxwell has confirmed that this node appears to be Sybil attacking the network. So that explanation is ruled out.

Nah, the protocols with refund transactions don't work that way: the amount of "stuff" in the blockchain is exactly the same in both cases.

(Merge)-mined sidechains have some really ugly security issues; your funds can be stolen in a reorg attack. Embedded consensus systems like counterparty are as secure as the Bitcoin blockchain. (edit: might be fair to say "nearly" as secure - there's a few edge cases re: censorship and maintaining consensus is a very hard software engineering challenge)


There's a lot of stuff that's better done with the much simpler colored coin technology, but equally, there's a lot of stuff colored coins just can't do for technical reasons. In short, if you want to play around with Ethereum-style smart contracts in a decentralized system, you need a token of value like XCP.
That said, who knows if there will be social consensus one day to fork XCP and base the same codebase on yet another token of value; I just don't know the answer to that question.

You know, talking to you is like talking to a brick wall; unlike everyone else in this space it's really hard to think of cases where your opinions on things have changed in response to new evidence or ideas. This makes for a annoying argumentation style, and causes people to just drop out of conversations with you. (see my comment to Mike re: his opposition to soft-forks "[Silence doesn't necessarily indicate agreement]( The above is a great example where I and others responded to you at length, and you're repeating a very weak argument out of context. I also don't think you understand Bitcoin very well, and takes you a long time to see flaws that most others on the dev team see immediately, if you see them at all. (e.g. that fee estimation exploit, or even the [discussion]( about transaction nVersion and the CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY upgrade) It's much more satisfying talking to people who grasp complex ideas quickly and can respond with ideas you hadn't thought of, or at least know they're still learning. All of the above is pretty much just as true with Mike too.
Anyway, right now I'm now in a weird position: half my projects/paying-clients benefit hugely from cheap transactions and the other half benefit if Bitcoin fails and the world moves on to fundementally scalable blockchain systems.

Unfortunately scaling Tor up isn't as interesting as it sounds; you really need to ensure that you can use any available anti-censorship technology in multiple varieties of fallbacks.
All that tech fundementally has issues where the limitations on getting data around anonymously have very little to do with technology. For instance steganography is perfectly viable, and bandwidth for that certainly doesn't grow exponentially. (only so many cat videos a person can reasonably watch!) Radio/mesh-networking is another example, growth constrained by physics.

I won't lie - it does worry me. But mining becoming regulated as a means to make zeroconf secure worries me far more - you can't build a decentralized system on top of a centralized one. Equally mining may become more centralized as large pools can offer secure confirmations as a service, something small pools can't.
Replace-by-fee scorched-earth is one possible decentralized alternative. I'm pretty happy with the [most recent]( iteration of the idea, which can handle imperfect network propagation, at least statisticly. I need to sit down for a day and actually implement a quick demo of it...
Fidelity bonds is another much older idea, in fact, my [very first post]( to the bitcoin-development email list. (though back then I called them trusted identities) They can be used in conjunction with replace-by-fee scorched-earth too, and with a future soft-fork a proof-of-double-spend could even be used to reimburse the person who got ripped off. Again, they're a fully decentralized solution.

Thanks! I agree with you 100% on the sidechains as well. I think this validates my approach to treechains too: develop/research the tech separately from Bitcoin Core in the public sphere without speculating prematurely on how the tech should be integrated into Bitcoin Core, if at all.
As for what the Bitcoin Core developers are doing right: working towards creating a "core consensus" library is a great move. It makes it clear what code in the Bitcoin Core codebase defines what the Bitcoin protocol is, and conversely, what code is simply policy that can be chosen at will. It'll make it easier and safer for groups to fork that codebase and advocate different policies as well as technologies surrounding Bitcoin - true decentralization.
Similarly the large amount of work that's been done towards better protocol testing like the scripting system unittests - what's actually been my main contribution to the Bitcoin Core codebase - is very politically neutral work as it simply better documents how the protocol works and helps detect accidental (or delibrate!) changes to that protocol.

Well to set the record straight Mike Hearn's Lighthouse is an idea that can be implemented in a completely decentralized way.

Gregory Maxwell and I had a discussion awhile back about using block withholding attacks to combat big pools. We didn't bother going into the in-depth math - we took it from the perspective of encouraging individual users to launch these attacks - and we soon realised the end result would be a disaster that would actually make pools *bigger* rather than smaller. So we agreed not to publish the idea.
The problem is these attacks are actually quite possible to defend against, for instance by requiring miners to provide their real identity. This can be easily done, for instance with a facebook logon. Small pools can't easily do those kinds of Sybil attacks, yet they're still vulnerable to people with more resources who can, so the end result gives big advantages to larger pools and large solo mining operations. (IE the extremely harmful hosted mining like CEX.io) There's also a lot of subtle ways to detect block withholding attacks - ways that the authors of this paper aren't aware of because they're kept jealously secret. Again those detection techniques favor big pools with the ability to hire experts that small pools can't afford. (I was actually in Cornell yesterday discussing this stuff with them in person)
Remember that the pool with the biggest fundamental vulnerability to block withholding is the one that's the most decentralised: p2pool.
tl;dr: The paper is a nice bit of math and game theory, but it's got zero, even negative, relevance to the real world because of considerations the authors haven't taken into account. Also, were going to have to fix block withholding attacks - possible with a hard-fork - if people start exploiting them.
@_date: 2014-06-10 08:22:01
Because it doesn't obscure the source of the money, only the identity associated with that source. Once funds have been identified for inclusion on a blacklist the people affected are small in number, making it quite practical to apply blacklists with merge avoidance. With CoinJoin applying a blacklist will affect hundreds of people, completely impractical to enforce.

Yeah, that merge caught people off-guard - there was a bunch of IRC discussion about how it made it easy to use the UTXO set as file storage, which I summarized here: 
Mike's [response]( to that concern included the idea that "the community" would "just" decide to delete UTXOs - that is freeze funds - by creating a chain fork. Not the first time he's suggesting freezing funds; I think he's being a bit tone deaf here...
I actually ACKed the patch myself, although now that code quality issues are being brought up in addition to the problems with the design itself, I'm kinda regretting doing that. Lesson learned on my part.

This is absolutely a function of anonymity: if authorities know you own coins, they can throw you in jail until you give them up.
The scary thing is that without anonymity - with the current semi-privacy Bitcoin offers right now - said authorities can easily think you have access to coins when you really don't, and you may end up in jail indefinitely trying to fight a contempt of court charge. See: [Lawyer Freed After Longest-Ever Term for Contempt](
Bitcoin without the option of anonymity is a potentially dangerous system to use.

Exactly my point. To the extent that orphans matter I'll expect miners to move not to p2pool, but to professionally run centralized pools that can go to even greater lengths to push orphan rates down. Or worse, hosted hardware. After all I know for a fact of at least one large player who is building infrastructure to peer with a large fraction of the relay network simultaneously at high bandwidth/low latency just to push their orphan rate down, among other things.

Block reorganizations are probabalistic; large numbers of blocks being reorganized is increasingly unlikely as the number of blocks you're talking about goes up. "Bitcoin history is immutable" is a perfectly valid statement and those telling you otherwise are being rather pedantic.
Unfortunately this stuff has gotten highly political, with a big chunk of the Bitcoin realm apparently not wanting to admit that if this stuff is "abuse", then Bitcoin has a serious problem that needs to be fixed with something other than getting angry on reddit. Personally I don't try to get moralistic about this, and strongly suspect the only way Bitcoin will be secure in the long run is if lots of different services use it for publication for lots of different reasons.

I've done that before actually; the doublespend.py script linked above has a few options to get transactions discouraged by certain mining pools. For instance I've succesfully double-spent in the past with transactions that also payed to the "correct horse" address, which Eligius (and some other pools) reject from their mempools. Similarly you could just use OP_RETURN, which isn't considered valid by pre-0.9 nodes.

If writing custom nodes that behave differently is a success, the existing standard is probably not very robust against attackers.

Equally, the extra 2% of something of income that Namecoin brings in is income small miners aren't productively earning, which leads to them having an incentive to move to larger pools that can afford the overhead of mining Namecoin - and that's *just one* merge-mined chain. Already we see GHash.IO mining three merge-mined chains, and that often being cited as a reason to mine them rather than a smaller pool.

Last I checked Wladimir J. van der Laan and Pieter Wuille both agreed there's no way CLTV was going to get into v0.10.0, simple as that. Remember that when CLTV was proposed we were expecting v0.10.0 to be released "any time soon"
I personally aren't going to risk my reputation on a insufficiently tested patch, so I'm quite happy to let it take the time it needs to for us to be sure CLTV is the right solution. If you think waiting for more peer review beyond "cool feature!" is "holding things up", well, your loss.
As for hating on Viacoin... I don't see the Bitcoin community ponying up the cash to get CLTV implemented - I've billed Viacoin something like $3k for CLTV already. Before you be an asshole about something you're getting for free, you could start by paying for it. [Donations accepted](

I think you should assume p2pool as-implemented. :) Besides, it should be pretty easy to calculate the actual variance based on some amount of hashing power; seems like it must be far better than the 20x the 30s p2pool sharechain interval would suggest based on my actual experience.
@_date: 2014-01-14 21:27:10
Oh absolutely. But it has to be more than just secure and anonymous, it has to be *reliable* or funds will get lost.
Amir Taaki and I discussed using Bitmessage as that communications channel, but given there's money involved we eventually decided it'd be safer to use the stealth address mechanism instead. Of course, that doesn't stop you from also using a communication layer in conjunction, which can be useful to transmit additional metadata, and like you suggest, save the recipient some CPU and bandwidth.
@_date: 2014-01-14 20:07:38

Actually, I'm pretty confident that [replace-by-fee scorched-earth]( will make it reasonable to accept zero-conf for applications where you can accept making it economically unprofitable, rather than impossible; at the very least it won't make things worse.


That said right now I'm actually focusing on getting a colored coin library/standard done for a client. The problem I'm solving - proving colored coins are real - is very closely related to the problem of proving that coins on a treechains system are real; it'll be possible to resuse the code for treechains in the future. This does mean my treechains "core" work is on hold for a bit, but I wouldn't call it much of a delay, rather it's preparation for that "core" work.
@_date: 2014-08-20 15:56:10
That's also incorrect. Treechains splits up the blockchain, so what would be a "full node" in Bitcoin is significantly less resource intensive in treechains. Best case is with ZKSNARKS giving someone money would require sending them just a few KB worth of data.
But remember, this is a *research* project, not a fully fleshed out idea, so we'll see how things go.

@_date: 2014-08-15 07:47:44
In the big picture my treechains work is in part driven by the desire to decentralize changes to the protocol - making new developments to the Bitcoin protocol shouldn't be a long, arduous process of getting consensus from everyone if you want your ideas to be secure. Similar motivations are behind sidechains, although I think much of their approach doesn't offer real security, and will increase mining centralization. That said, much of their approach is perfectly fine, indeed, even ideas I've proposed myself.
Secondly, keep in mind that the Bitcoin *Core* codebase is actually really small, and simply doesn't need a big team of developers making modifications. What we do need is a much bigger community of researchers figuring out what modifications to the core protocol might actually make sense; right now we just don't know where the Bitcoin protocol needs to go in the future.

Who cares if they did? It's your responsibility to write code without fairly obvious DoS attacks like that. Also, knock off the personal attacks please.

I think this says it all about Mike's way of thinking.
You know, we already have what are really good mainstream systems that meet most peoples' needs: PayPal, credit cards, etc. For easily 90% of what people need they work really well, and for a lot of fundemental reasons centralized, regulated, systems best serve those needs. But the remaining 10% is a huge market that isn't being served at all.
In the rush to achieve "mainstream success" - to capture that 90% - we run a huge risk of wrecking what makes Bitcoin attractive for that 10%, while still not being able to compete with those highly efficient 90% solution systems. A Bitcoin that doesn't have good privacy and fungibility - a Bitcoin that's implemented blacklists, given miners the ability to censor transactions, and compromised on privacy in the name of "abuse" - is just a really expensive version of conventional banking and frankly won't be able to compete with PayPal, Visa, Mastercard etc. for anyone's needs.
I want to live in a world with a whole spectrum of options for how I conduct my finances, because I want the best of both worlds. Compromising Bitcoin's values in the name of "mainstream success" will give me a world with one option: the mainstream.

Like Bitcoin mining itself, the product being sold is decentralization. If I'm unknowingly buying all my storage from Google when I thought I was buying it from multiple, distinct, redundent, providers I'm getting ripped off. When I'm buying storage from centralized providers being sure I know what I'm buying is relatively easy; getting what I'm paying for in a decentralized system is a very hard problem.
That said with all this stuff if the goal is *only* to provide data on demand - without trying to make promises about reliability - then the problem is certainly a solvable one and may make for an interesting project.

One of the things I like about this explanation of Bitcoin is it cuts away all the magic: it's just [publishing data]( in a provable and trustworthy way, and that data only is meaningful because we validate it. (why you should run a full node for yourself!) It also ties the blockchain to speech: censoring or otherwise trying to control the blockchain is an attempt to censor speech.

re: sidechains, the 51% attack is relative to the merge-mined *sidechain* - a small chain that hasn't gained traction yet might have, say, 1% hashing power, in which case a &gt;1% pool is enough to attack it and take all the coins.

Don't get too excited; nothing stopping the next round from adding that again, particularly because the logic of not keeping those records is based on difficulty, not principles. If automated ways of keeping that data are developed to tie KYC info to wallet transactions the regulations will/will be changed to require you to use those "cheap and easy" anti-privacy technologies.
edit: In case this isn't clear enough: a much bigger win would have been for the discussion to be about why keeping identity records is anti-freedom; instead we got "it's hard, so lets not require it". If you want to keep Bitcoin unregulated and keep it possible to transaction privately we'll have to keep fighting politically and technically.

Lol, this is the first I'm hearing of that feature - I am after all an advisor, not a CoinKite developer.
Anyway, the language "can't" is too strong, but the feature is a decent idea given that spending unconfirmed outputs and handling all cases correctly is surprisingly complex. (Bitcoin Core does *not* handling all cases correctly) It also reduces privacy by making it more clear who owned what coins, it's incompatible with many schemes that aim to make accepting zeroconf transactions less dangerous, and it makes transaction propagation less reliable. Finally in the future there's a number of scalability improvements that are either much harder to implement, or even impossible to implement, if you can respend a txout in the same block. Just splitting UTXO's instead is a good and conservative engineering decision. I suggested to the Dark Wallet team that they do that as well to keep the complexity of the wallet code down for now. With Dark Wallet those splits can also be used to give more privacy in conjunction with CoinJoin.
edit: add more examples

That's exactly what I did. I picked 1% because its a number small enough that if miners adopted it them doing so would reveal a lot about their psychology. That experiment went on for a bit over a week and I got three double spends. Two might have been poor network propagation, and one looked like it might be a replace-by-fee miner. The funds for the experiment came from a gambling site that had had issues with double spending and was interested in maybe doing replace-by-fee scorched earth as a defense.

I think in the case of Mycelium Local Trader-style transactions it fits closely enough into how people actually use it to be ok. Remember that the amount you lock can be exact - change can happen in a separate transaction. Secondly the metaphore to use to explain it to users is to basically say that their funds are being "reserved" by being placed into a two key lockbox, it takes some amount of time before the network processes the reservation, and finally there's a timer that automatically unlocks the reserved funds no matter what.
I'm not going to say it's a truly general case thing, but I do think it's a good fit for Local Trader for sure. Anyway, like I said, you can use the idea in conjunction with a regular third-party escrow purely as a way to prevent that escrow becoming unavailable from locking your funds.

As Darkwallet's Chief Scientist, I'll tell you to use Darkwallet with money you can afford to lose. For me personally I feel comfortable trusting around ~$1k to it, but I know if that money became unvailable due to a bug, I have the skills to fix it manually. If that money was lost permanently, I'd swear a bit and shrug it off - losng $1k isn't a disaster for me personally. For most people $100 might be that threshold; for almost everyone $10 is.
I'll also say that we've never had a bug where money was *permanently* lost on Darkwallet, though we have had the occasional bug in the past where coins were temporarily lost until the user did a manual rescan of their wallet.
@_date: 2014-06-14 14:08:22
You know, a good way to compare this against the existing "defacto" zeroconf security is to think in terms of trust. With the existing scheme you have to trust *everyone* to follow the protocol, even when it's against their best interests, and *anyone* who "defects" can do you a lot of harm. It's a very fragile mechanism even in theory; in practice there are *many* real-world reliability issues that make zeroconf terribly insecure right now.
With GreenAddress's instant confirmation scheme you're just trusting a small number of entities not to attack you, entities that you voluntarily choose to trust. That's a much better situation to be in and is a promise that is practical to back up with real world enforcement mechanisms. Importantly participation in those enforcement mechanisms is your choice and does not need to involve the rest of the Bitcoin community.
@_date: 2014-06-07 01:09:46
I'm currently in email discussions with a on-chain betting site, and a physical ATM operator, both of which have been burned by accepting zeroconf transactions. Both are being forced to implement countermeasures. Equally others in both spaces have learned those lessons long ago.
Obviously in many cases the countermeasures need not be within Bitcoin, but their experience definitely has been that zeroconf just isn't very secure.

tl;dr: O(1) block propagation isn't in the face of an adversary.
Unfortunately IBLT only works for scalability if all the participants are "honest" and run the algorithm as-is, rather than try to maximize revenue. The problem is still large miners: if I'm a big miner like GHash.IO, I can earn more revenue than my competitors by including transactions that they don't yet have, which pushes their orphan rate up much more than it does mine. The miner will take a hit on subsidy profit temporarily, but their competitors take a much bigger hit.(1) In the future if transaction fees dominate revenue even that won't be true: you'll earn more money outright because you get a higher % of the transactions.
One of the more disturbing things to come out of the GHash.IO "51% attack risk" meeting a few weeks ago was that GHash.IO runs their pool at a significant loss. They don't charge any fees, so they get no direct revenue from the pool at all, yet the idea of making their pool any smaller was something they argued strongly against. Where do they make their revenue? Well, they operate an exchange, which the pool drives customers too, and they've hinted at offering "value-added" mining services - things like tx confirmation guarantees that only large pools can offer. In an environment like that it's easy to see why a pool would take a temporary loss to gain market share at the expense of their smaller competitors.
Of course, that's not even getting into the *many* unsolved problems in Gavin's scalability calculations. For instance, if I'm running flat out on my home connection just to keep up, how am I supposed to catch up and verify history properly when I start my node for the first time? How can I resist government regulation of mining if my pool can't mine over Tor? Low resource requirements are part of Bitcoin's "honeybadger" resilience; sacrificing that resilience isn't something we should take lightly.
1) And actually, the current Bitcoin protocol is flawed in that you can mine blocks without bothering to validate the previous ones; a profit-driven miner can take advantage of IBLT to quickly figure out what mempool transactions might be spent, create blocks guaranteed to not be invalid on that basis, and never even bother to check what the previous blocks contents actually were. We're going to have to fix this.
edit: make it more clear we're talking about scalability here, not IBLT, which is by itself a perfectly good idea and should be implemented. (p2pool implemented something very similar years ago)
@_date: 2014-02-17 19:06:22
That's why I said *syncing wallets* specifically; I know very well that payment protocols potentially offer another solution. Remember that those protocols don't exist yet and malleability forces you to sync wallets against blockchain data anyway.
Since it's easy to detect and prove omissions with challenge protocols at worst the mastercoin community just needs to setup some specialized full nodes to provide indexes for mastercoin transactions. That same technology would be useful for SPV clients for other purposes. (until miner-committed indexes are rolled out) For instance decentralized exchange applications with [2-step transfer]( protocols could find this technology useful for SPV client wanting to do decentralized exchange. (and of course regular bitcoin wallets!)
There's more than one way to solve this problem.

That I can't change what transaction fee Android Bitcoin Wallet uses is one of the biggest reasons why I don't use it. If I'm sending anything over a dollar or two, a few cents in fees is utterly trivial and I'd much rather pay it and get priority over others' less important transactions than risk delaying a payment.
I charge clients as much as $250/hr; I want to be able to participate in the auction marketplace that Bitcoin fees provides because my time is worth a lot of money.

It's a proposal to implement a blacklist mechanism where what coinbases are blacklisted is chosen by a majority hashpower vote. Now it is true that miners can currently do that via a reorg, but co-ordinating reorgs is difficult, miners have incentives to defect, and it's just plain expensive. Coinbase reallocation makes blacklisting via voting cheap, even profitable.
Sure, it might be intended for use to combat double-spends now, but it *will* get used for more than that in the future.

But selling 50% now locks in a significant amount of gains for me, and helps ensure I'll have the resources to weather the worst-case scenario and keep working on Bitcoin - smart investors don't get caught up second-guessing themselves.

Ugh, I hate how utterly lame this silly war between Bitcoin and altcoins is.
I quite seriously think altcoins are so weak as to be basically harmless; even if you think altcoins are an enemy of Bitcoin it's just bad PR and bad politics to make a big deal about it when they're not much of a threat. Making a big deal out of it just gives the impression Bitcoin is weak.
If you want to kill alts the right strategy is to be respectful publicly and fund the occasional 51% attack or DoS attack privately. If you don't want to do anything illegal, just stick with being respectful - resources will naturally flow towards the strongest coin due to network effects.

I visited Maidsafe a few weeks ago and left with very similar concerns. Essentially I'd describe it as the "Google Attack" where the financial incentive to offer data storage gives a company like Google the opportunity to sell nearly 100% of the capacity. Even if they have incentives to be reliable they're still a single point of failure that can go down at any moment.
The best I could come up with was to use multiple, trusted, geographically distinct auditing nodes. With the limited speed of light you can prove that more that one copy of the data is being held, although again, you can't prove the nodes aren't being run by the same organization. Similarly the auditing nodes are trusted, which means most users will be relying on centralized servers anyway.
As for the coins associated with Maidsafe and Storj, there's no reason to think any of this instant confirmations, low-fees, no-mining stuff is sybil resistant. Sure, it might work if we can rely on the majority of nodes being honest and you not being sybil attacked, but at best that's certainly a lesser standard of security than Bitcoin offers; at worst it just won't work.
@_date: 2014-06-15 20:34:57
I strongly suspect that's impossible.
Basically the issue is that while cryptography is really good at proving that statements are valid, it is not able to prove what valid statements have been made. Essentially it's the difference between just checking signatures on transactions, and solving the double-spend problem.  Treechains aims to solve that problem by just limiting where specific transaction outputs can be made - sharding the TXO set across the tree.
If bloom filters could do what you want them to do at best it'd be probabalistic anti-doublespend protection, not deterministic protection. Maybe that'd be enough, but it'd easily wind up being a design that turns out to have inflation exploits. Worth exploring further though, in the same way that while Bitcoin doesn't actually solve the byzantian generals problem, it shows that you don't actually have to to make useful digital currency.

The specification isn't finished and tested. Unfortunately something we've found with prior BIPs is that if you write a spec prior to being 99% sure the spec is correct people rush to deploy the feature, resulting in a big mess and an inability to fix things later. Equally to be perfectly honest with you, OP_RETURN's 80 byte -&gt; 40 byte reduction screwed up my original plans for the spec, and the restriction of a single OP_RETURN per tx causes a whole host of problems when using stealth in conjunction with CoinJoin, advanced blockchain applications, etc. Equally stealth addresses would work better overall if we just put the ephemeral pubkey in the scriptPubKey, keeping the logic for them the same as other address types, but the Bitcoin Core devs are against that as well. Quite frankly I've been putting off fighting that silly political battle because it's such a pain in the ass dealing with the dogmatism of the people involved.
Also I need to add some more BIP32-related features to the python-bitcoinlib library I was using to write my stealth addr reference implementation. This is something I'm happy for pay for, as I said earlier this summer on [twitter]( If you understand how [this code]( works contact me!

It's a misconception to think that Bitcoin mining isn't providing a service to others. For one thing, transaction fees are obviously a service, and secondly the purpose of Bitcoin mining even without transaction fees is to secure the network against attack. Satoshi could have just as easily assigned all 21 million Bitcoins to an unspendable address on day one, and then made mining take coins from everyone who holds them as a tax. Of course, from an economic point of view that's exactly equivalent to how Bitcoin mining works right now.
Either way it's a service and logically should be taxed as such.

This doesn't need to be an either-or thing; there's more than one type of transaction out there. For instance if Zerocoin was implemented as an appcoin it could potentially greatly reduce transaction costs by an order of magnitude for provably anonymous transactions. That's a niche Bitcoin can't currently do. If Bitcoin doesn't adopt Zerocoin technology, then both can co-exist and both can end up being valuable.

It's really simple actually: I can prove to you the coins I gave you are validly coloured by providing you with proof of the history of just those coins and no others. It's SPV with respect to Bitcoin as a whole, and full trustless client side validation with respect to your assets. In coloured coins keeping the proof size reasonable isn't a big deal as the issuer can reissue them occasionally to "reset" the coin history. Getting then proof from buyer to seller is just a matter of payment protocols.

And what do you base that statement on? It's less convenient, so obviously it's not used as much, but when you do need it it works extremely well and is very difficult to block, being an adaptive multi-method steganographic proxy. I personally know people who use it.


They're also dangerously insecure, so much so they quite literally get people killed in those oppressive countries. There's a reason why Snowden trusted Tor, not VPN's.


VPN's are even easier to block than Tor. China's Great Firewall for example automatically blocks all VPN's based on deep packet inspection - what is allowed is based on whitelists drawn up to avoid ~~annoying westerners~~ achieve political goals. (EDIT: shouldn't be so flippant) For instance if you're at a hotel with many western tourists your internet connection is often whitelisted.
It's silly to talk about adoption stats in Turkey when Turkey wasn't trying to block HotSpot Shield - if they were the service would have added exactly zero new users.

Emphasis mine.
I've spent a fair amount of time at banking/finance industry events and there is significant pressure to find ways to tie identity/KYC information to the transactions themselves in fundamental ways. This changes the impossible to very possible, and will very likely trigger record keeping all over again. This pressure comes from both regulations and the desire to make commercial use of transaction information, for instance to sell to advertisers.

I'd strongly advise you guys to formally relicense the original software as MIT with a statement signed by all the original copyright holders. If you don't do that, what OpenBazaar is doing is absolutely copyright infringement and violates the AGPL license - whethere or not you think that's a big deal is up to you, but there's no reason to dilute the meaning of the AGPL unnecessarily.
Personally I'd suggest the OpenBazaar team compromise and release it under the GPL, which is compatible with commercial software in any "internal use" or "software as a service" model. Particularly for security-related software there's very few cases where the end user wouldn't want to have the source code available, so requiring that in the license doesn't restrict sane use of the software.

I really can't see GBT making much of an impact. It's got higher bandwidth costs than stratum and only helps if people with hashing power run full nodes, which itself is relatively costly to do. Ultimately it's just a tragedy of the commons situation - you have to actually make it in miners direct short-term interests to make an impact.

That's not actually true. Bloom filters relies on trusting those random nodes and is vulnerable to a variety of attacks where those nodes lie about what addresses the filter matched. Bloom filters also have very poor privacy, essentially telling random nodes on the internet almost exactly what coins you own. When using bitcoinj with SPV and bloom filters you're vulnerable to attack by anyone who runs a DNS seed, anyone who runs a non-trivial number of Bitcoin nodes, (sybil attacking the network from the perspective of bitcoinj's SPV implementation is quite easy) and anyone who controls your internet connection. There's a lot of people, including core devs, who think Mike is pretty reckless in how bitcoinj makes use of Bloom filters, and equally, are rather annoyed at Mike for his badmouthing of safer, centralized, services like Electrum where you know exactly who you are trusting and have the ability to properly cross-reference multiple third-parties. (*not* possible with bloom filters as P2P nodes are not authenticated in any way) Incidentally, keep in mind that Electrum *is* a SPV wallet - bloom filters are just the way you get blockchain data, not the way you validate that data once you get it.
In the long run we'll see Bitcoin Core protocol changes like (U)TXO commitments that change this situation, but those protocol changes don't use bloom filters at all; relying solely on them now is quite dangerous and deploying bloom was premature.
@_date: 2014-06-25 03:08:23
Both statements are true. Bitcoin the protocol is something we should expect to change slowly and cautiously - you don't need to change it to innovate in how we use Bitcoin.
On the other hand, we simply don't know how to solve the 51% attack problem, an existential risk to Bitcoin itself. Would I like to see that fixed tomorrow? Sure, but we simply don't know yet what is the right solution. Fortunately there are a whole bunch of researchers studying the problem, and hopefully we'll have a solution before system collapses. (I'd guess there's about a 90% chance that we'll succeed there) But rushing to change things before we understand what to change would be a mistake.

From my pull-req:


Fee-sniping is a relatively "far-off" issue that we don't expect to actually see soon, but using nLockTime to prevent it costs nothing, and doing it now ensures services like Coinbase don't write broken code that prevents deploying that fix in the future.
@_date: 2014-12-09 16:29:44
The whole point of a dedicated tool is to automate it to the point where it's easy; for awhile that dedicated tool had a 95% success rate, and could have been integrated into a GUI to make it as easy as doing any other Bitcoin transactions.
Currently that dedicated tool's success rate is around 5-10%, but that's just a matter of "bitrot" that'd be easy to fix with a day or two work.

It's only now that we tried to merge CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY - I hadn't updated the patch since the BIP. (Viacoin does *not* implement CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY yet)


No-one is complaining about the end goal, just the speed at which it is happening and the risks being taken. It would have been perfectly reasonable, and a lot safer, to ship a libconsensus that stuck with bitcoind's threading and caching, spend a stable release ensuring we didn't mess that up, and work towards a better API and other internal changes.


If you want to get into debates about who should be crediting what, I'll remind you that both of us worked on that design, and since then I've spent easily two orders of magnitude more work on the nitty gritty work of writing the tests required to make CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY mergable, getting the last nits out of the design, writing the BIP, getting consensus, coming up with use-cases, talking to people who might use the feature etc. And there's way more work left to be done.
I've been quite careful to credit you in the BIP document as well as the commit message for the code I wrote. Speaking of, - it'd be appropriate to credit both gmaxwell and I in your  commit message, particularly since the code is mostly a direct copy of the patch I wrote in BIP65.

Peter Todd: Lets see if my tree chains stuff pans out first. :) If I were to compare myself to Vitalik, I'd point out he's written a lot more, both code and English, related to his "big idea"
Slush: Nope, pools existed prior to stratum and used getwork; stratum is just an incremental improvement of getwork that increases efficiency. Although IIRC slush did start the first pool and came up with the idea of pools.
Amir Taaki: ...kept saying *I* invented stealth addresses, before I corrected him that I just took some pre-existing ideas and wrote a draft spec and did some PR work to popularise it. The actual coding work has been done mainly by Pablo on the Dark Wallet team. As for CoinJoin it's Gregory Maxwells observation - he refuses to call it his invention - and I came up with the snappy name and popularised the simpliest possible way to use it, two-party mixes with value matching. Again IIRC Pablo has done most of the Dark Wallet implementation of it. What Amir Taaki should be known for is excellent leadership and drive - the guy is amazing at getting people organized to make stuff happen.
Mike Hearn: actually the micro-payment channel stuff isn't his invention. Satoshi started the work, but it took Jeremy Spilman to finally come up with a micro-payment channel design that was secure. What Satoshi designed and Mike Hearn was pushing for years - and still is - was based on zeroconf transactions, and had severe DoS issues as well.

Well remember that if you don't have a separate pubkey provided by an OP_RETURN output your privacy is reduced because the receiver now knows one of your transaction inputs. (e.g. if you're doing CoinJoin) It also means that the whole process depends on exactly what kind of scriptPubKeys your wallet uses, limiting future upgrade possibilities. It also makes hardware wallets more difficult - you might not have access to secret keys stored in them.

The original version of it where there were no safeguards and the fee estimation code would have determined if a transaction was paid too small fees to be allowed to be relayed was actually a pretty risky patch - quite a few devs thought it was too agressive to even be a 0.10 feature.

Bitcoin can add a entirely new scripting language to the system in a soft-fork if a majority of miners agree to do so. Right now that would take the co-operation of as little as two pools. (a rather damning statement on the state of decentralization in Bitcoin!)
@_date: 2014-01-15 01:48:15
If P2Pool tried to do that it'd make itself extremely vulnerable to attack from anyone broadcasting double-spends to different parts of the network simultaneously; the whole point of block-chains is to come to consensus about what transactions exist.
Also, if &gt;50% of the P2Pool hashing power is controlled by a single miner, there's no way to *enforce* that - you're asking GHash.IO to enforce something against themselves.

I've had generally good experiences before; this is the first time I've had a reporter both contact me, and write something very different from what I would have written. That said, to be clear I doubt this was a delibrate misrepresentation, just a reporter who didn't have the full picture.


Quite simply the "O(1)" block propagation proposal is O(n), not O(1). It's *really* not O(1) if miners are acting in their best self-interests rather than blindly using the codebase as written. In short, it doesn't do what Gavin thinks it does.
Having said that, miners can and probably will implement it anyway. The real danger is people thinking that the performance increase it gives when someone *isn't* trying to exploit it means you can safely increase the blocksize; the performance increase can be exploited and negated by larger miners to seriously harm smaller miners, leading to centralization.
Anyway, I'll try to get a chance to do a proper writeup on it soon, but hey, I am supposed to be [on vacation]( right now with my family for a few more days. :)

Note that none of those technologies need to be added to the Bitcoin protocol directly to be deployed. Zerocash as an example can easily and securely be implemented as an embedded consensus system via OP_RETURN and similar techniques. Zerocash would be a separate currency technically speaking, but buying and selling Zerocash would happen on the same blockchain in exchange for Bitcoins in a fully decentralized and secure way. Should the technology prove its worth it can be added to the Bitcoin protocol later, which has some technical advantages. (and disadvantages) If it doesn't, then no harm done. If the implementation needs upgrading, the only users who need to upgrade are those using that implementation of Zerocash. If there are multiple competing groups with different ideas for how Zerocash should work, they can all try out their ideas without asking permission from "core devs" or miners.
tl;dr: What Gavin, any other "core dev", or even miners think about a particular technology doesn't need stop you from implementing it, even in production.

When Amir and I looked at the problem the best we could come up with was to give the recipient a one-time nonce that would be then used to derive a BIP32 branch used for all subsequent payments. Nice idea, but made wallet support significantly more complex as you then needed lots of state.
Equally, if you go down the path of "communicate the nonce/chain-code to the recipient out-of-band" whatever mechanism you use to do that is guaranteed to be less reliable than Bitcoin itself. In short, the payment is no longer atomic and there will be edge cases where failures cause the recipient to never get it, yet the funds have left the sender's wallet.
@_date: 2014-06-13 18:47:03
I was describing what would happen on a technical level if there was a 51% attack right now. That's not at all what happens in the medium to long run, or in attacks on Bitcoin that are less blatant, which is what has me worried; note how I stressed that I was describing the *current* situation only. You can also do a lot of harm with a substantian minority of hashing power too - GHash.IO is claiming they have actual control over something like 25-35% of the total hashing power because they own the hardware. Finally seeing block withholding attacks get used is a very worrying thing, given that they can be easily used against small pools, and defending against that is very hard - I hadn't expected that.
Keep in mind, my investment strategy is obviously based on a plan and this sell criteria is simply a failsafe built into it that to work well needs to be executed without trying to make excuses not too and taking risks I shouldn't be. Is Bitcoin going to get attacked tomorrow? Probably not, but the situation is obviously much worse than it was. It's also much worse than when BTC Guild was nearly 50%, because BTC Guild didn't own actual hashing power. When this is my livelyhood I have to be more conservative than many would be around here.

Merkle trees allow parts of the material to be verified efficiently. In this case, if you verify that your account is backed by funds, you know MtGox has at least the funds representing your account. Every user that does a verification makes it harder for MtGox to lie.
Notably you do not have to publish all the material in one go publicly; as dooglus suggests the advantage is privacy as individual users only need to see the raw account data relevant to their account.
Similarly for transactions, merkle trees will allow nodes with only part of the blockchain to verify that part is self-consistent. If everyone verifies overlapping parts you get 100% coverage of the whole chain. (note that this needs (U)TXO commitments to work)

I've proposed ideas quite similar to sidechains myself before - I called them [Fidelity Bonded Ledgers]( - and the "rachetting" concept for redeeming funds by find the longest known chain is something gmaxwell and I came up with for fidelity bonded ledgers. I want to stress that **90% of the ideas in sidechains are good ideas**, and they've had a lot of peer review. I've been promoting sidechain concepts to my colored coin clients in fact, as they'd be a great way to add auditabillity and shutdown-resistance to the centralized entities that will exist to trade colored coins at high speed and low cost; the smartcolors kernel I'm working on is specifically designed to work well with sidechains and hub-and-spoke micropayment systems.
The idea of a Dynamic Membership Multi-Party Signature (DMMS) is a very clever way of describing Bitcoin's PoW in terms of a cryptographic signature; AFAIK the idea is a novel one. As an academic tool it's a great description, and I think helps make clear the issues with proof-of-stake. But would I create a production financial system using DMMS? No.
The problem is applying the DMMS signature concept to deciding history with 2-way-pegs. Basically doing that means that you have a pot of money - the 2-way-pegged funds - which can be taken by anyone with hashing power to spare. It creates a situation where 51% attacking a sidechain has a strong monetary incentive, one that even grows as more people use the sidechain. (remember this incentive may be due to lost coins too!) Fixes like re-org proofs only delay the inevitable: with sufficient hashing power 51% attackers can steal the pegged funds, and earn a lot of money doing so.
The second issue is that 2-way-pegs are most viable with merge-mining. Without merge-mining, hashing power is split among all the sidechains, leading to the poor security situation we already see in the altcoin market. (do I really need to list all the alts that have been 51% attacked?) Merge-mining is a seductive alternative - let miners secure our chain at no cost to them - but it's equally good at letting attackers attack our chain at no cost. Of course, sidechain promoters will bring up notions of 'opportunity cost' in defence, arguing that attacking the chain is not cost free because the chain can reward miners in some way. But economic rewards aren't universal: if my country doesn't let me mine Zerocash for legal reasons, the value of mining Zerocash to me is zero. If I'm invested in a sidechain that competes with Zerocash - perhaps RingSigCash - the value of mining Zerocash to me may even be negative for helping out the competition. Equally on top of that, I always have the opportunity of stealing 2-way-pegged funds, or at minimum, DoS attacking the competing chain by triggering re-org protection rules until enough miners give up mining it for me to steal the funds.
The third issue is that merge-mining promotes mining centralization. Heck, the sidechain paper says so itself, pointing out that the overhead costs of mining a sidechain make large pools more profitable than small ones, and suggests that perhaps validation could be outsourced to third-parties. For instance Blockstream could act as a central sidechain verification service that mining pools contract with, giving control of the sidechains over to the third-party... Needless to say, this is just hiding that centralization by adding a level of indirection.
Should Bitcoin adopt the soft-fork required to make (merge-)mined 2-way-pegged sidechains possible? Well, Ethereum doesn't have a choice: it's scripting system is sufficiently complete that it already supports the creation of 2-way-pegs. (I'd suggest sidechain devs look into developing the idea there!) Bitcoin may want to support 2-way-pegged sidechains that are signed by (federated) central authorities - but we're going to want to think very, very carefully how we're going to avoid the serious downsides of encouraging more merge-mining.

Keep in mind that the tech required to give treechains O(1) scaling is much of the same tech that'll get developed to try to make sidechains secure - e.g. recursive SNARKS; I think a lot of people assume there's more animosity between the two ideas than there really is. I'm sure treechains will adopt a lot of tech from sidechains.
Anyway, here's my views on the idea, copied from the other thread:

Yes, existing protocol *today* - pruning makes those attacks not work in the future, something that's been discussed repeatedly. Jeff Garzik, Gregory Maxwell, and others concerns about getutxos is that it may limit our options in the near future, given that pruning is being worked upon.


Quit with the inaccurate personal attacks. Lots of people are writing Bitcoin Core code - far more than you are - and the supermajority of that code I've been reviewing, testing, and ACKing because it's good work. It's only a very small minority of pull-reqs that I've had any opposition to at all.

No, there is actually. They just need to create a merkle sum tree of every customers balance and publish the root of that tree publicly. Doing that lets anyone easily verify that their account was included in the tree, making it possible to detect fraud on the part of Mt. Gox.
@_date: 2014-01-14 19:33:47
This isn't automating the process, this is eliminating the requirements for bi-directional communication entirely.
A good example where this is valuable is you put your stealth address on your business card and give it to me. Sometime later you call me on the phone and say "Hey! You owe me for that beer!" I can just pay you immediately right then and there with the stealth address without you needing some payment server to give me a fresh pubkey, yet the transaction is still totally private.
Similarly, you can put your stealth address as part of your OpenPGP key, and with the web-of-trust I can be be sure I'm paying the right person. Or do the same thing with a X.509 certificate.

Full nodes don't really contribute to the "health" of the network the way you think they do. Each full node is an individual entity, for instance if one full node finds an invalid block, there is no way for it to warn other nodes that the block is fraudulent. (known as a fraud proof in the academic community) They do provide more capacity for SPV, but it's not provably "honest" capacity - a full node can lie about a lot of things to an SPV client and they'll be none the wiser. For instance currently full nodes can censor transactions from SPV nodes, and there's no way for them to know that's happening if they are sybilled, and sybilling SPV nodes isn't very hard.
I think the bigger takeaway from this drop is that people find running full nodes inconvenient and expensive, in terms of bandwidth and diskspace, and it's much easier to just outsource your trust to others. Unfortunately Bitcoin currently has really awful scaling properties - everyone must know about every transaction if they don't want to outsource validation/trust to others - and that's just something we're going to have to fix in the long run.
What it really comes down to is currently your options are binary, either you do contribute as a full node and use up a bunch of diskspace and bandwidth, or you don't contribute anything at all. We need tech so that there's a gradient, so that everyone can contribute a bit of validation, a bit of mining, a bit of sharing the bandwidth and diskspace. That's going to require a fair bit of engineering effort, and it requires a blockchain structure that is a lot more flexible and non-monolithic/one-size-fits-all than what we have right now.
But hey, I'm biased: I'm working on one such project I'm calling Tree Chains, so take what I say with a grain of salt. :)
@_date: 2014-02-01 23:30:15
Well for full nodes the ideas I had in my original paper are all fine - scanning the whole blockchain for addresses isn't cheap, but for a wallet on a desktop it's not a big deal. (it's basically how Bitmessage works remember)
For SPV nodes where you want to save on bandwidth the mechanism I proposed - prefix filters - is simple, but the privacy isn't quite as good. We're still discussing ideas there.
A good project for you would be to do up the OP_RETURN style of nonce-embedding to sx and associated blockchain scanner; OP_RETURN txouts have been made standard in the upcoming 0.9 release of Bitcoin Core.

@_date: 2014-03-13 17:02:05
It doesn't, at least if you want it to stay decentralized.
However a lot of academic work has been done on scalability. One main approach is to find ways to safely do transactions off-chain, where you use a third-party to hold the funds, and hold them accountable via auditing and anti-fraud measures. What's interesting is that since the bottom layer, Bitcoin itself, is decentralized and cryptographic, you can have much stronger protections than available traditionally, even to the point where I believe you could trust anonymous third-party banks with *some* your Bitcoins, (IE your balance for small purchases) knowing that while they could take your money, they'd be guaranteed to not be able to profit by doing so. Of course I and others did a bunch of research into that last year, and gave a [talk]( at the San Jose Bitcoin conference, and instead there was not much interest in actually implementing even the simpliest auditing and MtGox happened...
The other approach - what I'm working on right now - is figuring out how to make Bitcoin scale by restructuring how the blockchain itself works so that not everything has to be made public to everyone to verify it. My Tree-Chains idea is to use essentially a binary tree in place of our blockchain, arranged such that miners would only ever mine one path from some leaf node of that tree up to the root of the tree. Difficulties go down as you go lower, with some rules to make 51% attacking part of the tree hard. Critically, it looks like you can setup reorg rules such that a miner mining another part of the tree can create transactions based on funds being spent at another part, knowing that if the first part ever gets reorganized out of existence the second transaction is also made invalid so inflation doesn't happen. (tx's are a two-phase commit essentially) There's some more details I've talked about on  I'm writing it all up in a paper and will be first presenting it at the Toronto Bitcoin Expo in April. There are other people working on similar "shard the blockchain" ideas too - it'll be interesting to see how it all plays out. Also, credit goes to Mastercoin for paying me to research this stuff; a big part of my job as their Chief Scientist is actually to improve Bitcoin itself.
What doesn't work is "just increasing the blocksize". As much as the selfish mining paper was a bit overblown, it did make clear that the incentives behind block propagation are all screwy, and big miners bizzarely have incentives for their blocks to *not* propagate to 100% of the network, among many other serious problems. It's just a classic case of an externeality where the bad actors (big miners) don't pay the costs. (validating and distributing the now huge blockchain in a decentralized way)

Yes, Amir Taaki and I discussed exactly that extensively at the Dark Wallet hackathon. However we couldn't figure out a way to do that with the same reliability as using the blockchain.
Not unprecedented anyway: the additional overhead is less per transaction than multi-factor wallets, and lots of people agree they're a good idea.

...and 95% of the time being a little more clever means you don't have to change the Bitcoin protocol anyway.
Case in point: with [PayPub]( you can use Bitcoin to pay for information in a trust-free manner with 100% standard transactions.
For that matter, you can put Ethereum directly on top of Bitcoin as an embedded consensus system right now using client-side validation - it's reasonably SPV compatible if done as a colored coin. If the Bitcoin community likes the new features and they've shown their value, then they can be incorporated into the Bitcoin protocol later via the decentralized upgrade process.

@_date: 2014-04-28 00:20:26
...and that's a single datapoint.
CoiledCoin on the other hand was merge-mined and because a bunch of hashing power didn't approve of them, Eligius, they could be 51% attacked at no cost at all. Merge-mining is a double-edged sword, and for it to be secure requires it to be used in a way that is not scalable.

The question is why does this matter? Obviously if knowing *all* unspent transactions is a requirement for your protocol, it can't have very good scaling properties. One of the main idea behind tree chains is that you shouldn't have to care what other people are using the blockchain for - all that matters is that you are receiving valid coins.


Why do you think that? Perhaps more specificly, why do you think Bitcoin doesn't suffer from the same problem?


At worst, attacks still cost money, so weaker subtrees can be used for less valuable transactions; once you've moved your funds out of a given subtree it getting attacked does you no harm because coins are proven to exist by providing history to the recipient. Additionally with regard to consensus security on timestamps unlike merge-mining with treechains all subtrees benefit from the same security level as everyone is contributing to the same top-level chain.

@_date: 2014-06-25 01:48:37
Even worse than that, detecting such an attack is impossible because the crypto hides the evidence.
@_date: 2014-02-15 20:08:05
Note that sending a fee, the minimum possible amount to send, to the devs with every transaction is a way to make Mastercoin more SPV friendly by making it easy for SPV clients to get all Mastercoin transactions and thus come to consensus. Mastercoin is also built on top of the BTC blockchain, and doesn't try to invent any new cryptography. The two projects are very similar technically.
It'll be interesting to see how development efforts shape out in the long run given the lack of funds and requirement for volunteers. Colored Coins was in a similar situation, although they've since been able to get some funding to pay developers through donations. (I myself are doing some paid work for them in addition to my work for Mastercoin as Chief Scientist)

One interesting thing about this stuff is that escrow and oracles are all examples of free speach. An oracle is implemented by me simply stating that if something happens I will publish some data, if something else happens, I'll publish another piece of data. Escrows can be implemented exactly the same way, where the "something" happening is the conditions of the escrow being met. (IE, did Alice faithfully ship a product to Bob?)
Equally the Bitcoin blockchain is at it's heart a Proof-of-Publication system. Basically it's a medium that you can *provably* publish data on. We've already got completely non-cryptographic efforts at doing this kind of thing in the form of Google's certificate transparency system. Under these new rules it is very unclear as to whether or not designing even a system not meant to be used for currency is illegal if it can be reused for a currency application, and any secure proof-of-publication scheme can be reused as a building block for currencies.
Trying to regulate this stuff now is just going to result in years of silly court battles and innovators staying out of NY.

I've been working with Alex Mizrahi on Colored Coins. There's plenty of encoding methods that make minimum transaction values irrelevant for that technology. For instance here's the most simple method that I've come up with:
    Regarding padding, it occured to me that all you actually need to do is
    just say the most significant bit in nValue that is set to 1 is padding,
    end of story. If nValue &lt; MAX_MONEY, then that bit might be followed by
    a few other zero bits, if not, then it isn't. The algorithm to apply and 
    remove padding is trivial:
    # apply padding
    assert 0 &lt; nValue &lt;= MAX_MONEY
    padding_idx = None
    for i in reversed(range(1, 62))
        if 1 &lt;&lt; i &amp; nValue:        
            padding_idx = i - 1 
        elif 1 &lt;&lt; i &amp; MIN_VALUE:
            padding_idx = i 
    nValue |= 1 &lt;&lt; padding_idx
    # remove padding
    assert 0 &lt; nValue &lt;= MAX_MONEY
    padding_idx = None
    for i in reversed(range(0, 63))
        if (nValue &gt;&gt; i) &amp; 1 != 0:  
            nValue &amp;= ~(1 &lt;&lt; i)
            break
    If you want you can also use the LSB of nValue to turn the padding
    feature on and off. At worst there will be some excess padding compared
    to the bare minimum, but the rules are very simple and easy to
    understand.

Namecoin in that regard is a step backwards, not forwards.
Gavin Andresen already has a human identity. If someone else had already gotten "gavinandresen" on Namecoin, then what? For that matter, if two people have the same name, then what? If anything, that risk encourages people *not* to use Namecoin, which makes a given name more likely to be squatters/fraudsters than the intended human identity. This is a downward spiral that leads to the system being useless.
Namecoin only makes sense when you're building your identity from scratch, but if you're doing that, then do you really need the name anyway?

I mean, the problem colored coins solves is one that could be ported directly over to treechains, modulo being able to trade Bitcoins for colored coins. (however you could still trade colored coins for different colored cons!) The actual data structures that correspond to a colored coin proof are pretty much exactly how treechains schemes will (probably!) need to work.
Incidentally, to be clear, colored coins shows how the "exponential blow up" of proofs is often a complete non-issue for a whole class of applications for which treechains is useful. A really easy to understand example of this is bitmessage, for which treechains would give a combination of strong sybil-attack detection and resistance, as well as scalability.

Keep in mind, the issue isn't that IBLT is necessarily bad, it's that it's gives a very misleading view of how scalable the network actually is. If you only added IBLT, it's not a big deal and something miners have an incentive to do anyway; if you add IBLT then go and say "Hey! Well that solved the blocksize problem, lets get rid of that silly limit" you risk doing a lot of harm to Bitcoin.

My comments only apply if you are trusting your alt-implementation to get consensus right for mining or block verification. If you're just using the alt-implementation for SPV consensus bugs aren't a big deal and have sane ways to handle them.

The main thing is that no-one is using bitcoinjs to mine with - that'd harm security for everyone.

To be blunt, I'm working for various colored coin and embedded consensus system (Mastercoin/Counterparty/etc) projects, and I'm very familiar with where the Bitcoin protocol is likely to go into the future. Quite simply it is highly unlikely that there will be changes made to the protocol that cause any of those projects significant harm. Doing so will force Bitcoin into being a system very, very, different from how Bitcoin works today.

Meni's analyse is good bit of academic math, but it doesn't take into account the much higher orphan rates and centralization pressure from faster block intervals.
Ultimately 1 minute blocks *still* aren't anywhere near good enough for retail and similar time-sensitive operations - that needs seconds at most - yet even minor changes in latency become major problems with a 1 minute block interval. Miners already put a large amount of effort into reducing the latency of their Bitcoin P2P connections, making use of special protocols like Matt Corallo's optimized block relay network; Gavin's proposing we make that problem 10x worse.
@_date: 2015-05-07 06:14:20
You're probably being sarcastic... But yes, you're absolutely right about what would happen. Unfortunately the Bitcoin protocol has very poor scaling properties and we don't yet know how to fix that directly; schemes like the Lightning network fix that by adding layers on top of Bitcoin. Centralized systems like Visa and PayPal don't have that problem.

That said, with trusted escrow+nLockTime I think pragmatically you're 95% of the way there. Yes, the agent can still help the other party steal coins in some circumstances, but the fact that they did so is easily provable, and secondly 95% of the time the failure of the agent - IE they suddenly go out of business - does no harm.
Not perfect, but good enough it's worth implementing IMO.

Like I said elsewhere, I talked to regulators in NY only a few weeks ago at the American Banker conference who thought that it'd be a good idea to apply regulations to mining pools directly; they were under the impression that all Bitcoin mining had become an industrial-scale affair, easy to track down and supervise.
Paypal tried the "everyday commerce" route, and they still wound up regulated because the underlying architecture was easy to regulate.

No he's not. He specifically wanted to do a pull-req to implement 20MB blocks for the v0.11 release in just over a week. This isn't going to happen now because of the pushback, but "just start a discussion" wasn't his original plan.

It's not the transaction that's encrypted, it's a secret nonce (a random number used only once) known only to the participants that lets the receiver derive the secret key to recover the funds. To the network it looks like any other transaction.

I use Circle frequently when I specifically want to make *non-anonymous* transactions that I know will be publicly linkable to me. Using them in that way ensures that my financial privacy of the *rest* of my Bitcoins is protected, as I always purchase Bitcoins on circle via credit card rather than transfer them to Circle. That should tell you a lot about how much I trust them with my privacy - not at all.

Nothing you've talked about lets 600 million users simultaneously run full nodes and use the Bitcoin blockchain directly - like we keep saying, the existing Bitcoin protocol has O(n^2) scaling. This is a fundamental comp-sci scalability challenge, not a usability issue.

It's worth stressing that the large surplus of extra bandwidth the average Bitcoin node has compared to the minimum needed with 1MB blocks has saved our ass on multiple occasions.
When you operate close to the limits of the tech you don't have any margin for error - not a good situation to be in when you have still relatively experimental and poorly understood tech powering a multi-billion economy.

What I think is interesting about Mike's passport idea is how much control it puts in the hands of governments. They *already* have well-oiled processes for creating fake passports and other identification documents that are used routinely for operations of all kinds, even to the point of allowing other (friendly!) countries to obtain fake passports. Any system based on proof-of-passport absolutely will find itself highly vulnerable to governments attacking it, and even worse, the crypto guarantees that you'll never even know that it's happening. For Mike to push the idea so strongly without at least making that clear is odd.
re: sybil, we do have alternatives. For instance Tor is based on the fact that it's a centralized system controlled by a small number of well known people who keep close watch on the network, in particular, how much bandwidth is being made available to the network by people they do not know. Some "unknown" bandwidth is a good thing, and helps protect everyone, but that number getting too high or too low is a cause for concern. Of course, equally Tor lets you pick who you trust to keep your anonymity secure as well - trusting the Tor team is only the default.

There's some pretty big security concerns with doing that. It's plausible that someone could create a RIPEMD-160 collission via birthday attack. In P2SH's use of it, that's not a big deal - someone just found two ways to spend their own coins. But if used with the UTXO set this is a *huge* problem: you can fork the network with no easy way to recover.

a) While it's true that treechains makes it cheaper, Bitcoin suffers from the exact same problem in principle. P2SH^2 - which isn't yet implemented and may never be - only makes it more expensive to put data in the UTXO set, nothing more.
b) ZKSNARKS can be used to replace the direct blockdata data proofs with indirect zero-knowledge proofs, thus removing the need to provide actual blockchain data in your proof. (and with recursive ZKSNARKS, making the valid coin proofs have O(1) scaling) There's some groundbreaking research coming down the pipeline for ZKSNARKS, apparently including some the sidechains group are funding. I'll be more than happy to apply the results of that research to treechains in the future.

Remember I framed it that way not because Mike was proposing that directly, but rather to show quite clearly where the proposal led to.
At the core it's just a mechanism to allow miners to reliably vote with their hashing power to blacklist things. It may be intended to be used against double-spends, but it can be used against much more than that, and if implemented, there will be significant pressure to do so on many levels.

*Eventually*, if you want to serve a decent % of the world's population, assuming there's no advances in blockchain technology between now and then.
We're nowhere near that level of adoption and raising the limit now poses serious risks. By the time we are there it's quite likely we'll replace the existing, unscalable, blockchain technology with something that genuinely does scale, making the very notion of a "blocksize limit" obsolete.

Without changing the way the protocol works, quite frankly, no.
Making it possible for a decentralized consensus layer to scale up indefinitely was my goal with treechains, but it's a pretty big change from the current way Bitcoin operates, and needs a lot more research.
@_date: 2014-10-16 15:00:29
Quick comments:
* Talking about increasing the blocksize without talking about resistance to censorship and regulation assumes that either governments won't make any attempt at regulating Bitcoin, or the regulations they do try to make will be acceptable. In particular, Gavin proposes "a reasonably good home computer and network connection can participate as a full node on the network", saying absolutely nothing about whether or not that participation can be done without making it easy to detect that you're participating in the Bitcoin network.
* The assurance contracts proposed by Mike Hearn to secure the blockchain don't work. The problem is that in an anonymous system miners can always complete the contract undetectably, so it's no longer a proper assurance contract and instead is just a random donation. Potentially worse, it's a donation to the largest miner (because of logistics and reorg attacks) thus strongly incentivising centralization. (this flaw was brought up when the idea was first proposed)
That said, it's notable that Gavin's finally accepted that there is a real danger of a centralization death spiral if blockchain growth outpaces tech, and equally, that there aren't market mechanisms to prevent that if you don't have an artifical limit at all. That's a *huge* change from his previous positions on the subject, one that Gavin deserves credit for. It also makes the discussion is a much saner one: if you're going to raise the limit, how do you decide how much to raise it and what values does the community care about?

FWIW p2pool and Matt Corallo's block relay network have both implemented a close cousin to IBLT for some time now.

Of course it'd be feasible; a no transaction per block system is feasible too...
The question is simply what exactly are they trying to prevent and allow by using a blockchain? If they want to allow trades to happen *without* NASDAQ involvement at every step, then the option of one-tx-per-trade colored coins makes a lot of sense. Quite likely they'll have a need for both systems, and many other models to boot.

I didn't actually test it myself, but I know someone who did and they said they had an easy time double-spending it - I forget what probability they said but 10-20% would be likely.

In addition to all of the above in practice many wallets have the ability to seize user funds on demand by modifying the source code and pushing an update to the user, e.g. on a website or via an auto-update capability. This was used in the case of StrongCoin to steal back stolen funds. It's easy to imagine judges considering such capabilities as being equivalent to having "control" of user funds in some situations.

Nah, Amir would love enough funds to have a paid for and stable space. It's just a matter of lack of money from a source with similar political goals.
Heck, for that matter squats are a complex topic: often they develop sufficiently good relationships with the local community and local government that they are there with permission. Similarly it's not unknown for squatters to be paying for their utilities and doing substantial renovations to the buildings they are in. (for instance in one place Amir was at the squatters, who had been there ~10years, had recently replaced much of the roof, plumbing, and electrical wiring) Hilariously that can actually cause friction with building owners if it's a protected historic building, because their incentives may be to let the building go into ruin so they can replace it with something modern, while the squatters and local community want to keep the historic building in good shape. Equally of course some squatters simply trash places - for obvious reasons that group tends not to stay around for long.

If the cost is higher than the potential payoff, then no, you can't wield that violence. Equally, when terrorism works it's *because* of the response that it provokes.
This isn't such a case: there's simply no way that these "anti-fascist" hooligans can do genuine harm to Trump. They're massively outnumbered and outgunned, which means that violence can't directly lead to victory - they just can't injure or kill enough Trump supporters to have any direct effect. Equally, the response they're going to provoke - increased security - plays right into Trump's goals of strengthening security and clamping down on dissent.


It's a rhetorical flourish, not a serious statement; obviously I mean that in addition to that nuclear football, Trump also can make use of a huge number of police and military assets that would actually be used against this type of violence, if it ever became a genuine problem (right now, it's probably helping his cause more than anything).
Of course, if these anti-fascists gained significantly more support, we'd be having a very different discussion - such a movement could one day have enough ability to wield violence to use it effectively. But I highly doubt assaulting people peacefully attending a talk will get them there. Much more likely is they'll just alienate those who might have supported them; I'm certainly personally disturbed by this.

There is no limit in Bitcoin Core on mempool size. Of course, at some point nodes run out of memory, but few if any attackers seem to be willing to spend the fees required to pull off that attack.

Yup. Basically the way you implement it is for older software to see this:
    &lt;data&gt; NOP
They just execute that - to them the script did nothing and returned true and thus blocks spending such txouts are in fact valid. But newer software interprets that data as opcodes:
    &lt;&lt;signature&gt; CHECKSIG DO_MAGIC MORE_MAGIC&gt; EVALUATE
If the opcodes for the new scripting language return true, they let the script succeed, but otherwise the script is failed and blocks with such scripts are considered invalid. So long as &gt;50% majority follows the new rules, only blocks with those rules will be in the blockchain. In practice the threshold gets set to something more like 95% to be safe.

They do.


Depends on your security assumptions; I'm assuming users of Bitcoin mostly run validating nodes with some constant %. You're assuming as Bitcoin scales up validation becomes increasingly centralised, resulting in a network where almost everyone has to trust a small number of full nodes to validate for them.
Obviously scaling the latter is a much easier problem that has been solved many times before, e.g. PayPal.

Pretty much everyone in that room agrees that raising the blocksize limit is at best a temporary hack, at worst will kill bitcoin by both centralizing it, and removing the incentive to mine. (transaction fees) Quite a bit of the conference involved discussion about how to scale up Bitcoin without touching the blocksize limit.
@_date: 2015-05-21 04:01:01
One of the interesting things coming out of the "permissioned ledger" stuff banks are looking at is that blockchains don't scale even in centralized situations. Heck, just the other day I was at a major bank talking to their IT people about how they didn't like how adopting Ripple would require them to constantly upgrade their systems to handle the world wide Ripple transaction volume - it all goes on a single shared ledger - even if their own business transaction volume wasn't growing as fast.
It's just a poor design. In the case of Bitcoin, there's good reasons why version 1.0 used a global ledger, but the only long-term way to scale up is to come up with a better, layered, architecture.

You know, at the Financial Cryptography conference a few months ago, during the Bitcoin session I was asking about 3/4ths of the good questions during the talk Q&amp;A's... but that leaves 1/4th from the academics, who were all catching on pretty quick to what Bitcoin is and how it works.

A key difference with Luke's proposal is he proposes to write - in advance - a clear way for those who want to opt-out of the HF a way to continue to use the old rules and make such software available to ensure that users of the old chain have an easy way to opt out. Luke's rational here is harm prevention: he wants to ensure that all users are forced to actively make a choice, and equally, ensure that no user is tricked into accepting a coin they didn't expect to accept.
In contrast Gavin (and others) appear to be arguing that miners should actively attack such a minority chain, even if it has users who want to use the chain, and even if the chain has switched to using a different proof-of-work. That's not harm prevention - that's actively attacking your competition.
FWIW personally I've strongly argued against Luke's proposal in private, and I'm considering making that argument a public one as well if it gets further traction, on the basis that requiring the minority chain's users to do anything to avoid being attacked has dubious ethics. I'm not alone in that view among developers either.

You know, I've never actually met a govt/regulatory/banking type person who has argued that Bitcoin should be banned; I have met plenty who argue it needs to be regulated. For instance by making it possible to freeze funds via court order, forcing transactions to have attached AML identity info, etc. Implementing these kinds of controls gets much easier as the full node count goes down, and if full node/mining pools don't have the option of operating anonymously.
It's very unclear if we can succeed in the goal of "significant" adoption given the one thing we can uniquely offer to the world is freedom from regulation.

The block *header* hash in just a number; my point is you can create a block without bothering to validate the previous one or even having the data. Only if the previous miner wasted ~$13,000 on mining an invalid block - not likely - are you going to run into trouble doing this, and you'll earn more money by reducing your orphan rate.
The problem is, if you're doing this you're weakening the security of the whole network; you're effectively cheating the intent of the Bitcoin protocol.

I'm well aware of those numbers... Like I say, adopt Lightning, let growth increase, and evaluate later. Lightning alone could scale up Bitcoin dramatically without touching the blocksize limit, and they're far from the only scaling option being used.
Remember that the March 2013 fork showed quite clearly that *with consensus* Bitcoin can be changed very rapidly; an uncontroversial, supported by evidence, blocksize limit hard fork could be rolled out in a few weeks.

As I said, unconfirmed transactions are *already* insecure enough that those same PoS systems are vulnerable anyway.

Only in Bitcoin would "I think we should have a variety of financial options, including credit cards, Paypal, and a Bitcoin with good privacy, and I think all those options can be complementary" be considered "black and white" thinking.
Anyway, I am expressing my opinion openly, so is Mike. What's the issue? "rational debate" includes debate about the principles behind decisions. And "rational debate" certainly should include arguments that you believe certain approaches will lead to disaster.
I'd hate to live near a nuclear power plant where every time anyone pointed out "Hey! I think we really need to fix this positive void coefficient is or we're going to have a meltdown one day." was shouted down as "black and white" thinking.

It's pretty clear that forcing the Bitcoin protocol to change to implement AML and blacklisting of funds is a long-term goal of governments, including the US; by that standard the US government is an oppressive regime. The mechanism by which you force a change like that in a decentralized system is pressuring mining pools.
Being able to say to regulators that pressure will simple cause pools to leave regulated jurisdictions is valuable, but there actually aren't that many jurisdictions out there that aren't oppressive in that sense; the US and the rest of the western world *aren't* such a jurisdiction. Neither are places like Russia, which just want to ban Bitcoin outright.
Having the option of running full nodes totally "underground" helps change the discussion and gives us a lot of leverage with governments: try to ban us and you'll have even less control. But if we don't have that option, it starts looking like regulation efforts have a decent chance of actually working, and gives governments incentives to attempt them.


This is 100% a myth. Tx fees will rise, but that changes what you use the underlying blockchain layer for and how often, not whether or not you can transact. A world where you can send anyone money for directly on the blockchain for $5, or for ~$0 via tech like hub-and-spoke payment channels, is a very good option.

It's easy to split Bitcoins via nLockTime, as the exact height of the different chains will definitely be different.

Actually banks around the world, particularly in the UK, are trying to get the laws changed to shift liability to account holders in cases of theft through hacking. For instance if someone hacks into your account/card and does a payment. To make matters worse in some cases banks are also restructuring their internal account records to ensure that I'm the event of a successful hack there won't be sufficient evidence to prove it, e.g. ATM withdrawal records.

Indeed - the few that do have problems rarely accept zeroconf transactions. (e.g. exchanges, just-dice, etc.)
@_date: 2017-02-19 15:38:20


Nope. What Bitcoin Core implemented is opt-in RBF, which is clearly labeled as replaceable, so there's no double-spend risk for merchants above and beyond normal transactions. Opt-in RBF is just a DoS attack resistant version of the same transaction replacement that Satoshi had in the early days, and Mike Hearn himself wanted to add back to Bitcoin years ago.
The real reason why merchants have stopped accepting zeroconf is simply better education about the risks, risks that have always existed. For example, look at my own [doublespend vulnerability testing of wallets]( which showed most popular wallets were trivial to doublespend, and *wouldn't even warn you* that you have been ripped off. Similarly my famous Coinbase double-spend *did not* make use of Bitcoin Core's opt-in RBF (I've had Coinbase employees privately tell me they've lost tens of thousands of dollars in zeroconf doublespends, money lost *prior* to Bitcoin Core adding RBF).
Please stop spreading the misinformation that Bitcoin Core had anything to do with zeroconf.

While your node can refuse to propagate a block, you can't prevent someone else from propagating it instead.
At best doing so might cause some temporary disruption, but it'll be trivial to work around. At worst, you might even (temporarily) cause segwit supporting miners to waste hashing power, by causing them to uselessly mine on stale blocks that non-segwit supporting miners have already extended.

RBF doesn't let you spam the network any worse than any other transaction as the fee must be increased by an amount proportional to the minimum relay fee for each rebroadcast. When we get bandwidth limits that minimum will of course scale with usage to cap bandwidth usage - obviously as a side effect that makes double-spending really easy regardless of whether RBF is implemented or not, one of the reasons why we really need to get people off the dependency on first-seen ASAP.

FWIW I changed the license of python-bitcoinlib to LGPL from (mostly) MIT, which is just a matter of changing the license notice and is perfectly legal. The license change just means new code/contributions are LGPL; old stuff remains MIT.
However, in that case I had an issue because a part of the library was LGPL, so changing it to be all LGPL fixed a legal issue without having to rewrite the LGPL code.
I 100% agree in general on using GPL/LGPL/AGPL where appropriate; crypto code needs to be open source anyway to be trustworthy; free software licensing ensures all users have the source no matter what.

It's trivial for an attacker to make that change anything but gradual.

Well if the service isn't specifically supporting the scheme, you have the same assurances as you do in general that you are actually connected to them - typically this will be via SSL and the PKI system. But at least you only have to rely on it once (locally)
If the service is co-operating, then they can just sign your key just like anyone else would do in the WoT. Also if they're a traditional certificate authority you can just take that certificate and include it as additional data in your OpenPGP key, possibly by using the key they signed to in-turn sign your OpenPGP key.

The GSM baseband chip on the Case wallet is a separate IC than the microprocessor; the only communication between the two is a serial port with a modem-like interface.

IBLT might have finally made it clear to him. That said orphan cost is a really ugly one, because it very clearly incentivises centralization - the largest pools have the smallest orphan cost, and thus no incentive to limit blocksize.
Equally as I showed ages ago - in fact the thing that got my name associated with the blocksize debate in the first place - is that if your goal is to find more blocks than your competitors it's actually in your advantage to broadcast larger blocks if you are over 30% of the hashing power(1). You earn less subsidy directly, but you'll earn more in the future as your competitors are put out of business; if transaction fees are your primary reward, this is even what'll directly earn you the most money overall.
1) To be exact, if your blocks get to 30% of the hashing power, but no more than that.

Incidentally, my lawyer's logic behind the clause being a damage rather than an outright prohibition is that absolutely preventing the other party from applying for a patent isn't really possible - if they do they've simply breached a civil contract and all I can do is countersue for damages. (hard to prove!) So instead the contract basically agrees to the damages up front - no need to argue about it in court - while keeping the amount of those damages high enough that either party won't apply for a patent frivolously, yet low enough that going to court would be more expensive than just cutting a cheque. (I do *not* have the money for that!) Finally it's a two-way clause purely to show that I'm serious about my opposition to software patents.
The other stuff in my standard contract is a no-NDA/no-confidentiality clause, and that I still own the IP to make open-sourcing it always possible. Of course, some clients have me sign other more restrictive contracts, but my rates are as much as five times higher otherwise, and even then I turn down a lot of people.

Are you familiar with the large number of projects to take the Bitcoin blockchain technology and apply it to centrally managed currencies?

(go to some FinTech conferences)
Decentralisation isn't a "means to an end" - its the unique thing that distinguishes Bitcoin from it's competition; the rest of the technology simply isn't very unique, nor is it competitive. Casually sacrificing that competitive advantage to achieve short term gains is foolish.

AFAIK a negligible amount of hashing power is running replace-by-fee.
The thing is *any* difference in mempool acceptance policy, however minor, can be used to double-spend. Equally, the Bitcoin P2P network is fundementally asynchronous, and you can easily exploit that to double-spend by sending different transactions to different parts of the network.

My OpenTimestamps service uses opt-in RBF transactions extensively to pay the minimum possible fees; timestamp transactions don't need to be confirmed quickly to be useful, so I'm willing to wait hours if it saves money. So OpenTimestamps starts off paying the smallest possible fee, then the transactions are replaced repeatedly, each time increasing the fees a bit, until a miner finally mines them.
I took a look at what miners were mining those transactions, and it looks like a majority of hashing power does, so opt-in RBF is very effective for its purpose (if you want to see details, look at my  discussion with bluematt from a few weeks ago).
In addition to that, a significant chunk of the hashing power seems to be mining full-RBF, so even if you didn't use the opt-in RBF flag you can still bump-fees effectively. I know for sure that some smaller pools are mining full-RBF, and I suspect some of the larger pools are as well given that doublespends of high-fee transactions are often mined by them.
@_date: 2015-05-07 06:42:56


So? Use a different network.
I completely expect there to be a range of transaction networks, Lightning and other technologies, catering to different ideas about regulation. Sure some will be highly regulated, but at the other end of the spectrum others will be completely unregulated and accessible via Tor. That other end of the spectrum can give you much *better* privacy and fungibility than you have on raw Bitcoin, because only the hubs have the data necessary to link transactions together.
To be perfectly honest I'm kinda kicking myself for not latching onto the idea sooner; it probably would have been a better use of my and others' time than implementing CoinJoin.
@_date: 2015-05-12 14:15:42


They're using colored coin tech, so, yes, they are.


And why would they care? They'll do what makes sense to them - they can probably afford to pay *much* higher transaction fees on most of their transactions then a big chunk of Bitcoin users. Yet they have a potential volume that dwarfs anything Bitcoin will ever be capable of directly. Finally, we have no way of blocking these non-Bitcoin use-cases as it's very easy to design systems where they're indistinguishable from regular Bitcoin transactions.
There's no easy answer to this problem.
@_date: 2017-02-11 23:04:31
Concretely, if 50% of miners mine opt-in RBF, that'd mean a replacement transaction (assuming a high enough fee) has *at least* a 50% chance of getting mined on the next block. And the actual chances are even higher than that in most situations, as the first transaction might not even be in some miners' mempools.
As I mentioned above, it looks like about 50% of the hashing power is mining opt-in RBF transaction replacements.

Keep in mind that my ideas w/ fidelity bonding required a proof-of-publication system to work. As we had discussed at the time you need to be able to prove "fraud of omission" - failing to redeem funds when asked - which means you need a way to securely publish those fraud proofs. Secondly to be able to sell fidelity bonds - required to ensure they always have a value, even at retirement - the buyer of the bond needs to know that no challenge to its validity will become known at a later date. Hence a requirement for general purpose publishing, which I've always proposed should happen on the blockchain itself.
Secondly I've made the argument for a long time that we can't prevent people from using the blockchain in ways we consider harmful through social pressure; we have to have genuine structural incentives. I brought this up with regard to timestamping and data storage well over a year ago during the first blocksize debates I participated it, arguing that we should genuinely harden Bitcoin against abuse.
Meanwhile I've grown increasingly uncomfortable with devs giving people in this space misleading and straight up incorrect advice with regard to the security properties of various systems. That the usual response to questions that deserve the answer "you need genuine proof-of-publication" is "put a hash of your data in the blockchain and store it on a DHT" is either deceptive or ignorant; it's one of the reasons I don't hang out in  that much anymore.
re: "I created this company" - you realise that only a few days ago I was telling people that as far as I knew you still didn't have a business interest in sidechains, echoing your previously stated refusal to accept money for Bitcoin-related work. Something I've heard from a lot of people today is disgust at how your role - indeed everyone's role within sidechains/blockstream - hasn't been made clear. I've personally made a point of making who I work for very much public knowledge to avoid any perception of hidden conflicts of interest; you've done a very poor job at that lately. 


Those ordinary altcoins, merge-mined or not, aren't anywhere near as useful as sidechains will be; two-way pegging is a very useful thing.

Sounds like a reasonable plan to me; good to hear you're building a [master consensus state hash into the system]( for consensus checks.
BTW, I've been working on a *much* less ambitious colored coin library for a client; I'm working on implementing secure hashing of the color proof structures right now, the same fundemental problem you have with consensus but in minature. Basically on a per-transaction basis I'm creating hashed proofs that recursively depend on hashed proofs. That structure is a DAG for colored coins; the equivalent for Counterparty might be to have a "proof-chain" where each proof commits to the hash of the prior proofs - AKA the state of the previous block - along with details of everything that when into calculating the state transition, e.g. the hash of every Counterparty transaction, the hash of the operations called etc. While this falls short of actually getting a hash of the exact steps taken to calculate the new consensus state, at least this approach captures all the data used to do so. (and maybe for ethereum you can capture the execution traces of the contracts in the state hash?)
The client asked that the code be kept private until they're ready to ship in a few more weeks, but I just added you onto the (private) repo so you can take a look.

IBLT is actually already implemented using slightly different technology by both Matt Corallo's block relay network, as well as p2pool.

It also doesn't work well in more boring cases, like mempool acceptance policy changes between different versions.

It's just standard cryptography engineering; a good resource to learn how it works is Schneier's [Cryptography Engineering](
Basically, to create two messages that have the same digest via hash collision takes about 2^sqrt(n) work, where n is the # of bits in the digest. (the term "work" basically means "one operation") As RIPEMD-160 is 160 bits, that's 2^80 work. Bitcoin itself has (to date) done roughly that much work, 2^83 total hashes IIRC, so obviously doing 2^80 work is conceivable and may become practical in the future.
Meanwhile, SHA256 requires 2^128 work to collide, or 128-80=48 -&gt; 2^48 times less work. 281,474,976,710,656 is a rather big number, so SHA256 is safe so long as flaws in the math aren't found. (and if they are, you have a much bigger margin!)

AGPL is *not* the same thing as the GPL license, and adds additional restrictions on when sourcecode must be released to include operating software that others access as a service.

Good to see Gavin talking about limitations of blocksize increases.
The question for us is if it's really worth it to "kick the can down the road" when we know for sure that this is a bandaid? We've seen what happens when tx demand outstrips supply with Satoshidice and ChangeTip, and the market certainly does respond with solutions - Satoshidice got out-competed by cheaper and faster off-chain gambling sites, and the previous on-chain tipping systems were replaced by off-chain ChangeTip. Wallets have also been giving users the ability to set and/or estimate fees. In short this has happened before and the sky didn't fall down.
20MB is a huge increase, over an order of magnitude.(1) For starters there are multiple known DoS attacks made possible by 20MB blocks, and who knows how many more we'll find? Some of them can be fixed easily, others involve fairly fundamental changes to the Bitcoin protocol to fix. (e.g. making old UTXO's expire somehow - a pruned full node could easily require dozens/hundreds of GB worth of disk space for the UTXO set if it's abused) We're also finding that some proposed solutions to known problems don't give as good improvements as we thought they would. 
On a purely technical basis, a more gradual increase makes a lot of sense. We want to be able to find out about and respond to attacks, bugs, and performance problems gradually rather than all at once is much less risky than plunging straight into the deep end without a lifejacket. I'm actually surprised that Gavin didn't simply propose that we go from 1MB blocks to 2MB blocks, with, say, another MB/year for the next nineteen years.
Of course, as I keep telling startups in this space the current Bitcoin protocol fundamentally can't scale up in an unlimited way. Even if we did a 20MB blocksize limit increase, it's easy to imagine tx demand going up by 40x, or 400x. Yet we know that with the existing Bitcoin protocol and networking technology available scaling up the blocksize to respond to a 400x demand increase simply isn't possible in a decentralized system.
For instance if banks started using Bitcoin in a big way as a backend to settle global payments they might want 400x more transactions, they can afford it, and this might happen in a matter of months. Similarly I've spoken to startups planning on doing things like on-blockchain futures exchanges that would need huge numbers of transactions to implement, yet each transaction is quite valuable - they'd have the money to out-spend "regular" Bitcoin users on tx fees and have large volume needs. It'd be quite easy to get ourselves into a position where there's nothing we can do about rising tx fees other than use Bitcoin differently and/or redesign the protocol at a fundamental level. It's best that we start understanding and moving towards that now rather than later.
1) BTW I know you made an arithmetic error in your original writeup where you came up with the 20MB number - the calculation actually resulted in a much lower number, 6MB IIRC. What's the basis for 20MB now?

First of all, it's not longest chain, it's *most-work* chain. Testnet is currently twice as long a chain as mainnet, yet it's orders of magnitude less work.
Secondly, would you want to accept the most-work chain if miners on it were creating blocks that minted 500BTC/block? Of course not - that's not a valid chain, that's an alt-coin, so your software rejects it even if it has more hashing power on it.

I address that exact point in [my article]( wallet software was *so bad* that it wasn't warning users of transactions that were trivial to doublespend without opt-in RBF (e.g. low-fees), and after that had happened, didn't even reliably tell their users that they had been doublespend. Accepting zeroconf at all in that circumstance (without non-Bitcoin defenses like knowing who your customer is) is just dumb.
As for the specialized anti-doublespend services attempting to do risk analysis and the like, they were warning about opt-in RBF prior to it actually being released. So no issues there.
@_date: 2015-05-04 01:06:25


They aren't.
You can profitably *hash* with just a few hundred dollars investment if you have access to cheap power and/or a need for the heat generated. This is why right now hashing power is fairly well distributed across the world. You've probably heard about massive mining farms operated by cloudhashing companies... but the dirty secret of the industry is they aren't as profitable as smaller operations, because those smaller operations can take advantage of small-scale opportunities for cheap power and using the heat generated. 
A weird phenomenon related to this is China, which has dozens of medium-sized hashing operations scattered all over the country. They usually operating somewhat secretively because they're getting power at below-market rates due to the crazy subsidies being offered (1cent/KWh power!) to artificially boost GDP growth.
Mining - the process of selecting blocks - is also very cheap because running a full node is very cheap. The issue is variance, which drives demand for relatively centralized pools. However, the hashrate distribution of pools changes all the time precisely because it's so easy to setup a new pool. It's not an ideal situation, but the low blocksize limit keeps the centralization of hashing and mining much less of a problem then it could be.


The issue is as always regulation. If you don't have the option of mining anonymously you invite regulation; I've spent a lot of time at conferences talking to regulators, and they're very interested in regulating mining to control the Bitcoin network.

That's for address history for the standard transactions; they have implemented prefix filtering code.
Also the bottleneck with bloom filters is disk io, not CPU, as wallets that are usually off syncing new blocks is the issue. (I have measured this) in particular using bloom with good privacy is hard there, as you want to split up your filter across multiple nodes, something bloom can't do effectively but prefix can.

I'm also not familiar with the *legal* definitions of this stuff, so anything I would be saying would be in relation to whether or not it had a hope in hell of working - I've used the phrase "indistinguishable from a scam" to describe "this is obviously never going to work" projects before.

Actually it can be done without changing Lighthouse itself:
Lighthouse already has all the functionality required for securities.
The one thing you'd need to do is write some code in the decentralized asset client to import a Lighthouse seed to recover the private key to spend the newly created assets. (and depending on the scheme, some issuer/protocol code to take the crowdfunded funds and create tokens from that txout)
Of course, some Lighthouse-specific code could make for a nicer UI, but the functionality is all there already.

"Major adoption" would be much more than a 20x jump in # of transactions; we'd have the whole problem all over again, but this time with a much more centralised network.

The former means a previously allowed behaviour is now rejected, for instance creating coins out of thin air. (an actual bug early in Bitcoin history!) The latter means a previously disallowed behaviour is allowed, such as &gt;1MB blocks.
The key thing is only miners need to adopt a soft-fork, all other software remains backwards compatible. A hard-fork means at least every fully validating node has to change.
The March event was *not* a hard-fork because older software did accept the block that seemed to fork the network some of the time, but not other times. In other words, Bitcoin Core was simply broken and acting nondeterministically.

Great answers! Almost everything I would have said myself.


I'll add to your answer that the UTXO set is 650MB, and the upper bound on its growth is the blocksize limit. While it's unlikely to grow quite that fast, I wouldn't be surprised at all if it soon became 30+ gigabytes - if just 3% of the 1TB/year max blockchain ended up being lost/unspent/used for Bitcoin 2.0 protocols you could get 30GB of UTXO set growth in a year. While we've got some ideas for how to solve this like expiring old UTXO's, actually implementing them isn't going to be easy or quick.
We also don't yet have a way for new nodes to safely get started without either trusting another node, or downloading hundreds of gigabytes of archival blockchain data. This is already an serious obstacle to running a full node, made 20x worse by a blocksize limit increase.
Finally Gavin's bandwidth numbers assume a perfectly efficient P2P network with IBLT working perfectly and a node that doesn't actually anything back to the network beyond exactly how much bandwidth it uses. Giving no margin for error/resisting attacks/inefficiencies/etc. just isn't realistic, nor is it safe.

Oh trolls... On the bright side, defending myself against such false accusations would make for an interesting use-case for crypto/proof-of-publication: put every email you make into a (merkle-mountain-range of) merkelized binary prefix tree's, indexed by destination, and then provide a proof that over the claimed time period you had never sent an email to anyone in Bitstamp. This would have to be combined with the emails themselves all having a signed merkle path to the audit log so that absense of the proof could itself be proven to show fraud in the form of not including an email in the audit log. Finally, use proof-of-publication on that audit log to ensure [uniqueness of it](
Maybe easier would be to start with my contracts with clients and make the public statement that if I a contract isn't in the audit log I won't actually honor it. This would let me (somewhat weakly I'll admit) prove I'm *not* working for someone.
edit: Of course, I could also just ask you to cough up the email - all mine are PGP + DKIM signed - but for the sake of argument lets suppose the email was full of confidential info in it to make this into a fun homework problem.

The use-case that really drived the design of stealth addresses was to put Bitcoin addresses in OpenPGP keys for payment authentication, e.g. for informal person-to-person payments. For instance I call you on the phone and say "Hey! Can you send me that bitcoin you owe me?" it's much easier if you can just select "Peter Todd" as the recipient, based on a WoT/PKI scheme, and have your wallet send the funds. Adding in URL schemes and third-party payment providers adds complexity, centralization, privacy risks, and points of failure. But of course, if the address is in your OpenPGP key, it needs to be a stealth address or you're losing privacy.
Amir and the rest of the Dark Wallet team are pretty focused on making decentralized person-to-person payments work well; they don't care so much about person-to-merchant. Nothing wrong with the latter, but it's a problem being worked on already by highly funded teams.

zk-SNARKS are just a very highly advanced form of digital signature; signatures alone just aren't enough to solve the 51% attack problem.
Basically a good way to think about it is that digital signatures let you know the transactions are truthful statements - the owners of those coins really could have spent them in the way they did. However they also could have spent them in another way.
Solving double-spending means you need to come to consensus on the *absence* of truthful statements, the double-spends. 51% attacks are all about double-spends, not stealing coins directly, so I can guarantee you Austin and co definitely haven't solved the 51% attack problem with sidechains.

They don't. They use them, but what determines their *trust* in them is not Bitcoin. People who do otherwise get ripped off frequently for large amounts of money - something I know because I've been contacted on many occasions by services who have lost thousands of dollars to help clean up the mess.
Risk scoring doesn't work when you can't get insight into what the risks are; risk scoring is downright dangerous when defeating it encourages people to attack the Bitcoin network itself.


And actual use has shown that Satoshi's ideas were wrong. Nothing surprising there - he was talking about the problem back when Bitcoin was very poorly understood by anyone, including him.


If wallets can't *reliably* tell users that, then yes, they're better off not going down that path because it's misleading.
That said, in a screwed up way I'm looking forward to seeing Bitcoin XT's double-spend relaying get widely deployed, because it'll make it a lot easier to get double-spends relayed. In fact, I'm planning on rebasing my replace-by-fee patch on top of Bitcoin XT and making it advertise the same service bits as the latter. Along with the preferential peering support that'll give many more opportunities to get double-spends relayed, and make implementing replace-by-fee features like "undo" buttons in wallets easier.

They aren't different. In my model you have n users who do k transactions. The % of validation nodes scales linearly with # of users, so p\*n validation nodes. Thus (k\*n)(p\*n) where k and p are constants, giving you O(n^2) scaling.
In your model m is actually a constant as it doesn't scale with # of users, so you'd more correctly say your model leads to O(n) scaling.

In many situations miners actually have incentives to raise the blocksize as much as possible: 
Basically this is because if you find a block you only need to get it to 30% of the hashing power for it to be more likely that your side finds another block before the other side finds two blocks. If you're goal is to find more blocks then the competition, e.g. to drive them out of business or get tx fees, propagating beyond 30% is actually a bad thing. There's no viable way right now to ensure poor propagation, but a blocksize limit increase can change that. In particular, having no limit at all just doesn't work.

For privacy you already want to do something similar; you generally don't want to tell the node your SPV wallet is connected to exactly what addresses are in your wallet.

Nah, it's not that simple. Which Bitcoin corporations are you talking about? The ones that have dreams of making money off running off-chain transactions system? If Coinbase was smart they'd want to keep the 1MB limit and hope for network effect. (although they'll find out the hard way that it's not easy to compete when things like hub-and-spoke micropayments mean you could replace Coinbase with some fly by night Russians on Tor and your funds would still be safe from theft, and said Russians can get away with doing it with chaum tokens to make it anonymous!) Conversely most of my clients doing embedded consensus stuff would love the cheaper fees for their system that a blocksize increase would give - I'm glad most of them understand the centralization danger, and have been willing to fund my treechains research.
Perhaps the group most interested in increasing the blocksize are regulators and those forced to abide by regulation. I attended the American Banker Digital Currencies conference a few weeks ago, and I gotta say, the "transparency" of the blockchain is almost a fetish for those people. Lots of those regulators and law enforcement types have a vision of Bitcoin where everything ends up on the blockchain and privacy tech is regulated out of existance by controlling mining pools and full nodes. You know, I gotta give those guys credit for understanding that those chockpoints exist, although I don't think many of them they understood that they don't exist *yet*.
As for Gavin, don't read too much into his views. He's been pushing a blocksize increase since forever now and his ideas for achieving it haven't changed from Satoshi's; it'd just as easily be a case of someone stubbornly clinging onto old ideas due to a lack of new ideas as it would be something nefarious.

That's Blockstream employee and Trump supporter Kiara Robles. She invited me to go see that exact Milo talk the other day actually.
The pepper spray came from someone in a group of violent protesters who have been referred to as "anti-fascists" who are supposedly against Milo and Trump. Though given that the way protesters win in modern politics is by calmly waiting for the other side to do something stupid on camera, I could just as easily believe it's a false flag attack by Trump supporters. :/ Anyone actually supporting the cause of anti-fascism would be idiotic to think breaking windows and pepper spraying Trump/Milo supporters peacefully attending a talk is going to help things.
The thing with violence is it's only useful if you can wield more of it than your opponent; if you can't wield more of it than you opponent the last thing you want is to give them an excuse to use violence against you. Given that Trump is followed around at all times by aides carrying the so-called "nuclear football" with the power to literally destroy humanity in a nuclear holocaust, Trump's opponents should think very hard about whether or not they can wield enough violence to make using it a good idea...

For starters having strong user-auditable solvency proofs forces the whole exchange to have sufficiently good accounting controls to stay solvent in the first place; MtGox would have been detected months before it turned into a disaster had they implemented solvency proofs. I'm not saying solvency proofs would have prevented Bitstamp being hacked, but they're such a good idea that there's really no excuse not to have them. 
Frankly, even if the solvency proofs weren't customer facing, I'd be terrified to be running an exchange without them. Then again, during the MtGox transaction mutability debacle I was on IRC helping an exchange who turned out to not even understand how to backup their wallet properly... and that wallet had millions of dollars worth of BTC in it. I won't name names in the interest of ensuring exchanges feel like they can go to us again, but learning that didn't exactly make me feel confident about the professionalism of exchanges.
Myself? I keep no more money in exchanges than I can afford to lose, and even that's just long enough to execute my sell orders.

I was just talking to a lawyer about this stuff a few days ago actually. By the letter of the law what you're doing creating Lighthouse is risky, and could definitely be found to be illegal in a court of law in the US, Europe, and many other jurisdictions. But the chances of a prosecutor actually deciding to go after you is relatively low; the law isn't a cut-and-dried algorithm, it's a political process.
Kickstarter is a great example of how this works: if prosecutors wanted to the people behind the company would definitely end up in jail; what Kickstarter does breaks so many laws around investments and selling to the public it's not funny. But them trying to do that would cause so much public outrage that it'd be more likely that the law would get changed first and the prosecutors careers would be greatly harmed, so in practice Kickstarter is pretty safe, and they've done a good job portraying themselves to the public as good actors.
An interesting question for you is should you have the [project gallery]( The letter of the law makes it a pretty risky thing to do - you certainly can be held responsible for failed projects among many other issues. But the politics of how the law is actually applied makes it a great idea: you'll have a whole bunch of "good" projects to point to if any prosecutor tried to cause you any problems, putting the whole idea in a good light, and thus strongly encouraging prosecutors to go after easier targets than you.

You know, the idea this is even "playing the victim card" seems odd to me - this is a simple fact of consensus systems, and the right approach is to keep that in mind and make the scope of that consensus - the part requiring permission - as small as possible. I've done exactly that elsewhere, and stealth addresses are just an example where the tradeoffs make it particularly hard to accomplish in the cases where stealth addresses appear to be useful.
Playing the victim card would be to make this a *call to action* - "tell your local Bitcoin Core dev to raise the OP_RETURN limit now!" - something I've been careful to avoid doing publicly, if at all. Heck, it's why I'm sitting on an unpublished writeup on this right now so I can give it a few more days thought as to exactly how I want to best describe the situation.
Anyway, if you want a good example of "playing to peoples' emotions" just look at all the language used by people on the *other* side of the debate, describing things in terms of "spam" and "bloat" and even accusing systems of maliciously trying to destroy Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-02-16 16:07:04
That's probably a fundamental problem with these systems, not anything particularly wrong with miner signaling specifically. Or put another way, any improvement would *still* have miner signalling in it.
And note that for any user running a full node with BIP66 active, the invalid blocks those miners produced did them no real harm. It's only people with particularly insecure lite clients that had any issues (lite clients *can* implement miner signalling rules, part of why we use nVersion in the block header rather than some other mechanism). The fact that lite clients didn't bother just goes to show how poorly security is handled in them.
@_date: 2015-01-02 16:28:16


BTW this is incredibly misleading. Bitcoin prevents double-spends by making them *impossible* to happen in the blockchain; even Bitcoin v0.1 tells you very clearly whether or not a transaction is confirmed and can be trusted to not be double-spent. In the exceptionally rare cases when a transaction is double-spent - or unconfirmed - due to a blockchain reorganization the Bitcoin v0.1 client would correctly show them as now unconfirmed.
He's probably trying to hint at protections against double-spending unconfirmed transactions... which is funny because his own Bitcoin XT includes a patch from Gavin Andresen and Tom Harding that was rejected from Bitcoin Core in part because it made it *easier* to double-spend transactions.
@_date: 2015-01-11 21:23:18

Now to be clear, I said "I could just as easily believe it's a false flag attack", more to emphasis how counter-productive these guys are than to say I actually think it's a direct false flag - it's not very likely that Trump supporters or the police are actually directly involved. But it certainly is possible for those parties to encourage the idiots in their opposition to do exactly that, and the left makes itself very vulnerable if it doesn't loudly and consistently oppose violence like we saw today.

I personally write my blog posts with the assumption they'll be read by thousands of people, so I want to get them 100% correct.

A case in point is BIP39 where for the sake of satisfying 5% of the users you've put the other 95% at risk - that's not a tradeoff I would make.

I discussed this idea (or at least the tech leading to it - I forget exactly which) with Christopher Allen the idea when we met at the Stanford blockchain workshop. It's a good one with good security properties - basically using the Bitcoin blockchain as censorship resistant data publication. It can do no worse than an non-PoW best effort flood fill notification system and if a majority of miners aren't trying to censor you is significantly better.
Incidentally, Christopher is one of the original co-authors of the SSL standard.
edit: To be clear, I haven't had a chance to review the low-level details of what Christopher is doing here; I've got waaay too much stuff on my todo list, let alone more unpaid work. :(

At minimum exchanges should be implementing client-side javascript wallets to hold funds in, and using micropayment channels to give the exchange control of those funds at the last possible minute to fill fiat buy orders. Similarly when a customer buys Bitcoins a micropayment channel can send them the coins instantly, getting them out of the control of the exchange. The losses from a simple hot wallet hack shouldn't be any higher than the amount of BTC backing outstanding bids at any one time. Bigger customers with online trading bots can even settle accounts right after trades are executed to further reduce the amount of BTC actually held at the exchange.

Again, that's not the point: the way the UI works is such that a user is likely to be mislead into trusting mytrezor.com


Glad to hear downgrades aren't possible.


Just because something is a problem elsewhere doesn't make it not a problem for Trezor; that mytrezor.com isn't open-source is not widely known. For instance if I setup my Trezor on mytrezor.com and then later use it with Armory without a reset I still don't have any more privacy as a compromise of the root pubkey by mytrezor.com affects all transactions ever made on the device.

Fee estimation can't reliably predict the future. Block creation is a random poisson process, so if the miners get unlucky you can easily have a drought of blocks that causes delays. It only makes sense to let people have the option of submitting a higher bid for blockchain space - just like real-world auctions give you a second chance. After all, this isn't an either/or thing - you certainly can use RBF in conjunction with fee estimation.
It may not be a great user experience in some cases, but it's definitely a better user experience than the alternative of not giving people the option of placing a higher bid. Just look at the constant trickle of reddit/bitcointalk/etc. posts from people asking why their transactions are stuck and how they can fix them.

The Lightning network paper actually suggests a special type of on-demand blocksize increase, to fix a vulnerability where a massive transaction flood attack could cause Lightning payments to time out, triggering the refund process and resulting in theft. Basically in a controlled way the blocksize would be temporarily increased to allow the Lightning channels to be committed to the chain even in the face of a transaction flood attack. It's not clear though how that changes the incentives; the idea temp blocksize limit increase needs a lot of careful peer review. AFAIK the authors aren't at all suggesting that the blocksize limit be increased as a prerequisite to initial Lightning network adoption.
In general, most devs think the blocksize limit will be increased *eventually*, but only after other scalability improvements are adopted.

Gavin wrote up an analysis leading to the 20MB number, however he made a flaw in the arithmetic and the actual number is significantly less. (6MB IIRC) He hasn't explained why he's sticking with 20MB yet.


Also other miners! You find the most blocks relative to your competition if you propagate your blocks to just over 30% of the hashing power, but no more than that. Thus for large mining pools and/or ones with fast network connections larger blocks give you an advantage at the expense of smaller pools. Obviously this causes pressure to further centralize mining.

*This* is why I support getting ourselves off the obsolete  "everything must go in a single global blockchain" model we have now to something better ASAP.

Where do you get the "megabytes" from? You already need 700MB to store the UTXO set, and that number will likely grow to gigabytes, then tens of gigabytes. Similarly to start a full node with 20MB blocks you'll need to download hundreds of gigabytes of data, even terabytes worth.
Now, sure you can cheat and get the UTXO set from someone else, but even then to do something as simple as get your node running again after a week of downtime you'll need to download 20GB of data. On my internet connection that'll take me 5 hours. If I lived in a repressive place and needed to do that behind Tor it'd take more like a day.

Nodes spawned by miners are irrelevant to this discussion; what matters is the nodes of people buying miners' coins. If the operators of *those* nodes aren't buying a 500BTC/block alt-coin, then the miners mining it are wasting their time.


If the economic majority don't want a 500BTC/block coin, then all they have to do is wait for the attackers to run out of money, and/or for difficulty to retarget. That's a temporary and survivable inconvenience.
That's why Gavin and others have been proposing to actively attack chains that disagree with them: they know that simply leaving the chain isn't enough. Particularly if the other chain also chooses to hardfork, allowing them to do things like reset difficulty appropriately, and switch PoW algorithms; note how Jiang Zhuoer claimed that they'd use the $100 million to attack chains with other PoW algorithms.

If you're going to do something potentially very harmful, explain why its not harmful and present your plans in advance.
It would have been trivial for BitGo to state publicly prior to filing what their plan was with regard to patents in general (so as not to harm the filing) and how they would protect the community with/from this patent. But they didn't, which leaves open the strong possibility there was no plan and this is actually a PR driven response to the severe criticism they've received.
Besides, defensive patents are extremely dangerous if done badly; it takes a lot of careful planning and legal manuvering to ensure they can't be used for bad. For instance, if BitGo went bankrupt it'd be easy for the patent to end up being sold to the highest bidder. Preventing this from happening is not at all trivial.

Government regulators don't want to see a bunch of numbers when they look at a "public ledger" - they want to see the actual human meaningful identities of the people making the transactions.
One of the things that worries me a bit is I get the sense that a lot of people in govt. and banking have a very mistaken understanding of how public Bitcoin is. For instance a few months ago I would up unknowingly talking to a politician at a party who thought accurate IP address information was recorded in the blockchain. When these people start to understand that Bitcoin can be used in far more anonymous ways that they expected, we may find we have less political support than we expected. At the same time, some banking/regulator people I meet understand how Bitcoin works very well - a subset of those people argue that the Bitcoin blockchain itself needs to be regulated, and targeting miners and full nodes is an obvious way to do it.

I mean, hell, I could have spent approximately a week or two last year just writing that patch and getting some miners to implement it, but I didn't because I didn't want to see people get ripped off. There's been plenty of time for people to fix their systems, and unfortunately at some point you just have to publish your work and hope people learn. Fortunately that has mostly happened, and the vendors I've spoken to who have been defrauded have all had reasonable controls in place to limit the losses.

Adversarial harms scriptSig evaluation now, but that's an easy fix.
Adversarial UTXO lookup means random access, distributed across the whe UTXO set. (which currently can easily grow essentially without bound) Also, full nodes need a full UTXO set in the current protocol, which is a significant cost I'd UTXO growth isn't discouraged.

Try actually creating a set of multiple peers doing a rescan. I've got some stress-test/attack code here that you can use: 
Back when I wrote it the entire Bitcoin network could easily be taken down with a few dozen nodes just by spamming bloom filter rescans. We've fixed some of the low-hanging fruit since, but it's still the case that bloom filters let DoS attackers force your node to use an inordinate amount of random disk IO.

That's not trustless SPV at all - you're very explicitly trusting miners with UTXO commitments in a way that lets miners do whatever they want.
While there may be tech advances in the future that change this situation, right now we have no way of avoiding the need to run a full node if you don't want to hand full control of the network to miners.

Tor has developed a huge number of very successful steganographic techniques to hide Tor traffic in other innocuous traffic. [obfsproxy]( is quite successful and used in production all the time; hiding a few hundred MB of data from censors is quite easy and tens of thousands of Tor users in countries like China use it every day.

You're misunderstanding my proposal; I'm not suggesting that segwit itself be included in the existing 1MB limit. Rather I'm suggesting that a new category of data for future upgrades be included in the new 4MB limit. Also, that new category of data isn't expected to be large - just a few dozen bytes or so for each new upgrade that needs it. Including that data in the 4MB blocksize limit really is just an anti-spam/anti-DoS safety measure.


Nope, segwit itself is unrelated to this extension data proposal. Rather, without it future upgrades aren't as safe as they could be.
As for my proposal that segwit nodes preferentially peer with each other, I didn't mean to suggest that we weren't going to do that - it's an obvious idea. Rather, I meant to explain something we were almost certainly going to do, as background to why we should adopt my extension data proposal.

If we use Lightning, and get millions of users adopting Bitcoin, they we probably don't need to change 1MB. If we get tens of millions of users, maybe we need something like 10MB blocks; hundreds of millions maybe higher.

That's useful, but are you going to fix the much more serious issue that Mycelium isn't warning their users that they've been doublespent?

Worth saying that Bitcoin Core developers make mistakes too - we're only human; spotting mistakes in your own work is very difficult.
The main reason why Bitcoin Core has so few bugs is because the developers are willing to do such extensive peer review, and accept the outcomes of that peer review. That's partly technical competency, but perhaps even more important it's a *cultural* thing: you have to be humble and open to criticism for that kind of peer review to work, and you have to have a programming culture where peer review is valued.
In fact, in Bitcoin Core good peer review work is I think considered to be a little bit *more* valuable than the work of actually writing the code. Heck, one of ways of doing peer review is to literally rewrite the code in question to make sure he fully understands it!

Another prevention is to use replace-by-fee, by sending a low-balled fee tx first, and replacing it with a higher fee tx if miners don't pick it up in the next block or two.
My OpenTimestamps system takes this to the extreme, as the central servers that actually do timestamping work by trying the lowest possible fee first, and then bumping that fee with a replacement tx every time a new block is found until the timestamp tx confirms.
@_date: 2016-01-05 15:20:21
You can replace a opt-in RBF tx with one that doesn't opt-in that's otherwise identical. (though you need to bump the fee to do so)

@_date: 2015-05-06 02:37:38
You realize you need to be uploading to two, preferably three, peers at once to get sufficient fanout to get a block to the rest of the network. So your node will take one and a half to two *minutes* to propagate a full-sized block.
Now, if everyone co-operates stuff like IBLT shortens this... but the incentives are such that large miners can often earn more money for a variety of reasons if they sabotage IBLT. There's also boring reasons why IBLT can fail, like the fact that it only works if everyone uses the exact same mempool policy. If it doesn't work then any miner on the public P2P network is now wasting 10-25% of their hashing power waiting for new blocks; this is going to kill p2pool.

What filters? The tx I sent you was unminable due to a ridiculously low fee that miners havent accepted for months. Re: responsible disclosure, this isn't a case where I did something unusual or novel - I literally used the default settings of a well known tool thats been out for over six months. Fee differential doublespending is the most trivial way to do it, the type of thing you'd put as lesson one in a Bitcoin class.
There's nothing wrong with taking a calculated risk that people will be honest, but let's put to rest the idea that opt-in RBF - or even full RBF in this case - has any meaningful impact on how likely you are to be doublespent. Equally, let's put to rest the idea that doublespending a tx takes sophistication.


I and the rest of the Bitcoin Core team have done a tremendous amount of work towards that goal by deploying CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY, and soon CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY, and segregated witnesses. All allow for better, more user friendly, payment channels and similar tech that actually can provide the zeroconf guarantees that a decentralised Bitcoin base layer can't; don't complain when we fail to help you achieve the impossible.

We don't know yet; a likely outcome is exchanges will start listing BTU (Unlimited Coin) in addition to BTC, just like Ethereum split into ETH and ETC.
Note that currently Bitcoin Unlimited is designed such that if BTC ever overtakes them in total work, all your BTU coins will be destroyed as the BTU blockchain is replaced by the BTC blockchain, so there's good reason to sell your BTU immediately.
Edit: come to think of it, this poses a huge problem for the ETF, which is proposing to blindly follow the most-work chain - if the BTC chain has more total hashing power, a big chunk of the coins the ETF holds could be destroyed.

Non-malicious soft-forks are designed to be visible to users; good wallets notify their users that their security may be degraded to SPV security - which is still pretty good! - to give them opportunity to upgrade. Bitcoin Core for instance implements this by alerting the user when blocks with unknown nVersion's are seen - all wallets should do this!
Hard-forks on the other hand degrade security *silently* to no security at all, because you may be on a minority hashing power fork that appears to be working, appears to show transactions confirming, yet will go away when you upgrade to what the majority is using. This is *much* more dangerous.
Finally, malicious soft-forks are impossible to prevent: whether or not we choose to use soft-forks to do upgrades has nothing to do with whether an attacker will use them as part of a 51% attack. I believe you are confusing this case for the non-malicious upgrade.

Absolutely - how segwit increases the blocksize was discussed in great detail in both english and chinese. Secondly the agreement is *not* be a blocksize increase, but rather a reallocation of segwit's maximum 4MB blocksize to take advantage of schnorr signatures. Again, this was discussed in detail with the miners at a technical level.

Segwit gives us a possible fallback: soft-fork, or just don't deploy, with 4MB total and take advantage of the non-bandwidth scaling improvements. A simple bump to 4MB doesn't do that.
A big part of why I signed that statement is because the plan it refers to emphasises non-bandwidth scaling solutions that actually improve the scalability of Bitcoin; I'm not sure that 4MB is fully safe, but the overall plan mitigates long term risk in ways others don't.
@_date: 2017-03-10 13:59:33
The bottleneck for Bitcoin is instantaneous bandwidth while a block is propagating; tx replacements consume average bandwidth, and they're self-limiting due to the mempool's protections against flooding.

We might! Point is the general direction of the scaling plan is a good one, and makes it more feasible to do things like that if needed.

Is your wallet verifying the PoW on block headers?

Segwit makes a soft-fork to decrease the size more platable if we need to do it, as genuine scalability solutions like Lightning work better with it. A direct increase doesn't give us such flexibility.

128 bits is considered a sufficiently large key for cases where the attacker has to try all 2^128 combinations, as is the case with a secret key. 2^128 is an ridiculously large number, so there's little worry of anyone brute forcing 128 bit keys (the Bitcoin network has done around 2^80 hashes in its entire existence, hundreds of trillions of times less work than brute forcing a 128 bit key).
However certain uses of hash functions are susceptible to the [Birthday attack]( because the attacker only needs to find two messages with the same hash digest - surprisingly a _far_ easier task than a direct brute force. The way the math works means for the same level of brute force security, you need twice as many bits against a birthday attack, which is why you see 256 bit hash functions in systems with 128 bit secret keys.

I think that's definitely a risk in the long term. In addition, there's also technical risk due to various attacks made possible in certain scenarios when there isn't a guaranteed subsidy for every block. Those risk are lower if you always have a subsidy. Of course, that comes at a cost - the inflation subsidy is a tax on savings (much the same way inflation in general is a tax on savings).
If I were designing a new coin now I'd definitely put in a fixed security tax, implemented via inflation, on the order of 0.1% to 1% as a conservative "belt-and-suspenders" engineering measure (for reference, at the moment the rate is 3.7%). But as for Bitcoin, I just don't see that kind of change happening anytime soon, if ever.

That's true in theory, but in practice a big chunk of the users don't have the ability to meaningfully look at the code. We mitigate that problem essentially through a very complex social system of layers and layers of experts, journalism, and social media. That system isn't perfect, and one of *it's* vulnerabilities is people misrepresenting themselves. So creating an environment where misrepresentation is corrected is important.
In fact, that's one of the main reasons why I've been discouraging journalists and conference organizers from saying I'm a "Bitcoin Core Developer". While I've contributed a lot more than Jeff Garzik has in the past few years, I haven't contributed any significant code changes for at least a year, and while I've done some peer review, lots of others have done more; currently I'm mostly focused on research. I'm in a professional and social position where I can definitely afford to *not* be called a "Bitcoin Core Developer", so I've decided to use that as an opportunity to set a good example.
For example, I got the upcoming [Breaking Bitcoin]( conference to change my title from "Bitcoin Core Developer" to "Applied Cryptographer", and have also gotten many journalists to have their articles describe me with phrases such as "[Longtime Bitcoin developer and researcher]( "[bitcoin protocol researcher]( "[cryptography researcher]( etc. Of course, lots of people still choose to say I'm a "Bitcoin Core developer" - including the official [CoreDev.tech]( event organized by Bitcoin Core itself -  but that's their choice, not mine.

Let's ignore privacy for a moment. Authentication is really important: without it a MITM attacker can quite simply steal money by redirecting hashing power to another pool, so obviously you need some kind of authentication simply to prevent theft.
You're not going to want to use pure public key signature authentication, because verifying signatures is quite slow - verifying a signature per message would suck. So you're going to want to use something faster.
Modern authentication encryption schemes provide exactly that: an authenticated channel between two parties where one relatively expensive signature operation is used to create a shared secret, which can then be by much faster symmetric key authentication schemes. Tons of research and development have gone into these schemes, and modern implementations are really fast: even non-hardware-accelerated chacha20/poly1305 is roughly a GB/s/core on modern x86 hardware. They're also very well researched and unlikely to run into engineering surprises.
As for "Hardening Stratum"'s criticisms, I just don't see 5% pool-to-miner overhead as significant. And as for the miner-to-pool overhead, while the % in isolation looks bad, this needs to be taken in context: we're not actually talking about much additional data.
As for the criticism that it "fails to ensure miner privacy": it's not hard to add encryption, it's by far the easiest way to add the authentication that we really need, and it's definitely going to add some privacy. I think that's overall the best engineering decision rather than risking novel protocols that may have unknown flaws in them.

So SHA1 has a *collision attack*: it's possible to find two different messages with the same SHA1 hash. However that doesn't mean I can find a message with *your* SHA1 hash - a preimage attack - I have to generate both messages at the same time.
For *just* proof-of-work, you're right that collision attacks don't matter: SHA1 is still in theory a perfectly good PoW function. But since Bitcoin uses SHA256 for more than just PoW, a collision attack for SHA256 would still be a major problem. For example, you could use it to fork the network by creating a block header that committed to two different, contradictory, merkle trees and then giving different nodes different trees. You could also use collisions to steal money from multisigs that you were a part of (figuring out exactly how is a good homework problem!).
Fortunately, SHA256 has been around for a long time, and had a ton of people studying it thoroughly; I wouldn't be surprised if it's still considered secure in 100 years.

If BitPay wants to advise their users to install btc1, they're free to do so. But they at minimum *must* make it clear that by doing so, they'll be installing software whose definition of "Bitcoin" is at best very controversial, and by doing so, they may end up accepting tokens that do not have the value they expected to get. To fail to do that is to fail to uphold the principles of informed consent.
Ultimately this no different than telling their users a few weeks ago to install Bcash, without mentioning what Bcash actually is. And if that had happened, their users would find themselves accepting tokens that are currently valued at just 10% of Bitcoin's value.
There's no reason to assume 2x will be any different.
edit: Since I'm the main architect of the infamous [Bitcoin Roundtable Consensus]( I should point out a critical thing that I and others ensured was in the agreement, emphasis mine:


Our plan was to 1) figure out how to measure "strong community support", 2) if we couldn't convince ourselves that we'd successfully done  give the post-hardfork token a different name than "Bitcoin".
The people pushing for 2x have been doing the exact opposite: 1) ignore the community, 2) call their token "Bitcoin".
@_date: 2017-08-17 16:29:46
Core is definitely not the lone holdout. The fact is only a small part of the community is supporting 2x, as shown by  node counts, etc.
Even if I thought 2X was technically sound, I'd still oppose it in it's current form: it's unacceptable for a small group to try to force all of Bitcoin to change based on what that group agreed to in a closed door meeting at a hotel in NYC.
That's exactly why when I myself was in a similar position, I tried to to make it clear that we were *not* deciding what Bitcoin would be in the future, but rather, simply making a proposal that we thought the community might accept. In hindsight I probably didn't do a very good job at that, but that's my failure, not my intent.

People were ready to declare Coinbase insolvent thieves not because it was taking them awhile - that's to be expected with cold storage over a weekend - but because they apparently lied about the cause and blamed it on non-existent network congestion instead.
*That's* consistent with a team in over their head saying stupid things because they're trying to cover up insolvency on short notice, something that's happened many times before in Bitcoin. Fortunately, the most likely explanation is their PR team doesn't know what they're talking about. But if you're in a position to take your BTC out of Coinbase, why take the risk of them getting hacked? Better to be at the front of the line than in the back with the bag holders.

It's the root cause, and the situation certainly is political.
Fact is, there's a risk of that insignificant affiliation (it's just a list of people to whom issues can be assigned) creating a false impression about his his role in Bitcoin Core development; he hasn't had a role in years. Unfortunately, there have been reports that some people were getting confused about his inclusion in that list - including due to possible misrepresentation - so removing him from it is simply prudent and presents the situation to the public honestly.
Remember that Bitcoin is security software, dealing with money. There's significant risks of people misrepresenting roles to earn the trust of users on false pretenses. We should be diligent in reducing these risks.

Well, the biggest thing is simply Emin's promotion of it as something that's "ready" while glossing over the inability to actually use it - I've spoking to a few journalists about it whose descriptions of what Emin and his team told them about it are dumb lies. For example, I recall one complaining how the fact that SGX requires a license from Intel wasn't mentioned at all, or how he gave the impression that lots of secure elements in things like phones could run Teechan, when in fact it's pretty much impossible to get access to the remote attestation functionality Teechan needs. This is particularly galling given his promotion of it as a replacement for segwit.
It's unfortunate that Emin chooses to promote his work so dishonestly. :( There's really no need to do that; I've been interested in using remote attestation for Bitcoin/fintech applications for ages, and wish we could be in a position to work together on getting access to such tech. But I don't like to work with dishonest people.

Indeed. The whole point of it was to outline something that we thought others _could_ agree too, based on our knowledge of what other devs would be willing to work with. A big part of that was "stop playing disruptive and stressful political games"
Since miners immediately broke that, no-one else has joined in.
edit: Although, to be clear, that's not to say that hard-fork efforts are stopping; no-one signed something they weren't willing to do without an agreement. In fact, the hard-fork code that Luke-Jr has written for it was IIRC something he started working on prior to the agreement.

While I think the actual technique Blockstream is applying for a patent on doesn't make much sense, I'm glad they're doing this.
Like it or not, the patent system is designed in such a way as to give an enormous advantage to patent holders over those who don't; with Blockstream's adoption of the DPL, anyone willing to commit to an anti-patent stance can be a part of the DPL patent pool. But we need patents in that pool to make it attractive to join by those not motivated by principles and ethics.

I agree 100% that's a problem; I do try to use a very different approach with developers that are new to this space, or working on projects where failure has little risk of public harm.
But Ethereum is a project with hundreds of millions of dollars at stake; dollars that are other peoples' money. In that context I have no qualms about speaking the truth plainly even at risk of discouraging some developers; in some cases the world may even be better off if some of those developers rethink their involvement with these kinds of projects.
I've mentioned this before, but I'm also involved in cave exploration, an activity that can be relatively safe if done right, yet extremely dangerous if done wrong. In my experience in the caving community, it's incredibly rare to see people criticized for failing to achieve their goals. I've seen lots of people - including myself - bail on trips because they just weren't good enough, be it because they got too tired, too afraid, didn't know what they were doing, whatever. I personally have failed in ways that were downright embarrassing - I'm one of the best cavers in my local group, and usually the guy who gets asked to do scary things no-one else wants to do, yet there's been a few times where my nerves have failed me and I've had to bail on a trip because I was just getting too scared to do something I should have been able to do.
When this kind of thing happens other cavers are almost always supportive and encouraging no matter how dumb your failures might be or whether you're a beginner or expert. But the flip-side to that attitude is if you do things that could get others hurt, or cause damage to the cave itself or landowner relations, that warm friendly attitude can change very quickly if you're not learning from your mistakes. For instance, I've very occasionally seen people chewed out for continuing to use unsafe rappelling/climbing techniques - an activity where mistakes can definitely can get you and others on your team killed. More often I've seen people chewed out for continuing to do things that could damage the cave itself after being told to stop, people who don't always come back for the next trip. And yes, I've been on the receiving end of that kind of ass-chewing once or twice myself.
Fortunately this doesn't happen often, but when it does, it's ugly and uncomfortable to watch, particularly when you're deep underground a few hours from the exit. Yet I think it's totally justified: the cost of hurting feelings and potentially making some people quit caving is nothing compared to the harm they could cause otherwise.

Thank you!
Though I wouldn't say what I'm doing is "noble" - remember that I make my money consulting, and a lot of what people pay me for is honest advice. Not only is honesty good for my long-term business success, it wouldn't be unfair to say this entire conversation is good marketing.
The people who deserve that are the ones that act *against* their best interests, at significant cost to themselves. I've never been in a position where I thought that being honest and transparent was going to do anything worse than cost me a few thousand dollars of lost business in the short term. While annoying, that's not a hard decision to make.
You know, on a personal level I do have sympathy for the people whose projects I end up debunking. Even if someone is a straight-up scammer, they're still people with feelings, with parents, siblings, and spouses who love them and want the best for them. If they're a parent, their kids still look up to them, their kids still love them, their kids still depend on them. While I get to have fun debunking their project from the safety of my consulting business, they're potentially being put in a position where they can't provide for their children. Sure, I still think it's necessary for the greater good - I'd like to think I'm preventing an even larger number of victims from being put in the same position - but I don't want to ever forget how fundamentally ugly my job can be.

MAST was never a hardfork; segwit doesn't make implementing it any easier.
Segwit does standardise a script upgrade system, but that improvement was a trivial one that could have easily been done without segwit; 99% of the work in implementing MAST is entirely unrelated to that trivial improvement.

This is one of the things the Defensive Patent License is designed to prevent.
Unlike a pledge, the Defensive Patent License is a license that you offer in exchange for consideration: the right to use other DPL adoptee's patents. So like any other contract its legally binding. Also unlike Blockstream's pledge, Sun Microsystem's patent policy was actually specific to users certain open-source software under the CDDL license rather than anyone in general, which is why Google wasn't protected by it (Oracle lost in any case).
Of course, layered defenses are always good! Blockstream's use of the IPA means they aren't sole owners of their patents - the actual inventors also have control separate from Blockstream. I'd also like to see a non-profit company setup to co-own patents for similar reasons.

In addition, I've received pure donations for the past two months with no contract from another funder matching the BTCC amount (not sure whether or not that funder wants their name public, so I'll err on the side of caution; it's not blockstream).
I don't know if BTCC is funding any other devs.

No, specifically you said "the SegWit soft fork has properties **of a hard fork**." while I said "the SegWit soft-fork has properties **not unlike** hard-forks in **terms of the need for nodes to upgrade with regard to the P2P layer.**” As urbandictionary [states](


Exactly the way I was using that term.
I'm making a far weaker claim than you are, in much more nuanced language. And as explained to you, the final segwit network behavior that has actually been deployed - while not exactly that of a soft-fork - is very different from what happens in a hard-fork. Equally, I wrote that on the mailing list almost a year ago, prior to the v0.13.1 network behavior being finalized; v0.13.1 contains the obvious fix to the problem that I suggested.

It's also worth noting that in even outside of cryptocurrencies large-scale systems are often forced to modify specs to match implementations rather than the other way around, simply because it can be cheaper and less risky to change some human readable text than modify the software people are actually using. Anyone whose actually implementing a complex spec knows this first hand: no matter how well written the RFC might be, there's a good chance at some point you're going to end up looking at the code of an existing implementation.

Miners have have to validate txs sufficiently to know at least one output is valid; higher level protocols can be built on top of that with signidicantly more functionality that miners don't know about.

You realize that the merkle-sum-tree proof-of-solvency scheme has often been referred to as the Maxwell-Todd scheme... I honestly forget who invented it - and I doubt I actually deserve credit for being the first - but I and appear to have played a big role in popularizing the idea at least.
Equally, notice how I didn't describe it fully in that blog post: the point of the post wasn't to talk about merkle-sum-tree proofs-of-solvency (there's better techniques anyway) but rather to use it as an example where ensuring consensus over a dataset is critical.

The whole point of putting "Run Bitcoin Core compatible clients" in the agreement was for miners to stop playing political games for a few months to let the situation calm down and give devs a reason to work with them (remember that until more people joined, it certainly wasn't an agreement with Bitcoin Core).

I think this is a major social problem in the Bitcoin space.
In other types of projects, we'd have a sufficiently big list of "cool projects" that we could direct people to who weren't competent enough to work on the very core, but that isn't working out in Bitcoin development. One reason is Bitcoin Core is relatively simple: it'll always have orders of magnittude less code in the codebase than, say, the Linux kernel, simply because what it does is orders of magnitude less complex (we don't have to support thousands of different types of device drivers).
The other problem is ironically that Bitcoin Core _is_ simple: it looks easy to contribute too until you understand the implications of what you are doing better. I myself experienced this first hand when I initially learned about the Bitcoin protocol and read the codebase: my first reaction was "this code is so simple, and obviously this scheme works and is a great idea!" It was only after thinking harder about all the ways that it could fail that I realized contributing to protocol and implementation development was going to be very hard.

First of all, remember that the talk I gave in Argentina mentioned this in the context of smart contracts, and iirc, I didn't even say that client side techniques could be used for _all_ smart contracts. Obviously if your smart contract is about property titles, miners aren't going to get paid in houses anyway...
Secondly, you don't actually need to validate full history to control inflation at a probabilistic level. Specifically, my tx linearization technique can keep inflation controlled at any desired level (including zero) on an amortised basis. I explained it on my blog:  as well as at scaling Bitcoin Milan.
For the purpose of paying miners, this idea let's you do some very weird stuff: coins can be valid to a miner who only accepts coins using a subset of the protocol other people support, so long as you find coins whose pruned history only uses that subset. I need some drawings to explain this properly though; I'm sitting in a cafe in Argentina right now on my phone!

You know, one of the things that I found during my time in Kenya is that many Kenyans find it insulting how so many westerners assume that all Kenyans are subsistence level poor, or that the only problems worth solving are for the poorest in the area. There's a lot of Kenyans whose incomes - or their businesses incomes - are comparable to those in western countries, yet could still benefit greatly from the easier capital movement that Bitcoin provides. Equally, those same people could benefit greatly from true scaling solutions like Lightning... but that's no different than anywhere else in the world.
I was on two panels while I was there, and one of the points I made during that was we shouldn't start by assuming everything in Africa is totally unlike western countries, and the problems we face are completely dissimilar. Kenya is still a capitalist democracy with uncensored internet - in fact, better mobile internet than I can get at home. They still eat similar food and have similar brands as back home. Sure, there's a lot that's different - for instance the amount of private security in Kenya is beyond any other place I've ever been - but by assuming *everything* is different biases you to assuming that you can't learn from each other, and we certainly can.

That's exactly it, we don't. And yes, this is sorta bad! But the state of computer science is such that defining consensus-critical protocols without resorting to executable code has proven impossible so far.
The whole point of my writeup, was that since defining standards that precisely is already difficult, the thing to do if you want to seize political power is to keep on changing the protocol at a rapid pace, while encouraging others to waste their efforts on reimplementations. So far that hasn't happened: Bitcoin XT, Classic, and Unlimited have all chosen to use the Satoshi Bitcoin codebase, exactly what I'd advise them to do if they want to have a fighting chance at changing the Bitcoin protocol.

While Bitcoin's crypto is strong enough for this to probably not be a big concern(1), alts like Zcash with much weaker/more experimental crypto may want to expire old coins as a way of ensuring that coins get upgraded to stronger cryptography over time. The alternative is to risk price dumps due to lost coins being stolen en-mass as the crypto becomes weak enough to crack.

Commit access is a burden, not a privilege. It just means you can accidentally push something and screw up other people's work, or worse, steal their coins.
Genuine, "authorized", development is done via peer review and rough consensus. Commit access just enables the last step of actually merging new code after rough consensus is reached; who actually hits the merge button isn't really all that relevant as by the time merging should happen, the decision to merge has basically been made already anyway.
Of course, you need some redundancy to let people go on vacation, get hit by busses, etc. but we really don't need more than 3-4 people with commit access, and could get away with 1-2.
Personally, if I were offered commit access I'd turn it down.

The solution only works when miners cooperate with each other, and in situations of small-vs-large miners the best strategy for large miners isn't to cooperate with small.

What you're referring to is a new seed protocol; the seed added to Bitcoin XT - while run by Mike - doesn't use that protocol so it doesn't learn addresses. This may of course change in the future when Mike adds support for that new protocol to XT.

@_date: 2015-08-16 22:24:18
Thing is, I'd argue XT doesn't have a solution. A 8x increase just isn't all that much in the grand scheme of things; as little as one or two new use-cases for Bitcoin could easily use up all that extra capacity in a matter of weeks. Equally, the numbers chosen in XT are based on little - if any - analysis or reproducible testing. For example, Gavin's simulations of block propagation worked by assuming fixed latencies, rather than trying to simulate actual bandwidth usage - a rather odd oversight IMO that makes interpreting the numbers it gave out rather difficult. Gavin has also resisted calls to make the XT/BIP101 testnet accurately simulate a blockchain with significant usage - I suggested the switchover date be set two years prior so we could make sure issues like syncing nodes from scratch with 8MB+ blocks were solved in testnet prior to running into them on mainnet. Even Gavin has admitted that UTXO set performance is an issue that's currently unsolved.
A working 1MB blockchain is still useful in any circumstance; a 8MB blockchain that's failed due to unforseen issues is useless. 
In any case, there's a scalability workshop being held [Sept 12th-13th]( to start agreeing on requirements; a second workshop in Nov/Dec will follow it to present solutions based on those requirements.

While good work, BitcoinJ implements non-validating lite-SPV, which does not improve the scalability of Bitcoin. It may appear to do so to those who don't understand how Bitcoin works, but without validation you're simply trusting anyone with non-trivial hashing power.


Agreed, gmaxwell should have mentioned that 2x scalability increase. Although keep in mind what you wrote had a lot of issues that Pieter Wuille among others later needed to fix; the 2x increase was only achieved after a lot of work by others.


When the new code you're writing can cause tens of thousands of dollars an hour in losses, sometimes it's better people don't write code... The fact that Bloom filters got into Bitcoin Core with multiple vulnerabilities is a sure sign that it was rushed.
Personally, working on the Bitcoin Core codebase reminds me of a project from my last job to write some firmware for a battery monitoring system. What it needed to do was trivial - tell the pilot if the batteries were in an unsafe state, such as overheating - but if the system ever failed it that failure could easily be part of the chain of events leading to two pilots and an operator being killed in a plane crash, not to mention the ~$3million cost of the plane and another few million of geological surveying gear. In the end the firmware was only something like a dozen lines of code - all it did was sample some ADCs and blink some lights appropriately - but it took me a solid month of work to write, document, and test.


Why is that crazy? Should Gregory refrain from criticizing the quality of work of his employees in the past, because they're now his employees? I'd rather Gregory feel free to speak his mind regardless of whether it makes Blockstream look bad.






libsecp256k1 is a cryptography library, a typical Gregory Maxwell commit in it is:




 ecmult_gen() for signing.




Equally, Gregory Maxwell's main work on libsecp256k1 has been review and testing, which isn't reflected in commit # at all. And by "testing", we really mean something much closer to the validation the IC industry uses - cpu-years worth of carefully designed testing. Testing so good it uncovered an important and extremely subtle [vulnerability in OpenSSL](
That you're comparing both types of contributions on a commit-for-commit basis makes me wonder how much you understand about the difficulties of Bitcoin protocol implementation work.

For example [Alex Morcos]( and [Suhas Daftuar]( both started contributing to Bitcoin Core only a year ago, and are currently doing great work on the mempool and on fee estimation, among many other things.

I probably do more of that than any other dev, and frankly it's both exhausting work and it's hard to make a living doing it. I've never gotten speaking fees, and often don't even get my expenses paid for conferences for instance; none of my clients are paying for public speaking and/or education.
@_date: 2015-08-25 19:30:04
Yeah, I suggested LTC ship a release with Bloom filters disabled, because a serious attack had just been found (which turned out to be multiple attacks) and at the time no Bloom filter using clients for LTC existed. I also suggested that the LTC community to run Bloom-filter-enabled nodes for wallets to use, and setup a DNS seed for SPV wallets that only returned bloom-enabled nodes.

Note that Jeff Garzik had also been hacked recently at the time - resulting in his commit access being revoked for a few days to clean things up - so it seemed pretty plausible that the explanation as to why Gavin would put something so ridiculous on his blog was an innocent one. My own blog for example is hosted on relatively insecure infrastructure (a digital ocean VPS).
Unfortunately Gavin actually believing that bullshit was far more concerning than a mere hack. After all, someone with commit access to that repo *needs* to have a solid understand of computer security, they can't fall victim to social engineering attacks, and they need to be honest. By saying he believed Craig Wright was Satoshi, Gavin badly failed at least one of those requirements.

If not for mainly Pieter Wuille and Gregory Maxwell's hard work improving Bitcoin Core's performance, the network would be currently choking on 1MB blocks due to performance problems; arguably it still is chocking on performance problems, as miners are finding it necessary to skip validation of blocks - SPV mine - in many situations to make a profit. There's more improvements coming down the pipeline too, e.g. the recent BIP66 soft-fork finally allows safe use of the from-scratch libsecp256k1 ECC signature validation library, which has huge performance improvements vs. OpenSSL. All this has been a huge amount of hard work with lots of very critical consensus code being changed and carefully tested - the libsecp256k1 testing in particular has been a heroic effort that even uncovered a major bug in OpenSSL.
tl;dr: Basically speaking the devs have been too busy scaling Bitcoin Core to actually support 1MB blocks to scale it to &gt;1MB blocks.

No, some of the Bitcoin ecosystem suffers.
Remember that the Bitcoin ecosystem has a wide range of users, from people (still!) trying to do microtransactions, to dark markets, to high value international remittance, to a whole range of smart contract/auditing stuff. The first is very price sensitive, but all the other examples can happily happily pay much higher fees with no significant effect on the economics. Equally, they all have significant opportunities to respond to price increases by using blockchain space more efficiently.
Which is point  there isn't going to be one solution to scaling up, there will be a whole range of solutions, each for different use-cases for Bitcoin.

@_date: 2015-08-16 22:47:05
The reasons why this is worrying run a lot deeper than that.
The inflation schedule means that fees are becoming increasingly important; you can't SPV mine blocks with transactions, so if miners need to SPV mine to earn a profit that also implies as fees become more important that won't be an option. IOW the problem isn't so much SPV mining directly, but the fact that it makes such a large difference in profitability right now, even though block propagation is already highly optimized. (note that Gavin's IBLT is actually already implemented by Matt's block relay network, albeit using a different technique)

1. Because there are more effective - and subtle - attacks than selfish mining (some known long before selfish mining).
2. Because mining is sufficiently centralized that the likely attackers have to think about "out-of-band" responses to attacks like the impact of bad PR and even criminal charges. Notably this makes the alternative attacks mentioned in  much more attractive.
3. The active version of the selfish mining attack makes unrealistic assumptions about the Bitcoin P2P network's topology that don't actually work so well in practice.

I [took a look]( at this and it looks like &gt;90% of the hashing power isn't using the defaults, resulting in something like a 3% total effect on capacity at best.
Frankly Jeff is trolling us, possibly to try to drum up support for his 2MB proposal, which is currently being mostly ignored by the core devs for a number of reasons, including the fact that because it doesn't measure miner support it's incredibly dangerous in the event of disagreement.

It depends a lot on the type of comment getting deleted, as well as alternatives. Drak's comments were on-topic and useful, as I noted, and contributed to discussion. Meanwhile if someone kept trying to make off-topic comments - e.g. non-technical political concerns - in a pull-req, I'd have no issue with Gavin deleting them.
For the wider issue of the big reason I mostly support theymos is because and now exist and are fairly popular. Equally, because it's meant to be a limited time-out, in response to extremely repetitive and frankly uninteresting blocksize discussion that was crowding out other discussions.
Finally, keep in mind what I actually said was that this action should "weigh in favor of" Gavin not having commit privileges. As in, it should contribute to that decision, not that it should be the only factor in that decision. For instance, Gavin hasn't actually contributed much for the past year and a half, and in general it's better to have fewer committers than more for security reasons.

Sure, changing a number is trivial, making the system still be secure after changing that number isn't.
For instance, to make RSA signatures validate faster, I could just reduce the number of bits from 4096 to 1024, or even 768. Easy peasy! But at that point it's no longer secure.

If your cleanup transaction is paying less fees/KB than other pending transactions, you're doing what the attackers what you too do: using up blockchain capacity at a lower than market cost.

We can't increase the soft limit any further in a meaningful way, and with &gt;90% of the hashing power ignoring it and setting their own limits whatever we set would have no effect anyway. Accepting that pull-req would do nothing, and the DRAMASPLOSION you're creating over it is making me increasingly enthusiastic about Luke-Jr's continual proposals to force miners to set a limit of their own choosing themselves.
*Regardless* of whether we accept or rejected that pull-req, the honest thing to do in the next Bitcoin Core release would be to point out that the Bitcoin *protocol* implements a limited-capacity network, and that inevitably results in a fee market.
If you want to change that, change the Bitcoin protocol and get your change accepted by the economic majority - not the Bitcoin Core maintainers. Wladimir van der Laan has made it quite clear that while he's lead developer and "benevolent dictator" of the Bitcoin Core software, ultimately calling the shots on what goes into that software package, he does not and can-not change the Bitcoin protocol itself.

Commit access is a burden, not a privilege; I'd turn down commit access to the Bitcoin Core repo if offered.

It'd mean if my laptop gets searched at customs, I'd have to throw it out and buy a new one. And when I bought that new laptop, I'd have to buy it locally from whatever they happened to have in stock rather than just ordering exactly what I wanted under my own name, [least it arrive with some special customizations](

Actually CLTV is relay-enforced on both testnet and mainnet, but only on the dev branch; we've never made an official release that has CLTV code in it.
Note that if you lock funds with CLTV it may be hard to redeem the funds even now. Most miners use the default Bitcoin Core codebase, which won't relay transactions or mine blocks containing scripts that execute any of the NOP's reserved for future upgrades. This is simply a safety check as in the future the meaning of those NOPs may change, resulting in an invalid block.
This is only an IsStandard() rule; blocks containing NOPx-using scripts *are* accepted.

Pruned nodes work fine for SPV, so long as you get the wallet-relevant txs off the node before the blocks are pruned.
They also work well to double-check other sources of tx data - e.g. an Electrum client could use a local pruned node to make sure the Electrum server isn't lying to it.

Those other coins are highly suggestive that 1min is too low, as even without much tx volume/bandwidth requirements they often have suspiciously centralized hashrate distributions - the lower the block interval the more money large pools earn relative to small pools, per unit hashing power.

This situation is pretty easy to fix by double-spending the txs and waiting for a miner to pick up the double-spends.
@_date: 2015-07-04 02:56:33
tl;dr: of what's going on:
A large % of the hashing power (not just f2pool) ~~is~~ was "SPV mining" where they mine on top of headers from blocks that they haven't actually verified. They do this because in most cases you earn more money doing it - latency matters a lot and even 1MB blocks take long enough to propagate that you lose a significant amount of money by waiting for full propagation.
However, this also means they're not checking the new BIP66 rule, and are now mining invalid blocks because of it. (another miner happened to create an invalid, non-BIP66 respecting block) If you're not using Bitcoin Core, you might be accepting transactions that won't be on the longest valid chain when all this is fixed.
Bitcoin Core (after 0.10.0) rejects these invalid blocks, but a lot of other stuff doesn't. SPV Bitcoinj wallets do no validation what-so-ever, blindly following the longest chain. blockchain.info doesn't appear to do validation as well; who knows what else?
edit: FWIW, this isn't a BIP66-specific issue: *any* miner producing an invalid block for *any* reason would have triggered this issue.
edit2: The majority of hashing power is now mining only valid blocks. However, **SPV wallets are still vulnerable as they do no validation**, and ~4% or so of hashing power is still mining invalid blocks. Don't trust txs in SPV wallets w/o &gt;= 2 confirmations right now.
edit3: See updated notice on bitcoin.org:

@_date: 2015-07-23 22:48:52

Anyway, the theory is stupid - mining pools can use legal tools to prevent this attack, an option only available to larger pools. (notice how p2pool has no defence...)

Bitcoin already has a trusted intermediary, miners, who can block access to your funds and in some cases even steal them entirely.
We're more worried about that trusted intermediary becoming more centralized and less representative of the bigger Bitcoin community than we are about Lightning. After all, a very similar economic structure to Lightning already exists in the form of darkmarkets, who routinely operate off-chain transaction systems. Obviously "blocking access" isn't a big deal here, because you can choose what hub - what dark market - to join that like-minded people can voluntarily choose to participate in; the cryptography behind Lightning prevents the hubs from stealing your funds. What's important is that your ability to choose between hubs is preserved bu keeping layer0 of the Bitcoin system - the blockchain - decentralized and open to all on a non-political basis.

Pieter Wuille's [simulation]( showed quite clearly large miners have an advantage over small miners with larger, slower to propagate blocks - exactly what I and others have been claiming all along. If subsidy matters both earn less income, but the smaller miners have a larger drop in income than the larger. If fees are high enough to be important the effect is even stronger. (and in some cases there may not even be an income drop for the larger miner)

Fraud proofs is the big thing.
The idea there is various types of miner fraud - creating invalid transactions - could be packaged up into short proofs and propagated on the p2p network. SPV nodes would then be able to verify those proofs and reject invalid blocks. "Lite" SPV has no such ability, and thus trusts a majority of miners, (if you're not being sybil attacked) or if you are being sybil attacked, anyone with non-trivial amounts of hashing power.

In BitcoinJ-based wallets anyone with hashing power can make you think an invalid transaction is valid, unfortunately shown last week when SPV wallets were showing transactions in invalid blocks with 6+ confirmations.

Incidentally, the wider community here may find it interesting to know that I specifically asked not to be told the details of the vulnerability. I have a tremendous amount of trust in Gregory Maxwell and Pieter Wuille, and when they tell me something is vulnerable I believe them. I'm not an expert in low-level crypto, so I figured the additional risk of having yet another person know about the issue who could accidentally reveal it - or for that matter be coerced into revealing it - outweighs the benefit of having me personally look at the problem. All I needed to know was that the soft-fork would fix the problem, whatever it was exactly, and focused my code review and logistics efforts on the mechanics of that soft-fork and how to deploy it. (IIRC the only issue I found with BIP66 beyond choosing to deploy via a supermajority soft-fork was the need to [accept zero-length signatures]( as "deliberately invalid") Also along those lines, Marshall Long in turn deserves a lot of credit for using his contacts in the mining community to help convince miners of the need to upgrade; again he didn't know the full details and was relying on trust in myself, Gregory Maxwell, and Pieter Wuille on the need for that upgrade.

No, in this case they would have had significant numbers of invalid confirmations if anyone had produced an invalid block for any reason, because a large number of miners just weren't validating properly.
In any case, the statement that SPV wallets blindly trust miners is absolutely true; it's economic incentives that make that usually work, not cryptographic guarantees of any kind.

Bitmain doesn't have any real competition; there's almost no-where else to buy ASIC hardware from. Their incentive to make their miners more attractive to sell is less than the extra money they make keeping ASICBOOST to themselves.


Yes, that's a huge problem! Fortunately access to chip fabs themselves is (so far) a relatively level playing field; no ASIC manufacturer actually manufactuers the ASICs themselves. That's all outsourced to the _very_ small number of companies who actually own top-tier chip fabs.
This could be a show-stopper problem in the future of course, which is why ASIC-resistance PoW is a worthy research topic. But it's proven to be extremely difficult to find alternate PoW's - they risk making the problem worse, by making the design and setup costs to make an ASIC significantly higher than SHA256, increasing the barriers to entry.

To be clear, by "meetings" we're talking about informal discussions at events we happened to be both attending; I don't even recall you ever even doing as much as sending me an email.


Please explain what you think those features actually are.


You are extremely confused here.
[The version]( of python-optimestamps you were looking at was a custom thing I implemented for two different clients who both needed 100% self-contained versions of OpenTimestamps. The clients at the time didn't actually want to use the OpenTimestamps codebase, but rather, wanted a very simple reference implementation for their programmers use as a spec to re-implement in other languages.
Look at the commit history: it was literally made in a few *hours*
The one-tx-per-timestamp thing you're complaining about is just a quick-n-dirty demo of the library.
The 2012 code you call "unimpressive" - which BTW was never taken off the web(2) and has always been available at  - had [working timestamp aggregation]( with a public calendar server (almost all the pre-Mastercoin multisig txs on bitcoin came from that server), multiple notary support, and I had started work on adding a merkle-mountain-range(1) hashed [journal]( to link all digests together.
1) Heck, merkle-mountain-ranges were something I came up with for OpenTimestamps itself.
2) EDIT: ..and in fact, [that very document]( links to  so obviously your team member was aware of the fact that the OpenTimestamps codebase was available and had not been removed from the web.


Frankly, why would I? I don't recall you ever offering to pay me, and while I do recall explaining to you the advantages of the [commitment operations approach]( that so far has been unique to OpenTimestamps, I don't recall you ever being interested in making use of it prior to my recent release.
Secondly, I didn't get the impression our goals were actually aligned: you were (still are?) charging companies to make timestamps via PayPal, and you *still* have never released code to actually create Chainpoint timestamps; the full OpenTimestamps codebase, client and server, has always been open source.
Under those circumstances, you asking me to "help" with Chainpoint was a rather one-sided request.


I already had a competing technology, one that was in use by paying clients, with other clients wanting to use it.


What exactly was I supposed to say? What part of OpenTimestamps do you think is derived from Chainpoint? I've asked you this question multiple times, and you've yet to actually give me an answer.

The functionality of PoW is to destroy energy to secure a blockchain in a decentralized way. That just isn't comparable to the iPhone - Bitcoin's PoW has the same basic functionality with or without ASICBOOST, except that with it some miners get an advantage over others.
Note that AFAIK, Bitmain independently invented ASICBOOST - other than Bitmain's secret usage of it, there are still miners who use the technology, so blocking it will have no affect on anyone but Bitmain. (for that matter, most if not all of Bitmain's hardware customers are probably unaware of the secret advantage Bitmain has over them)

Obviously you make each "chunk" be a self-contained set of transactions that can be applied to the UTXO set in parallel.
Equally, under your theories of how this stuff works any attack is limited by bandwidth, and an "overlarge" block will eventually be orphaned prior to fully downloading by other miners finding blocks before it propagates.

The Medium post wasn't officially released with Adam Back as 'Blockstream President' - you're thinking of the draft, which was released publicly by accident.
FWIW, Adam Back wasn't the person who actually typed in "Blockstream President" in the original Medium draft - IIRC the document was edited on Samson Mow's laptop and he probably actually typed it in based on what he assumed Adam Back would sign as.
Before the final copy was released officially Adam Back asked for that title to be changed to individual after consulting with others, including other Blockstream employees, as well non-Blockstream Bitcoin devs such as myself, both at the meeting and on IRC. That actual edit was probably made by Samson again.
The rational for that change was pretty simple: Adam Back didn't feel he could speak for Blockstream officially without further consultation with others at Blockstream. Similarly, rather than use the more common term 'Bitcoin Core Developer', we specifically used the term 'Bitcoin Core Contributor' to avoid giving the impression that the Bitcoin developers who signed were signing on behalf of all Bitcoin Core developers (edit: I personally argued for even more clear language along those lines, but everyone was getting tired so I decided to drop the issue, and instead I made it clear in my [tweet]( rather than delay things even further).
The final step in the process was a joint reading of the statement; previously we had gone through every single person signing to make sure names were spelled correctly and titles were correct, however for the final reading that part was skipped (it was about 3am and we'd been talking for 18 hours already!). In hindsight that was a mistake, and I regret F2Pool's quite understandable misunderstanding.

FWIW CPFP doesn't work very well right now, as it's pretty much only supported by Eligius, and there's no guarantee that the parent actually got to any miners. (the P2P protocol only supports evaluating txs one at a time) It's also more expensive than fss-RBF, which is supported by f2pool and soon BTC-China. Of course, simple full-RBF can work too, as proven by the double-spends!

@_date: 2015-07-17 18:54:13


Huh? In either case, if the sender wants to increase the fee of a tx they have to turn their phone on; if the receiver wants to increase a fee CPFP is needed and FSS-RBF doesn't work at all. (modulo signing with SIGHASH_ANYONECANPAY, see below)


Same deal - you're assuming only receivers ever increase fees. Equally, the sender's wallet can easily sign a few different versions of the tx at once, so the PIN only needs to be entered once.


If the sender signs with SIGHASH_ANYONECANPAY, anyone can add inputs to the tx to increase the fee. This is also a privacy improvement, as it's a form of CoinJoin.
re: "just make sure to pay enough fees" - certainly the preferable option, but fee estimation is inherently trying to predict the future, and doesn't always work. Equally, user error, like selecting "low priority" by accident when you needed "high priority"


There's enough RBF-supporting nodes out there right now that they have good reliability at getting txs to miners; they preferentially connect to each other via a service bit. Similarly, there's a DNS seed I've setup to make it easy for SPV wallets to connect to them. The interesting thing about this is even without miner support RBF ends up working surprisingly well, because miners who rejected the first tx have a high enough chance of being connected to a RBF node. Equally, about 35% of the hashing power is supporting FSS-RBF right now. (f2pool for sure, and apparently BTCChina as well)
CPFP actually needs changes to the P2P network as well, as currently there's no way for a node to tell one of it's peers that it should consider a package of transactions. If the first tx didn't get to the miner because the fee on it is too low, the second tx will just get rejected even if the miner has CPFP enabled. RBF is much simpler in this regard, as it's based on single transactions.
Finally: RBF is significantly cheaper and more efficient than CPFP, which to confirm an average transaction requires you to almost double the size of blockchain data used before you even start increasing the fee.

Emin Gün Sirer is a very dishonest guy.
For example, while he claimed that they had demonstrated Teechan doing thousands of transactions per second, they achieved that by storing those transactions in SGX enclave RAM only - _not_ persistent storage. This means that a any crash - like a power failure - requires the other side to voluntarily give your money back. Which they in turn can easily prevent by just turning off their computer.
In reality, SGX doesn't even have true persistent storage. Intel has a workaround using less secure off-CPU flash, but it's utterly incapable of doing thousands of transactions per second, and its maximum write endurance lifetime is so limited the API's rate-limit you to as much as multiple _minutes_ between writes (the Teechan paper doesn't claim to use this workaround, and the authors appear to have been unaware that it existed).
What Emin and his co-authors did there is like claiming your new SQL database is 1000x faster than the competition, while hiding the fact that it achieves that speedup by being a RAM-only database.

So Sergio and Slush both noticed that there's a remote code execution vulnerability in this backdoor. The backdoor has **NO** authentication, so any MITM attacker or DNS attacker can trigger it.
With remote code execution you can reflash the firmware on those miners, and once you do that you can permanently brick them. In fact, it's almost certain that you could permanently destroy the HW - I used to work as an electronics designer, and I did that by accident w/ bad firmware quite a few times.
So tl;dr: we have a backdoor that could permanently kill ~70% of the Bitcoin hashing power, and it can be triggered by anyone with MITM capability or the ability to change DNS records.
edit: They think this one isn't exploitable, but apparently Bitmain has [another way to remotely reflash firmware]( on Antminers anyway, so the above is still quite possible. :(
Sadly this kind of fuckup is far from unknown... Tesla for instance has the ability to quite literally kill all Tesla drivers and their passengers with over-the-air firmware updates. Both the accelerator and brakes are fly-by-wire - and the steering assist motors could probably overpower most drivers - so you could reprogram every car on the road to all accelerate out of control until they hit something at the same time without warning. Such an attack could result in thousands of people getting killed.

Why does this matter? Basically because the bad guys don't have time machines: if you can prove a git commit and associated PGP signature existed in the past, you know that attackers in the present can't have modified it.
This is most useful when PGP keys get compromised. For example, if Wladmir's PGP key got stolen today, with a timestamp I can verify that the signature on Bitcoin Core's source code was still valid, and thus be confident that I have the legit code rather than a backdoored version.

Very familiar.
It's notable that you can always take a Chainpoint receipt, and turn it into an OpenTimestamps timestamp(1), but not the other way around. The reason why is simple: Chainpoint's receipts are limited to one type of merkle tree, while because OpenTimestamps is based on *operations*, it can represent any cryptographically secure way of timestamping data(2).
Along those lines, because Chainpoint anchors can only be specified for the tip of a single merkle tree, you have much less flexibility in integrating Chainpoint into other systems. For example, I mention in my blog post how a company could [simultaneously use their own internal timestamping servers, as well as the Bitcoin blockchain at the same time]( The OpenTimestamps format supports that use-case without even requiring verifiers to be aware this is being done; Chainpoint simply can't do that.
Verifying a Chainpoint receipt is a lot harder than verifying an OpenTimestamps timestamp: while OpenTimestamps links the timestamp to a block header, something an lite client can verify, Chainpoint receipts only tell you what OP_RETURN-containing transaction the timestamp was anchored with. That means to verify a Chainpoint receipt you need an index of all OP_RETURN-containing transactions - far more data than the block headers, and also no-where near as easy to obtain if you're starting from scratch.
Finally, Chainpoint has no equivalent support for OpenTimestamp's calendars, which means that creating a Chainpoint receipt requires waiting for a sufficient number of block confirmations - that can easily take an hour or more. OpenTimestamps can create a timestamp that can be verified later in under a second.
1) You'd have to add an Ethereum notary (and I think SHA3) to OpenTimestamps of course, but that's a fairly minor change that could be done in a day or two.
2) The 0.2.0 release has some sanity limits on maximum size of timestamps, but these limits are simply there to prevent malicious timestamps from consuming all your RAM and are easily removed; I'll probably make those limitations configurable by verifiers in a future version. Unlike Chainpoint, the underlying way OpenTimestamps proofs are serialized is such that you don't need to have the entire timestamp in RAM to verify it, so interoperating with crazy ways of proving timestamps that do require large proofs is quite feasible; 99.999% of the time a timestamp is less than 1-2KB in size, so implementing this isn't a priority!
@_date: 2018-03-10 19:13:46
OpenTimestamps is completely scalable, and can do an unlimited number of timestamps with a fixed number of transactions (less than a dozen a day right now).
@_date: 2016-09-15 19:22:10
You should document some examples of that in action; your Chainpoint spec makes none of the above clear.
@_date: 2016-09-15 16:42:00
I'd be hesitant to compare the two situations; there's nothing particularly wrong with the Chainpoint standard - I have every reason to believe the fundamental idea is secure - it's just not as good as it could be. That's a very different situation from, say, where we constantly deal with outright lies and dangerous, highly insecure software.
FWIW, I used to be quite active in an electronics community, where 99% of the time the tone would be very supportive and inviting... but every so often someone would do something that was actively dangerous, and the tone would immediately shift. Similarly, I also do cave exploration - a potentially very, very dangerous activity if you don't know what you are doing - and you see the exact same thing when talking about safety-relevant things like rappelling techniques. If anything, the main difference between those communities and Bitcoin, is that electronics and caving have been around long enough that there's been enough deaths due to bad practices that reasonable consensus has developed on what those bad practices actually are; I've heard that the earlier days of cave exploration using ropes had some similarities to the Bitcoin community in terms of divisiveness, which gradually went away as the people who were doing it wrong kept getting injured and killed in accidents.

Right now the calendar servers wait for six confirmations, enough that an orphaned block is a very, very rare event. With the current code an orphaned block would break stuff, but it's an easy problem to recover from. Notably, a separate append-only "journal" of all commitments is kept to ensure database issues can be recovered from. Heck, it's even designed to use the append-only file attribute, making it impossible for non-root users to delete or overwrite the journal.
Yeah, I need to do a proper analysis of what exactly block timestamps mean and how to display them; that's one of the "known issues" listed in the README.
Trying to get better precision than a block involves trust - I won't be adding that directly to the calendar servers. Similarly, calendars don't make chains of anything. That said, it'd be perfectly reasonable to use a third party with a more traditional trust-based scheme in addition to Bitcoin, and OpenTimestamps's architecture is designed to make that easy to add later.

Teechan didn't use SGX's monotonic counters. Instead, they kept state only in RAM, which allowed them to get far higher performance than real monotonic counters would get you. Apparently Teechain work still uses that design, apparently with some additional patches like backup nodes or something.

BitShares is proof-of-stake - at best that's a fundementally different set of security assumptions that don't provide strong immutability guarantees. At worst, proof-of-stake blockchains have repeatedly failed to provide consensus and had to implement centralized checkpointing.

The problem is it doesn't actually improve resiliency: without consensus, you can't safely accept payments anyway.
We're *better* off if the network cleanly shuts down when consensus fails. Failing that, it's easier to recover if nodes at least respond to the failure in the same way. Multiple implementations of the consensus-critical parts of Bitcoin nodes meanwhile make it less likely to get a clean shutdown, and more likely to get divergence that may lead to transactions getting false confirmations that will later be reversed.
Note that this isn't all that unusual in engineering either: I've personally designed systems back when I worked in electronics where I deliberately *defeated* redundancy inherent in the system to ensure that failures would result in clean, safe, shutdowns rather than dangerous degraded operation.

Depends: if you're standing behind a different fence, built by the same company, a hole in one fence only means that their quality control isn't perfect. That's a bit of a concern, but not necessarily a big deal.
Anyway, the way Bitcoin uses Tor by default is in such a way that you're almost never going to be any worse off than not using Tor: Bitcoin uses both Tor and clearnet simultaneously, and you need both to be censored for your node to have problems.

Paying someone on a per-second basis is interesting, but what'll really be interesting is how you can use payment channels for security, scalability, and privacy. For instance, rather than making a deposit directly to a service like ChangeTip, LocalBitcoins, Coinbase, etc, you can open a payment channel with them and transfer funds from your wallet to your account instantly every time you actually tip someone. If ChangeTip gets hacked your funds are safe, because they don't actually have them! As for scalability, if ChangeTip opens a payment channel from them to you, you have [hub-and-spoke payment channels]( which can scale Bitcoin's transaction volume up by orders of magnitude. With regard to privacy, remember that none of these transactions are hitting the public blockchain, so only you and the hub have the information about them. If you don't want the hub to know, you can even use tech like Chaum tokens to make where the funds came from anonymous.
edit: For the ChangeTip case the UX could be:
1) Install app on Android phone, link to ChangeTip account.
2) Deposit funds in app; app sets up a payment channel with ChangeTip.
3) Make tip
4) Popup on phone: "Approve tip? y/n"
5) If approved, payment channel is used to send funds to ChangeTip instantly.
Similar schemes would work with Bitcoin exchanges, Coinbase, etc.

No, you need to fix malleability to make payment channels completely trustless; jspilman-style payment channels are always between two parties only. Without malleability being fixed in theory the receiver could screw you over by not giving you a valid refund transaction, but doing that doesn't directly gain them anything financially, and requires the co-operation of miners. So we're 99.9% trustless right now, and malleability fixes and/or CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY will get us to 100%

+1 beer You know on the development side one of the things we're really lacking is a agreed on threat model to gage the impact of changes to the consensus against; the majority of acrimonious debate within the dev community stems from disagreements about security that I think are ultimately disagreements about threat models. For example look at the heated debates related to Mike Hearn's assertions that you can rely on the majority of Bitcoin miners to behave not just in economically rational, but "honest" in ways that even lose them money in the short term. Or the debates re: the blocksize issue as to whether or not it's acceptable if you can't mine Bitcoin behind a Tor connection, or whether or not it's acceptable to rely on the goodwill of other miners assisting you in mining behind such a connection to use IBLT for relaying blocks. All things with clear technical answers, but very unclear political answers.
Having a study of threats would at least give the community an understanding of where the Foundation stands and what they're trying to prevent from happening.

A huge part of the purpose of Bitcoin is to *prevent* things from happening, things like double-spending, inflation, stealing coins, etc. Additionally, it must prevent those things from happening in the face of active attack.
For instance, in regular distributed systems engineering you can assume modulo failures the components of the system act in predefined ways; when those components do fail the failures happen randomly. I can easily shard a database for a bank across ten servers, and handle validation of the data by random spot-checking to get a sufficiently certain probability of detecting a failure. But Bitcoin is *decentralized* systems engineering, where security matters. If I'm running one of those shards holding part of the blockchain, I *can't* assume the others running other parts of the blockchain are honest - it can easily be in their incentive to be dishonest and deliberately not follow the protocol I'm expecting them too. I can't just test my way to ensuring the system works with high probability; I have to imagine how an attacker would attack it.
An analogy: imagine someone told you they had extensively tested a new cryptographic signature implementation by creating running billions of automatically generated unittests, all of which passed. Is this enough to know it works? Hell no! The attacker can do the math to find the one-in-a-trillion-trillion-trillion case that causes your code to fail, something that would simply never happen due to a random failure.

He thought it wasn't anonymous at all, and that everyone's IP addresses were stored on the blockchain, making it really easy to track the identities of who sent payments.
Hard to know, but if at the end of the conversation he wasn't so supportive of Bitcoin anymore I wouldn't be surprised. :/

The profit per MHash is determined by the fixed overhead of mining/hashing at all, like admin costs, learning about the tech etc. and the marginal cost of power. The fixed overhead costs are pretty small, so mining/hashing operations are almost entirely dominated by cheap power, which is only available in below market rates in relatively small quantities that are distributed across the globe.
For instance, right now a lot of hashing operations are in China, taking advantage of government subsidies attempting to artificially boost GDP, and even straight up corruption. These opportunities have costs as low as 1cent/KWh - about 10x cheaper than what you pay where I live in already cheap Ontario - but are limited by the fact that any one power source is limited in size. Thus you get dozens of hashing operations spread out all over China - a fairly decentralized setup. I know of similar hashing operations in other countries, again taking advantage of artificially cheap power, but never larger than a few MW at most.
People have also made use of opportunities that reuse the heat generated to heat homes, greenhouses, as well as take advantage of "stranded" green generation capacity like dams and wind power that's too far from the grid to effectively monetise otherwise. (power lines cost way more money than getting a sat-phone to connect to the internet) Again, it's very rare for any of these opportunities to have the capacity for more than a 1-2 MW, and usually *much* less.
I think where people go wrong here is they look at the VPS market and see huge outfits like Amazon EC2 with billions of dollars of hardware dominating the market. But Bitcoin mining is a completely commodity business competing solely on price; most of the VPS market is the exact opposite, where reputations and infrastructure matter way more than the commodity of computer time and bandwidth. Amazon EC2 for example is notoriously expensive compared to their competitors, but they're reliable, perceived to be trustworthy, and have invested hundreds of millions into completely proprietary management infrastructure.

Basically the money is temporarily put in a 2-of-2 multisig with both you and the recipient as signers; the recipient's key is why you can't double-spend. To make sure you get your money back if the recipient is hit by a bus there's an expiration time setup where the address goes back to being spendable by just the sender, implemented either with a refund transaction, or CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY.

This is an incredibly important part. A big concern with Rivetz on Intel is that Rivetz doesn't actually have any way to audit their code - Intel requires them to send them the code to be run in the trusted execution environment, Intel compiles it for them, and gives Rivetz back an encrypted blob that is impossible to inspect. It's a system designed to give organisations like the US government a cheap and easy way to backdoor trusted execution applications.
How exactly does provisioning work? How can we know what code is running?


That's more promising than Rivetz for sure; as far as I can tell they're simply being told that itst unacceptable to create ways for developers to build trusted execution apps without mfg. permission. I'd be interested to hear more about this sandbox though.

No, it *might* equate to 70GB, on the other hand, it might equate to 17TB. You're assuming the UTXO set grows slowly, which isn't something we can guarantee at all. If anything, I expect UTXO growth to increase in the future - especially if we implement UTXO commitments - as the UTXO set makes for a really useful database for a whole host of decentralized applications.
In any case, the bottleneck with the blocksize limit is mining. If you are willing to accept that mining be only profitable if you have access to a lot of bandwidth, it's not an issue; if you're threat model requires it to be possible to mine on shitty, but anonymous, internet connections it's much harder. The threat is pretty clear: governments want to regulate mining and use mining pools to implement blacklists and force changes to the Bitcoin protocol such as requiring transactions to have identity information attached. Spend any time talking to regulators at fintech conferences and you'll hear this.
Right now we have a pretty solid defense: we can honestly tell those regulators to fuck off, because if they're dumb enough to try regulating mining pools will just go underground and run off Tor sites and other highly censorship resistant - but bandwidth poor - communications mediums. More importantly, the *profitability* of mining pools that use such mediums is still high, because the amount of bandwidth you need to mine profitably is low. Equally, unlike proposals such as Gavin's IBLT, that's true even if other mining pools are trying to make you unprofitable. (with IBLT while block propagation is O(1) in the best case, other miners have an incentive to sabotage you, resulting in O(n) propagation, and them earning more money)
With higher blocksizes at some point this defense doesn't work: mining pools that are out in the open are easy to regulate with legal tools, yet they are also significantly more profitable than the unregulated pools because they have access to much faster internet connections. Since small % changes in revenue matter a lot to the slim profit margins inherent in mining, we'll see hashing power shift to regulated pools, and blacklists, whitelists, and other government mandated changes become possible to enforce.

That's Gavin's IBLT, and unfortunately it only works if everyone co-operates with each other; if people don't use the exact same mempool policy IBLT quickly degrades back to the current state of affairs. Even worse is that if you're a big mining pool who can get your blocks to &gt;30% of the hashing power easily you'll earn *more* money by sabotaging IBLT that co-operating with your competition, because that leaves more transactions for you to mine in the short term (more fees!) and in the long term drives your competition out of business. (remember that mining is a zero-sum game)
In any case, IBLT is actually already implemented (in a slightly different way) by both p2pool, and Matt Corallo's block relaying network.

First of all, it should be in terms of actual memory usage, not # of transactions, as there is about a 700x difference between them depending on how big the transactions are.
Secondly, once you do that the size basically just determines the amount of funds an attacker needs to trigger the broken behavior of removing transactions at random. What's important is fixing that, not twiddling the number. When I say "Gavin set it quite low" I just mean he set it sufficiently low that you don't need very much BTC to cause problems - 50,000 transactions just requires you to own a few hundred $ worth of BTC to create at most.

Simple: pruning doesn't mean *all* nodes get rid of the data.
When you start your pruned node from scratch it still downloads all blocks, which gives the Counterparty node software a chance to analyse the blockchain for Counterparty-related transactions.

I don't think this is possible; Bitcoin itself promotes a political agenda. The technology itself fundamentally makes huge compromises at enormous cost to achieve decentralization vs. just using trusted third-parties to sign blocks. You can't get away from the fact that doing that is inherently political.

No. Pruned nodes still need the full blockchain to sync up; with a minor software update a Counterparty node using a pruned node would simply have Counterparty process the blocks prior to them getting deleted off the disk.
Remember that pruned nodes don't export the NODE_NETWORK flag, so they don't contribute back to the network right now. They do however protect you from accepting invalid blocks. (e.g. with fake transactions in them)
edit: I'll also point out, this breaks Armory equally as much as it breaks Counterparty; I expect we'll see Bitcoin Core get a "pruning control" API soon to give apps fine-grained control of when exactly to prune blocks.

The key difference is that in merge-mined sidechains, miners have the power to not only prevent a coin from being spent, but also to steal coins. As wealth moves to sidechains, that gives miners the unprecedented power to seize that wealth and redistribute it.
Blockstream also wants to make a lot of worrying changes to how mining hardware works, e.g. implement kill switches to enable the "legal owners" of the hardware to remotely turn it off. Obviously that leaves you in a position where there may be more than one set of people with those keys.

The relevant metric isn't what commits got into the Bitcoin Core codebase, it's what commits *didn't* get into the Bitcoin Core codebase.
Socially speaking the gatekeepers there are are a high percentage of Bitcoin Foundation funded people and Blockstream funded people, with the the proviso that a sufficiently controversial change may cause acceptance of Bitcoin Core to decline. In practice that's a fair amount of centralized control in the hands of the Bitcoin Foundation, and Blockstream, for short-term development directions; long-term we don't really know.
For Olivier to campaign on a platform of further decentralizing that control seems pretty reasonable to me, if perhaps solving a problem that isn't yet serious. On the other hand, there is a serious risk that having that apparent central control may influence how Bitcoin is regulated - e.g. regs that specifically legitimize Bitcoin Core releases and the role of the Foundation (and maybe even Blockstream) in determining what is legit.

Part of "difficult to tamper" is that it's difficult to tamper _without being noticed_. For instance an attacker might try to change the firmware on the device to steal future private keys - not necessarily important in the Bitcoin case, but Case wallet is also useful for other computer security purposes.
Also, black goo makes the device more reliable by reducing opportunities for dust to get in, as well as making the device stronger mechanically. It does make repair more difficult, but if it makes needing repair a lot less likely in the first place it can be a good tradeoff.

Huh? It's in a sealed plastic case, bonded together with glue. What do you mean by "exposed"? Again, I care about normal usage.


All screens are relatively fragile; this one is behind a plastic cover at least. It's a big less fragile than my Trezor at least; currently no hardware wallets have gorilla glass like screen covers AFAIK.


So? What's rubbing is the plastic front covering - the actual buttons are behind those domes. Pretty standard and robust button design. Main downside is the buttons don't feel very good to use, but that's a different question than their reliability.


So... what does that have to do with whether or not the Case wallet is fragile _in normal use_?

That's only correct in a vacuum. For something as light and wide as a phone - or a case wallet - there is significant air resistance. (have you ever tried dropping a feather?)
More importantly the energy in a falling object depends on its mass - e_g = mass * 9.8m/s^2 That energy - if not dissipated by air resistance - needs to be dissipated by the structure of the object when it hits the ground. The lighter the object the less energy needs to be absorbed. As screens are often the most fragile part it's a big win to reduce that energy as the ability of a screen to absorb energy is mostly fixed.

Exactly. Right now the notion that you should be able to send money to anyone in the world with no intermediaries and encrypt messages with ciphers the government can't break are both politically charged opinions. In the future we'll hopefully think - like the people opposing the telescope - that the people opposing those ideas were idiots.
But for now, they're highly politically charged ideas.


You could, but it'd be a silly argument given that existing electronic financial systems already do that. In many countries banks regularly send governments 100% of all transaction details; in the places where that's not done it's a good bet that the NSA has the records anyway.
@_date: 2015-04-08 18:29:31
That doesn't surprise me in the slightest.
I've seen requirements from governments for digital currency projects that go as far as to want not only every transaction to be accompanied by identity information, but even every *invoice* to be part of the ledger. Basically if you go to a restaurant and order a vegan meal, they want enough info to know exactly what meal you ordered; the invasiveness of what these regulators want is incredible.
Similarly, a key thing for them with Ripple is that as much as they say otherwise, Ripple is a highly centralized system with a set of trusted validators who call the shots. If you need to freeze funds, it's a simple matter of telling the validators to do that. You could even get away with seizing funds by having the validators change the records - as far as I can tell Ripple doesn't have fraud proofs, so if the validators commit fraud by changing the accounts nothing happens at the technical level.

Sigh... teaches me to not dumb down explanations on reddit...
Did you read my point  The energy in a falling object is very much influenced by it's mass, and that energy needs to be dissipated for the object to stop moving. For phones, the bad scenario is the contact point when the object hits the ground is the screen - regardless of how the rest of the phone is built, the characteristics of the screen are going to be about the same so the lighter the phone, the less energy the screen needs to dissipate, and the more durable the design is.
I really shouldn't have said "faster" in my original explanation, because that's not the main effect at play... What I should have said is when a lighter phone hits the ground it has less kinetic energy than a heavier phone.

Just because most people aren't thieves, doesn't mean we shouldn't build good locks.
Bitcoin is more robust when we start our engineering with the assumption that miners are act in short-term economically rational ways. (and better yet, that a minority of miners are outright econ-irrational and malicious) When we screw up that engineering and create systems with exploitable vulnerabilities, we still have the safety margin that in reality most miners are alturistic to a degree.
If we started our engineering assuming that to begin with we'd have no safety margin. Equally, by leaving opportunities for malicious miners to earn money beyond the honest ones, we attract them; by denying those opportunities we drive those people away leaving an honest majority.

They simply create a transaction that's invalid that moves the funds from that address. A hard fork sure but...


Like I said, if you don't validate history and trust someone else to do it for you, you have no way of knowing if the above has happened. Equally, if miners want to seize funds now, they can just mine blocks without giving the actual contents to people, and wait until people get frustrated enough to restart their nodes - skipping over the invalid parts.
As for a real world case: when links to child porn were added to the Bitcoin blockchain, there were serious proposals that a list of "bad" blocks be created, and nodes would simply not download those blocks and trust a central authority to determine they were in fact valid. Such a mechanism could easily be used to get invalid blocks into the blockchain.
It's unknown how much validation needs to be done to keep miners honest - that's a social/political question - but if most nodes aren't validating full history it certainly makes it a heck of a lot easier.

Your mempool limiting technique creates a cheap network bandwidth DoS attack.
The problem is Gavin's patch evicts random transactions (and their descendants) from the mempool without regard to what fees anything paid; in Bitcoin we use paying fees to limit DoS attacks, so anytime a transaction can be broadcast without having a high probability of eventually paying the fee is very bad. Evicted transactions aren't recorded, so if a peer rebroadcasts them to you you'll redownload them. Equally that makes up a bunch of space for different rebroadcasted transactions respending UTXO's that were previously spent. Either way, bandwidth is being used that isn't being paid for.
This is all very well known stuff, and dealing with it is most of the reason why Core is [actively]( [working]( [towards]( implementing a mempool sorted by fees. That you quickly merged Gavin's patch is a sign you don't have much peer review, given that a multiple simpler, working, alternatives exist if you just want something fast to implement. (e.g. the feerate tier idea discussed on IRC/github)
Anyway, for now the advice the Core devs are suggesting is [manually raise minrelaytxfee if you're node is low on RAM]( This solution requires no additional code and can't be attacked. We probably should do a quick release of v0.11.1 with [pull-req  though, as currently in v0.11.0 (and XT) we have a bug where the same transaction will be downloaded from multiple peers if we reject it, using up bandwidth unnecessarily. (paging edit: Oh, also, because the mempool limiting code drops transactions randomly, it breaks the Matt Corallo's heavily used block relay network, increasing the orphan rate for miners significantly, and unnecessarily, during attacks. Again, increasing the minrelaytxfee setting doesn't have this issue, which is what much of the hashing power has already done.
@_date: 2015-09-09 16:54:00
FWIW this "drop txs randomly" bit screws up block relay optimization protocols, such as Matt Corallo's heavily used block relay network, as it guarantees that mempools will be out of sync. Sorting by fees OTOH is a sane, simple, and impossible to game metric for dropping transactions that works really well with the relay network.
A significant amount of work is being done right now on redesigning the mempool in Bitcoin Core to track dependencies, so with any luck by the next release we'll have a solid sort-by-fee size limited mempool. (with CPFP support and RBF support too) In the meantime manually setting your min relay fee sufficiently high to keep the spam out works well.
@_date: 2015-04-24 13:34:39
The real issue is that if Bitcoin users get in the habit of not validating the whole blockchain currently there is nothing stopping miners from deciding to change the rules. For instance they could seize funds, reallocating them to other people, and while it would be detectable that they *might* have done this, the Bitcoin Core software would still work. (perhaps after a restart)
Whether or not that's enough disincentive to miners doing that is unknown; it's a social/political question. It certainly would be a lot less disincentive then the current situation, where all nodes will flatly reject the invalid blockchain.
Interestingly, Ripple nodes do *not* validate the full Ripple blockchain on startup, which means they are already in this situation. Of course, Ripple is highly centralized anyway because it depends on a trusted unique node list (UNL) - in practice all Ripple users just use the default Ripple-provided UNL.

It is, but remember, the ability to accurately state the truth and rely on the truth *is* very political, in the same way that being against warrentless wiretapping may be beliefs that 99% of us here hold, but still is political. There are plenty of regulators in the fintech space who genuinely believe you shouldn't be able to do something as simple as mathematically prove you have funds in your bank account, because that makes it harder for the government to achieve their goals of being able to seize funds at will. Equally there are plenty of people in surveillance agencies who don't believe you should have access to strong encryption because it makes it harder for them to achieve their goals of being able to wiretap the world's communications.

That's the difference between regular engineering and security engineering: in security engineering making assumptions about the "likelihood" of failures is often a bad idea. Better to determine if a failure is possible at all, and find a way to make it provably impossible. Lately I've been seeing this a lot in my consulting business when doing due diligence on exchanges built by people from the traditional finance sector - they have good reliability engineering and I'm convinced downtime will be minimized, but with regard to security they rely heavily on obscurity and assumptions about the kinds of attacks are likely. No surprise that exchanges keep getting hacked...

The UTXO set is not kept in RAM even right now; what Gavin Andresen wrote in his [UTXO uh-oh]( post was misleading, if not incorrect.
However, the time to process a block is limited by how many IOPs - i/o operations per second - your UTXO storage can handle, and you can't rely on any type of caching as you have no guarantee what UTXOs will be spent in what order. Bitcoin is a system where failure to propagate information is a security exploit, so we have to design for worst-case performance.
Long-term we'll probably ditch the ever-growing UTXO concept and replace it with a fixed size UTXO set, where old UTXO's get dropped with a backup mechanism like TXO commitments to allow very old funds to still be spent.

Sure, if you deliberately try to damage it you can. But that's separate from the question of whether it is easily damaged in normal use. (and separate from the question of whether tampering is easily noticed!)
For instance, a bit counter-intuitively the phone industry has found that heavy, durable feeling phones are the most prone to damage, as the extra weight means when you drop them there is much more energy available to crack the screen. In practice, the most durable phones are the really light weight ones, because when you drop them ~~they're falling a much lower speed~~ they have much less kinetic energy when they hit the ground. (edit: so dumbing things down is a bad idea...)
When you say you could crack the screen, you have to ask under what circumstance will that happen? The case is fairly wide compared to, say, a Trezor, so putting it in a back pocket makes that more likely. OTOH the screen is significantly smaller than the width of the device, so it may be that the whole device flexes in that scenario, but the screen is fine in the center. Meanwhile the low weight of the device makes it less likely to hit the ground with enough force to crack the screen.
And again, if you want a low weight device that is still sufficiently strong that it doesn't break due to bending, you're going to need to make it into a solid brick with a lot of glue bonding all the parts together.

IMO offering the DPL license is a "no-brainer": it only applies to other DPL users, so you're free to do whatever you wish with your patents otherwise. Blockstream's *patent pledge* goes significantly beyond the DPL: they're pledging to not use patents offensively at all. I might also do that in the future too, but decided against it for now to limit the scope. In particular, given this is mostly symbolic anyway, I'd prefer not to incur any more legal bills than absolutely necessary. I also like the fact that the DPL is sufficiently narrow that companies who aren't fully committed to an anti-patent stance could still adopt it.

That wasn't promised to miners.
I personally was at the Hong Kong meeting, and what was suggested by myself was that a hardfork could reallocate the the 4MB total max blocksize that segwit supports to have less space for signatures in exchange for more space for inputs and outputs. That exact suggestion was mine. Schnorr signatures would make this possible, and Pieter Wuille presented on further progress on schnorr signatures at Scaling Bitcoin.

There are many situations where cryptographic proof-of-solvency helps; most failures we've seen have been mainly and often exclusively Bitcoin solvency failures.

That's not even true: multiple presentations were on the topic of blocksize. First of all, we had a presentation that suggested reducing the inter-block interval to 1 minute, while keeping blocksize the same, which is equivalent to increasing the blocksize to 10MB but with faster confirmations.
Secondly David Vorick's presentation on braiding is also a blocksize increase: by braiding the chain he argued we could tolerate faster inter-block intervals and larger blocksizes as the selfish mining risk was reduced. I talked to him later, and his own estimate was that we might be able to get 10x larger on-chain capacity with it.
Finally my own presentation on scaling client-side validation would allow a fastly larger on-chain transactional capacity. I'm not quite sure yet what's the ultimate limit to that approach, but 100x or more seems likely.
tl;dr: The fact that simple "lets increase the blocksize to xMB!" presentations weren't accepted is only because no-one submitted one that had any technical merit; multiple other proposals to scale on-chain were accepted because they did have technical merit.

Variance is a good point, although keep in mind that even without an automatic balancing mechanism, it's pretty easy - and near zero cost - for larger alturistic miners to manually move to new shards to get them started. Equally, the lower variance of the larger shard is countered at some point by the higher variance of actually getting paid - if you're payout is too small p2pool randomly drops it in such a way that while you do get what you deserve on average, your actual payment variance goes up.
Obviously a more complex complete automatic solution is ideal, but the problem isn't fatal.

FWIW, part of my reason for doing this was Sergio Demian Lerner's history of patenting Bitcoin-consensus-related technology, including [proposing technical features to aid those patents without disclosing those patents]( I recently [NACKed]( a proposal of his for Rootstock on that basis. Hopefully, Sergio/Rootstock will [rectify this situation and allow further discussion to happen]( on that proposal without the fear of anti-free-market patents.
Remember that requiring participants to adopt patent pledges of various kinds is very common practice in standards bodies, e.g. by having all companies and individuals contributing to the standards in question join a patent pool, or by making legally binding pledges/licenses to ensure any patents they hold can't be used offensively. I strongly believe we should consider some kind of formal procedure for the same with the BIPs process.
Of course, participation in the patent process is prohibitively expensive; it's likely that this license offer will remain symbolic. But I hope that other companies will follow my example, and Blockstream's earlier [patent pledge and DPL license offer](

Scalability solutions have the fundamental characteristic of making the blockchain less transparent, and more private, because they have to reduce the amount of data being sent around the network for a given volume of transactions. If we succeeded in making Bitcoin scale I'm sure we'd have a lot of push back from those who have been selling Bitcoin as a regulatory panopticon. Equally, this seems to be true of permissioned blockchain schemes as well - even banks are concerned about the poor scalability and privacy of blockchain tech.

In a system where everyone mostly trusts each other, sharding works great! You just split up the blockchain the same way you'd shard a database, assigning miners/validators a subset of the txid space. Transaction validation would assume that if you don't have the history for an input yourself, you assume that history is valid. In a banking-like environment where there's a way to conduct audits and punish those who lie, this could certainly be made to work. (I myself have worked on and off on a scheme to do exactly that for a few different clients: [Proofchains](
But in a decentralized environment sharding is far, far, harder to accomplish... There's an old idea we've been calling "fraud proofs", where you design a system where for every way validation can fail, you can create a short proof that part of the blockchain was invalid. Upon receiving that proof your node would reject the invalid part of the chain and roll back the chain. In fact, the original Satoshi whitepaper refers to fraud proofs, using the term "alerts", and assumed SPV nodes would use them to get better guarantees they're using a valid chain. (SPV as implemented by bitcoinj is sometimes referred to as "non-validating SPV") The problem is, how do you guarantee that the fraud will get detected? And How do you guarantee that fraud that is detected actually gets propagated around the network? And if all that fails... then what?
The nightmare scenario in that kind of system is some miner successfully gets away with fraud for awhile, possibly creating hundreds of millions of dollars worth of bitcoins out of thin air. Those fake coins could easily "taint" a significant fraction of the economy, making rollback impossible and shaking faith in the value of the currency. Right now in Bitcoin this is pretty much impossible because everyone can run a full node to validate the chain for themselves, but in a sharded system that's far harder to guarantee.

I'm not very concerned about that given that existing wallet software has a *terrible* track record of detecting double-spends and situations where double-spends are easy.

Namecoin has significantly less security than Bitcoin does. While it enjoys &gt;50% merge-mining support, the value of the block reward is tiny, &lt;1% of Bitcoin, so the cost to attack it is very small. In addition to that Namecoin has no technical advantages over just using the Bitcoin blockchain as the Namecoin consensus doesn't commit to the state of the key:value space; you need a full client to have any security; SPV doesn't work at all on Namecoin right now.
As for Namechains, haven't looked at the proposal in that much detail, but I think the bigger issue is I'm very unconvinced that decentralized key:value maps actually make any sense for human readable keys. (e.g. domain name system) Users seem to *like* systems where there's central points of arbitration to negotiate disputes. Equally, those disputes are security related due to typo-squatting, or just plain old squatting.

Bitcoin timestamping (and indeed, any decentralized timestamping solution) is limited to the resolution of miners' clocks. For a variety of reasons, that's limited to +- a few hours; some less-well-engineered coins attempt to have tighter bounds on that resolution, but that comes at the cost of greatly increased risk of consensus failure.
I'm working on adding a trusted timestamping layer to OpenTimestamps, where a diverse set of trusted timestamping signatures would in turn be timestamped by Bitcoin (and other blockchains). That gives you the best of both worlds: minimal trust and high precision timestamps.

I started a new coin, Bitcoin QE, where the block reward at block  is 2^0 coins per block, a block  it'll be 2^1 coins, then 2^2 coins, 2^3, 2^4, and so on.
Bitcoin QE's value is currently 10€ per coin, because I just bought one, and it's not expected to decrease, because I'm an optimistic guy.
Given a block interval of 1 second, I predict that in just one year the total supply of coins will be sufficient to buy the earth, solar system, galaxy, and local galactic cluster - pending the solving of certain communication problems we're having in the price negotiations (it's proving especially difficult to communicate with the inhabitants inside black holes, although I think it's a safe assumption that if we offer a high enough price, we don't actually need a response back to consider the deal done - it's not like we'll have a shortage of coins).

I've found that having an alternative to Bitcoin Core really helps explain how Bitcoin actually works in discussions, perhaps most importantly with the regulatory and legal community. A common myth is that the developers are in control of Bitcoin via authority, which has potentially serious, negative, legal/regulatory consequences to us. For instance in many jurisdictions people who have authority/control of money transfer systems also have significant legal obligations, e.g. to prevent fraud, reimburse losses, and meet KYC/AML obligations; I've personally spoken to people, including regulators, at fintech conferences who believed that the Bitcoin developers have these kinds of obligations and should act accordingly.
Having well-known and viable alternative implementations of the protocol helps make it clear that developers simply write software - the Bitcoin community chooses to use that software, and always has the option of choosing not to use it. Of course, there are many complex issues around coercion due to economic and mining power- your bitcoins are worthless if no-one accepts them and/or mines them - but those coercive forces do not directly originate from the developers themselves. A regulator trying to change the Bitcoin system by forcing developers to release software with code that behaves against the wishes of the Bitcoin community will most likely fail, because the community will not chose to run that software; the only power a developer like myself can wield is my skill at writing C++, writing English, and a few thousand twitter followers.

Now, suppose we *can* guarantee validity. zk-SNARKS are basically a way of mathematically proving that you ran a certain computer program on some data, and that program returned true. *Recursive* zk-SNARKS are simply zk-SNARKS where the program can also recursively evaluate that another zk-SNARK is true. With this technology a miner could *prove* that the shard they're working on is valid, solving the problem of fake coins. Unfortunately, zk-SNARKS are bleeding edge crypto, (if zerocoin had been deployed a the entire system would have been destroyed by a recently found bug that allowed fake proofs to be created) and recursive zk-SNARKS don't exist yet.
The closest thing I know of to recrusive zk-SNARKS that actually does work without "moon-math" is an idea I came up with for treechains called coin history linearization. Basically, if you allow transactions to have multiple inputs and outputs, proving that a given coin is valid requires the entire coin history, which has quasi-exponential scaling - in the Bitcoin economy coins are very quickly mixed such that all coins have pretty much all other coins in their history.
Now suppose that rather than proving that all inputs are valid for a transaction, what if you only had to prove that *one* was valid? This would linearize the coin history as you only have to prove a single branch of the transaction DAG, resulting in O(n) scaling. (with n &lt;= total length of the blockchain chain)
Let's assume Alice is trying to pay Bob with a transaction with two inputs each of equal value. For each input she irrevocable records it as spent, permanently committing that input's funds to Bob. (e.g. in an irrevocable ledger!) Next she makes use of a random beacon - a source of publicly known random numbers that no-one can influence - to chose which of the two inputs' coin history's she'll give to Bob as proof that the transaction is real. (both the irrevocable ledger and random beacon can be implemented with treechains, for example)
If Alice is being honest and both inputs are real, there's a 100% chance that she'll be able to successfully convince Bob that the funds are real. Similarly, if Alice is dishonest and neither input is real, it'll be impossible for her convince prove to Bob that the funds are real.
But what if one of the two inputs is real and the other is actually fake? Half the time the transaction will succeed - the random beacon will select the real input and Bob won't know that the other input is fake. However, half the time the *fake* input will be selected, and Alice won't be able to prove anything. Yet, the real input has irrevocably been spent anyway, destroying the funds! If the process by which funds are spent really is irrevocable, and Alice has absolutely no way to influence the random beacon, the two cases cancel out. While she can get away with fraud, there's no economic benefit for her to do so. On a macro level, this means that fraud won't result in inflation of the currency. (in fact, we want a system that institutionalizes this so-called "fraud" - creating false proofs is a great way to make your coins more private) (FWIW the way zk-SNARKS actually work is similar to this simple linearization scheme, but with a lot of very clever error correction math, and the hash of the data itself as the random beacon)
An actual implementation would be extended to handle multiple transaction inputs of different sizes by weighing the probability that an input will be selected by it's value - merkle-sum-trees work well for this. We still have the problem that O(n) scaling kinda sucks; can we do better?
Yes! Remember that a genesis transaction output has no history - the coins are created out of thin air and its validity is proven by the proof of work itself. So every time you make a transaction that spends a genesis output you have a chance of reducing the length of the coin validity proof back to zero. Better yet, we can design a system where every transaction is associated with a bit of proof-of-work, and thus every transaction has a chance of resetting the length of the validity proof back to zero. In such a system you might do the PoW on a per-transaction basis; you could outsource the task to miners with a special output that only the miner can spend. Now we have O(1) scaling, with a k that depends on the inflation rate. I'd have to dig up the calculations again, but IIRC I sketched out a design for the above that resulted in something like 10MB or 100MB coin validity proofs, assuming 1% inflation a year. (equally you can describe that 1% inflation as a coin security tax) Certainly not small, but compared to running a full node right now that's still a *huge* reduction in storage space. (recursive zk-SNARKS might reduce that proof to something like 1kB of data)
Regardless of whether you have lightweight zk-SNARKS, heavyweight linearized coin history proofs, or something else entirely, the key advantage is that validation can become entirely client side. Miners don't even need to care whether or not their *own* blocks are "valid", let alone other miners' blocks. Invalid transactions in the chain are just garbage data, which gets rejected by wallet software as invalid. So long as the protocol itself  works and is implemented correctly it's impossible for fraud to go undetected and destroy the economy the way it can in a sharded system.
However we still have a problem: censorship. This one is pretty subtle, and gets to the heart of how these systems actually work. How do you prove that a coin has validly been spent? First, prove that it hasn't already been spent! How do you do that if you don't have the blockchain data? You can't, and no amount of fancy math can change that.
In Bitcoin if everyone runs full nodes censorship can't happen: you either have the full blockchain and thus can spend your money and help mine new blocks, or that alternate fork might as well not exist. SPV breaks this as it allows funds to be spent without also having the ability to mine - with SPV a cartel of miners can prevent anyone else from getting access to the blockchain data required to mine, while still allowing commerce to happen. In reality, this type of cartel would be more subtle, and can even happen by accident; just delaying other miners getting blockchain data by a few seconds harms those non-cartel miners' profitability, without being obvious censorship. Equally, so long as the cartel has [&gt;30% of hashing power it's profitable in the long run for the cartel if this happens](
In sharded systems the "full node defense" doesn't work, at least directly. The whole point is that not everyone has all the data, so you have to decide what happens when it's not available.
Altcoins provide one model, albeit a pretty terrible one: taken as a whole you can imagine the entire space of altcoins as a series of cryptocurrency shards for moving funds around. The problem is each individual shard - each altcoin - is weak and can be 51% attacked. Since they can be attacked so easily, if you designed a system where funds could be moved from one shard to another through coin history proofs every time a chain was 51% attacked and reorged you'd be creating coins out of thin air, destroying digital scarcity and risking the whole economy with uncontrolled inflation. You can instead design a system where coins can't move between shards - basically what the altcoin space looks like now - but that means actually paying someone on another "shard" requires you to sell your coins and buy their coins - a inefficient and expensive logistical headache. (there's a reason the Eurozone was created!)
If you want to transfer value between shards with coin history proofs, without risking inflation, you need all the shards to share some type of global consensus. This is the idea behind treechains: every part of the tree is linked to a top-level timestamp chain, which means we have global consensus on the contents of all chains, and thus spending a coin really is an immutable one-time act.
Let's go into a bit more detail. So what is a coin in a treechains system? First and foremost it's a *starting point* in some part of the tree, a specific subchain. When Alice wants to prove to Bob that she spent a coin, giving it to Bob, she inserts into that subchain the data that proves that someone *could have* spent that coin - a valid signature and the hash of the transaction output it was spending. But the actual proof that she gives to Bob isn't just that spend data, but rather proof that all the blocks in that chain between the starting point and the spend did *not* have a valid spend in them. (easiest way to do that? give Bob those blocks) That proof must link back to the top-level chain; if it doesn't the proof is simply not valid.
Now suppose Alice can't get that part of the subchain, perhaps because a cartel of miners is mining it and won't give anyone else the data, or perhaps because everyone with the data suffered a simultaneous harddrive crash. We'll also say that higher up in the tree the data is available, at minimum the top-level chain. As with Bitcoin, as long as that cartel has 51% of the hashing power, Alice is screwed and can't spend her money.
What's interesting is what happens after that cartel disbands: how does mining restart? It's easy to design a system where the creation of a block doesn't require the knowledge of previous blocks, so new blocks can be added to extend the subchain. But Alice is still screwed: she can't prove to Bob that the missing blocks in the subchain didn't contain a valid spend of her coin. This is pretty bad, on the other hand the damage is limited to just that one subchain, and the system as a whole is unaffected.

Ah, but keep in mind, it's not the absolute latency that matters, but rather the relative latency between different implementations. Absolute latency is annoying, but at least everyone is on a level playing field so it doesn't give anyone an advantage.
My main worry is some kind of breakthrough technique with high costs making the relative latency differences high. (maybe something bizzare like overclocking ram with liquid nitrogen!) With 1-2 seconds out of a 600 second block interval my guess is such a miner is probably more likely to have a centralizing advantages for reasons other than just latency.

One of the things I said in todays dev meeting was the speed that CLTV is being adopted reduces the pressure on us to get the nSequence/CSV changes deployed ASAP - if miners are going to upgrade in two or three months, might as well get an important application for CSV close to initial deployment, and only then go to miners asking for them to implement the needed features.

Don't underestimate your opponent. Some BU supporters may be that, but the most important ones are simply unethical people who are willing to lie with strong incentives to do things that are harmful to the entire ecosystem. For example, Bitmain stands to lose tens of millions - even hundreds of millions - of dollars because segwit is incompatible with it's formerly secret ASICBOOST implementation. Equally, Bitmain in turn appears to have bought BitPay's support in their anti-segwit efforts - a pretty cheap thing to do when we're talking about sums of money that large. Even the people like Roger Ver probably fall into that category: he's someone who would be an irrelevant nobody if not for him taking the public views that he has.

That article is incorrect; block propagation optimisations only work if miners cooperate and have the same tx acceptance policy. Not cooperating earns them more money in many scenarios, particularly large miners against small ones, because mining is a zero sum game and screwing over your competition increases your profitability. This has been verified in multiple ways, including Pieter Wuille's simulation results. (Gavin's simulation that had opposite results didn't simulate bandwidth!)
Of course, right now miners behave extremely altruistically go each other. For instance I've been told about cases where big operations will lend each other hashing power, without even being paid, to handle outages and similar problems. But we can't design a system that assumes such cooperation will always exist - cooperation is our safety margin.

Either party can deanonymise the other: you know which coins are yours, so the other inputs and outputs belong to the other party. This is true in multi-party CoinJoin systems too, because of Sybil attacks. Unfortunately you're simply quite incorrect.

To elaborate, this is a service that only large miners can profit from; small miners/pools can't offer transaction guarantees because they find blocks too infrequently. This of course gives small miners incentives to point their hashing power at larger pools, creating centralization pressure. Offering double-spend protection is especially harmful in this regard - it only works reliably when a majority of hashing power has signed up. Services like this also have the potential to harm smaller miners by breaking block propagation optimizations, as the transactions using them don't have to be broadcast first on the public p2p network. (note that [miners have a disincentive to broadcasting their blocks to more than 30% of hashing power](
That said, techniques to increase fees like child-pays-for-parent and replace-by-fee work put all miners on a level playing field, and don't require relationships with miners. This is pretty much the reason why I've spent so much time and effort getting replace-by-fee adopted. ([looks like it'll get merged soon](
Edit: I'll also point you, you can (ab)use this service to zeroconf double-spend merchants by first creating a low-fee transaction paying a BTCC wallet address, followed by double-spending that transaction with one paying the merchant. BTCC will mine tx1 even after tx2 is created, yet all other miners will mine tx2. (and may not even see tx1) Similarly, tx1 is unlikely to be propagated widely if at all, so the merchant probably won't even see it and won't know they're being doublespent.

There isn't an easy protocol-level fix; BIP62 aimed to be a protocol level fix, but robustly removing all sources of malleability is tricky, a game of "whack-a-mole" where its hard to know if you really found them all. Equally, schemes that make malleability irrelevant are subject to dangerous signature replay attacks if not handled very carefully. (ripple has problems here) The best fix available in the short term is for wallet developers to write better software that handles malleated transactions better; that's not a protocol level fix.

Why would you assume miners are against forking out AsicBoost?
Bitcoin mining is a zero-sum game: if everyone has a 20% performance improvement difficulty adjusts, resulting in no-one having a performance improvement. Meanwhile because AsicBoost is patented, there's patent bullshit to worry about; even the Chinese miners may not be able to avoid it as China doesn't have any competitive chip fabs.
While Bitmain _probably_ can use AsicBoost without paying royalties because they have a Chinese patent on AsicBoost - a competitive advantage over their Western rivals - it may be in their long-term interests to set the precedent that patents aren't welcome in the Bitcoin mining industry.

Actually, CLTV doesn't repurpose the nLockTime field; the nLockTime field is already in use; CLTV simply lets you verify what value is in the nLockTime field with a script.
CSV by itself just does that too, but it also depends on a [second BIP](  that *does* repurpose nSequence by giving it new consensus critical behavior.
In practice, what this means is the changes required to make CSV possible (as currently designed) are a _lot_ more complex than CLTV. They also require us to give new behavior to a field that was previously unused, but did have the unique property of being signed by scripts. So we want to get this right, as once the soft-fork is enabled the bits used for the new behavior become unavailable for other upgrades in the future.
@_date: 2015-03-09 03:13:53
You understand that right: Miners are collectively a trusted third party in the sense that miners can destroy Bitcoin and/or change it to their liking.(*)
Fortunately the genius of Bitcoin is that we incentivise anyone who is a miner to act in a specific way that (should!) be beneficial to everyone using the Bitcoin protocol. Equally everyone has a (in theory) equal opportunity to become a true full-node-operating miner, albeit subject to availability of ASICs, mining pools, and the cost of running a full node.
In short, I describe miners as collectively forming a trusted third party to hammer home the fact that unless the ability to become a miner is fairly widely distributed, and the actions of miners is subject to auditing via full nodes, we're just as fucked as we would be if we all used PayPal. Or put another way, if *you're part* of that trusted third party, the fact that you have the trusted third party isn't such a big deal.
*) Of course, someone's going to complain that miners can't change the rules... but let's be realistic here: If, for instance, a convincing super-majority of miners decided that Bitcoin now had a 50BTC block reward, it wouldn't take long for the value of the original inflation-schedule Bitcoin to start dropping because it was no longer clear that the original chain was actually secure.

It's true that SPV clients can't tell the difference between a valid and invalid block - they'd happily accept a 100BTC/block chain - but full nodes can and will reject hard-fork rule changes. Those miners will simply be wasting their effort.

Eh, I've known this was a risk for a long time. Probably the first time I saw an example of an industry with rampant dishonesty and fraud was back when I was studying industrial design, and quickly realized that much of the eco-design stuff being promoted was so bad it'd even be literally physically impossible. Yet this crap was being portrayed as real products that'd soon be on shelves, and was winning design awards.
Bitcoin/blockchain tech has the right conditions for that kind of rampant fraud to happen as well.

If this isn't just a case of misleading PR - the ~~Dutch~~ Danish police actually only being able to trace *some* BTC transactions - they're either ignorant or lying.
It's easy to get anonymous BTC, even in large amounts, so long as you have a bit of patience. Simply use Joinmarket to send funds to the likes of Shapeshift, buy Monero or Zcash with those funds, then convert back to BTC. Of course, that doesn't help you with all the other standard techniques investigators have at their disposal - "Why are you able to afford an expensive Porsche yet claim to work as a low-paid bartender?", "Rat out your partner and we'll reduce your sentence", etc. - but it does get you to basically the same position you'd be in if you had a suitcase full of gold bars with the serial numbers melted off. Or for that matter, if you used a few dozen shell companies and a bunch of wire transfers - in practice the conventional financial system is a lot more anonymous than people realize, at least for the rich.
Unfortunately, we've seen the police and forensics specialists blatantly lie about what their capabilities actually are in many cases, resulting in innocent people getting convicted of crimes they didn't commit. I would not be surprised if that's happening with some of the claimed successes in forensically tracing crypto-currency transactions.

Monero gets you closer, but it's not perfect.
The problem with Monero's ring signatures in this situation is an exchange can notice that one of the pubkeys in your ring signature comes from a "stolen" coin and tell you to resubmit the tx with that pubkey left out of the signature.
What really solves this thoroughly is Zerocash, where essentially the "ring signature set" is *all* unspent Zerocash, and you *can't* leave any coins out of that set.

The "opt-in" refers to the *sender* opting into full-RBF; the sender opts into full-RBF by setting the nSequence field, which is something the receiver can easily detect and handle appropriately.
edit: To make my point more clear, remember that right now it's easy to send transactions that can easily be double-spent, e.g. by having them pay low fees. Opt-in RBF just lets you send a transaction that's likely to get mined soon, yet can also be double-spent if necessary, e.g. to add another output, bump fees, etc.

Lots of people! For example Coin Center: [How can law enforcement leverage the blockchain in investigations?](


Quite possibly. While Lightning certainly can be used in a very non-anonymous way, the fact that nodes on the network can't steal your funds means it's likely we'll see them operating anonymously, with no guarantee that logs are kept. Similarly to make my treechains idea practical you need zero-knowledge methods like my transaction history linearizion trick - or full-on recursive SNARKS - that allow most if not all of the transaction history to be thrown away permanently without making it public. (while still providing cryptographic guarantees that the rules were followed)

I'm very skeptical about the long-term viability of Factom and the value of the Factom token.
The idea behind Factom is to create a proof-of-publication medium where facts for some purpose can be published; the token incentivises people to maintain the infrastructure required for that medium. You can think of Factom as a two layer system, with Factom servers provide a layer that in turn is used by secondary proof-of-publication ledgers. By publishing records in the Factom layer you prove that the secondary layer of actual facts is being maintained honestly.
For instance one such secondary layer might be the property records of a city using a digital [Torrens title system]( to maintain land titles. Let's look at how this works step by step:
* You would know your digitally represented land title was valid because it was in the city's ledger and the digital signatures verify.
* You in turn know the *copy* of that ledger that you posess is the official version because you can inspect the ledger maintained by the Factom servers.
* You know that ledger is the official Factom layer - not a fork of that ledger - because you can run the Factom consensus protocol against the Bitcoin blockchain.
* You know you have the only Bitcoin blockchain and not a fork because of the Bitcoin Proof-of-Work consensus algorithm.
That's four steps in total. The problem is step  - the Factom consensus layer - requires you to trust the Factom servers. The issue is if the Factom servers ever publish a Factom ledger anchor in the Bitcoin blockchain but don't make the data available you have no way of proving that your Factom-secured ledger - e.g. the city's property title records - is the only copy out there and you're not trying to defraud someone. Those servers are voted in by a (quite complex) consensus algorithm, but ultimately they are trusted third parties that can break your ability to prove your Factom-secured records are honest.
Of course in practice if this happens people will just accept it and patch their software to ignore the failure... but then why use Factom at all? You can do the exact same thing with *far* less complexity by just securing your ledger directly in the Bitcoin blockchain, skipping step  and the dependency on trusted third parties. (I don't mean putting the ledger itself in the chain, just hashes of it)
The only disadvantage to securing your records directly in the Bitcoin blockchain is you have to pay transaction fees to do it. However currently those fees are very small - they'll always be about the cost to make a transaction - and if they do increase it's easy to create "meta-ledgers" based on explicit trust relationships. For instance a bunch of cities can get together to establish a meta-ledger for all their per-city property title systems, perhaps using efficient [threshold-signature]( multisig to ensure that a majority of those cities have to sign off on any updates to the meta-ledger.
Of course all these Factom alternatives can be argued to "bloat the blockchain" - but how are we going to force people to use less secure alternatives to just using the blockchain? It's impossible to stop people from securing ledgers in the blockchain technically; our only way to do it is via social pressure like writing angry posts on reddit and lawsuits.
tl;dr: For the Facom token to rise in value we need Bitcoin transaction fees to rise greatly, and/or people to choose to use much more complex and less secure systems in preference to much more simple systems.
Disclaimer: I've been hired by Factom to review the Factom protocol. I also am working on a competing library called Proofchains that among other things can be used to secure ledgers using Bitcoin directly. That funding model for that effort is to convince individual clients that they need the technology and should pay me to develop it.

Viacoin has mostly the same codebase as Bitcoin Core, so work done on Core gets ported to Viacoin very quickly. Equally, some stuff - like CLTV - got ported to Viacoin prior to getting merged into Bitcoin.
I was also going to work on treechains, but soon realised that I needed to do a lot more work on applications for it first, which later became my Proofchains concept. I managed to get a different client to pay for that work, so in the end Viacoin didn't pay for any treechains development.

Honestly, it's even weirder than that: Emin isn't very respected in the academic community either. Selfish mining was good work, but then it turned out his contribution was to make a better math model for earlier ideas - he wasn't at all the person to discover it, and the way he presented it was [arguably plagarism]( And other than that, his research hasn't gotten all that much attention. I remember talking to a few career academics about Teechan when it was released, and their response was universally that as an academic work, it was a joke - with remote attestation it's obviously possible to build Teechan and lots of people have done that research already. And that was *before* people realized Emin had been lying about how many tx/s Teechan could actually do.
I just don't get the guy. We used to be good friends, but he seems all too willing to take the easy way out. Which is doubly silly because he *is* a good self-promoter and public speaker, and could have a successful and honest career even without doing any novel research himself.

Remember, when a bank steals your money they take a (hopefully!) big risk too: in the real world we can take banks to court. Yet they're still a trusted third party, we just have way to punish them after the fact to discourage them from abusing their trust.

Huh? Wladimir has made it clear that with regard to non-consensus changes, his role is benevolent dictator. Making BIP37 optional isn't a consensus-critical change. In fact, making changes like that is much easier now that Bitcoin XT exists - people who disagree have a valid alternative.
With regard to consensus changes, with soft-forks you need a supermajority of hashing power to make a safe change. We just need to convince the mining community that the change is a good one, and getting the respected developers known for consensus-related work on board with a change seems to work pretty well there. If you don't agree with that, your option is to lobby miners and convince them not to adopt CLTV - that is, not to listen to us.
With hard-forks, you definitely need a supermajority of the Bitcoin community as a whole, which is why extremely broad consensus is so important.


Why do Maxwell and Wladimir have a magic ability to stop blocks from getting bigger? There is no technical mechanism that prevents the Bitcoin community from ignoring them. That blocks aren't getting bigger is a clear sign that there isn't social consensus to make them bigger. Of course, I think you know this because you're efforts with Bitcoin XT are on the right track to change that social consensus. If people aren't changing their minds, there are deeper reasons that you need to address.

Looks like you can verify that the firmware is what it is supposed to be, although that doesn't mean source code is available for all of it (yet): 
What they say on the wiki is pretty reasonable:


Incidentally, from a physics point of view, you can definitely - in theory - make electronic devices that really are tamperproof, simply because you can design circuits that are so physically small, with such low signal levels, as to be impossible to tamper in a way undetectable to the anti-tamper circuit. This is kinda like how quantum physics makes certain types of measurements impossible, like the famous limits on how accurately you can know a particle's velocity and position simultaneously. Such designs aren't necessarily easy to get right, nor always practical due to false triggering, but it's certainly possible to do in principle.

This is a perfect example of the segwit2x team failing to understand how security works; it's the consensus security equivalent of [putting a gate across a path in the middle of a wide-open lawn](
It only takes a single DoS transaction to perform a O(n^2) sighash DoS attack, and because it's a n^2 attack splitting your attack into more than one transaction makes no sense: ~~n^2 &gt; 2*(n/2)^2~~ edit: as points out below, I was forgetting about the 1MB per tx limit, so that equation is technically the incorrect one to use. However, unfortunately the n^2 dominates and the attack is still there, yet by adding this rule you complicate actually fixing the situation properly in the future.
There's also the issue that there's no tests for this change, let alone a properly argued BIP. It's far from the high standards needed to keep a $40 billion economy safe.

@_date: 2017-05-11 13:35:10
Exactly. However, even if you did try to use Bitcoin timestamping for a few seconds, in reality you'd be introducing trust anyway as miners can manipulate timestamps on that scale; systems that try to avoid that just introduce massive consensus risks without actually increasing timestamp accuracy.
Remember that the *precison* of a Bitcoin timestamp is 1 second - it's the accuracy that's multiple hours wide.
That's also why I said "minimal trust and high precision timestamps" above - I don't want to quite yet claim I actually can do both high accuracy and high precision until I'm convinced I really can. :)

Fortunately, soft-forks don't need ecosystem-wide consensus to deploy - we just need to convince a supermajority of miners that another soft-fork is a good idea and it'll happen.
If Bitcoin XT - for example - doesn't like the soft-fork deployment mechanism they're free to ignore it and propose a hard-fork. But the latter won't happen without very broad consensus...
@_date: 2015-11-24 12:49:37
A potential dealbreaker with this scheme is that it takes 30 seconds to attempt a PoW solution. The problem is that's a very significant fraction of the block interval, so if one miner is running on hardware that takes 30 seconds, but another miner can do the calculation in 1 second, the latter will have a large latency advantage over the former even if they don't have as much hashing power.
Hopefully the authors of this paper simply aren't aware of this issue and didn't tune the algorithm for less latency; if latency could be reduced to a second or two it'd probably be fine.

I'll repeat [my reply]( from the mailing list here:
One of your arguments against soft-forks has been that they "fool nodes"(1) by changing the rules in undetectable ways. One of the counter arguments to your argument is we explicitly ensure that soft fork mechanisms use nVersion
signalling to ensure all nodes are given an opportunity to learn that the fork is happening; malicious soft-forks of course don't do this, but the fact they're possible is an unavoidable by-product of Bitcoin's design.
From the point of view of a headers only lite client, segwit2x is a soft fork with no nVersion signalling mechanism.
Now, to be secure all wallets, lite clients or not, will need updating in the event of a hard fork to - for instance - ensure they're getting seed nodes from appropriate places and the like, and to ensure funds aren't lost in replay attacks. I'm unclear as to why something that can be fixed in a line or two of code - code that needs to be changed anyway to safely support the hard fork trumps these important issues of user consent that you have brought up before yourself.

Embedded consensus systems (Mastercoin/Counterparty) have always been able to operate with 2-way-pegs without any changes to Bitcoin; the tokens they need for technical reasons don't need to have a price decoupled from the price of Bitcoin. Yet the creators choose not to use that technology, because you have to pay developers somehow. Sidechains and their 2-way-pegs will be no different, modulo better marketing and (perhaps) regulatory crackdowns.
@_date: 2015-11-24 12:13:39
There's a tricky incentives problem here though: if a miner can extend a subchain without actually having previous blocks in that chain, where's the incentive for that miner to give anyone else the blocks they create? Remember that exclusive knowledge of a block is potentially valuable if you can extort coin owners for it. (Bitcoin suffers from this problem right now with validationless "SPV" mining, though the fact that a block can be invalid in Bitcoin helps limit its effects)
Part of the solution could be mining reward; in Bitcoin, coinbase outputs can't be spent for 100 blocks. A similar scheme could require that a spend of a coinbase output in a subchain include proof that the next X blocks in that subchain were in fact linked together. Secondly make block creation dependent on actually having that data to ensure the linkage actually means something, e.g. by introducing some validity rules so blocks can be invalid, and/or using a PoW function that requires hashers to have a copy of that data.
Ultimately though this isn't magic: like it or not lower subchains in such a system are inherently weaker and more dangerous than higher ones, and this is equally true of any sharded system. However a hierarchically sharded system like treechains can give users options: higher subchains are safer, but transactions will expensive. The hierarchy does combine the PoW security of all subchains together for the thing you can easily combine: timestamping security.
There's a big problem though: holy !@ is the above complex compared to Bitcoin! Even the "kiddy" version of sharding - my linearization scheme rather than zk-SNARKS - is probably one or two orders of magnitude more complex than using the Bitcoin protocol is right now, yet right now a huge % of the companies in this space seem to have thrown their hands up and used centralized API providers instead. Actually implementing the above and getting it into the hands of end-users won't be easy.
On the other hand, decentralization isn't cheap: using PayPal is one or two orders of magnitude simpler than the Bitcoin protocol.

Copy-n-paste from 
Your mempool limiting technique creates a cheap network bandwidth DoS attack.
The problem is Gavin's patch evicts random transactions (and their descendants) from the mempool without regard to what fees anything paid; in Bitcoin we use paying fees to limit DoS attacks, so anytime a transaction can be broadcast without having a high probability of eventually paying the fee is very bad. Evicted transactions aren't recorded, so if a peer rebroadcasts them to you you'll redownload them. Equally that makes up a bunch of space for different rebroadcasted transactions respending UTXO's that were previously spent. Either way, bandwidth is being used that isn't being paid for.
This is all very well known stuff, and dealing with it is most of the reason why Core is [actively]( [working]( [towards]( implementing a mempool sorted by fees. That you quickly merged Gavin's patch is a sign you don't have much peer review, given that a multiple simpler, working, alternatives exist if you just want something fast to implement. (e.g. the feerate tier idea discussed on IRC/github)
Anyway, for now the advice the Core devs are suggesting is [manually raise minrelaytxfee if you're node is low on RAM]( This solution requires no additional code and can't be attacked. We probably should do a quick release of v0.11.1 with [pull-req  though, as currently in v0.11.0 (and XT) we have a bug where the same transaction will be downloaded from multiple peers if we reject it, using up bandwidth unnecessarily. (paging edit: Oh, also, because the mempool limiting code drops transactions randomly, it breaks the Matt Corallo's heavily used block relay network, increasing the orphan rate for miners significantly, and unnecessarily, during attacks. Again, increasing the minrelaytxfee setting doesn't have this issue, which is what much of the hashing power has already done.

There is a big difference between accepting a transaction instantly from a UI point of view, and actually relying on first-seen mempools to not get ripped off, and finally, needing them to avoid getting ripped off.
Like I said, in examples where double-spending is profitable for the attacker and other security measures aren't available or are ineffective, it's very hard to find people still accepting unconfirmed transactions. For example just look at ATM's, where I've yet to meet an operator that hasn't either turned off zeroconf acceptance, or installed security cameras/strong KYC. Equally "using Bitcoin to buy things" is a very niche activity...
Have you actually ever tried attacking zeroconf? It's remarkably easy - the "300 double-spends attempts in a row" you referred too was an experiment by myself specifically designed to *fail* unless miners had adopted a specific version of RBF that I wanted to measure adoption on.

The problem is in Bitcoin you have an incentive to propagate blocks you find to just 30% of the hashing power, not more than that. This is true in the short term if fees are the main source of income, and true in the long run if you want to gain market share and thus long term profitability. The reason is once you find a block you and people who have that block are *two* blocks ahead of everyone else; at 30% you're side is more likely to get even further ahead than the other side is to find two blocks in a row.
IBLT if you have plenty of bandwidth and your smaller competitors don't is just helping them at your own expens., Lots of things naturally sabotage IBLT because it only works well if mempools across the network are tightly coordinated; very easy to disrupt that coordination.

I'm a security engineer, thinking about how things could be exploited is what we do.
Making it easier to *think* you're running a full node when you actually aren't isn't a good thing. For instance, in many proposals for how to use UTXO commitments if miners decided to create Bitcoins out of thin air after a few days everyones' software would accept the new chain even though it violated the rules in the past. Right now it pretty clearly results in the invalid chain being rejected; if it doesn't clearly result in the invalid chain being rejected we call into question the value of a Bitcoin. That's not a good thing.

The root cause here is that when people say Bitcoin is slow, they are either ignorant, or lying to you.
Bitcoin is becoming *expensive* because of very high demand. If you can afford it, you can use Bitcoin just like you always could; if you can't afford it, at some point you can't use Bitcoin at all for your use-case. In between you might have to change how you use Bitcoin to use it more efficiently - last I checked Coinbase does two transactions for every transaction for dumb internal accounting reasons, and I'm sure we'll see them stop doing that soon.
The thing about this "Bitcoin is getting slow" narrative, is it's designed to make it sound like Bitcoin is becoming unusable for *everyone*, which just isn't true. Rather, the real story is a bunch of people using Bitcoin for less use-cases that are less-valuable on a per-tx basis are being forced out of the market. This isn't unusual - lobster used to be so cheap people used it to fertilize their gardens, but now it's far to valuable to use for such trivial reasons. Instead, we've used better technology to substitute fertilizers like lobster with cheaper options. Similarly, in Bitcoin we're seeing globally broadcast on-chain transactions being substituted with more efficient payment channel schemes.

Banks are much more interested in privacy than you realize...
My experience doing consulting work for them is that they're very interested in making blockchains more private, precisely because it lets them avoid regulatory pressure. For example, a bank located in Russia might be unable to avoid Russian regulatory attention, but by implementing good privacy features on their fintech they can avoid regulators in the US from getting that data.
Just look at R3's Corda as an example: they're going to great lengths to ensure everything on the system is as private as possible by default. It's not a very *clever* implementation - Mike Hearn's relying on trusted hardware, Intel SGX - but they're definitely trying. I know R3 and the banks funding it were very excited by my Proofchains work - which lead to Corda's overall architecture - when I pointed out how it'd let you only reveal transaction history to participants, hiding it from the public.
It shouldn't surprise anyone that banks would be interested in Blockstream's technologies along these lines, such as confidential transactions. I personally expect to use them in the future myself for fintech-related work.
As for Jeff Garzik's company... here's what Chairman and Co-founder Matthew Roszak had to say:

It's a from-scratch rewrite of the Bitcoin codebase, yet what's actually different is just the ring signature code.

Unfortunately they can't do that reliably, because there's no good way of guaranteeing they'll actually know of the most hashpower chain, especially when there's a significant number of blocks being produced on a different chain.
Anyway, as I mentioned elsewhere in that thread, obviously the segwit2x designers aren't completely confident they would get the majority hashing power, because they choose to use anti-wipeout protection in case they don't. I don't blame them one bit: lots of things can change in three months.

Actually it's pretty hard to find businesses that rely on unconfirmed transactions; even in cases where the risk is negligable because either the thing they're selling has basically zero marginal cost - digital downloads - or they have your identity anyway - exchanges - businesses tend to require at least one confirmation.


I know of an attack against a satoshidice-style site where it appeared that someone had actually managed to sybil attack a reasonably large mining pool to get their double-spends mined - that's a lot of work! Equally, I was contacted by an ATM operator who had lost enough money - five figures - that they asked me to keep all details confidential because the police had been involved and they didn't want the investigation compromised.
One of my worries these days is that people new to the space just don't find out about attacks, because there's often reluctance for the people getting attacked to go public with the details for various reasons.

32MiB blocks could have easily killed Bitcoin in the early days had people spammed the blockchain.

...and the key thing with that is being able to control what nodes a node connects to can be a very powerful tool to attack new nodes, as it lets you prevent a node from learning about the valid chain with the most work. There's also a privacy issue: while DNS seeders tries to take advantage of caching for privacy, it's far from perfect... and with this change, all but one of the seeds would be run by companies - like Jeff Garzik's Bloq - who are part of the Blockchain Alliance, which does pre-emptive KYC/AML sharing of customer data with law enforcement.

You're completely wrong here. The reason this meme keeps getting popularity is because blockchain.info made a major security fuckup that made using their wallet anywhere at all extremely dangerous; Tor exit nodes just happened to be the most common way it was exploited.
The .onion address endpoint that Coinkite is letting you use is actually *more* secure than SSL because the encryption can't be compromised by bad certificate authorities, and the privacy makes it hard for hackers to find the end points. It's actually common for smart sysadmins to setup systems where API access and SSH access goes through Tor onion sites as a security and anti-DoS mechanism - exactly what Coinkite is doing here. Similarly using Tor for outgoing Bitcoin Core connections is really important, especially when you're operating a business that is doing transactions on behalf of others.

BIP-91 lock-in does not guarantee segwit will be activated unless BIP-91 is actually enforced.
Soft-forks are ultimately enforced by users, not miners, and right now practically no users are running BIP-91 enforcing nodes like [segsignal]( So a majority of miners can reneg on BIP-91, fail to activate segwit, and get away without any long-term¹ consequences because the BIP-91 invalid blocks they would be producing are considered to be perfectly valid by the vast majority of users' nodes.
Will this happen? It's notable that even though BIP-91 just activated - something which is supposed to signal clear intent to activate segwit - a bit less than a majority of miners are actually signaling segwit. While no smoking gun, it's a sign that we *may* be in a situation where a majority of miners do not intend to actually activate segwit.
I don't think this is the most likely outcome - there's other pressures like social that probably would serve to enforce BIP-91 - but I'd give it significant odds of happening. Maybe 25%?
edit: FWIW, the reason why I think it's as high a chance as 25% is because there's a few ways to reneg on segwit with plausible deniability. For instance, miners could "accidentally" mine a bunch of BIP-91 invalid blocks - e.g. claiming it was due to validationless spy-mining - and then decide not to reorg out those blocks. At that point, the BIP-91 rules have been broken, but lots of transactions depend on them, so the whole thing gets called off with vague mutterings of "we'll try again once we upgrade our systems" or "well obviously soft-forks are just too dangerous!"
1) In the short-term reneging on BIP-91 could lead to a large reorg - why I recommend that people be *very* cautious about trusting confirmations until segwit is fully activated in (hopefully) a few weeks. It's quite plausible that we'll see even 6+ confirmed transactions get double-spent due to reorgs. Now, that doesn't mean it's *likely*, but if a double-spent transaction would be a devastating loss, you should be very cautious. Of course, often a double-spend isn't devastating: if I'm selling a house I know who is buying it, a double-spend will land them in jail, so I'm not relying solely on Bitcoin confirmations to protect me.
@_date: 2015-02-05 14:05:35
No. The version bump is just a way for miners to let others know they've changed the rules. Soft-forks can easily be done in secret, e.g. to implement coin blacklists.

Yes, about a year ago IIRC. If you really want I'll dig up the quote, but it's obvious why it's important:
It's not much of a problem when running a full node is a trivial thing that anyone can do with little effort; it's a problem when running a full node is something not many people do; it's a huge problem when getting the data required to validate the blockchain fully isn't trivial. (e.g. having to download 86GB just to validate the past *month* of transactions to make sure miners are following the rules)
You know, I just got home from a 3 week trip, and it still took my node a good half hour to sync up; it'd have just barely gotten started if the blocksize was 20MB, let alone the *much higher* amount it'll be soon after with your double every two years plan.
It's very easy to force a rule change when people can't reasonably check the rules are being followed.

I think the cryptocurrency anonymity crowd rejects Tor at their peril. The tradeoffs Tor makes with regard to centralization are pretty fundemental; I2P for example picks different tradeoffs which make it inherently vulnerable to sybil attacks in ways that Tor isn't. With regard to US Government funding, I think the Tor community is well aware it's an issue and wants to move away from that as much as possible, but their fundraising efforts just haven't been succesfull enough.
I personally know many of the people behind Tor and find them to be the most competent security and privacy engineers I know, and they do it for practically no money. While it's even likely that one or two people involved in the project are government agents, the organizational structure of Tor takes that into account - they know damn well that there's intense efforts to infiltrate Tor and behave appropriately, creating systems that don't rely on any one person as much as possible.

No, because when Satoshi reduced the blocksize limit to 1MB there had never been a &gt;1MB block, so the reduction was a soft-fork that applied for all of history, not just blocks after that date.

What jgarzik tried to push was something that was gratuitously incompatible with segwit, and wouldn't have served to activate segwit.

And as it is, most miners are probably running Jame's [segsignal]( right now rather than btc1, as the latter has been affected by a number of bugs.

In short, yes. How strong? Depends on what protocol is being used for the timestamp - e.g. publishing a hash in the New York times is very strong, but pretty annoying to verify, while many trusted signature-based timestamps are somewhat weak, but easy to veryify. Bitcoin is the best of both worlds.

But miners who are larger are affected by this problem much less as they'll never orphan their own blocks, yet they also have lower costs per btc of revenue as you only need to run a single node no matter what your hashing power.
Basically once you get your block propagated to more than ~30% of the hashing power, if your goal is to find more blocks than the competition you have no incentive to try harder - you're just helping out the competition after that point.

The interesting question isn't what is the right block size, because that's *way* too dependent on day-to-day circumstance, including threats that we often don't even know about. The interesting question is what's the right way to scale up Bitcoin, and achieving that by scaling the blocksize directly very obviously gets you very little other than short-term gains at high cost and risk.
Scaling up Bitcoin by increasing the blocksize is like removing the pillers holding up the roof in a coal mine to get another 50% more coal: it works for awhile, then the roof collapses in on you unexpectedly. Meanwhile the smart guys were outside the whole time inventing better ways to mine.

That's kinda the point of prefix filtering... Something I keep hearing from academics studying Bloom filters is they're frustrated how such a simple problem was implemented in such a bad way with so little privacy. Tweaking bloom filters to have half-decent privacy isn't that hard, and if you want the resulting data structure to be compatible with future (U)TXO commitment schemes you end up with prefix filters.
Sure, PIR would be nice, but we can already do much better with relatively little work - precisely why Electrum and DarkWallet are implementing prefix filters for TXO and UTXO lookup.

Electrum *is* SPV, just not using the same protocol to talk to the server as Bitcoinj; Bitcoinj's server is Bitcoin Core.
SPV refers to how transactions are verified, not how the wallet gets the data for those transactions. The real difference is the security model: in Electrum you know who you're trusting because you connect to specific servers, while in Bitcoinj you connect to servers whose owners are unknown, and because Bitcoinj relies heavily on the DNS seeds, you *also* have a single point of failure. In either case you *are* still trusting those servers not to attack you, for instance by hiding transaction data from you, or violating your privacy.

Which is pretty much infeasible with the 20MB+ blocks he's proposing - even just syncing up a month worth of blocks is 87GB and a year just over 1TB. What's actually been proposed is you verify part of the blockchain yourself, and just trust that the rest was mined honestly. Although if we don't implement UTXO set commitments first, you'll have to get the UTXO set from a trusted source, a source that can blacklist coins undetectably. Or may be forced too if governments decide distributing illegal data in the UTXO set is a crime. (Mike Hearn advocated we blacklist UTXO's in that scenario back when someone uploaded the child porn sections of the Hidden Wiki to the blockchain)
All this has the additional hazard that the UTXO set can grow up to as fast as the blockchain size itself. Right now the usage pattern is such that it's growing a fair bit slower, but than can change rapidly depending on what people use the blockchain for. Equally if we *do* implement UTXO set commitments, it becomes very attractive to use the blockchain as a massive key-value database for all kinds of stuff. This is why I've proposed we have a fixed-size UTXO set, and use TXO commitments to spend old coins, but that in turn uses significantly more bandwidth to spend txouts that have been dropped from the UTXO set, which puts bandwidth constrained miners at a big disadvantage. (and TXO commitments also turn the blockchain into a key-value store, albeit a less useful one)
As you can see, everything you change here involves trading off resistance to attack and robustness against unforseen problems in exchange for being able to scale up in the most naive possible way.

PGP is a transferable proof as well, which again, is dangerous for the ecosystem; I would strongly oppose _any_ BIP that is designed to prove who sent funds in a transferable way. Equally, notice how stealth addresses - as an example - was specifically designed such that a by default a receiver isn't generating a transferable proof of ownership for a specific txout.
What's very likely to happen is these transferable proofs will be incorporated into databases kept by anti-privacy companies like Chainalysis.

What exact scenarios do you think this would actually be useful in? It's already really easy in many circumstances to confirm bank transfers; the email money transfer system here in Canada sends an immediate email to the recipient. The hard part is dealing with the fact that the banking system is designed to be reversible; no amount of TLS Notary magic can prevent the other party from reversing the transaction after the fact.
You also missed a use-case: prove a bank balance is what you claim it to be for proof-of-solvency applications. (though this is definitely less useful as fiat is far more subject to debt claims and crypto currencies in that it can be frozen easily by third-parties)
@_date: 2015-02-05 19:46:10
That's a totally impractical answer as you need relay nodes to reliably get transactions to miners. If those nodes relay transactions that miners don't mine, then the whole network is vulnerable to DoS attacks, among other things. Thus the default setting of 40 bytes in v0.10rc4 is the practical limit on OP_RETURN size.

Again, you're wrong here.
In the case where you just use Coinkites API a .onion address-using API service provides you with the same encryption protections as SSL, better assurance you're actually connecting to the right server because .onion addresses are self-authenticating (they're the hash of a RSA key) and you prevent attackers from finding out where your servers are and attacking them. It's safer in every way.

Looks like they just merged mandatory replay protection as a standardness rule: 
I personally would have done it as an actual consensus rule - as a standardness rule miners can still maliciously mine transactions intended for the other chain - but I think it's worth giving credit for a strong move in the right direction. This is far better than how Garzik has completely left off replay protection from his 2x hardfork.

Actually, my criticism is a bit more subtle than that.
Electronic voting is a *very* well studied problem in cryptography; it's practically a cliche to be working on the problem. Systems like Helios already provide excellent transparency, auditability, privacy, etc. etc. and they don't need blockchains to do it. So when Bitcoin enthusists keep on suggesting "lets vote on the blockchain!!!!" naturally the crypto community rolls their eyes - the problems the Bitcoin people are trying to solve have already been solved.
*Except* the ability to treat the right to vote as a token and transfer it around the blockchain securely. Usually though cryptographers have the opposite requirement - trying to prevent people from selling their vote for cash - so by tweeting "the only new thing the blockchain brings to voting tech is the ability to securely sell my vote" I'm quite delibrately making fun of the Bitcoin enthusiasts pushing blockchain voting.
Anyway, that the foundation is replacing the excellent and peer-reviewed Helios Voting system for the non-peer-reviewed Swarm scheme "because Bitcoin" is just stupid and strongly indicates the people in charge there don't understand cryptography.

It was, but actually these days we're pretty confident we understanding the scripting system well enough that those kinds of bugs are pretty much all gone.
The main purposes of IsStandard() now - especially the remaining rules for P2SH scripts - is protect *miners* from mining something that will either be unprofitable for them due to excessive sigops or risk getting them forked if the network upgrades, and finally to avoid having people malleate transactions using the "100% standard" script forms like spending pay-to-pubkey-hash and multisig outputs.
There is also the purpose of protecting the network from various forms of spamming, but there isn't consensus that using IsStandard() rules for that is a good idea.

There's no mechanism (currently) for relay nodes to find like-minded peers; if everyone configured their own policies Bitcoin literally wouldn't work for anything but least-common-denominator of transactions, and on top of that, would be vulnerable to DoS attacks.

Agreed! This is a perfect example of a codebase that has significant improvements over the status quo, improvements significant enough to on their own drive adoption regardless of license. So you might as well do the capitalistic thing and make sure you get something in return for all your hard work: other peoples' improvements on the codebase. I personally used AGPL myself for the [server part]( of my OpenTimestamps software for kinda similar reasons: worldwide there'd likely only be a few dozen to few hundred servers anyway, making wide adoption irrelevant (the Python client library that verified timestamps was LGPL).
Bitcoin Core itself is an entirely different situation: adoption is more valuable to the devs than getting code contributions back, so using a permissive license makes sense (apparently RMS has even said this publicly; if someone wants to dig up the quote that'd be awesome!).

As the desired outcome is segwit activation, I think you can make a good argument for switching to BIP148 over segsignal.
Though it's a case-by-case basis. I'll be leaving the OpenTimestamps calendars on stock Bitcoin Core, as in the event of a failure it'll be easier to fix if they fail in a way that's consistent with the majority of Bitcoin nodes. But like I say, that's case-by-case thinking.

It's my view that the Bitcoin Core BIPs should be explicitly labeled as endorsed by the Bitcoin Core team; trying to pretend that BIPs aren't permissioned while refusing to issue BIP  for things we find distasteful is stupid.

Off chain is irrelevant - the problem is BIP75 provides transferable proof, which can be passed to third parties and verified by them.

Remember that you can (almost!) always split up a single large payment into many small ones that happen sequentially; if you send a dollar by sending 100 pennies the most that can be stolen by the hub is just a penny.

Unfortunately depending on how the system is setup that doesn't mean anything.
If they're using a good, secure system, the logic database, trading logic, and wallet, are separated from the website itself. This means that the website can be hacked without making it possible to steal coins, yet the moment users login they'll input the necessary credentials to gain access to their coins. Since the attacker has control of the website, that lets them in turn give the wallet the right authorization to move the money and send it to the attacker.

You can either designate one or more people/organizations to make those decisions, like saying "Wikipedia can declare someone a spammer" or "If three of Wikipedia, Reddit, Slashdot, etc. etc. say someone is a spammer they are"
The other option is to do it by economic measures. Basically *everyone* in the system buys these proof-of-sacrifice [fidelity bonds]( and both positive and negative ratings are weighted according to how many Bitcoin's have been sacrificed for the identities involved.
The later leads to some subtleties: you can always create sock-puppets to rate your posts as non-abusive, or someone elses abusive, so you should make people able to spend whatever amount they want to boost their identity. Not doing so leads to strange effects. Similarly the mechanism has to be carefully designed to be linear: you want buying trust to be exactly as effectively has buying sockpuppet identities. On the other hand, doing all this with direct economic logic may be decentralized, but it also means someone with enough money can always grief you. But that's just how the world works...

Yes, merge-mining is really, really dangerous because it lets miners who want to attack your consensus system do so for free. Without &gt;50% support you're in danger; IIRC BTC Guild is in a position where they could destroy namecoin singlehandedly at no cost to themselves.

I agree with you: Tor is still sufficiently technical that many non-technical users can't use it safely.
But so far the only technology we have for those users is centrally managed naming systems with trusted third parties; decentralised key/value mappings aren't going to help those users due to squatting, as I've argued elsewhere. If anything, it'll make it more likely for those users to be harmed due to the false sense of ease of use.

Those aren't soft-forks - they're 51% attacks. The key difference is unlike a soft-fork, a firm-fork requires users to opt into the new system; from the point of view of someone who doesn't choose to support the system, they've been 51% attacked and can no longer transact until the attack stops.
This has significant economic implications, as in a firm-fork there's a high chance users won't choose to adopt the new system, and thus won't buy the new currency miners have chosen to mine. Exactly the same outcome as in a hard fork, but with a 51% attack on top of it that ensures users of the existing system can't transact at all.
This is why I think the ethics of firm-forks are extremely dubious - I personally would probably never be willing to participate in the development of one.

Previous versions of Bitcoin could be tricked into not even sending an empty block header in that case; at least with an empty block header theere is *some* bandwidth cost to the attacker. I personally used this flaw to DoS nodes to determine the extent of the problem and found you could cause most nodes - any without either enough RAM to cache the whole blockchain, or a fast SSD drive - to fall out of sync with the rest of the network by multiple blocks. An attack against the entire Bitcoin network could have been done over Tor with just a dozen rented EC2 instances. (I actually tried that, and turned it off after a few minutes because the results were effective enough to be downright frightening)
With the change to at least send headers it's a harder attack to pull off, but not that much harder.
FWIW the idea of even making it possible to disable bloom filters as an emergency measure, or for full nodes to chose to other serve other full nodes, is strongly opposed by Gavin and Mike Hearn, although all the other core devs support it:  Normally I wouldn't be talking about exploits in public like this, but it's been known about long enough that it should have been fixed already. The only reason it and similar DoS atacks haven't is because of the politics around SPV nodes.

I worked with an exchange awhile back to get them on the right track towards doing exactly this. It's a fair bit of work - you essentially end up with two parallel software stacks for your exchange - but the security is worth it.
For transfers to/from the exchange itself, the key thing is figuring out how to authenticate customer intent in multiple says. For instance, send the customer an SMS and have side of the exchange authenticate via the website interface, and the other through an SMS code. Similarly, be very careful in how you authenticate withdrawal addresses to ensure the money being withdrawn actually goes to your customers, not hackers.

The standard argument that miners *wouldn't* adopt replace-by-fee has always been that by doing so they would make Bitcoin less valuable and thus damage the value of the coins they mine. When I first proposed replace-by-fee I argued that we shouldn't make assumptions that miners have long-term profit on their mind, only short term. (just look at how many people sent money to ASICMINER even when they weren't shipping hardware and risked 51%-ing the network)
With replace-by-fee you can align both long-term and short-term interests. Of course zero-conf will still never be as safe as one or more confirms, but attacks that are unprofitable on average are far less of a concern than profitable ones.
The other issue is that replace-by-fee makes the fee system in Bitcoin work significantly better: if your fee turns out to be too small and your transaction isn't getting mined, just broadcast another one with a higher fee. It's the difference between an auction where you only get one chance to bid and one that lets you try again. Replace-by-fee also makes it easy to implement certain types of trust-free mixing protocols to make your coins more anonymous.

Off-chain is just one idea; the state of crypto-coin theory has advanced even further in the past few months to the point where it looks like with some (significant) changes to how Bitcoin works you could make a scalable blockchain for any number of transactions... kinda.
Problem is you're quite correct that like it or not bandwidth costs money, and that money has to come from somewhere. My gut feeling is you'll wind up with a system with multiple tiers, with the lowest-value transactions wind up with fundementally less security than the highest value.
Also, Gavin doesn't know what he's talking about frankly. The idea of ASIC miners built into heaters is nice and all, but that's not mining, that's *hashing* - the control is still in a central pool. Unfortunately Bitcoin has some pretty fundemental incentives towards centralization - larger pools *are* more profitable per unit hashing power for both the pool operator and the hashers than small ones - and removing blocksize limits just makes those incentives even worse.
What would be best if people admitted that the path forward is frankly unknown, and encouraged people to study the issue; saying even that "The design we're heading toward is that there won't be any limit, but by default miners will refuse to process blocks that are ridiculously big." is dishonest and/or ignorant. What is correct is to say that rough consensus is that pure-off-chain solutions have a lot of problems, and that the limit should be *increased* somehow, *eventually*. But equally that same rough consensus is that we have no idea how to determine that increase, and there's almost total consensus among people who actually study this stuff that leaving it up to miners is a really bad idea because of the awful incentives it creates for large pools.

Nope, I wasn't doing concurrent transmission at all. Rather, I was doing something even dumber: I was double-spending simply by broadcasting again with a higher fee, well after the first transaction was broadcast.
What my tests showed is that in spite of all the hysteria about zeroconf, wallet authors were making nearly zero effort to protect users' from doublespends. So little effort in fact, that even after a doublespend had confirmed and the user had been ripped off for sure, many of the wallets tested wouldn't even warn the user this had happened.

It's pretty simple really. On the legal side of things, people are asking the foundation to put working with regulators on their agenda.
On the technical side of things, the foundation pays the salary of Gavin, who's vision for Bitcoin in the future is that scalability will be addressed in a way that will mean you can't run a Bitcoin node anonymously, and will need expensive datacenters to do so. The foundation is also apparently unwilling to fund development of technology like trust-free mixing that can help you transact anonymously.

The segwit transactions aren't malleable from the point of view of your wallet and consensus code; the data used to transmit them between nodes is malleable from the point of view of the mempool.
Ironically, the problem stems from the fact that segwit transactions _aren't_ malleable: the p2p networking code refers to transactions by the unchangable txid, which is a problem when someone can give you an invalid transaction - due to a corrupted witness - with the same txid as a valid one.
However, because this isn't related to consensus, this type of malleability can only be used as a nuisance DoS attack to temporarily prevent a transaction from relaying; once in the blockchain there's no issue.

A lot of stuff was done behind the scenes to fix some DDoS vulnerabilities in the way SPV nodes and bloom filters work; something has in fact been done about it.
The attack on SPV nodes was in that they give very little privacy and can easily wind up reveiling the contents of your wallet. jdillon and I figured it'd be worthwhile, and most ethical, to put up a fake website claiming to be a company running many different Bitcoin nodes and explaining how that would let them get data to track who owned what coins - something blockchain.info already does to an extent. It'd be a good warning to the community that we need better privacy protections in Bitcoin wallets given that someone probably will do this for real sooner or later.

It also reduces the *size* of transactions too. Every transaction includes a transaction header, so if two parties get together for a transaction they were going to do anyway, they get to share that header and hence save a bit on transaction fees.

It's pretty bad.
For example Satoshi put every bit of functionality to one single program. At one point he was even trying to put a whole eBay-style auction system into the Bitcoin client. That lack of modularity has caused a lot of problems for us developers and the long term goal is to split out the core chain verification functionality from everything else.
Another big flaw was the scripting system. While the idea was a good one the actual functionality implemented was on the one hand quite extensive, but it's missing the parts needed to make it actually useful. So we've been left with this really complex system that every Bitcoin implementation must get *exactly* right, yet it's still missing the parts that would make it actually useful. It's a really frustrating situation to be in for developers.
Satoshi did a good job avoiding buffer overruns and stuff like that, but doing so with modern languages isn't hard. Bitcoin is written with C++ using the boost library and just doesn't do pointer manipulation anywhere. On the other hand, Bitcoin did have a lot of security flaws related to DoS attacks, flaws that have taken years to track down one by one.
Personally I figure Satoshi had one really good idea, the proof-of-work blockchain, but he's still human like the rest of us, and just like the rest of us he made a lot of mistakes too. To me what's remarkable about Bitcoin is how many people could have done it; if anything it shows how even if you *aren't* a brilliant rockstar developer, if you have that one revolutionary idea, you too can change the world.

You haven't come out any worse, but you also haven't come out any *better*.
For most transactions we've already got pretty decent social incentives not to steal - if you can turn profitable theft into unprofitable vandalism you've made a huge improvement to the situation. In most cases I fully believe that's enough to edge things over to the point where the remaining vandalism is minor cost; the minority of cases where it isn't there are some extensions to replace-by-fee that can be used too.
The alternative, sticking with the current system's defacto "first-tx-seen" policy just gives too many incentives to attack the network. If it worked, it'd be ok, but the reality is it's just too insecure to be practical. People used to like to argue that "zeroconf was fine, where's the attacks?", but sure enough we're starting to see those attacks happen, and in reality there are *very* few merchants out there who do their business in such a way that they were vulnerable in the first place.

FWIW in my discussions with other Bitcoin developers a space to test out controversial or risky features is welcomed - Gavin's view appears to be the minority. To date unfortunately that has not been the case - most alt-coins really have been "scamcoins" - but lately Litecoin has been getting attention from competent people. Myself I did an audit for Litecoin's 0.8.x release, and interestingly that has lead to me recommending that Litecoin disable bloom filtering temporarily while some vulnerabilities to DoS attacks are fixed and the way traffic is prioritized is rethought. Meanwhile on the Bitcoin side of things the path forward is fairly controversial:  and 
It hasn't fully happened yet, but it would be fascinating if Litecoin and Bitcoin ended up with different countermeasures and thus an opportunity to compare and contrast their effectiveness. The two currencies already have different anti-transaction spam strategies.
The Litecoin community may disagree, but myself I don't see the second most popular crypto-currency, whatever it may be, ever gaining a significant fraction of the most popular's market share. (more than 15% or so) But I do see a lot of value in a space to explore alternatives, and it's healthy for people in the community to recognize that they don't have a monopoly on either investors, merchants, or developers.
tl;dr: So what if you're coins are worth 15% less? Be glad they aren't worth 0% because of stagnation and complacency.

The dangerous thing about the "orphan cost" is that if it's a significant factor in mining profitability it will be an enormous incentive towards centralized mining pools - a miner will never orphan themselves, so if you have, say, 50% of the hashing power you are affected by orphans far less than a miner with 1%
The last thing Bitcoin needs is a strong structural reason for big pools to be significantly more profitable than small ones.
@_date: 2013-10-28 03:06:40
FWIW This is old news – one of the reasons 0.8.5 was released was to make a specific DoS attack more expensive to the attacker in terms of bandwidth.
The root issue with all this stuff is that to support Simplified Verification Nodes (SPV) the reference implementation allows peers to connect that don’t do any useful work for the network. On the other hand, SPV clients like Android Wallets can’t contribute back to the network in any meaningful way. This allowed for an attack called the Bloom IO attack, where an attacker uses the bloom filter feature to get Bitcoin nodes to use a lot of disk IO while the attacker uses almost no resources at all.
Better prioritization can fix the issue in the sense that the whole Bitcoin network won’t collapse, but there’s little we can do to prevent an attacker making SPV clients useless, other than making them pay for their services in some way. There’s been lots of discussion about how to do that, but it’s mired in controversy because many don’t want to make it harder to use liteweight clients.
@_date: 2013-05-31 19:03:06
P2Pool is a great idea, but it doesn't work for every situation and is relatively inflexible. For instance it requires a lot of bandwidth to run, it's has higher variance than pools, (and that variance will just get higher as the hashing rate goes up) and requires a low latency network connection and low latency mining hardware due to the 10 second share block time.

Mining will probably become again lucrative for the smart common person as ASICs mature, power costs dominate and difficulty growth slows. You and I can use mining equipment to heat our homes, heat our water etc. while large-scale mining operations have a much harder time doing anything with that waste heat.

In some ways this is better than expected: they have ways to attack Tor, but it's hard, they have a hard time even targeting individuals so long as they have decent computer security, and they don't have the ability to do surveillance en-mass yet. And no, they don't run all the Tor nodes, yet. (but the GCHQ runs some of them)
Unfortunately there is an existential risk here: the NSA may have incentives to keep the fact that they have the ability to disrupt/hack Tor 100% secret, which could very well be a situation where they'd rather *not* discredit Tor by risking getting caught running all the Tor nodes. After all, the US government developed Tor because they thought it'd be useful for them too. Now that it's public that they do have some capabilities, it might be the case that they will be more willing to attack Tor in ways that could make it completely useless and/or untrustworthy, like being the operator of the majority of Tor nodes.
edit: People should be totally clear on this though: the NSA does have the capability, if they choose too, to run a sufficient number of fake Tor nodes to compromise Tor 100%. There's just not very much we can do about that as long as you can run a node on your own, and even if they did vet node operators that doesn't raise the bar all that much. Fortunately it sounds like they aren't willing to go that far, yet.

Actually the issue isn't as bad as you'd think: you can announce a nLockTime transaction in advance, before it becomes possible to mine, by including it into the blockchain as data so that everyone knows the transaction exists. There's a minor cost to doing so - effectively you are paying the transaction fee twice - but that cost is what prevents DoS attacks. In addition because it's in the chain for good you don't run into issues of accidentally losing the transaction; having to backup your wallet immediately after doing certain things is very user-unfriendly and can easily lead to disasters.
My announce/commit sacrifice scheme works this way basically. The main problem with all this stuff is it's inconvenient to get data into the blockchain, and you really want exactly one standard for everyone to use.

I think this is why we get people calling bitcoin 'alien code' and other sillyness. They do a cursory look at the code, see that pretty good practices are being followed and the stupid mistakes aren't being made, but fail to realize how many architectural flaws there are because they don't understand how all the parts fit together.
From Satoshi's emails and the timing of them I have a strong suspicion that he was a student rushing to finish Bitcoin before classes resumed in January. For instance, it appears that even as late as November he still hadn't decided if transaction fees would be included.
Don't forget that Bitcoin was originally released windows-only. Sorry, but that's just not a sign of solid code.

A real-world example of multi-sig being used is Gregory Maxwell's CoinJoin fund: 
Though not an escrow, the mechanism is the same: the funds are stored in a address that requires 2-of-3 signatures from him, sipa, and theymos to spend funds. That is, of those three people, two have to co-operate.
One sticking point is that the 2-year-old P2SH standard isn't supported yet by bitcoinj, so Android Wallets and a bunch of other wallets can't yet pay to escrows or multisig-protected addresses like the above. (3M8XGFBKwkf7miBzpkU3x2DoWwAVrD1mhk)
Sure, eventually the payment protocol and other stuff will reduce the need for addresses all together, but in the meantime making it possible to pay to P2SH addresses immediately would really help people trying to start experimenting with escrow services and 2-factor-protected wallets. Not to mention dispel the myth that those features aren't supported by the Bitcoin network.

Basically it looks like it is possible split the blockchain into parts in such a way that security and consensus can be achieved by validating subsets of it. A really simple toy example is my idea of a ring of mutually verifying blockchains: 
Basically miners would mine "pairs" of "adjacent" chains, and to pay someone whose address is in a different chain you would move the coins around the ring, one chain at a time, until they were in the right chain. More complex topologies could be made where the "distance" between any pair of chains is either 1, or scales by log(n) The point of all of it is that any one chain contains no more data than can be easily verified, at the cost of it sometimes taking longer to pay someone. (but keep in mind the block interval could be raised, because there is less data, and there's always a lot of uncertainty involved in how long a transaction will confirm anyway - mining is probabalistic)
Other ideas have focused on making it possible for groups of mutually co-operating, but ideally trust-free, nodes to collaboratively create blocks in such a way that no single node has to have more than a small amount of bandwidth available. Again, this requires changes to how blocks are structured, although that kind of idea may be possible to retro-fit into Bitcoin relatively easily.
There can be also trade-offs between cost and security: for instance it'll never be possible to make an unlimited number of transactions - the world is finite. So you might have a crypto-coin system with multiple blockchains, one for each power-of-two valued coin. For instance 1 satoshi, 2 satoshis, 4 satoshis, 8, 16, 32 etc. This means you can always pay someone an exact amount, but due to the low profit involved the less valuable chains will have less hashing power keeping them secure, and fewer nodes keeping a copy of the data. It might be the case that the 1 satoshi chain is horribly insecure, but the 32-billion satoshi chain is rock solid.
Obviously we're talking about a lot of far off ideas, but pie-in-the-sky research has a way of becoming reality over time.

They absolutely could do that - the end result would look not dissimilar to the alt-coins that have implemented fine-grained centralized checkpoints.
Having said that once you do have a central authority who guarantees all transactions there's no reason to go with Bitcoin's design - every node knows about every transaction - given the atrocious scalability that it has. It would make far more sense for everyone but that central authority to use clients based on the Electrum protocol or SPV protocol and just have the central authority run the servers those clients talk too.

We're on the same page for sure, sounds just like what I proposed a few weeks ago: 
Do read the caveats at the end though! The bit about miners being able to use proof-of-propagation to cheat actually verifying anything is an ugly issue, although one that exists in a number of forms. I'm also not totally sure that miners have strong incentives to actually do it, though frankly, weak incentives aren't so bad either!
Note that when mining at a pool using Luke-Jr's getblocktemplate stuff *any* miner lucky enough to find a near proof-of-work can create a proof-of-propagation from the data the block template gives the miner. Similarly any p2pool miner can create one.
In any case, tx replacement is the important thing right now; propagation proofs are a cool use of crypto, but they can wait.

If you look at the hash rate graph releasing it on Windows-only seems to have had the opposite effect; his initial audience was much more likely to be comfortable with Linux and Bitcoin remained stagnent for almost a year. UNIX build support was added [Nov 5th 2009]( and it's only after that date that the hashrate started to climb. Version 0.2 was released shortly after on Dec 16th, which was followed by the start of a significant hash rate climb, and the first non-minimum difficulty on Dec 30th.
Also, as jgarzik mentioned, Bitcoin initially didn't come with an RPC server which make it difficult to actually create businesses using Bitcoin.

It's absolutely possible, and it doesn't have to be a currency per-se. More like the gold standard days when every note was a claim on some amount of gold held by someone else.
Quite simply we can take the banking model where a bank holds some portion of your funds and does transactions, and maintain ledgers of who owns what, on your behalf. But the key thing is unlike traditional banking because it's based on cryptography, and Bitcoin, the auditing can be absolute. It'll be like if your bank was required to make their vaults out of bulletproof glass and allow anyone to wander around them counting the bars. Similarly with cryptography you can create machine-readable proofs of any fraud committed by the bank and distribute them to the world in seconds if the bank ever commits fraud, as well as integrate technologies into Bitcoin itself so that if such fraud is detected the bank automatically loses a bond they've been forced to buy to make fraud economically unprofitable.
I'm working on one such system myself called [fidelity-bonded banking]( More importantly, if we keep the blocksize small enough that anyone can participate fully in Bitcoin as a miner and validating node, you'll be able to use all sorts of similar solutions, not just one.

The payment protocol as specified is basically useless for person-to-person transfers. It is extensible however, and adding OpenPGP support would be quite easy; I wrote about how to do that on bitcointalk.org a week or two ago. Anyway, the whole point of just using the SSL CA infrastructure for version 1.0 is to avoid re-inventing the wheel.
As an aside, one thing I really like about the payment protocol is that by giving attackers monetary incentives, and a single protocol to attack, it'll help highlight weaknesses in the SSL CA infrastructure so they can be fixed. Myself I welcome the fact that we'll see MITM enabled by corrupt and/or incompetent CA providers, as well as poor user interfaces - we need a wakeup in the industry to make the SSL CA infrastructure better and people losing valuable Bitcoins could very well be that wakeup call.

My paper [Disentangling Crypto-Coin Mining: Timestamping, Proof-of-Publication, and Validation]( is worth reading to understand how an embedded consensus system like Mastercoin can function. In short, the fact that miners validate transactions is purely an *optimization* that isn't required for a crypto-currency to work and be secure. There is a cost to that optimization - wallet software can't outsource validation to someone else - but that cost can be made managable, especially for high-value applications. For alt-currencies trying to get started embedding themselves in a stronger currency's blockchain is a very smart decision that gets them all the security the host has from day one.

Making Bitcoin scale via just making the blocksize bigger, while keeping it decentralized, is a lot more theoretical as off-chain transaction are.

That statement diminished my opinion of Dan Kaminsky: I personally have found a number of moderately serious security vulnerabilities in Bitcoin, both implementation-level and design-level, and others have found even more serious ones than me. I wouldn't say the effort I went to to find the vulnerabilities that I have was very significant, so for Kaminsky to say that "he failed" is either an exaggeration, or he didn't actually look all that hard, or he isn't actually all that good at finding them.

It's worth noting how Shamir's paper said there were multiple steps involved between what the paper assumed was the "Founder" and DPR: these steps could have just as easily included a transfer to a big exchange, and from that exchange to the Silk Road by a totally unrelated user.
It's also interesting how this shows how even without privacy protections, people seeking to unmask Bitcoin users are still having a hard time doing it via blockchain analysis.Yet at the same time it shouldn't be any surprise that if you publicly link your address to your identity a simple google search can find it.
*User-definable privacy* is an amazing feature of Bitcoin: sometimes you want privacy, sometimes you want tocryptographically prove to the world a transaction happened. Bitcoin gives you the best of both worlds, whereas conventional banking is the worst of both worlds.

To be exact, there aren't any strict requirements on that consensus.

Nah, never bothered in the end as people seemed to be catching onto the problem, and really, it was low-priority compared to actually doing real work like figuring out how to get CoinJoin adopted. (notice how back then I hadn't come up with the snappy name yet, the thing that seems to have encouraged public interest in the idea more than anything else!)


Beats me. I really hope it was just some misguided authority-loving hacker who thought john's efforts at getting coinjoin and other privacy stuff implemented was a bad thing and he and his family are ok. (he donated a good % of the total coinjoin bounty, and thousands aimed at other efforts) Worst case is this has little to do with Bitcoin, and much more to do with his alleged day job in intelligence - though one good thing is if that is the case, chances are he was careful enough with Tor and what not that they never figured out who is really was, and leaking his emails so publicly was just another way of discouraging future Snowdens... essentially "we can compromise someone as careful as john dillon, so don't even try".
Myself, I'm guessing the former, but these days who knows?
edit: heck, while I'm theorizing, jdillon could have been a sock-puppet setup to discredit others. e.g. by trying to get myself to do things disreputable. Although while he was a bit hot-headed at times, I never felt he was ever trying to get me to do anything I wouldn't want public, other than the odd frank comment. Or hell, if we're going to go full-retard-conspiracy, while you're doing that, get some evidence planted that your target was operating a long-running sock-puppet; I'd joked before with others how curious it was that he seemed to like to go on vacation the same time as me, but only after he found out my schedule...

Regarding the transaction fee estimate code, it's not very well thought out.
tl;dr: Why would you want to be at an auction for something you needed where you got exactly one chance and one chance only to make a bid? There's nothing wrong with making an initial estimate for your first bid to save time of course, but the bottom line is you're going to be able to get a better deal if you can make a low-ball bid first, raising your bid only if required. To do that you need to be able to take that first transaction, and replace it with another with higher fees if required. (paying the same outputs of course!) 
To get into more detail, the problem is it's just an estimate, and for a few reasons that estimate can easily be wrong. Basically Gavin's fee estimation works entirely from blockchain data, so if miners ever accept transactions for reasons other than fees, like some contract to mine transactions for someone else, the estimates get pushed down and your transactions will get stuck. If a transaction does get stuck, there's nothing you can do about it other than wait - no different from now.
There are already miners with such contracts, Eligius for example, and the practice is likely to become more widespread in the future because the payment protocol is designed to allow the shifting of the burden of mining a transaction to the merchant. The only way the merchant can get a transaction confirmed if the customer put a too-low fee is to either respend it, making use of Luke-Jr's child-pays-for-parent code, (not yet included in the reference client) or by using a out-of-band transaction mining contract. The latter is cheaper because you don't have to pay for a wasteful second transaction.
The other issue is that fee estimation can only be done by full clients; the SPV clients that more and more people are using don't have the blockchain data or mempool so they can't make good fee estimates. Gavin's solution is to make full nodes provide SPV clients with estimation services, but there's no way for the client to know if the node is lying - it gives miners incentives to setup lots of nodes that lie about fees, saying they are higher than they really are, or griefers incentives to do the opposite and get people's transactions stuck. Bitcoin is supposed to be as zero-trust as possible...
There are better solutions, the main one is transaction replacement. Basically if your first transaction isn't getting mined, you broadcast a second one that spends at least one of the same inputs (so both can't be mined at once) and pays every output that the first did, plus another change output. (so zeroconf transactions are still "safe") This would work best if combined with proof-of-propagation, which gives you cryptographic proof that your transaction actually got to miners, although that doesn't have to be implemented immediately.
The main disadvantage with transaction replacement is that it will confuse some wallet software, but that same wallet software can get confused by accidental double-spends, transaction malleability, etc. We're better off if people in the ecosystem write robust software frankly rather than making assumptions that aren't actually true.
Interestingly part of Gavins proposal is to make transactions expire from mempool's relatively quickly, and in that case then yeah, just like in replacement the wallet would rebroadcast a different version with a higher fee! So you still need to implement changing transactions, and you also still need to fix wallets so they handle replacements. Only in his version you have to wait until the transaction expires, which is problematic because you've got stuff like misguided people rebroadcasting transactions that they don't own, preventing the expiration from happening. (making expiration permanent is ugly too - what if you're trying to get a transaction paying you mined, and can't change it?)
What we should have is both: fee estimation with replacement so you can replace transactions in the event that the estimate was too low. This helps remove some of the incentive for griefers to play games lying to SPV clients, and it lets people be more aggressive in their bargaining with miners by allowing people willing to wait a little bit the ability to make an initial low-ball bid, and raise it if needed. Again, why limit yourself to one single chance at getting it right?
EDIT: To be clear, I'm talking about replacement where once a transaction pays someone is broadcast, it's never allowed to be replaced by one that doesn't; in other words zero-conf transactions are just as safe as before.

My full reply: 
Something to keep in mind about the proposal is it is very carefully constructed to ensure that miners can't sway the vote. Remember that miners can always decide to decrease the blocksize by just mining small blocks; it's increasing the blocksize that is the issue.
The proposal is very clear that miners can only increase the blocksize by proving to the community that there exist votes to increase it which is why simply doing nothing in the proposal is you voting to keep the status quo. If that weren't the case miners could simply block votes they don't like and force whatever increase they wanted.
If just a few such votes exist representing just a small portion of the Bitcoins in circulation, the maximum blocksize will increase by a very small amount, if a solid consensus exists, the blocksize can increase by as much as the community wants.
Finally the proposal is careful to take "lost coins" into account by making coins that haven't moved in more than 1 year have an increasingly smaller weight in the vote.
It's a solid proposal and a democratic way of making a very tough decision.

That's exactly it. If, say, three roll by and my transaction still hasn't confirmed, I might want to bump the fee and see if it's more attractive that way. (my wallet software might even do this automatically, or equally a merchant who needs to pay people might setup software to do this)

Unfortunately that's not true because P2Pool is unable to payout every person who contributed a share to every block; if they did the coinbase transaction would be filled with tiny dust payments that cost more in fees to redeem than they are worth. Instead P2Pool drops the smallest payments from every block, and randomly picks people to get paid. The total payment if you are a small miner is fair, but the variance is high. As P2Pool grows what is considered "small" increases.

Off-chain is just a general term, not a specific technology.
The Silk Road and Mt. Gox are two really simple examples of off-chain transactions: in both they hold Bitcoins on your behalf, and just record a ledger of how many each account has; note how it's likely that the majority of Bitcoin economic volume is done off-chain already. The trick is developing the crypto to audit these services and automatically punish fraud, along with technologies like trusted hardware to make fraud exceptionally difficult.

Those are ceramic capacitors, which are generally fairly robust, so it's unusual to see a failure like that. They're unpolarized, so it's not something as simple as being put in backwards, and they tend to handle overvoltages reasonably well: 
Potentially it's over-current, specifically too much ripple current, but ceramic caps have extremely low ESR's (essentially their resistance) and the current is higher for the ones closer to the chip that farther away. (the distance decreases current due to the inductance of the traces)
In both cases the failure happened for a chip at the edge, so most it's actually a mechanical failure; putting ceramic capacitors that large that close to the edge of the PCB is really pushing your luck. When they do fail due to mechanical stress often it's a fail short, which in a high-current application like this one could definitely lead to a small explosion and create the large burn marks you see. In addition you're supposed to mount ceramic capacitors parallel to the edge rather than perpendicular: 
Sounds like KNCminer's PCB layout people either don't know what they're doing, or they ran out of board space and decided to take a risk rather than push the schedule back. Though I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and point out that you can buy ceramic capacitors with flexible terminations that can be placed much closer to the edge of a PCB than regular ones, so possibly there's something else going on here.

For what it's worth, the replacement I'm proposing is the zero-conf safe version where a transaction is only allowed to be replaced by another if the replacement's outputs are a strict superset of the original set of outputs. IOW if anyone who was paid by the first transaction is going to be paid the exact same amount in the second. Of course, adding new outputs and inputs is allowed.

Keep in mind the initial stuff that needs to be done to make Bitcoin scalable is actually simple things like using Jeremy Spilman's trust-free micropayment channels to replace many small transactions between two parties with one single one, negotiated dynamically.
Longer term we'll see protocols based not on trust, but on auditing and  punishment, done in provable fashion. While banks currently trust each other because of the legal system, that can be replaced with enforcement of the rules done by punishing offenders, even directly within Bitcoin itself. For instance with some changes to the Bitcoin software you can even go as far as to create bonds whose value is destroyed by anyone who can provide the Bitcoin network with cryptographic proof of fraud.
When the core protocols are working to enforce honest behavior, it's a very different system than banking today, and much more trustworthy. Certainly good enough to trust with my morning coffee fund.

Note that I did some calculations based on some blocksize-vs-orphan-rate stats collected that suggest that pools who accept transactions with fees less than very roughly 0.001BTC/KB (a ~0.00025BTC fee on an average transaction) are actually losing money on every transaction because of the increased orphan rate. Essentially the larger the block, the longer it takes to propagate around the network, and if some else finds another block in the meantime - or found one just before you found yours - you risk losing your block and your 25BTC reward. Note that the stats I'm talking about were collected after sipa added the signature cache.
Really the way Bitcoin should work for miners is not to set a specific block size limit they'll mine - beyond the 1MB hard limit - but rather you should input a chance of orphan per delta KB figure. Then fill your block with transactions from the most profitable to the least, stopping when the % chance * transaction size * transaction fee &lt; all fees + subsidy in the block already. For instance if for some reason you got a series of very high-fee transactions, lets say 25BTC worth for sake of argument, your now losing money if you include any transaction with less than a 0.002BTC/KB fee.
The other interesting thing is that 0.001BTC/KB figure comes from the current network of non-optimal miners: if a significant fraction of miners change to more optimal fee rules the orphan rate will get higher for miners still using non-optimal block allocation.
FWIW P2Pool is interesting because when a P2Pool node finds a block it forwards only a list of transactions in the block; if it knows a peer already has a transaction it leaves it out. Unfortunately doing this on the network as a whole is problematic: among other things it sets up weird incentives for larger pools - who have lower orphan rates because they'll never orphan themselves and can cheaply maintain dedicated links to other large pools - to withhold transactions from the rest of the network.

Absolutely, which is why jdillon suggests merchants as for a risk deposit if they are in a situation where such assholes are a problem, such as highly liquid items.
In reality there are few items where this is true; the resale value of a candy bar or cup of coffee is pretty much zero, and the marginal cost to the merchant is a lot less than what it's sold for. Digital goods like MP3s are the same story. Businesses always treat fraud as a matter of losses, and the losses from the occasional asshole essentially committing vandalism just aren't a big deal.

FWIW This general idea is known as a fidelity bond; the wiki has more detail on how exactly you implement it [here]( In particular the mechanics of the "proving you paid a transaction fee" thing is quite a bit more subtle than in the article; as described anyone with hashing power and/or patience can create fake sacrifices that cost about 1% of their "face value" by mining the transactions themselves, so you need an announce/commit protocol which proves that everyone had an equal opportunity to mine the transaction by first publishing it in the blockchain itself for everyone to see, but with nLockTime set so only some time after publication could it be actually mined.

People regularly pay fees hundreds or even thousands of times higher than current transaction fees to send money around the world.
What's going to be really interesting is that there is a *huge* variation in value per transaction to Bitcoin's users, everything from people to whom even a $100 transaction fee is worth it, to people for whom the current minimum fees are too expensive. Tthe latter group are already making a lot of use of off-chain transaction services (e.g. faucets and content micropayments using inputs.io and similar) or have shifted their transactions to be internal to the application. (e.g. just-dice vs. satoshidice)
Furthermore there are those using the blockchain for stuff like timestamping and data storage/messaging, and those uses are also competing with everyone else for blockchain space. We also don't have any way of stopping those uses other than making transactions expensive.

I had the opportunity to interview at Google a few years back. FWIW it wasn't for a job that fit my career goals, but at the time I was at a startup with financial problems, so I took the opportunity seriously. Part of my research included tracking down a former co-worker who now worked at Google's Mountain View location and he said pretty similar things about 20% that jdillonbtc is saying, including the need for management approval. Although to be clear, the management approval my co-worker mentioned wasn't to *start* a project, it was to *continue* a project that management didn't think had any hope of befitting google.

So how exactly are you going to hold a network consensus vote? You've got exactly two methods: vote based on mining power, and vote based on some sort of proof of stake. The former has precedent, the P2SH vote was done by putting a string in the coinbase, and [BIP34]( by putting the block height. (the feature BIP34 is supposed to introduce) Proof of stake probably can't be done without mining support, so it's really a mining vote.
But since it's a mining vote, every time the block size increases as I explained above the more centralized, more well-connected, miners get to push the more decentralized miners out. It's also not just about miners, everyone who wants to verify the blockchain and ensure that the rules are being followed, particularly the anti-inflation rules, needs a copy of the whole block chain.
You know to say "marginal players" with "pathetic internet connections" is really saying Bitcoin will be a currency for the mainstream with access to fancy network hardware. If you're in some shitty regiem with censorship and low-bandwidth internet access, you just won't be able to use Bitcoin without trusting someone else. This is centralization and it's not what I want to see Bitcoin become; Bitcoin is special because it is decentralized. Bitcoin can't be both a high-volume micropayment system and fully decentralized, and I'd much rather pick the latter at the cost of the former. You can always build micropayment systems on top of Bitcoin, and payment systems built on top of Bitcoin are more trustworthy when can easily run a full node that audits their on-chain activities. Large blocks don't let you do that.
Finally you have a lot of "perhaps" and "maybes" about future tech, but who's to say any of that is going to happen? You're hoping for some non-existent wideband radio thing to get deployed all over the place, by robots no less, when leaving the block limit as it is means we know radio distribution with technology available right now will work. You assume somehow tor is going to get faster and more reliable, when you have no idea what the government and others will think of tor in the future. Quite possibly tor will be marginalized and get slower. Again, keeping the 1MiB limit as it is means Bitcoin is far more likely to work in the future.
Raising the block limit is horribly shortsighted, and risks the future of Bitcoin for mere convenience.

Proving fraud is enough, because with that proof you can take actions that punish those who committed it. If those actions cost them more than the fraud gained in the first place, you have an economic incentive to be honest, just like miners have an economic incentive to mine honestly.
The easiest form of punishment is just to destroy their reputation and future business. (remember that we can have computer programs evaluate these proofs so this happens automatically) But in addition to that, we can do things like have the Bitcoin network itself evaluate proofs of fraud, and based on those proofs destroy Bitcoin-denominated bonds and/or return funds to their rightful owners. The latter needs a more sophisticated scripting language - the one Satoshi implemented is frustratingly limited - but that change can be done in a "soft-fork" that just needs miner support, much like how P2SH support (multisignature addresses) was implemented.
@_date: 2013-10-08 08:34:26
There needs to be some impedance to this madness.
@_date: 2013-02-11 18:45:42
The exactly number isn't really the issue. Satoshi could have picked 0.5MiB, 10MiB, whatever. The problem is that changing the maximum block size is a hard fork change: *every* single node on the network, *including* every client, must agree to the new change or the network will split with disastrous consequences. This is a very difficult change to implement and will take a lot of work and few years to phase in, so there will be a strong push to make the block size "adaptive" in some fashion so it doesn't have to be changed again.
The only proposals I've seen that do this work by essentially voting, and the problem there is that by increasing the blocksize nodes that have marginal network connections are forced out of the network, leaving the nodes with less marginal network connections. This is even worse because big miners, who have spent a lot of money on fast network connections and fast computers, can bully miners who haven't spent that money off of the network by continually voting to increase block sizes. It'd be like repeatedly holding votes on how rich you need to be to be allowed to vote - the threshhold might start off small and seemingly reasonable, but every time some of the people at the bottom get forced out, and can't vote anymore, power is concentrated at the top.
You also have to remember that a core principle of why Bitcoin is secure is the idea that information is easy to spread and hard to stifle. Spreading 1MiB every 10 minutes is really easy even in the face of pretty harsh censorship. We could even do things like broadcast the Bitcoin blockchain feed over amateur radio, home-made satellite downlinks, steganographically hidden in video streams, etc. This makes Bitcoin extremely hard to censor right now, and thus very difficult for governments to block.
However, if blocks are bigger, many of these options just aren't feasible anymore. For instance I can't transmit 1GiB/10minutes over a low-power ham radio and never will be able to - the laws of physics don't allow it because low-power, far-reaching, radio has very little bandwidth. Bitcoin nodes will become much easier to detect, and thus much easier to censor. I think it is much more important to keep Bitcoin robust and censorship resistant than it is to allow unlimited-sized blocks just because we're too lazy to use alternatives for low-value transactions. I don't care if buying a chocolate bar has to use some trusted semi-centralized off-chain Bitcoin transfer service, it's just 0.1BTC so it's acceptable if occasionally it gets stolen due to a fraudulent bank. I do care that my life savings are secure, and I'm willing to pay a dollar or two in transaction fees for the rare times I need to touch my cold-storage wallet.
tl;dr - Bitcoin can be the ultra-secure gold standard of digital money, but only if we keep the block size limited so everyone can afford the hardware to verify the blockchain themselves.

What's ironic is it's myself and Gregory Maxwell, both supposed leaders of the "keep it small camp", who are doing the most work trying to figure out how to create truly scalable crypto-coin systems, including how those systems could be retrofitted onto Bitcoin in a backwards compatible way. Unlike the "just raise it" camp we're also thinking hard about how you can make the economic incentives also work, and keep it possible to validate the chain and prevent miner fraud.
One example: my MMR TXO commitments scheme, explained here by gmaxwell:  Roughly speaking you can say it promises to solve about half the scalability problem, storage, and we're working on the other half, bandwidth.

A larger blocksize will at some point kill off P2Pool, and an unlimited blocksize definitely will. Remember that P2Pool miners all have to process all blocks in full to keep up and contribute.
@_date: 2013-11-17 21:44:59
The reason why wallets and the Bitcoin-QT reference implementation have default fee settings is because you need some way to protect the P2P network from flooding it with transactions that will never be mined, and thus don't cost the attacker anything to broadcast.
What's more interesting is that including a transaction in a block has a cost, because a larger block has a higher chance of being orphaned when another miner finds a block at the same time. This cost depends on the bandwidth and latency between miners, as well as the size of the miner. Unfortunately [myself]( and [Michael Gronager]( have been doing some analysis of that cost lately, and it appears that the default 0.1mBTC/KB fee is too low with current network conditions. That can be changed, but in the long run as the inflation subsidy lowers the dependence of fees on hashing power means that larger miners have much lower costs to include a transaction in a block, which creates an incentive towards centralization. I don't think anyone has a good idea of how to fix that.

Huh? Jeff Garzik is the only developer who has written libraries.
Bitcoin should have been a core protocol engine, and a separate wallet program communicating over the RPC interface from the start.


You're missing my point. The scripting system *could* have been what future-proofed Bitcoin, but Satoshi didn't think it through enough and left out the features, like separating OP_CHECKSIG into separate hashing and signature signing steps, that would have made those advanced uses possible.


Implementing Bitcoin and getting all the details right is so hard that it's probably beyond our understanding of computer science and software engineering right now. It's a testing challenge similar to developing safety critical avionics software. That's why most of the core developers are strongly opposed to using re-implementations for mining.

People need to understand that blacklists fundementally damage privacy, and decentralization. The only way to achieve even moderate financial privacy in Bitcoin is to mix and swap your coins with others with protocols like CoinJoin and CoinSwap. Those protocols can't work if blacklists are common and people can't risk accidentally mixing their coins with tainted and blacklisted coins; remember that a coin can and will be blacklisted *after the fact* and *you* may be the one left holding the bag.
Blacklists and whitelists are inherently sources of centralization: some of them *will* get the official approval of regulators in your jurisdiction, and the way laws are written guarantees that you will be forced to use those approved lists.
We as a community need to ensure that privacy technologies like CoinJoin are deployed ASAP to ensure that the basic Bitcoin infrastructure and the fundemental way wallets work makes blacklists useless. If we don't do this before people like Yifu Guo and Mike Hearn get their way, we risk losing our chance to deploy this technology, and losing the privacy and fungibility of our Bitcoins.

Exactly. Among other things I got interested in the Freenet project and taught myself about what properties the cryptographic primitives had. I certainely didn't, and still don't, have a deep mathematical understanding but having a solid understanding of what the black boxes do rather than the details of *how* they do it is good enough for most purposes.
FWIW, I was also homeschooled for a few years so the idea of learning something on my own was rather natural. If you want to do the same I'd suggest reading the book Cryptography Engineering to get started; Bruce Schneier's one of the authors and the book is as readable and clear.
Anyway, learning about cryptography isn't as hard to make it out to be; I think it's like learning how to do the ropework associated with rockclimbing: it's actually all relatively simple stuff, it's just that if you screw up even a small detail when you're doing it for real the consequences are horrendous.

He probably wasn't that either; he made many design decisions that suggest he wasn't a "professional" cryptographer.
When I first read about hashcash back in highschool I remember spending a bunch of time trying to figure out how to turn it into a currency; I came up with a few designs that were close to Bitcoin, but always missing the mark in some way or another. But how close I personally came really suggests to me that the final "leap of intuition" that lead Satoshi to Bitcoin's design was achievable by so-called mere mortals. In addition remember that for a cryptographer the fact that the defender in the Bitcoin system only has a linear advantage over the attacker, rather than an exponential one, really runs contrary to how cryptographic systems are designed, yet in the case of Bitcoin social and economic factors make such a system work anyway; that's the kind of idea that often takes an outsider with a fresh perspective to come up with, and such outsiders don't have to be world-class geniuses with years of experience in the field.

It's just a way of outsourcing the management to someone else.
For companies and funds especially it's complex and difficult to come up with your management plan for how you'll hold actual Bitcoins. On the other hand traditional funds are well understood, in particular the legal implications of them, so by creating a trust to hold the Bitcoins on your behalf you let them go to all that effort, and you get to get the exposure to Bitcoins that you want without the overhead.
It's basically the same reason why there exist gold funds who's value is derived from gold in some third-party-managed vault: if you're company isn't a specialist in the business of gold storage why not outsource that task to someone else?

Nope. bitcoind and bitcoin-qt are the same program; bitcoind leaves out the GUI stuff. That's the problem really, both include wallet code and blockchain code, and it's all intermingled.


That's what Satoshi *should* have done. OP_CHECKSIG includes hashing the transaction and checking the signature in one opcode.


Sure, but had Bitcoin been designed better actually performing that testing would be a lot easier than it is now.
For instance did you know that Bitcoin's behavior depends on OpenSSL's non-standard implementation of ECC signatures? Bitcoin just passes signatures directly to OpenSSL without checking them in any way what-so-ever.

No, you're very, very mistaken there.
Namecoin is just like Mastercoin: validation is done by clients, AKA full nodes.(1) But validation only checks that a chain is logically consistant - you still need to come to consensus on what has happened. Namecoin needs consensus to solve the double-spend problem, and so does Mastercoin.

Normally in a cryptographic protocol if the defender does *n* units of work, the attacker will have to do something like *2^n* units of work to carry out an attack. Of course, this means it's very easy to get security so good as to be literally unbreakable - as Bruce Schneier famously said:


The universe isn't big enough to get enough energy to create a computer that even just counts from 1 to 2^256
However in Bitcoin, if the defenders do *n* units of work, the attackers only have to do just over *n* units of work to compromise the whole system - compared to any other cryptography protocol that's awful security. On the other hand, in practice that security still seems to be good enough due to the economic and social incentives built into Bitcoin.

SatoshiDice isn't actually affected by this patch at all. They simply need to deduct enough from the initial bet to pay for the 54uBTC required for the "you lost" transaction output. What is affected is sites like BitHits and CoinAds that make lots of small payments to many different customers, and they were already having some problems with transaction fees eating up most of their payments.
FWIW I proposed an adaptive version of this patch awhile back that would automatically pick the limit based on transaction fees; Gavin decided to go with a fixed limit to keep things as simple as possible.

Very roughly speaking there's two approaches for doing decentralized currency systems:
1) Full consensus: everyone knows the state of every coin, so there's no question as to whether or not a transaction is valid once confirmed in the blockchain.
2) Fraud detection and punishment: a variety of semi-trusted third parties maintain ledgers, but in such a way that proving fraud is easy, and fraud proven results in them being punished in some way and/or coins being returned to their rightful owners.
Now, for the most part proposed systems based on principle  depend on  existing, so they aren't independent ideas. Real world example: with appropriate cryptography inputs.io fucking up wouldn't have resulting in people losing their coins, it would have resulted in customers of inputs.io being able to prove that they fucked up, and recovery the majority of their funds automatically, as well as taking away a fidelity bond of Bitcoins held in trust to make sure that in the event of a screw up, the operators were guaranteed to lose out financially.
Unfortunately Satoshi permanently disabled most of the Bitcoin scripting language years ago after a few security holes in it were found, so right now it's impossible to implement the special scripts required to return customer funds given proof of fraud.

It's easy for a merchant to verify that only one person was paid in a given transaction by making sure they were the only people paid.

As I said, figuring out who owns what XRP tokens.
Basically Ripple just automates the process of you asking your friends if they have any friends who in turn have friends who might owe a debt to you. That process requires only loose, local, consensus on who owes what, not global consensus. You can't double-spend anything other than the XRP tokens in Ripple because all of the transfers are unique to each pair of Ripple users that trust each other.

You are welcome to look for hints in the blockchain - we'll even help you out and answer your questions about how Bitcoin works and where the weaknesses are. But don't coerce everyone else to reduce their privacy to make your job easier.
This is very much like the NSA and FBI with regard to privacy and security: The NSA and FBI *should* be conducting surveillance of our domestic criminals and foreign state-level enemies. They *should* be finding ways to break the security of those enemies. And all those actions *should* be conducted under an effective oversight regime.
Instead that oversight regime has failed us, and we see the NSA deliberately subverting technology standards to weaken and remove the security and privacy protections built into those standards. Protections that should be protecting us from those same criminals and foreign enemies.
Blacklists and whitelists are fundamentally incompatible with decentralization and privacy in Bitcoin because the only way to make them effective is if tracking the flow of money through the system is possible. If it isn't possible, then blacklists and whitelists threaten the fungibility of your coins until it is made possible.
Sacrificing everyone's privacy and the value of your coins for the sake of catching a few criminals just isn't worth it.
