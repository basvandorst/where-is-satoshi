Isn't that partially due to the inability to split the dollar beyond 100 of a fraction?

I think and this is just a guess there's something going on beneath the surface here. I would imagine that there are tons of people who paid steam in Bitcoin back when it was 800 or less per coin. I would bet now there's tons of people seeking refunds and trying to get their Bitcoin back now that the price has spiked...
Could be a complete guess

I asked / partially argued that perhaps one reason why we have government incentivizing using currency is there an ability because of physical properties to split currencies, more than a penny today.
Electronic currency even the US dollar can we split up as much as we would want. Would just not also be a anti-inflationary tactic?

If paypal integrates with Bitcoin, how will they be able to totally screw over the seller and hold all their funds?
I'm assuming they will require a bank account or holding x amount of funds in reserve?

My current power pricing makes mining unprofitable, but moving the rigs to a cheaper source (Washingon for example) would allow them to at least break even for the moment.

Block chain technology can be agnostic to Bitcoin and there might be other currencies that downstream over take Bitcoin but still use a block chain ledger. 
I fail to see how it's wrong for these 2 things to exist in separate spheres.

I dont see anything wrong with his children involved in the administration.  1st, anyone voting for Trump knows his children have been running his companies for years now and it's not like he's not going to discuss and seek their input.
2nd, if he put his kids in charge of key positions they have no experience in that would be in my mind nepotism, but including them in the administration so they can but contribute and learn is a pretty smart move assuming they are teachable and also solid contributors.
