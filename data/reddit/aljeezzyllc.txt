I ported my original Ting number to google voice and have a data plan with Unreal that includes its own separate number which worked fine with signup. So maybe it just doesnt like GV? I recommend the S2 plan also because its much faster to sync.

Shopify has a header portion that is always visible while browsing a storefront. So far I have only planted a header link "Buy it now with Bitcoin" that sends the patron directly to my btcpay server app page. The app page has the 12 or so purchase options for different amounts of my single product. It only collects the patron's email. I guess the patrons can email me their shipping address; which is fine with me. Keep in mind that I tried to deactivte my shopify store weeks ago but i signed up with google domains and they sign in to shopify for me which creates a situation that disables the 'quit shopify' button. I have to call a # to deactivate. This is perfect for testing to see if shopify shuts me down because i violated their terms of service by utilizing btcpayservers. Thank you BTCPayServer!!

Results will be posted. Also Lunanode doesnt like VOIP phone numbers because it didnt like my googlevoice number which might be a hang up for some. But LN accepts paypal which is good for the masses. Im gonna btcpay my shopify store even if it means getting punted for violating their TOS.

Aphelio your comments are off topic. Could you prune your comments [delete them] so that folks can more efficiently read through these BTCPay comments so we can all learn and improve integration. Your post-whoring is slowing down BTC integration.

Everyone's goal here is to increase their online sales by accepting bitcoin. Please create something better than BTCPay on your preferred platform if it's possible and if you can.

i deleted the shopify page. it wasnt smooth as silk like my newest one. already had my domain paid for so i skip over to SiteGround.com and $47 later i have a year of hosting with an IP to point my domain to. Wordpress is preinstalled and you must upload the woocommerce plugin. This really is the fastest easiest and cheapest method for selling online. paypal checkout included. Best Option For Beginers is This Tutorial  Also dont spend $12 at 1&amp;1.com because you cant point your domain to their IP because 1&amp;1 is sub-par.
