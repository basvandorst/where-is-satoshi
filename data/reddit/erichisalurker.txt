Nah they've had an FAQ out saying they'll begin trading bcash since the fork in august.
Edit: actually just re-read the FAQ and it states they are only planning to open up withdrawals. My b!

THANK YOU. I'm so sick of seeing these posts. You can't have your cake and eat it too. Cryptos themselves are not centrally regulated by any authority and therefore none of this shit is illegal. Does it look bad? Sure, I guess. It's just part of the game though. I didn't see anyone complaining about pro-btc media coverage involving people with huge stakes in BTC, so how is this any different? If BTC wants to compete, it needs to fucking *compete*. This means addressing the criticisms and defining a niche. Currency? Or volatile, expensive, deflationary store of value? Pick one.

Nothing, it's not illegal in crypto. There's really not much that is outside of tax evasion. Otherwise regulatory bodies would have a lot to say about the PnDs of the shitcoin of the day.

Ya I edited my previous comment.
@_date: 2016-06-07 23:28:54
I honestly have no clue. I would probably chalk it up to a typo in the price box.
@_date: 2016-06-23 17:41:13
Is ripple another crypto? I've stuck mostly to btc over the years. I tried to speculate/arb LTC a few years back and promptly lost a bunch of money haha so I haven't messed around too much since.

Idk man a $60 price run up in 30 mins doesn't sound ideal for stable growth even in a bull mkt.
@_date: 2016-06-13 22:31:54
I suppose you could transfer a lump sum at one time and then spend $20/week from there.
@_date: 2016-06-03 11:53:41
Just got done throwing some darts at my calendar while asking the bitcoin gods. Should be at $600 in 3 days
@_date: 2016-06-23 17:33:53
Yea don't get me wrong, I'm certainly not opposed as long as I can sell at the peak, ya know? ;)
@_date: 2016-06-07 16:39:27
From what I gather (I'm not 100% sure), there was a big sell order put in way below market price. This caused a bunch of slippage since it cleared out the order book, but it quickly corrected itself.
@_date: 2016-06-23 18:21:25
Thanks for the heads up I'll do some research! Might throw some money just for shits and gigs.
@_date: 2016-06-23 17:25:42
Haha yea tbh I'm bummed I didn't pull the trigger on a buy this morning at 570 when I had the chance but as they say, hindsight is 20/20. I'm trying to average down the cost of my holdings for a longer run hold and so as long as the price is below my current average I'm not too concerned.
@_date: 2016-06-16 05:13:48
Love that you pointed out the inflation bit. People seem to forget that some inflation is a good thing for growth, and that we're not even reaching our targets for it.

I'm pretty sure it was august 1 2017

There's an FAQ on the coinbase site. It indicates that BCH will roll out on Jan 1, 2018. You will be credited an amount of BCH equal to the amount of BTC you had at the time of the fork.
@_date: 2017-05-02 15:43:37
This doesn't sound like a bad idea to me. Don't just dump it all in at once though, DCA over a period of time. 
Also as a side note why are you contributing so much to your 401k instead of just maxing the match? If you're not funding a Roth already you should reduce the 401k contributions and open one. I don't mean to assume anything about your financial situation, but 12% seems steep at your income level.
@_date: 2017-05-02 16:31:55
Yea definitely worth looking into! Feel free to message me if you have any other questions. 
@_date: 2017-05-01 20:56:19
Do you know how it's calculated? Like is it just the average price from US exchanges?

Paul Krugman is far from a complete and utter moron. He's a world-renowned economist and a professor at very highly-regarded University. Just because his beliefs don't align with many of our does not diminish his accomplishments and knowledge of economic theory. Plus the linked article was written during the late-2013 bubble, and a lot has changed since then.

Was this the show in the bay area? I think one of my friends was out there as well!

A 401k isn't tax free, it's contributed to with pre-tax dollars and tax deferred until distribution, at which point it's taxed as normal income. You contribute to a Roth with after-tax dollars, it grows tax deferred, and is income tax free in retirement. As for the tax bracket, you may not be in a higher income bracket but it's not out of the question for income taxes overall to be higher and having a Roth in addition to your 401k will help to hedge against this risk. 
What is the maximum that your employer will match on your 401k? You have the right idea with trying to save a lot for retirement but exceeding the maximum match is generally only recommended if you're above the income limit for a Roth or if the contributions will reduce your tax bracket.

Haven't there been some security issues with coinbase?
@_date: 2013-04-11 02:11:59
I'm assuming it just creates lag in the system as the MT. Gox servers try to process them all. The lag leads people to panic sell I think. Don't quote me on this, it's just what I think based on what I've read throughout the day today.

I would love to use dwolla, however every time I try to upload a picture of my ID (NC driver's license) it tells me that the upload has failed. Any ideas why?

Try using charlie
It's the CEO. He replied to me within 24hours.

It wasn't a market order though. I.was transferring .32 btc from my SR wallet to my btc-e wallet and the funds have not been confirmed after almost 24 hours.

It's back up now, I just made a payment slip. But do you know how it works?

Oh, I understand now. I had thought you meant that if there was a massive sell off then the dow would somehow magically jump to 21000, haha my bad man.
@_date: 2013-04-08 13:09:13
I was accidentally sent 5btc by someone when they were worth $40, so it's nice to see that accidental fortune worth much more than that now.

What if mtgox is a legitimate business and they didn't do that?

Does this apply to me if I'm under 18? I don't have to pay any taxes on my income from my job (other than Medicaid and social security). So what should I do?

I don't understand, please explain?

Oh I use the "more local options" and go to cvs. But you don't know the rate that bit instant uses?

As a 17 year-old soon-to-be college student, I wish that I had $10,000 that I could afford to part with so I could invest in bitcoins.

Sounds good to me. But do you know if it'll actually be taxed or if I just need to declare it?
@_date: 2013-04-03 14:22:56
Here's the real kicker though: I've been trying to PM support and its telling me that my account has been downs have that privilege. 
I guess I'll just have to check blockchain and wait. This is a bummer though, because I was hoping to speculate on ltc or nmc.
