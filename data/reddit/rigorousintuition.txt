I'll be honest, with the stupid way Roger is carrying on (especially with this 'insider trading is fine' bullshit he is currently spouting) one would think he is pushing for government interference or regulation.
He strikes me as that kind of 'fuck you, i've got mine' sorta guy...

I almost spat out my whiskey as i read this..
I had just came across [this video]( of a whale cashing in his bitcoin and then somehow stumbled across this reddit post.
Whether it is legitimatedly the guy or now - what a god damn coincidence that he would mention Roger Ver and his scumbag tactics...
We are currently going through a power grab it would seem.

Meh, he still 37.5x'ed his initial input, enough to never work again.
That being said, i do agree with you.

Bitcoin is a storage of value like gold.
Buy altcoins with Bitcoin and use altcoins to buy drinks.
Who the fuck owns a business around here?
Man up, show the world how much money you can make accepting crypto and pave the way ;)

The 'average bitcoin price' was read out with the financial stats on my AM news station this morning.
I lol'd.

Mate, are you able to recommend one of the safer local bitcoin wallets? (as in stored on my local machine) or perhaps the safest possible method of storage?
