Its hilarious how all the bitcoiners decry "FUD" when that is exactly what they use to support their reasoning.  That link exists for no reason other than irrational fear.

I agree with everything you just wrote and yet we're in the Bitcoin subreddit where people fucking blow the debt issue out of complete proportion like it's going to be the end of the fucking world and we're going to have run into this point where our entire system collapses and if you believe that you're a fucking moron

Counterfeiting is not the concern. Having to keep large amounts of cash on hand in order to satisfy any possible person leave small businesses at higher risk. Any remotely well operated retail establishment has hard-and-fast rules about how much money can be kept in it till at any point in time and how to properly store excess cash.  Large chains have additional mechanisms in place for maintaining compliance with such rules while also providing cashiers the ability to access additional funds through a secure process such as a time lock safe or managerial override , Etc

I wasn't saying that the information is inaccurate I was saying that pointing at that information does nothing but inspire fear, uncertainty, doubt, within basic non-thinking folks, which you've done a great job of exemplifying.   
Thats FUD dawg
