Assuming you live in the US, you have to pay _some_ capital gains tax.
Hypothetical: You buy 10 BTC for $10,000 at the end of March. You sell 1 BTC for $10,000 at the beginning of December.
From your point of view: You broke even, and have 9 BTC to sell later.
From the IRS's point of view: You paid $1,000 for the 1 BTC you sold for $10,000, so you made $9,000. You owe short term capital gains on that $9,000.

The IRS is actively investigating this sort of thing and has been granted access to identify information and transaction details about [more than 14,000 Coinbase users [that] have either bought, sold, sent or received at least $20,000 worth of bitcoin in a given year](
I don't have a crystal ball, but if they can use that data to demonstrate tax evasion is common, it seems like they would then argue for access to more data.

When you sell a company, you don't get all of the proceeds. A large portion goes to your investors and then some (perhaps much) of whatever you do get is effectively back-pay for the time you spent building the company for little to no pay.

My comment was not about fees, it was about the effective cost of conversion due to the inequality between the BTC-to-USD and USD-to-BTC exchange rates.
It's easiest to see with an exchange like coinbase that offers conversions in both directions. Their current buy price is $638.06 and their sell price is $635.50. At those rates, if I were to buy $100 worth of BTC (.15672507) and immediately convert it back, I'd only have $99.60 -- even if there were no fees involved.
This is a reality for any sort of exchange; there's always going to be at least a small difference between the buy and sell price. The difference with bitcoin is usually small, but it can't be ignored when contrasting payment methods.
@_date: 2014-03-10 13:48:47
You're forgetting to consider the bid-ask spread. It's usually works out to less than .5% on coinbase, but it's certainly something to include in "a thoughtful analysis".

Step 1: Get a whiteboard.
Step 2: Explain public key cryptography.
Step 2b: Take a brief detour to explain how public key cryptography is already used in SSL.
Step 3: Explain the block chain.
Step 4: Guide discussion until someone asks about initial allocation of wealth or how the blockchain can be secure. Use this as a jumping off point to explain mining (and tie in the other concept).
Step 5: Discuss advanced concepts such as contracts (escrow, distributed lottery, or deposits) or offline transactions as time permits.

[He bought 2 pizzas](


At the time, 10,000 bitcoins was worth exactly 2 pizzas; it was one of the first (if not _the first_) instance of someone making a purchase for physical goods with bitcoin, ~~so there was no "market" to establish any other price.~~
Edit: As pointed out, my recollection was wrong. The value at the time was $41, so he overpaid a bit for the pizzas.
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:22:19


The cool thing about the $10,000 mark is that 1 bit is now worth 1 cent.

It happened [on bitcointalk.org]( (Edit: or [maybe IRC](


"Q. What do you primarily use bitcoins for? Do you still control millions of dollars worth?
A. Bitcoin as a currency is meant to be spent. Those 10,000 BTC made it back into the economy fairly quickly, around the time they were worth some $400. A ~10x ROI from simply trading in a different currency is quite good, even if that factor could have been higher had I held on to said currency longer. Naturally there will always be people hoarding coins, trying to get rich, and quite a few people did get quite rich, but they wouldn't have got that way without economic growth allowing it. To that extent my bitcoin holdings do usually measure in hundreds or thousands of USD, simply because I use them much as I would a checking account, to conduct business both online and offline when I have the opportunity. Notably the "humble bundles" and the attached store accepting bitcoins significantly bolstered my video game library."

Alternatively, you can generate a key with a passphrase, use that  key to encrypt the document, and share that key with a set of partially-trusted actors. Any of these actors could attempt to brute force the passphrase, so we must chose one of suitable complexity. Then, use a system like [Shamir's Secret Sharing]( so that a given number, `k`, of the total `N` partially-trusted actors must collaborate to determine the passphrase,
This has the advantage that not all `N` of the partially-trusted actors have to be available to perform decryption.

In doing so, you raise an interesting point: unlike currency (fiat or crypto), some goods transcend cultural boundaries; many places in the world, it'd be completely accepted to buy someone a drink as a demonstration of gratitude, regardless of the currency being used to fund the transaction.
In such a transaction, only the business you are making the purchase from would care and, as a business, they usually indicate (explicitly or implicitly) which forms of payment they're willing to accept.


They are? When explaining emotional reactions, it's often necessary to convey the state of mind a person might be coming from. I find analogies and anecdotes to be convenient for this.

To expand a bit on what others have said (since I just went through the process a couple days ago):
1. Go to 
2. Create an account. Use a strong password that you're not going to forget.
3. Go to 
4. Go through the steps to get to Level 1 (verify your email address, phone, and associate a bank account).
5. Go to 
6. Enable some sort of 2 factor authentication (google authenticator or SMS access)
7. Wait a couple days until the "verification transactions complete." (Ever link a bank account to PayPal? Same idea.) Once they have, you can prove you own the bank account you linked in step 4.
At this point, you're *set up* to sell up to 10 BTC/day. You haven't actually sold anything. Your wallet on your disconnected device is still as safe as it was before following these instructions.
If you want to sell them, I'd send 10 BTC at a time from your current wallet to your coinbase address^*, sell them, wait for things to clear and the money to show up in your account, and repeat. After 30 days, you'll be eligible for Level 2, at which point you can transfer up to 50 BTC/day instead.
\* - I'm not sure what the safest way to perform a transfer from your disconnected wallet would be, so I'll let someone else comment on that.

It's actually a pretty good read (at least until you get to the "detailed description of the invention" section; it gets pretty dense at that point). What's interesting to me is that while much motivation (paragraphs 10-17) could be (and often is) also used as a justification for Bitcoin, the invention seems address the cited shortcomings in a rather different way.
As one would expect in a patent application from a bank, the model is heavily centralized; EFT integration is core to the system. This provides for some advantages, such as being able to process credit card transactions (paragraph 22), but has obvious (to readers of this subreddit) drawbacks.
All-in-all, it seems to be a significant advance over the state of the art for banking. The ability to do direct peer-to-peer transaction processing (paragraph 23), the idea of a "receive only" address (paragraph 24), and the finality of "push" transactions (paragraph 32)  are all big steps forward in my mind.
However, it doesn't have any of the advantages of Bitcoin which stem from its decentralized nature. Whether those advantages alone would be enough to continue to attract mainstream consumers to Bitcoin over such a system (especially if they manage to make such a system *usable*) remains to be seen.

I don't see overlap between the claims made in this patent application and the protocol as described in the "Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System" paper.

Don't feel too bad. It looks like you started watching when it was already at $100. I've been watching since it was mentioned on Slashdot back in, like, 2010. I remember thinking "Huh... should have bought some" back in early 2011 when the price hit 1 USD=1 BTC.

Phrases like "accessing the computer memory using a computer processor" are necessary to ensure that the patent passes the M-O-T test (see In re Bilski); an abstract description of an algorithm is *not* patentable.
In fact, in the Non Final Rejection on October 18, the examiner states that the phrase "accessing the computer memory using a computer processor to retrieve the payer information and instructions and executing the instructions to perform steps including" is insufficiently clear and suggests an alternate wording to make it clear no human is involved:








@_date: 2013-12-11 03:55:49


You're right; they haven't.
In fact, it looks like the last notable event prior to this pre-grant publication was that the examiner issued a Non-Final Rejection (back in mid October) which covered claims 155-175 (all of the uncancelled claims). The examiner appears to be arguing that various claims fail the M-O-T test (because they are directed to an abstract idea) and that various claims fail to particularly point out and distinctly claim the subject matter which the inventors regard as the invention as well as providing specific criticisms of some claims. All of these issues seem correctable. The examiner does seem to be concluding that the claims are otherwise allowable over the prior art record, so the patent won't be rejected on those grounds.

Fortunately, that's not how patents work. While there are similarities, this is not how Bitcoin works. As a result, Bitcoin can not be considered prior art (and if this were patented prior to the invention of Bitcoin, Bitcoin could not be found to infringe on this claim).

^(I realize I'm not getting a tip. I just actually want to make a comment about this.)


I think this succinctly captures why point is silly. However, in a way, the frustration is sort of understandable.
If I was wandering down a street in Europe, saw a street performer, and left a tip in USD, the performer can simultaneously be both grateful for the tip but offended by my use of a non-local currency.
(In this case, it's a bit different; it's like you popped into the nearest cafe, converted your $5 tip into €3.63, and gave that. However, this distinction doesn't really matter; embarassement is an emotional response, not a logical one.)
While we may not agree with the OP, understanding where he's coming from may be valuable; continuing to express values in fiat is going to be uncomfortable for storng advocates of bitcoin and similarly, expressing values in bitcoin is going to be uncomfortable for newcomers, even if the value stabilizes.

I'd buy a brand new computer, disable networking/wireless cards, and install linux from a live dvd. Then, I'd install Armory and generate a new private key. I'd back that private key up on several (new) thumbdrives (and put one of those in a bank safety deposit box). I'd then sweep my 1000 bitcoins (from whatever cold storage wallet I had been using) to the corresponding address.
Each day, I'd perform an Armory offline transaction to send 50 BTC to my coinbase account's wallet and sell those at market value, withdrawing the money to an actual bank account as it cleared. It'd take three weeks to cash out, but spreading the bank deposits out over time minimizes a lot of the risks and buys me some time to get in touch with an accountant of some sort to advise me on the banking side of things.
@_date: 2013-12-05 23:11:39


I'd buy a brand new computer, disable networking, and replace the OS because it gives me a system to use that would be (very) difficult to hack.
By generating a new private key on that system and sweeping my coins to it, I ensure that there's no existing wallet backup or anything that could be compromised (which would defeat the purpose of an offline system).
By making several copies of that private key and putting at least one in a different physical location, I reduce the risk of losing access to my bitcoins due to hardware failure or disaster (e.g. fire).
By using offline transactions, I never have to connect my air-gaped system to the network; I can build the transaction, sign it, put it on a flash drive, copy the signed transaction onto a networked computer, and submit the transaction without ever exposing my private key to a hacker. (For added safety, I could burn CDs instead of using a flash drive to eliminate the chance of transmitting malware.)
By minimizing the amount of time my coins and USD balance are in my coinbase account, I reduce the risk of loss due to a hacker compromising my coinbase account (or a coinbase as a whole). As suggested, bitstamp might actually be a better exchange for this sort of transaction (it's just a bit more work to get everything verified).


To be fair, most of this complexity is necessary only because of the value we're talking about. Managing a million dollars isn't something that's common enough to hit the "popular use" threshold.
I'd imagine that if I had a million dollars in a bank account, I'd treat that account a *bit* differently than the way I treat my current bank account.

Actually, this seems to be a pretty smart move; JP Morgan Chase has found a way to address many of the problems addressed by Bitcoin within their current centralized model. They address current pain-points, which should make their customers happy, and if this is actually implemented, there will be fewer net-advantages to Bitcoin (and therefore less motivation for people to adopt it).
