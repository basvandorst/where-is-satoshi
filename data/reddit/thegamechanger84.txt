Yes but through a PM and when I get out of work. Bitcoin has been amazing and it’s actually better to invest in these coins that the stock market right now lol
@_date: 2019-07-30 17:41:30
Sure. Lol why does everyone want to know this?  I have no problem telling you
@_date: 2019-07-30 16:17:17
Use them with a proxy if you can’t use them in your country. I use Kraken in the USA and I’m coming out of Europe. So many loopholes in this shit
@_date: 2019-07-18 04:44:15
I would wait until the price came down a bit. The price is always fluctuating but now it has been going up like crazy
@_date: 2019-03-31 06:02:42
Lol �� 
@_date: 2019-03-28 23:39:02
Okay. I heard of that one. I will use all my information. Why did you say maybe once with Coinbase and then getting banned? Would they take my funds away?
@_date: 2019-03-30 22:16:27
That’s what he said to me. He claims he has a 70% accuracy. I googled this and many people were scammed. There are a bunch of scammers. I just started using bitcoin the other day to pay for my IPTV service on my fire tv. I’m new to all this. I work in finance but with the stock market, not this market. I’m still learning 
@_date: 2019-03-31 01:41:30
Oh because that’s the field I work in. Airbnb is not even public yet. I just said when it does go public it should do well. I just randomly brought it up. 
@_date: 2019-03-30 23:09:42
Oh wow. I didn’t know that. That’s crazy. Do you think that was his website though? Like he owned that platform lol 
@_date: 2019-03-28 23:35:16
Am I able to use my fathers debit bank card on my account on Coinbase?  Would you happen to know this info. Lol sorry for being a pest lol 
@_date: 2019-03-29 00:46:11
Okay and no I wouldn’t steal my fathers card. I would of gave him the money to use it. I never would steal or use anyone’s card with asking. lol not my style. Wouldn’t be fraud if he authorized it. I’m not going to use Coinbase though and I’m going to go with Gemini 
@_date: 2019-03-30 22:48:13
Thank you. I’m starting to realize that. I work for the NYSE in Manhattan on the floor of the stock exchange. I thought this may be similar but I have slot of learning to do lol 
@_date: 2019-03-31 00:19:51
The guy said that his system guarantees that. That’s bullshit and if it were true we’d all be rich. There are tons of people on google saying how they were scammed by people like that. 
SO WHAT SOUNDS LIKE AN AD? You sound like a jerkoff for even saying that to me. No go play in your corner 
@_date: 2019-03-31 00:02:36
Yeah it does I see. I never needed to use the dark web for drugs. I had an alcohol addiction that I’m sober from now and going to the gym and meetings. I don’t support drugs or terrorism 
@_date: 2019-03-28 23:36:56
Oh wow really? That’s crazy. Even if my account is verified? What’s a good one to use? Also, thank you. I really try to help anyone when I could 
@_date: 2019-03-31 02:54:14
I will edit it now. Thanks for understand and being an adult about it. As a matter of fact, I just took the link off. I appreciate your response 
@_date: 2019-03-30 23:37:53
Lol that is for sure. No doubt! No one should be using it. lol I wish I can trade stocks at that win percentage. I’m waiting for Airbnb to hit. Btw, Airbnb will be a good buy when the iPod comes out 
@_date: 2019-03-28 23:24:32
I just subscribed to this sub today and I never had any experience with bitcoin in the past. I just need it to extend my IPTV service for my TVs in the house. I installed Coinbase and verified my account and researched some stuff but I know redditors have a lot a lot of knowledge 
@_date: 2019-03-28 22:34:24
Cash app?
Edit: I just downloaded and set the app up. Thank you. 
@_date: 2019-03-29 01:30:53
That’s awesome. I just started using bitcoin today. I was tipped in my inbox and was super excited. I’m very happy �� for you 
@_date: 2019-03-29 01:31:37
Wow, I was tipped already. This community is very nice ���� 
@_date: 2019-03-30 22:12:43
No he wrote me this in DM.  He gave me the platform name and the site he trades on. Then I went on google and found a bunch of people being scammed. Where do you see an advertisement? That’s the money he wanted me to send him. The guy has -2 karma. What kind of advertising would I be doing here. Reverse advertisement lol
@_date: 2019-03-28 23:10:24
I’m new to bitcoin and just wanted a little help. You don’t have to be a dick 
@_date: 2019-08-11 05:48:37
Alright there Shakespeare
@_date: 2019-08-15 01:49:54
I wish New York got some of these bad boys
@_date: 2019-08-15 01:50:27
That is very ugly
@_date: 2019-04-18 19:17:50
When I was younger I use to buy tons of stuff on the dark web. It’s so encrypted and I have cold storage and other storage that’s more encrypted than the pentagon
@_date: 2019-04-18 19:13:53
It’s all done through bitcoin and encrypted multi layer platforms.
@_date: 2019-04-18 17:04:18
This has already been known. Bitcoin is used for hacking and espionage. There’s a site on the dark web where you pay bitcoins to see whoever you want tortured and beat to a pulp. For like 10 bitcoins you tell them who you want taken care of ��
@_date: 2019-04-18 19:12:14
Lol nice. The FBI is retarded
@_date: 2019-04-28 00:18:19
It’s very easy. Even without watching this video. You can buy groceries probably with bitcoin lol
@_date: 2019-04-18 19:13:33
These sites have been used by many people
@_date: 2019-04-10 23:53:29
That looks like a nice heated up Vagina, or asshole right before after I piledrive my bitch
@_date: 2019-04-18 17:01:29
You need to ask them
@_date: 2019-04-18 20:41:09
Easily but more traceable. You can track the serial numbers especially if you take out lump sums
@_date: 2019-05-13 21:09:14
They can ban it all they want. Lol there are tons of ways to get around that shit
@_date: 2019-05-02 20:15:10
Gold is just as good if not better. I’m old school and rather buy gold. I like looking at it too. I buy the gold bullions
