...or we could devise some new name for fractional bitcoins that would help everyone refer to smaller amounts with more ease.  I know this is a genius idea, but lets call them something like microbits, or millibits, and then we can think up nicer names for those too.  We could rename microbits to Elons, for example.

Has to be religion or politics. Its always religion or politics. ...or cats vs dogs. One of those.

Damn. That's just $881. :\  If someone was going to kill me for $881, I'd gladly give them more to just... not.

tl;dr True, except both often change during lifetime. 
diatribe: At least with recent past generations, people tend to become more conservative (/Republican) as they age - greater earnings, more taxation, heard more stories of abuse of social programs, jealousy, fear of not being able to afford retirement, seen government after government be useless and wasteful etc.  Not sure if that will happen with my generation and those that follow. I hope not. But that may be more of a reflection of current politics.
Likewise people find and lose religion often during lifetime, and often post-marriage.  My brother rarely saw the inside of church,  but not he is married, and raising a child, he regularly attends church.  Some have near-death experiences and after praying and surviving, now they've found God.  I know if my wife became heavily religious, it would put a severe strain on our marriage.

:) No need to wait 7 days.  21 hours ago I wrote in response to this statement:

21 hours later and Bitcoin is sitting at:  $16,916.20
I expect it'll continue upward at least for a while, maybe for some time.  So as predicted, just a bump on the road.
EDIT: Yep, here we are, almost at the one week reminder, and Bitcoin is sitting at $19,497.40.  How thoroughly unpredictable! :D

More likely, and realistically, they got a setback of somewhere between 30 hours and 1 week.  The price dropping like it just did is going to cause tens of thousands of people to buy who thought they missed an opportunity.  Its much easier to see that when you aren't holding any coin.

You are absolutely right, I know nothing about trading, or parabolical moves.  What I DO know though, is that I made no such claim, you've strawmanned my statements to consider an assumption I didn't make to be stupid, and that my limited statements have a strong chance of being correct.  
So by all means check back in with me in a week's time to either say "told you so", or, "Sorry I'm a douche, I was having a bad day".  Whichever you prefer. 
...and on Monday, tens of thousands of people are going to buy their first btc.
Good luck!

I will help clarify.  You used the word "Every".  Every does't just refer to one, or even to many, but to ALL.  Every. This is its standard usage.  I referred to a single instance. I have no doubt Bitcoin's price will correct far lower than its all-time high.  I don't think we've reached it yet.  So I am not saying that "every dip will continue moving up", I am simply stating, which is obvious on its face, that there is a strong chance, given recent history and current climate, that THIS dip will continue moving up. 
I'm not endorsing the coin, its future, or its ability to take over the world, or giving recent investors a guarantee of success.  I'm saying I feel its likely they'll be happy in a week's time, and their paper losses will be either negligible, or turned into gains, in a week.
I don't deal in absolutes, because so few can be known. I just dial it back 7.  No need for 11. :)
