zanetackett, If coins were stored on the exchange/margin as opposed to the deposit address can they still have been taken? Do they need to be in deposit to be removed from the site? I have never moved btc out of finex before.

Well This sucks. I can't tell if I've been robbed because I cannot see what my btc address is without logging in. Would it matter if they were held on the exchange or margin wallet?
No doubt an inside job and we can forget about getting our money back. All this, site down, site down for months likely a roose.

Lets just wait until the suggested "within 48hours" is up. Then we can start worrying.

O.K so I had 1.54btc and 100ETC. Not near some people but am I right in assuming I'm I will return to 0.98btc and 64ETC?

Loved the message from Bitfinex about the phishing. It's not us guys we're the good guys lol. Looks almost legit.

Indeed. And the sooner Bitfinex starts to accumulate trading fees the better.
