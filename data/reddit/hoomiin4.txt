I'm comparing on-chain scaling (blocks to infinity) vs layered scaling. The former isn't viable to reach global adoption, but it is more elegant/secure.
On-chain scaling lets you cheaply/simply move between cold/hot wallets (Exchanges keep \~2% of total funds hot)
Lightning funds are currently orders of magnitude more complex to keep safe/manage. 
* Can't cheaply/easily move funds to/from savings.
* A malicious channel partner could steal funds. We need automatic/affordable Watch Towers for all LN users
* If LN becomes as secure as L1, the Receiving Capacity limit means you can't just 'add' to your LN savings wallet, you have to keep opening more and more channels.
* Backups are harder on LN than on-chain, though Eltoo makes it better
You **could** regularly Splice/Loop-Out funds to on-chain cold storage, but who knows how costly that'll be when we see real adoption.


AMP fragments transactions so they're more easily routed.
This helps if a merchant wants to accept $100, yet only had $25 each receivable across 4 channels, but they're still forced to find that $100+ somewhere to be able to receive it.
Once they're at \~98% capacity, they must Splice/Loop-Out to receive again, incurring a fee for touching L1
Even a modest on-chain fee ($1?) with high adoption, negates the savings LN was meant to have vs Visa, Paypal, etc

Thank you for all of your contributions to Bitcoin and Lightning René!
I'll try my best to wololo a few BCashers back to our side

Don't Channel Factories just make channel-creation cheaper?
This is still a fantastic development, especially for preventing the Hub-and-Spoke model the BCH side always predicted
but your Receiving Capacity is still limited by the amount of money you put into Lightning, or received from some Liquidity Provider

To clarify, I also meant vs altcoins. These points aren't BTC/LN specific, they apply to most of crypto.






Not if it costs dollars to open/close/refill channels, I expect most of these kinds of transactions will be aggregated, but that still seems a **long** way away.

I meant as a merchant mostly selling low-mid range goods. ($1 - $100) The $1000 would come from tens of customers, none of whom will want to pay $1 - $10 fees.
Merchants will need to **commit money to receive money**, which will be weird to a lot of them.
Hopefully we get trustless Liquidity Providers soon, so merchants can just punch in their expected revenue and have large enough channels created automatically.
Thanks for the detailed list, I've been overwhelmed trying to keep up with all the developments on LN lately.

Would love to get cheap BTC, but didn't that Bart movement already close? (The 9k-8k dump)
@_date: 2019-04-21 01:09:59


Yes it does. Supply is controlled by consensus. 
If everyone agreed tomorrow to decrease block size to 300kb, that would certainly change the supply/demand of Bitcoin, which dictates pricing.

I'm not suggesting we balloon the block cap like 'others' are, but conservatively scaling it with global storage/bandwidth would **increase** BTC's security. (If you assume adoption will increase)
All you need to do is increase capacity at a lower rate than new people are entering.
Eg: If we expected to see at least 10x adoption over the next few years, increasing capacity by 2x would increase its security.
Right now:
 $1 Fees x 2k tx/block = $2k fees
$0.70 Fees x 5k tx/block = $3.5k fees
Security would only **decrease** if you raised capacity faster than new people are entering, which I am **not** suggesting.


I agree that running a full node is extremely important for keeping the network transparent, but we **can** scale somewhat on-chain without sacrificing that.

Some people were suggesting that with new signature schemes, entire blocks could be aggregated.

of course, but I think it'll be at least another year -  possibly with lower lows - before that happens.

That's why you keep crypto in your brain wallet. *taps head*

Yeah, people are getting excited about $20-100k BTC being just around the corner, but I dont see how it's possible this soon.
@_date: 2019-05-19 17:24:37


Yeah, I think it **will** be.


Not many... the best selling phones are in the $800-$1000 range.


Where did you get those numbers? 
Looking at their sites, both cost upwards of $70.
Even $40 would be too high for many non-enthusiasts/the poorest people who need financial sovereignty.




What? I'm not saying **bankers** could inflate Bitcoin, it's by design that Bitcoin is currently inflationary. (Specifically, inflation of the supply)
The next halvening is 369 days away. (5/23/20)
Every 10 minutes, 12.5 BTC is created.
$8000 x 12.5 = $100,000 created every 10mins.
144 blocks in a day, x $100,000 = $14.4million.
365 days in a year x $14.4million = $5.25billion. That's ~3.5% inflation.
After a couple more halvenings, yes, Bitcoin is a great thing to hold VS traditional fiat.

You have to admit, not a whole lot actually happened with Bitcoin to push it to $20k. 
Likely a mix of Tether manipulation, and people cashing out their huge altcoin profits into BTC.

If cars were many years away from being ready, "someone like me" would be correct in saying it's too early to expect your Ford stock to 100x
I'm confident all the issues I raised will be solved, but people seem far too overhyped relative to where we actually are with the tech.
@_date: 2019-05-19 17:00:39


Not just that, it needs to be faster/cheaper than VISA/Paypal, or else merchants won't accept it.
BTC/LN need to be so efficient together that rebalancing/moving funds on/off-chain doesnt constantly burden the merchants with long confirmation times and high fees. 
I'm confident we'll reach that point eventually, but maybe not this year or the next.
