I interpret "talking out your ass" as if you think I'm just making it up. I'm not and was just relaying the basics. If you want more qualified info I'd suggest you go on the IRC.

No that's not what the 37% means. The network fee for transactions iirc will be slightly bigger, but still magnitudes smaller than CC fees.

I think you're confused. There are thousands of bitcoin transactions every day and each transaction is charged a "fee". IIRC when a miner successfully mines a block, they are(will be once we stop generating new coins) awarded the fees collected in that block, and the fees change depending on the current block reward and block difficulty and a bunch of other stuff. The 37% is the percentage of a miner's income that they have to sell to pay for their electrical bills from their electric company.

There will/is be a network fee, the miners will collect those instead of new coins.

I can't show you the math, as I only understand a little bit more than the basics about how it works. If you want accurate numbers then I suggest you go ask on the IRC channel.
