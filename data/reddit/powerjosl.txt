Most banks use less than the bitcoin network and can handle millions more transactions. Also most banks are carbon neutral. 
If mass adoption of bitcoin would ever happen trying to replace our current fiat system the energy consumption would be astronomical.
This is not sustainable in its current form. Something needs to change.

Are you fucking retarded??? This here is clear evidence that they have been mining on peoples hardware for months that should have been shipped out right away. 
Basically they stole money from their customers and you try to justify that? Unbelievable....

I call bullshit on the part of them buying designer crap in malls. that stuff is dirt cheap in china. also electronics are much cheaper than in europe or usa.

actually, I just heard about the blades from you. surprised how I missed them. what's a good resource to buy them? might be a better idea instead of getting 30 usb versions.

With all these new miners popping up and the difficulty increasing even more, what is going to happen to all the old mining hardware that is running now and is no longer profitable in a couple of months? People are going to turn them off and then they'll just be pretty paper weights?
I can't stop to think that it's a huge waste of resources on so many levels. Someone should come up with bitcoin 2.0 that doesn't rely on people spending shit loads of money on equipment that only has a purpose for a couple of months.
And please don't bring up the argument again that they are not mining for money but for the network. No one is going to keep their miners running just for the network if the costs of running are not even covering the electricity bill.

right now, bitcoin is NOT an alternative to western union. if you need to wire money to someone that needs it RIGHT AWAY, bitcoin is not an option. he might get the bitcoins right away, but the exchange to real world money still takes too long. and unfortunately, paying everything with bitcoin is not an option yet.
so as of right now, western union still has it's place.

19 BTC each? What? I'm talking about the USB version that is 0.6 BTC each.
