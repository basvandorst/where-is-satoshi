Very true

Yeah, I just hope the infrastructure continues rapidly. The more to adopt it the better of a chance the bitcoin has in the long run

Where else would be a good place to ask this question? But yeah I figured as much, but then again I haven't seen any expected value charts yet either, so I didn't know if it was going to flatline or not. Thanks for the advice!

700$ a BTC would be awesome! The only problem with this is figuring what market to calculate, the percentage of that market, and the timeframe. But as this is the best we can do right now thanks very much!

I know individual transfers are impossible to tax. I am thinking that if they want to make money on it at all, then at banks you would have the opportunity to withdrawn to USD or any national currency, and they would tax there. I am not a complete socialist, but I agree with a lot of it, if we would stop having fucking wars all the time I would be more for it. And socialism isn't complete control of the economy, that is communism there is actually a big difference between the two. Thanks your reply.

I figured as much. I'm still new to this community so I didn't know if bitcoin was in the works of being incorporated into a major site that would spike the value. Yes basicly I'm asking for insider trading via bitcoin. Thanks for your reply
