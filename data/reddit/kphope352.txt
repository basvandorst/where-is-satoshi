No, they closed my account for some reason. I did as you said and was able to transfer btc and ltc, but now I have 2 separate wallet apps instead of just coinbase..annoying.
Can you recommend any other wallets besides bread wallet and loaf wallet? Neither allow you to sell. Don't have a computer at the moment and will have to work off my iPhone

There email is not enabled. They only take requests. I've sent the request, but I was just reading about coinbase's lack of getting back to people about there money. Stupidly, thought nothing of it. 
Is there anyway to transfer my money to another wallet that isn't trying to ram it in your ass?

I'm sorry, I freaking out. 
I was checking prices a few hours ago, everything was good. When I last went to check, it kind of glitches out (iOS app). Closed app, loaded again and it's asking for my password, which I got wrong the first time, I reentered and it sent me a text, I'm doing it all off my phone, with a verification code. Two, actually for some reason. I entered the first, wrong code. I reentered the second, wrong code. 
Said ok, I'm just doing it wrong. Re-went through all of that. Still, nothing.
Like I said, I emailed (through the submit request for, but I was just reading that that's useless). I just want to get a jump on it before I am out of my money

When I transferred from coin base to bread wallet it took over an hour. It'll get there

Nope. Took coinbase sent me an email saying it was sent and bread wallet laid blank for quite some time. Might of been closer to 2-3 hours
