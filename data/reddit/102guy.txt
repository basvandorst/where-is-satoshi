it doesnt mean you should either...
@_date: 2015-06-16 19:58:29
True, but it still does not make it right.
@_date: 2015-06-12 22:05:46


man, this is really gonna shake up the world of hair extension wholesaling

Well done getting your money back.
What's the story with Bitcoin ATMs always crashing?
Normal ATM's generally work fine.


I would recommend taking cash, what if Chris is not available for whatever reason, maybe call him in advance to let him know your going and make sure he is on standby just incase..
@_date: 2015-06-12 13:55:09
You could have just as easily not got the bitcoins back depending on the merchant.


As opposed to never getting it back at all, which is more than possible with bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-06-26 10:28:48
I fail to see how this is this any different than bitcoin.
high frequency trading is not limited to, or exclusively for, a specific commodity or platform.
@_date: 2015-06-16 20:48:24
can anyone enlighten me as to the actual meaning of the term 'software vote' in this context?
@_date: 2015-06-14 12:08:51
are we really dragging this up again?
the price has been going down steadily for years now, so what?
bitcoin is not about the price its about usability &amp; adoption, jeeez.
@_date: 2015-06-10 16:14:37
if you read between the lines you both are actually agreeing with each other, albeit in a rather aggressive way.

What about lightening side-chains, would they not resolve a lot of the outstanding issues listed above?
@_date: 2015-06-12 17:18:00
can you just send changetip?
@_date: 2015-06-20 16:24:53
weak hands... strong hands...
can we all just have normal everyday hands and be done with it.
@_date: 2015-06-19 07:38:18
for face to face trades in dark alleys with nervous strangers there's bitcoin, 
for everything else there's mastercard.
@_date: 2015-06-14 12:11:49
my heart go out to you man, 
these people really put you through the grinder.
@_date: 2015-05-09 23:28:49
I would say it was just the lighting.
There is no way a shower would cause only one arm to appear red.
@_date: 2015-05-31 19:31:15
it ain't fresh vegetables either.
@_date: 2015-01-19 19:05:58
I beg to differ, has quite alot of serious analysis and often offers assistance to users who feel a little put off by the evermore aggressive nature of Maybe your experience there was not up to par, but honestly I have to say my overall impression of 'over there' is way more chilled and reasoned than what I tend to experience here.
@_date: 2015-05-31 20:37:09
its no use trying to reason, 
were dealing with a creationist level belief system here.
@_date: 2015-01-04 22:51:12
apparently not.
@_date: 2015-01-14 01:11:16
Changing the top pic to SELL may more accurately reflect the current situation.
@_date: 2015-07-02 17:32:12
Honestly, put your money in euros in a bank account outside greece.
@_date: 2015-07-19 00:21:42
Sorry for my loss....
@_date: 2015-07-02 17:12:08
excellent retort, well that certainly put me in my place.
@_date: 2015-07-02 19:30:21
Have fun tomorrow!
@_date: 2015-07-03 13:00:09
It does get a little trying after a while.
@_date: 2015-07-02 17:36:52
thanks Obama...
@_date: 2015-07-02 18:04:18
Ah, you have piqued my interest.
What is this 'order-type' you are referring to?
[don't you just love slow work days]
@_date: 2015-07-02 17:47:23
Yes, I did.
You mean type of order like Stop Loss?
@_date: 2015-07-02 17:24:24
No you did not.
I was referring to a general concept as opposed to your specific response.
Regardless, donations made on good faith should at least be used by the recipient for activities related to the purpose of the donation.
Is it just me or is there something fundamentally dishonest taking donations for one purpose and using them for another.
But then again, this is Bitcoin, where there [may be] some noble traits, but honesty certainly is not one of them.
 
@_date: 2015-07-02 18:22:50
I would have been more attentive if I knew there was a quiz afterwards :)
No worries, if you don't want to say thats OK, just asking...
Looks like order-type may just be the mythical 'order type' found on many a Bitcoin exchange:


That would be like a 'stop loss' or something.
It's actually Thur, but a slow thur :)
@_date: 2015-07-02 17:41:32
the irony of your retort is breathtaking
@_date: 2015-09-27 15:55:49
6 of 1...
@_date: 2015-09-12 16:20:40
highly unlikely though.
@_date: 2015-09-24 07:23:53
Watch out Circle.
What goes around comes around.
@_date: 2015-09-13 13:49:54
Protocols, by their very nature, need to be explicit.
As such should be devoid of any level of ambiguity.
The protocol design though would have the capability to explicitly require the use case [monetary/non-monetary].
Implementing a feature in Bitcoin which explicitly requires declaration that the transfer is non-monetary would save a lot of headaches [and sfyl posts] related to this significant issue.
This really is not rocket science, just carefully crafted design.
As mentioned earlier, this [the lack of safeguards] has been raised before, but for some reason, features which would improve, secure and give Bitcoin a higher level of acceptability and trust as a protocol are not given the weight they deserve.
@_date: 2015-09-12 00:23:38
In all seriousness, why on earth can it be that a 4.6 BTC fee can accidentally be paid in a transaction?
Surely there must be some practical way of ensuring that this type of nonsense does not occur?
@_date: 2015-02-15 17:56:05
freemarket, yeahhh~!
