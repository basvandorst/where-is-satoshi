Sometimes it's more about ability rather than skill. I can sell coins to friends and family living in Asia because I have a bank account in my homecountry, and a bank account in the UK where I can easily buy coins. I charge for my time and i think that's fair.

can you explain because I don't quite understand. If say I buy a house using Bitcoin, it will devalue Bitcoin? That's ironic
@_date: 2014-09-18 17:34:39
That's what we don't know yet

I don't live in a country with capital gain tax so I have a question.
What if you hold your coins in an anonymous address and then gift the BTC to yourself. Would you still have to pay tax?

But then won't your money shoot up in price as well? Sounds like it's very easy to game the system here

I gave you an up vote because of spite

Post propaganda and up votes himself? Get enough up votes and mob mentality unfortunately sustains it
@_date: 2014-08-18 13:07:20
I'm interested in your concept. How would vote coin work?
@_date: 2014-09-08 16:49:15
Can you elaborate?

If its not too much trouble, can you explain why it will tank the price, and why it even matters? Wouldn't 500k traded between the community technically be better than 500k hoarded by one person?

Do any of them serve neighboring countries of Philippines? There isn't a rich Bitcoin community where I'm from and I would like to trade with Bitcoin

I do. Although I'm a student and my life saving is only like £600. Learning about cold storing is actually what motivated me into investing funds for my future.
