Now compare it to dollar inflation:
which is up more like 300% since 2000, with no rate of slowing. Which is about 8% annually.

Because i have some passive income from the bitcoins i own (poloniex lending), and i bought most of the coins near the end of 2016, i'm not so worried about price fluctuations. I float about 1k cash in my bank account, it goes over that, turn into bitcoin, goes below 300, sell some bitcoin.
Usually just a steady flow into bitcoin though.

I use bitcoin as a savings account. buy with all excess money from paycheck, sell when i have unexpected expenses/ large one-time expenses.

Usually use bitonic for buying and selling conveniently.
The bitcoins are usually on poloniex being loaned out to margin traders to get me more passive income.

No matter what the method to generate them is, people will eventually start investing into it and maximize their profits (until competition is fierce). No matter what the method is, slightly less fiat will spent mining than is earned.
However, if you look at it as you do, you might think, why not burn fiat directly (proof of burn), so there is no need for using actual resources?
1: Because the government is in charge of fiat, this would give them a far more direct attack surface.
2: With mining, you don't just need to pay for electricity, you also need to invest in the ASIC miners themselves. This makes it very expensive to attack bitcoin, because an attack will make all the ASIC miners you just bought worthless.
3: The way mining works is just damn convenient. it's provably fair, international, transparent, and not easily manipulated.

If i were to sell a large amount i would probably use one of the exchanges so i get the best possible price. volume in bitcoin is definitely high enough that this shouldn't be a problem, just make sure you can get your fiat out conveniently.

I'm pretty sure bitonic is netherlands only, they are essentially a very straightforward way to buy sell/bitcoins, not even an account required. you would probably want to sign up to one of the large exchanges and buy there, especially if you want any of the coins coinbase doesn't offer.

Technically, it's net worth that's taxed, and that includes value of property. So if they noticed 50k being spent on a 100 inch tv that would still be taxed.

I live in the netherlands, we pay tax once yearly on the amount of capital we own at the start of the year. (very reasonable amount).
Way less tax headaches here.

Someone just sold off 1000 bitcoin in one sell order and the wall got pulled, guessing someone is retiring.

2.75 million with a 2% SWR (very, very conservative), Gives you 55k per year.
Compare that to the gross median HOUSEHOLD income of US:
which is 44k per year.
No it won't let you live it big in the middle of san francisco, but if you can't retire on this you're not even trying.
