Sure seems that way.

Coinbase is cancer.  I waited 10 days for a debit card purchase to go through.  It never did and customer support is non-existent.  After calling their support line and staying on hold or 30 minutes, their response was "You'll just have to wait until it goes through."  No response to emails.  No response to tweets.  I finally cancelled my debit card, ordered a new one, and did the purchase instantly on Bitstamp.

I'm not sure what you mean.  I've been doing all of my purchases on the Coinbase iPhone app.

Exactly this.

Best explanation I've heard yet.
@_date: 2017-11-11 18:04:59
It worked!

It’s almost more than I can Handel.

So, to dumb it down, the hard fork is happening or it's not happening?

Thank you.
@_date: 2017-11-10 14:41:27
Ugh.  That's ridiculous.
@_date: 2017-11-11 18:23:24
Thanks for this.  As a relative newb, I was watching all this and thinking, "Wow, I should really sell BTC and buy some Bitcoin Cash!"  You talked me out of it.

They are not reliable.  I made a debit card Bitcoin purchase on 11/2.  Today is 11/9 and it still shows as "pending."  Customer support is non-existent.

It's my fault.  I transferred some funds from my investment account over to Bitcoin.  It's kind of like washing your car on a sunny day.  It guarantees a rain storm will follow shortly thereafter.
