20x the cost, also 20x the reward. Hashrate follows price.

Lol. You say smoothed out like routing is trivial. It is an impossible problem that cannot be solved in its current form. You wait and see how bad it gets when it's more than a few experimenters making payments.

One of the fundamental advantages of cryptocurrencies is that it is trustless. The internet, with its bgp, functions by everyone trusting everyone else to do the right thing, e.g routing my packets directly to the destination without tampering or inspecting what I'm doing. The service providers are king, they can, and on occasion have gone bad.
This also happens to be very similar to how our traditional banking system works across the world. One of the key reasons bitcoin was created and gained traction was that it allowed us to move our money as far away from a system like that as possible.
Lighting currently gets around the trust issue by having the sender build the entire route, and then using onion encryption around the hops.
The problem with this method is it just can't be scaled on the 'idealogical' network layout. It can however potentially be scaled while the network has a small amount of hubs with many spokes, i.e a simple layout  (more like the physical layout of the internet, but even simpler).
Although I believe lightning style channels and even small networks will have good uses, having the whole world on one lightning network is ridiculous and can't work without taking away the primary reasons we use cryptocurrencies in the first place. There are many fundamental problems that just get hand waved away or people just don't realize they exist in the first place. For example no fees going miners is a huge problem in the long term.
Ending my rant here before I write a book about the subject.

My point is I do not believe there will ever be a large scale lightning solution with good performance, cost, and reliability, that doesn't sacrifice any of cryptocurrencies key traits or jeopardise the underlying blockchain, be it bitcoin or otherwise. Channel state and node fee's just add too much to the routing equation.
- Funds being vulnerable if your node goes down
- Trusting and paying a 'watchtower' to prevent the above
- Losing the built in immutable ledger from the blockchain
- Paying wealthy hubs for existing instead of miners for doing work
- Many more trust/centralisation issues that could arise from scaling solutions
If you have any info on scaling models that a. work, and b. are trustless, and for bonus points c. decentralised, I'd love to learn about it.

And tell me what percentage of the hashrate is behind core nodes?
@_date: 2019-05-17 06:47:06
This is a lie.
  
Transactions that are in the mempool for two weeks get dropped (Core implementation). This is irrespective of the size of the mempool, or what else is in there.

And what of the BSV nodes that don't experience any issues until 100+MB? Their network handles 4MB blocks without any problems at all.

So it's settled then. The vision of bitcoin is to eject tx's from the mempool after two weeks.
