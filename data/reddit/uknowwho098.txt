If you’re concerned about fees buy and sell on gdax not coinbase (same company)
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:45:46
It seems very coincidental that the second some bad news happens (Korean exchange hack) coinbase adds in bcash onto their platform. They have attacked bitcoin before in a pump and dump scheme (pump to try and get bcash to become the main fork of bitcoin, dump when they realize they couldn’t) and that was when the prices of the two were much closer than they are now. So it would seem like the founders of bcash have partnered w coinbase to capitalize on the small dip, having all the panic sellers put their money into bcash.

Made my account in January. Around May my account was locked and support was nonexistent. Sent emails all the time, nothing. It was frustrating that I couldn’t sell or buy and I was missing out on huge fluctuations. My account wasn’t unlocked until OCTOBER. I switched to gemini+bittrex in June and it was the best thing I could have done. Coinbase is to sketchy and honestly only cares about making money at the expense of their customers.

Really gdax is the exchange and coinbase is a wallet. If you buy and sell through coinbase they charge you like 6x more in fees. The hate is coming from the crappy service, accounts being locked for no reason while getting no help from coinbase staff. People not being able to verify accounts, verified accounts having to be reverified after they just bought bitcoin for seeming no reason at all. 
The timing of bcash being added to coinbase was very sketchy. Korean exchange got hacked, leading to BTC price dip/panic. Shortly after bcash just appeared on Coinbase with no prior announcement seem very coincidental. Causing all the panic sellers to pump their money into bcash. Very very sketchy stuff. I would not recommend coinbase to anyone.

DOGE 
Thinking of getting some iota
@_date: 2017-12-23 21:17:01
I think the value will go up. It’s up 30% past 24hr 
@_date: 2017-12-24 03:43:17
It’s the exchange coinbase uses, they charge you extra fees for interface I guess 6x more I think 
@_date: 2017-03-05 16:05:32
Very helpful thank you!
@_date: 2017-03-04 21:51:21
Can someone explain what this means and the effect it would have on bitcoin prices? 
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:54:38
I’ve been telling people coinbase is ass all year. Buy on Gemini, put in a hardware wallet. Simple as that.

A lot of people think it’s “shares of bitcoin” I keep explaining to them it’s a currency. It can be split up. You can buy $100 worth of bitcoin if you wanted.

I bought bitcoin when it hit $1000 and it dropped to $800 so just let that be a lesson. I hodled ofc
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:30:53
Go through a direct exchange. I use Gemini for bitcoin/ethereum. You can also use gdax which is the exchange owned by coinbase but minus the fees for the wallet/app for bitcoin/ethereum/litecoin.  I did the math the other day. Coinbase charges 6x more fees than making a purchase directly from an exchange. 
+ not to mention coinbase locked my account over the summer for 3 months due to a mistake on their end and I could not get it resolved.

I’ve been able to buy BTC with eth and ltc w no trouble at all
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:56:53
Idk how long you’ve been watching coinbase but I’ve been using them for around a year now and yes, it does help bring popularity, but the fees are such a rip off to any newbie getting into cryptos. If they have the precedent that cryptos cost that much it’s can also be a deterrent. To me it just feels like such a rip off.
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:16:09
Hodl man wait a bit for the pump and dump to end 
@_date: 2017-04-26 21:36:40
"Any one can apply is false, I applied and got rejected"... you still applied though. Nowhere did I say everyone would be accepted.

Depends if ya linked to savings or checkings acct
@_date: 2017-05-04 22:02:42
I think if you buy through checking acct you don't have to wait the 3-5 days. But lower limits ofc 
@_date: 2017-05-04 21:58:24
Go on the site and talk to the AI help chat they will ask for your email and prioritize it. Should hear back within 24 hours.
@_date: 2017-05-05 04:25:18
If you're going to buy, hold it. I.e. Don't think of BTC as quick cash. It's an investment, which is a gamble and has risk. If you are comfortable with having that money depreciate then you can risk it going up. So far the BTC market has been very bull so.
@_date: 2017-05-24 20:29:23
Same I was going to sell my eth and ltc a couple days ago now it's up A LOT. Still want my account fixed tho
@_date: 2017-05-04 19:43:01
I first bought $1 of BTC for a couple weeks before I invested more. I feel like once you own it you can see how it effects what you have and make u more confident with future investments.
@_date: 2017-06-26 11:30:26
I've had a lot of issues with coinbase. I'd look into gemini if I were you. For example my account has been locked for a month and a half because of an error on their end. And their support is terrible.
