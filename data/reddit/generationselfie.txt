I have a bad feeling you're right. I'm basically scraping the breadcrumbs off of the floor of an enormous global bakery.
However, my hard-earned .7¢ says otherwise! /s

Yaay! I get my first-ever margarine call this morning from Kraken. I mean, I'd only had $.28 invested, but to have it go down to $.23 in a night really sucks. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Genesis has seemed very sketchy, even among other cloud mining services. I've always thought hashflare *seemed* sorta legit, but still not gonna drop any dough into it.

Damn. Seeing posts like this makes me really hope I strike it rich on an altcoin some day.

Yeah, my total holdings are not even $100. I'm putting what I can into it so I can maybe walk away someday with a nice car or a house paid for.

Sweet! I can average down.

You take that back about my beloved cola

It's just sad that even if it stays at current prices, for an average person it would takes years and years of steady purchases just to buy one bitcoin. Even though you can buy in at any amount, I think there's something sad about the fact that most young people can't afford a single bitcoin at this point.

Obv I'm going to keep buying in. But other people have seen 10x-20x gains, even over just the last 15-18 months. I could totally have that happen to me.

Damn, I hope this or ETH comes down hard enough for a better entry. I’d just love for Bitcoin to move under $1000 again so I can get rich on the gain train.

Oh, I know. The deal is that I’m just a little skeptical about the whole “global mass adoption” thing. But I still want the chance to have massive returns on bitcoin or another crypto, like all the people who dropped a hundred bucks into it back in 2013 and are now sitting on tens of thousands of dollars.

Thanks! Yeah, I bought about .1 ETH through my blockchain walls a few days ago. Enough that if eth turns to shit I can stand the loss,  but enough if it sees bitcoin-level returns I can wag my finger and say “I told you so.”

I'm worth six cents right now. Yay me.

Time to average down, boys.

n00b here. After another two or three halvings, when mining returns become negligible, would it ever be possible that more bitcoins would be created if a way was found to do so without excessive inflation?

Sweet! Thank you.
