How do you guys hold onto bitcoins? The dank weed and coke calls. Anonymously.

open source is good except for in situations where someone stands to benefit from deceiving you. Again, I'm no programmer, so I have no way of verifying between a legit piece of open source software that does exactly what it says and that only and a piece of software that does most of what it says but slowly steals from me in an unknowable way or hell for all we know they exit scam after 10 years of being a good company. It's the same reason I can't use a password keeper. How the fuck am I supposed to trust a password keeper with every password?
Decentralization as a concept only works partially rn.

this is why i stopped using bitcoin. I'm not a programmer so how am I supposed to trust a software wallet that I didn't design. It seems like kind of a huge problem. For all I know you are shilling rn throwing out 3 good ones and 1 shill app designed for ripping people off.

Upvote so that people that are smarter than me can tell me what to think about this.

Holy shit! What awesome news!
I presume this means we NEED to launder our coins in some way rather than transferring them to SR?
@_date: 2012-03-12 14:58:29
Yea this was cool to read on the nytimes. I can't wait for my boss (whom I have had many arguments about the legitimacy and future of bitcoin with) to see this article on such a well established publication!

Canadian Black ops, eh? Those mounties are ruthless...

They claim that bank transfers happen over night - much faster than dwolla.
I really hope mt. gox or some other btc dealer starts accepting this service.
Edit: Seriously, does anyone know if mt gox is planning on using this service?

wat is happening? lol @ this situation.
@_date: 2012-10-26 15:37:40
Op, dafuq are you talking about?
Fucking troll. 
Edit: You are an idiot, the government does not give things value, markets give things value.

How awesome would it be if blizzard paid out the real money auction house with bitcoin.
&lt;3 I can dream.
@_date: 2012-03-13 17:12:50
Someone with money has figured out how great BTC is. However, is it not worrisome that a single entity could theoretically control the market - simply by having the capital to buy up vast chunks of available bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-01-09 19:13:20
Na you will stop shilling for literal billionaires rubbing there hands together and delighting at every mass shooting that happens?
@_date: 2019-01-09 23:20:46
what rights? What is it what are they doing speak up
trust me when someone starts talking about evil billionaires i listen. lets hear it

the gun my great granddad gave my granddad gave me is just as deadly as any gun manufactured in the past 40 years. Keep giving your time and money to naked profiteers sounds good.
@_date: 2019-01-09 23:18:30
What that someone is trying to take your guns? If you are serious that is a seriously paranoid delusion. Noone is or ever will take your guns. "Gun control" is a discussion about future gun sales. Just in case you like somehow literally misunderstood the context of the whole conversation. 
Explain to me what gun rights politicians are trying to take away. Like what specific rights
@_date: 2019-01-08 23:53:28
buying expensive excessive unnecessary guns doesn't make you a libertarian or a revolutionary it makes you an exploited consumer.
there are more rifles than people in this country, all production of firearms could completely stopped and everyone in north america would be fine.
A rifle and a box of bullets should be a once a lifetime purchase or just handed on down.
You chucklefucks are pawns to gun manufacturers bottom lines out there defending muh guns muh sovereignty. Fucking get a life.

What the hell does the fraudulent Trump campaign have to do with the so called "gun rights" politicians are after. Were basic "gun rights" to be changed it would be congress that did it as that would be an amendment. 
Hillary would have been a real president. She was talking about socialized health care and green new jobs back in the early 90s. I still don't understand why half the country literally sperged out about her.

It's funny because what you are trying to accuse me of you are actually guilty of. Like is NRA blog your homepage? Widen the sources from which you obtain your information.
You actually think that whether or not you can buy unlimited guns and ammo is a gun right. A gun right is being able to own a gun not being able to nakedly profit off warfighting equipment. It's the same thing with the DoD and all the contractors. You people are brainwashed by the military industrial complex I feel bad for you. They won't find me come draft time. I'll be smokin weed in the mountains with the heady folks while you fight fascists wars.
If bushmaster remington colt and all the gun manufactures were dismantled today for their crimes against humanity it would only be a good thing for you retards in the gun industry if you thought about it for a second. All the sudden small boutique companies will have a fighting chance and maybe you chucklefucks will have a little small business boom or something but nooo its give me my bloodied corpo-fascist warlords or give me death!!
BTW noone ever has suggested taking your buttplugs I mean firearms away from you dipshit. That's how I know you have shit sources.

Yea I'd say you aren't conservative. Neo-liberal boot licker more like.
@_date: 2013-04-03 16:48:45
Man, I should try telling myself that. I've used $10k worth of &lt;$10 bitcoins. 
@_date: 2013-01-09 17:46:41
I showed a couple of county detectives the silk road and bitcoin when I was in jail for a weekend on drug charges. They approached me like they do every person in on drug charges to see if they could get an easy informant.
I explained cryptography, encryption, cryptocurrency, and how there was absolutely nothing law enforcement can do to stop or even catch intelligent people.
They were really floored by it and they said that they don't really have a problem with computer nerds getting high-quality drugs this way. They said that they are in the business to protect people from mexican gangs and organized crime which distribute drugs to make money.

My prosecutor (The DA) for the same case was really cool too. I wish I would have filmed what he said to me to share.
He told me that he enjoys a scotch after a hard day at work and that he does not judge me for using cannabis or mushrooms. He said that he doubts things are going to change in his lifetime but he said that he has a lot of faith in my generation and smiled as he said that we [my generation] will be able to change things.
