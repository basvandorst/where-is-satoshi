It's sort of bittersweet. Compared to [Bitcoins.com]( or [WeUseCoins.com]( or even [Bitcoin.org]( it's not that informative or attractive. This is maybe looking at the glass half empty, but highlighting any of the above websites (or even none) might have been better.

I was taught it at school too; it's not grammatically wrong (or right). But it is rare you see it on the internet, and it was something quite distinguishable about Satoshi's BitcoinTalk posts. None of Dorian's other ones have that double space, but this early one uniquely does. And has much improved English. 
His ones from recent years frequently have terrible English, one of them even includes the phrase "the rust u don't c". But in 2004 his English included sentences like:
"It looks like a thermos bottle with a medium sized pipe looping out of it's [sic] front.  This is an important unique piece with the Y6b operation, simple to compound switching."
"Have broadsided (not 3/4 or superposed view) prototype photo that's big enough and exposed well to see under the running board details?"
His English isn't as good as Satoshi's was, so it's still unlikely it's him (I'm not trying to sensationalise this). But it *is* a curveball considering all his other posts uncovered.

Before everyone gets too caught up fingering themselves to their libertarian ideals, if you actually take a step to properly read and understand the pdf there's nothing bad in the slightest on the press release.. if anything it's actually good news.
They're basically just holding an open public hearing as a "fact-finding effort", similar to the senate hearings. Nothing more.


It's not the conclusion of a behind closed doors investigation or the culmination of some sketchy backhanders to screw over bitcoin, it's the people who regulate financial services bringing in some Bitcoin-related people to ask what their thoughts are, in an open environment. You can go down there, the press can go down there, anyone can down there.
The "BitLicense" idea is used in one sentence as a theoretical "NYDFS issuance" for virtual currency *businesses*. For anyone who watched the senate hearings a recurring theme was jumping through the hoops of regulation can be hard; if anything their idea looks to be something simple that places Bitcoin-related *businesses* in their own unique lane when registering as a money transmitter in NY.
As a community we need to stop jumping to conclusions all the time, and whenever an issue rears its head actually take the time to understand it before spouting off.

@_date: 2014-01-11 07:45:36
People already have to have licenses if they act as a money transmitting business, but the current ones aren't designed with Bitcoin in mind and they're supposed to be quite elaborate to apply for if you're new to that sort of thing.
A BitLicense, aka a registration specifically catered for Bitcoin businesses could make things much easier.

To the people saying this makes them think more so that Dorian is Satoshi: think about it for a minute.
The real Satoshi is likely a conscientious person, and seeing some poor 64-year old guy with health problems who just wants his privacy being hounded to fuck and potentially having his life turned upside down must be strange. Media parked outside his house, mass national attention, people (including all of us) examining every part of his life..
Never before has this happened on this scale.
We're at a time where anything happening with Bitcoin makes international news. Every day. It's happened so slowly that, I at least, almost don't realise it. And then some old unrelated guy gets unwittingly thrown into the centre of that vortex, with the real Satoshi watching from the sidelines.
Satoshi had the ability to confirm that he isn't the person being harassed *and* still maintain his complete privacy and anonymity.
@_date: 2014-01-29 00:34:43
The transparency of the Bitcoin network is a very good thing for everyone. Satoshi designed it that way for a reason. If everything was pitch black under the hood it holds the idea back. Bitcoin offers complete transparency and complete privacy in *equal* measures.
The fact that it's possible for anti-money-laundering folk to look at the blockchain just as much as anyone on reddit shows how powerful the idea is; in the future you can imagine visualisations of the world economy at large in real-time. Whereas you could never even prove a legitimate transaction ever happened in one of these upcoming darkcoins, and ultimately, the people who are going to be led to that idea are the people that none of us want to use it.
The privacy of Bitcoin is more than anyone really needs; it's complete privacy *to a point*, and the only way your transactions are going to be linked to you is with a great effort of scrutiny specifically putting you under the microscope.
@_date: 2014-02-18 22:15:47
This is a really important well written article. If all the diehard libertarian fanatics were to read this maybe they would gain some perspective outside their one-note gov-hating bubble.
Bitcoin was *always* going to require some regulation around the edges. With Lawsky, Bitcoin has truly fell into the safest pair of hands it could have hoped for. It hasn't fell into the hands of someone like Putin or Cheney, it's fell into the hands of someone who is openly optimistic about it, wants to truly understand it and engage with supporters of it, and even seems to have a sense of humour about the Super Nintendo meme. Lawsky is friend.

I used to read his blog regularly and really like twobit. Now he comes off as someone lost up his own ass and completely unable to admit it to himself.
There is a clear distinct parallel between him and Leah that he is unable to see. A lot of it is the language he uses; he's very articulate when he wants to be, but these days there's this self-aggrandising OTT tone, and a lot of what seems like trying to draw attention to himself (never mind the fact he sold all his bitcoins anyway, pssh).
Right now it's almost like he's *trying* to do unnecessary damage to Bitcoin, at a time when everything news-wise is shaky and misunderstandings plague the headlines. *Not* by the act of releasing documents that he says are important, but by the hoopla that he's making of it. This isn't 24.
If we see resignations by Jon and Peter tomorrow it would be very surprising, and he knows that, but it seems he almost wants the media hurrah of going on all the news stations, and taking part in discussions about "corruption at the head of Bitcoin" as it will no doubt be reported as.
All rather than doing the legit journalistic thing of coming together with the trustworthy journos at CoinDesk and discussing the best way to go about reporting on the documents.

I'm not sure if we're on the same link, but yes, I have read the content of that link. And many others of Dorian's, and many many of Satoshi's BitcoinTalk forum posts. As I've said, his English even here is not as impeccable as Satoshi's was, Satoshi's was flawless. But compared to Dorian's others it is markedly different. And the usage of double-spacing also stands out as different from all others by him.
On his Yahoo post he does use double-spacing. After every full stop (and subsequent start of a new sentence) he begins with two spaces. Nowhere else does he do this.

I agree, but then that's *if* it's banned. Which it won't be.
One important thing I've always thought about is how much bitcoin would benefit business. From the smallest family run businesses to the biggest of the big corporations. Bitcoin has every characteristic that businesses would love, and the second the big dogs realise they can float their cash seamlessly across states, countries, accounts freely and without anyone else's say so or taking a cut; bitcoin's got some of the biggest most influential bulls on its side.
The more regular businesses accepting and regular people using, and the more money VCs, tech companies, investors, and wall street funnel into bitcoin the greater the chance attempts to impede its growth will be stopped themselves.
Although tbh I don't think China is moving towards banning it. They've invested waaay too much time fucking *promoting* bitcoin on state television. It's hard to know exactly what their plan is.

Concurring what a couple of others have said; I think if you can gather more information which makes it absolutely unequivocally 100% certain it is the person that actually stole the coins in the first place then it would be fair/right to share considering he runs a Bitcoin business.
But if he runs a Bitcoin-related business someone could have very easily bought something from him or made a transaction with him using the stolen coins.

I couldn't agree more with this post. Really well written.
I don't see how Litecoin adoption or Litecoin being in the limelight comes with anything positive for Bitcoin or advancing cryptocurrency in general.
Ultimately, the Bitcoin source code must have taken years of foresight and an incredible amount of intelligence and understanding of cryptography and economics to even contemplate the full-scale idea, and then a huge undertaking in itself for Satoshi to literally put the plan into action and write the code -which some programmers have said would have probably taken around two years full-time to come up with the first version. Insane levels of genius work and no-one even knew about it. And the outcome changed everything. To be frank, Litecoin *is* nothing more than a copy paste of that with a few tweaks, coupled with some marketing. The comparison in the big picture is almost non-existent.
@_date: 2013-05-05 03:02:52
In response to the second section; I don't think for one second Satoshi was worried about a commercial bank spotting Bitcoin and trying to perform a 51% double spend/attack on the Bitcoin network. Bitcoin was in it's early beta stages, they were worth pennies and not in any real sort of financial use at that time I don't think.

Don't know why people are complaining about this as though Android is the answer for everything. Apple's stance is shit but JasonBored's post is bang on point, and what he's saying is right.
Tim Cook has said in his interviews that although he gets hundreds of emails every day he tries to read as many as he humanly can, and has been known to reply to emails in the past also. Just like Steve Jobs.
A constructive cordial email that's actually *read* by the man will do a lot, and could actually alert him to something he may not have paid too much attention to within Apple. I'm not saying he's unaware, but Bitcoin is still small and he might not have advancing Apple's approach as a priority.
It's a win-win, and the guy's known for being a workaholic. A well-reasoned sincere letter could do a lot.

At first I had thoughts very similar to fantasticsid, but after spending an hour going through the details and reading the whole thing it makes more sense, and comes back something like this:
* Undercover was in contact with DPR for 8 full months, under the premise of being a drug smuggler dealing with high quantities of drugs.
* After 8 months of contact he said to DPR that the buyers on Silk Road only seem to want what he considers small amounts and that it's not becoming worth it for him selling anything under very large quantities like 10 kilos of cocaine.
* DPR asked his hired administrator SR Support (who'd been hired for a month) to canvass around for someone willing to buy large quantities of cocaine.
* SR Support came back and contacted the undercover and DPR saying he'd found a vendor who would be willing to purchase substantial quantities and that he'd forward the supplied address to the seller (undercover).
* The feds came through to deliver personally I believe, neither the buyer nor the seller trusting the USPS, and subsequently busted the buyer.
* The **big** twist was that was that the buyer of the cocaine SR Support had "found" was *actually* SR Support himself.
* SR Support got busted for wanting to buy mass quantities of cocaine and, supposedly, blackmailed DPR. DPR not linking the cocaine sale as the reason for his arrest, as SR Support never insinuated he was the buyer.
* The undercover then got in on the double whammy and offered to kill SR Support who was going to turn informant.
* Although at that time it still looks like they didn't actually know who DPR was. But they had a murder charge to pin on him.

I don't know why this was downvoted, it's correct. There's been some really interesting pieces on this at Bitcoin Magazine and Coindesk.
I've seen numerous other things from Chinese sources here on Reddit saying that really long and positive Bitcoin reports and news pieces on Chinese state media is a *very* definitive stamp of approval. China want to get away from the world reliance on the dollar and everything that brings, kinda like Ron Paul and his "sound money" thing. Bitcoin has coincidentally given China their first opportunity to do that.
Something that could affect the economics of China so potentially greatly hasn't been given the full steam ahead by state media without the state on board. It's no accident, they see the potential.

I think one of the biggest things that will hold back Bitcoin and crypotcurrencies is ourselves. Altcoin speculators who don't want any bad publicity coming their way don't realize how big a detriment they are.
Satoshi created an idea so radically new it has birthed something that can create a true revolution in money that can truly benefit the world. We can't be at war with ourselves. The money you have to make from speculating on some random altcoin is needless. It's the time where we choose whether we want to try and get rich supporting the millionth random altcoin, or support something that deep down we probably all believe in.
The Bitcoin speculation aspect is there to be enjoyed by all of us, but I would give up every one of my Bitcoins for it to truly succeed. I genuinely believe that if there is one thing that will hold us all back, it will be altcoin speculators trying to shit on Bitcoin and big up a random altcoin.

Am I the only one who doesn't think this is *that* bad?
It's not a deal cut with anyone, it's an anonymous ask on an exchange, no one will be losing any bitcoins.. is that right? If he'd already got bitcoins and was going to screw someone that would truly be 100% wrong, but if he hasn't received the bitcoins yet..
It's been standard practice across the board at all the exchanges to cancel bids from before the price drop; if someone had an outstanding bids at $250 pre-drop it was being cancelled as standard practice after the price had plummeted.
Only stupid thing though is that at the steady and stable rate bitcoin price has been increasing over the past couple of days it will be $112 probably within a few days anyway.

Truthfully though, you're only interested in Litecoin for speculation. That's the only reason you want it to succeed, not because it could potentially do something vast and revolutionary and positive to the world like Bitcoin can. You're the *exact* same as all of the wall street big shots, if not a smidgen worse. You understand what digital currency could mean for the future, and then you still back the one that offers no good, other than you making money.
Ages ago I read about Litecoin and made the assumption that investing some in, purely for speculation, I could make a bit of money if it goes up. I decided against it because of the fear that I could become anything like some of the confused people on this reddit; who recognise there's *nothing* positive about Litecoin but still downvote criticism of it, just because they want to make a return. Then there's the others who try to argue for cryptocurrency as all or nothing. Ultimately, Litecoin success doesn't improve Bitcoin's success.. it's detrimental and halts it if anything.

I've been reading and re-reading this post and response now for about 10 minutes trying to figure out what's going on.
zimmah's post is bang on. It acknowledges bitcoin is rough around the edges right now for a lot of people, but it will evolve like the internet has over the past twenty years. But every time it moves substantially up in upvotes it plummets back down to a minus in a single refresh, within seconds. Strange.
Ninja's post would seem to agree that obviously the internet has evolved, as we obviously aren't using Minitel... but it's not agreeing at all. It seems what he's actually saying is Bitcoin is Minitel and the early worm, and a second mouse will take its cheese. I don't get this entire post tbh.
What's even weirder.. is that although X.25 was very rudimentary it was developed *after* the basis of the modern internet; TCP/IP. So the bird/mouse bitcoin/successor analogy is flawed to begin. As is why it's being upvoted..

This is quite a weird article. The guy is clearly smart, but he keeps using the word "progressive" in a weird unusual context.
Also, after all his huffing and puffing he ultimately comes to the conclusion that it is NOT Bitcoin that will overthrow the dollar or any "cyberspace" currency. But it will be currencies that exist in the "real world" like silver, gold, metals and diamonds. He seems quite smart in the big picture, but I just think some older people have trouble understanding the huge benefits and realities of anything that's solely digital. It's almost as though they just need it to be tied to something, if not tied to some physical metal, then tied to a government decree.

Wow. This is so culturally important, I can't believe it was a front cover. To anyone who doesn't get the relevance; the first ever block mined, the genesis block, contains that text:


According to Bitcoin wiki as well




It looks as though Satoshi made the genesis block unspendable because he was the only one capable of mining it.
Always thought this was one of the most important yet ignored clues to Satoshi's origin as well. The fact that the headline of a British newspaper is embedded in the genesis block is kind of significant. Bitcoin could have gone nowhere, it's unlikely he was placing false cues to his location at such an early stage.

Fuck. I've been running Bitcoin-Qt on my Macbook Pro whenever I'm using it for the past year to *help the network*... sigh, I wondered why I always seemed to have 8 active connections.
I've just opened up port 8333 on my router and still not getting any more than 8 active connections. In Qt's preferences there's a toggle for "Map port using UPnP", and whether it's on or off I still get just 8. Although after doing some research I don't think UPnP has ever been supported by Macs so I'm not sure why it's there in the first place (and ticked by default!). Weird.
Can anyone help? I'm on a Mac with OS X 10.9 and got an Airport Extreme router.

I think it's a misconception that the government want to defend the banking system. The current banking system, up until Bitcoin, has ultimately been the only option. But banks everywhere have fucked up, become rife with corruption, caused epidemic problems and cost governments around the world more than they could ever imagine. They've crippled nations with the problems they've created.
Although largely skeptical and apprehensive at first I think when cryptocurrency gets more visible backing, and they see the possibility of freeing themselves from having to bow to private holders who control all the wealth.. governments will take it. Being the banks' bitches hasn't worked out for them. But it will take time. And it will take convincing. But Bitcoin frees citizens as much as it does governments and businesses. The latter two being very important for it thriving.

This conversation reads like a back and forth of the same person considering you're both repeating a very similar, and rare, viewpoint and rhetoric throughout the thread.. essentially..


What you're saying doesn't serve any good purpose, or true purpose, for Bitcoin. It is hyper-paranoid scaremongering.
People running Bitcoin businesses will not be thrown in jail, or (can't believe I actually have to say this) be killed. That is paramount. Regardless of the tin-hat qualities of your perspective there are too many users and investors of Bitcoin already for it to be shut down without too much fuss; big businesses, small businesses, venture capitalists investing big bucks, lawyers, investors, users, all from multiple countries around the world.
Some attempt at a cease and desist after eons of legal wrangling back and forth is the absolute worst case scenario, and I imagine something as heavy-handed would be unlikely due to the almighty dollar and all the money that would sink with it even at this point. Lots of big time speculators and Silicon Valley investing a ton of cash into Bitcoin-related startups would cause beyond issues. Hell, Bloomberg has it's own Bitcoin ticker. Bitcoin is way past a couple of geeks tinkering at this point.
@_date: 2013-12-04 03:20:28
Haha. So true.
I honestly can't believe Litecoin proponents still exist, this couldn't be more right. Its entire worth is in speculation. I understand those that are open to letting others experiment with ideas and try things out, and I agree with them, but really fighting for Litecoin as an actual plausible alternative is so utterly idiotic and problematic.
There isn't a single argument that can't be broken down to shreds about its worth. It provides zero, literally *zero* innovations on Bitcoin, and its dying claim of "we're silver to bitcoin's gold" now rings hollow to anyone half-educated on digital currencies. Bitcoin is divisible. The only reason it's taking off is the same reason some of the other sketchy as hell coins are taking off; people who don't understand digital currency are playing roulette, placing wide bets.

I don't know if this is real, or an advertising ploy. Out of business after one chargeback when you're in the business of selling very pricey rigs starting from $1199 to $2599? Not sure if really makes sense, whatever your margins.
What I can say though is that if you have proof of delivery you WILL get your money get back from PayPal. I was in this exact same situation a few months back, I didn't even know this kind of thing could happen. I was semi-broke so I sold a limited edition valve amp I had on eBay for about £700 (~$1100). Just after the guy signed for it, he did a chargeback with PayPal. PayPal always at this point hold the money to investigate the claim, and as I found out, in 99% of cases if you're a legit seller with all the relevant proof of delivery and the recipients signature (which you do) you're all good. It took about 3 weeks (which is shit and kind of frustrating) but I got my cash back, and I think ultimately you will too.
@_date: 2013-12-08 07:51:37
If that is the one weak link in the chain then I don't think I'll be able to properly seed using Bitcoin-Qt. My modem was a default ISP-supplied one, it's clunky and kind of trippy looking and I truly don't know where to start if I was to mess with its settings. In fact I think it actually came with a sticker that said "DON'T CHANGE SETTINGS".
I can't seed via UPnP as I've just read Macs and Apple devices use NAT-PMP.
It would be good if the devs worked on a way for Qt users to seamlessly and automatically seed as a node without having to undergo things like this. Even having to open a port just to *not* leech off the network is a bit much, most people won't know.

There seems to be a lot of people giving hate to this idea.
Although as it stands it's not necessary the easiest to properly implement flawlessly. I imagine, in a couple of years time especially, that this could be implemented incredibly well. Small iPad or tablet device with an automatically generated QR code is brought to the table, your smartphone scans it, click pay, done.
I don't think worrying about a double spend is of real importance right now. It would take lots of messing around crafting a malicious wallet capable, and for scamming a meal? It would be the same scenario as someone using counterfeit cash, it happens rarely but isn't a major problem.
Ultimately though lots of things are already being worked on, even with the upcoming 0.9 release, to negate the possibility of a double spend. I imagine there will be a lot of things done in the near future and long term future as well to make it even harder or even impossible through one protocol innovation or another.

I'm a happy iPhone user and although this pisses me off I won't be swapping to a Nexus.. yet.
I hate their stance right now, I really do. But I think it's born out of ignorance and a lack of knowing how they're going to go forward with the whole digital currency space. Right now though Apple will be making themselves a lot of ill will due to not knowing how to handle it, and it's catching up to them. As it stands now I still have CoinJar (excellent, still available on the App Store bitcoin wallet), Blockchain, and Coinbase (downloaded before removed) on my phone.
Nexus' are great but going with a random OEM you're just stuck with an unsupported completely abandoned phone that will never be updated again within 6 months to a year which is just terrible. The fragmentation of the Android platform is so bad that no matter how many times it's spoken about, you can't highlight how big a problem it truly is. Google's Chromebooks are awesome, but if Android were Chrome OS then there would be millions of people out there randomly running Chrome 24, 17, 27 etc. all unpatched. That's what the natural equivalent is. Security-wise, that's a nightmare.
Having a Bitcoin wallet on anything other than the most up-to-date version of Android is sketchy, to put lightly. Each version of Android comes with a plethora of security updates, and combats the Android malware issues. It isn't just feature updates. Yet months after Kit Kat's release release only 1.1% are on Android 4.4. Compared to 74% of *all* iOS devices running iOS 7.
I love the side of the Google Play store allowing things like wallets on the store unfettered, but I think that's more down to Google Play's wild-west-anything-goes approach than them having a carefully curated store and allowing them consciously, at least initially. Although at this point it's great they seem cool with it.
I don't think Apple will have a choice in the coming year. Bitcoin is taking off and we've read time and again this whole new space is a big area of interest for Silicon Valley. If in a year's time they still hold the same questionable approach I'd be surprised, and if they do then a Nexus looks like a safe bet.
@_date: 2013-12-08 13:35:00
Security. Although that's only one of many many things, it's just something I've been riffing on. I do reckon that most, if not all, things will come as a natural necessity as bitcoin grows. But yeah.. security.
Banks are prone to corruption, almost everyone in the world acknowledges that at this point. They've fucked up a lot before and they'll fuck up again, but in another way if you were to win the lottery and put your, say, ten million in the bank; most people would probably feel kind of safe having it there. They wouldn't be worried about it day-to-day. With money in the bank most people *generally* would feel safe having it there with all of the insurance and consumer protection and fraud protection, they wouldn't be worried about opening their bank account one day and their account being £0.00 and literally not being able to do *anything* about it. That legal sense that despite all the bank bullshit, your money is *legally* insured in your name.
As it stands now, if someone were to have ten million dollars in Bitcoin they would probably be excited as fuck, but also shit scared. At least I would. Would I just keep it backed up on a hard drive or three? Do I keep it all on paper wallets locked up? Do I keep it on a brain wallet? Do I keep it in Bitcoin-Qt or MultiBit or Electrum? Do I keep it on an exchange? Could I tell anyone about it, or is that asking to be robbed? As someone who's been interested in Bitcoin for a year or two now, I don't know what I would do. I'm not really sure what's the safest most protective route right now for me and I only have a small handful of bitcoins. Not necessarily "Bitcoin banks" are the answer, we are probably going to end up with a diverse amount of answers which is what's so awesome about bitcoin (its versatility). But a lot of people are just too un-technical to really be able to safely secure even a modest amount of money in bitcoin right now.
I think that the more simple and clear and *secure* easy solutions there are for holding and using bitcoin, the more trust and usage will come. Being able to effortlessly flick your friend over a bit of money from phone to phone will always be one of the things that will sell bitcoin, but I don't know where the current mobile security landscape leaves us. Some favour Android because it's open-source but it's also unsupported. Windows XP's security fundamentals are shit but a decade later they're still patching up the sinking boat, if you bought a Samsung last year; no dice.

Not hating as the guy is clearly qualified and is some good brains to add to a team, but I don't see how Litecoin adoption or Litecoin being in the limelight comes with anything positive for Bitcoin or advancing cryptocurrency in general.
Ultimately, the Bitcoin source code must have taken years of foresight and an incredible amount of intelligence and understanding of cryptography and economics to even contemplate the full-scale idea, and then a huge undertaking in itself for Satoshi to literally put the plan into action and write the code - which some programmers have said would have taken more than a year full-time to do. To be frank, Litecoin *is* nothing more than a copy paste of that with a few tweaks, coupled with some good marketing as the first altcoin. I think the comparison in the big picture is almost non-existent.

Not true. Apple has made huge intrinsic upgrades to the security architecture of OS X with Lion and Mountain Lion. There have been really big technical advancements, just like you'd hope with any technology moving forward.
I can remember reading large amounts of comments from major security researchers that have said with Lion and Mountain Lion, Apple really really stepped up their security game and that OS X has become the most secure major operating system.
I don't use Windows, but XP isn't as safer than 7 because it's been around a lot longer and still receives security updates. In fact the complete opposite is true. Its bare fundamental architecture is old and outdated, it's just still receiving band aids over its holes.

On one hand I want to buy Litecoin purely to speculate and maybe make some money if it grows a bit.. but on the other hand Litecoin really is a tailcoat-chasing complete waste of time that I really think will be damaging to Bitcoin in the long run if it ends up getting any mainstream attention. Purely because it causes confusion and to the not aware or non-tech-savvy it could seem as though it's cut from the same cloth as Bitcoin and it's not; it's just a random developer stealing from the open source genius Bitcoin code to create an "alternate currency" that offers nothing new, and trying to cash in on the success of Bitcoin.
I really think if we want Bitcoin to succeed we have to stay away from this. It's a step back in terms of technology and it won't help for the future.

From what I gather they make the point of saying "at this stage" they don't want central banks and financial institutions denominating their products in bitcoin. They want them denominating their products and services in the current legal tender CNY. Businesses, exchanges and individuals appear to be unaffected.
Scaremongering from the likes of Bloomberg and others seems to have done the trick though.
