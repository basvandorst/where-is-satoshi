Honestly? Repost as many videos of Roger Ver acting like Roger Ver on all social media spaces. In my opinion, his natural unlikabilty is bch's biggest weakness, and what is holding back adoption of bch.

Well would you look at that.

Familys getting together talking about purchasing for investmen?. Probably younger folks setting up their elders who want to buy one? Who knows...

Interesting how he doesnt mention BCH in this. He seems to champion Monero as BTC's only rival.

If you dont hold any bitcoin allready, then yes put it in bitcoin. If you already own some, then put it into Verge.

Quick maths.

You will get a greater % and consequently $ return. A verge coin is currently around 10cents. If that grows to a dollar a coin soon ( which is likely) you would do very well. 
Remember- its easier to get from 10cents to 10 dollars, than 100 dollars to 10,000 dollars.

This is pretty much my assumption also.

"Bitcoin is not for everyone."
Strange thing to say when it's success relies on mass adoption...
