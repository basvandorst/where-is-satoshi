I will invest in mid-nov not now:) I will get better price
@_date: 2018-09-15 11:37:01
this is true, leverage is for people who knows exactly what will happen. You can make profits just x2 quicker if price never drop half since you invest. This is not for amatours.

I was there at 2nd floor as well but I couldnt pay by BTC ;P In Sajgon more traded currency is puffsyy ;D 
@_date: 2018-09-15 12:18:58
hmmmm you know...sometimes you can just observe other crypto-exchanges where BTC is the most traded, observe all orderbooks and you can jump (open) as quick as hell with almost no risk (if you see the biggest exchanges they trade BTC at 6000, buy you can buy at 5980. Bitcoin has not one world price in one moment. Using leverage this small amount "scalped" can be good daily profit ;) this is example for more advanced traders who calculate every second

hahahahha dream sellers :D
@_date: 2018-09-15 11:34:18

Bisq.... why could I need it? I like third part ;p This is interesting I can not understand what is wrong with normal exchanges like Bitmex where they just earns on commissions. My strategy is to invest small amounts but very aggresively trying to make 200-300% daily starting from 0,03BTC If I am good trader I can be rich as hell [

We can say that a few days ago Bitmex smashed ETF idea and now is being suspected that gives people tool to mainpulate the market. SEC will not allow for ETF never after this. They killed competitors :D
@_date: 2018-08-27 06:36:20

@_date: 2018-11-04 02:22:31
yep but you can not compare several different scenarios and you can't check what happens when price changes let say 2,5%. Bitmex calculator on their platform is poor and not easy to quickly check and compare different scenarios
@_date: 2018-07-17 08:11:38
the easiest way to lose this people, nothing to gain a lot to lose
@_date: 2018-07-17 03:59:35
Dont worry mate about CME and CBOE as on Bitmex is 10x more volume on futures.  It is always the last Friday. So  28 September and 28 December.
@_date: 2018-07-17 06:33:26
I couldnt agree with you more, what is more decentralized doesnt mean 100% undependent
@_date: 2018-12-14 07:29:26
if you invest now.... at 3250 with leverage 1:20 buying 3-4 BTC you can be millionaire :D  What are you waiting for? :D 
In this Bimtex caclculator, you can do free calculation what IF...  [ It is easy to say it is harder to do and invest :D
