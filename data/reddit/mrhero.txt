Technically they are right. 
@_date: 2018-01-21 04:57:17
Segwit fixes this. Or something. 
@_date: 2018-01-19 14:55:57
His break was long over due. Go ahead and take a break for a while. Maybe a few decades even. 
@_date: 2018-01-29 06:32:48
Just call it bitcoin cash, or bitcoin (BCH). Bcash is a name created by people who would rather resort to name calling rather than facts. 
@_date: 2018-01-05 15:05:13
You do realize that even if every single transaction implemented segwit we would only see an effective blocksize increase of 1.0Mb to 1.3Mb, correct?

Time to start a petition to have it renamed "Bitcoin Core" or "Bitcoin Segwit"

He is one of the earliest bitcoin owners and one of the earliest investors in bitcoin related startups. You may not like his opinion on how bitcoin should scale, but don't make up lies. 
@_date: 2018-01-21 04:58:35
WTF?! I love big blocks now
@_date: 2018-01-29 06:42:05
Bitcoin cash forked to larger block size. Bitcoin segwit forked to a new protocol. Both share the genesis block and blockchain history until the forks. Bitcoin (1mb, non segwit) does not exist anymore as far as I know. 
@_date: 2018-01-02 21:18:00
I suspect there isn't. Coinbase announced months ahead of time that they would be adding BCH to their exchange. When coinbase added API support for BCH it was a dead giveaway that they would be adding soon and that is when price ran up. 
 There are groups of people who intentionally spread misinformation about coinbase because they don't like Bitcoin cash. It is the whole repeat a lie often enough and people will begin to believe it type deal. This is where the whole inside trade thing originated from and lots of people fell for it.

Quit trying to scare people into selling their bitcoins. Quit the FUD OP! 
@_date: 2018-01-01 05:50:59
So bitcoin cash (please don't call it bcash BTW) should be valued at around $400? I am going to assume that will also count as income for 2017, correct? 
@_date: 2018-01-21 04:59:43
Zoom out ;)
@_date: 2018-01-29 06:57:11
A fork will make any previous version incompatible by definition. If bitcoin cash is incompatible with the previous version of bitcoin then so would bitcoin segwit since they both forked. 
Calling bitcoin cash "incompatible" is a banckhanded way of presenting bitcoin segwit as the only true version of bitcoin, when in fact, bitcoin segwit has more differences to the original version of bitcoin than bitcoin cash. Satoshi did create bitcoin with larger blocks sizes than the current 1Mb limit and segwit wasn't even a thing back then. 
By your definition they are both "new incompatible chain" and bitcoin cash more closely resembles the original version. Sorry, I don't think your explanation is correct.

Your long term rate rate depends on what you income level is. 15% is what most people will pay. If you are one of the fortunate ones that made more than $418,400, then you will pay 20%. Conversely, if you made less than $37,950, then you will pay nothing. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 17:06:12
What don't you understand? I can try to clarify. I understand it can be a little confusing if you are new and not familiar with the blocksize debate that has been going over the past few years. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:49:30
One thing is for sure. This sort of crash has never happened in bitcoin's history. Not even once. Definitely not after a huge bull run has taken place. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 17:14:58
It is a good question if EDA was part of Satoshi's vision. Certainly we can speculate whether Satoshi would have liked to improve the difficulty adjustment mechanism, but he/she has been gone for years. 
It is also a good question if features from bitcoin core, such as segwit, would also fall in line with Satoshi's vision. Bitcoin cash supporters don't seem to think segwit follows the Satoshi vision. Bitcoin Cash supporters prefer to keep transaction on chain and tend to oppose off chain scaling solutions like segwit. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:24:13
Absolutely not. You should check it out if you haven't already. Main thing is to just be reasonable and discuss bitcoin in a mature manner. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:15:32
Bitcoin cash.

I'm not aware of any "death spiral" being praised on and I am there frequently. Are you talking about  the current transaction backlog and how it takes hours, sometimes days to have transactions go through unless you pay high fees? That was something big blockers have been warning about for years, but the core development team chose to ignore in favor of side payment channels. If that is the "death spiral" you are talking about then that is on the core development team not choosing to raise the limit. And calling someone a shill because they have a differing opinion? You are better than that. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:19:29
I find talking about bitcoin tends to be more productive in Less name calling over there too. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 17:01:05
Correct me if my math is wrong, but isn't a 10% increase in Segwit use only equate to a .03Mb increase of blocksize utilization?
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:48:25
I wish the two bitcoin communities could just get along :(
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:44:05
Bad timing. Welcome to crypto!
@_date: 2017-12-05 16:19:44
To be fair, the creation Bitcoin Cash has been a black swan of sorts. It has huge demand and pretty much had instantaneous approval of by a large portion of the bitcoin community, which is probably why so many exchanges have implemented it. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 16:54:23
I think the only pressure they had was market demand and staying competitive. A few years back the "major" exchanges only had bitcoin for the most part. Now, exchanges are seeing how much money the left on the table by not adding other coins that they could be collecting trading fees on. I agree that with you that Litecoin probably should have been added to the main exchanges a long time ago. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 16:09:55
Community consensus could not be reached on how to scale bitcoin to the level of users to fit the global demand. At the center of the debate was block size, specifically the 1Mb limit. After consensus could not be reached, Bitcoin Cash was created that raised the limit. The blocksize limit was raised before Bitcoin Core could implement their form of scaling called "segwit". Supporters of Bitcoin core call Bitcoin cash "BCash" as a way to make it seem like it is not "bitcoin" since they do not agree with how Bitcoin Cash scaled. 
TLDR: Condescending name calling.
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:30:15
Thanks for explaining. I think lots of people against bitcoin cash would have let that false fact go uncorrected. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 17:15:24
This is where it gets tricky, but I would think that what ever version of bitcoin you sell first (bitcoin core/bitcoin cash) would be the one that would have the original cost basis of what you paid when you bought bitcoins. The version of bitcoin you sell second would essentially have 0 cost basis since it is a fork. One interpretation at least. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 17:25:06
It would be interesting to see what happens once coinbase adds bitcoin cash. It could sell off just as much as it could skyrocket. It will be fun to see what the market decides. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 17:39:41
Bitcoin has been on-chain since its inception. If that is "miner-controlled" then proposed alternatives do not seem like bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:11:09
Implying that BCH won't. Get your FUD out of here. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 17:22:45
It is easy to dismiss people who you disagree with by calling them "shills", but the fact remains there is a huge community (merchants, exchanges, users) that are behind bitcoin cash. Rather than calling people shills, it is better to debate the fundamentals behind Bitcoin Cash so that we can educate newcomers. Once they become more familiar, they can make decisions on their own. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:56:34
Good post. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 16:59:15
That is because many of the Bitcoin Cash supporters believe it is the true version of bitcoin. It is important to realize that Bitcoin Cash is pretty much  just a blocksize limit increase. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 16:41:33
You would hold an equal amount. Go to bitinfocharts under the Bitcoin Cash section to verify your amounts. You can sell your Bitcoin Cash on exchanges like Bitstamp, Bitfinex, Kraken, Poloniex and lots of others exchanges not listed. The only major exchange that does not have it enabled is Coinbase, but they should have that up and running sometime in early 2018. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 15:24:21
You can have the best engineers in the world, but until they solve the scaling issues we are currently facing people will seek out the version of bitcoin that allows easy transactions. Right now that is bitcoin cash. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 17:20:50
I know :(
@_date: 2017-12-29 15:06:10
Bitcoin cash developers also took out or fixed alot of problems left over from bitcoin core developers. Why is that not discussed here?
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:55:55
Calling bitcoin cash "Bcash" is the reason why people seek out other bitcoin subreddits to form an accurate opinion. Calling it "Bcash" only adds more legitimacy to subs like @_date: 2017-12-10 16:50:12
I like the conversations this sub has, but I hate how everyone worships satan. See what I did there?
@_date: 2017-12-31 00:58:37
Why would bitcoin cash be taxed any differently? If you hold more than a year it counts as long terms capital gains. If you hold less than a year it counts as short term capital gains.

OMG quit the smear campaign. He is not breaking any rules and this sub is on a witch hunt because he supports big blocks. This sub has been unbelievably toxic lately.

I think most people know what the sites are legit and what are fake. The only ones who don't are the noobs who haven't done their research and get their info from one source.
