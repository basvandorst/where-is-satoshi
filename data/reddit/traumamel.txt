Trying to predict the market by comparing today to ONE instance that happened ONCE a few years ago makes zero sense. This is not the same market as 2013. A lot more exchanges, mainstream news, and new people waiting to enter the market. 2013 was a totally different game. I don't know why people insist on calling this a bubble burst. If it went to 50% of what it was a few months ago I would be more convinced. It hasn't even retraced to the price just a few months ago. It refuses to stay below $10,000. It's jan., the worst month for cyrpto on top of everything else. Seriously, stop trying to sound smart and scare the newbies. Just because you've been invested longer doesn't make you wiser.

Yeap, this is a pretty well known fact by professional investors. The problem is it won't drop, and it won't rise. The longer it stays in this stagnant trend the less appealing a drop to 8000$ will be. Everyone remembers bitcoin was 17,000$ 2 months ago. However, 6 months from now people will only remember, hey, it was $10,000 the last few months, 8000$ isn't that big of a deal. I don't think that will happen, but bitcoin is playing by its own rules right now, and no one knows what they are. Not even the professionals.

Gotcha.

Yeap, it's up for the day, but been going down a little for last hour, in sync with bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:17:30
Pretty much sums up the last 24 hours
@_date: 2017-12-25 00:27:32
The only good thing about this extended drop is I haven't had to see "to the moon" on every other post. I don't know who made that phrase up, but it makes me literally want to shoot them to the moon. Or gouge my eyes out.

Didn't a lot of people end up losing everything when mt.gox went under? Did they recover any of their losses?
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:05:25
Lol, your literally a sheep following the flock if you just moved most your portfolio into ripple today. Should have done it months ago to really make bank. Yesterday BCH was on fire, and look at it today? That can easily be ripple tomorrow. Ripple is just being speculated to be on coinbase, which is why it's going up. It will crash if it doesn't get put on coinbase, or if the next altcoin becomes the next hot thing. It's madness. In the end bitcoin will still be standing, with all its high costs and all. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 15:40:47
Yeah, that makes sense. I don't know much about TA, I came to bitcoin because of the tech. I was tempted to sell too because of the huge volatility, but honestly I think this is just a good shakeout. It will continue up eventually. You have to shake out the weak hands at some point, it's just taking a little longer, So many indecisive people, especially since the end of the year is here. But I don't want to be one of those indecisive people, so I will hold. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 15:17:03
Well, it depends on the person. I honestly think throwing money at people does nothing. We're missing the bigger pucture. I came from poverty, and the fear of being poor again motivates me way more then anything. Helplessness propels me. I see rich kids or even people who just grew up "well off" middle class with much less drive then I do. In fact, I wish I could relax more, but it will never happen. Just look at immigrants to the usa. They come here with literally nothing, but end up creating awesome lives, usually much better lives then the people born here. The problem is emotional and mental, not a physical money problem. People Throwing money at "poor" people will never fix this problem. Building community, getting better mental health services, focusing on working on patterns of behavior people have been stuck.in for generations....that will help people. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 01:51:18
Well, their similar codes, but usually with updated corrections for issues they may have. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 01:22:28
So I went back and read article, and it says coinbase confirmed they will add "support" for bitcoin cash in 2018. So I'm guessing that means people who already have bitcoin cash in their coinbase from the forks will get support, but no mention if new customers can buy in. It would make sense that they would, since the supports there already but who knows. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 14:57:46
People keep saying this, but the dang thing won't go under $13,800. For a week it has resisted that point. I honestly wish it would go one way or the other. The suspension is killing me.
@_date: 2017-12-24 17:50:54
Don't underestimate the amount of last minute Christmas shoppers. I used to work at WalMart. The only day we closed was Christmas. We closed on Christmas Eve at 6pm and literally there would be hundreds of people trying to get in at 5:59pm to get last minute gifts. The store got pretty tore up on Christmas Eve. Then again, your talking about the people of Walmart...but...the general public isn't too far off from that. Not only that, but people put flights and gifts on credit cards, and when they see their bills they probably wish they had some cash to get them down. I don't know if this is causing any drop in bitcoin, but damn, people really do procrastinate...a huge amount do. Its like a rush, they live off the stress and adrenaline of waiting till the last dang moment. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:59:06
Sure that's what you meant ���� I know how to research. It doesn't change economics, money cycles, greed, and human nature. Look how fast Ripple is going down already? It always comes down to profit amd speculation with these cyrptos, no matter how good the technology is. The only cyrptocurrency that will ever have "real use" is one not corrupted by greed, and I don't see that happening anytime soon. Stellar Lumens is the only one so far I've seen good enough without greed, but it will come too.

I agree. They will both continue to rise, I have ETH as well.
@_date: 2017-12-24 03:33:01
Ahh crap, so that means my email is being connected to my coinbase? I guess that makes sense since we sign in with it. I will probably change my email, because my old rusty yahoo email has been compromised before and I don't want to risk it. Thanks for the heads up 
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:39:43
So true. I wanted to buy bitcoin in 2012, but it looked too hard to buy at the time, as I was used to just going in a store to buy gold or silver for investments.... and being handed it right there. Wallets, exchanges, etc were foreign to me. But in truth, I would have sold it when it went up just a little. I know myself �� so not too upset. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:09:21
Because his granny told him. And if anyone knows bitcoin it's gram grams.

That necklace should come with a set of balls. Cuz that's what you need to survive these constant turmoil in bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:54:26
I think that's a great plan, that's what I've been doing. Loading up on BTC, It's definently in an upwards trend even without BCH in the mix.

Tred carefully my friend. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 17:45:06
You seem to have a lot of ideologies, but no real life experience. Have you gone and lived with people in poverty? Seen what motivates them? Or do you think you know what's best, because...you know better? Capitalism does work, we have one of the best economies in the world, as does Chile which is also a capitalist country. Our unemployment rate is at all time lows. If you consider "begging" an appropriate job, we'll then I can't help you with common sense. Common sense and reality will always trump ideology. I hate to admit it, but I was awarded with a full  $40000 scholarship to college just because i was a minority. Guess what I did with it? Regretfully I failed out of every class. I had no idea how to handle college. I had no tools, just free money. Eventually I got my crap together, paid for my own college, and did well because I had to work for it. I know you will say "that's your experience only", but real life will always mean more then ideology. Again,I'm sure throwing money at people makes you feel better, more powerful, more incontrol... but it does nothing to truly deal with the true causes of poverty. I would respect someone more who tried to get to the root of the problem. The true deep issues that cause poverty, instead of throwing money at the problem. Like they say, give a man a fish feed him for a day, teach him to fish and feed him for a lifetime. But good luck with what your doing. My hope is one day someone will actually care enough to get into the deep issues, and not just the superficial issues. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:39:34
Lol, how's Ripple going? What happened to your comment about "ripple not going under a dollar"?. Pretty sure it's way under a buck now. This is what I keep telling people. All these cyrptos are the same. The technology will never matter. Their all just greedily run coins run on speculation. If you think otherwise because Google told you to, then your doomed. You have to think.on your own and realize it's all just a money gamble game. That's it. Nothing more. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:31:26
If Trump says "i hate bitcoin, and no one should own it" i guarantee there would be a stampede to buy it. 19k in no time. Come on Trump my old friend...just say it. Pretty please.

Weird question. But does anyone know where the default picture on your coinbase account comes from? Mine has a picture of a baby with crazy hair, which is the same pic I have on my WordPress account. My WordPress account password got compromised so now im.worried if their connected. Anyone know? 
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:45:49
Makes sense. Especially since pretty much all the cyrptos are falling right now. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 00:37:44
Agree. I think it has a high chance of being next on coinbase, but the only confirmed new coin is bitcoin cash I believe. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 14:55:48
 It's crazy, because last time it dipped hard (literally last week, lol) a lot of the technicial analysis people kept saying it would drop to around $10k because it lost support, but it never went under $13,800. The same thing is happening today. I keep seeing calls for $10k, but it seems it won't go lower then $13,900. It's like a weird psychological barrier around $13,900. I guess the point is, this is a whole new ball game...and i dont think anyone knows how it's really gonna play out. It makes for an entertaining, yet terrifying ride. Strap in friends.

Lol, yeah, I know exactly what xrp is. Everyone keeps repeating the same thing over and over, Asian narkets. I get it. It's the same Asian market that ran to bitcoin, and bitcoin cash. Ripple will do fine, but people touting it's glory just because it's going up now is crazy. It's speculation. Ripple may go higher, or lower, who knows. But it's not going to overtake bitcoin. It's just not. Just like everyone thought ETH might, but it didnt. People need to calm down and take a deep breath, and get off the sheep train. Think for yourself. Not just what you read off "google".

@_date: 2017-12-28 21:45:11
What bank? That's weird. I haven't heard of people having trouble on coinbase too often. Coin mama is pretty easy to use. You pay a little more, but you just pop in your credit card info and you can buy right away and send to a wallet. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:29:57
Honestly, do you think you would have held it this long throughout all the big drops and "collapses" and Mt.Gox going under. I mean, I know I would have sold after making just a small amount, because back then it was super risky. At 100$ people were sure the "bubble would pop". I would have sold, I know it...to avoid losing my gains. Most people who made big bucks were people who forgot they had it, or a few who truly believed in the tech die hard.

@_date: 2017-12-13 01:39:22
If a coin forks, like bitcoin forked into bitcoin cash, then everyone who has bitcoin at the time of fork gets equal amount of the new coin...i.e. bitcoin cash. So if you had 1 BTC at fork, you will get 1 bitcoin cash
 
@_date: 2017-12-24 03:20:23
I was wondering the same thing.
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:07:14
I'm thinking around mid 11,000 is next support. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:20:03
Lol, yeah, I think everyone knows that. That's the basic superficial layer of ripple everyone knows. It's rise is due to speculation, just like every other altcoin. Ripple isnt is use yet, so its all pure speculation. It's also cycle waves, and a lot deeper then "Japan and korea", but I hope it all works out for you. What goes up must come down. I have Ripple myself, but I know this is just a wave that will crash down just like the others. There's better than coins out there that could easily take its place. Steals lumems, etc. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 16:12:40
Luck? Wow. No luck in my case. In fact, I had the opposite of luck. I have 5 siblings. We all grew up in the same low income house, half are successful, half arent. So your saying the half that were successful just had luck? Please. When will people learn you cannot simply things and box them into neat little beliefs and "conquer" them. It very much does come down to the individual person too. Their emotional and mental makeup.. If poverty begets poverty, why doesn't welfare work to get people working? Or people who beg for money on the street? A lot of them make more money begging then working. Does that money suddenly change them into functioning working adults? Nope. Their still out there begging, usually the same people day in and day out. No matter how much monet they get. Why? Mental and emotional issues, not money. They have money...handed to them. People pick up things in their environment growing up. If they feel helpless, money isn't gonna change that feeling. Take it from me. I still feel helpless a lot. We're focusing on the wrong thing as always. Short sighted. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:21:21
Thanks for that tip. I was planning to buy at 10,000, but will do so around 10, 500 just to be safe. If it ever gets that low. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:27:35
Do you think 11000 is the bottom or will it get lower? I think we just hit the bottom...
@_date: 2017-12-28 15:29:23
Yeah, that's what people tell me. I never saw it hit below 11k on coinbase, and even then it was so quick I couldn't jump in until $12,500k because it went up quick. When technical analysis people say "next support is at 10k", it makes me think they mean it will stay at 10k for a while...because that's where "support" is. But it hasn't, only quick drops. Maybe I'm understanding "support" incorrectly?
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:34:18
Interesting perspective. Do you tend to sell at highs and buy back in on lows, or do you just hold ( yes. I spell it correctly lol)
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:58:43
What do you think volatility is? People have to sell off large amounts to get huge swings. There have been MANY reasons people have sold off Bitcoin in the past. However, it always ends up rising from the dust. In the end, the most important thing is people's mental health. Can they handle these types of drops. This is similar to the dot.com bubble. People said the Internet would die off after the dot.com bubble popped, but it's still here and bigger then ever. Bitcoin is paving a way, and new paths are never ever straight and easy. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:52:52
I totally understand this. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:48:37
I truly feel bad for the new people who are having a hard time dealing with this volitality. I remember when Bitcoin would go from 8$ back to 1$ and then back up to 3$ rinse and repeat. Volitality has ALWAYS been a part of Bitcoin. If your in this for the short term, sure, sell your coins for whatever profit you have left. However, if you really truly want to hodl long term, you have to find a way to accept the insane volitality in cyrptos. You have to be honest with yourself and decide if you can handle the extreme swings without compromising your quality of life. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 03:42:52
Yeah, I know that tactic. But it's usually used to put fake sell walls to keep price low. I don't see the purpose of putting up fake buy walls...unless I'm missing a point.
@_date: 2018-02-04 00:44:23
It's always a possibilty. However, the larger possibility is it will go back up to that price. It's all a game of possibilities. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 03:29:28
Damn, I just looked. How can it go down anymore with such a big buy wall and tiny sell wall? But it somehow keeps dropping?
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:25:12
I'm not sure how long you've been in Cyrpto, but I can guarantee you people freaked out. Why do you think it went down 90% ? Because people saw it dropping and got scared and sold. Every single drop was caused by people's emotions and them getting fearful and selling. That's when the logical people swooped in and bought. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 03:25:31
I agree with this. The sentiment on here seems to be everyone is waiting to get back in. It will be a matter of when will the cyrpto place finally stabalize.
@_date: 2018-02-04 00:42:27
You really think those people came to the game for a few months only to leave forever? They will be back. 
@_date: 2018-02-10 01:58:10
Those fan boys are the ones bringing the price up and making me money. Leave em' alone. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 03:43:28
Yeah, yeah. I know that. But why put a fake buy wall? 
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:17:53
People actually did care. Why do you think you see all the meme's about people selling their bitcoin for $20 or so and feeling bad about it now. They sold because they were afraid they would lose their profits if it went down. Even back then people were in personal battles with themselves about whether they should sell at 15$ or wait for $20 and risk the chance it could go back down to 10$. They were all thinking short term, when little did they know long term it would go higher. Money is money. No one wants to lose it.  People's psychological reactions are the same no matter what price Bitcoin is. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:33:25
I'm not sure where your going with this. Compared to dot.com bubble the amount of money "gone" so far is miniscule. It might seem like a lot to you, but in the grand scheme of things in the business world it's barely a notch. The stock market can lose that amount in seconds. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:27:49
Just 1%? You big baller.
