So I found another address that apparently contains the bitcoins. It was created automatically using bitcointip. Does that mean that I have 2 different "wallets" now? How can I transfer the funds between those accounts/wallets?

Thanks again! I think I finally figured it out although it's still confusing. Apparently I had .49 cents but it became .39 after I transferred it. Oh well

Thanks for the reply. Honestly, I'm not sure. 
This is my bitcoin address 1NnFRzBr8KLrBik8S12uDBd3TTB33ivDfn.
Is that the public key?
I am not interested in donations so sorry if it looks that way, I would just like some help :)

I really appreciate you taking the time to help me out CaptainPatent. I feel like such an idiot. I think I'm doing the right thing but nothing is happening. After I send the message, is it supposed to work right away? I can see that the message has been sent but Idk if it was done properly, or if I used the correct information.

After this comment, I created the account and have been trying to claim those bitcoins but I can't seem to find a private key anywhere

Thanks Kyle! I'm actually not sure. I will pass your information on to him and he will probably give you all the details. I'm guessing Paypal but I have no idea.
