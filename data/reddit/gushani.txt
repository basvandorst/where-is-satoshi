@_date: 2019-07-14 15:10:05
You didn’t had enough money in your bank for that purchase of btc
@_date: 2019-07-14 15:03:06
Now the Whales want to cause a panic and take the btc from the people who are selling in panic so after they took all those btc from a chickens investors then the price will go ATH

You have a brain but your dad not. You should be rich by now if your dad bought btc when you told him. Now, depending how much btc your dad bought, i am sure he did not bought more than 5btc as now is to expensive for ordinary people to buy btc.. it will take few years to get rich...

I paid the 001btc fee but the fee from moved wallet is still unconfirmed and network propagation is 0%. Network very slow.
It is passed 24 hours now. I moved btc from paper wallet to blockchain
@_date: 2016-06-01 11:28:06
I setup the blockchain to "generous" fee, that was the maximum on the fee setup.
So, what happens now?
@_date: 2016-06-01 11:46:27
Does it can be returned to original btc papar wallet?!

My parents already done the verification. They need just to cash their btc’s
@_date: 2019-08-17 08:23:50
Never leave your funds on the exchange!
Make paper wallet or buy ledger nano s wallet to keep your btc safe.
@_date: 2019-06-05 01:18:00

Forgot to say what year?! Maybe in next 10 years
@_date: 2019-06-16 09:45:30
What about this saying no tax if you holding crypto over 1 year?!
@_date: 2019-06-15 19:31:43
Just send  the cash  to your uk bank acc
@_date: 2019-06-16 09:49:29
If you exchange your btc to fiat and send them to your bank, tax on gain.,,
@_date: 2019-06-16 22:04:58
How i can prove that i had those btc over 1 year if my new btc address is let’s say 1 month old..?!
@_date: 2019-06-06 18:07:42
What a stupid question...
A bit (short for binary digit) is the smallest unit of data in a computer. A bit has a single binary value, either 0 or 1. ... Half a byte (four bits) is called a nibble. In some systems, the term octet is used for an eight-bit unit instead of byte.
@_date: 2019-06-16 22:25:13
That’s is exactly what I thought
@_date: 2019-06-08 19:05:19

@_date: 2019-06-08 19:08:41
Is it here you look for volume 
@_date: 2019-06-12 21:04:07
Even if btc rise to 80k it will get back 
90+% as it always did...
@_date: 2019-06-15 10:55:52
What app?

Where is the justice?! Flushed in the toilet...
@_date: 2019-06-17 07:32:52
I changed several paper wallets and the last address is ledger nano address about 8 months old
@_date: 2019-06-10 22:43:47
Nope, btc are there in your account but you don’t have enough for a whole bitcoin, you have a satoshi... same as you don’t have whole 1e  but you have about 5 cents...
@_date: 2019-06-17 09:09:22
All cryptos
@_date: 2019-06-15 19:33:59
Simply “ new digital money” without bank getting rich by using your money
@_date: 2019-06-15 19:32:44
Same here ����
@_date: 2019-06-10 18:27:29
Is it private or public address?
If is public address then you can put the whole address. No one will scum you to take your public address to send you crypto...
@_date: 2019-06-05 17:39:25
..and he is “bankrupted” too

How can tax officer know for sure if that address is mine or I bought it from someone and that someone sent it to my new btc address that is less than 1 year old..?
@_date: 2019-06-15 20:51:01
If you are familiar with crypto wallets then you can buy example bitcoins and send them to your wallet then open account on the btc exchange as is kraken or Bitstamp. Exchange your btc into euros or dollars  and send them into your bank acc in uk.
You can buy btc at the same btc exchange as is kraken or Bitstamp by transfering the money into your btc exchange acc or by buying with credit card, daily limit 1.500e if you are using credit card
@_date: 2019-06-06 18:48:09
Yup that is the way (to bankruptcy)

What if i still have old paper wallet that is over 1 year old before i sent btc to new ledger wallet that is less than 1 year old?
@_date: 2019-04-17 22:27:27
There is fee for transactions
@_date: 2019-06-10 18:31:51

@_date: 2019-04-25 19:03:28
Once you want to use it then you have to use all the coins on it as your prv key will be used to use the coins so it’s not safe to keep any coins on it anymore. You have to create new paper wallet and transfer the coins you want to keep

I sent deposit just 2 days before Mt.Gox website get closed without warning and I never received that deposit into my Mt.Gox account. I have the receipt from my bank etc. The Mt.Gox Bankruptcy trustee have accepted the BTC amount as there was BTC showing in to my Mt. Gox account account but the trustee had rejected the amount of Euros/deposit I sent to the Mt.Gox Polish Bank. Nobuaki Kobayashi said that amount is not exist into my Mt.Gox account!? Have the Mt.Gox Bankruptcy trustee Nobuaki Kobayashi checked the Mt.Gox Polish Bank account?? What did he do for the past few years??? The Mt.Gox Polish Account I sent deposit that never arrived is: MTGOX POLAND INC. SP. Z.O.O IBAN:PL59109023980000000117595694. BIC:WBKPPLPP BANK NAME: BANK ZACHODNI WBK SA BANK ADDRESS: RYNEK 9/11 COUNTRY: POLAND If the Mt.Gox Bankruptcy Trustee Nobuaki Kobayashi missed this Mt.Gox Polish Bank that means that the Criminial MARK KARPELES had managed to get away with those cash deposited into that MT.Gox Polish Bank! I have the bank receipt, I sent to Nobuaki Kobayashi the documents by register post, hope he will get them and understand that there are more people like me! Please if you have same problem do not just seat, do something and try to send the proof you sent the money deposit to the Mt. Gox Polish Band that never arrived to your Mt.Gox Account!
