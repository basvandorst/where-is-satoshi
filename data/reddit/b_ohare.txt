Yup. Makes perfect sense.

I've never built a computer before (although I've replaced drives before so I'm not completely inept). I'm considering building a rig and did some initial searches on the web to find instructions. A few questions if you please:
1. Could someone recommend what they consider the best video to watch on how to build something like this? I'd like to watch someone build the complete machine.
2. This appears to not include certain components (e.g., case, fan, keyboard). Why is that? (I assume you don't include the keyboard because you just temporarily use one from another machine and then disconnect once it's running?)
3. There are times when I will want to use this for normal computer activities and, thus, would have to install Windows 7 on it and add a hard drive. As I'm going to do that, are there any extra considerations?
4. My preference would be to pay someone a little extra to put this together so that I'm not fumbling with it for 2 days. My concern is that I will get used parts (or not the right components) or that the parts will go bad and I won't be able to return them. What do you think is the proper markup to pay someone to build this for me, and what advice would you have to go about it?

Lost 7 Mhash after installing this. Going back to previous version.

Candidly, I didn't know about the pools or that there were other mining tools out there. That was not clear to me from the Wiki (at least at the time I read it - I haven't gone back to see if it's clearer now).
But this has been a very helpful thread in learning. Now, who will be writing the first Bitcoins for Dummies book?

So that's why mining for 24/7 for the last month has yielded... zilch &gt;.&gt;

This might be a silly question, but why remove the generate coins option from the GUI? Can you no longer use this to mine? How do you go about mining now?

I don't agree with that. Once the government can regulate it, it will be regulated under the banking cartel. When the government regulates bitcoin, it's over.

My 0.02 bitcoins, for what they are worth...
If this is not anonymous and is, in any way, linked to the government or government regulation, I'd say bitcoins is dead. We need a better exchange than government money specifically because of all the problems government creates with money.
There's no way I would do anything with bitcoins if the government is involved - there wouldn't be any benefit of using bitcoins over current fiat currencies. And that would be sad.
