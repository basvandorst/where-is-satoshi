Best non-tech explanation so far!
@_date: 2012-02-20 19:59:15
Upvote, cause this is one of my favorite quotes...
@_date: 2012-03-10 12:54:14
Pretty good. Only thing I would change is the concern about the US government shutting bitcoin down. It can't.
@_date: 2012-06-05 17:32:09
The trend its your friend until it ends...
@_date: 2012-04-21 07:51:05
Do you mean that this reasoning applies to US dollars only? Should be true for all currencies.

It's always time to buy bitcoins, if you're in it for the long run. 
But lines in a graph say absolutely nothing about the future.
@_date: 2012-01-08 21:34:03
Surprised the editor accepted such a biased article.
@_date: 2012-03-20 22:01:28
This is good news, enough with the excuses. 
@_date: 2012-02-22 20:30:05
Good point.
@_date: 2012-01-22 14:18:11
Pretty good article!

June 11, when Falkvinge started to write about bitcoin. It took a couple of days to sink in, but then I was so fascinated I couldn't think about anything else. Still can't. 
The more I get to know about bitcoin, the more convinced I get about its future success. There are so many use cases. One is enough to start the fire.
I buy bitcoins every month. My goal is to hoard 2100 bitcoins before they get too expensive, and then keep them for a couple of years. 
(2100 coins will never be less than 1/10,000th of the bitcoin economy.) 
On top of this, I also buy for spending. Not only a hoarding parasite...

So you're saying that YOU are not emotionally attached to bitcoin? You seem to be very attached, judging from your emotional but idiotic anti bitcoin posts. 
The opposite of love is not hatred, it's indifference. Having this in mind,please prove to us that you're not in love with bitcoin.

You have pretty much misunderstood the idea of Reddit and you have therefore earned my downvote.
@_date: 2012-04-09 09:05:41
Thank you for your feedback. However, I find your statement hard to believe when you waste your time even more by commenting again.
@_date: 2012-01-06 17:08:08
Don't forget, bitcoin is a global currency... 
@_date: 2012-05-04 12:59:06
And today: **[All time high!] (
@_date: 2012-04-07 19:22:31
So all redditors should go ahead an copy-paste the contents of links into threads now? Just in case it gets deleted? Please don't...
@_date: 2012-02-19 10:02:36
Interesting research idea. Funny too!
@_date: 2012-03-15 15:06:44
The obvious question: Why? 
If If I could do 100% safe arbitrage, I’d shut up about it and just do it for myself. Makes me suspicious...
@_date: 2012-05-03 09:43:04
You're right. 
However, the example you pick - total hosts - is not a very representative metric of the growth of the bitcoin economy. Online wallets and lightweight clients are getting more popular. 
(Also, I didn't imply or suggest any interpretation of the graph. Not explicitly, anyway...)

Actually IRC has a lot to do with bitcoin. From the [Wiki FAQ]( 
*Bitcoin finds peers primarily by connecting to an IRC server (channel  on irc.lfnet.org). If a connection to the IRC server cannot be established (like when connecting through TOR), an in-built node list will be used and the nodes will be queried for more node addresses.*
@_date: 2012-01-23 04:55:40
I'm suspicious. If I had what they claim to have,I would keep the mining profits instead of selling hashing power. 
@_date: 2011-11-15 07:51:22
The actual value is always what you can sell it for right now. 
@_date: 2011-11-15 17:15:21
Are you talking about intrinsic value? The intrinsic value of Bitcoin is - almost by definition - zero. In contrast, gold does have an intrinsic value. The price of goods with only intrinsic value is ruled by supply and demand too. There is no such thing as a 'real world value' detached from supply and demand.
@_date: 2011-12-16 09:44:20
Yeah. Expensive typo...
@_date: 2011-11-15 16:53:29
No. If bitcoin catches on for payments, many people will want to get their hands on some, for quick and cheap transactions. 
High demand for bitcoins while supply is still limited --&gt; price goes up. Even without speculators.
@_date: 2011-12-30 10:53:26
Thanks. And what are the practical implications of all this, in your view? 
"Open Transactions will simplify my life because they allow me to ..."  
@_date: 2011-12-31 10:34:05
Wow. Just wow. 
And thanks! This is the kind of answer I was looking for. I'll let it sink in now...

How can one be sure the manufacturer didn't copy the private key and cashes in unused coins after some time?
@_date: 2011-11-15 12:10:27
You are funny. "I think it is around 50 cent to 80 cent". 
You don't have to guess or dream about the value of a bitcoin, just look at the charts. Simple as that.
@_date: 2011-11-14 07:47:59
Guess they would have to mirror the last rate of one of the exchanges, or an average of several exchanges?
@_date: 2011-12-30 16:03:48
Thanks. 
But I'm sure OT will in the future enable plenty that even Joe Average can take advantage of, on some level. This is what I would like to know. **How will the lives of regular citizens be changed by OT?** (Once user-friendly services are built on top of OT)

Why is this ppa better than stretch?
@_date: 2011-11-30 19:59:10
Ok, thanks. He probably ran off with the coins then.
@_date: 2011-11-15 19:04:59
Good example! You cannot sell sand in the desert because supply is ridiculously high. But: the price of sand can get pretty high in a city with icy pavements, since demand is high and supply is low. 
Bitcoin supply increases steadily, but at a very predictable rate. If demand for the properties of bitcoin increases faster than the rate of supply, the bitcoin price will increase too! 
@_date: 2011-11-01 18:40:05
@_date: 2011-11-20 17:12:00
So how do these relate to the computing power of the bitcoin network?

You mean if you had *not* bought that pizza?
