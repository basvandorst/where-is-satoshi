Saving this

BITMAIN B3 ASIC miner has just been cracked and ported for NVIDIA GPU cards and apparently the 3 GTX1050 cards beat 1 BITMAIN B3 ASIC in performance.
The crack/port of the miner was done by the  team. It appears that the miner used inside of the ASIC can do 300 H/s on a single GTX 1050 card. So, 3 x GTX 1050 that currently cost ~500$ will produce 900 H/s and use only 210 W. Compared to the BITMAIN B3 ASIC 760 H/s for 360 W for ~3500$ (retail price at the moment of writing).
The miner is currently only usable under Linux and the setup can be done easily via the MinerOS A complete guide on how to setup the miner and MinerOS can be found on the UU Pool site.
We have also provided an alternative download location in case the miner gets removed. BTM Miner NVIDIA
This development shines light on an interesting angle of ASICs. When people think of ASICs and their power, most assume that their mining advantage comes from the specifically designed ASIC chips they use. Apparently the miner software they use for the B3 has played a more important role compared to the chips. it certainly is interesting if such a crack/port of their miners is possible for the EQUIHASH and ETHASH ASICS. That would be one way GPU mining remains profitable.
One can say that the GPUs just stroked back at BITMAIN and their conquest to make an ASIC for every coin that exists. We will have to wait and see if BITMAIN will “fork” their ASICs and make them “GPU resistant”

So right back to the wall street insider scam model of the rich get the first sale and then  they pawn it off at a higher price to the poorer investors who cant afford to invest 100 eth.
This is why you should only get involved in mining coins which cant be witheld from people at early stages  no matter their level of wealth.
Screw EGRETIA  . Its a garbage funding scam coin in my opinion.

Festivals became a rackett preying on  young filmakers.  Application fees then appearance fees the  bad sharing of attendance revenue with filmmakers.
The original purpose was to be seen by big hollywood producers.
That need isnt there now.  You'll be better off being seen by millions on youtube.
You become a filmaker the day you stop seeking recognition from other filmmakers and start thinking you can  say something better than they can.

I didnt realize such a thing was possible.
@_date: 2018-05-25 08:51:07
You are partially correct but it is a balance.
The marginal miner will always mine regarddless of todays bitcoin price becuase they expect the price to be higher in the future. Not every miner needs to make a profit today. Thus the power costs do determine the price of bitcoin for the last marginal operating miner ..not the current cost of bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-05-01 09:56:39
First of all thats chump changein the world financial msrkets.
Also Thats only for the mining period.
Once mining is finished then only a single small purchase sets  the price
@_date: 2018-05-01 08:34:18
It will drop to 20k after a rise to 50k.   Then it will drop to 50k after a rise to 150k.
Thats sort of the historic pattern
This will continue until all the world is invested somewhat in bitcoin as a normal part of a balanced portfolio. At that point the price may be 300k to 20,000,000 . Hardto know.

Personally I beleive the value will skkyrocket when the only way to get one is to convince another person to sell you theirs.
I think if the lifecycle of mining had been only twop or three years bitcoin would already be over 1,000,000 per coin.
Additionally a version of Moores energy law in asics has kept the price of bitcoin artificially low becuase new asics have been so remarkably energy efficient. If they hadnt mining  costs woukd have been much higher and the price would be higher.
Ask yourself what has has risen in value more. The price of a dead artists paintings or those of a painter still painting? When supply is finite value rises.
When mining dies Bitcoin skyrockets.

Thats exactly what I mean.  My advice is meant for new comers tryi g to make magerial that can help them build a reputation or make money so they can get future funding or fund their own projects.
If you dont already have a reputation good enough to get funding or cant fund yourself then you need to do the same.
Usually what that means is pick simple to shoot material and do most of the work yourself so you arent "exploiting " others . Btw if you use newcomers who get needed credit and experience then you arnet "exploiting" them either.

Its true.
All the breakout directoes that are courte dby hollywood are did things without hollywood and bette rthan hollywood. They didnt sit around nad try to get hollywood to recognize them.
And if you aregoing to amke a movie dont make a short film.  No one can sell those.
Make a full length film. Chose a genre that is not expensive. Do a Roger Corman. Film making with friends can be veryinexpensive now. No film cost. Cheap lighting. Shot and run is easy so no location costs. No editing equopment costs. All you need are good wireless microphones which are cheap too.

Yeah.   In my old gpu mining days i dont thi k that was such a thing though although i remember ther ewas a difficjlty level.
However arent there sha256 that have lower difficulty so older miners can still work? Large Numbers of miners can overcome individual low power and still find  locks right?  There shoukd be at least one low difficulty pool for the older miner machines.

Listen to what the patent examiner says in the movie "The Patent Scam" on netflix.
Examiners have an average of 4 hours for each patent and they assume the patent is valid unless they can find previous patents in the record for the same thing.
Thus things that were  so obvious that they were never patented like throwing a stick for a dog to chase get patented and not refused.
The real solution would be make it trivial to get  a patent invalidated. All one should have to do with no filing fee is submit proof the idea existed before such as a time stamped public discussion on reddit or magazine article or publishedbook etc. So "see spot fetch stick" published in 1962  would be an invalidating submission on the dog stick patent (which actually exists)

It actually cant go to zero even  theoretically. Its statistically impossible asthere will always be buyers.
So lets stop that nonsense.
And it has tremendous fundemental value.
It has all the value of paper money and a bank account for free. Those include ability to time separate earnings from expendentures,  ability to store and account for transactions safely, ability to prove and verify worth,  protection from theft, protection from the elements, ability to cross borders unimpeded,  nearly instantaneous, weightless and bulkless (not insignificant since gold and even stacks of cash are extremely cumbersome)
You are just repeating mantras that are completely false and it shows you have no understanding of what money is and why bank accounts exist.

So once again a lack of clarity which means in actuallity all such activity will go off shore to other countries and americans will be left out of the future. Intial offering will remain closed to ip addresses from america just to avoid the hassles.
I am glad i got in early on crypto
One of the best things about early crypto is you did NOT have to be an accredited investor (in other words already rich) to buy in beforethe retail sale to schmucks. Securities laws dont protect retial investors. They ensure retail investors get screwed while rich insiders get securities at presale prices and make exreaordinary profits.
And that is the way wall street likes it.

Bitcoin is not a security or a currency.
Despite multple bureacracies seeking to take control of it and tax it, it does not fit the intended definition of any prior regulatory law passed by congress and allsuch attempts at control are overeach.
And from past statements by the republican leadership they want it to remain unregulated for the time being so as not to hinderits development.
Theonly thing bitcoin is for sure is a computer networking communications protocol.

Its  not.
Its not money.
Its not a security.
Its not currency.
Its a computer communications and data storage protocol.
This is important for legal and regulatory reasons that are coming apparent and will be more so in the future. It is more importantly the truth.
We are at a time where the convenience of explaining things as "coins" is very detrimental to the cause.
Its time to stop. There are no "coins".
And any quasi government agency calling crypto either a currency or money or a security is NOT doing it to support crypto. Just the opposite.

Satochi was a marketing genius. This is greatly underestimatwd.
By naming his protocol system a "coin" and coming out with a graphic of a gold coin it made the value of the protocol system recognizable to those who had no concept what it was.
It probably would never have taken hold if he hadnt done those two things.

This is legal FUD which we should fight, not support with mere speculation.
Crypto are none of the above and since congress has made no laws regarding the new invention known as Bitcoin or cryptos then no laws exist.
The good news is the republican congress is loathe to regulate this area  just as other congresses wanted to not regulate and destroy the internet In its beginnings..
The problem of government agencies seeking to expand their reach and control beyond their mandate is not new and holds little legal merit.
It is the agencies that need to be controlled and not crypto.
Republicans have already slapped the IRS for what the congress viewed as overesch seeking coinbase customer info.
And remember old laws cant be expanded to things they dont cover without corrective expanded or new legislation by congress. For example old laws specifically covering horses did not apply to cars evne though they shared some similarities.. New laws had to be created.
And expo facto laws (laws made after the fact to cover things thst already happened) are unconstitutional in the usa.
There is no doubt regulatory agencies will try but the correct stance for any bitcoin supporter or lobby group to take is that crypto is a new invention that is NOT the same as any previously regulated activity or product and that only new laws specifically passed by congress can regulate it and only in the future.
Please note also tue supreme court has ruled many times agaisnt vague laws including a recent case where the new justice Gorsuche held a law to be unconstitutionally vague so the law is on crypto's side there as well.
Its important that all crypto groups align in solidarity behind these legal principles. The spreading of legal hysteria and doom and gloom speculation is not helpful to ANY crypto including bitcoin.
Every person shouod contact their representatives and say that regulatroy authorities cannot be allowed to expand their reach and that only congress can make laws and that you want congress to keep their hands off cryptos and force the regulatory agencies to keep heir hands off cryptos while the new invention is developing just like they did with the internet.
