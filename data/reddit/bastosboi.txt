Lots of Filipinas working abroad in Hong Kong, Dubai, North America etc. and sending money back home via Western Union.
Great to see Bitcoin taking hold of the Philippines and making remittances instant and friction-less, diverting wealth away from Western Union and to the people.

Out of curiosity and to understand why anyone would actually have the "criminal energy" to manipulate the payment to yuo: What kind of business, if I may ask? No face-to-face interaction?

disagree. China is a shadow of its former self and not as influential in the crypto space as they used to be.
however, with all the trillions of debt they continue to rack up, the barrel their government is trying to contain will start leaking. people in and out of China are starting to realize the credit bubble and want out. 
depreciating CNY will convert into appreciating BTC.
see the increase in volume for CNY on localBitcoins.com. this is just the beginning, and only the tip of the iceberg

always great to see merchants starting to accept Bitcoin. next step is to also spend Bitcoin.
make it both a store of value AND a currency. put some on cold storage as your savings account for early retirement, and have some Bitcoin in your hot wallet on your phone for spending.

This 2X-part of the Segwit2X agreement is a classic display of the unknown unknowns. 
What seems so easy on the surface (change a "1" to a "2" in the code) uncovers a looooooong tail of subsequent efforts, which nobody really can think out completely in all the areas it touches.
Hour by hour the picture gets clearer, more and more implications and ripple effects rise to the surface.
The more information we have, the more I am convinced we should act **conservatively**, since now **there are $70bn at stake**, and much more potential upside will be destroyed if the crypto community messes this up. 
Honeybadger don't care and all, but messing this up will kill off the momentum we have gained in 2017. People are starting to grasp the potential and Bitcoin is slowly building a trusted track record. Messing this up will destroy that and set us back for years.
If this set-back then coincides with an **economic recession** (since we seem to be in an everything-bubble (stocks, housing, oldtimers ...) at the moment), this will seriously dampen development in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. 
I really appreciate Bitfinex for stepping out of the woods and issuing clear statements on how they want to approach the situation. 
Especially putting politics aside and looking at reality, e.g. putting **customers' interests** and **backwards compatibility** first.

Preparing to add full / strong replay-protection? 
That'd be the only sensible thing to do &amp; would make B2X an altcoin, also resulting in airdrop for BTC private key holders.

**KEY HIGHLIGHTS OF THE STUDY**
• The current number of unique active users of cryptocurrency wallets is estimated to be between 2.9 million and 5.8 million.
• The lines between the different cryptocurrency industry sectors are increasingly blurred: 31% of cryptocurrency companies
surveyed are operating across two cryptocurrency industry sectors or more, giving rise to an increasing number of universal
cryptocurrency companies.
• At least 1,876 people are working full-time in the cryptocurrency industry, and the actual total figure is likely well above two
thousand when large mining organisations and other organisations that did not provide headcount figures are added.
• Average security headcount and costs for payment companies and exchanges as a percentage of total headcount/operating
expenses are similar, but significantly higher for wallets.
• The exchanges sector has the highest number of operating entities and employs more people than any other industry sector
covered in this study; a significant geographical dispersion of exchanges is observed.
• 52% of small exchanges hold a formal government license compared to only 35% of large exchanges.
• On average, security headcount corresponds to 13% of total employees and 17% of budget is spent on security.
• Between 5.8 million and 11.5 million wallets are estimated to be currently ‘active’.
• The lines between wallets and exchanges are increasingly blurred: 52% of wallets surveyed provide an integrated currency
exchange feature, of which 80% offer a national-to-cryptocurrency exchange service. In contrast with exchanges, the majority
of wallets do not control access to user keys.
• While 79% of payment companies have existing relationships with banking institutions and payment networks, the difficulty
of obtaining and maintaining these relationships is cited as this sector's biggest challenge.
• On average, national-to-cryptocurrency payments constitute two-thirds of total payment company transaction volume,
whereas national-to-national currency transfers and cryptocurrency-to-cryptocurrency payments account for 27% and 6%,
• 70% of large miners rate their influence on protocol development as high or very high, compared to 51% of small miners.
• The cryptocurrency mining map shows that publicly known mining facilities are geographically dispersed, but a significant
concentration can be observed in certain Chinese provinces.

Core has evaluated the risks, identified it as a threat and decided to take up the fight.
Gotta appreciate that they take a clear stance.
Nothing would be worse than running into a desaster, losing customers' trust (i.e. Bitcoins) by doing nothing and waiting to see how things play out.

-	I am a party with significant funds
-	I know about the upcoming 2x hardfork
-	I expect ~45-50% of hash power to jump ship and follow the 2X chain
-	I believe that BTC Core will prevail
-	I am incentivized to jump in for the BTC-Core block reward plus mining fees.
-	users will set rather high fees since block time is longer, to make sure transaction is included in next block
- this incentivizes me even more to mine BTC Core
I think this is how it will play out... hash power will jump into the gap opened by NYA-followers, in order to take the money off the table.

This is great news, congratulations.
Happy to see merchant adoption ramp up.
I am currently working on a German Bitcoin Blog and plan to do a feature about you guys: A short tutorial about "How can I accept Bitcoins as a merchant?"
Hope the momentum will be kept up and you go into exponential growth... just like the USD vs. BTC curve ;)

Growth is exceptional, because Bitcoin is exceptional.
It truly is a disruptive technology and has the potential of a game changer.
We’re still in the very early stage and exponential growth is happening and required.
However, as you also stated, there is nothing to compare Bitcoin 1:1 to. It is neither a share, nor a currency in the “common sense”. With it spreading virally, growth should go on like that.
