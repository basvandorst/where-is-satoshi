Ever seen Margin Call? The Secretary of the Treasury failed to act and save Bear Stearns and the market rallied, counterintuitively. But then the system shock of their default caused ripples that would lead the a Secretary, Congress, and the President to intervene anyway.

I don't think he's a political prisoner. He went silent for years. Then when Newsweek had their blunder of a "reveal" of Satoshi, the real Satoshi logged into his (I think) LinkedIn (with a verifiable and distinguished post history) and posted something to the effect "Dorian Nakamoto is not me".

If you just know that it'll settle in the 3K-5K range, are you buying as much as your budget can afford? Since it's a discount right now? Otherwise you're just completely talking out of your ass.

I would say we're at a point where we've discovered the combustion engine. We aren't even at rockets much less the moon.
