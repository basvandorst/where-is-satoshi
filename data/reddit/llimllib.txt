Because inopia conjectured that amount of traffic above, and ttk2 seemed to think that was a reasonable number.
As I said, I don't understand the bitcoin node concept, but I do know about serving 5TB a month, so I chimed to note that the cost ttk2 was throwing around for that amount of data was off by an order of magnitude.

Anybody interested in economics should know that there's no such thing as "unlimited". I guarantee your 10 down/3 up provider will cut you off long before you reach 5TB/month.
You're looking at a business-class internet connection, at the least, to transfer that much data.

An order of magnitude makes a difference.
I could get 500gb on my home cable which is about half the speed, but 5TB is a horse of a different color.
Also, presumably, if money was depending on the connection being functional, you wouldn't want to rely on Comcast or really any consumer bandwidth provider.

Then argue with them, not me.

My bad, I apologize.
Still, let's do some math. If we assume you can saturate your connection (.01 gb/s) to download your 5tb (5000 gb), and that you don't have to upload anything, you're looking at:
(5000 / .01) / 60 / 60 / 24 ~= 5.79 days
to download 5tb. You're up over 11 days if you can saturate half of your connection, and you're up to your full month if you make any sort of real assumptions (download + upload, realistic average download and upload speeds).
And you're looking at a heck of unhappy provider with the right to terminate your connection at any time.
My point is, I don't think Comcast is going to be happy allowing you to run 5TB/month no matter what plan you're on, and you're going to need to get a fiber connection to run that much data.

And *mine* is just that none of them pay $100/month for hosting, they have dedicated fiber.
I don't know anything about bitcoin nodes, I was just saying you're an order of magnitude off on the monthly cost to run 5TB/month of data, because that's a thing I actually know a bit about :)
