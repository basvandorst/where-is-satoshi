Yeah, if that ETF is to be taken seriously, it will need to be backed up by bitcoin holdings.

Yes that is true but OB has the potential to make A LOT more products available for sale and it also could potentially "close the gap" in terms of people being forced to convert back and forth from fiat to bitcoin. That's why I say OB is the killer app for bitcoin. You could sell stuff on OB and then use the bitcoins to buy other items you need etc.
@_date: 2017-02-25 23:13:40
I remember a few years back when I first learned of bitcoin people would tell us that bitcoin would never go mainstream. Now I am sitting here listening to people on one of the largest business cable news channel talking about it as a serious investment. Boy time sure have changed.

Tor hidden services are centralized so you need someone to operate it and take a cut (fee). Open bazaar has no one to take a cut except for the moderators and they only come in if there is a dispute. Bought like 10 items from OB so far and all the transactions went flawless. I paid and got what I ordered a week or two later.

never heard of it but I'll look into it, thanks.
@_date: 2017-02-16 02:51:09
Honestly, OpenBazaar is one of the killer apps for bitcoin. If you want bitcoin to gain in value, the success of OB is going to be a big part of that since it gives bitcoin the ultimate use case - p2p decentralized exchange with a p2p decentralized money.
We need more sellers and buyers using it.

I completely agree. There is nothing to say that they won't pool their money and throw $50-100 milion developing an alt coin to try and defeat or demonize bitcoin.
Why would you want to use bitcoin when you can use our new alt coin where transfers are free, instant confirmation, pegged to the dollar, instant transfers between your fiat and the new altcoin etc.
@_date: 2017-02-11 05:12:45
Yes it is a great idea for that. The only difficult part is converting the foreign currency into bitcoin and then converting it back to fiat once you get to the new country. Bitcoin mostly dominates in Europe, USA and China. If you are in Africa or the middle east then it will be damn near impossible to convert your foreign currency to bitcoin. You would probably have to first convert to USD/Euro and then buy bitcoins. 
@_date: 2016-01-30 03:06:58
Bitcoin already has enough media exposure. The trick is making bitcoin user friendly and increasing the amount of products/services you can buy with bitcoin.

Yeah but there are many different venues to go to.
@_date: 2016-01-30 20:34:51
I can't see why the hell not. Could use the decentralized ledger system and then have a decentralized escrow system then have miners that verify the results of the bets. You would have to probably use multiple data sources for the verification of the winning scores but that should be easy since the results are widely posted after the game is over. That would be the basic version.
We could probably add in the more advanced features we see with sites like fanduel since at the end of the day it is just a smart contract system basically.
@_date: 2017-02-25 23:08:16
It will have more benefit of just introducing millions or billions to cryptocurrencies so even if it is competition, bitcoin will still benefit. The bigger risk for bitcoin is if bitcoin fails to adopt higher processing capacities. People aren't going to use bitcoin if it costs 20 bucks to send 5 dollars worth of bitcoin.

Really hard to say for sure at this point but I wouldn't underestimate it. I wouldn't be surprised if they all pitch in millions of dollars to make a bitcoin clone that doesn't have any of the claimed negative effects that bitcoin has. For example, this new bitcoin will be pegged to the dollar (no price volatility), no cost transfers between the new bitcoin and the traditional bank accounts, instant confirmations etc. They might even throw in some sort of marketing campaign to promote it. The whole plan would be to create a "better" bitcoin and show that the original bitcoin is worthless. The layman people will fall for it though. Just look at how many people won't use bitcoin because the price is too volatile.
The only thing we can do is continue to use bitcoin and increase the amount of commerce that occurs with bitcoin. Open Bazaar will be critical for the long-term success of bitcoin.

@_date: 2016-01-31 08:56:56
Yeah I'm surprised he made that big of a goof up. Fiat currencies are just as volatile as bitcoin. The only reason everyone thinks fiat currencies aren't volatile is because everyone looks at the dollar and the dollar is only as strong as the strength of the US economy. If the US economy takes a hit so will the dollar. Just look at what is happen to all the currencies of countries exporting oil like the Venezuela currency and Canadian currency. The cost of anything being imported into those countries is skyrocketing for their citizens.
@_date: 2016-01-31 22:33:14
I think the role of bitcoin is more to protect the common man from losing their savings to hyperinflation. The fact of the matter is that anyone who had their savings in Venezuela currency has been wiped clean. So overall there is still a benefit to it.
Also couldn't bitcoin allow people to bypass trade sanctions, to a certain extent? That could potentially help alleviate economic collapse. 
@_date: 2016-01-28 06:43:40
Unlikely but there are ways. You have to look at what other people did to convert hyper inflating fiat to bitcoin. 
One way is to get foreign tourists to visit the country and then convert their bitcoins into VEF which they will use to spend on their vacation. You'll have to of course pay a premium for the bitcoins to encourage people to actually do it. Another way might be to spend the VEF on some sort of good and then ship the good overseas where the buyer pays in bitcoin. 
You cannot trade the VEF through any banking system due to currency controls (which always pop up during periods of hyperinflation). 
@_date: 2016-01-22 03:21:31


Right but at the end of the day, you can cut oil production and make more revenue if the prices goes up. Of course the big problem is making sure that someone else doesn't step in to supply where you have cut.


I don't think Iran will be able to counter the cut from OPEC and bankrupt shale producers. Plus you have to factor in demand growth. Even with China slowing, they are still growing at 6% per year and are the largest car market in the world. Most are first time buyers.

That's true but that "insurance" isn't free. The merchant has to pay a processing fee to accept the CC. Then you have all the little gimmicks that are built into credit cards - like late payment fees, insane amounts of interest so on so forth. It is the users of credit cards who ultimately pay for the "insurance".

@_date: 2016-12-10 21:54:44
Bitcoin only has value because you can trade it, spend it, exchange it etc. Luckily bitcoin facilitates both and there are large markets for all those attributes. The people speculating should actually help bitcoin long-term to stabilize the price. 
I think a bigger problem is low transaction volume and the transaction fees being higher than normal, that forces certain exchanges out of market. Mainly low-value transactions. For low-value transactions we will probably see 3rd party processors that completely bypass the traditional bitcoin system and operate almost like a bank. Of course we would like to see all transactions being processed in the bitcoin network but with the low transaction volume that bitcoin can handle it simply is not realistic.

I learned about bitcoin when it was around $1. Back then I was interested in investing in stuff like gold and silver. One person commented and talked about bitcoin on a reddit post I made. Never heard about it so I researched it. Read Satoshi's whitepaper on it and it immediately clicked that this idea was brilliant. 
Unfortunately, I never did jump in on it back then. Other idiots convinced me that bitcoin was just going to be a bust. Had I invested even a small amount of money I would have been a multi-millionaire by now.
@_date: 2016-12-13 03:56:31
Did anyone not see this coming?
The main thing backing fiat currency is fear and control. As long as you have an army, police and people willing to enforce the laws you can always force people to use fiat. Even if the fiat collapses you can always make a "new" fiat and proclaim that the new fiat won't be like the old fiat. Rinse and repeat.
@_date: 2016-11-10 06:45:55

Might get flagged as suspicious if you start depositing large sums of cash in the bank. Looks like money laundering. Best method is to just start paying for everything with cash instead of using debit/credit cards.

@_date: 2016-10-26 05:44:02
That's right because the credit card companies are powerful enough to force the merchant's to mark up their products across the board to pay the fee. The only way you get out of it is by shopping at merchants that do no accept credit cards/bank cards. 
There are a few shops like that in my area but they cater to mostly low income people immigrant communities (who don't even have bank accounts to begin with). Their prices are by far the cheapest I've seen. The prices are even cheaper than Walmart.
Also some merchants charge a "convenience" fee for using a bank card, usually gas stations. 
@_date: 2016-10-26 05:12:12
I agree as well. If the fees keep going up and you can't get your transaction confirmed in a relatively short amount of time then it will simply encourage off-chain systems. Personally I think a two-system approach is good if it is implemented correctly. I could see a centralized system being developed that allows instantaneous transactions and would be used for small transactions or day-to-day transactions. That system would allow deposits and withdrawals in bitcoin. People would keep their "savings" in the block chain but do their day-to-day transactions using this other centralized system. 
Only problems I see is credit risk (of this centralized system defaulting) and increased fees. Also the anonymity aspect would also be comprised. 
Of course the ideal solution would be to have everything running in bitcoin block chain but without adjustments to the overall system, that does not look realistic.
@_date: 2016-10-26 04:56:01
Still cheaper than a credit card!

They'll just let the currency collapse and when it does they'll just make a new one and force their citizens to use it.

@_date: 2016-10-31 04:33:57
Don't they make money by charging the merchant a processing fee?
@_date: 2016-10-26 05:22:03
The merchant pays the fee and passes those costs on to the consumer. You are paying the fee indirectly but none the less, you are still paying the fee.
@_date: 2016-10-26 05:20:00
That's more of a flaw with paypal if you ask me. Scamming with paypal is very easy since you can always claim some bogus reason and paypal will almost always side with the buyer. I have been reversed payment scammed many times on ebay and I was not selling anything related to bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-10-21 01:01:26
No, I actually did pay with my debit card through paypal. You have to use paypal to buy on ebay.
@_date: 2016-10-20 07:56:33
This screen shot was taken today on 10/20/16 and yes the payment is still in "processing" status. The seller won't ship until the payment has cleared. Ebay purchase.
Pretty ridiculous if you ask me.
