Just follow along where he is giving talks or doing podcasts etc. TED talks are too restricted and not necessary when he has far better platforms to talk on that would allow him to reach much broader audiences

This is really bad on the teacher's part. Teacher probably heard a couple bad hyped up news reports on tv and formed a very uneducated opinion. Your son has obviously done much more research than they have. There are real ponzi schemes out there and that would also be a good lesson to learn but these are in no way related. Please do not conform to changing the topic to a ponzi scheme. Your son chose Bitcoin for his opinion not for their opinion on what to write on. Maybe you could tell the teacher how wrong they are and how they shouldn't put down their students in this way but I wouldn't make my son change the topic to something unrelated because the teacher isn't as smart as your son.

"Bitcoin" is "about" to go viral? Top searches from 2014 say it was already "viral"

I think the point to see if he meant bitcoin or ideas around bitcoin. I don't know.
