There are very, very few that even threaten BTC in any meaningful way. Many will argue none, but in the worst case scenario you could learn about like 5 more coins and understand 99% of this market and the major technologies/players. The vast majority are complete shit. We'll be downvoted for even entertaining this possibility, probably.
@_date: 2017-12-28 04:07:13


No. You don't have to report holdings, you just report when any gain is realized. If you hold 1000 for 5 years, sold only 10 of them, then you report the profit you made on the price difference on just those 10 coins from 5 years ago to the date you sold them. You don't need to keep the IRS informed of your holdings or the 990 you are still sitting on, only realized gains. Crypto-to-crypto trades follow this policy as well, not just crypto-to-fiat. So if you sold your 10 BTC for a bunch of LTC, or whatever, that's the same as selling it for USD and you also need to calculate your capital gains when that executes.
If you want to cash out, you sign up for Gemini, Coinbase, or some other exchange that can do wire transfers of your FIAT currency to your bank. Simple as that. From there, in the US anyway, it's your legal duty to self-report any gains involved in selling the BTC-&gt;FIAT, as described above, and that's that.
It's actually pretty simple, though can be a pain in the ass if you have many many individual trades across multiple exchanges, but taxation on crypto follows already established tax policy for any other type of property in the US. There's nothing new about the process or policy.

The problem is that Bitcoin is several orders of magnitude larger than any altcoin chain. This is like saying updating a worldwide CDN should be simple because you've handled the upgrade on a small business file server. The percentage of a community watching an update thread in altcoins compared to Bitcoin is a pretty damn big difference. Altcoins are almost purely speculation, and everyone in altcoins are primarily speculating hoping to buy low/sell high, or to bbe an early adopter of the next big thing. The communities are newer, much smaller, and much more attentive to development. Conversely there are a lot of "fire and forget" full nodes in Bitcoin, same with miners. To their deteriment? Sure, but it's still the case. It's not nearly as easy to pivot the BTC ecosystem as it is an altcoin with anywhere from 50-500 people in the entire ecosystem.
I'm not trying to put you or alt projects down, I've been heavily involved in altcoins in the past and have contributed development to several, but we need to keep things in perspective. I would agree though, that if a fork needs to happen better sooner than later. The logistics of doing so are massively more challenging, though.
@_date: 2015-12-28 22:46:29
Yes and until "enough people run it" you have a split network, and in an altcoin you don't have different groups with VC funding arguing over which fork is best, you have two groups in altcoins: the people paying attention and updated, and the people who haven't yet noticed. In Bitcoin you will possibly have portions of the network outright refusing to update. If that happens, if we end up with two or three different Bitcoins for more than a day or two of fighting for dominance, Bitcoin will be set back years and possibly fail completely due to lack of confidence. Imagine the media coverage of the failure of a decentralized internet protocol. This is not as simple as an altcoin, nobody in Cannacoin has invested millions into businesses and data centers where they have differing opinions on the direction of the protocol. It's really not even close to the same thing. Nobody is doing news stories on altcoins, CNBC isn't talking about altoins. This is a different world.

Ive been wondering when coins that were mined and have no transaction history will start commanding a premium in price OTC.
@_date: 2017-11-30 07:33:49
Coinbase had 8x their previous peak traffic today. Technical hurdle, I don't think it's an apt comparison.
@_date: 2017-11-10 01:13:03
Easily possible if you speculate on low-cap coins that are underappreciated. I'm up over x300 since 2014, and that's with plenty of big losses along the way as I learned my lessons. If you're just doing top 20 coins, the x20-x100 days are over for months/1 year long timeframes. But you can definitely find x20-x50's in altcoins a few times a year, just gotta put in the time to identify promising low-cap projects and don't go all-in on one or two of them. You can have 10 losers and be right once and make up for all of that and then some. It will cost you time, though, lots of time finding promising teams with low-attention projects and trying to discern them from the scam teams.

Been in the game enough years, brother, BTC could go to 0 tomorrow and it still would've been worth it - but I appreciate the sentiment! Although that would definitely curtail my FI/RE plans by a bit. ;D

Yes. Most people fail spectacularly at this, but if you want to try your hand go for it.

You're right that it is much more like gold than the dollar. But if you start researching the concept of "money", in economic terms, you will find that gold is better money than the dollar. There are certain properties that make something function as money better, and frankly, Bitcoin even improves upon gold in certain aspects. In economic terms, money and currency are related but not necessarily the same.
A main complaint you'll find about fiat money like the USD, is that it has been devalued repeatedly and consistently. It has an effectively infinite supply and is designed to inflate. And the tricks central banks play with interest rates and the money supply affect everybody drastically. Bitcoin was designed to remove centralized control and be better money than gold.
Whether it's a good currency for day to day use, you have some very valid concerns and even the Bitcoin community debates how to go forward and deal with those questions. Whether or not Bitcoin can/should be a currency or a commodity is a popular topic.
There are other cryptocurrencies that attempt to be more currency-like. We're in a time of discovery with this new tech, nothing is set in stone yet. And finally, as someone who has been in the space for 4 years now, and while I am super excited about the tech and think certain things like smart-contracts on a public ledger will open up new business models (like the WWW did), you're also correct that most of the price action and fervor is driven by speculation rather than immediate real world use. By far. But I don't believe that undermines the potential here, to me it's a big flashing sign to pay attention. Tulip craze and other speculative crazes don't last this many years and repeat themselves with increasing intensity - BTC ain't no tulip.

I see, thanks for sharing your perspective, I too would subscribe to such a society I just don't personally think it's compatible with a huge portion of human nature. I'm even down for collectivist hive mind that holds knowledge as true wealth and views the unknown as that which is sacred and must be explored as we spread across the stars, I just don't see it happening. At least, certainly not in my lifetime or numerous generations descended from me. Monetary systems are certainly easily wielded for oppression, especially in our modern world.
Anyway, reallly appreciate you clarifying your stance. Cheers.

That's the real gem of it, so many people don't realize they can still be early adopters. It's the same thing every cycle, "too late" followed by regret  within 2 years. Crypto needs to go up x25 from current values to even approach being 1% of the world's trading instruments (stocks, commodities, etc) and the tech reveals numerous potential business infrastructures that were previously unimagined or implausible, so it's not just some new spin on the same old thing. This is greenfield technology. We're barely getting started.

Durability, fungibility, scarcity - Bitcoin shares many of the same properties and arguably improves upon them. Other virtual currencies improve still further in aspects of a good currency.
Point is, it's not based on nothing.
@_date: 2017-10-13 09:33:27
Correct velocity is important. I don't want to share my views on this in this subreddit, but I also think Bitcoin is a sub-optimal currency and other virtual currencies are better designed for such use cases - but they don't take too kindly around here to talk about that. ;)

Right but multiple onlookers politely asked you to expound on your point. Can you please elaborate on your explanations, or point to concise sources that do?
@_date: 2017-07-19 21:21:59
No, both of these wallets call out to other nodes that provide blockchain access for them. This is also configurable in Electrum (not sure in Exodus) - which comes in handy if a chain split happens.
@_date: 2017-07-19 18:42:32
Common complaint about Exodus is it's closed-source, technically the creators could be logging (stealing) private keys and you wouldn't know. My personal complaint about Exodus as a desktop wallet, is that if you leave the wallet open you can view the 12-word recovery seed. You do not need to re-authenticate to view that seed, if the wallet is open the seed is just one click away for anybody - so DO NOT leave Exodus sitting open on your home/work computer or some such. Open it, use it, close it.
For these reasons it's not my favorite. The upsides of course are a super nice interface and support for, what, like 10 different coins in the same wallet? Something like that. If you only need to store BTC I personally like Electrum. Electrum [also has a guide about how to spend coins on multiple forks of BTC]( if a split does happen, so I like knowing my wallet is ready to help me in that situation.

I mean, FWIW "shitty diets" that avoid animal protein sources have tons of evidence to back up the fact that it significantly increases lifespan (statistically speaking of course). Primarily through significantly lower risk of heart disease, which is the leading cause of death in the US at least, and I think the world as well?
I'm not anti-omnivore nor vegan, just throwing it out there. Dunno why you would shit on people making healthy choices and trying to live longer/healthier.

Funny, I specifically stopped using them because their UI was showing me incorrect information about my account (It said I had X limit to purchase but would not allow me to purchase, saying my limit was exceeded - I hadn't bought anything for months and the UI itself said full limit was available). If I can't trust the UI I certainly don't want to hope that it's "just a UI bug" while the specifics of my problem hinted to a back-end issue. Support was nonresponsive so I closed my account. Fuuuuck that.

The main point of contention for my post was the implied disdain for an inflationary monetary system, not the logistics and infrastructure that it rides on. As far as the infrastructure goes, I'm pretty sure anybody who's spent any time in crypto would largely agree on most points related to the system itself. I'm talking monetary policy, printing money, debt, etc.
@_date: 2017-06-29 19:07:37
I'm generally on the same page but this stupid system is what has allowed ridiculous GDP growth and truly unchained capitalism.
Whether or not you think that's a good thing, well that's the real debate. I personally think it's obviously unsustainable and will end in a lot of pain for a lot of people. But it also fueled 100 years of incredible prosperity and technological growth (on the widest, macro level, not individual).
It's not as simple as most people like to paint it.
@_date: 2017-06-29 20:54:35
Because printing of money and fractional reserves is what allows banks to lend much more readily, which means more access to capital for business, which is what massively accelerates GDP growth.
I agree it's entirely possible you can fuel a society on a decentralized system - I"m not defending the infrastructure around this banking system, I'm talking merely about the economic theory that it is built upon. If you want a fixed supply and you don't want fractional reserves to be legal (which is how commercial banks print money, not just the Fed) then we would not, IMO, have experienced the same level of GDP growth and technological development. So if you're just talking about a decentralized infrastructure, and it could accomplish the same thing, sure, I'm on board and eager to support that discussion. If you're positing that Bitcoin or something very much like it in economic design could've, I flatly disagree and I think most people with some knowledge of economics would.
@_date: 2017-06-29 22:42:00
Yes but its not just increased by printing -- trade, investment, production all contribute to that velocity -- all of which requires access to capital, which is made absurdly easy with fractional reserves and low rates, no?
