Just one more piece of evidence that shows Roger Ver is more concerned with using politics to game the market than actually believing in the ideology behind the politics he pushes. He doesn't give a shit about bitcoin, freedom, privacy, individuality, or anything else besides money and power.

but iam looking forward to schnorr and Graftroot.
With Schnorr, there would be a cost benefit to using the most private option, which might just provide the right incentive for wallets to implement it and make it the go-to option for everyone.

Personally I don’t think such blatant advertising should be allowed on this sub. Pretending it is not an advertisement by mentioning the percentage increase in profits in the title should not be a loophole that the mods allow. The rules clearly say that shops can post announcing when they first start accepting bitcoin, but any post after that is not considered news and is not allowed. OP advertises his expensive “art” every week here and on other subs.

 MIAMI — When the International Monetary Fund predicted this year that hyperinflation in Venezuela could top 13,000 percent, it seemed as if the South American country’s economic outlook could not get any worse.
It just did.
With the situation in the country deteriorating faster than expected, the IMF has unveiled a far more severe prognosis, saying that Venezuela’s hyperinflation is poised to reach an annualized rate of 1 million percent by year’s end.
That inflation rate is set to catapult socialist Venezuela into a rogue’s gallery of nations that have suffered the worst inflation rates in history. 
Venezuela’s “is one of the most severe hyperinflation situations that we’ve known about since the beginning of the 20th century,” said Robert Rennhack, deputy director of the IMF’s Western Hemisphere Department. 
According to a study by Steve H. Hanke, a professor of applied economics at Johns Hopkins University, Venezuela’s inflationary spiral as of May ranked as the 23rd highest ever recorded. The worst case on file remains Hungary after World War II, when inflation ran so rampant that prices doubled every 15 hours. More recently, Zimbabwe in the late 2000s and the former Yugoslavia in the mid-1990s saw peaks requiring calculators to sort out snowballing rates. 
Fish for flour? Barter is Venezuela's new currency
In the face of hyperinflation and a scarcity of cash, Venezuelans are increasingly turning to bartering for basic transactions. (Reuters)
[Maduro faces reelection as Venezuela deteriorates]
Venezuela’s inflation is soaring as the economy has been broken by failed socialist policies, corruption and a collapsing oil industry. In addition, President Nicolás Maduro — the anointed successor of Hugo Chávez, who died in 2013 — has sought to cling to power by weakening institutions, packing the courts and, his critics say, stealing elections.  
Bills of the near-worthless local currency, the bolívar, are scarce — with the government having a hard time even paying for the paper needed to print them. Instead, the government is simply creating reams of electronic money paid into bank accounts, meaning that even small transactions are increasingly being done by bank cards and money transfers rather than in cash.
Maduro has tried to fix the problem, even creating a cyber-currency, the petro, which is theoretically backed by oil supplies. But nothing has worked.
The most extreme solutions in other countries have included abandoning local currencies altogether and adopting, for instance, the U.S. dollar. Yet such a move may be considered anathema in Venezuela, where Maduro has decried the United States as “the empire” out to destroy his nation. 
[Venezuela’s economy is so bad, parents are leaving their children at orphanages]
The country may be running out of options, however. Inflation is so high that Venezuelans are abandoning their nation in droves. An estimated 2 million are expected to exit this year, bringing to 3.8 million the total who have left since 2016.
A week ago, dishwasher soap cost 3.8 million bolívares; today, it’s 4.9 million. A kilogram of chicken — or 2.2 pounds — cost 3.3 million last week; today, it’s 4.2 million. 
Yaimy Flores, a 30-year-old Caracas housewife whose husband, a janitor, earns the minimum wage of 5,196,000 bolívares a month — worth about $3 at the black-market rate — said the family income can stretch to buy only two pounds of rice and a pound of cheese each month. They receive lentils, corn flour and a few other items via a government program. But the family has mostly cut out proteins and can no longer afford soaps and shampoos.
“We now have a tiny bit of soap left,” Flores said. “What we do is cut it in parts so that we’re conscious of how much we should use. I don’t know what our plan is when we finish that soap. I haven’t bought shampoo since last year.”
The IMF may even be underestimating the severity of Venezuela’s hyperinflation. Ecoanalitica, a Caracas-based financial firm, predicts that the inflation rate will shoot well past 1 million, reaching 1.4 million percent by December.
For a country that was once South America’s richest per capita, “it means a brutal cycle of impoverishment,” said Asdrúbal Oliveros, director of Ecoanalitica. “For a majority of Venezuelans that depend on their jobs and don’t have dollar savings or receive help from their family members abroad, an inflation like this one, that reaches more than 1 million, condemns them to poverty in a drastic way.”

For me, forking bitcoin.org is motivated by the constant alienation of frequent contributors. Over the past several years, both Cobra and Will Binns have been doing some things unilaterally that have alienated many frequent contributors. Notably, Will added a donation address to Bitcoin.org which, as far as anyone knows, is one of his personal addresses (no multisig).
Cobra has been unilaterally adding many more things to the website without community agreement, i.e. without a Pull Request. For example, he added a post about Segwit2x which was much too strongly worded that resulted in a lot of backlash against the post and required it to be reverted. Only then was a PR made and the post revised and discussed.
Most recently, there was the Paxful sponsorship which really acted like an advertisement. It was merged without anyone in the community explicitly ACK'ing it. There have been several other such instances of the maintainers and domain owners taking such unilateral actions. These have driven away contributors and make the site less community maintained and more like someone's personal website.
There is also the fact that many people perceive the primary domain owner, Cobra, to be unstable. People believe that he may turn bitcoin.org into a bcash site, although this is not why I have forked bitcoin.org

that is the guy, who is controlling bitcoin,org ! let that sink in.

@_date: 2018-05-05 17:03:11
yeah, nice advertising for them to do that again and again. scammy as hell.

you still used LN coins to do that

oh boy

i say 1000 USD just to get some downvotes.
@_date: 2018-05-03 19:15:46
i "overpaid" so many things in the past - just rebuy in the next days and there is no problem. use your coins people.
@_date: 2018-05-06 15:33:42
you must add an /s ;)
@_date: 2018-05-25 14:56:11
just use it for small amounts, yes, it is safe enough. i already did 4 purchases via LN and the transaction fee was zeroooooo (0.00001 cent).
open 2-3 channels with well connected nodes and you can pay anyone.
it is fucking amazing and will get better and better.
@_date: 2018-05-04 08:37:35
nice but 900 USD is a bit too much. 
make it 199,- USD
@_date: 2018-05-05 07:57:06


@_date: 2018-08-06 06:46:23

@_date: 2018-08-26 07:02:30
Personally I don’t think such blatant advertising should be allowed on this sub. Pretending it is not an advertisement by mentioning the percentage increase in profits in the title should not be a loophole that the mods allow. The rules clearly say that shops can post announcing when they first start accepting bitcoin, but any post after that is not considered news and is not allowed. OP advertises his expensive “art” every week here and on other subs.
@_date: 2018-05-28 08:14:52
= Bcash is a shitcoin created by Roger Ver and Jihad Wu (Bitmain).
@_date: 2018-05-23 06:44:06

(only mistake is, Jihan would not care when Roger is defrauding other people, he is a scammer himself)
@_date: 2018-08-30 08:12:28
fake, he is not crying.
@_date: 2018-08-19 05:19:41
there is also a list of most of his lies and tactics (you cant cover everything)
there is also something on github.
people should leave appropriate feedback for this scam site and apps.

is also scammy to make $250k a year with advertising when you recieved the domain from Satoshi for free and volunteers never recieved a dime for their work. where can i read that Cobra and Theymos?!
@_date: 2018-08-05 09:50:38
he said it "felt" secure. of course it isnt ;)
@_date: 2018-05-07 07:11:41

@_date: 2018-08-10 14:56:15
they will use "Blockchain" and spent 10 billion on it....to end up with Bitcoin in 10 years.
@_date: 2018-08-29 16:43:11
Probably Roger is doing that after he sold his Bcash
@_date: 2018-05-19 08:03:39
most people that attend would not even know how to pay with bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-05-01 09:32:51
this. the code and usefulnes must (will) speak for itsself.
@_date: 2018-08-26 16:25:30
it is a Bitmain company so good luck for that. they will add Bcash before LN.

i started learning about bitcoin in 2012/13 and after two years i thought, that this is insane growth...today you cant even see that on a chart, its just a flat line - lol
we are nowhere near a peak. at the moment miners use 14nm chips and this industry is just starting. 0.5nm seems to be the technical limit at the moment, but it wont stop after that, humans are clever, there is always a way for improvments.
Samsung and others are not even mining on their own. that will start too in a few years.
@_date: 2018-05-28 08:18:25
the problem is, he says if you cant change it (the blockchain), it is a problem.
so use a database.
@_date: 2018-08-02 16:20:05

This website ist owned by the former politician Roger Ver (people call him "Bitcoin Judas"). He is expanding his influence with this and is attacking bitcoin since years. He even wants to install a Bitcoin CEO and tries to centralize the development of bitcoin. In upvoting this crap, you are helping Roger Ver with his plans to form Bitcoin in a centralized Shitcoin and hurting your own investment in a free bitcoin. Roger Ver sold most of his bitcoins and now holds large amounts of Bcash which he tries to pump.

Banks can’t create base money. Only the government or central bank can do that. However, a bank account balance is merely a statement of what a bank owes its customer and, within certain legal limits, the bank can declare it owes a customer as much as it likes without needing a monetary deposit first. A borrower’s IOU or other security is all that is needed.


They have some requirements to give loans. But they also make the laws, so it is a good business :)
There are certain risks inherent in lending to an unknown and the cost of savings interest rates plus operating costs means that a bank can only have a low % of loans default to make a viable profit.

Fun fact: When you take out a loan from a normal bank, that money does not come from other customers. The bank itself creates it out of nothing and deposites 1% of the sum at the central bank.

just keep in mind that when you run a LN routing node, you have to save the state of your channels or you can lose all your money in LN!
@_date: 2019-03-26 11:04:03
This is good for bitcoin

@_date: 2018-10-20 16:19:25
true, but i guess the chance that 1 BTC will be 1 Mio in 15 years are not that bad. 
(and no, it wont exist a hell of inflation then)

@_date: 2018-10-24 07:55:29
keep in mind that bitmain may be responspible for 35-50% of the pool mining hashrate. so actually they dont own that hashrate, people could switch.

you also have to look at GDP. just looking at debt isnt a good measure.
also look at japan debt to gdp levels.
and if the shit hits the fan, you have tools you can use as a gov, like forcing the citizens to buy bonds:

OP asks a valid question which everyone should answer for himself. It is a tough question to answer.
@_date: 2018-10-06 08:07:30

@_date: 2018-10-06 08:06:40

another example to see that Jihad Wu &amp; Bitmain will attack bitcoin every time he sees a chance.

it takes 1 second to process and on average 10 minutes to clear. that is very fast.
with LN you have 1 second to process and 1 second to clear. beat that.
@_date: 2018-10-12 16:26:11
very nice, i hope u get tons of new customers for using LN already :)
@_date: 2018-10-20 07:43:25
manage to get 1 BTC, hold it for 10-15 years and you will proabably have the same outcome.

Samourai is nice but after they removed fiat values it is not usable anymore.
i hope Wasabi wallet will bring better UI and privacy.
@_date: 2018-10-27 16:25:33


and that is a no go if you talk about security and privacy
@_date: 2018-10-26 09:18:07
that was fun. they did it 4-5 times in the good old days.

nice website, gj
@_date: 2018-06-12 20:19:00
Shitmain is getting bigger and bigger. We need to do more to fight back, because they will attack again at some point. First steps:
@_date: 2018-06-27 16:18:45
now they can go all in on easy peasy, lemon squeezy.
@_date: 2018-06-26 08:10:49
what is the bitcoin halving?
how many coins are there?
@_date: 2018-06-07 11:29:14
No they wont, but we will achieve it anyway ;)
And not many govs have the power to do alot anyway. 
They can´t even monitor everything what happens on TOR, so i have hope.
@_date: 2018-06-27 16:26:50
Paypal is indeed shit
@_date: 2018-06-05 06:39:34
and all other bitcoiners thank you for that ;)

if 1 mio USD buys u only 1 hamburger within 10 years, one Bitcoin will be at 1000000000000000000000000000000000000000 USD.

thanks btc.com, for the bitcoin gods!
@_date: 2018-06-22 16:42:24
He will sell and rebuy until he has 0 bitcoin and 0 dollar.
@_date: 2018-06-08 17:24:09
sometimes it can take 1-5 minutes for LN to find a route but that is okay. and it will get better/faster over time.
@_date: 2018-06-08 07:17:25
they can do it, they just need another 1000000000000000 millions!

@_date: 2018-06-29 08:58:26
they cant buy drugs too (i dont like drugs) and prostitution. these things will always be here as long as humans exist, but india, they will be just more expensive ;) .
@_date: 2018-06-07 11:20:57
Similar to the TOR network, where they monitor exit nodes, but hopefully will never be able to monitor everything.
I guess LN encrypts the data so no LN node knows where a transaction is comming from. But when NSA has 80% of the (cheap to launch nodes), my concern is, that they can monitor alot.
What can we do to make LN more robust?
@_date: 2018-06-18 07:34:16
it never reached 20k so far :P
@_date: 2018-06-06 19:55:31
Hopefully, but for now just a shitcoin.

Bitpay is now a hostile company. This is why they make it hard to use it.
I guess they would switch to Bcash if they could - if anyone would use it.

Please downvote bitcoin,com spam! 
This website ist owned by the former politician Roger Ver (people call him "Bitcoin Judas"). He is expanding his influence with this and is attacking bitcoin since years. He even wants to install a Bitcoin CEO and tries to centralize the development of bitcoin. In upvoting this crap, you are helping Roger Ver with his plans to form Bitcoin in a centralized Shitcoin and hurting your own investment in a free bitcoin. Roger Ver sold most of his bitcoins and now holds large amounts of Bcash which he tries to pump.
His website buys old reddit accounts to post this spam.
Bought accounts:

what do you want to say with that?
Decreasing mining difficulty doesn't increase number of coins, the algorithm adjusts so we find a block on average every 10 minutes regardless of difficulty; that's how it works with Bitcoin anyways.

@_date: 2019-02-22 11:07:54
One of Bitcoin's strengths - the most important in my opinion even - is the low degree of trust you need in others.
If you use a full node for your incoming transactions, you know that there was no cheating anytime in the history of your coins:
•	Nobody ever created money out of nothing (except for mimers, and only according to a well-defined schedule).
•	Nobody ever spent coins without holder their private key.
•	Nobody spent the same coins twice (but see further).
•	Nobody violated any of the other tricky rules that are needed to keep the system in check (difficulty, proof of work, DoS protection, ...).
... with one exception: because there is a need to pick a winner in presence of multiple competing valid versions of the ledger, (a majority of) miners have the authority to pick the version of the block chain that wins. This means their power is limited to choosing the order in which otherwise valid transactions occur, up to and including the right to delay them indefinitely. But they cannot make invalid transaction look valid to a full node.
If you are not running a full node, the amount of trust you're placing in others increases.
•	SPV nodes (such as some mobile clients, and Multibit) place a blind trust in the majority of miners, without checking validity of the blockchain they produce. It still requires a majority of miners to mislead an SPV node, but they can make it believe anything (including "You received 10000000 BTC!"). The reason why this does not happen is because full nodes would not accept such blocks, and assuming a large portion of the ecosystem does rely on full nodes, miners who do this would not see their blocks accepted by the larger economy, resulting in them wasting money.
•	Centralized services (most webwallets) make the user trust whatever the site says. They can claim anything.
So I hope you now see the importance of full nodes in this model. If you run a full node somewhere on the network, and nobody looks at the transactions it validates, it is indeed contributing to the network, but it is not helping with the reduction of trust.
Look at it another way: if only a few large players in the Bitcoin ecosystem were running full nodes, it only requires a malicious intent, or an attack/threat against them, to change the system's rules, as nobody else is validating.
Doing transactions in the Bitcoin ecosystem helps the Bitcoin currency. 
Running a full node helps the network. Using a full node helps you and the ecosystem reduce the need for trust.

at some point some bad actors will attack again. maybe then we fight for more fungibility against Coinbase, Eric Vorhees, Roger Ver and so on.

its really NOT a pyramid scheme. if you think it is, make some research.

@_date: 2019-02-10 11:37:55
One of Bitcoin's strengths - the most important in my opinion even - is the low degree of trust you need in others.
If you use a full node for your incoming transactions, you know that there was no cheating anytime in the history of your coins:
•	Nobody ever created money out of nothing (except for mimers, and only according to a well-defined schedule).
•	Nobody ever spent coins without holder their private key.
•	Nobody spent the same coins twice (but see further).
•	Nobody violated any of the other tricky rules that are needed to keep the system in check (difficulty, proof of work, DoS protection, ...).
... with one exception: because there is a need to pick a winner in presence of multiple competing valid versions of the ledger, (a majority of) miners have the authority to pick the version of the block chain that wins. This means their power is limited to choosing the order in which otherwise valid transactions occur, up to and including the right to delay them indefinitely. But they cannot make invalid transaction look valid to a full node.
If you are not running a full node, the amount of trust you're placing in others increases.
•	SPV nodes (such as some mobile clients, and Multibit) place a blind trust in the majority of miners, without checking validity of the blockchain they produce. It still requires a majority of miners to mislead an SPV node, but they can make it believe anything (including "You received 10000000 BTC!"). The reason why this does not happen is because full nodes would not accept such blocks, and assuming a large portion of the ecosystem does rely on full nodes, miners who do this would not see their blocks accepted by the larger economy, resulting in them wasting money.
•	Centralized services (most webwallets) make the user trust whatever the site says. They can claim anything.
So I hope you now see the importance of full nodes in this model. If you run a full node somewhere on the network, and nobody looks at the transactions it validates, it is indeed contributing to the network, but it is not helping with the reduction of trust.
Look at it another way: if only a few large players in the Bitcoin ecosystem were running full nodes, it only requires a malicious intent, or an attack/threat against them, to change the system's rules, as nobody else is validating.
Doing transactions in the Bitcoin ecosystem helps the Bitcoin currency. 
Running a full node helps the network. Using a full node helps you and the ecosystem reduce the need for trust.

You will never convince 100% of the bitcoiners to change that. So i can guarantee you, it will never change.
It's worth noting though that if the developers did change rules without the consent and will of the node operators, they'd quickly find themselves contributing to a project that doesn't communicate with the rest of the network anymore.

One in 100 might learn more about because you told him. but 99 will not. that is the experience alot of us made too OP :)
You seem to be a curious person in life, that might be your advantage!
i also noticed that alot of people hate to talk about money in general. so dont start with debt, gold and stuff. they dont care, that is okay. 
But the same people might ask at some point, why you can travel the world and do what you want in life too ;-)
- well, it starts with curiosity.

so you want to sell bitcoin on paxful do make some money right?
i would guess that in the begin with a low reputation you will earn less and after some time and with bigger amounts, it may increase.
make sure you are meeting people at public spots.
make sure you dont make software mistakes (low fees = long time to wait; or double spends etc)

locations  of  cryptocurrency  mining  operations  in 
China,   we   have   shown   that   contrary   to   the 
common  narrative,  the  vast  majority  of  global 
Bitcoin   mining   capacity   (minimum   77.6%)   is 
running on renewable energy.  
The  coincidence  of  high  renewables  penetration 
and  the  location  of  Bitcoin  mining  operations 
cannot not be dismissed as chance. While current 
data on a still-nascent industry is lacking, further 
studies  may  yet  prove  that,  at  least  in  terms  of 
the environment, not only does cryptocurrency do 
no harm, it could actually be doing good. 
Bitcoin   mining   may   in   fact   be   acting   as   an 
electricity  buyer  of  last  resort  [41],  creating  a 
highly   mobile   base-demand   for   any   electricity 
sources  able  to  produce  at  prices  below  current 
producers,  regardless  of  location.  If  demand  for 
Bitcoin   mining   keeps   increasing,   its   demand 
alone  could  facilitate  opportunities  for  tapping 
highly  productive  renewables  locations  in  areas 
that today would be uneconomically remote

@_date: 2019-01-10 09:35:23
OP, you can find out more here:
Roger Ver is a well-known scammer
@_date: 2019-01-09 17:51:19
OP, good point.
@_date: 2019-01-28 11:19:42

@_date: 2019-01-31 17:57:58

@_date: 2018-11-23 10:20:48
so he tells me bitcoin is like amazon?
i should take out a loan to buy more bitcoin...
@_date: 2019-01-18 17:15:27
maybe it was not an accident that you got filmed OP ;) ?
@_date: 2019-01-19 11:48:41
@_date: 2019-01-27 11:23:42

Laki sent me Bcash instead of Bitcoin, i banned him.
@_date: 2019-01-06 10:48:46
2019 might get pretty boring if you just look at the price
@_date: 2018-11-28 10:32:26
Hey OP, down the rabbit hole:
@_date: 2018-11-25 10:17:54
Jihad Wu is bleeding money and shitting his pants. He and the SV side both have to sell all BTC that they mine to fund the war.
@_date: 2019-01-20 17:22:39
nice demo
@_date: 2019-01-04 10:49:15
hrhr, i like that analogy.

@_date: 2019-01-06 10:47:29

Thanks Roger
@_date: 2019-01-16 10:43:20
use Bitstamp instead, not the new boys.
@_date: 2019-01-29 17:43:09
Stop using Bitpay! It is one of the worst companies in this space after Jihad Wu and Roger Ver invested in it.
@_date: 2019-01-03 10:33:48
Where is "Eat out from 5 pounds"?
(probably 10 pounds today)

@_date: 2018-03-01 17:06:29
it is hilarious to read the comments there, Roger gets rekt again ;-D
he will never stop scamming people.

The guy on the left is Roger Ver. He is a longtime scammer in the bitcoin scene.

Shitmain/Bitmain will get more competition. One of the new competitors is Halong Mining which already shipped alot of miners, more will follow.
@_date: 2018-03-10 09:32:40
so it should be here
@_date: 2019-01-23 10:11:55
@_date: 2019-01-05 10:59:45
i use Lightning Wallet aka BLW and it is working very good. UI could be better though.
@_date: 2019-01-06 16:44:35
yep, indeed.
but the message "blocks are too small" is easier to understand for most.
@_date: 2018-02-19 08:19:30
After Roger Ver plan of BU failed, he launched Bcash to scam even more people.
@_date: 2018-03-27 20:40:54
his profil pic nails it
@_date: 2019-01-07 10:14:46
true, and with batching and LN you cant really see how many transactions there are

Please downvote bitcoin,com spam! 
This website ist owned by the former politician Roger Ver (people call him "Bitcoin Judas"). He is expanding his influence with this and is attacking bitcoin since years. He even wants to install a Bitcoin CEO and tries to centralize the development of bitcoin. In upvoting this crap, you are helping Roger Ver with his plans to form Bitcoin in a centralized Shitcoin and hurting your own investment in a free bitcoin. Roger Ver sold most of his bitcoins and now holds large amounts of Bcash which he tries to pump.
His website buys old reddit accounts to post this spam.
Bought accounts:
Keep bitcoin strong and decentralized, downvote this malicious spam :-) !
@_date: 2019-01-03 17:57:57
i guess with a difficulty of 1, it was pretty fast.

the fines are way lower than the gains. thats a great system to be in if you are a bankster ;-)
@_date: 2018-02-04 11:19:49
CoinCenter and some others are doing this since years.
@_date: 2019-01-20 11:22:04
@_date: 2019-01-17 18:04:29
there were some e-money attempts before bitcoin. the creators ended up in jail or got sued.

LOL! Nice twisting here. He would never be able to do anything to bitcoin so he just "sees it as experiment" ;-D
Good old scammer Craig. That fraudster did alot of good things to bitcoin actually. He sucked all idiots to Bcash and BcashV or whatever his crypto is. And he is entertaining :-P

@_date: 2019-01-24 10:07:53
you can also create financial products which would do that. thing is, its not bitcoin anymore but more people would store their coins in the bank if it happens
@_date: 2019-01-07 10:13:42
nice idea
@_date: 2019-01-01 18:37:14


and only then my friend.
@_date: 2019-01-27 11:16:49


lol - when was your last bitcoin transaction my friend ;-) ?
 it is 2 CENTS at the moment, with LN it is "ZERO"

great news
@_date: 2019-01-19 11:39:52
the headline is not about the idea, that bitcoin doesnt need improvements. 
the idea is, that you cant launch a better bitcoin from scratch at this point, and i strongly agree.
@_date: 2019-01-12 11:17:46

Use a full node over TOR. you dont have to open a port in that case. TOR full nodes are very valuable for the network too. might be a win win :)

two highly controversial figures: theymos and cobra.
theymos is also in control of this sub and the bitcointalk forum which is a problem when one guy has so much power.
cobra is a big Bcash supporter (pls check twitter for example!) and probably working with Roger Ver at that point.
bitcoin,org was also already forked because some members thought, that this project is doomed.
a few months ago, bitcoin,org became a -for profit- website where you can buy ads. keep in mind, this website and the content was build by volunteer around the world...

Roger Ver (owner of bitcoin.com), John McAfee, and Jihan Wu (owner of btc.com and Bitmain founder) discuss the future of Bitcoin, and the creation of Bitcoin Cash (BCH). Roger Ver went on to redirect bitcoin.com to Bitcoin Cash, and has done several media campaigns introducing “Bitcoin Core” terminology. Jihan Wu set Bitcoin Cash mining structure to maximum disruption to Bitcoin. Together, they fought to prevent Segwit technology, increase transaction fees, and weaken the culture of Bitcoin.

I don’t think such blatant advertising should be allowed on this sub. Pretending it is not an advertisement by mentioning the percentage increase in profits in the title should not be a loophole that the mods allow. The rules clearly say that shops can post announcing when they first start accepting bitcoin, but any post after that is not considered news and is not allowed. OP advertises his expensive “art” every week here and on other subs.
@_date: 2018-02-21 08:07:13

BlackRock has set up a working group to investigate ways the world’s largest asset manager can take advantage of the fast-growing cryptocurrency market despite its chief executive lambasting the bitcoin sector.
The $6.3tn investment powerhouse has created a team from different parts of the business to investigate cryptocurrencies and their underlying infrastructure, blockchain, according to two people familiar with the matter.
The working group, which includes New York multi-asset investment strategist Terry Simpson, will examine whether BlackRock should invest in bitcoin futures, one of the people said.
Sources said the team of experts is also looking at what BlackRock’s competitors are doing with cryptocurrencies and how that could impact its business. The working group will present its findings to senior management.
A BlackRock spokeswoman said the company had been “looking at blockchain technology for several years” but declined to comment on cryptocurrencies specifically.
The creation of the working group marks a turnaround for the company after Larry Fink, the chief executive, said late last year that bitcoin was merely “speculative” and that the only reason it thrived was due to its anonymity. “It is an instrument people use for money laundering,” Fink said.
At the time, the CEO said bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies were “far from” being an opportunity for institutional investors, adding that none of BlackRock’s clients wanted to invest in it.
READ Stiglitz, Roubini and Rogoff lead joint attack on bitcoin
BlackRock is not the first to change tack. Last year, JPMorgan’s CEO Jamie Dimon called cryptocurrencies a “fraud” and said he would sack any banker he caught trading them. The bank, however, later moved its head of fintech into a new role to explore the use of digital currencies.
Digital currencies continue to polarise the City with some of the largest names in finance including Mark Mobius and Davide Serra and economists Joseph Stiglitz and Nouriel Roubini openly speaking out against them.
However, firms in the City are increasingly interested in getting into the asset class. Fidelity Investments, which manages $2.4tn in assets, has begun a hiring spree, while Goldman Sachs said in May that it is setting up a crypto trading desk.

Billionaire Steven Cohen has invested in a hedge fund focusing on cryptocurrencies and blockchain-based companies, according to a person familiar with the matter.
The investment was made through his Cohen Private Ventures, said the person, who asked not to be named because the information is private. The hedge fund, Autonomous Partners, was started last year by Arianna Simpson, an early advocate of cryptocurrencies. It has also secured investments from Union Square Ventures, Coinbase Inc. Chief Executive Officer Brian Armstrong and Craft Ventures Co-Founder David Sacks, Simpson said in an interview Thursday.
Simpson said she is interested in investing in cryptocurrencies that serve as general purpose money and companies that are building the next generation of financial infrastructure. Autonomous Partners also invests in some large cap cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, she said.
Cohen Private Ventures invests in private equity and other longer-term investments on behalf of Cohen, who runs Point72 Asset Management. A representative for the firm declined to comment.
Crypto-dedicated funds have taken off recently. Of the 249 crypto funds that have opened, 70 percent did so last year, according to Autonomous Research. Despite this year’s collapse in digital coin values, hedge fund managers and other investors have continued to wade into the asset class.

@_date: 2018-04-24 15:57:53
Never stop the goxxxing boys ;)
@_date: 2018-04-19 15:57:37
i hope they will go bankrupt one day but that will take time, they make huge amounts of money.
@_date: 2018-04-05 10:55:56
he will find another 100000 bitcoins in a "lost" wallet next month!
@_date: 2018-04-24 19:27:42
Roger Ver is a fraudster. So it is natural for him :)


@_date: 2018-04-03 15:15:39
learn more about bitcoin. this will help alot in the future.
@_date: 2018-04-08 08:57:30
Wow, that is great news! Hopefully Roger´s account will be banned too at some point. This criminal should be locked up.
@_date: 2018-04-04 07:51:17
25% clapped? Still shocking...Roger Ver should be locked up.
@_date: 2018-04-06 09:06:20


sure, there are more than 3 efts in the pipeline that will hold bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-04-05 12:23:56
they should use bits as a standard
@_date: 2018-04-04 07:52:02
More fake libertarians are getting dumber because of Roger, Bcash people are literally turning into full retards because of Roger.
@_date: 2018-07-04 18:07:03
imagine every shop that sells something for bitcoin would post it here 3 times a month. know u understand.
@_date: 2018-04-10 18:00:23
cant see it atm on their website...
@_date: 2018-04-27 07:54:46
Vorhees tried selling Bcash as Bitcoin on his shape shift exchange until the community called him on it. His plans was to take Bitcoin but give back 2xCoins instead.
Vorhees and like 3 or 4 other Ceo's led that failed 2x scam attempt to usurp the Bitcoin network.
@_date: 2018-04-25 13:30:41

was a good first test :)
@_date: 2018-04-27 08:18:49

@_date: 2018-07-12 08:41:03

Please downvote bitcoin,com spam! 
This website ist owned by the former politician Roger Ver (people call him "Bitcoin Judas"). He is expanding his influence with this and is attacking bitcoin since years. He even wants to install a Bitcoin CEO and tries to centralize the development of bitcoin. In upvoting this crap, you are helping Roger Ver with his plans to form Bitcoin in a centralized Shitcoin and hurting your own investment in a free bitcoin. Roger Ver sold most of his bitcoins and now holds large amounts of Bcash which he tries to pump.
His website buys old reddit accounts to post this spam.

How much did Roger pay for Cobra´s account this time?

not that good as using the sign behind janet yellen but still ok ;)
@_date: 2018-04-21 08:12:45
one week = 3 months in bitcoin time
@_date: 2018-04-27 15:58:34
Jihad Wu (Co CEO of Bitmain) needed an alternative because with SegWit they cant use AsicBoost anymore (covertly). So he and Ver came together and started Bcash.
@_date: 2018-04-09 09:02:27
and he blocked the scam Bitcoin account from Roger.
@_date: 2018-04-11 15:54:53
now Cobra and some other sockpuppets have to tell us why this is vaporware again ;)

Where do you store the "lost" Bitcoins at the moment?

@_date: 2018-04-30 14:40:23

@_date: 2018-04-07 18:18:47

finally i made a successful LN transactions! 
@_date: 2018-04-26 07:37:04

@_date: 2018-04-08 09:07:34
god damnit ....u see, early days.
@_date: 2018-04-25 07:08:07
there is alot of tax fraud and insider trading he was doing in the past but hard to find evidence for that in public. ("Insider trading is a non-crime" Ver)
he is also a convicted felon when we travled to japan and got his visa. to get a visa in japan, you have to declare that you are a criminal. maybe someone can check that too.
all in all, Roger has his morons to do the dirty stuff (astroturf, bribing, insider trading etc) for him.

but more important is, that you educate yourself about bitcoin. you dont have to be a coder, but at least have a good understanding of it.

Retired US Congressman Ron Paul — a bitcoin skeptic turned proponent — reiterated his calls to abolish the Federal Reserve shortly after it raised the baseline interest rate a quarter of a percentage point, to a range of 2.25% to 2.5%.
This is the fourth time that the Fed — the central banking system of the United States — raised interest rates in 2018. The move sparked renewed fears of a US recession that could potentially trigger a global recession in 2019.
Ron Paul said the Federal Reserve should let the free market dictate interest rates instead of artificially manipulating them.
Paul: ‘The Fed Distorts the Economy’
“The Fed has NO IDEA what rates should be,” Paul tweeted. “The Fed manipulates prices, distorts the economy, and makes decisions by looking at the ‘data’ of a distorted economy.”
    Central planning produces a world of economic delusions. America needs to get back to reality. End The Fed!

    End The Fed! pic.twitter.com/achfl4uIQ8
    — Ron Paul ( December 19, 2018
This is not the first time that Ron Paul — the father of current US Senator Rand Paul — has called to abolish the Federal Reserve.
As CCN reported in October 2018, Ron Paul trashed the Fed for manipulating interest rates, saying such artificial machinations could actually cause a recession. This, in turn, could bring about the death of fiat currency, he said.
“It is likely that the next Fed-created recession will come sooner rather than later,” Paul said. “This could be the major catastrophe that leads to the end of fiat currency.”
Paul said the only way to avoid a Fed-created recession is to let people use alternative currencies like bitcoin and to exempt cryptocurrencies from taxes.
    Ex-Bitcoin Skeptic Ron Paul Says Crypto Could Prevent Recession 
    — CCN ( October 31, 2018
Paul said central banks constantly increase and decrease the money supply to control the economy by manipulating interest rates.
He said the Federal Reserve‘s cyclical manipulation of interest rates creates an artificial cycle of economic booms and busts.
    This can create an illusion of prosperity. Eventually, reality catches up to the Federal Reserve-created fantasies.
    When that happens, there is a recession or worse, leading the Fed to start the whole boom-and-bust cycle over again.
Like many in the crypto community, Ron Paul is a libertarian who opposes government intervention in the free market. The virtual currency community generally prefers the crypto ecosystem’s decentralized and unregulated market.
Paul said an economy that is not manipulated is better for society. “Not only should we audit the Federal Reserve, we should get rid of it!” he said.
Former Crypto Skeptic Now Embraces Bitcoin
Until very recently, Ron Paul was a staunch advocate of the gold standard who was critical of bitcoin, as CCN reported.
“Bitcoin is very exciting…but [bitcoin investors] don’t have a long-term perspective,” Paul said in December 2017. “What’s it going to be like in 10 years? Nobody knows. But we have a pretty good idea of where gold will be, in a general sense.”
Paul has since changed his outlook on crypto, and now says he believes that bitcoin and a gold-backed currency can co-exist in a free society.

no. this will not be the case.
bitcoin will be in the six figures and you still can buy your shitty macbook for 2k.
that is because bitcoin is limited in supply but there is an endless stream of fiat money in the world.
take a look what happens, when a stock never does a split:
i know it sounds crazy to you, but bitcoin is the biggest invention since the internet. the best thing you can do is to learn more about bitcoin NOW. go home, read about it.

Please downvote bitcoin,com spam! 
This website ist owned by the former politician Roger Ver (people call him "Bitcoin Judas"). He is expanding his influence with this and is attacking bitcoin since years. He even wants to install a Bitcoin CEO and tries to centralize the development of bitcoin. In upvoting this crap, you are helping Roger Ver with his plans to form Bitcoin in a centralized Shitcoin and hurting your own investment in a free bitcoin. Roger Ver sold most of his bitcoins and now holds large amounts of Bcash which he tries to pump.
His website buys old reddit accounts to post this spam.
Bought accounts:
Keep bitcoin strong and decentralized, downvote this malicious spam :-) !
