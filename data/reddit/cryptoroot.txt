Technically bitmain is losing money since they don't pay the fees to their pool participants..

This won't age well... $7k is literally seconds or minutes in bitcoin... What really matters is 1btc is always 1btc..

Maybe 10 coz 1 to 9 should be tx fee or else no incentive for miners

And you are just a nocoiner getting FOMO'ed
@_date: 2019-09-07 21:18:27
No wonder this post has no mention of mining..

You'll laugh no different than a classic nocoiner!

What proof moron? Yes btc uses much energy even if it is unsustainable... Get used to it or keep crying like a girl! 
@_date: 2018-07-16 14:09:43
The energy required to mine bitcoin is what defines the price or else its just another inflationary fiat currency
@_date: 2018-07-16 09:14:27
70s you are referring is when gold was illegal in the US right? And you need 10yrs LMAO i.e more than the lifespan of bitcoin to prove your point? 
@_date: 2018-07-16 14:06:35
That is my twitter post moron... That is the design of bitcoin first 20 million coins take 15 to 16 years to mine and last one million takes 124 to 126 years.. Your 10 year time frame fits the bill perfectly to be in last million... Cheers!

                                                    Am worried too about bitcoin mining energy only when it crosses gold mining and money printing energy combined as shown in the above status
