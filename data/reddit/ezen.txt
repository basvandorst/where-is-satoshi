Seems like if I could convert fiat to bitcoin with zero fees instantly that would be, actually, the absolute best thing to happen to bitcoin since its inception with relation to empowering people to conduct trade as they please.
Right now the 1% coinbase takes (as well as a week turnaround) is completely ridiculous to the average consumer. Why pay an extra 1% and wait a week when they can use fiat or credit cards to buy it right this second?

Not traditional ones, no, but it has fundamentals by a rounder definition. These are the things that are fundamental to price and you can look at something being undervalued or overvalued dependent on those things.
Many people would say Bitcoin is undervalued due to potential use (growth), community sentiment (non-traders) and merchant adoption stats.
Price action from traders is causing sentiment and adoption to not really be factored in as much as it should. I'd say it's a bit undervalued based on that basic look but traders absolutely run the show right now and I'm almost always holding fiat rather than BTC these days because of it.

Once again, they don't need bitcoin for any of that. Look, P2P for Netflix may work and it may not. That is **entirely separate** from bitcoin being used to compensate them. You pay Netflix with regular money via a subscription. They would simply credit your account on their end so that you owe less.
Zero need for bitcoin in this transaction. It only makes it worse, actually.

This is true but I'm just playing the game. You need credit in order to get good rates for lines of credit, to buy a house, etc. You get none of that with bitcoin and it's necessary.

Think of this like you're trying to teach your Mom how to do it. That first response isn't good because it doesn't explain how they got the bitcoins in the first place.
The second answer is closer but most people don't have a safe and a safe deposit box relies on both banks and the FDIC to insure. It's not an end game solution for Bitcoin to say that you have to buy a safe or use the same banks and insurance schemes that bitcoin tries to replace.

In fact, a proper Bitcoin advocate would be getting paid in Bitcoin which includes plenty of BTC accumulation from a year ago to now. Dollar cost averaging would put their net worth FAR FAR less than if they had used USD, GBP or EUR the entire time.

The Bitcoin protocol functions in a given way. That's fine. However, once you bring that into the real world, it's regulated. It *can* function as intended but once you start trying to use it in the real world you run into regulations. You're absolutely delusional if you think it's not.
You can think you're smart going through foreign companies for brokers or exchanges. You can think you're smart using tumblers or alt coins to launder it one way or another. You'd be delusional if you think that your activity isn't tracked, at the very least, at the source and the destination.
You withdraw tons of cash and do everything via LBC and it'll be flagged no problem. You do it via card or wire transfer and it's still tracked. Maybe you get a bunch by mining and there's no source paper trail. OK, now you'll see tons of purchases like cars and vacations without your bank account being utilized.
The IRS will collect its taxes and the SEC will regulate the crazy derivatives and securities that various exchanges are creating.

Tracking the person isn't exactly easy when they're just being sent from one address to another. It might not even be possible. However, once they start being used for anything with an address they've got their person.
If they get withdrawn via coinbase (or similar service) they would be able to track the source to the coinbase destination address authorities would simply subpoena coinbase for the user's information tied to that wallet. They should have *everything* they need at that point.
Say they use it at Gyft to get a bunch of giftcards. Those cards need to be sent to somebody either at a physical address or an email. Once again, they'd have a real person's identity tied to it.

I have $1000 and I'd like to buy bitcoin at $500/BTC. I now have 2BTC, right? No. I have 1.98BTC due to Coinbase charging a 1% fee.
Maybe I'd like to go exchange some BTC for LTC on a reputable exchange like Bitfinex. I need to send my 1.98BTC to that exchange. When it gets there I have 1.98BTC, right? No. I now have 1.9799BTC in the exchange assuming default 0.0001BTC transaction fee (which is rather unsustainable I might add).
Now that I'm already in the cryptocurrency I'll bet I can switch between LTC or other cryptocurrencies at will and for free, right? No. That'll be 0.2% per transaction. If I went in and out once that's 1.97198832BTC left.
Screw it, I need to pay some heating and cooling bills on my house and they don't accept BTC. Better transfer it back to Coinbase (1.97188832) and then back to my bank (~$975 deposited).

Large ISPs like Comcast, AT&amp;T, Time Warner and others don't actually have a bandwidth problem caused by anything consumers haven't already paid for and then some. In fact, state and federal money totaling in the Billions has already been given to them to build infrastructure like Google Fiber is now doing.
The difference is that these guys are in an oligopoly and have lobbied their way to a nice cushy spot where they take our money and do nothing with it.
The problem has everything to do with how these guys have carved up areas of the country so that they don't have to compete on prices. Furthermore, their oligopoly means that they are actively making sure their prices are around the same and that they collectively fuck us over.
The only thing to defeat this is competition and breaking down the laws that these ISPs have set up to insulate themselves.
Lastly, on the topic of bitcoin, it relies entirely on ISPs. If you're a fan of bitcoin, you need to support initiatives from local governments to run their own fiber and/or Google Fiber itself to show the ISPs your desires. Also, make sure you vote for people who will vote for net neutrality.

They all rely on ISPs, though. Bittorrent is P2P downloading but only in client to client. It's not actually P2P. It's Peer-to-ISP-to-Peer if not going through multiple ISPs.
Even going to a distributed model the ISPs will easily shape the traffic of clients on the distributed network. This is what happens with bittorrent but can only be avoided by using things like Tor or VPNs. This can't really be done with a hosted service like Netflix.
To be honest, I'm surprised that Google Fiber doesn't just launch an all out assault on the most lucrative locations for these big ISPs, lay their own fiber and then price the competition out of existence.
Or, we could actually go after the ISPs for stealing billions of dollars and then not building the infrastructure that was promised.

Guys, guys, guys ..... no one is gonna give a shit. Until the first audits actually hit someone, are successful and are public - nobody is going to calculate this shit.
FIFO is so ridiculous it will never be calculated. If you bought 0.05BTC back when @ $10 and then another 0.05BTC at $20 and you're now buying something for 0.1BTC at $50 equivalent - people aren't going to figure out the math on the tax they should pay on the higher gain of the first 0.05BTC vs the second 0.05BTC.
Start using real world examples of pulling multiple small quantities of 0.012748BTC + 0.035515BTC + 0.03432BTC from different wallets left over from different times who knows which exact BTC was bought at what time...
If this can't be EASILY figured out by the person owning them holding the private keys it'll not be figured out by the IRS. The IRS audits people when they have more to gain by auditing than it costs to audit. Doing these kinds of investigations isn't free. Unless you're a whale, you won't get auditing over the BTC.

Me too. Have you seen how to maintain one of these things, by the way? Shops the specialize in them say they can remove the entire drive train in about 30 minutes. It would take half a day to remove the entire drive train of even a simple car, if not more. To put it all back or replace an engine, another day.
Those hours add up to thousands in repair costs. Tesla cars being so easy to repair and change engines (one moving part) mean it's far cheaper as the number of cars increase.
Also, it means you could swap parts of a car like those new modular phones. They could conceivably sell bodies of their new Model X (crossover) without engines and you do the swap and sell the body back.
Pretty exciting. Hopefully the Model X does well so that they can fund the Model E at about $30k.

Correct. I'm mostly a lurker of this whole thing because I'm curious to see the psychology behind the decisions made. These cards are cool and technologically very interest; also, completely impractical to compete with a regular credit card.
I'm not putting it down so much as wondering where you go from this thing to something a true average consumer could use.
@_date: 2014-04-11 02:58:50
It's temporary. Once these businesses start accepting bitcoin they should then buy their supplies not with fiat but with bitcoin they received. That business then does the same and on and on it goes.
Some will always want to withdraw straight to cash which is just as bad for a bank as it is for bitcoin. If I had a business that accepted bitcoin I'd only convert to fiat if I couldn't use it to buy what I needed.
@_date: 2014-05-21 13:42:34
Track them. Eventually they have to be converted to fiat or otherwise spent for the person(s) who stole them to get anything out of it.

I can't help but feel that when people share this information it's not actually doing anything. This is stuff that agents for the FBI would be doing if there was some kind of oversight or investigation into bitcoin fraud.

Ever watch Pawn Stars? They can buy a piece of jewelry because gold and silver are their bread and butter. However, if the police come in because that jewelry was confirmed stolen they take it from the pawn shop and that's it. End of story.
It's the same thing here. The person screwed is left holding the bag.

Yes, do you not understand what's happening to BTC? You're being taken over by currency traders hardcore. I hope people here travel to to see where your volatility is coming from.
@_date: 2014-03-03 15:04:35
The fact that it has value is faith that it has worth. Currency trading itself is based on the economies of the world and what's happening there. The value of the USD is linked to the US economy so it does have more than just blind faith.
Bitcoin's value is in its features only.

That's a good simple starting point. Can you do the same with these questions?
1. How do I use the money (GBP, USD, EURO) I have now and start using bitcoin for goods and services?
2. How do I secure my money?
@_date: 2014-10-28 17:07:33
I didn't say it wasn't functioning as it was intended to. What I said is the reality of using it: it's regulated.

Are you guys planning to buy your own country with Bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-03-23 12:51:18
Why did you just buy the BTC at 1% fee to then buy a car with it when you could have just bought a car with that fiat? You're severely limited the number of people who will sell a car to you.
I realize what subreddit I'm in but if you buy a shit car you'll be spending a few more BTC to repair the thing.

I don't have the expertise to debate whether plants can perceive their surroundings or if it's all just response on a cellular level. I suspect it's the latter but I don't know.
@_date: 2014-03-03 20:05:24
True. So it's both, yes. But, once again, that's not "backed by nothing" as people keep talking about in these forums. Bitcoin is backed by truly nothing but the value people place on it with no guarantees or fallback plans.
@_date: 2014-05-01 13:45:20
This is the correct response.

I guess I shouldn't be surprised. Thailand is one of the most true free market economies out there. Much more so than UK/US. Brazil, though much of the world ignores their progress because it's not the US and Western Europe, are a powerhouse unto themselves.

Why would you want your faith restored in this person? It's like politicians who are corrupt. They keep coming back and people keep voting for them. At best, he's an incompetent CEO that lost $600,000,000 in users' funds.
There's no reason to support him or otherwise want your faith restored. There are 7 billion people on this planet - pick another person to have faith in.

@_date: 2014-03-05 22:11:10
Did I say 100%? All those things are still controlled, affect by and otherwise influenced by entities. Currency is currently traded like crazy and the big banks and firms that trade it absolutely have a lot of control. Cryptocurrency in a free market is actually easier due to lack of regulation.

Respectfully, I disagree on almost all counts. The major markets that exist are the US, China/Japan, and England/Germany/Switzerland. Regulations around bitcoin (in one form or another) are already in each of these countries to some degree. No country is just going to say "Go wild!!!" and no one should expect them to.
Bitcoin is not a zero sum game. The protocol can (and most likely will) happily coexist with nation-backed fiat for its entire existence. People living with fiat can now send money internationally with less fees than before. That's not zero sum - it's win-win.


I have no idea what you're trying to say here.
@_date: 2014-11-03 14:25:28

Hmm, never heard that before.

No, that's still easy to track. You know the coinbase address and you know the address they're sent to. Very easy to track.

Have you ever tried to explain how the internet or email works to somebody over 40 years old? Try explaining internet currency that was mined from numbers and is stored in a cryptowallet on their Yahoo toolbar-infested computers they got from Best Buy for $250.
This subreddit doesn't seem to understand that they don't represent average users in the least.
@_date: 2013-12-22 21:23:43
They still need to understand what it is. The average person isn't particularly intelligent when it comes to brand new internet services, ideas and certainly not currencies. How is grandma gonna know what to do?
And, frankly, it's the grandma's of the world that you need to convince. Most young people are switching to Google Wallet or Amazon Payments. People trust Amazon and you can send up to $1000 absolutely and completely free even using a credit card.

The volatility of currencies is precisely why the US Dollar is so valuable. People think it holds its value well so they keep it around. If they didn't think that anymore then it wouldn't be worth nearly as much as it currently is.
The same is true with bitcoin except changing opinions there is orders of magnitude easier. The average person has no reason to use bitcoin when they could have $10k in the bank today and $5k in the bank tomorrow and certainly not when the vast majority of places and people don't accept it.
I lurk he mostly but I had to comment on this. You guys are a bit of a circlejerk sometimes. Bitcoin has lots of uses but its volatility is a CRUCIAL factor among many others.
Look at the guy who lost 2.8 BTC because his brother deleted something off his hard drive. It doesn't take much to lose thousands of dollars. Store it in the cloud? Now you're trusting the same companies working with the government.
Then there's the simple fact that there's a finite number of bitcoins. Or how about the fact that it's a "mined from nothing" currency. These have answers and likely you all understand them better than a lurker like me. But if these things can be explained in a way that makes the average company want to deal in them, the currency will eventually fail and many will be left with nothing.
