Yeah, I have gathered some info about one of them, the guy who called me on discord.
It's probably a russian group.

Is there nothing I can do about? I have the dude on discord.
@_date: 2019-09-25 05:31:21
That's a clear signal of scam, right?
@_date: 2019-09-25 05:59:40
Thanks for your words man. I hope I've learned.

Hi Lidsi8, thanks for sharing with us!
I've gathered a lot of information about this guy, maybe who talked to you is from his group.
@_date: 2019-09-25 05:37:56


Why not? I have all the conversation saved on discord.
@_date: 2019-09-25 06:24:16
He sent me a telegram group where he makes all the things happen 
  
check it out!

Man, for my conditions, that's a lot of money. Don't forget, I'm not in a developed country.
@_date: 2019-09-25 06:22:00
I wont do it man, I'm justing trying to find someone who knows how to track him, if it's possible.

Well, if somebody want to help me to recover my money? I've just published a game on Steam. It's pretty fun and costs only 6 dolars.
here's the link [

Yeah, you're smarter than me.
@_date: 2019-09-25 05:53:56
The guy on discord just admited he's a fraud!! And now he's trying to recruit me!! Man, there must be something to do about it!!
@_date: 2019-09-25 05:46:58
Nobody think it's possible to make something considering the data I have about the guy?
@_date: 2019-09-25 05:56:36
How are you so sure? Where are hackers these times? :'(
