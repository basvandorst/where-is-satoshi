Not really, because the orderbooks are bigger than the current price. If he buys all the 11.000$ BTC, next he has to buy all the 12.000$ and so on. If he would try to buy everything, the price would be beyond you imagination.

Point is: Bitcoin is a currency, not an investment vehicle. 
This post is directed to the mainstream tards and merchants. Maybe, just maybe, they get it now.

It has never been supposed to be a store of value. It is and stays a P2P electronic cash system. You're supposed to buy or mine it and then use it (meaning exchanging btc for goods and services), you're not supposed to hodl it.

@_date: 2018-08-14 16:51:05
You're missing the point.. We talked about BTC as a store of value.
Saving is not a use of money. You save money in order to buy something later on in life, or to cover unexpected expenses. 
Saving in itself doesn't do anything. Saving USD doesn't make it worth more suddenly, as you try to imply with BTC saying it is a store of value.
Saving BTC doesn't increase the value of it. It is the real world usage that gives it value.

Yes, for a few days. After that? Can it be volatile again or does it still need to stay flat? There has to be some kind of volatility. Green percentages get the attention we need, with that comes red percentages. Nobody is going to put money into something that does basically nothing.
@_date: 2019-11-04 11:19:17
I put 33% in, now it is about 75% of my total wealth, and I'm not taking anything out. 
I wish I had put this much in at the time I first heard of Bitcoin (2 years into my study). Then I'd had a few million bucks. Remember the usual 4 year cycle of Bitcoin. We're halfway (summer 2020) of the current cycle. Plenty of things to come for Bitcoin.

Our worldwide electricity net isn't even ready for electric cars anyway.. The whole ecosystem needs to change, before we can go full-electric. 
"Moreover, charging these cars requires much more electricity than we currently produce, which in turn results in an increased strain on the electricity infrastructure, especially at ‘peak hours’."
So, it is a pretty dumb excuse to be anti-crypto because of the amount of electricity it uses.
Whenever the industry and powerplants start to be more efficient, then we can compare energy consumptions. Let's hope THEY get forced to be more energy efficient at once.. Because THAT is where the most gains are.
@_date: 2019-11-03 13:17:05
But what about the gains!? 
On a serious note, volatility is good. It displaces value, as it is supposed to do. Value shouldn't be hoarded and be concentrated at one place. Value has to flow, otherwise there is no economy.

Would be great, if it was an actual open-source project. 
Legally, the developer of the system has complete copyright. That is why every open-source software comes with a license.. Imagine what would happen with that smart contract if there would be a dispute, like the Linux CoC story. The company can at any time withdraw the license and forbid anyone else to use the smart contract... As we all know companies and greed go hand in hand. This is a realistic scenario, which we want to avoid.
We need individuals developing open-source software, not companies.

Bruh, since 2015.. But another surge is bad according to you? A flat line means decrease in value. If Bitcoin would stay at a flat line, then Bitcoin would decrease in value, because FIAT decreases in value due to inflation.

Not necessarily. However: 1. As a corporation you must comply with government regulations, even the silly regulations. 2. OMG can at any time include code to indeed make their DEX a non-DEX, but that would probably be such a huge scandal that it would be their downfall. It is very unlikely, but possible. 
There was a serious bug in Bitcoin not so long ago that existed for years already. Everyone assumed someone else already sifted through and verified the code, resulting in nobody realizing there was a problem. Let's hope the community learned from that.

Good to hear! What software did you use?
@_date: 2018-10-09 19:39:27
I'm not able to visualize what you mean. You mean a LN copy on top of RSK? 
LN is a transaction network. What would happen with user-data that the ICO projects gather? For example a social media project on top of RSK. Posting an image would upload the image + format/html data + a transaction to a blockchain (if I'm not mistaken). My guess is that the transaction accounts for the least amount of data here.
RSK chain would still grow to an unmanageable size.. Unless you store the data of that social media project off-chain. Which I see a a possible option too, if done properly ofcourse.

"... they are still working on addressing the scalability issues of the platform."
To make the Bitcoin economics actually work, we need to distribute data efficiently. In the long run, a blockchain gets of unmanageable size, if we continue to centralize blockchain projects (read: different projects using the same (side-)chain). 
To make this work, we need to decentralize projects. Meaning each project should use it's own side-chain. Blockchain sizes are kept to a minimum, this way we don't need to download data we don't use. 
For example, why should I download CryptoKitties data if I don't use/support the project? If they had their own side-chain, the users could download and share the data with other users, while the Ethereum blockchain itself would be of a lesser size.

Let's dive deeper down the rabbit hole.. On their FAQ page you'll see "Are you hiring?". We can assume that only corporations hire people.. No Bitcoin developer is being hired by the Bitcoin project. Anyway, let's dig even deeper. The contact e-mail ends with "omise.co". Go to that website. 
OMG is controlled by a well hidden corporation, Omise. I consider OMG, because of the fact that they don't even mention their company on the regular pages of the website, more dangerous then Binance. At least Binance is honest about them being a corporation..
I'd rather go with DDEX or EtherDelta. However, sadly they aren't very efficient yet.

The only price manipulation was because of the media and government. 
Before they got interested in BTC, it was steadily growing. A nice not to steep line upward. The upward trend was pretty stable if you looked at it from a distance.
Media pumped it into a bubble. And government dumped it with their regulation announcements.

If Bitcoin itself is able to function with side-chains, why would you want a third party between Bitcoin and your side-chain? 
I'm not explicitly against it, but your suggestion is pretty pointless. That third party between Bitcoin and your side-chain will function exactly like a bank or payment processor, which is unnecessary and highly unwanted if you ask me.

No, centralized banks do not protect against scams. 
You need to file a civil procedure in order to try to get your money back. Civil judge will make a decision. Even after that, it is not sure whether or not the criminal pays you back. With the civil order, you can however pay a debt collector to take it from the criminal.

I also still have a student debt. But it can wait. The only thing I pay, is the monthly payment, which I try to keep as low as possible. 
Why I don't pay off the loan as quick as possible? 
The rate is 0.12%. If I can make even 1% profit with the money I have, it is a win situation. Yea, I lose 0.12% because of the debt that I have, but under the line I am 0.88% up (if my money is equal to my debt).
If I had paid off my debt, I wouldn't have any money left. Bitcoin gave me enough gains to pay off my debt 2x.. 
You can't quit now. Bigger parties have made preparations to support Bitcoin, miners start mining like hell again, the market has just climbed up a bit.

Then why are newcomers relevant for the design of the logo? 
Alright, I understand that they still see the Bitcoin logo and it'll make them want to look into Bitcoin. But then they still can't pay because they still don't know about LN. 
So I think it is better to just mention lightning network or lightning payments. That way they instantly know about both and that they are connected. 
Even better, when we're thinking of newcomers, is to include a QR code that opens a webpage with instructions on how to buy Bitcoin and use LN to pay.

No, institutional investors got an option to not buy BTC and instead let everything settle in USD. And that is what the article is about. Bakkt isn't forcing anyone to buy BTC, hardly anybody does.

@_date: 2019-12-21 15:38:24
Okay, it is indeed much more than just a currency. The store of value is based upon speculation right now, but the true value of Bitcoin comes from its use cases. The store of value thing is more like a self fulfilling prophecy. It is a store of value because people think it is.
But I think telling people who really need that power back that Bitcoin is some fancy hard-to-grasp store of value investment vehicle is a bad idea. 
You know how the general public (not us, but "the mainstream people") views banks that invest in stocks? They lose money. If the word investment (or anything linked to it) is heard, it is instantly linked to danger and potentially losing all of your money. The fact that investments can also bring high gains, doesn't matter to them, because there still is a risk attached to it and most don't want to take that risk. That's why they keep their hands away from Bitcoin.
It is much better to market Bitcoin as an easy alternative to PayPal or Apple Pay. Also since it is essentially just that. It's a lot easier for the general public to understand and use if you market it like it is a currency. 
But it depends on who you'd like to buy Bitcoin. Are you targeting people with investment knowledge or people without that knowledge? Anyway, this discussion is going to take to much of my time. Just know that the right communication to the right targets is needed. Good luck!
@_date: 2019-12-16 20:59:24
Not directly. But they do facilitate clearing in FIAT. It doesn't help people to actually own Bitcoin. People usually choose the easiest option, which is FIAT. Bakkt could help educate people on Bitcoin and how to deal with it, but instead Bakkt chooses to give people the easy FIAT option.

But fact is, they don't buy BTC.. That's the whole point. 
It's not "eventually", they offer it right now. 18 BTC settled in the past months. Hardly any institution is interested in physical BTC. Institutions making you rich is a wet dream, nothing else.
You get rich by actual adoption. Accumulation happens always, even when the price is $100.000 or more. When is the time right? Would you still be happy if the price kept dropping for the next 50 years, because we have 50 years more time to accumulate?
Institutional investors should be pointed to real exchanges if you'd really want any gains. Futures are nothing but a financial weapon of mass destruction.

All depends on if and where they buy real BTC.


Ohh I get you. As long as the cash settled futures stay just introductory and eventually disappear, it might turn out good for BTC. But it probably won't disappear..


Alright, yes. Indeed it doesn't matter if BTC increases 1x or 10x in the near future. As long as BTC continues to appreciate, instead of showing more frequent downward trends.

Read past the fingerpointing. Analyze the facts.
Futures are a WOMD to growth. It is meant the slow growth and stabilize assets. It allows you to be profitable at a downward trend, that's how it stabilizes the price. 
All these so called Bitcoin futures did, was bringing the price down.
At this stage, Bitcoin isn't ready for that.

Clearly manipulation. For weeks we've seen a flat line, then out of nowhere a huge drop, and then it continues flat like nothing happened. There were no corrections like with a natural market. And that happened twice in such a short time!
To the ones that say "btc up, no manipulation, btc down manipulation": BTC went up gradually all since 2016. We never saw upward spikes followed by flat line. We saw corrections, both downward and upward. This is natural. Price dump or spike followed by flat line is unnatural.

Since 2015 the market went up because of tech advancements. (Good old times when people believed in the tech, instead of lambo's..) Since October/November 2017 positive hype pumped BTC up to near 20k. So, you make no sense at all.. The price did go up because of positive hype.
From the moment BTC reached near 20k, governments couldn't keep their filthy hands out of this anymore and started crackdowns and FUD campaigns. Bitcoin exists 9 years now, they never cared, but since it reached 20k suddenly it is a thing and needs to be taxed? They're just greedy parasites. The same time the market plunged. How can a person not see this?

Not really.. Technically you're right. But miners now earn 12,5 × price, 2020 they earn 6,25 × price. Since miners still have expenses to pay, they calculate expenses = 12,5 × price × profit. If profit and expenses stay the same, and 12,5 halves, then for the formula to work the price needs to double.

If you got in at $450 and now it's ~$4300 how did you sell at a loss? Average buy price higher then your sell price? If the average buy price is above the average sell price, then you made a loss.
Always buy at a stable flatline or a dip.  If you're buying at an upward trend, then better sell short-term before the price falls again.
Anyway, it's generally a good practice to never put in more than you can afford to lose. And, if you have a decent profit, to get out what you put in and play around with the remaining profits.

You got your money back from their insurance. Where did the insurance get their money from? You.. You pay for using your mastercard. All that happened is that you got part of the money back that you paid them earlier.
Financial institutions are professional scammers. That's how they make money. Loans: they sell you $1000 for $1100 and you simply agree to that. Insurance: They sell you (fake) "safety" and when you make a claim they do everything they can to pay out as little as possible, often even nothing.

I'm sorry for your loss, RIP. One advice my friend. 
If you bought BTC as an investment, then never sell for a loss. Investments require long term vision, no real investment gives short term results. If you're in it for the investment, and you're serious about it, then be prepared to HODL and accumulate at least 2 years.

I have never heard of any broker that does offer you actual papers and allows you to buy with BTC instead of dollars. 
Again, best chances are to trade person-to-person. However, I would be pretty interested in such parties too.
@_date: 2018-12-09 16:33:52
Sorry for not writing a complete wiki guide up there, captain obvious.. ;)
There had been articles on hacked hardware wallets. If it's not open-hardware, it's not safe. Would you trust Bitcoin if it was not open-source and run by a company? At least I would not..
@_date: 2018-12-16 17:53:04
What do you mean? I thought you were looking to buy stocks using BTC. Best practice is to buy person-to-person.
@_date: 2018-12-09 08:09:43
- Install a full node on you laptop or pc.
- Run the software.
- Encrypt your wallet with a strong password. 
- Close the software. 
- Search for "wallet.dat" and copy it to a backup location (preferably an offline device such as usb).
Congrats! Now you have your own wallet/private keys. Look up your address and send your coins there.
@_date: 2018-12-17 20:37:47
Bitmex down, then Bitcoin (and crypto in general) jumps up. This is no coincidence anymore. 
@_date: 2019-05-15 17:29:33
Yea, ofcourse its not free.. Why not charge an additional fee for each trade, but make the software free?
@_date: 2018-12-08 12:19:58
Why would you even love that? Why not love buying at 10k to see the price go up to 1M? Are you sick or what? Why would anyone want a decrease in value? I don't understand..
@_date: 2018-12-08 12:28:27
You don't buy capitalism.. So your argument is invalid. You don't have to understand how Bitcoin works to buy one.
My point is: Capitalism is dynamic. Flow of money, in and out. That is what results in the market having a certain value. Hodling is static, thus nothing will happen by just hodling. So if you hodl because you fomo, you hodl with the intent to get rich, which won't ever happen, because there is no dynamic if everyone hodls. 
@_date: 2018-12-09 10:07:41
Very interesting. If that's true and it happens to Wall Street, than that may be a major wakeup call. Let's hope for the best and do everything we can to empower individuals.

Not me, I was there since 2013. But this is how the general public sees this. "Buy Bitcoin" is nothing more than a greed fueled marketing slogan. "Participate in Bitcoin" or something along those lines would be a lot better for Bitcoin adoption. 
@_date: 2018-12-15 08:02:52
Aww.. 10 years!? C'mon, I can't wait 10 years...

Full nodes are the backbone of Bitcoin. Without full nodes, there is no Bitcoin. 
The purpose for keeping the blocksize limit, was so that people could run their own full node and make the network even stronger. 
@_date: 2018-12-09 15:50:03
It is not as black and white.. As with everything in life.
Ofcourse the main reason is to validate for yourself. He did state it supports the network a little bit, which is actually more than a little bit.
Remember the Bitcoin/BitcoinCash drama? And UASF? Full nodes are the ones that can keep the miners in check. Full nodes are validating the work that miners do. Full nodes reject the false blocks produced by malicious miners and only accept the real blocks. Full nodes enforce network consensus. 
 &lt;- contains very important information about why full nodes are important for the network 
@_date: 2018-12-08 06:29:08
Futures are not a thing to celebrate. They destroy Bitcoin. Why doesn't people see the obvious effects!? 
@_date: 2018-12-09 07:35:36
Exactly. 
However, I don't think we can "just hard fork away". It'll be a full scale hard fork war (if they start mining themselves), which has to be ended by another UASF. Difference with previous is also that they have mainstream media on their side.
We'll have to educate people on what Bitcoin really is and indeed to hold their own private keys.
@_date: 2018-12-09 18:06:02
My rejection IS part of the network. What do you mean? What did my rejection do?
@_date: 2018-12-09 19:02:26
EOS is gambling and gaming platform!? Nobody mentioned that! I'm selling, I'm out..
@_date: 2018-12-09 18:14:15
I really don't see where you want to go..
You tell me I can just legitimately have a balance of -1 BTC? That there are no consequences to it?
If my node accepts it and all other nodes reject it, my node falls off the network, continuing on its own chain (if there is even a continuation of the chain). But that wasn't the question. 
Which is why it is important to run a full node yourself. If 8 out of 10 nodes are run by a malicious party, they can kick the 2 legitimate nodes out.

Because BTC is the true economy. FIAT is a scam. That's why in the end not just shitcoins but everything trades against BTC.

I don't even use Reddit as a source of my information. *face-palm* Seriously. Or was it general advice to note that people shouldn't just trust you? In that case, yes doing own research is important. 
Anyway, I checked and indeed they are even open-hardware. Thanks.
@_date: 2018-12-08 06:35:55
You shouldn't measure everything from its ATH.. It's unhealthy thinking. Bitcoin increased 4x in that "bear market", $250 to $1000. That part was just the start of one awesome bullrun all the way to Dec 2017.
@_date: 2018-12-31 12:31:00

We should focus on making Bitcoin the best and most decentralized cryptocurrency.

If you buy paper gold with dollar, and the gold price goes up, then you can sell your paper gold again and get dollars, yes. However this has nothing to do with BTC.. And this is what BTC is supposed to destroy. 
Etoro and other brokers work with debt. If you buy paper gold, you don't own the paper gold yourself. Brokers and other Wall Street parties lend the same paper gold to more then one person. If everyone at once would sell their paper gold, some people would not get their dollars.
But if you buy stocks from person-to-person, you actually own the papers yourself because these papers can't be lent out to others.

Welding robots didn't completely wipe out professional welders.. And these welding robots need maintenance, programming, etc.. Professional welders can make themselves useful in more ways than just welding..
Everything that destroys jobs, creates new jobs. Also Bitcoin will create new jobs. If you're worried about losing your job to technical advancement, you shouldn't try to destroy technology, but instead learn new skills that can be used in combination with the new technology. 
And like you said, the financial industry is very inefficient. They let it happen themselves. Due to their laziness, they have a really nasty competitor. 
Every industry has these problems. If you as fossil fuel company would invest in alternative energy, than the company doesn't have to go out of business. 
@_date: 2018-12-09 09:29:27
What, why... XD Thanks for your quick guide.
I need to buy hardware and download software from a fairly untrusted party. Then set up the software (just like setting up Bitcoin Core). Then writing down a set of words that can recover the wallet file and store these words (just like storing the wallet.dat itself) somewhere safe.
It sounds to me it is really the very same process, but just less safe. Why not just backup the wallet.dat instead of words? Seriously, how hard can it be to copy your wallet.dat to an external harddrive or usb? Oh wait, Bitcoin Core doesn't walk people through those steps.. Seems like I found something to contribute to Bitcoin!

Everything someone hasn't seen before is complicated. Math in the first grade is complicated, until you learn and eventually understand. 
We shouldn't just feed newbies things from a silver platter. It's very bad for the general understanding of what Bitcoin really is.

Blocks can still be produced after all coins have been mined. Only then any new block won't contain an extra amount of Bitcoin but just the transactions + fees.

"Buy Bitcoin" is a joke. Haha, yea buying something that crashes in value that quickly. Great advice, mate. Haha, desperately need to sell yours?

As if any real person buys Bitcoin just because he/she read it on some random persons back..
@_date: 2018-12-08 06:41:12
The money that could go to support actual Bitcoin goes into these valueless side bets. 
They (financial sector) are smart. They do everything they can to pull money away from Bitcoin. If there is no money to flow into Bitcoin, it won't ever increase in value. No increase in value means Bitcoin isn't interested and is useless to very many people, resulting in even less money flowing into Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-12-09 08:17:01
Costs probably more than 2 ASIC's. But it's nice.
@_date: 2018-12-09 08:36:43
Are they really easy and safe? I don't have any experience with hardware wallets. 
Also, I don't trust them that much.. Do they generate safe keys? Hardware encrypted SSD's weren't as safe as one thought. Stories about companies owning masterkeys to unlock all their made SSD's and backdoors in the firmware used to decrypt encrypted SSD's..
Anyway, are hardware wallets plug'n'play? As in, I connect it to my computer and open Bitcoin Core and there my balance is..? Isn't there any sort of set up needed?
@_date: 2018-12-09 11:50:12
I know the point of it, but thanks for the more detailed explanation. I can see the security in having a setup like that. 
Have any examples of malware that can steal form an encrypted wallet.dat?
I'd rather use Linux software encryption than use hardware SSD encryption. But preferably both at the same time.
Are any of these hardware wallets "open-hardware"? So that anyone can verify that these devices are safely built using safe components, and are having safe firmware on them?

Yea, who cares about legitimate documentation that comes with the things you use? You know everything a lot better than the producers of that documentation because you had an early prototype. 
I ran a full node since early 2012.. They don't only validate their own transactions, they validate all transactions that happen on the network. 
Like I said, it keeps miners and everyone else honest. Why do you think you should wait for enough confirmations to consider transactions valid? Who are confirming transactions?
