Check out deepdotweb, they have a huge list of Bitcoin only marketplaces you can use.

I did this course, it is honestly terrible in terms of quality and marking.  
  
It is participation only, so as long as you attempt the work you will pass, the biggest problem is the low quality content.

He did not really conspire to launder, but with so little requirements on such a site, it was bound to happen, maybe he was actually ignorant to this?

Madewithcode - seems like a good idea, but is really sexist?

Governments can pump in unlimited fiat if they wish, but they will drive up the price making all hodlers wealthier, triggering the greatest wealth transfer in history. 
The more they put in, the more we all gain.

Looks like it confirmed 10 minutes after your post.
@_date: 2015-08-15 15:36:52
My bad.

Forget him, protect your coins.

BTC has added technology which dilutes your control of your own money, BCC has centralised mining, neither adheres to the original Bitcoin philosophy.

That is typically an off the chain fiat transaction. 
@_date: 2017-09-03 16:23:22
It can't be avoided, but we should try to keep hubs of discussion focused on the technology, and less so today's price.

People piling in based on the get rich quick hype.

You need to limit voting, I can vote multiple times by refreshing the page, I was quickly able to move banks from friendly to unfriendly.

Look at this sub, it is filled with price memes, and investment posts, it certainly looks like a speculation bubble compared to the technical discussion and anti-banking ideals the early community focused on. 
While I think Bitcoin will become increasingly valuable in the future due to real transaction adoption, this current buy and HODL speculation is taking away from the core values Bitcoin was built on.

I think growth based on scarcity and transaction volume growth  would be potentially less volatile. 
@_date: 2017-09-03 15:00:57
I would like to agree with you, but realistically a larger proportion of the price based growth is being driven by speculation. 
I doubt most investors have ever made a Bitcoin transaction.  
@_date: 2017-09-03 12:52:08
The volatility sucks when you actually try to transact in Bitcoin on a daily basis. 
@_date: 2018-07-08 06:36:04
So this is more just marketing hype...
Big companies do not accept Bitcoin because very few people use it to actually transact. 
@_date: 2018-07-07 23:43:07
Do you know how many people are actually paying by Bitcoin as a % of your bookings? 
@_date: 2015-09-17 12:03:56
Are you looking for help getting set up, or looking for help customers?  
  
If you are looking for customers a location would help.
@_date: 2015-09-17 12:23:46
If you have an online checkout, I would intergrate it as a payment option, and add a small bitcoin logo on your home page in your footer, showing you accept the currency.

Bitcoin could never be used to fund a war because it has a hard limit to limit the number of coins that can be produced.  
  
A country will not enter a war unless it knows it can sustain the effort long term through debt financing.

I am unable to unfollow this account, odd. 
@_date: 2019-05-09 00:43:16
Tell them it's a fixed supply currency, not an investment.
@_date: 2019-05-09 00:41:49
I doubt anyone that just stole $41 million USD in Bitcoin needs to do any shorting.
