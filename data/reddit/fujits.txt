Pardon if this is speculative but, is Darkcoin having any effect on Bitcoin? It seems that the huge rise that Bitcoin had in the last few days correlates to the recent rise of Darkcoin. You can trade between Bitcoin and Darkcoin on certain exchanges.

in the beginning how did bitcoin obtain value?  did people buy it with fiat money?  Is that true with new crypto-currencies on the market? Does the marketcap of a crypto-currency reflect how much fiat money it was traded for?

ok, thanks I understand the marketcap now.  Another moronic question, when those two pizzas were bought, did that create a price for one bitcoin? or was it still how much people were willing to pay for one bitcoin at the time those pizzas were purchased, or was there no set price for one bitcoin at that time?

what is preventing someone on the exchange buying coins back and forth raising the price? Wouldn't it be possible for a few people to keep buying coins back and forth and manipulating the price?

thanks for answering. another question. theoretically what would happen if someone were to start buying bitcoin at $1000 right now when the price is at 580?, how would that affect the bitcoin ecosystem?  How many of those coins would have to be bought at $1000 to actually affect the price?

Why are there no proper bitcoin exchanges in the US?
