I read Satoshi’s white paper in 2010 and took a look at the source code. As a developer myself I thought to myself “Wow that’s a genius idea!” I started trying to get my computer’s GPU to start mining that day and tinkered with it for a few hours. After a few hours of messing with Linux graphics drivers I stopped because I had “real work to do.” That decision ended up costing me millions looking at the price today, but as I’ve gotten older I’ve taken a lot of stock in one of Richard Branson’s quotes:
“Business opportunities are like buses, there’s always another one coming around the corner.”
If anything I’ve taught my future self to trust my gut with things I know a lot about. Onward and upward. Keep your eyes open, there’s other opportunities all around you. Don’t regret the past so much that it keeps you from a better future.
EDIT: The quote is actually "Business opportunities are like buses, there’s always another one coming." My brain added the "around the corner" to the end, and I didn't look it up to verify prior to posting.

Lol I think you’re right. The details feel fuzzy and I probably tinkered more than once back then. Wait, I looked it up and GPU mining took off in late 2010 and CPU mining took off earlier that year after a Slashdot post. (
I was somewhere in this timeline, but I forget exactly where.
I remember having issues with the Bitcoin client (wouldn’t mine for some reason) and I think it might have been due to all the Compiz Fusion stuff I was messing with at the time? It was probably a really simple PEBKAC that I didn’t take the time to really figure out.

Right. The thing I don’t think will play well with LN is the whole fund a channel thing. That is not how normal people expect to pay. It’s like having to buy a gift card with each merchant and then use that to transact at the counter. You tie up funds in the channel. You may not know exactly how much to fund beforehand. Not to mention you need an on chain transaction with fees to fund it in the first place. It is against expected consumer behavior and might be a tough sell.
Now if BCH pulls off the recent “weak blocks” proposal you can get near instant confirms with everything on chain. That solution looks more promising to me IMHO.

Um no. bitcoind had a Linux install as early as December 2009. It wasn't necessarily easy to get working, but it did exist for Linux

I hear you. I've now been spending most days learning and thinking about dApps on Ethereum and other things that can be disruptive when layered on top of crypto. It's a fascinating concept and has taken me longer than I care to admit to get my mind around. However, I think distributed apps will be the next major opportunity in crypto and present the greatest opportunity.
@_date: 2017-12-05 17:35:33
It doesn't mean that there will be another Bitcoin coming around the corner but there are always business opportunities available. The longer I've been in business the more I've seen how true this is.

Yes but not as a primary form of transacting. The funded channel adds extra stress to a transaction that should be seamless in my opinion.
@_date: 2014-07-25 21:00:33
As it is currently designed the blockchain is a record of every transaction that has ever occurred with Bitcoin. It is not just a verification of amounts owned.

Also contrary to popular opinion the Wild West had a very low homicide rate. Much lower than today,  0.6 - 0.9 per 100,000 people between 1868 and 1890. Today the rate is 4.7.

It acts as a debit card and I don't think it can be overdrawn. They authenticate the amount of USD based on Coinbase's exchange rate at that moment. I think it works in the same way where if you buy something with Bitcoin on say Overstock you have a 10 minute window that the BTC amount is valid for the purchase.
@_date: 2014-10-11 07:18:28
I hear ya. If Bitcoin is taxed as a commodity then we also have to deal with stupid rules like FIFO and then what if some of your coins were mined vs purchased. The whole thing is an absolute nightmare.
That being said I'm happy to blaze the trail and hopefully figure things out for others later.
@_date: 2014-01-10 22:17:32
Most MOTO transactions are probably going to clock in around 2.9% and 20 cents or so. For someone as big as Overstock I would probably venture to guess that they have a rate around 2% and $0.20 for Visa/Mastercard. AMEX and Discover will typically be much higher. The extra $0.20 per transaction adds up quickly and depending on your average ticket size can eat up a significant amount of processing.
For instance, if average order size is $20 and they have a deal for 2% and $0.20 then the actual CC fee for that order is $0.60 which comes out to 3%.
Now, what most merchants don't realize is that their processing banks will usually quote a low rate 1.9% or something, but the fine print says that the rate can be variable due to volume, average order size, etc.  When many merchants look at their actual statement they usually find that the first $100 of the month got the 2% rate and the other $9,000 were charged a 3.95% rate. Many of the advertisements you see are for "teaser" rates that can be changed by the processors at will.
I'm sure that Overstock has negotiated much better terms than what I described above, but these types of practices are systemic within merchant account processing and happen to more businesses than you realize.

I count myself lucky to have received one of the beta cards recently. It is attached to my Coinbase account and debits BTC with each purchase.
I'm excited but I have a sinking suspicion that this may be the most expensive fast food purchase of my life.
@_date: 2014-07-25 18:01:09
I've long thought this is the next evolution. Technically, all that is needed by the blockchain is the most recent hash as it is a hash of all the others preceding it. I could imagine the Bitcoin devs implementing a new protocol that has the network agreeing on a hash every month/week/whatever and then all that is necessary to run a "full" node is the most recent batch of transactions. The blockchain is still written to and remembered by classic full nodes for archival.
As the blockchain grows exponentially, something like this will most likely have to occur to help decentralize the network.

Yes but until merchant acceptance increases these cards give Bitcoin even more utility. You can start doing things like taking more of your salary in Bitcoin because you will be able to pay things like utility bills with these cards.
IMO these cards are a necessary hybrid before BTC acceptance becomes mainstream worldwide. Its kind of like how hybrid cars fill a gap until more cars go all electric.

I'll try to find the statistic and report back. I'm not currently at a computer and scanning academic papers on my phone is a bit clunky.

Except I don't think there are currently any fees to use the exchange BTC =&gt; GHS and the reverse. Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong, but I've traded GHS with CEX and I don't think I've ever encountered a fee.

Agreed, but sometimes it just tastes sooo good. I usually regret the decision later though.
@_date: 2014-01-10 23:36:26
Yes, there are fees everywhere.
The article you mention is incredibly vague and rates as low as what they are talking about only exist for merchants where the card is present at the point of sale. Internet, mail order, telephone order merchants have much higher rates to account for fraud concerns.
Also, like I said before the rates being talked about are what is called a "qualified" rate. If any transaction is deemed "non qualified" it gets subject to a very different rate scheme. Transactions can be deemed "non qual" for many many reasons and most merchants aren't aware that it's even occurring.

Agreed, homicide rate in the "Wild West" from 1868 to 1890 was 0.6 - 0.9 per 100,000. The US homicide rate is about 4.7 now.

Name me one piece of that video that is misinformation. It is exactly how currency is created in the US:
1. Congress creates bonds through the Treasury.
2. Said bonds are sold to banks.
3. Banks liquidate bonds to the Federal Reserve.
4. Banks use money given to them by the Fed to pay the Treasury
5. Treasury moves the currency to government branch accounts.
6. Income tax is used as collateral against this debt to pay interest to the Fed.
7. As currency flows to banks, fractional reserve banking kicks in and exponential amounts of currency are created.
@_date: 2014-10-11 02:32:56
I'd say that about sums it up.
@_date: 2014-10-11 07:27:57
Agreed. I'm hoping that at some point it is looked at differently for tax purposes because it's practically impossible to even figure out how to follow the law correctly as it currently stands. The nice thing about a massively decentralized system is that it simply routes around censorship and stupid regulation. I think the IRS will soon come to find that enforceability is near impossible and will change their approach but we'll have to wait and see.
@_date: 2014-08-13 02:53:50
There are several articles and academic studies on the subject. To start you off, I found this article informative: 
@_date: 2014-10-11 03:29:25
Sure. It currently looks like this:
The backend is super simple, and I haven't seen my purchase post yet. Coinbase hasn't updated either that any BTC left my account. I wonder if it will post once Del Taco clears their batch on their terminal?

Sorry you are wrong. I am a developer and have looked through the source code. The blockchain is absolutely a database of every transaction ever made in BTC.

Just to be clear, are you calling Mike Hearn or Satoshi the troll? If it's me you're labeling an "obvious" troll, don't you think Satoshi's post is relevant to the debate at hand concerning Bitcoin scalability?
@_date: 2017-03-21 20:34:57
Bitcoin is not Ethereum and is not designed to have more than one chain past a difficulty increase. Because of the time between difficulty adjustments in the Bitcoin protocol the minority chain always died off, something that doesn’t happen with Ethereum because Ethereum adjusts the difficulty every block.
Letting Ethereum Classic survive was easy. There where no programmers needed, nobody needed to do anything.
If you want to let a fork of Bitcoin survive with a minority of the hash power, you will need to make a lot of adjustments to the protocol.

This statement logically says that Core actually has the power now.


Here you state the community has it, not Core.

Anything you own before the fork is valid after it. No coins will be "lost". The only transactions in question will be the ones that are spent during the fork itself. It will be interesting to see what the exchanges like Coinbase decide to do during the transition phase.
The real question is what happens to the value of Bitcoin as a hard fork? Does it signal weakness to the outside world or resiliency and strength? Bitcoin has hard forked before and probably will again in the future. I personally believe that a hard fork would show resiliency but there are many who would disagree with me. 
What happens to the price is anyone's guess. My personal forecast is that price will decline during the period when the fork first occurs but would gain quickly after the following difficulty adjustment. But any number of other scenarios could occur.
As a programmer, I'm just in awe at the protocol that Satoshi first setup. I read his white paper in 2010 and went through the source code and thought "wow that's brilliant". I just wish I would have given myself one more hour to get my GPU mining that day. Of course I had "real work" to do and forgot about till a couple years later. :P
@_date: 2017-03-20 02:43:31
Sure. There was a fork in August of 2010 to fix an integer overflow bug that was exploited. There was also a fork in March of 2013 described by Gavin Andresen with BIP 50
“A block that had a larger number of total transaction inputs than previously seen was mined and broadcasted. Bitcoin 0.8 nodes were able to handle this, but some pre-0.8 Bitcoin nodes rejected it, causing an unexpected fork of the blockchain. The pre-0.8-incompatible chain (from here on, the 0.8 chain) at that point had around 60% of the mining hash power ensuring the split did not automatically resolve (as would have occurred if the pre-0.8 chain outpaced the 0.8 chain in total work, forcing 0.8 nodes to reorganise to the pre-0.8 chain).”
Forks happen all the time actually, but built into the underlying Bitcoin protocol is a way to resolve them. This is the part of Bitcoin I was so impressed with early on. Building a decentralized anything is really freaking hard particularly when you need to resolve "split brain" situations. 
Basically if there ever is a fork, the one with the greatest mining hash power behind it wins. This makes it insanely difficult for someone to do something nefarious because they have to overcome the billions of dollars worth of hash power on the planet. In the early days of Bitcoin this was worried about a lot. Some people thought the US government would just spin up a ton of machines and overtake the currency. In fact, they could have. Now though? I'm not so sure.
There's some more info on forks here if you're interested.  
@_date: 2017-03-20 01:15:21
No. The BU miners are currently only mining small blocks (1MB). They are simply signalling that they would support BU when they have the majority hash rate. Technically they could pull off the switch to big blocks at 51% but that isn't reasonable. They will most likely wait until it seems that they have 70%+ and then a miner will mine a block larger than 1MB.
At that point only other BU nodes/miners would validate the big block but all the Core nodes/miners would reject it. At that point, we would have a fork in the chain. The way Bitcoin works is that once there is a fork, the chain that is the longest after a period of time wins and it becomes the definitive block chain. Basically once this happens it becomes a bit of an arms race. If BU has 70%+ of the hash rate then Core will have until the next difficulty adjustment to make their chain the longest. However it would be highly unlikely that the minority chain could keep up. It would be a bit of a death spiral.
What happens to all the BTC you own? Nothing really, the only part that becomes murky is coins that are spent during the fork. Because the longest chain that wins will be Bitcoin, all the transactions to the beginning of time are forever embedded in the ledger. 
EDIT: the little comma that could
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:10:19


Here's the thing, BCH isn't some "other coin." It is a fork of Bitcoin itself where they changed the 1MB limit to 8MB. There's an interesting difficulty adjustment coming tomorrow, but it's basically the same. All those wallets/POS terminals/etc can easily switch to BCH because it's basically exactly the same as Core (minus Segwit). Super easy to switch from a programmatic perspective.


I agree with you but the Core devs have decided to deem it as a store of value system (aka gold) and not a payment system. Intentional or not, this was the effect of refusing to raise the block size limit thus limiting the network to ~3 transactions per second. With a saturated mempool and fees on the rise, Bitcoin has become pretty awful as a payment system.

It's even more centralization than the chart shows because the vast majority of local bank acquisitions aren't even represented. For instance, I still have the first bank account I ever opened when I first got a job. I opened it with a bank called Coast Federal. Which was acquired by Home Savings of America, which was acquired by Washington Mutual, which was acquired by Chase.
