Dude 3 BTC bitcoin was nothing before in comparison to what it is now. A lot of people got an opportunity to buy it at a discount as well back in December and everybody panic sold and it was an opportunity, it went up almost 450% from last year lows.

Yes, that's how we do it. Congratulations! Welcome aboard on the Cryptowagon lol. It is so easy to accept cryptocurrency nowadays with  API Key, and it is incredible how this option is available to future E-Commerce owners. I have a marketing agency in SF Bay Area, and one of our services is Website creations. Our attention for cryptocurrency grew back in 2018, and now we are helping small &amp; mid businesses to accept it as a form of payment on their online stores. One of our recent work is also running on Shopify, which is a Women's Clothing Store: [ In our view, we feel that giving more options to the customer is good, and even if you say Coinbase is not trustworthy, we found the opposite. Anyways, we recommend using [OpenNode]( (It is very straight forward as you say), [Coinbase Commerce]( [CoinPayments.Net]( &amp;[BitPay]( If you are looking to accept TRX, BAT, BNB, or any other Altcoins CoinPayments is very good at that.
