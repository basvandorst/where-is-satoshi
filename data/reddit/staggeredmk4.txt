This is absolute TRUTH!

Yes I'm sure, i used it for a quick withdrawal at Christmas time. Maybe their site is over loaded like usual so they sign-up is down right now? 
The fees are a little more expensive but I was able to withdraw $500 to my PayPal account that literally only took 5 minutes to show up and then about 10 minutes to deposit into my bank from PayPal. 
It's definitely convenient. Only reason I'm still using Conbase.

Blockchain.info. 
Enter in your wallet address. 
Look down page at transactions. 
Hover mouse over green button on right that shows btc amount. It will show you fiat calls at time of trade. �� 
@_date: 2018-01-06 06:13:37
Copy and paste much? 
@_date: 2018-01-02 06:17:40
While this is true, you have to transfer USD(or whatever fiat you use) into Coinbase initially which can take up to 10 days to clear(ACH bank xfer). If your trying to buy right away because of low cost them you'd need to do a ACH BUY. This purchase can still take up to 10 days to post to your Coinbase account however it will be the amount of bitcoin you purchased at the price it was exactly when you clicked BUY. 
You do want to xfer your BTC to GDAX to move to your personal wallet though for zero xfer fees. Coinbase charges for the same xfer. 
Hope that helps some
@_date: 2018-01-06 18:12:38
If you KNOW what you are doing them why didn't you send for free through GDAX??

Research the different hard and cold storage wallets and choose what works best for you. It's not a good idea to leave your crypto on an exchange though. You don't really own your crypto if you don't own your private keys.

Also use GDAX to move your crypto to your external wallet instead of Coinbase. GDAX transfers are free. 
@_date: 2018-01-02 03:34:56
Incorrect. They still accept it but only for items they directly sell/ship. There are a lot of third party suppliers that sell though Newegg. They DON'T accept bitcoin. 
So if you have multiple items in your cart and even just one that's through a third party then bitcoin will be grayed out as payment type. 
@_date: 2018-01-07 17:12:09
Conbase now allows BTC to PayPal which can be added to Apple Pay
EDIT: they allow all the cryptos they support to PayPal

Bank ACH are never available instantly. Not sure where you saw that. 3 weeks is ridiculous however. It should be within 10 days. The systems are backed up though. Have you talked to your bank at all about it? 
Have you withdrawn before to this bank successfully? 
Do you have all of your ID verification submitted and approved properly?

The back wheel is locked to the frame. You'd have to carry the bike off to steal it. Granted that's is certainly possible however is a large bike so would be difficult. My wife has a cargo bike called a Bakfiets which is a very large heavy bike. It has a built in rear wheel lock simply because it's too heavy and bulky to try to carry away. ��

Takes 9 days for me. If you just buy with your ach bank payment rather than deposit into USD wallet then you lock in on the current price when you click buy. It still takes about about a week to fully post to your Coinbase account but are least you bought at the price you wanted.

Log into Coinbase and look up the transaction in accounts there. It will give more information like addresses and such that you can input into blockchain.info. GDAX only gives you their trx ID number which means means squat to a user.

Buy a girlfriend, sounds like you need the attention. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:58:16
On your phone app, click Accounts at the bottom. Then click BTC wallet. 
There will be a list of any transactions you've done. 
If it's pending it will habe a little yellow dot and say pending. If you click that transaction it will show you the details of how much btc, how much you spent, the price of btc when you purchased, date of purchase, account you used to order. 
It can take 7-9 days to post to your account from that purchase date. 
Your email confirmation of the purchase should have the expected post date as well. ��

You can't be angry at the "pending" transaction. That's how it works there if you buy through ACH transfer. You DID get the rate at the time you bought so no biggie there. 
As far as the extra transaction, did you get a email confirmation on the 2nd transaction? 
Coinbase support is horrible but ultimately everything goes through eventually.

I believe that bitcoin is and will be far more valuable than gold but gold does have numerous uses. You forget its most common use, jewelry. If the value of gold dropped to zero, it still has real world uses. If bitcoin dropped to zero what can you do with it. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 21:50:21
If a credit card payment had been made on Coinbase then you should have a confirmation email stating so. If you don't then you should contact your CC company to dispute whatever charge you say went through buy you have nothing to show for. 
It's no different than if you bought something online with your CC and didn't receive goods for it, you'd dispute the charges correct?

All of this I already know well. I was simply stating that if both go to zero value, gold still has uses if you own it, bitcoin does not. 
With that said, I am well invested in bitcoin, the only gold we own is the jewelry my wife wears(which also was a good investment) �� 
@_date: 2017-12-28 03:49:57
I absolutely will HODL all the way to zero if it ever came to that. I'm in this long term. On top of what I mined in the early days I'm investing only what I can afford to lose. I make a good living so a total loss wouldn't affect me. You are not going to be drinking any of my tears unless they are tears of joy ��

@_date: 2017-12-17 23:24:43
While logged into Coinbase, open a new tab on your browser, go to GDAX.com, click sign in. It should automatically log you in. They are one in the same account. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:16:03
If you bought with bank ach then you got locked in at that price when you clicked BUY.
If you just did a ACH deposit to your USD fiat wallet on Coinbase then you'll have to wait to do anything. 
I don't mind paying the bank and credit card fees on Coinbase because in the long run I'll make that money back. Is rather pay those fees than lose out on a current price. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 08:21:19
Not on GDAX. You can only trade with fiat, btc, eth, or ltc right now. 
You can use credit card and or bank ACH on Coinbase for immediate purchase however with ACH you can't do anything with the purchased crypto until it has cleared the bank, about 7-9 days

@_date: 2017-12-08 05:41:16
This is only good advice if your planning on trying to play the market. 
If you're looking to make this a long term investment then but whenever you have the spare money to invest regardless of the current price. 
I bought more today at $16,800  and I could care less that it's before that right now. 
HODL and enjoy the ride. It's a hell of a roller coaster ride. �� 
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:39:09
Use GDAX if sending to another wallet.

This is likely the case. It'll show up. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:47:07
At least you bought back in! �� 
@_date: 2017-12-29 00:10:25
Well seeing as how I don't believe it will ever totally fail it would not be in my best interest to sell even if it dropped to $1.00. I believe it would recover so no use in selling. Call it stupid if you'd like but it was stupid when everyone sold at the first crash in the early days. Do you think they were stupid for selling when it crashed and now it's in the tens of thousands?? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:15:20
I buy whenever I can over time. I bought at $19,500 a week ago and still happy I did �� 
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:07:04
I missed the lower dip earlier but just bought more at $14,500. Also bought on the 16th at $19,500 because I HODL �� 
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:59:27
I have a 10 year plan overall. Not planning on touching it until then unless it quadruples before the 10 year mark then I'll sell enough to cover what our initial buy in was to replenish the savings we invested. We are already near that point. 
I will also continue to buy in every paycheck like we've been doing. �� 
@_date: 2017-12-16 22:48:18
This is smart. Put that money into something else that can make profits. Simply converting to fiat will likely lose you money in the long run.

@_date: 2017-12-17 08:14:29
I'm not sure about withdrawals to a credit card. The fees for buying with a credit card stress certainly higher than direct ACH bank transfer or wire transfer. With that said though, I still use my credit card as those fees are easily covered by the potential gains in the rising value of BTC. 
I HODL so I can't answer any of your questions about withdrawls.

Tell that to our County Commissioners! 
@_date: 2019-03-22 15:03:03
I hear what you are saying however that is not the case here. 
Montana is the 5th largest producer of energy(combination of all forms) and the 3rd least densely populated. 2/3 of the energy produced in Montana is exported to other states and Canada.
This is why electricity is so cheap here. That combined with the cool climate makes it a perfect location for a mining facility.
Northwest Energy is fully regulated by FERC(Federal Regulatory Energy Commission) therefore they cannot simply raise prices to customers.
This is a witch hunt on a company who is currently buying clean hydropower and has done everything by the book. They apparently even spent over a hundred grand replacing cooling fans with quieter ones because of complaints of noise around the community. This facility is on a old lumber mill site that is zoned industrial with NO sound regulations at all. They wanted to be good neighbors though and took care of the problem.
I am a tech guy and it disgusts me to see the state i've grown up in pushing away new technology and jobs especially considering it's part of their economic development plan to lure tech companies here.
@_date: 2019-03-22 19:07:45
ABSOLUTELY CORRECT! If they were using 20MW and creating beer, they would be praising their use of hydroelectric power. 
They see high energy usage, minimal job creation, and they can't physically touch, see, smell, or taste a bitcoin. 
@_date: 2019-03-22 15:11:25
If it were more affordable to initially invest in sure.
You can't say it's free though because it's simply not. 
Solar and Wind are great ideas if we could ever find a way to store that energy.
The problem is they only produce part time. Montana isn't even very efficient for these options because of the mountainous terrain which limit wind and sun. Not to mention that they are currently running at 20 MW which would take a minimum of 100 acres of solar panels.
Again, I believe that solar and wind are amazing ideas but until we can develop methods of storing energy they are simply supplementary energy sources.
Again, how can you fault a company who is actively purchasing green power?? 
@_date: 2019-03-22 03:54:51
Well said. It would be greatly appreciated if you could post this as a public comment on our county's website regarding interim zoning they are getting ready to enact on April 4th. There are so many people in the community including the county commissioners that could use a good read like yours.

I hodl yet I also spend to help spread the word to hopefully help adoption growth. 
I keep a spending wallet on my phone that I keep a balance of BTC on. I use it to tip people or make purchases with daily. I try to replenish it with newly purchased BTC at least once a week to maintain my spending balance of BTC. 
I think it's helpful to encourage adoption by spending some and simply purchasing that what you've spent. I mean you were going to spend fiat to tip your waiter/waitress anyways. Why not tip them on BTC and then use that first to replenish the by you just used? Sure, volatility may cause you to spend a few extra dollars or it may gain you a few extra dollars but if you do it consistently over time it all averages out just like DCA. 
We can have it both ways! ��

@_date: 2017-11-30 04:13:08
How did you pay? Credit card should be almost instant however  they are swamped busy so it's possible they are taking longer to post. if you paid through a direct bank ACH then it usually takes 9 days to post to your account. Don't worry though, you were locked in at the price that you clicked buy at which should show on your pending transaction. 
Edit: Don't even bother with support. You'll only get more frustrated. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:56:44
Same here
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:45:29
Did you buy with bank transfer or cc? Back transfers take up to 9 days to post on Coinbase however it should show the transaction. My first CC transaction was cancelled by my bank. I got an email from Coinbase telling me this. Had to let the bank know it was a legit transaction then run it though again. 
@_date: 2019-02-22 19:28:24
If your in it long term it only matters how much BTC you have, not how much Fiat you spent. 
I buy some every paycheck. Daily cost averaging. I bought at $19,500. But I also bought all the dips and highs along the way. 
It's a Helluva ride but if you believe long term, it's probably worth it. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:39:33
I've heard Gemini is good. I personally use Coinbase/GDAX and it's a LOVE /HATE relationship but Coinbase issues a really simple interface that is easy to use. The fees are around 4% for credit card purchases and 1. something% for direct bank transfers. Bank transfers can take up to 9 days to go through however you are locked in at the coin value when you click buy. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 05:30:39
You should still be locked in at the price it was when you placed order. That's how it works with my ACH direct bank deposits. It takes 5-9 days to hit my crypto account but the price was locked in when I clicked buy. 
@_date: 2019-06-10 03:43:37

@_date: 2017-11-26 16:36:39
You do not have to buy a whole bitcoin. I wish everyone understood this. You can buy $20 worth if that's all you can afford. I'd recommend at least buying what you can to get your foot in the door and then invest a little more each paycheck. I recently started selling stuff I don't really use/need any longer and am investing that money. 
It's really easy to get into bitcoin, you just gotta the that first step and get your foot in the door. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 07:30:49
On Coinbase if you buy using a direct ACH bank payment the you are actually buying that the rate at the time you click buy. This transaction takes about 9 days to post to your account but it will be valued at the rate at which you first bought it. 
On GDAX you have to have actual a fiat currency balance in order to buy. That's because you are directly making instant transactions with other individuals rather than through Coinbase which is basically a 3rd party if that makes sense. That's why GDAX has super low to zero transaction fees, they aren't having to front any $$ while the bank transfers take place. 
@_date: 2019-06-24 00:17:53

The fees suck but honestly those fees are probably going to cost you less now than the amount you'll lose by buying in at a higher price later while waiting for deposits to clear. 
I've heard lots of stories of direct transfers (bank ACH and Wire x-fers) to GDAX taking weeks sometimes to post to your account. 
When btc dipped to $8000 on the 20th I did a buy in Coinbase through ACH bank payment. It takes about 9 days to post to Coinbase however it locked me in at that $8000 price. Downfall was the fees however that's already been made up with the big climb that btc has made this week so it worked out fine in my case. 
Be careful about canceling the transfer as I've also heard that can take a long time to get BACK to your account also. 
I'm sure Coinbase is swamped right now with the crazy amount of new sign ups going on right now but they seriously need to fix their support system.

Just a heads up but there have been people with HUGE delays in money posting to GDAX. I had a client who direct wired $20,000 from his bank which GDAX claims is available same day if done before a certain time. It's been 2 weeks and the money is still in limbo. Not in his bank and not able to use it to buy. Their support is horrible. With all that said, it's still who I use with good results.

The only problem here is that it takes 4-9 days for a ACH bank transfer to actually post to GDAX. 
Make sure if you go this route to understand that money is not usable until it posts. Now if you make a bank purchase on Coinbase you get to buy at that set price right then even though it takes 9 days for the transaction to post. This is useful if there is a big dip and you can't wait for USD to post to GDAX however there are fees on Coinbase whereas none to deposit in GDAX.

Whenever I use to tip or buy with, I turn around and purchase that amount of BTC back as to keep my BTC balance up and growing. Yes, it costs me a little extra in the fees to buy back but it's worth it to help spread the word, educate, and promote adoption.

Missoula county in Montana just passed zoning that requires any new or existing crypto expansion to create or buy NEW(previously unavailable) renewable energy. 
Hyperblock, the only mining facility in the county, has been buying hydroelectric power for 2 years and has contractually obligated to purchase their expansion power already from the same dam. 
The county commissioners are claiming that cryptocurrency is "displacing" others from that renewable energy. 
Basically they're an established mining company that has always purchased green power and has agreed to buy hydro into the future but they are being singled out by commissioners who are against Bitcoin. Under the new zoning rules Hyperblock's expansion is expected to not only buy the power they have already contacted for the expansion but have to buy it again or build their own to offset the energy usage. 
Even when mining companies are trying to do the environmentally correct thing they are being persecuted in an attempt to run them out of town. 
I love seeing all of the positive aspects of Bitcoin mining for energy usage but the powers that be will always try to stifle it's progress.

This is the eventual plan anyways but trying to buy quickly during this dip would be immediate through my account it wait for verification on her account setup.

We are thinking LONG term, as in a useable currency, not cashing out into fiat.

Are you posting this because YOU have a issue with the power usage or because of the bad press bitcoin receives over it?

Please give mine to someone else in need! I love that you are doing this though! Pay it forward. If everyone did the world would be a much better place. Thanks for doing your part! ��

I agree with another about too much fancy editing. Not a bad video at all but a little overkill especially since you wanted it to be an informative video. The special effects editing makes it hard to keep up with reading the informative text. Not being a dick, just giving feedback �� 
Any reason behind using NH vs another pool? 
Thanks.

Source? This doesn't sound correct at all? I understand getting taxed on gains made but why should it be taxed just for movement? 
@_date: 2018-02-18 22:35:17
Thanks, I use NH as well before and after the hack. I just like to hear others opinions on NH ��

Dec. 16th 1:28 pm I purchased at $19,510.60 which in my opinion is still going to be a steal in the future. I buy every paycheck regardless of the price. I buy extra if possible at the dips. 
I'm in this long term! 
@_date: 2018-02-12 05:53:25
Correct me if I'm wrong but no taxes are due until the exchange into fiat, exchange into another crypto, or purchase of goods with it correct?

That was my first thought too seeing ETH and LTC watching from up above. They came down with.

We avalon way to go before miners can get along bitmain point to take away is that it is possible. Maybe they can meet up innoscillicon valley to hash it out?

Cool idea but I can't hardly educate someone on Bitcoin in 3 hours, what kind of real education can be given in 30 seconds?

If 1 BTC hits $1,000,000 you won't have to convert to fiat.

This last paragraph is underrated!!! 
Always test restoring your wallet with a small amount on it before sending everything to it. You should fully understand the proven the entire process before trusting it with all of your funds.

Please explain why Bitcoin was worth $750 3 years ago but it's worth $8000+ today? The value doesn't go up simply because people only "heard" about it.

I bought at $19,580, and 3200, and 5700, and 4850, and 12,400, and 4900, and 9100, and 2870, and.....and, well you get the picture.

What I just learned today is that in the US it's apparently whoever files a Copyright claim on it. If multiple people file the same claim it is up to the original filer(CSW in this case) to dispute everyone else who may file it. 
Again, it's not like Craig can do anything with this Copyright but it does add his name in official history books as being the person to Copyright the Whitepaper. It would be great to see hundreds or thousands of other Copyright claimants of the same Whitepaper which would somewhat invalidate his entry IMO.

I still have a wallet used for tipping and purchasing using BTC. I simply buy back what I've spent the same or next day. Using it as a currency on top of HODLing helps promote and educate people on adoption which is needed in the long game.

You will continue to see additional fees until we have a much higher adoption rate. I don't necessarily agree with it but those who provide a service did have the right to be compensated for that service.

If you can still access the Electrum wallet containing your Bitcoin then you should still be able to view your seed. Bottom right hand corner looks like a little sex with a leaf growing out of it.

You mean those things that the US dollar(or any fiat) has been contributing to since inception?
