Every time I see posts like this, my paranoia / thinking that it's a fake site trying to some how steal my bitcoin keeps me from clicking on it. 
And that's the case here.  Won't be clicking on your little link because you made some extremely vague comment about bringing down bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:00:05
@_date: 2017-12-05 00:42:45
Why would there be a theoretical maximum with bitcoin being a deflationary currency while being measured against inflationary currencies? 
Maybe my thinking is off, but it seems to me that given those circumstances, it could increase in value relative to fiat forever. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 17:38:29
It'll be worth 12,200 of whatever unit of measurement you're assuming in this scenario.
No idea wtf you're even asking. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 04:29:54
I don't see why I can't use both?  I don't understand you, and all the other bitcoin white knights that act like using fiat is some mortal sin.

No - there's no tax benefit to being paid in bitcoin.  Bitcoin isn't a 401K or Roth IRA, or any other government 'sponsored' savings program where taxes are waived for any reason.

You're an utter moron if you chose to pay $20 in fees and then come hear to bitch about it.  Literally nobody here cares.  We just think you're a moron for paying a $20 transaction fee and you could have paid under $0.20 if you wanted to. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 12:17:47
Why would the surge in pricing be any different for a female than a male?  Or am I missing some other point here?
I just asked my wife how the price surge over the year has made her feel and she said "huh?  Umm, great?" And then stared at me in a weird confused  way as I went back to typing this.  
For the record, as a male, the price surge has also made me feel great.  
@_date: 2017-12-24 13:55:00
I don't see BTC having another big jump until a solution to the scaling issue has been implemented.  The fees and excessively high transaction times are a major problem at the moment.  I'd say it's even over valued at 15,000 and will probably settle closer to 12,000 until a solution is in. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 12:38:09
Ohhh, I see.... yeah, that one went right past me lol
@_date: 2017-12-09 14:07:38
Capitalism keeps them in check.  Basically the market naturally keeps itself in check. If fees get too high, more people will begin mining forcing competition and lower or stabilizing the fees.

Agreed - it's like complete anti-socialism.
I actually vote republican, but my true beliefs are Libertarian.  I only vote republican because I'd rather have a  government that favors capitalism over socialism, and Republicans actually have a shot at winning and holding office.  Unfortunately, a Libertarian president probably won't happen in my life time. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 13:00:57
Absolutely nobody knows. 
If anybody gives you a different answer it will be pure conjecture, so I'm not sure what you're hoping to get out of this.  
Additionally, some version of this question is asked 100 times a day. So don't be surprised if you get a lot of sarcastic answers, or few to no answers at all.

Can take several hours for it to show up.  Just wait and remain calm. It'll show up. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 11:44:24
I haven't used Gemini yet, but if it has stoploss orders, there should be a trading feature labeled either stoploss or just 'stop' along with buy and sell.  That is what you'd be looking for to accomplish this. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 17:56:40
You don't have enough information to be helped unfortunately.  You either need to be with your aunt and have her help you answer these questions, or she needs to research this herself.
@_date: 2017-12-05 17:29:03
Where did she buy them from?  She can most likely sell them where ever she bought them.  If not, she's probably out her ~$100 dollars that's appreciated to around $220,000.

I'm a libertarian.  Bitcoin works so well with the ideology.
The smaller the government the better.  Let me decide what my life is going to be.  I don't need the government's 'help' deciding where my money goes, or what I should be allowed to do.

No.  Pay your taxes.  Not worth exposing yourself to all of the potential problems you could face by trying to scam your way out of it.

It's 99.99% a scam. Who's to say there is any bitcoin at all, let alone the amount they claim are locked.  Either the person can't unlock the device and the scammers never get caught, or the person does and unlocks it to nothing on there and the scammer claims the purchaser must have screwed something up and deleted them.  
If you want to buy into this go for it.  As the old saying goes, "a fool and his money are soon parted."

Not that I know of.  If I ever want to know what my current stash of BTC is worth in fiat tho, I just type whatever the current market price is into a limit sell order, and double click my bitcoin balance as though I'm going to sell it all at the current price.  It'll tell you the amount just below the order form.

What proof does she have that she owns these crypto coins?  Did her friend give her a piece of paper with all of the keys written on it?  Did her friend send them digitally to your aunt?  
There's only one bitcoin, but where they're currently sitting (cold storage, online wallet, on an exchange, etc.) depends on what she needs to do the sell them.

@_date: 2017-12-05 19:35:26
No problem. For what it's worth (not much - see my first comment), I'd buy now if I were you.  Just be advised that the bitcoin market is extremely volatile, so don't get scarred if you buy at $11,800 and it drops to $9,500 within the next couple of weeks. The prices fluctuates constantly, but it's been a pretty steep upward trend over the past year or so now.  So just hold on for dear life if it dips right after you buy expecting it to go up in the long run. 
Not saying that will happen, but it's a possibility and I'd hate for any new comers to get cold feet and lose a bunch of money on a temporary dip when they could just hold their coins through the dip and come out ahead a few weeks later.
