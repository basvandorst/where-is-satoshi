Congratulations. Personally I don't see the draw in using article titles. Much prefer the whitepaper version. In fact when I get my own house I'll probably get a Ethereum whitepaper version done.

Why does everyone seem to want to retire early, or even retire at all? Isn't that just decommissioning yourself to wither away? Not trying to offend anyone who plans on it. I'm just wondering.

I remember two weeks ago when everyone was arguing against those who said bitcoin fees are high by pointing out that the average transaction fee was 10sat/B. How times change.
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:34:16


I wish I listened to my instincts more. When Bitcoin crossed 20 000 I got a bit uneasy and wanted to dump half of it into ETH and divide the rest between Monero and some other alts I'm in. Shook it off and look where the price is now. Just going to wait till it gets to that point again then dump.
@_date: 2017-12-16 01:50:45


Which was a damn mature move by them. Maybe people here can take a page from their book.
@_date: 2017-12-09 02:02:27
Thats the whole point isn't it. You said other cryptos don't have to deal with this problem because they don't have enough volume. Yet here is Ethereum handling the volume pretty well with a different implementation. point was that other coins do it better. Sure Ethereum will also have to make scaling improvements but they've got some time before their network is declared pretty much useless by volume.
@_date: 2017-12-29 03:40:42
This is what I don't understand. If increasing block size is a temporary fix then increase the block size to TEMPORARILY provide a solution to an immediate problem while a permanent solution is in the works. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:09:45
Dude. You're not honestly comparing a charity event to this. Charity donations are financially planned for and you get a tax break from them. That is nothing like spontaneously giving away 1BTC because someone drew you a pretty picture or giving someone 79 BTC because a man you dislike was mean to him. Like I said, she's behaving like a lottery winner and we all know how that goes. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 08:42:49
I was being sarcastic.

Look at the transactions going through. The freeways are empty because no one lives there. 
You seem to be forgetting Ethereum. Burying your head in the sand is not gonna make the tech better. Own up to its flaws otherwise Bitcoin will have no future.

They're doing that so...

It's BEEN coming!
@_date: 2017-12-19 03:31:53
If you read their announcement you'd see that they'll be adding other altcoins, they're just starting with Bitcoin cash. Why? Market cap probably. This is a business decision. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 14:07:42
Here's the problem. They put in a small amount of money to test the waters, are advised to never keep their coins on an exchange, so they move it and badum tsssh...   they meet bitcoin fees or the endless mempool wait.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:21:31
Even with Segwit, the fee is around $10. That's still pretty high. It's an improvement but hardly amazing.

It will happen until it doesn't. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 13:23:07
I've seen fees reflected as x satoshi/byte. Does this follow the normal convention where 1 byte = 8 bits?

No homo is just a running joke. If his admiration was sexual the obligatory "Totally homo" would have been attached. It's a joke because everyone says it even when its definitely homo.

If ever there was a complete wipeout of the crypto market the "better tech" coins would probably rise from the ashes without Bitcoin. Another thing is that people are slowly moving away from Bitcoin trading pairs to ETH trading pairs on exchanges. This further lowers both the utility and the tie in of alts with bitcoin. I'm here for big nuclear explosion of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:05:21
No. You only have to look through this sub and twitter to see everyone was up in arms over what Roger said with hardly any mention of And I'm not saying that you're mudslinging, just that, that had nothing to do with the response from people. You may have donated because of  r/btc but the rest of this sub has decided that Roger is a douche and will do whatever it takes to give him the finger. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 07:37:34
Not only that, he somehow thought it was ok to use a derogatory term to refer to Japanese people.

What if I told you I know exactly what's on the side bar but the person you're arguing with doesn't. You're busy telling him that he lives under a rock and should be ashamed of his current knowledge level. When I tell you to educate him instead, you tell me to read a sidebar I know and not looking to re-read and subsequently calling me ignorant. Do you see yourself? How is that gonna help u/Tommie78749. My initial reply to you is literally pointing out that you seem to have forgotten decorum which I believe is wait for it, rule 1 on your precious sidebar.

I don't know. The Bitcoin Cash fork happened in August 2017. There's a tweet from the CEO of Lightning Labs from December 2015 claiming lightning will be ready within 6 months. That might not be a definite deadline but these people waited for a solution for a year after that date. One can only be so patient.

For the most part its not as bad as it sounds. From their perspective they're stopping me from making stupid monetary decisions driven by being young and reckless. It's hella annoying at times (such as when I want to put my hat in on crypto) but seeing as my older brother is notoriously bad with money, I can see them wanting to prevent a repeat of that. It sucks being treated like a child but its just a year till graduation. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 14:28:05
Ah thanks. That makes sense. It always confused me a bit when seeing amounts reflected as bits and fees as sat/B but the maths not computing like it should. Will read up more on it. (I know transaction size =! bitcoin sent, it just messed with my head).
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:50:03
The point is that Ethereum is processing more transactions per day than Bitcoin but is not getting as crippled as Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:02:25
Glad you didn't fall into that trap.
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:14:21
If you really want to get more I'd wait for when/if the price stabilizes.
@_date: 2017-12-23 04:43:45
Yeah but only 40 billion ripple are currently in circulation and they've already got a decent market cap in. If you want dollar parity (don't know why) then ripple will still do. How much total currency is there in the world (not just dollars)? I think if crypto is supposed to be a world currency we need to compare it with all the money in the world and see how much of it is in crypto and what would it take to get most/all of it in. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:26:35
Is his statement wrong?
@_date: 2017-12-16 01:47:18
Much like how people are using BCash which is a completely different token too? I honestly don't see an issue with the Bitcoin Core or Bitcoin Cash names and find the insistence on calling the other BCash really immature considering everybody expects this industry to be taken seriously. If there's no market for it, it will die, if there is, it will flourish and theres nothing wrong with that. I mean I don't even know why people are upset that BCH users are using the Bitcoin Core name. That's literally painting it as the main branch. There's like three damn posts on the front page of this sub about Ver and I'm sure if I pop over to r/btc I'll find the same thing and a few about how terrible r/bitcoin is and I'm so damn sick of it.
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:22:16
Just to be clear, did you buy $1000 worth of BTC at $19500/BTC or did you buy 1000 BTC?
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:14:31
You're probably joking but I'd really laugh if they actually did orchestrate this together. Roger reads Andreas' old tweet and says,  "Lets make you some money Andreas. I'll say something mean-ish to you. You tell them a sob story and we'll have a winner".
@_date: 2017-12-27 03:28:34
It's me.
@_date: 2017-12-04 18:52:38
Crypto doesn't necessarily mean you're going against the banks. I mean you can look at Ripple and say they're selling out the revolution but there's no reason why they can't co-exist. If there's only crypto, those who made the banking industry what it is, will just make crypto the new banking industry. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 05:28:22

Ok. You sounded like you were interested since you were arguing with me by saying I don't know how much she has. Frankly I don't care and stand by my statement. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 04:20:45
When. A year from now? Two? Be realistic. Do you think people will wait or will they move to faster cryptos without the fee problem. If Seattle Coffee makes better coffee and faster than Starbucks are you gonna get your coffee at Starbucks because reasons?
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:35:36
He and Roger are probably laughing over beers at all the people donating to him to stick it to Roger. Honestly, the Andreas worship here is as bad as the Roger worship over at Guys, don't be so gullible.

Student myself and have some invested but can't really make a sizeable investment because despite me being an adult, my bank still treats me as a minor because the parentals haven't given them the go ahead to give me access to my funds without their approval (except cheque and savings accounts). There's no way they'll let me invest in crypto so there's no point in even asking. This will probably be the case until I graduate. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 19:21:32

@_date: 2017-12-14 05:47:47
There really is no such thing as bad publicity. People who don't know him will do a bit of research, maybe agree with him (not unlikely with the shit fest that's bitcoin right now) and maybe not. Honestly I wouldn't mind people making their own informed decisions. What annoys me is going through or and seeing posts either praising people or ridiculing people. That's not what these subs are supposed to be about.

Please actually read the [announcement]( instead of just going by a post title. They're doing this.


Not their job


Once again its not their job to support development. They'll implement it when its done (as stated in the blog announcement). Also neither of your support development suggestions address the immediate problem. 


They're not switching to anything. They're adding payment methods with more coins to come.

How are you finding Binance. I want to buy altcoins and they seemed to be the best option from my research but haven't had actual users recommend it. How reliable are they and how often do they review their withdrawal fees based on coin prices. I see their bitcoin withdrawal fee hasn't changed since June/July when the price was much lower. Also are they affected by the recent China regulation scares?
