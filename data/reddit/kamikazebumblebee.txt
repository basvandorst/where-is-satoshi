Curbing "hate crimes" (in quotations) is different than forced labor. The bakery is being told that they need to view their customers equally, otherwise we might as well put signs up that say "no gays allowed", like the "no blacks allowed" before the 60s.
A government forcing a company to work for/with them, even if being reimbursed is still the government forcing someone to work for/with them.

4th, 5th, and 13th. I like it.

Their choice to do so, but they can't be forced. The epa example is moot. That's not the government forcibly employing a company to work for them. That's regulating an industry. Completely different beasts. This law does violate the 13th amendment.

My oh my it's a brave new world out there...

Government doesn't employ them, it's a different situation.

This woman is the most unamerican person. How she is a representative is beyond me.
She keeps trying to subvert the constitution, and it's not working for her. I can't wait for her to just stop already.
This law is questionable and most likely a violation of the 4th amendment and the 13th amendment.

Amendments are in addition to. They amend the original text, not make obsolete. If that were the case, the original text would just be thrown out and replaced.

Forcing someone or a company to work for you, regardless of being paid or not, when the person or company does not want to work for you, is involuntary servitude. They can't force you to work with/for them, even if they pay you. It violates the 13th amendment.

Not when said laws violate the constitution. It's hardly grey. Actually, it was one of Apple's main defenses against the fbi.
Following lawful requests for information, is quite different than developing techniques that they wouldn't normally employ just for the government to exploit. If the company needs to put in any kind of extra work to develop something against their will, guess what that is?

I did, but I am more focused on the idiot who's name is always all over these blatantly unconstitutional proposals.
I have no love for either side.

Except taxation is in the constitution. Article 1, section 8, clause 1.

the central banks are trembling at the prospect that they cant manipulate currency by printing more money..

Good luck with that.

I never understood why governments and economists like inflation.  wages are less and good cost more.

They have no authority to do so.
