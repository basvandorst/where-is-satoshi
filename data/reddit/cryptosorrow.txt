Is there a video review for this stuff?

This is invalid number. Click [view all]( and you will find out that there are about 2300 coins/tokens in total.

Quadriga, Cryptopia, Coinbene and DragoxEx, and now this. We should be using DEx as much as possible and ignore exchanges without proof of reserves.

There's a decentralized solution for KYC called Bridge Protocol but no one seems to use it.

Price's been going up an' down for the last few months. I got bored and stopped checking it.

We live in a world of uncertainty; it can't be predicted what happens to Bitcoin in a year. Who knows what black swans the future holds. You or anyone else have no idea what will be with Bitcoin in 10 years.

Benjamin Franklin once said: "Those who would give up essential Liberty, to purchase a little temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty nor Safety."
If you're not ready to take full responsibility for your own funds then crypto is just not for you. Go Paypal which can actually lock your account for no reason if you want a "safe" option.

Bitcoin ETFs have been denied ever since 2013 over and over again. What else could you expect?

How is this even possible in a NATO country

I mean shithole countries are not accepted to the alliance. Turkey is pretty much like Greece or Spain. This shouldn't have happened. However, I remember the 2013 bail-in in Cyprus. So, yes, anything can happen.
Anyway, the debt should have been deducted from the balance, not accounts got frozen.
And I'm not US citizen so I can't imagine how it is. I live in a second-world shithole in which nobody really cares about tax evasion.

Other exchanges are practicing the same + faking volumes. Most obvious examples are Okcoin, Hotbit, Digifinex, and other China-related exchanges. Check out their alexa rank vs trusted exchange like Binance or Bittrex.
It's unpleasant to admit but the truth is 60-80% of volume is fake (according to my brief research).

I tried to order coldcard a year ago or so. There was only delivery for business addresses in my country for some reason. I emailed support and got no reply, sadly.

I believe this is called application-specific sharding. Like one can 'attach' a subchain to the main network and make transactions, store data in it, etc. All the data is stored on the subchain; Bitcoin network is only used to settle the subchain blocks in a form of the block hash or something. So bitcoin network here is a notarization service.

How could people of the US let this happen? Private property in this country is kinda holy thing.

You should

It's a short squeeze. Still it might be the beginning of the next bull run.

So Bitcoin should **never** go PoS
