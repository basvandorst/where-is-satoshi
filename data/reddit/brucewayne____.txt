Personally - I'm ignoring the IRS guidance on mining and just paying income tax on what I cash out. This seems fair and if they question how I got the coins, I can just say I found them. It's way easier for me to keep track of.

Yeah I know, but consider this they will have a hell of a time trying to prove when I mined the coins. You could also just say you mined some random alt and sold them for BTC on a exchange that's now defunct, then cashed those out immediately to USD. Meh, not worried... calculating my mining profits to comply with the new IRS rules is way too much effort that I'd rather just get audited and pay the fine. If I was pulling in serious money, like $50-100k a year from mining, then I'd do things by the books.

Read what I posted again. I'm paying income tax on these coins that I "found." My story is I found them, and immediately converted them to USD. Pretty simple.
What IRS wants miners to do is pay tax on the value of coins the day were mined. This is almost impossible when you mine alts, value swings of 50% can happen in minutes.
And really, if I did that, it'd look even more sketchy when I mine an alt that's worth $100, then later it drops to $5. That could end up being a loss of $20,000 depending how many coins I mined. This is an extreme example but you get it.
Btw - I'd probably end up owing the IRS less if I said I mined them  because then I could deduct electricity and such. I really doubt they care in the end. It's just impossible to keep records when you are mining dozens of different coins with a huge flux in value.
ALSO I don't recommend anyone do what I'm doing, but I'm 99% sure it won't be an issue.
