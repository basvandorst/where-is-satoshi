He doesn't need to get paid if idiots fallow his advice (and they obviously have been) all he has to do is fill up his poo bags, tweet a shit coin a day and dump it when the plebs buy in. It's simple, it doesn't have to become some complicated conspiracy bs

But nobody cares about anything other than that these fundimentals will A:make this trash useable again and B:pump it
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:59:23
Hahaha like anyone is going to sell for 6k less than it is. Are you on crack?
@_date: 2017-12-31 11:52:13
Remember when fees where not rapish and Bitcoin was useable? Fuck you satoshi. Go die
@_date: 2017-12-25 21:11:24
All currency is imaginary, and worth something until it isn't for some reason. That's the real punch line.
@_date: 2017-12-25 02:49:40
Cept when they are obviously flooding the network with obsurdly low fee tx just to jack up the pool and price. All those less than 10 sat tx came from where? Can't think of anything or anywhere that does that. It's miner spam
@_date: 2017-12-26 02:08:55
Meh I don't pay attention to em, though I heard he pumped DGB lol
@_date: 2017-12-15 18:53:00
Not if spamming the network it's what is bloating the fees up that high. And it is. What real scenario can you think of we are so many people would be constantly sending transactions with such ridiculously low fees in Mass?
@_date: 2017-12-25 00:31:02
Newcomers think this is a second dip I guess
@_date: 2017-12-15 18:42:30
Yea, I recently accidentally sent at 5sat, not long ago and had to wait for it to just get dropped from the mempool.
Edit, though mine was dropped within 24 hours. This was during the 2x takeover scare with a near record high mempool
@_date: 2018-05-31 14:02:42

@_date: 2018-05-31 05:04:29
