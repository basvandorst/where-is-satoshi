Yes, this was back during the year of 2015, so even then ( I think worth was maybe $600-700) it was still unknown to many. They thought I was just making it up , legitimately. I showed my ewallet and showed worth and charts and they literally couldn't comprehend it, so I had to be a fraud to them .. It was heartbreaking. 
I am also proud of myself for keeping my wits about me, thank you for your time and comment :) 
Also Book of Eli was a fantastic movie! I've only seen it once during its debut but very cool!

This is a pretty spot on analogy , as the reality of who she is to me resembles red pill, and her and her town of ignorant people adhere to the blue pill. 
Thanks for reading :)

Haha thanks brotha.

They have, I spent a weekend in my hometown and saw her at that dudes house and she tried to reconnect immediately, uhhh no you're pregnant and I live in a separate state thanks anyways. 
It's really ironic. A kind of bittersweet joy.

You fool I just removed it. When you made those comments it was still there, i literally deleted it no more than an hour ago.
You sir are a coward. You had the last 24 hours to reply but instead now you do it. 
I don't give a shit if you want to be a delusional asshole, I don't. This will be the last thing I will ever say to you. 
You suffer from a superiority complex and I wish you the best, but your vicious attitude will not phase me, and I pity those who surround you.

That's my goal as well, to retire early and live peacefully and raise children and help fund their dreams and futures.

Hm. Not the way I imagined it. 
@_date: 2017-07-06 20:50:19
My biological family takes sort of extreme radical interest in our genes and spreading out last name in a sort of empire way, super not casual. Idk I just wanna make babies. 
Either way thank you for your comment :)

The mother of a child you both created. It's a casual term, mostly referred "Babymamma"
Pretty much just short for " Mother of my child"

Hahaha daaamn.

I agree, I went off who I thought she was or could of been, instead of who she really is.
This will help me in finding the right partner for sure. Lifelong lesson indeed. 
@_date: 2017-07-06 17:40:29
I like your style
@_date: 2017-07-06 21:30:37
Valiant effort. 
@_date: 2017-07-06 18:05:43
Thank you! She was very manipulative, in fact one aspect I spoke of but didn't finish on was how her parents asked me to move in because " I made her so happy" I later realized all they wanted was help with their own debt. I didn't have a problem with it but they invited me to move in on that basis within our first 2 weeks of dating. 
Like I said I was more than financially stable enough but I was mostly blind to all the deceit for far too long. 
When I was in college I had some girls act that way too, it's mostly an attention thing to them, it's pretty foul I can agree. As far as the restraining order goes, if she isn't bluffing that aspect for attention and she actually follows up with it, there are ways to prove blasphemy and slander to the court, if you can provide evidence with social media or phone records , even parking precaution, you can avoid the charge. Always think ahead and cover your own ass and nothing can stop you. For example, if she messages you, don't even respond. Showing that to a judge would show you seriously want nothing to do with her and a restraining order isn't necessary because you have no intentions of contact and don't want to tarnish your name. 
Just a thought. 
Also yes , cyber security, some dudes I worked with actually got up to making six figures !! That's where the bank is at my friend, and it's a pretty fun career lf you're passionate about it. 
Thank you for your comment :)

Wow 60! That's awesome! 
I will definitely start traveling long term in the next few years, it's the thing I admire most. 
Thank you for your wisdom :) 
@_date: 2017-07-06 23:34:40
I touched up on her parents in a comment, an aspect I forgot to finish on in the original post. Her family only wanted me to move in to help with their debt, which I did for 3 months before I decided to leave for the city. They manipulated me with the "happiest she's ever been" and being young and not thinking clearly because of my feelings, went right along with it. 
Her asking me to liquidate was because the only way she'd fully believe what I had was if it was cold hard cash in front of her, which isn't the point of bitcoin whatsoever. I tried to explain this concept and I was only met with accusations of being a fraud, even with all of the legitimate proof I presented she just waved it all off as some imaginary internet money. 
It's fine if you don't want to believe me. I didnt do this for attention or pity, I did it because I haven't been able to fully disclose my feelings on the subject. I do feel very much better now. 
I appreciate your comment never the less.
@_date: 2017-07-07 00:57:08
Yeah but if anything we would be a long way from marriage, so she would just want to manipulate my feelings into me just pretty much letting her use my funds. 
Which I was not for.
@_date: 2017-07-08 19:21:03
What are you talking about? 
Dude I'm not sure what your problem is but , damn. 
There's no deleted original comment.
@_date: 2017-07-06 17:17:55
Yes, I'm very happy and proud of myself as well, I feel as if I have gained inner peace, which has been a driving force for me to progress and move on. Thank you for your comment :) 
@_date: 2017-07-06 23:12:15
I am 25 now, this all happened when I was 23. 
I feel like my life is already over , is that natural? Am I wrong for thinking that? 
@_date: 2017-07-08 20:00:35
I check out your profile because you're so goddamn confusing, and it looks like you're this arrogant all the time to strangers. Some of your posts and comments are very rude and you clearly don't respect people. I'm sorry you feel this way and I hope one day you find peace. Also, this is me replying to the single chain thread, which is your apparent *deleted original comment*, that was never deleted. ��
Have fun living the bitter life friend. I've been there and it was before my life turned around and there are better ways to carry yourself. I wish you the best of luck. 
Take care.
@_date: 2017-07-06 20:32:29
Well, I never told her how much I had in USD from the civilian contract, but when she asked about BTC I only gave her a very very rough estimate. 
Basically I lied and cut the actual amount by 1/3. 
The problem was they simply didn't understand it whatsoever, and thought of me as a fraud or a liar, as if none of it existed. I remember some 17 year old kid and his parents mocking me on Facebook for my imaginary internet money. If I didn't completely delete my Facebook I'd use it as source material for bitcoin memes, because it was totally absurd. 
@_date: 2017-07-06 21:13:40
Haha thanks , but honestly I'm not about to wipe the floor with her, because A) she's already pretty much fucked her life up now with that new dude and B) since the relationship I've progressed into quite the alpha ( sounds kind of cheesy but I feel it) 
HOWEVER, when I do decide to drop a few coins, I'm going to use it to travel the world for a few months, video myself with a ton of babes, take tons of fantastic photos of wicked locations ( Peru Rome Paris Bahamas Cancun ) and upload them to a newly created Facebook, and then add every single one of my old haters. She will be my first friend request :) 
THAT sounds a little cruel but I could do way worse and I feel like this would really make her regret her ignorant perspectives.

Thanks for reading!

Okay that's pretty clear but I don't think it's solely "black" slang, and just slang in general. Degeneracy isn't race specific. 
I could be wrong and it could be proven but I wouldn't want to be that blatant about it. ��

I wish bots had more personality sometimes, waiting on it to caps lock rage.

I am very relieved, I learned that even though someone has potential and you can see them being a great human being, doesn't mean they want to be. 
I wish us the best of luck friend! 
@_date: 2017-07-06 23:38:50
I asked him to DM me for details so I could decide myself if it was something worthwhile or not, to taste the legitimacy of it. 
I'll admit it sounded strange to me too, and he hasn't messaged me yet, so I'm thinking it's not something for me. 
Thanks for looking out, gives me a Chance to upvote you again kind sir :) 
@_date: 2017-07-06 19:11:05
Thank you for your interest and time! 
@_date: 2017-07-06 21:29:56
Well, first of all I never gave her the full worth of the BTC I owned, nor ever once mentioned the amount of USD I had from Florida. I cut what the BTC was worth by 1/3 , but I had to try my best to explain the currency. Back then it wasn't even a lot, in fact Back then I had more USD than I did with what I had in bitcoins. 
Idk if jealousy was the issue, more like they were incomprehensible on the subject matter and instead turned to insults and vicious assumptions. 
And, as stated in the original post, I worked for cyber security. I fully understand privacy and security. This was a woman I wanted to marry and have children with. I didn't put myself in any risk other than what they did anyways, which was assume I'm a trash can.
Either way thanks for your comment and time. 
@_date: 2017-07-06 19:41:44
Technically she got rid of me thinking I was some lowlife , but I couldn't more lucky , because my delusional ass probably would of done everything for her , even with her foul attitude. After her leaving me it really opened my eyes and I became proud of me for standing my ground, and moved on to progress myself instead of dwindling on some vile person. 
@_date: 2017-07-08 19:24:26
Dude WHAT LOL 
There is *no deleted original comment* 
Double check.
The first time you posted this exact comment was in response to the original comment you speak of, which is still not deleted. Anyone can look and find it, and we all know you and mods are the only capable ones of fully deleting it. Please, carry yourself with more respect for people you don't know. 
@_date: 2017-07-06 23:07:59
Is that a legitimate offer? You should DM me. 
@_date: 2017-07-06 18:10:12
I feel the same way. 
Thank you for the comment :) 
@_date: 2017-07-06 20:25:13
Very true, I was blinded by what I saw is becoming. We could of had a very dope family and life, but she couldn't get passed her own problems to see what I did. 
Thank you for your comment :)

Well done , more karma for you friend.

Very true, thank you.

Ah good catch, I didn't even notice it myself. Thanks friend.
@_date: 2017-07-06 21:52:52
The thing is there was no reason to liquidate, and she just couldn't understand that. I had enough USD, MORE than enough to move us out, and she couldn't get over the fact that her and her family and her friends and her friends family just all assumed I was making this BTC up completely out of my ass. So yeah, nah. She can go, the BTC was here first. 
@_date: 2017-07-06 17:54:15
I feel the same way, how she dipped on me at 11pm the night before move in, forcing us to break the lease, I can see it being the same way. Part of me felt like I could show her our potential and maybe help her, who knows. 
But yes I agree it couldn't have ended well for me. 
Thank you for your comment :)
