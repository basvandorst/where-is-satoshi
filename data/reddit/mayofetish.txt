ORDER BITCORN
@_date: 2017-12-05 14:13:38
Same here with Tesla. I bought in week 1 at $17 per share. I sold after it doubled. Now it's almost $300.  If I kept my bitcoins that I sold in 2013 I would have paid for half of my house today. Gotta shrug it off.
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:33:43
Yes it is. 
@_date: 2014-07-24 14:19:07
Pay with bitcoin is not an option when I check out.

I set up a coinbase account last week and it took maybe 15 minutes because I knew my bank info. 
Easy Peasy.
