When deflation is here, I am 100% sure that people will still produce goods and deliver services. And that is because:
1. Water
2. Food
3. Medical treatments
4. etc you can imagine youself
Now tell me, before gold and currency was here, how humans survive anyway?
Not sure whether you will criticize my statements, but I have to tell you I never fail to get an A in my economic exams and I still think econs is fking bullshit. And at least look at the video below to educate yourself:

Wrong. If a currency is lost, e.g. USD / Bitcoin, the rest of the currency increases by a bit in their own value while the value of the total currency stays constant (assuming no inflation or deflation and ceteris paribus).
edit: Thus it does not matter whether Fed is monitoring and increasing the supply or not. The thing that matters is Fed can increase money supply like no one else to benefits themselves. At least watch the video below to educate yourself.

I am very sure US and China needs deflation and my own country as well.
Unless you have a way for the poor not to be poorer?
edit: I realised no one has a way either so you are not to be blamed. I am waiting for all the bubbles to burst and lazy rich people and some corrupt governments can f themselves. When was the last crazy bubble again?

No I am not an anarchist.
Just as I said, economic growth is not bad, and thus credit is not bad too if use wisely and responsibly.
It's the humanity thing I am saying, capitalism and greed. And thus the 20 minutes cartoon video on how money is created by FED and rothschild. And the rise of debts all along.
LSE is part of University of London (UOL) technically (I am not so sure ya)

Well, my point is, necessary evils like greed for money and power(nature human beings who disqualify for discipline) does not need rectification and they can definitely go to hell.
I would say inflation is good for the economy, but the fact that some brainless people who want stock market bubbles and those who inflates the housing prices can go f themselves. Who else mentions the US debts?
Thus I am totally okay with deflation. Human needs discipline and people won't die easily because of deflation, I can be 100% for sure.
edit: I know the case of Japan but if their economy is going to fail, then why not? They can start all over again. It's not like they stop eating right? Somebody has to produce rice!
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:30:01
I did not say economic growth is bad.
Okay. Can you tell me when stock market are being over valued is a good thing? Or housing prices inflated like hell is also a good thing? How high is US debt now?
Nowadays people spend money faster and irresponsible way crazier than before (look at 11/11 Alibaba). Well I need to mention that I am an aspiring minimalist (not a real minimalist yet) so you know what I was trying to say.
Yea deflation transfer wealth to creditors, but I also remember correctly that a lot business declared bankruptcy and failed to pay back their debt like Trump during inflation times (another point for bubbles)? If your business can't make money why expands it so much and most of the expenses are on credit?
Credits credits, no wonder bubbles happen, and everything collapses.
Poor lives a lot better, but the riches are way more superior. Try asking the poor people if they can imagine how wealthy the riches are. They can't because it's so damned pathetic and being poor limits your imagination.

And you knows that inflation creates bubbles, over-expectation and people killed themselves because stock market bubble burst and I salute you.
Remember it's all your faults (not you specifically, but those who want meaningless growth) when you expect so much and I am the one to laugh.
I am an aspiring minimalist.

It drops like hell since 19k
@_date: 2017-12-11 14:26:00
Even though Japan has deflation, but they are still producing goods and services like everyone else in the world right?
Do you still remember how people used to trade in the old days before currency and gold was here?
@_date: 2017-12-11 14:32:14
As you have said "Wall Street is here", at least educate yourself with this video:
@_date: 2017-12-11 14:17:14
Not exactly true.
My point is, inflation was caused by increased in debts.
Do me a favor, tell me how debt in the US or even global debt is going to be "settled" and then everyone is happy.
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:04:16
I know the case of Japan economy. If the country is going to suffer and fail, so be it, instead of living in the American dream.
I laughed awkwardly because of your last sentence.

See you in the AI world in 2050.

He fking thinks that basic econ 101 is 100% legit
edit: and he ignores the fact that our world was actually built upon barter system in the first place
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:08:51
And you said you don't watch 20 minutes cartoon video.
My degree is from UOL-LSE Lol
edit: People needs to realise that they are the cancer on this earth by the way. Now if you can solve the issue the poor getting poorer, please talk like one. If not what is the point?
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:11:20
Before you go, please explain, I don't get it.
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:09:21
Yea you guys don't want famine, don't want to be broke, don't want to living on the streets. I know.
But living in an economy that is being manipulated, corrupted, in the hands of the power...hmm, even over a century.
Do people even think what's the point of living? Nevermind if this goes too far for you.

He analyzed the bitcoin market in his own way. Although it's gambling, he managed his risk very well I guess?
