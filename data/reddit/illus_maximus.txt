You saved me, I literally was worried I'd never trip in solace again..
My entire consciousness was crumbling down around me when you brought me back.. I will go no further for fear will encompass dread

There is a 20billion dollar note pictured... 20 billion
Literally this currency is no longer existant.. you are mistaken to say that a currently circulating monetary note is worse off than a banknote not accepted by anyone anywhere.

Yes it is!

Unless it is? Seriously though someone check that dead guys laptop with the 300 million $ in bitcoins for his minecraft files.

When bitcoin hit 20k I figured some if the bitcoin whales must be flying around on nonstop flights with  other planes refueling them. Cocaine would be mixed with the oxygen onboard and good times would be had by all.. but still satoshi hodls on for more!

Are beers served warm in Kenya? I'll save my satoshi, thank you.

This is basically the all the information I just read in the post summed up in 2 seconds.. upvote this post.. people need to know

A lot like if someone were to find out you hold coins.. extortion and threats of lost digits for passwords is likely something already happening

I want to HODL but I also want to get wasted in Aruba!

Here's hoping that it makes a comeback!

Yeah I often think of when I used to trade 60 bitcoins for 500 ecstacy pills when bitcoin was hovering around 30$ and thinking of what could have been. But realistically if I wouldnt have spent all the coins I would've just sold them when they hit 100 dollars a piece without hesitation 
@_date: 2019-04-01 22:17:02
Why do you think I dont have 1million bitcoins.. I ate all that x. 0 return I have holes in my brain that are bigger than the inflation in Venezuela

If it hits 6k it will peak 20k a week later.. and 60k the week after that

Bitcoin is at rock bottom it should take a mild upward swing over the next 2 or 3 days should be a good turn for you
@_date: 2019-09-10 16:23:15
Bitcoin will survive

Alls I can think is if I see a fucking altoids tin inside of a drawer I'm fucking opening that cuz that's where someone is hiding the goods.
 Try leaving your cold storage with several other flash drives of the 512mb variety and they'll be safe forever wherever they may be.

 I found 4 old san disks i used for school when cleaning my house, they were in the front of an old CD protecter. they've been a complete set for 10 years. Nobody bothered them so at least in my house they would be safe, but I too would be at least curious to see what they held sure.
