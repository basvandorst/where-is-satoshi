Ooooo there's the kicker. ~~Maybe we advertise the shit out of this.~~
Edit: Thanks for the info on GoX I read a little about it earlier but I didnt grasp the whole story. Everything is coming together now.

Thanks this graph is very helpful.

Okay I get it now the difficulty increases over time but the reward is only halved every couple years. If one wants to increase returns they have to constantly invest invest in more computer power.

Any chance this influenced the ~~bubble of 2013~~ price spike in April 2013? Demand should increase after the split and the old bitcoins should technically be worth more. The price of BTC after 3-months was up %300 following the 2012 split. Im not implying there is a chance of bubble, but I do smell something that is making me want  to invest more.
Edit: strike through

Oookay thanks that makes alot sense now. Is the block reward decreased over time or at a single moment?

Cool thanks for the info.

Sorry your right. I meant to reference the spike 4 months after following the split. The price barely changed the whole months after the split so I guess it is possible it might not in 15weeks.

Good point I wonder how volatile it is compared to 2013?

I definitely I agree it doesn't make much since to me.The difficulty of generating these blocks increases over time, but  price decreases at a set point. If you buy mining equipment today your initial investment into mining will fall by more than %50 this year because it will take a longer time to earn less an award.

I know I'm kinda excited to see what will happen now that I know more. Hopefully something interesting
