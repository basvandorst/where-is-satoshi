Well, if that's the status when he sells, then yup.
Your hypothetical loss is only realized when it's sold for fiat.  You're just chasing waterfalls here with semantics.

If the stock recovers before he sells, there's no loss.
@_date: 2014-12-23 02:57:04
"Gain"/"Loss" does not mean "***un***realized gain"/"***un***realized loss". Why would we even have those distinct terms if it did?
At best, we're both wrong.

Losses and gains exist only when they are realized.

This is my thought. I don't buy them alone but the office pool lady cones through and hey.. why not.  It's fun to dream and the 2 bucks to be in with the whole office and share the fun is worth whatever thing I was going to do with $2

@_date: 2015-07-07 01:57:30
Price went from $600 to $1000 in a couple weeks. "Price is up 40%, why buy now?"
A couple months later the price was $250.

It's actually a compromise, and the merchant can easily avoid paying for chargebacks on fraudulent transactions by following their agreement to the T.

Canada is only larger than China or the US when adding in its surface water (lakes etc). 
Land-only, it is smaller than both.
@_date: 2016-07-03 05:51:11
*online* duh.  all online sales are automatic chargebacks, because online sales are invalid in the agreement. 
I was speaking generally, on swiped/keyed transactions.   Nothing in this thread talks about online transactions only.


Nope, if it's illegible, the credit card company takes a writeoff.  If it's missing, the vendor takes a chargeback.  If it's legible but doesn't match the same name, vendor takes the hit.


Well no shit, it's a fraud investigation.  You might be complicit.


No, the customer has to sign an affidavit stating they weren't involved, so now you're talking about a dispute, which isn't fraud.
@_date: 2016-07-07 16:36:09
Weren't you complaining the merchant pays for theft in the credit card model and then using bitcoin as a corollary to cash?  In both models the merchant gets fucked.  Not sure what you're trying to say.  At least in Visa fraud cases it's 50/50 who takes the hit.

There are other exchanges besides gox.  They usually trade within a few BTC of each other and they are all down quite a few btc
@_date: 2013-11-02 03:07:45
Psychologically paying $100 for .5 somethings makes me feel like I'm being cheated, and buying 50000 somethings makes me feel like I am buying something worthless.  If I buy 500 somethings for $100 it's an easier and less unsettling option.

I don't think we will see sub 100 barring something crazy again. It'll drop soon, i think, but not below 100. I wish it would, though.  If i were buying in now, I'd wait for this current rally to cool off and buy in around 110 if possible.

This isn't even germaine to the discussion, but what would you rather have, $0.05/oz price increase while holding 500 oz of copper or $0.05/oz increase when holding 0.5 oz of gold?

He pulled the data engine site for mtgox and searched for 'cloudflare', and it was present.  They already use it.

They take both ways, look at your ins in btc and your outs in USD.  You'll see a fee each time.

I'd advise not to panic sell, and sometimes it takes time to execute during high volume.

It would be preferable to have sane and competent agents like this one offer capitulations that affirm bitcoin'legitamacy than to have to fight an uphill battle from behind bars for simply owning a commodity.
@_date: 2013-11-02 05:14:59
With 500 oz of copper any movement in the price would result in à tidy profit.   I would still only be buying half of something, which feels less satisfying than having a reasonable whole number

Don't sell.  Wait until it drops precipitously and buy more.

Three-ish Sundays ago a huge sell order came through at the same time a huge buy wall was up.   The sell broke through the huge buy wall and dropped the price by ~$10 in less than an hour.    Rumor was it was a newbie who sold out all at once and didn't realize the drop in price could have been mitigated over time.  It happened again the next week, another $10 drop.  
I don't really think "Whale Drop Sunday" is an accurate moniker but it's been evangelized heavily.
Price was around $130 before, then 120, then 115-ish and now we're just slipping anyhow, i don't think it's the same situation.  Seems more like people are panic selling.

Two transactions through bitinstant last two days, worked perfectly (on their end at least.)  Setting up the MoneyGram was a PITA at the stores i was dropping cash off at.

I disagree, only on the functionality -- using gox's interface to make trades is absolutely superior to any other exchange i've tried (campbx, bitstamp, etc).  it takes three reloads on a php site on campbx and bitstamp's trade screen is just unhelpful.
on gox i can trade immediately, and in quick succession.  My only gripe is their absolute insistance on leading zeroes (.3 is invalid - please enter 0.3)
