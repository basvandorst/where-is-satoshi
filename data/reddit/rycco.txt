4 months later and we still don't know what happened to our money! I still believe that the US government hold those bitcoins, and this case have something to do with SERIOUS shit.

Yeah man you're fucking right. People are not losing faith on bitcoins as a investment or as a currency. The price isn't dropping. But people are taking MtGox prices seriously and there's nothing you can do there by now if you can't take neither money or bitcoins there.

How far is is from amsterdam? What time usually does the bars and cafés close?

Doesn't matter if you don't think so, it IS. Have you ever tried to send money from one country to another? Have you ever filled lots of pappers on when opening an account on traditional banks? If yes, then you can get my point.

If you bought at 800+ or 1000+, the worst thing to do is selling right now. The secret of the game is: Buy low, sell high. If you do the opposite, then you're not making money at all.
Complete the timeline:
Bitcoin went over 200, then it came back to 80, 60, 100... Then it went over 1200, then it came back to 500, 600, 700...
Then, again, over 1000+, then 800, 700, 600...
Then... :D

It's not just an Altcoin, it's new kind of cryptocoin approach that we, the bitcoin users, can't just ignore it. I think it's worth the discussion of the Poof-of-Stake protocol. Remember that Bitcoin started someday.

Ok. Now where's our money?

Dear MtGox Customers,
In the event of recent news reports and the potential repercussions on MtGox's operations and the market, a decision was taken to close all transactions for the time being in order to protect the site and our users. We will be closely monitoring the situation and will react accordingly.
Best regards,
MtGox Team

Ahhh shit. Yeah! That's right, huh.

There's something very wrong in this story. 850.000 doesn't disappear, and if MtGox was really hacked, why didn't they show the blockchain proof? Actually, MtGox never said what really happened. The question is: why?
@_date: 2014-02-26 04:48:12
I told you guys, that was just numbers since anybody could withdraw. The market saw later.

Ok, bits is great. And please do it fast because I'm tired of explaining everytime that you can buy fractions of bitcoins.

It have to start someway, because you can't mine those coins.
@_date: 2014-02-14 04:03:25
It's just dropping because there are people panic selling based on MtGox charts. That sucks.

Buy how for how much would you sell a piece of the revolutionary banking system named Bitcoin?  My pieces worth more than $900 for sure.
