Buy gold, buy Bitcoin, build a nuclear shelter and don't have sex because you might get AIDS

Malta is one of the countries fraudulent companies go to orchestrate their europeans scams.
The idiocy on this sub.

See that's the problem with crypto. It's easy enough to get scammed with fiat but crypto is so much worse. Sometimes having third parties is good even if costly

Excellent! J'ai vu un documentaire sur MtGox, quoi qu'on en dise bien ou mal c'est une sacrée histoire. En plus j'habite à Dijon, je trouvais ça marrant et improbable que tu viennes de là-bas.
