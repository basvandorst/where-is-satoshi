Still, maybe OP's house collapsed in it's own footprint in free fall speed. And a nearby building collapsed too, just because.

+1 on that!! Right now I have to manually use some cputhrottle binary I found to throttle the CPU the Bitcoin Core process uses.

Convert to Bitcoin ~50% of the capital using some service like Bitstamp, Coinbase or any other exchange, transfer the Bitcoins to your own wallet and when the storm has passed you can decide what to do.

8 is the lucky number in China because it sounds like "luck" (or something similar), 4 is the least popular number because it sounds like "death". So, yeah, I don't think many Chinese miners would support 4MB anyway :)

Just note that once you use one of these services which "hold the money for you" you are basically acquiring counterparty risk against those institutions (i.e. if Bitreserve or coinapult go bankrup, your money evaporates). In the other hand, you don't have counterparty risk by holding Bitcoin yourself (you do have FX risk if you intend to convert Bitcoins to Dollars or any other fiat n the future though)

Hey Victoria, first of all, great work with the Twitter support!
I think some way to support private github repos would be great. I tried inviting the  bot to our company repo but he didn't accept.
Also HipChat from Altassian is quite bit inside companies and it would be great if you could support it.

True, I guess the virtual keyboard blockchain.info offers when you are entering the 2nd password helps with that.

As mentioned by some comments above, I think there should be a way of making sure that when you click a 0.006 bits link, the amount charged is actually 0.006 and not higher. Other than that, impressive job! $5 for @_date: 2014-02-25 12:52:03

Apparently they pulled it down because it was a hoax:

I used XKCD's advice posted earlier. The difficulty of  this 1st password combined with the 2FA and a similarly difficult 2nd password make me feel quite assured, honestly.

If you try to go to  from outside US they will redirect you to your country domain. There you should see something like this  ("Continue to the U.S. site at Expedia.com").
Once there, you should see the Bitcoin option in the payment page (for Hotels only).
Hope that helps.
@_date: 2014-06-12 03:29:17
They're only rolling it out on the US Point Of Sale but you can get to that point of sale from anywhere in the world, see the prices in USD and then pay in Bitcoin, so it shouldn't be a problem!

OP, that's a legitimate request but just FYI you can still go to the US site and pay with Bitcoin, even from Germany. They will redirect you to  but on the top of the page you should see a link saying something like "bring me to expedia.com" ;)
The only drawback is that the page will be in English.

I don't think that will happen in Singapore. They're quite non-interventionist in the business realm as far as I have seen.
@_date: 2014-03-03 02:42:06
Agreed. I like it.

Gold is traded as a commodity but you don't pay any VAT (at least here in Singapore).

I am sorry but I disagree. Of course it's still prone to "massive shocks" as you put it, but after every shock it has grown stronger and better than before: hacking attempts, blockchain fork, bitcoin thefts, China ban, Russia ban, etc.
I think all this shocks come precisely from unavoidable natural stressors (volatility, time and randomisation). What Taleb advocates, precisely, is not the avoidance of the stressors (which is impossible) but using every "hit" by the stressors to improve and grow instead of suffer unrecoverable losses like when a plan when it crashes.
As always antifragility can be seen from many differents Point of View, if you look only at Bitcoin price evolution you may consider it fragile, but if you look at the full picture and history of Bitcoin and specially it's open source, distributed nature you should conclude that it's at least robust and arguably antifragile.

You should never trust Spanish travel companies. ~~Book flights with Bitcoin at Expedia instead!~~

You are right. Expedia doesn't have an Slovenian POS as far as I know (and I work there). But yeah, I would really like to see this rolled out globally in all POS specially South East Asia.

In Singapore you can withdraw "as much as you want" (I guess up to 500k SGD or even 1M), no notice required. Oh, and you can buy/sell gold at the bank too!

Not 100% correct, they will also be downloadable when you manually generate a "Share" link.
Anyhow, if Google indexed the link it means it somehow made it to a webpage and, well, if you are that careless what do you expect?

I'm with coinclippers here... It's true that 99.9% of "tech savvy" people would know to put the shit in the body tag but it still might be a sloppy placeholder for whoever will paste the announcement knows where to paste it. 
It's MtGox, they're sloppy by definition.
That said, I hate them as much as you do for the damage and loss they caused and I agree it might all be a manipulation.
@_date: 2014-03-01 01:50:13
Indeed. It's one of their differential traits. The typical Singaporean assumes that if there is a queue formed "it must be really good" OR "They're giving away something for free/promotion".
They specially apply that logic to food stalls at the hawker centres.
@_date: 2014-02-10 14:13:01
Do you have proof of the dumping? I hate mt gox as much as anyone but proof is needed still.
@_date: 2014-03-07 08:06:02
good argument.
I was thinking about it but it will be impossible to find the truth unless the "real Satoshi" admit being Dorian Nakamoto. Otherwise, it they both keep negating they are the same person, there is no way to proof anything for sure :(

“Every plane crash brings us closer to safety, improves the system, and makes the next flight safer—those who perish contribute to the overall safety of others. Swiss flight 111, TWA flight 800, and Air France flight 447 allowed the improvement of the system. But these systems learn because they are antifragile and set up to exploit small errors; the same cannot be said of economic crashes, since the economic system is not antifragile the way it is presently built.”
Excerpt From: Nassim Nicholas Taleb. “Antifragile: Things That Gain From Disorder.”
I would argue that the Bitcoin system is antifragile and will get stronger with every difficulty that it has to overcome.

I am afraid you cannot neither prove nor disprove a causal link between the fact that the price has risen 100% over the last 6 months and how the Bitcoin ecosystem is evolving. 
Countless random and unpredictable factors influence the price. To name a few: Chinese monetary policies, FX rates, Stock markets, regulatory events, pure randomness...
@_date: 2017-03-13 14:20:49
Right, that depends on your definition of trolling, I'd just call it "controversial" at best. If the cap fits, wear it.
@_date: 2017-03-13 13:41:30
Where is the trolling? The ~~variable~~ constant (FTFY) name looks accurate to me. In CS it's always good to name "things" as descriptively as possible, even if names are long.
edit: And also FYI looking down on JavaScript it's kind of passé, a lot of important services you probably use every day use node in production.

Precisely, *you never saw one* - that's why people call them Bin Ladens. I was just highlighting that Sander's implication of "People call them Bin Ladens because terrorist use them" is false.
@_date: 2016-02-16 18:52:30
Sand's argument is pure BS. The reason it is known as 'Bin Laden' - at least in Spain - is because "no one has ever seen one" i.e. they are hidden like Bin Laden was before they killed him.

It would not make sense for him to buy so many BTC just before announcing it, as he himself would move the market and would probably earn nothing. Proper insider trading is done discreetly, buying quantities small enough so they won't move the market against you.
So he might have done insider trading - very possible -, but I don't think he is the whale anyway. My theory the whale is someone close to him who knew that "in half an hour Kim Dotcom will make an awesome kick-ass announcement related to BTC".

That's only if MtGox will actually transfer your BTC... I have an 80 BTC outgoing transfer from MtGox to my Bitstamp address stuck for more than a day, no transaction showing on BlockChain and the assistance guys are ignoring me, of course.

@_date: 2013-11-07 09:00:21
Right, I guess I learned that "the hard way". Anyway, I think the issue is in MtGox side, they simply never did the transfer (which can be proved looking at the BlockChain).
I will update if I ever get the Bitcoins :(

My 80 BTC just arrived, after almost 2 days so yours should arrive soon too. One thing is clear, I will never use MtGox again.
Best of luck!
@_date: 2013-11-07 12:22:14
Same here, I got 80 BTC "stuck" in MtGox for around 40 hours until they finally came. Best thing is, I deposited the BTC to MtGox, then I changed my mind and in less than an hour I requested the withdrawal! Only God knows what MtGox does with user's bitcoins...
One thins is clear, there is something very wrong with MtGox and I will never use it again.
