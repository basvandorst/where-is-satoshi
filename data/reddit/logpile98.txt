Unless everyone moves on to some other crypto. Not trying to spread FUD or anything, but as fast as this space is moving I think it's naive to say that about ANY crypto.

Statements like this scare me. That's a  textbook indication of a bubble and makes me not want to hodl

Forget that the white paper described it as a peer-to-peer electronic CASH system and that it's not usable as that, you should buy it because it goes up. See, bitcoin is different, because it goes up and can never do anything else. It's not a bubble, because bubbles pop and the price drops, but that will NEVER happen to bitcoin. No, it's gonna go up and up forever! /s

If someone hasn't already made it, I'm sure we're not far from something like that. Call it PolitiCoin or CampaignCoin. BlockchainCampaign?
CampaignCoin is the world's first to make use of the blockchain to crowdsource campaign funding in a distributed decentralized buzzword platform ledger. Coming soon to a wallet near you!

Maybe, maybe not. I'm sure people said the same thing about AOL and MySpace. Apple did not invent the first MP3 player, nor the first GUI, and yet they're well-known for both. As young as crypto is, we simply can't know what's gonna be around 15 years from now.

Come on let's be real here, crypto will never completely eliminate banks.

You are fooling yourself if you think Bitcoin won't be affected by this. When this thing pops, pretty much all cryptos will crash HARD, and they will drag BTC down too.

You might wanna check with a tax professional about this, because I'm not sure that you can selectively choose which one you sell. It might be FIFO, where they assume the first ones you sell are the first ones you bought.

It doesn't matter, if you live in the US, the IRS views buying any product or service with crypto as a taxable event. If you buy $100 worth of bitcoin and it goes to $500, and then you use that $500 to buy a computer, then in the eyes of the IRS you just realized a capital gain of $400 and have to pay capital gains tax on that.

He mentioned GTAT, a stock that went to zero. He probably bought into the hype and put lots of money into it because it was "gonna be huge! Change the world!" They filed for bankruptcy and aren't around anymore.
People like you are gonna cause many others to get burned. The idea of "bitcoin keeps going up, it will always keep going up" is gonna come crashing down and many people will be hurt by it. Also that last line in your comment is just a shitty and douchey thing to say to someone.

Just because manipulation has always been present doesn't mean we shouldn't call it out when we see it and try to prevent it from happening as much as possible.

Yeah for real. Despite countries banning it, fees climbing higher and higher, and it being removed from places like Steam because it's just not viable as a currency, the price still skyrocketed? People in this sub will scream that it's a store of value and not a currency, as if that was the original intention all along. But it wasn't. And people outside this sub aren't buying in because they believe it will change the world and lead to decentralized currency for everyone, they're buying it because it's had an insane bull run and they wanna get rich quick. The market is NOT rational right now and I'm very worried. I'm reminded of that Warren Buffet quote: "When people are greedy, be scared, and when people are scared, be greedy". People are DEFINITELY greedy right now.
