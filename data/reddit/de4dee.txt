1 thing:
buy when it goes down 30% or something from ATH.

best explanation of recent days

it cannot bank the unbanked. bank is a place where you can store money. or get loan. 
neither is possible with bitcoin.
without a credit score system there wont be loans. privacy needs in bitcoin is against credit score system..

after split; 
1. get a small amount of newly mined bitcoin 1x from a faucet or a seller. 
2. send that to existing address hodling your bitcoin 1x. 
3. move the COMBINED amount to another wallet in 1x.
COMBINED amount wont be valid on 2x chain because newly mined BTC 1x never existed on 2x. 2x will ignore your transaction.
this will free your BTC on 1x.
Same applies for 2x.

I think it is related to global threats of war.
Instead of gold they choose e-gold.
For several days the money was escaping from world and into altcoins.
Today from world to bitcoin maybe..

no. the money decreases in value every year 2%. check out what the inflation is.
the interest you pay is actually deducted from your income. thats another benefit..

They just said fluctuation is correlated with forum usage. Which is like saying people are posting on forums while price is fluctuating. Duh..
I am feeling sorry for korean state for funding this.

Would you be interested in a social trading project? I.e. Copying successful traders' positions automatically

I think you have made the correct decision.
You owed one asset before. Which was your house.
Now you own three assets:
1. bitcoin is an asset
2. the good old asset, your house is continuing to appreciate.
3. the debt. now some may say the debt is actually a liability. screw them. debt is an asset. why?   each year inflation reduces your debt by 2%.  
now if a depression hits; you still have bitcoins to liquidate and save your house.
if bitcoin price reduces, well, as the old say there is no free lunch.
