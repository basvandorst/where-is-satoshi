is a lot less frantic.

FUD.  Mr. Gox stepped down from the bitcoin foundation, they've deleted their twitter feed, and there's still been no new update on the ongoing situation there.

Yep.  The Here and Now piece was utter shit.  I was flipping off my radio.  I went to go see if I could comment someplace but they need registration.  Such a shitty, shitty interview.  The funniest part was that their 'expert' has never even transacted with bitcoin either.

[Thanks Bitcoin](

Interesting.  Thanks, I'll try again (well...for the like 5th time).

Well, I've tried two separate computers and two separate browsers on each.  Same damn thing.   I don't see any contact info on the page.  Does anyone know how to get some support or figure out wtf is the problem?  I was staged to buy a pile at 106 and now its already back to 115.  Goddammitsomuch coinbase &gt;_&lt;

I'm kinda miffed that it seem Gox trends higher because I bought my coins under that metric and now I'm looking to offload them at a consistently lower index.  That gets coinbase a pretty penny off the top when they switch, no?

Found a support contact, got this followup:
'I'm very sorry about this error - we had a user-interface bug and a button wasn't showing properly. As a security measure, we now require a phone number verification in order to execute bitcoin purchases. If you don't have a cell phone or can't receive SMS messages, we're working on a mechanism through which you could be verified without these. Thanks for your patience in this matter and sorry for the inconvenience!'
Digging around in account settings I found the section.  Hopefully this will be useful to someone else.

Thanks.  That's a change since the last time I moved coins about a month or so ago (unless gox and bitstamp were trending roughly equally).  I couldn't find the information on their site so I really appreciate it.

They're roughly real-time, I think.  When they were based of mt.gox you could open the gox ticker in one window and watch the updates on the coinbase side shortly thereafter, seemed to be from the 'last price' column.

Good to know.  I was aware of other indexes but being somewhat new to this, was unsure of their significance.  The last time I traded, Coinbase mirrored Gox.  Thanks for the update.
