How do you know how to fix this issue or whether has been fixed? 
@_date: 2018-01-05 23:56:37
Seems to me that the only safe option will be to upgrade to a Ryzen cpu.. Even when there has been a software fix it will be a band-aid fix and still vulnerable..

The mark moves on its own accord.. The news just pretends to be relevant 
@_date: 2018-09-25 23:17:39
Yep

Advertising actually works

@_date: 2018-08-05 11:10:09

@_date: 2018-08-29 18:45:14
If it was irrelevant the price would be zero... If you don't like it don't buy it

But 97%of money is created by private banks 
@_date: 2018-08-06 22:25:16
Actually exactly what I did.. 
@_date: 2018-08-13 11:34:46
It's a bubble.. 
@_date: 2018-08-29 18:36:23
It's not going to make it go away..... 
@_date: 2018-05-13 06:35:37
Millennials don't have any money..... 
@_date: 2019-03-25 09:16:53
Do you know how the money for the loan created? 
@_date: 2019-03-28 17:16:14
They still think it's a conspiracy theory 
@_date: 2019-03-28 17:28:47
If I could get my hands on some more funny money I would be all in 
@_date: 2019-03-28 17:23:17
OMG.. this is what I mean ��
@_date: 2019-03-11 09:41:32
Buy gold.. UK sovereign coins are tax free 
@_date: 2019-03-25 01:29:32
Most people I talk to still think money is baked by gold... And laugh at me when I tell them bank loans are new money created by the banks
@_date: 2019-03-27 13:28:31
Do you know how money is created? 
@_date: 2019-03-25 09:17:14
I knew I would get one 
@_date: 2019-03-28 17:11:03
Also had this with an account.. A few links sent through WhatsApp and she went a quiet 
@_date: 2019-03-28 01:04:00
Try telling people that banks create money out of thin air.. They will not believe you 
@_date: 2019-03-25 15:55:02
I would go further and say inflation is pure theft... 
@_date: 2019-03-31 03:04:00
Conformation when stoch rises above the 20 line but sometimes that's to late to get in 
@_date: 2019-03-25 15:56:47
Crypto is not completely immune to inflation new coins will also be created forks etc. 
@_date: 2019-03-28 17:07:15
I tried telling people this in the UK politics sub.. Even provided a link to the bank of England website explaining it in full.... Still disbelief ��
@_date: 2019-03-28 17:05:20
"they create debt but not money"
Tell me, what do you think debt is and where do they get it from? 
@_date: 2018-10-12 15:43:56
Bitcoin holding its level.. Markets still bearish 
@_date: 2018-10-13 00:12:40
Anyone think that bitcoin should never be plural? 
@_date: 2018-10-10 23:29:14
Should go up soon, looks like the stock market is starting to crash 
@_date: 2018-06-13 11:49:42
Turn @ 5000 usd 
@_date: 2019-10-28 21:03:27
Aren't bitcoin forks inflation?
@_date: 2019-10-28 21:34:53
It will happen every
@_date: 2019-10-14 17:29:45
Litecoin better
@_date: 2019-10-17 21:15:11
What recent events? I'm not quite up to date..
@_date: 2019-12-03 02:15:48
I don't think it will go lower than the years low..
@_date: 2019-12-08 21:43:21
If u think its going to zero then go short
@_date: 2019-04-01 19:15:03
Wouldn't be dead at one dollar anyway.. Just really cheap 
@_date: 2019-04-04 00:04:43
I'm not happy till I get my lambo

How much bitcoin do you need to run a node and how much can you earn?
Cheers 
@_date: 2019-01-10 00:31:38
That's great but who gets to own the new created bucks and why? 
@_date: 2018-02-05 01:42:07
I watched it live.....over reacting cry baby.. Nothing but a standard pullback.. Its bouncing of the 61.8 % level at the moment..still in an up trend in my opinion 
@_date: 2019-01-11 01:03:11
How did you draw those curved chanell lines? 
@_date: 2019-01-10 00:32:56
What caused it to level off the last 30 years? 
@_date: 2018-02-05 01:37:39
Reason I think they don't want gold to boom is, Russia and China have been stock piling gold.... 
@_date: 2018-02-05 01:23:33
Nope.... 50k
@_date: 2018-02-05 01:34:11
I'm thinking the same... But I actually think that this is the the reason that the crypto market was created in the first place.. They really don't want the gold markets to boom, so they need an alternative place to offload.
Nasdaq looking very toppie and bitcoin looking very bottomed out at the moment... 
@_date: 2018-07-29 12:07:32
 Good point.. Should be easily spendabbmle 
@_date: 2018-07-05 12:53:02
Everything is what it is until it isn't.... 
@_date: 2018-07-29 12:06:37
Meh.. I'll be 62
@_date: 2018-12-02 16:34:20
Bitcoins sounds stupid af
@_date: 2019-05-26 22:02:47
Fiat currencies won't crash they will just slowly be worth less and less.... As more people understand inflation Bitcoin and crypto will grow... I guess at some stage fiat will become pointless
@_date: 2019-05-19 20:49:53
Not sell
@_date: 2018-12-02 18:40:32
21 bitcoin! ..
 Anyone that uses the plural should be shot!
