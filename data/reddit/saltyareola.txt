I would take a measured approach. Bitcoin has exploded over the past month and there is a lot of new money flooding into bitcoin right now(Ppl who don't know what they are doing but are in fear of missing out on profit). One common saying is to be greedy when others are scared (buy the lows) and be scared when others are greedy (sell the highs). Right now as you can see Bitcoin is at an All Time High. People are very greedy, jumping on the wagon - great for people who have held bitcoin up this point. But for you - with every explosive jump like this there should be a market correction (see Sept 1-15 of this year) which if it happens, would be the optimal time for you to buy in. So if I were you, I would look for that opening - of course, no one knows when, if ever, that will be. Also if you're a super long term believer of Bitcoin, you can just invest whenever and not even look at the charts ever bc you believe it will always net an upward trend.
Also consider that if you hold any bitcoin at the time of the Bitcoin2x fork, you will be given an equal amount of Bitcoin2x coins for free.
The best advice I can give you and you will hear this a lot is to do your research. The more money you are about to put in, the more research you should do. This is to give yourself confidence and peace of mind in the event that something does go wrong - that you made the best choice with the options and resources you had at the time.
Also consider that I am not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice and I am a crypto beginner just like you (started in August)
