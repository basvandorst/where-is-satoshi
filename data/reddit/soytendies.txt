It's inconvenient in some ways. I can't pay for a coffee right now because the fees would be too high.
But moving money across borders is a lot easier with btc.
Also with btc I have sovereignty over my own wealth. In the example you described, you're asking for permission from the bank to transact. 
I don't like asking for consent, and I think once 2nd layer/scaling solutions are commonplace fiat will have even less conveniences in regards to btc.
Banks aren't going to raise interest rates. The current financial system is built on 100% fraud. I don't like it, and more importantly I don't trust the banks, or the current financial system. 
Btc doesn't ask for permission, and I like that.

You've been bitten by one snake too many. 
Btc hasn't even been around for 10 years and you already want it to function as a stable currency.
Nobody knows if it will stabilize around 50k, 100k or 1million.
What is true is that nobody is going back to trusting banks, when I can move my money wherever I want without a central authority's permission.
Your "money laundering" points aren't very good. 
The number one currency used in money laundering is the good ole' US Dollar $$$$$$. It's an anonymous, centralized currencty with no fixed cap and drug cartels love it because they can just HODL it.
Dollars are the devil, drug cartels use them.... ABOLISH ALL DOLLARS&gt;&gt; Oh but wait, I pay my child's tuition in U.S. Dollars, maybe the world isn't black and white?
See your problem is you're looking at the price valuation, and not the underlying technology.
# Nobody is basing their decision on which coin is easier to buy coffee with. The use case for BTC is uncensorable, permisionless, decentralized, borderless, store of value, which Bitcoin wins hands down over anything else.
I don't think you understand the underlying technology, so how about this. If BTC is &lt;$1,000 by 1/17/2019, as punishment I will fuck with my colon and arteries and I'll eat some meat, eggs and dairy.

I meant commercial banks.


There are so many examples, I don't know where to start?
U.S. seeks $2.1 billion from Bank of America in fraud case 
After JPMorgan’s deceitful activities in the housing market helped trigger the 2008 financial crash that cost millions of Americans their jobs, homes, and life savings, punishment was in order. Among a vast array of misconduct, JPMorgan engaged in the routine use of “robo-signing,” which allowed bank employees to automatically sign hundreds, even thousands, of foreclosure documents per day without verifying their contents. 
The fact that the banking system is built on fraud is clear to me. 


Both systems can exist an interact in parallel, but only one of these systems is fraud based.

limit order just means that you'll buy/sell at YOUR price.

A limit order to sell at $1,000,000 will only execute if the price hits $1,000,000.

They report back through seafood products which are a major route of human exposure to microplastics.
As Styrofoam breaks into smaller parts, polystyrene components in it sink lower in the ocean, so that the pollutant spreads throughout the sea column.
In fact, not only do the toxins in plastic affect the ocean, but acting like sponges, they soak up other toxins from outside sources before entering the ocean. As these chemicals are ingested by animals in the ocean, humans ingest contaminated fish and mammals.

Yes I did pick up on your sarcasm. 
You believe dollars are more valuable than bitcoins.
I believe bitcoins are more valuable than dollars.


I don't trust dollars or their issuance. Your chargeback comments again are misinformed because you don't understand bitcoin or the technology. 
In Bitcoin the feature you are looking for is called "escrow". It can be implemented with multiple-sig (2 of 3) in Bitcoin.
In your PayPal example, there is a trusted 3rd party (PayPal.com). Both the sender and receiver trust them to handle disputes, making a human decision to let the receiver keep the money or giving it back to the sender.
Bitcoin doesn't have a trusted 3rd party built into the system, but one can be used at any time. This is called escrow.
In this system, the sender uses multi-sig to send a payment to a destination that needs 2 of 3 signatures to send it to the final destination. the 3 signatures are the sender, the receiver, and the 3rd party (escrow company). The receiver will put the first signature on the transaction that sends the money to himself, but he needs a 2nd signature to receive it. When the sender receives the merchandise in the mail, he can add his signature, which gets the money to the receiver (merchandise seller).
If the sender (merchandise buyer) does not receive the merchandise, he will open a dispute with the escrow company asking for his money back. If the dispute is resolved in his favor, then he and the escrow company sign a transaction the sends the money back to him.
On the other hand, if the seller (receiver) does not receive his bitcoin in a reasonable time, he can also open a dispute with the same 3rd party.


See this just proves you don't know what you're talking about. 
When have "over 1,000,000 bitcoins have been stolen in hacks despite being protected by "immutable" cryptography"?
If you mean bitcoins stolen from Mt. Gox hacks, you're wrong. Bitcoin's cryptography wasn't broken, the centralized exchange was hacked into. Everyone who has ever lost bitcoins in hacks did not control their private keys, which means they didn't own their bitcoins. I'm not sure you understand this concept. 


So then you must have multiple instances of bitcoin's cryptography getting hacked then right?
What are those examples?

Casino games have endings. 
Buying btc and hodling has no ending.
Added with the fact that I've only been investing what I'm willing to lose each month, I don't care if they manipulate the price. In fact I'm hoping they can keep it lower for a couple of months so I can accumulate more.
Remember if you're 100% staying in Fiat, you're also playing the game btw. Fiat in banks let's them leverage our money for risk taking in the stock markets, when they lose we bail them out, printing more dollars and devaluing our own. When they win they get the profits. And when they lose they are too big to fail so they break even, or make profits anyways. I'm done playing that game.
I understand the BTC rules the rules are open source, I like them better than FIAT which has closed source rules, so I'm buying more btc and leaving fiat progressively.
@_date: 2018-05-20 22:55:23
Houses can't be replaced with anything except more $ than what they were worth before. The whole point of a debt based system is everything goes up in price over the long run. 
If you believe 1 btc will be worth less in 5, 10, 15 years then you should short it.
I'll tell you what I know though. While we are debating whether math based currency protocols have value, in about 700 days we're going to have the next Bitcoin Block Reward Halving. So newly "minted" bitcoins will be twice as scarce and all the fools throwing their hard earned dollars at trying to own 1 btc will have 1/2 as much new supply to purchase. 
Bitcoin Block Reward Halving is immutable, but dollar printing/minting is not. And there will never be less dollars in existence in the future than there were before.

You said I was gambling when I bought btc, yet you have no idea what my purchasing strategy is.
Gambling sounds a lot like what you wish it were, I'm assuming you hold no coins?
BTC is deflationary, there is no reason it would inflate because the number of btc asymptotically approaches 21 million. In 2 years the next halvening will happen and half as many bitcoins will be mined per block, and then we'll have another halvening 4 years after that. Deflation.
This is the opposite of fiat, which is just a parabola unbound by asymptotes.
Let me restate this concept. Bitcoin is hard to understand **because** it's at the intersection of 
1. Game Theory
2. Cryptography
3. Computer Networking and Data Transmission
4. Economic and Monetary Theory.  
So when you're criticizing btc you're going to have to criticize the other aspects as well, like encryption and privacy features, scalability issues. It's not just a currency bound by economics. It's an asset, a store of value.. increasingly seen as global hedge precisely because of the way it is.

I never said scarcity is the one thing that gives things value? It's a factor. If gold were everywhere it wouldn't be as valuable. Scarcity is absolutely a factor in determining value. 


42coin's network is not as resistant to attack. 
The cost of a 51% attack against bitcoin right now is $4,961,856,499
(Hardware cost only, at cheapest rate)
The attack would consume 68,225,526 kWh per day (3,411,276$ per day)
Cryptocurrencies are at the intersection of technology, cryptography, economics and finance. I think you have a solid grasp of economic and maybe financial concepts, but you are missing the technology and cryptographic concepts. 
Double-spending has been solved. This is huge.
Everyone who is running a full node is performing a full validation of the blockchain. They are exerting monetary sovereignty. They are not relying on any third party to tell them whether the blockchain is valid or not.That’s what adds a lot of the decentralization of the bitcoin network. Everybody can run the software and validate it themselves.
But getting the historic immutability is absolutely critical. There are no shredders that can destroy evidence like Worldcom and Enron to cover fraud.
You don’t get to do that with bitcoin. You can’t freeze, you can’t confiscate, you can’t chargeback, you can’t do a lot of the things that our current financial system has introduced.
It’s nice to chargeback money to the credit card when there is fraud involved, but that makes the money very soft. It makes it unreliable.
With bitcoin we have the principle of immutability; but not all blockchains are immutable, and not all are secure and if you want to work on a censorship resistant, decentralized, immutable, world reserve currency asset internet protocol, there is no margin for error.
It’s got to be really serious, it can’t be a playground. That’s why bitcoin draws the best of the developers, and if you can’t compete over there, then you would go over to some of the other projects and work on the edges.
42coin doesn't have the best developers. It doesn't attract the best talent.

Your needs to not be anonymous do not translate to the rest of the world, where people live in autocratic dictatorships, or where their government is continually debasing their currency week after week (Venezuela, Argentina.. etc).
Furthermore, you must understand game theory, cryptography, computer networking, data transmission, economic and monetary Theory better than the rest of the world which has looked at bitcoin's code, therefore you should be shorting bitcoin am I right? Because dollars are obviously superior than bitcoins right?
It's not like bank accounts could be frozen at the drop of a hat right?
Oh yes they can.








Try freezing my bitcoin transactions. 
Bitcoin's can't be stolen like dollars out of bank accounts.






This can't happen with bitcoin. 
And before you say that this is all happening outside of the US, and would never happen in the US... let me remind you the entire global financial system is linked. When Greece went under we feel it here. 




So what happens in Italy affects the stock market here. What happens in Greece and China affects the stock market here, because algorithms and high frequency trading are the norm, and we don't have true price discovery anymore.

Again let me go back to my earlier point on how fiat money isn't open source. There is no LAW as to how the Federal Reserve is supposed to operate. There was also nothing in the law that said the banks were too big to fail, these are major concerns. Main street got sold out, wall street got bailed out. 


First off, the laws were written thanks to lobbying on the part of wall street. Just because corporate buy backs are legal, doesn't mean I want to play that game anymore.
In a nutshell, stock repurchases or "buybacks" are just a way for corporations to pay executives and other employees at the stockholder's expense. At first glance it looks like companies are paying money to loyal shareholders when they buy back shares of stock. However, don't forget that companies also give stock options to executives and other employees, and these options end up putting new shares of stock back in to the market. When an executive exercises his stock options, he is essentially getting brand new shares of stock for an older, lower price, and then immediately selling them to the market at the higher current market price.
That's all legal, and it's bullshit.


Might be accepted everywhere but the stability of the dollar is an illusion, otherwise I could buy a Ford for 1922 prices.


BTC is not just a currency, but regardless if you're so sure it's just tulip-mania, then you should short it.

Yes there's overwhelming evidence because we understand how animal products contribute to these preventable diseases through *multiple* physiological mechanisms.
For example, on the topic of mTor signaling t's not just animal flesh that contributes to cancer, but also dairy.
[The impact of cow's milk-mediated mTORC1-signaling in the initiation and progression of prostate cancer.](


On the IGF-1 side all animal products raise IGF-1.  A study comparing meat-eaters to vegans to show that higher IGF-1 levels were only associated with animal protein intake. In fact, plant protein seemed to decrease IGF-1 levels. Animal protein appears to send a much different signal to our livers than most plant proteins. Even vegans eating the same amount of protein as meateaters still had lower levels of the IGF-1, so it’s apparently not about excessive protein in general, but about animal protein in particular.
When you dump a load of protein on your body, your liver’s like whoa, look at all this. What are we going to do with all? We can’t just waste it; we’ve got to do something with it. Let’s just start growing stuff; add a few new additions, maybe a new wing. So your liver decides to start pumping out IGF-1 to tell all the cells in the body, it’s growin’ time! Be fruitful and multiply. Spare no expense, go crazy—look how much excess protein we got to work with!
The problem, of course, is that some of the new additions may be tumors. When you’re a fully grown adult, cell growth is something we want to slow down—not accelerate. So one might imagine the goal would be to maintain adequate, but non-excessive, overall protein intake.
There's a litany of research on igf-1 relationship to animal products.
Carrying on, animal products feed a different kind of gut bacteria than plants do, which shouldn't be too surprising as one is decomposing animal flesh and the other is decomposing plant matter. 




Our “[g]ut microbiota [our gut bacteria microbiome] serve as a filter for our largest environmental exposure—what we eat. Technically speaking, food is a foreign object that we take into our bodies [by the pound] every day.” “And, the microbial community within each of us significantly influences how we experience [those meals].” “Hence, our metabolism and absorption of food occurs through [this] filter of bacteria.”
But, if we eat a lot of meat, poultry, fish, milk, cheese, eggs, we can foster the growth of bacteria that convert the choline and carnitine in these foods into TMA—trimethylamine, which can be oxidized into TMAO, and wreak havoc on our arteries, increasing our risk of heart attack, stroke, and death.
We’ve known about this troublesome transformation from choline into trimethylamine for over 40 years. But, that was way before we learned about the heart disease connection. Why were they concerned back then? Because these methylamines might form “nitrosamines [which] have marked carcinogenic activity”—cancer-causing activity.
So, where is choline found in our diet? Mostly from meat, eggs, dairy, and refined grains. The link between meat and cancer probably wouldn’t surprise anyone. In fact, just due to the industrial pollutants alone (like PCBs), children probably shouldn’t eat more than like five servings a month of meats like beef, pork, or chicken, combined. But, what about cancer and eggs?
Studies going back to the 70s hinted at a correlation between eggs and colon cancer. But, that was just based on so-called ecological data, showing that countries that ate more eggs tended to have higher cancer rates. But, that could be due to a million things, right? It needed to be put to the test.
This started in the 80s, and by the 1990s, 15 studies had been published: ten suggesting “a direct association” between egg consumption and colorectal cancer, and five showing “no association.” By 2014, there were dozens more studies published, confirming that eggs may indeed be playing a role in the development of colon cancer—though no relationship was discovered between egg consumption and the development of precancerous polyps, which suggests that “egg[s] might be involved [more] in the promotional [stage of cancer growth—accelerating cancer growth, rather than] initiating [the cancer in the first place].”
Also cooked animal flesh contains HCAs and PAHs, which are a completely different cancer causing compound than those listed above.
Finally red meat itself contains Neu5gc.
If you take autopsy samples, you can find proof of a molecule called Neu5Gc in human tumors. You can see it stained brown here in human breast cancer, melanoma, ovarian cancer, brain tumors.
Now, this mystified researchers, because human beings are “genetically unable to produce” this substance. But, other animals can. Maybe, the researchers proposed, human beings absorbed it from eating other animals.
Well, to test this, because it’s found in animals and animal products, the researchers had to first eat vegan for a few days to clear their system (no animal-derived ingredients in foods or drugs or shampoo), and then they basically drank a glass of diluted pig mucous.
And, within days, this invading meat molecule could be found oozing from their bodies, in their saliva, urine—even their hair clippings. “Because [Neu5Gc-type compounds] are not found in plants, and Neu5Gc is not synthesized by microbes, the dietary source of Neu5Gc must be foods of animal origin…” The metabolic incorporation of this “molecular ‘Trojan horse’”, if you will, from animal products, may possibly be contributing to the higher rates of cancer and heart disease among meat-eaters.
This is what they think may be happening. Comes into our mouths from animal products in our diet, incorporates itself into our cells, leading to chronic inflammation directly, and the formation of antibodies—which can then lead back to more inflammation, which may partially explain the increased risk of cancer and heart disease noted in those consuming animal products.
“In contrast, vegetarianism decreases the risk of cancer…and heart disease…” Although saturated fat in meat and dairy products is the usual explanation” for that fact, maybe we should start looking into the association between Neu5GC and the incidence of both cancer and ischemic heart disease.
In conclusion these are 5 of the mechanisms that are clearly understood right now: 
1. mTor
2. IGF-1
3. Gut bacteria
4. HCAs and PAHs
5. Neu5gc.
This is only on the cancer side by the way. Type 2 diabetes and Heart disease are also treatable and reversible with plant based diets.

Ok, from that article:




The one thing they call into question is Juice fasts, which may have a lot of sugar which feeds cancer cells, but still they don't know if this is the reason he died. 


Regardless, the Doctor in the story recommends a largely plant based diet for cancer, so the vegetables aren't the issue here. 


Plant based diets are extremely effective at fighting and preventing cancer because they decrease the input from upstream pathways like Neug5c, HCAs and PAHs and even including insulin growth factors (such as IGF-1 and IGF-2), which coincidentally are integrated by mTOR and are directly linked to the pancreatic cancer Jobs had. 


So the argument that he refused treament for the cancer is false (he had surgery), and the claim that his diet played in his death is unsubstantiated.
* We know that Steve Jobs was 56 when he died (tumour would have been at least 10cm in size to kill him) and 48 when his pancreatic cancer was detected. Therefore using simple mathematics we know that his cancer cells had a doubling rate of 10 months. This is considered a slow doubling rate or a slow growing cancer. A fast growing cancer would have a doubling rate of 3-5 months.
* By knowing this doubling rate and using the same simple mathematics you can reasonably assume that Steve Jobs first developed cancer in his early 20’s. Probably around 24 (see Dr McDougall’s newsletter for an explanation of how doubling rates are calculated).
Similar calculations also show that his pancreatic cancer metastasized (spread) to his liver over 20 years before his surgery in July 2004.
* In 2008 it was abundantly clear to the medical team that the cancer was spreading throughout his body.
* In April 2009 Steve Jobs had a liver transplant.
* In July 2011 it was clear cancer had spread to his bones. His doctors declared there was nothing else they could do for him.
* Steve Jobs died on the 5th October 2011.
Steve Jobs cancer was detected in 2003. He waited 9 months before agreeing to surgery. As stated in his biography: “I really didn’t want them to open my body, so I tried to see if a few other things would work”
When he died in 2011 he believed that his decision to delay his surgery for 9 months cost him his life. Can you imagine dying with that regret and guilt?
The media still portrays the decision by Steve Jobs to delay his surgery as irresponsible and stupid. It’s seen as the leading factor for why Steve Jobs died. In reality, by the time his cancer was detected it was already too advanced for any medical intervention.
Despite the overwhelming evidence showing the protective benefits of plant based diets, the media still ridicules Steve Jobs’s dietary preferences. But the fact of the matter is that the type of diet he was following ultimately enabled him to live with pancreatic cancer for more than 30 years
 
@_date: 2018-06-23 03:51:29
He regretted not getting the surgery sooner (he waited 9 months) but as I detailed in another comment, these 9 months were unlikely to be the reason he died. 
Steve Jobs getting cancer was an unfortunate accident—like being struck by lightning or hit by a car. The carcinogens entered his body and due to genetics, “bad luck,” or other unknown and uncontrollable factors his body was susceptible. The cause of his cancer was not due to his vegan diet. In fact, his healthy diet likely slowed the growth of his tumour, delayed the time of diagnosis, and prolonged his useful life. 
From the latest scientific research we know that plant based diets can help to prevent, slow and even reverse cancer (2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15). It is generally believed that plant based diets are so effective in reducing cancer risks as these type of diets contain high amounts of antioxidants (16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21), they contain high amounts of fibre (22), they reduce methionine levels (23, 24) and they help prevent angiogenesis (25, 26, 27). Countries and populations that focus their diets around plants have dramatically lower rates of cancer (28, 29, 30, 31).

Btc is nothing like gambling. There is a new supply of btc created everday, and that amount is constantly decreasing. Which means that every 10minutes the price stays at 3500, the market is absorbing that new supply of btc. We are currently at 12.5 btc per 10 minute block, which means people worldwide are buying 45k worth of btc at that moment (assuming it's stays at 3500).  
There is no gambling game like this, based on computer networks, game theory, cryptography.. economics.

Bitcoin *requires* criticism, and because it's open source and voluntary if there's something you believe strongly in then you can fork the chain and others can voluntarily choose to mine your chain.  
But the fact of the matter is, how many people actually understand applied cryptography? How many critics are talking about if or when we should change the cryptographic algorithim from Elliptic-curve cryptography (ECC) (an approach to public-key cryptography based on the algebraic structure of elliptic curves over finite fields) to an algorithm that's quantum resistant?
Bitcoin is antifragile, and this is a hard concept for many to understand. Antifragility is a property of systems that increase in capability, resilience, or robustness as a result of stressors, shocks, volatility, noise, mistakes, faults, attacks, or failures.
We need that criticism so we can vote on Bitcoin Improvement Protocols and *improve* the system, the whole world is listening and watching. There's eyes on this thing 24/7, but the issue mainstream criticism is "Btc is crashing", "Btc is volatile" it's a "Ponzi", and my "Tulips".

Stopping bitcoin by banning the internet is not a permanent solution and doesn't cover all your bases. The only thing it will do is strengthen the resilience of other methods for transacting with the network. 
There are less common channels such as private microwave connections amateur radio repeaters, pager networks and satellites could also provide such resilience. 
But there are many other options. A Brooklyn-based company GoTenna, is collaborating with Samourai Wallet, a bitcoin wallet focused on privacy and security, on an app dubbed TxTenna that allows users to exchange bitcoin when not connected to the web.
Samourai Wallet has some special features like the ability to enter a direct interaction with trusted nodes, added hops to circumvent chain analysis, and SMS commands for remotely wiping wallets. It has seen widespread adoption by users wishing to incorporate an additional level of privacy into their Bitcoin transactions. The goTenna device costs $179 per pair and allows users to access a mesh network and send data **without the need for Internet connection.**
The app will enable users to pair their smartphones with goTenna’s portable antennas in order to send transactions.


What next? The hypothetical tyrannical government is going to stop electricity from running in the country because people are using their phones to send btc?

You and I are literally in the same boat. Same exact situation, except I wired it maybe 6 weeks ago.
I've emailed Gemini's bank... no luck. Now I'm going to call the bank. Try giving Silvergate a shout and see if that works... otherwise you and I should exchange details later on and go in on a class action lawsuit.
My bank (Wells Fargo) has contacted Silvergate 4 separate times to return the wire with no response.

 I'll tell you why it's not a scam. In my opinion, all right? hash goes in, lambos go out. Never a miscommunication
Why not both and neither? 
Think of monotremes.. now think of sporks. And what about magnets.. what's their deal? 
You can't explain that.

You can't dig yourself out of this cringe hole you duck.. you'll just keep finding more basements.

Ya give me 3 minutes, I need to go to the store to buy AA batteries for my camera because my dog ate the last roll of polaroid film I had.

You think you're high income but u are a small fries duck debating "teenagers" on the internet.
Regardless, your basement meme jokes are giving me ulcers. Are you trying to be hip? Basement meme jokes are not hip, this isn't 2004. 
Oh you don't care about trends and YOU are the trend setter, so you'll say whatever you think is funny? That's the definition of dad jokes. 
I'm cringing so hard in my basement right now.

If you're investing in bitcoin, you're tipping the scale in favor of more transparent systems as opposed to fiat, which is the direct lifeline for the banking and military cartels you love so dearly. 
I'd say it's the most ironic thing I've read all day, but Chris Christie eats the cake today.

This isn't my area of expertise, you might want to consult with Master Splinter.

We can lend money through the blockchain. I'm not following this as closely but there's ethlend for example, and WeTrust (TRST).
The entire point is decentralized cryptocurrencies and their associated platforms make traditional banking obsolete.

I did try that once, but the Red Bull gave them irregular heart rhythms. Then some of them were complaining Red Bull isn't fair trade or organic, so we all agreed to switch to coffee.

Yes I get calls from Google all the time to update my business listing for a low price of $599. To some it seems like a steep price, but if you invested from the start in solid coins like onecoin, s-coin and earth coin you should have plenty of cash to spend.

Actually I'm not impotent anymore. I do admit it was affecting my relationship with my wife. Long nights of not being able to please her. Losing steam halfway through. It's hard. I mean it wasn't hard, but the situation was hard. 
Then a few years ago that [penile arteries are only about half the size of the coronary arteries in the heart and doctors are increasingly using erectile dysfunction as a possibly powerful predictor for future cardiac events, and sudden cardiac-death.](
This scared the shit out of me. I had already bought the vanity license plate for the lambo. 
I knew I had to do something especially after watching [What the Health]( on Netflix so I revamped my diet. 
So no I'm not impotent anymore.. and to answer your next question: Yes, that is a banana in my pants, but I'm also pretty hard about my crypto investments.

And on a related note... what do Gemini and Poloniex say on this issue.
@_date: 2017-06-20 18:59:44
I'm attempting to recall it through my bank. 
It's weird. I like Gemini, and I still use them.. but this wire issue is fucking crazy.

Thanks we were wondering when you were going to stop reading. It's hard to tell if you don't let us know after every comment. 
@_date: 2017-06-28 14:58:04
Well then reading is probably not your forte.
