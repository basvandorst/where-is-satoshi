I got passed down some beanie babies and two emu eggs from my parents. I get it, you want to share your nutty life with your kids. I still treasure my beanie baby retirement plan from my parents. Do it no matter what happens, they’ll love the reminder of the time if nothing else.

Says the guy who would still be making the Apple II (now in version IIzzz with every port ever made in the history of computing) if he could.

I guess you just have to pick a road. No rules, independent, and open to everyone to do anything, or are you now saying there should be people / groups that are excluded and can't participate? Sounds a lot like a walled garden you're suggesting. If so, who gets in the wall? What are your break points? And if the goal is to create stability, that would make this whole thing way less interesting to invest as stability would keep prices the same. The only way prices go up if there is another sucker.. ahem, I mean speculator, that is willing to pay more to get a coin. For everyone to make money, there can be no end (meaning no loser) to that speculation. Otherwise, it's really just musical chairs and hoping the music doesn't end and you're on your butt. Let's face it, someone downstream is going to pay someone for their prosperity at the cost of their own. This is a pretty big pyramid that bitcoin created, so woudn't expect it to crumble soon. Especially when the people you're talking about know they have the capital and experience to play these speculators for a profit for some time.

Just an update, we already have 3 investors committed and this is NOT a pure mining business. Will be happy to fill in details for interested parties. Thanks for considering! 
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:46:05
Might be able to let you live on the mining site! Los Angeles is great this time of year :)

Yeah using a criminal scammer as inspiration isn't the right message. If this is some kind of heavy sarcasm, it's difficult to tell from the title.

Would say more, but this is just an evil troll so I won't waste any more time. Dammit! I just wasted time writing that I'm wasting time. Damn I did it again. Damn damn damn.
@_date: 2018-08-13 21:27:47
Hmm. ok, well it could go about any direction. It really depends on how useful the damn thing can be. If BitCoin and Eth are useful and gain adoption and increase demand and users, it will be successful. If the whole point is to pyramid scheme some investment dollars, it's in real trouble and probably over already.

If a developer can make something that worth while, what he need you for? Unless they're going to shill you out of some cash for nothing. Figure it out yourself or it's pretty darned worthless.

Never seen anyone outside a campaign speech say so much and communicate so little. This is 100&amp; hyperbole and bluster without an ounce of substance. Assumption built upon another assumption so carelessly he doesn't even put a coherent sentence together. Con men do these kinds of false equivalency arguments all the time. 
Plus.. THE TIE IS KILLING ME! Get a clip on dude. Gotta be a suit he got for his buddy's wedding that's being repurposed over and over and over.

Eesh. Much luck to you, that’s a big roll of the dice!
@_date: 2019-04-19 20:52:23
Haha.  Good one.

Yeah not much of a publication if you can't have an editor go over the HEADLINE.
@_date: 2018-03-07 18:58:54
Thanks for the share. I sincerely hope these companies run toward regulation, rather than away from it. Legitimizing the business will only help it grow the right way and cut scams / illegal activity down significantly. 
@_date: 2018-03-30 16:05:21
If you want to get paid $1000 per week... oh wait I mean $1500 per week! Oh wait, no, now it's $50 per week! Then yes, get paid in coins. 
@_date: 2018-02-24 20:47:57
That isn't what they're saying. Mercy that's some spin right there. Shameful hucksters that write crappy articles for self promotion. 
@_date: 2018-02-09 18:41:14
Just assuming it’s an illegal business then from the secrecy and popularity of paying with crypto. Those businesses do benefit greatly from it. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 20:23:28
I'm happy you're enthusiastic, but since you're a bitcoin  trader, this really just seems like self-interest and manipulation. I understand the only way traders make money on bitcoin is to sell it to the next sucker in line and hope to not be the last sucker. However, these kinds of articles that hype the con seem to be adding salt in a wound. 
@_date: 2018-02-09 23:36:52
Seems logical, they don't need another fine in a year or so for money laundering through bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 20:05:42
Oh yeah, you're so right. When Mt. Gox went up in smoke, the blockchain came and insured everyone and made sure they got all their money back. 
@_date: 2018-02-07 02:26:56
I'm being trolled by this.. I will not succumb to this temptation to respond. Oh no, I just succumbed by writing this! Thiel TROLLLLLLLLLS!!!!
@_date: 2018-02-17 17:30:15
You know you don’t have to use a bank and participation is optional right? And btc solves nothing, zero problems solved. Nothing. Peace and love peace and love but bitcoin isn’t going to fix anyone’s problems in the world. 
@_date: 2017-10-21 01:33:29
Holy scamaroni.. bet he gets some suckers rom his fast talk jargon chatter.
