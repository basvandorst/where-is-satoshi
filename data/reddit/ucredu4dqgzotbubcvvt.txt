I like tails and tor because they are tools that people in repressive regimes can count on if they want to speak their mind with out the fear of being killed next morning. Without tor Edward Snowden would not have been able to blow the whistle on the nsa and revile their massive surveillance programs. 
I use tor and tails because I'm upset with the United States governments unchecked mass surveillance and companys selling my private data.

Oh OK thanks.
@_date: 2017-10-24 10:48:14
OK I like this thank you!

Thanks for the links. They were helpful.

But I assume that that load doesn't fall on 1 point in the network and that the load is distributed across the entire  network.
