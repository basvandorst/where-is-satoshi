Maybe it could serve as a safer alternative to paper wallets if you don't trust your own computer environment. IMO it's overpriced though.

I see nothing confirmed in this article. If they have or haven't the private keys is not stated anywhere. Nonetheless, even if they haven't found the private keys, they have the criminals in jail, who must know the private keys.

Invalid = not accepted by miners
@_date: 2019-11-14 08:19:55
Every invalid transaction will be automatically cancelled after a while. The problem here is probably that the core wallet will automatically rebroadcast the tx again and again. You have to start the wallet with the ‘-zapwallet’ command line option to stop this.

I'm in the SEPA banking area and it did work for me. As they are also servicing the SWIFT area, it should work for everyone. Where are you from? Using their service was easy for me, just sign on, their website is really easy to navigate. Don't hesitate to ask if something is still unclear!
@_date: 2019-08-08 14:07:18
If you're not afraid of KYC procedures, use a decent exchange like [kraken.com]( You first have to convert your SEK to EUR because there is no BTC/SEK trading pair but that is easy. Volume of BTC/EUR is big enough on Kraken, so you shouldn't have any problems trading your desired amount (after completing the required KYC steps).

Look at Warren Buffet f.e., he still has no clue about Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-08-29 12:24:13
The public key is for receiving payments. You can give it to anybody who want to send you some crypto coins (or assets, tokens, whatever).
The private key is for spending your coins, that’s why you should keep it a secret and store it safely.

Thanks for the tips, guys! Highly appreciated! ��

Epic fail. I would feel sorry for this guy but maybe he got back into Bitcoin later on and is now a millionaire?
@_date: 2019-08-02 13:56:30
If you would stay in crypto and HODL there would be no problem IMO. The same for trading between various crypto currencies. The main problem would be to convert your crypto to/from fiat.

Ich denke, man muss denen eine Chance geben. Mit steigendem Volumen werden die die Gebühren schon bald senken können.
Was den Spread angeht: gegen den aktuellen Kurs bei Kraken sehe ich bei einer Stichprobe lediglich einen Aufschlag von 0,12%, damit kann ich leben.

This is an interesting device, but I wouldn't store a big amount on it. This is from their FAQ:






@_date: 2019-08-16 06:10:09
You can’t. 1 Bitcoin will ever be 1 Bitcoin.

Yes, a system that enables trustless peer-to-peer exchange of value over the internet would be awesome.

I'm praying that the real Satoshi will never be found and his million Bitcoins remain untouched forever.
@_date: 2016-12-23 16:55:28
No I think they aren't only saying this so they can't get sued by angry customers. Like every electronic device, it can fail, and the longer you keep your bitcoins on it, chances of hardware failure will rise. This is a real threat. I wouldn't trust my trezor more than a few satoshis if I hadn't my paper backup with the 24 words seed!
So I see a very limited use case for this device: keep the bitcoin amount low and the duration between storing and redeeming short, this should be best practice for such a device. For this use case it can be quite interesting.
@_date: 2019-08-09 05:52:03
Correct. No need for escrow though if you meet in person. The mycelium app makes sure the seller has the Bitcoins in his wallet, he/she sends it when the buyer hands out the cash. Worked for me several times without any problems.

I think it depends on which version their core clients are using.
On second thought (and a quick look at the wiki page) I don't think that they are using SPV. It seems that they are running their own bitcoin nodes (named "super nodes") to which their mobile wallet apps directly connect.

I’d recommend to buy some. If you want them for free, watch out for crypto airdrops. There are a lot of crypto projects out there which gives out their coins for free and you can exchange them to Bitcoin easily. But be aware that there are a lot of scammers around in crypto world, so be careful.
@_date: 2016-10-31 07:23:30
Why not? I still call 12 witnesses chosen by the wallet users a decentralized consensus algorithm. This is new tech without blockchain or proof-of-work, so the developer had to come up with something originally. My opinion is that this can work out well!
