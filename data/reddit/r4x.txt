I'm going to use Google Wallet, Skrill and good old hard cash. I've been on the fence about ditching them for 2 years and this is the tipping point.

I give you 3 days before eBay bends you over and goat fucks you. Then PayPal will limit your account, make you sign an affidavit that you won't do it anymore, then provide your business documents, your bank statements and purpose of your business before they will remove those limits. 
Source: this happened to me. I kindly told them to fuck themselves and am not using eBay / PayPal anymore.

I am taking measures to mitigate any surprises. I have an awesome bank and am doing everything possible to avoid that.

Site seems totally sketchy and scammy, but it turns out it's actually legit.

I used to hate tiger direct. Really I did. You guys have turned it all around recemtly and have won my business. My last transaction has been a great success. Ordered some mining cards on Sunday and got them yesterday even though Monday was a holiday. Good show! Welcome to my bookmarks!

This may or may not be true. TBH, I am not an attorney and do not speak legalese. The only real reply I have to your statement is that they can do it with someone else's money then. I pulled my cash out and removed my bank account and debit card. Next on the chopping block, ebay. That will be harder since they're going to want to charge me seller's fees.

I have a job. And good insurance.
