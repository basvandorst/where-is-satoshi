This has come at a fascinating time. Just this morning I was reading these tweets that are *very* relevant to this post.
Willy Woo:
(imo a master of the charts and has a deep understanding of the fundamentals behind bitcoin)
Cole Garner (effectively elaborating on Willy Woo's comments)
Small miners will begin to capitulate under the pressure of low priced BTC, coupled with their software beginning to become obsolete. They're left with no choice but to liquidate their BTC, as they become cash-strapped, so expect some severe volatility coming to a market near you ;)

Bitcoin is the AOL of the internet. It has birthed a new age in our financial system which is fantastic, but sadly we are likely to see it die a slow death as more efficient, user-friendly and - perhaps most importantly - government-friendly crypto is brought in. 
Anybody who thinks the entire financial system as we know it can be brought down by a few million speculators/libertarians/hopium-huffers are in for a sorry surprise.
IF we need to change the system, you best believe it comes from the top down. Always has, always will. I hate it, but in life you gotta roll with the punches.
Also just take 20 seconds to sit back and consider what a $1M bitcoin would infer - the top 100 addresses (i.e. random people) elevated to be some of the richest and most powerful people in the world? No. Not gonna happen. The worldwide wealth inequality alone should be enough to make people reconsider the idea that bitcoin may one day become "the global currency".
As of right now, it serves no purpose other than to make a few lucky early adopters and clever traders incredibly wealthy. Once the opportunity to exploit the volatility of the market dies, so will bitcoin.
Bring on the negative karma, no idea if you can go below zero but I'm sure I'll find out soon. Do your worst Reddit :)
