Sure, I bet you could get some clients. You aren't really offering people something they can't get on their own, but if you are good at self marketing you might be able to find people who would appreciate your guidance.

No, they offer people who don't know anything about bitcoin and easy path to purchasing it and they charge a fee. So instead of buying from you people can just buy from coinbase.
Your idea is good, its just that someone else has already done it.

That's basically what coinbase is doing.

Brilliant article.

Totally makes sense. One thing to consider is that it is probably illegal to offer yourself as a personal investor for people. As long as you are just doing a little bit for friends and family then I can't see any way you would be affected, but I'm bet you are still supposed to be licensed in some way by the SEC.
The other thing to consider is taxes. Paying taxes on crypto investments is ill defined and difficult. A lot of us simply ignore the IRS. But if you are telling people 'I'll take car of this for you' then they are going to expect you to handle the tax portion. Sounds like a pain in the neck.
If your goal is just to develop some capital so that you can profit off the rise of crypto -- a very noble and worthwhile goal -- then you might try just looking for work at one of the many crypto job sites like 
Not all jobs in crypto have to be technical. A lot of ICOs also offer bounties for getting the word out about the ICOs. Basiclaly you get paid for tweeting. It's not going to be much money, but if the ICO takes off then it can turn into something nice.

I've always found coinbase to be great, but if you really want to keep it private you need to meet someone in person and buy bitcoins from them. Alternatively you might have a bitcoin ATM in your city. 
If you use an ATM or buy it from a person you will need to install a bitcoin wallet on your phone (assuming that is where you want the money to be). Personally I would use Jaxx.
But the _easiest_ thing to do is to head over to coinbase, create an account and buy from them. They are making a ton of money with their business model, so it seems really unlikely that they would turn criminal and start stealing everyone's wealth. They envision a future in which they are the paypal/bank of america of the crypto world. They won't just throw that opportunity away by stealing your identity.

It's almost impossible. Focus on learning the history of bitcoin so you understand how we got here. Then you can read headlines and quickly  ow what's going on

For real? So, unless you dad is super, super computer savvy he probably did not buy bitcoins several years ago. 8 years ago is when bitcoin launched and there were no nice websites or anything like that. He probably would have had to mine them, or buy them in person from someone.
But just for the sake of argument lets say he did buy some bitcoin right when it was launched. I can only guess at how much, but they would certainly be worth tens of millions to hundreds of millions of dollars. 
But remember, he is almost certainly wrong about this.
Now, the hard part. You can't just prove "this is me" with an email or something. He needs his account and his private key. If you are really, really sure this is for real, then you need to find some people you really trust, promise them a percentage of the findings and basically start spending money finding and cracking his account. It might not even be possible.
But again, this didn't happen. I would start by asking "Dad, who did you buy them from? How did you do it?"

It doesn't work that way. Some people think it will rise. Some think it will fall.
Most of us think we don't know what will happen.

Decentralization will eventually drive them out of business. Why would they help dig their own graves, even if those graves aren't getting filled for a decade?
