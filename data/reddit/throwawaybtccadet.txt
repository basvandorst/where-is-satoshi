I just can't wrap my head around why is anyone willing to pay 0.5 BTC or more for what is essentially a slow growing 20 Mhash mining bond. Their website is very non-professional, and their mining setup, [well...](
I heard about them in Several people there seem to think that they're the next "big thing". I don't know why. They seem to be very popular though, so I'm probably missing something.

My favorite is [Enhancing Trader Performance]( a fantastic, easy-to-read book, very thorough but not too heavy on the technical side. I also did my best in understanding [this one]( that is supposed to be the bible of technical analysis, but I wasn't able to finish it or understand all of it. It is an excellent reference, though.
For the lazy, I strongly recommend following [Goomboo's Journal]( at Bitcointalk, who gives excellent, sober and well-written daytrading tips.
