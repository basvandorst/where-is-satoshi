Great. That should do the trick then. Did you enter a old-enough birth time for that key? Something like:
  key1.birth = "1378500000"
? It's unix time.
It should be easy to figure out if you're a dev, let me know if you need any sort of help!
It's quite exciting to see other people use one's code..

Hi. You need to run it once like this:
  # ./bitc -z
That'll make your tx show up. Ttyl, am in the bus right now.

Note that I actually started to port the code so that it can be compiled on windows a while back, but I stopped after I realized that this was taking too much time. There's a chance I'll resurrect this eventually.

Thank you!

FWIW I just fixed item  bitc now asks you to enter the (new) password twice and checks they're both the same before encrypting the wallet.

Duly noted. It's up there in my todo list:

No problem. Please report here if you see anything fishy!
@_date: 2014-02-08 22:39:34
It's a very good point about the password. I'll fix this shortly and I'll also take a look at this backspace issue. Thanks for the feedback, I'm glad you like it and that it works for you! Cheers.

I did! Many thanks!

It looks like this:

It should, but note that 1378500000 was just an example of a key I have in my wallet. You should put the appropriate unix birth time for your key. Once that's done, and you resync your wallet via ./bitc -z it should show the proper balance.

It's possible. What kind of commands would you like it to support?
@_date: 2014-02-08 23:33:03
Btw, it seems that there's interest to develop other front-ends for bitc, so I'll probably start on the implementation of the server-side functionality for RPCs.

I almost drove there.. I certainly wish there was one in Lausanne.
From your description, it sounds most useful for newbies that want to discover what this bitcoin thing is all about. Are there any meetups with developers interested in bitcoin in the area?
