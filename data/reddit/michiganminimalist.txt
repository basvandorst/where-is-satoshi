Heck, when someone tips me a couple cents worth of BTC I still instantly put it into a private wallet. Even with mere pennies (I have a whopping $3.40 worth of BTC to my name) I don't trust online wallets. It stumps me why others would put trust in it...  Transfer your coins to offline private wallets people!

Yeah, I'm getting excited watching it climb. Sadly I became recently unemployed or else I would have bought $20-30 worth and saw where it went in the future. 
@_date: 2013-11-15 00:11:17
Heck yeah. 
@_date: 2013-11-03 06:34:52
Hell, the lazy people that couldn't be bothered to accept can send them my way. I will gladly take the time to accept them. 
It blows my mind that people are that lazy. 
Edit: I'd also love to make friends with the person that have the $7200 tip. Anyone know the story behind that one?

Can I haz internet millionaire?

Holy crap dude.  Thanks a TON!  You really didn't need to.

If I wasn't currently unemployed after busting my ass for seven years on the railroad, I would most likely buy some bitcoin, but since I have recently begun having trouble with just purchasing food, and paying rent, I will just have to live with the whopping 0.00021443BTC in my wallet (yes, that's right, $0.05 US). 
Honestly thinking about just giving the rest away and calling it quits at this point. 
Hopefully once I become employed again I can buy a couple BTC, but that may be a while.  150 applications later, and only two bites, of which I was told I was overqualified for.

Might as well just send it to me before some hacker takes it all from you...  18MTVPxHA9KhZv9GEEeJCvtwQC3F3LeT5U

I did, but it was removed by glassdoor. It wasn't much worse than what I posted here, but they quickly removed it for some reason.  It is this company if you are curious:   they still owe me nearly $6,000 for hours worked that I was never paid (they often did not pay us overtime as required by law, and instead would not pay us at all, or just pay us the regular rate when we worked over 40 hours). Luckily I documented everything, got a judgement against them, but they still have not paid after three months. 
This whole section on their website is quite funny:
'FRA problems? NSC is your solution!!!
National Signal Corp. specializes in clearing up FRA violations. We will send a qualified and experienced team to evaluate your railroad, determine your existing issues, and provide you with a free consultation and our estimate. NSC has bridged the gap between the FRA and many railroads by bringing the railroads back into compliance. We also offer a full-time maintenance service or hands-on training for your employees. Contact us today to learn more.'
The way they clear up the violations is by putting bandaid fixes on railroad crossings and then forcing their employees to falsify the forms to say that everything works properly and is safe...  When they get busted by the FRA (they have a couple times), they claim it must have just happened, or it was vandalism, and it normally gets them off Scott-free. But the last time the FRA dude was here before I got canned, he was asking questions, and it was clear he knew what was up. 
All I gotta say is that there are several railroad crossings in Michigan (Saginaw, Bay City, Grand Rapids, Genesee, and Muskegon) that are horribly unsafe for motorists.

Hell, I will never in my life own even a single BTC. I have .1 :(. My dreams of owning one, actual, real bitcoin are ruined!  
To make matters worse, I was recently run over by an inattentive driver while riding my bicycle and fighting with his insurance is hell.  Dead broke.  Life is really beginning to suck. 
Oh well. Just one more dream shattered. I should have jumped on the bitcoin train when it was affordable.  I have a thing for whole numbers.  Having a fraction of a BTC drives me OCD mind up a freaking wall. 
@_date: 2013-11-15 00:09:34
Yup, as I said before, just send it to me.  I will take better care of those BTC...  I will even make it easy for you!  18MTVPxHA9KhZv9GEEeJCvtwQC3F3LeT5U

Same here!
@_date: 2013-11-14 04:05:13
Can I get in on this tipping train?  I used to work on the railroad... Choo choo! 
@_date: 2013-11-03 16:38:37
Damn. That would have come in handy.

I was a signals and communications engineer.
I loved the day work itself, but hated the company politics, and the 24/7/365 on call (even while on my week of paid vacation I was forced to go out and help repair stuff at a moments notice).  
They finally got rid of me when I refused to falsify federal paperwork that would have said something was safe when it was not.  If I would have falsified it, my name would have been signed on the dotted line, and if the FRA inspector found out, I could have had a few years in federal prison.  Instead, I refused, and reported the violation to the government so I would be protected under the whistleblower act.  It didn't do much good, they still got rid of me the day after I did that. 
They still haven't filled the position, and they currently have a guy driving 160 miles each way every day, plus any emergency calls (which come in 4-5 times a week) to do the job. 
Like I said I loved the work, not the politics and how the company treated employees.

Hell, I would be perfectly happy with $25 worth of bitcoin. I have a whopping $0.26 and since I don't have a bank account, or money for that matter (after becoming unemployed for reporting my employer to the Feds for violating MAJOR federal laws) I can't find an easy way to purchase a couple dollars in bitcoin. 
I must say, it is quite exciting watching my wallet grow by just a measley $0.03 each day after spending a bit of free time on bitvisitor, but I doubt I'll ever earn enough to actually buy something with bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-11-02 14:52:25
Freaking thanks!
@_date: 2013-11-05 05:06:26
Hell, in the rare chance someone here on reddit tips me a couple cents, I instantly transfer it from blockchain.info to an offline wallet.  I only have a whopping $3 worth, but I treat that like gold.  
@_date: 2013-11-01 16:14:36
Thanks a ton. You really didn't need to, but I definitely appreciate it. Hopefully it grows someday when bitcoin really takes off.

I have heard about it in the past, but when I looked into it, everything seemed so daunting. 
After seeing the article on the front page tonight, I decided to figure this whole bitcoin thing out. I set up a wallet, someone tipped me a couple cents, and I am actually learning how to use it. 
Do I expect to get rich like the dude in the article? Hell no (heck, I only have $0.17 in my wallet and I doubt I will ever get it much higher than a couple dollars), but I feel like at least looking into this new form of currency is helping us get away from all the issues of mainstream currency in some small way. 
Just wish I could figure out how to mine, or earn a bit more in the wallet. It's all still confusing to me!
@_date: 2013-11-13 19:39:18
Crazy isn't it?  I I could be in the internet I would imagine it would just be redditors walking around tossing money, er, bitcoin on the ground.  You don't see this kind of generosity often out in the real world. 
Edit: I have no clue what I just said or why I said it.  Random ramble about tossing money on the ground ftw! I have been doing that often, even in the real world, over the past week since I got run over by a car (who ran a red) while I was on my bicycle. I feel fine, but people have been saying I am rambling stuff that is vaguely on-topic but mostly off topic. Maybe I should go back to the hospital.
