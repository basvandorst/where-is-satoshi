How about pen-drives? I know it's not the best. But is it possible to use as a cold wallet?
@_date: 2019-07-30 10:30:33
My intention is to buy for a while and hold it. Unless an exception happens, I don't intend to keep buying/selling (short trading I guess, still new to those terms).
Instead, I would like to buy from time to time or when the price falls or something like that. So I guess I can buy and send to my address?

That's a great suggestion, thank you very much.
I'm a software engineer, so I guess I won't have much trouble dealing with it, or at least, I'll have fun while having trouble hahaha
About the daily spending, do you mean buying stuff with BTC? Or buying/selling BTC?
@_date: 2019-07-29 22:58:11
I don't have any BTC yet. I started studying it this week to start, so I wouldn't by the hardware right away. The pen-drive would be used solely for that purpose and only to hold as backup before I have everything correct.
I ask that because I once saw someone that uses bitcoin for a long time and always recommend and told about the pen-drive as a cold wallet, but after that I never saw any mention. I thought there would be a software for that at the time, but I'm completely clueless.

My bank don't allow me to transfer to any account related to cryptos. They say they're related to cyber crimes. I can still do it but it requires a bank employee, so I had to find another way of doing so, to make it fast.

Lower than Coinbase Pro?
@_date: 2019-08-29 19:23:47
Ah, essa opção é pra comprar direto com eles? Ah, então não quero não hahaha
Me falaram de mbway pro Revolut e de lá pro CB. Vou agilizar isso então.
Mas do Revolut pro CB é como? SEPA? Porque CB Pro não aceita cartão né e CB normal tem taxas altas.
@_date: 2019-08-29 19:04:50
É só transferir como uma SEPA normal então?
@_date: 2019-08-29 18:47:19
Activo Bank. Desde ontem tendo problema. Hoje liguei e informaram que Coinbase Pro está na blacklist deles por envolver bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-08-29 17:25:33
Had teh same problem today with Activo. I had to make the SEPA via phone. It's complete bullshit. Portuguese banks are crap and live in the last century. And I say that as someone that used to work in their IT.
@_date: 2019-08-29 17:26:08
Eita, isso é uma ótima solução. Existe alguma invite pra Revolut?
@_date: 2019-08-29 17:23:19
Great news. Now my portuguese bank just need to not blacklist companies related to Bitcoin like they did with Coinbase Pro u\_u
@_date: 2019-08-29 19:30:05
CB Pro só aceita SEPA mas tem taxas menores que o CB normal. É o que sempre recomendam.
@_date: 2019-08-29 19:01:59
Me falaram aqui nessa thread. Acabei de pedir o cartão mas ainda tô confuso com o funcionamento. Ele tem uma parte de cryptocurrency mas que é bloqueada pra quem não chamou 3 amigos/paga mensalidade.

It's a greate place if you don't mind bad services. I mean, I really like it here, but every now and then I have a huge headache dealing with their lack of customer service. Today was with my bank, they blacklisted CB Pro because they deal with Bitcoin =)

It's in Aveiro, close to the canal. I was in the boat trip when I saw it.
Here's the plus code for Google maps --&gt;J8VR+7W Aveiro
@_date: 2019-12-27 16:06:52
Nope, just passed there, and it's in the maps
@_date: 2019-12-27 16:21:07
Hahaha demorou pra aparecer esse comentário.
@_date: 2019-12-27 13:03:37
I hope so. It's still closed so I can't check yet.
@_date: 2019-12-27 16:08:14
IIRC, since there's no laws regarding crypto, they can't charge anything for it. But most of the banks consider it an illegal activity and don't allow us to buy it directly.
@_date: 2019-12-27 12:44:28
A bar! It's in the name.
@_date: 2019-12-27 20:46:49
Do you know bolognese is an Italian dish right? Not portuguese.
@_date: 2019-12-27 13:55:41
Lol, I haven't noticed that before.
@_date: 2019-09-19 14:41:31
I've heard Bitcoin would hit big, didn't expect that big.
@_date: 2019-09-25 22:48:32
ELI5 what's Bakkt please.
@_date: 2019-09-25 23:05:34
Hmmm, that explains literally nothing, but thanks for the effort hahahaha
@_date: 2019-09-26 08:05:50
Oh, that's really interesting indeed. Thanks for the answer =)
