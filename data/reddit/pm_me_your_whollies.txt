Hold up, how did you spend 8k on a computer?
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:01:50
I am so glad for you. If it were up to me, I’d stick a small amount back in, and leave it for awhile, just so you don’t miss out if something good comes of if. But I don’t want to sound like a broken record, so Enjoy!

I’m still ecstatic that my brother brought home some Chinese yuan (probably spelled wrong, I know.) it’s not worth much, but it’s cool to see.
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:01:23
Thank you, Jesus Christ I couldn’t find that anywhere. So, if I want to sell without paying a transaction fee, I sell with a limit just slightly above market price?
@_date: 2017-12-11 12:32:06
Well, at least you have the gratification of helping a noob out.

@_date: 2017-12-08 17:26:22
Hey, I like that idea!

Apparently you haven’t read the story about the guy who shot his dick off and ate it.

Good luck to you. It might be worth it to take it to a professional, a lot of people aren’t smart enough to wipe their drive well enough. Hopefully that friend is one of them. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 00:52:06
Fair point, fair point.
@_date: 2017-11-27 16:09:41
Please do! If I did my math right, he’s looking at ~1.5 million before taxes, right?
@_date: 2017-11-08 02:53:17
Thanks! I’ve been half ass lurking for months, but finally fessed up and went in!
@_date: 2017-11-08 03:33:15
Ah, ok
@_date: 2017-11-27 22:35:47
*Exactly* End users are dumb, and I’m hoping that this friend wasn’t anything more than an end user.
@_date: 2017-11-08 10:25:31
I will if I feel comfortable with it.
@_date: 2017-11-08 02:41:00
Me thing I’m wondering. If Bitcoin really does keep going up steady, think we’ll ever see a split like a stock market? “Here, take ten times as many coin, we’re cutting the value to 1/10th of what it was?” I think at some point it’ll be unreasonable to have .0000001 btc represent hundreds.
@_date: 2017-11-08 02:38:01
There’s a thousand more I was planning on putting in a mutual fund. If Bitcoin keeps rocking on, I’ll put that in too.
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:35:51
Wow, ok then.
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:08:21
What app is this?
@_date: 2017-11-08 14:28:26
Haha, sure let’s go with that. Now how do I get those addresses? Lmao.
@_date: 2017-11-08 10:34:57
Huh. I’ll take that under advisement.
@_date: 2017-11-08 10:29:23
I’ll buy it at a low point, I just need to see how the market goes for now.
@_date: 2017-11-08 14:24:16
Ok, I will. Gotta wait for the transaction to go through first.
@_date: 2017-11-08 14:24:52
Thanks! I’ll consider it!
@_date: 2017-11-08 10:31:49
Nice! I plan on doing the same, just take a small percent into coin, maybe ethereum too.
@_date: 2017-11-27 15:42:44
I hope that you’re telling the truth, man. That just made my day.
@_date: 2017-11-08 03:33:49
Nah, the only time I think I’d “sell” is if I want to feel like a badass and buy something with it.
@_date: 2017-11-08 14:23:34
That kinda makes sense. Only put enough so that you’ll make money if the bottom falls out.
@_date: 2017-11-08 02:38:43
@_date: 2017-11-08 10:30:39
Then I’ll be cackling like a fool as I shift a small percentage of my earnings into Bitcoin every two weeks.

Year 2020: “PM, where’d all this money come from?”
@_date: 2017-11-27 15:21:46
Wake up bitch, it’s time to go shopping!
@_date: 2017-11-08 14:25:24
Hold on, I was checking the price, what were you... oh.
@_date: 2018-02-13 18:51:15
No, I respectfully disagree. A person’s ideal world can change, all it takes is sufficient motivation. Giving up like that is giving up on communicating with your fellow man.
@_date: 2018-02-15 04:06:14
Hey, we can disagree without devolving to a shit slinging fest. :D
@_date: 2018-02-13 18:52:10
Thanks. I think I have a gift for him too. I might just find a way to give him $20 or so of Bitcoin. Let him decide if he wants to keep it or spend it.
@_date: 2018-02-13 18:53:13
Thanks. Really informative!
@_date: 2018-02-12 17:58:39
*sigh* Thanks, sausage fingers again.
@_date: 2018-02-12 15:17:19
Let me know if you decide to allow the public to use this, whether that be through a website, app, MMS service, etc. I know it will take a lot of work on your end to put that together, but I for one would be very interested in having your tool at my disposal. I’m pretty new here, and could use all the help I can get.
@_date: 2018-03-12 13:55:54
Suburban or rural areas. 
@_date: 2018-02-13 18:52:27
@_date: 2018-02-13 18:49:51
I think I will do that in the future.
@_date: 2018-03-12 13:50:18
That is so cool! So, for a noob, is it something to do with the data of the picture file, or something imprinted into the picture’s pixels itself? If I were to print out that picture, is there some way to pull that transaction off of the picture on paper, or only when it’s electronic?
