So strong I’d hold at $0

Isn’t that called a job?

What a fucking vague &amp; ambiguous estimate, why did he waste oxygen to tell us this?

We all sell when we have holdings exceeding 1,000,000 of our home currency.

This morning a large number of users are reporting issues with their accounts on Binance.
Many people have logged in to find that all their altcoins were sold for BTC, and that many users also placed buy-orders for a specific coin at a price multiple times above its regular value.
This is only effecting users who have issued API keys on their accounts.
Current Updates:
Binance has confirmed that the issue seems to stem from the API via third-party tools.
If you use third-party trade bots, automation tools, portfolio trackers, or portfolio management tools that use Binance API keys you should consider:
Disabling those accounts either on Binance or the tool itself.
Disabling "trade" access to the API on Binance, or resetting the key.
Disabling your API keys on any other exchange that is hooked into the same systems.
Ensuring your 2FA is enabled, and you are using a strong and unique password.
At this time it does not seem like Binance was directly compromised in any way, but we are still awaiting official comments.
We will try to keep you updated as new information develops.
Edit - Update 1:
Binance is aware of the issue and investigating.
They have disabled withdrawals during this investigation to ensure that any compromised funds remain in their control.
They have confirmed this has only effected users with API keys (

She’s also his wife so she’s always right anyway.

Fantastic response!

This. We were teased with the bull-run of December, it was a glimpse at what could be. Anything above $5k is pretty much astounding, yet alone $10k.

Duly noted, tho I'm very set on working in the financial sector. I'll take your advice on board and see what happens if I succeed. Though for sure, my career would come first in every regard.
I do wonder though if having a small (I'm a poor student) portfolio developed across a variety of stocks and currencies is indicative of a passion over someone who has absolutely no evidence of wanting to work in finance? Feel so excited to talk about anything price analysis, gold, silver, Apple, bitcoin etc. Any idea?

Wish you could’ve included the Leonidas solo fight as a lone bull whale against the masses.

fuck since china has banned them does that mean I have to sell because I can't think for myself and am a weak individual who believes in the overnight millionaire philosophy?
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:34:46
It's much better than buying at $19k that's for sure!

TIL Blockfolio doesn't count as a girlfriend.

Thanks for this repost, I had already forgotten this meme from a week ago and a week before that.
@_date: 2017-09-15 11:50:57
I'm hoping in the coming future what with China maybe out of the way we will see a "power to the people" type movement and any bad news will be met with a strong enough resistance that has little impact or even inflates the price. But it is just a dream for now.
@_date: 2017-09-13 15:55:04
Yeah for sure, I'm by no means a "uninformed kid" when it comes to markets and TA. But will do some research into it.

Thanks a lot! What sort of wealth management experience could I gain as a pre-intern? I'm trying to do my upmost to stress my interest in the field and I hope that comes across as something I can talk about at interviews.
@_date: 2017-09-17 17:27:03
Thank you stranger from the internet with unsubstantiated evidence and advice, I believe you implicitly and will now sell all my left shoes because there's definitely no way this is a rumour and long term irrelevant.
@_date: 2017-09-13 09:33:37
On a genuine note, I was thinking of applying to JPM for a related internship, should I now not mention I'm passionate about cryptos? ��

Ever again if we're lucky ;)

RemindMe! 1 year
@_date: 2017-09-14 11:30:00
Yeah and we all should've bought 1000s of bitcoin when it was first conceived and sold at exactly $5000 years later...
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:35:04
Literally any decent exchange.
@_date: 2018-02-26 13:17:30
The demand has exceeded the supply.
@_date: 2018-02-26 13:19:29
I do believe that answers the question. ��
