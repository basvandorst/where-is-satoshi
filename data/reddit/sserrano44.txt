The Lightning Network is an idea of Joseph Poon and Tadge Dryja I saw them crafting it. Let’s not make Bitcoin a religion. We have already took Satoshi’s baton and is up to the entire community how to keep running this marathon

I'm longer term believer on the technology, so I only buy when the price goes down.
The community members that believe on the long-term Bitcoin positive effect on humanity could dedicate a small part of their capital to help reduce the current volatility, buying when is going down and selling when it heat ups too much.

Hi gburgwardt, 
  We try to respond to every support email we get. I will send you a PM.

As mentions we provide this service and it requires managing the risk. We are currently only taking hotels/tourism related merchants for the usd-&gt;btc flow but we are working to start accepting more industries.
We have many merchants in Argentina enjoying the benefits of Bitcoin and we are likely one of the biggest inflow of bitcoin to the country.

At BitPagos we are providing the service you are looking, but for the hotel industry. 
For your case credit card processing will be too much expensive, but we are working on a solution that could work for your case.

At BitPagos we are helping merchants that work with foreign costumers specially hotels charge their clients in USD and payout our merchants in BTC.

Thanks for your work valerian!

You got it right :) Merchants in Argentina with international clients love us.
@_date: 2014-04-15 04:14:58
Is good news
@_date: 2014-05-14 02:49:52
At BitPagos we specialize in processing payments in dollars and do payouts in bitcoins, most of our merchants are located in high-inflation countries or with expensive local processing options, as you may imagine our strongest country is Argentina.

Responding on behalf of BitPagos. This is the main service we offer, we are currently focus in Argentina and Venezuela, as you imagine the two countries that need the most an alternative currency. 
At the moment the only country we are restricting is the US. But onboarding merchants outside of LatAm may get difficult to complete the KYC.

there is a ECDSA implementation in python 
@_date: 2013-09-23 12:59:35
Not yet, but we expect changes soon, Argentina is always changing.
