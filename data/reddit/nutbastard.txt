I just don't see it going anywhere for the next month, but if I can't afford to buy back in a month or two from now anyway I'll probably be dead in a ditch so win/win : D
In the meantime, my LL only takes fiat so...

Broke, unemployed, solid return on $93-&gt;$621 over 6 months. Need to cover rent.
Would HODL if I could, but can't.
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:18:00
Not bad.

It WAS convenient, but it cant handle the traffic right now and BCH sales are "temporarily suspended"
I want OUT of BCH and I can't.
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:55:01
If you just want to have some skin in the game then $100 will suffice. But keep in mind that BTC will have to hit $30k before that $100 becomes $200, and there will be fees both coming and going.

Don't fret about a one day dip. The market just got shook the fuck up with the big X's taking on BCH and it'll correct in a few days or weeks.
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:58:58
What was the fee on that?
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:00:43
At least you got some drugs out of it?

June here, not sweating a single drop
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:54:20
No. As long as you had it before the fork its yours.
@_date: 2018-02-13 00:19:20

Lovers wanna love

You missed the joke

Wouldn't have posted it if BTC wasn't doing so well today *and* it happened to blow off my wall in a sudden gust of wind with the window open.
This is just an old example of how *not* to make an alternative currency. IIRC the guy in charge ended up in Federal prison.

Just keep cycling through tor nodes...
@_date: 2013-11-20 11:39:33
You're not wrong, Walter...

No. Transactions 	0 	
Total Received 	0 BTC 	
Final Balance 	0 BTC
Pretty accurate estimate there dude.

The most amazing part of this is that you bought in 2010, haven't been keeping up with it... but still managed to save your wallet.
Good on ya.
@_date: 2013-11-18 19:15:28


People said that when it hit $40, $80, $200....
@_date: 2013-11-19 02:15:50
But mine didn't quite turn out all sunshine and roses.
@_date: 2013-11-18 21:16:54
Don't think of it as buying 0.55BTC @ $550.
Think of it as buying 550,000μBTC @ $0.10
@_date: 2013-11-18 21:12:30
Ouch : (
@_date: 2013-11-18 20:41:52
Cruel and nice at the same time.
@_date: 2013-11-18 23:19:22
Just uh, just send them to me and I'll take care of all the hassle and paperwork.
Yeah, that's the ticket!
@_date: 2013-11-18 21:23:42


nigga you need to diversify your image hosting websites.

Literally thought of all this right after posting....

I'm trying to help you out bro.
