The price takes a plunge almost every Dec/Jan. That’s just how the market works.

You probably won’t see anything until later in the year after it happens. The halvening isn’t instantaneous. It’s a slow process.

I have read this before. The account has only one post to it. I’m not buying this story.

Oh that part for sure. But I was referring to the price of Bitcoin going up. Many people think it’s going to skyrocket overnight. But the reality is that it will probably take some time to get a momentum going.

Honest question...How would you know if the crypto donations are being donated from inside the country?

Cool. It kind of sounds complicated. Hopefully it’s a lot easier of a process than how I am envisioning it. Thanks for the info! ✨��✨

Never said it was perfect. Maybe affiliate links are the problem? I follow several crypto sites with no affiliate links and they have no removals or issues.

I doubt their claim would hold up in court if it was challenged. There are existing examples of the Bitcoin name being rejected by other trademark offices for it being a generic term for currency.

Who knows? Maybe? Never read them. But legit TA sites I follow haven’t been affected by this. So that’s saying something.

Clearly the people who write the guidelines. That’s who. Don’t like it? Go post on another platform. Pretty simple.

No censorship going on. They are just removing shitty videos from people trying to spread FUD or make a quick buck from their scammy affiliate links. I follow plenty of legit crypto feeds on YouTube that haven’t been effected by any of this.

This is the most sensible things I’ve read on the Internet today. ��

What about all the whales that manipulate the price of the market?

One article comes out and people start acting like quantum computing is going to be available at Best Buy next year. ��‍♂️
