What you don't seem to understand is that bitcoin actually *does* solve that problem. You and the firearms seller *don't have to* use coinbase. If something is stopping you from doing business, just use the raw bitcoin protocol, which doesn't discriminate.
This is the fundamental difference between bitcoin and the current banking system. Bitcoin is true financial freedom
@_date: 2015-06-20 01:26:12
It's actually not that hard to implement your own payment system on top of the bitcoin protocol. Sure there's a cost to developing and maintaining that, but if that gives you financial freedom, that's what you're going to do.
@_date: 2015-12-05 19:22:05

Bitcoin is financial freedom of choice. 
If Coinbase doesn't want to do business with someone, that's their fair choice to do so. With bitcoin, you have that freedom too. Don't like coinbase? Go with another service. Don't like other services? Go with the raw bitcoin protocol which doesn't discriminate.

Could this be an effective attack on smaller alt coins? What if one miner decides to put a lot of hashing power on an alt coin, until it changes difficulty and then switches that power off. Wouldn't that make the currency effectively unusable (for a while, until the difficulty re adjusts)?

What ApplePay will do is make people more familiar with the 'virtualization' of money. 
Credit cards was a first step to move away from cash. ApplePay is a step to move away from cards. And then comes bitcoin, a move away from state-supplied cash and banks.
It doesn't seem that far-fetched to say that eventually banks will not even issue cards and just provide you with 'keys' to the bank account.
The jump from cards to bitcoin is quite big for most people. But the jump from ApplePay to bitcoin not that much.

I agree with you on the long term. But you can't change the world in one step. You're going to need to take baby steps and then build apon that slow and steady. People need to be educated on security, which is happening already due to all these data breaches we're seeing lately. Once people know enough about security, then they might start feeling a bit less nervous about being their own bank.
The key thing with bitcoin is **choice**. Even if there are bitcoin banks and bitcoin payment processors like we know them now, I'm not forced to use them.

Mining is always going to trend towards being a zero sum game. It's only profitable if (1) the price is going up so they are betting on future value and (2) if the miner can maintain an advantage on the other miners (by being able to make superior mining hardware).
My point is: you give miners what they want, their profits increase, hash rate goes up because they can afford it, and then a few difficulty adjustments later we're back to square one where it's not profitable anymore.
@_date: 2017-03-16 12:21:15

Say you earn the US average of 55,000$. You want to buy a house, so you save 15% of your income after tax each month (that's optimistic for most people), you would save around $6,847.5 each year. Assuming you are lucky the economy does well and you keep your steady job for a long time, it would take you ~45 years to save up $300,000. You are also paying rent every month, while you are saving up for your dreamhouse. This rent money could go to paying off your mortgage, but instead you're paying into someone else's pocket. By the time you have enough saved, house prices have increased significantly because of inflation (and potentially other market conditions).
Now do the math for the case where you would be paying off a 30-year mortgage and you will see that you are way better off.
A broader example: companies need creditlines in form of investment to be able to grow. Tesla can't build a megafactory to build it's cars if it had to save up for 50 years first.
The issue here is that most people don't research well enough before making financial decisions. It's unfortunate that there are people and institutions that will scam you for your money, but honestly... that's kind of a given these days. When you get a good deal, you can be 100% sure that there's a money making tactic behind it.

It's a different power dynamic. When women spew hate at men, its can safely be ignored. When men spew hate at women, they are made to fear for their lives. That's the reality of our current situation.
@_date: 2017-07-19 21:18:46
No hate, but definitely disrespectful. Even if these comments are meant to be funny, to women who have to deal with this crap every day it's not "funny", it's a reminder that they are the minority and have to work way harder to get the kind of recognition that men get by default. When they then say they don't like it, they are branded as feminazis.

Well, if some guy called it a PRINCIPLE, then it MUST BE TRUE. /s
At the very least, if this can be proven, then you're admitting that you are just a being with no agency since your actions are governed by evolutionary behavior. We, as humans with incredible brains, can find ways to overcome evolutionary behavior. To assume our behavioral instincts equate to something "truthful", "moral", or "just" is where your fallacy lies.

Great video. I usually take these sort of videos with a pinch of salt, but really it does make a lot of sense.
Sounds to me like bitcoin is a realistic solution to solve this problem, but it's going to take a lot of effort and time to get there. It's not in the US governments interest to support bitcoin. If they decide to ban dealing with bitcoin, I'm tempted to think that it enforces the claims in the video.
@_date: 2013-10-19 19:19:45
it follows the same trends, yes, but it's definitely not the forefront market anymore. The only reason people still trade on it is because they can't get fiat out and some traders like the volatility (like me).
The price of btc on mtgox = average market price + 5% (withdrawal fee) + cost of wire transfer + withdrawal amount cap + desperation to get out of gox + additional volatility because of all of this.

yeah I've seen those a lot
@_date: 2013-11-11 19:13:58
it's right there, on the main page
@_date: 2013-09-13 15:59:15
ok, thanks for the info

If you're having trouble with the video:

Oddly, that order just disappeared.

I love this new paper shredder :)

To start, here's a great video about how the protocol works:

I sent them a mail a few months ago asking to accept bitcoin, the response was something along the lines of "no". Reason being that they don't handle payments internally, a 3rd party company does it for them or something.

No, and there's nothing wrong with asking questions right? :)

Interesting. But to make that order, the person needs to have $2m sitting in MtGox right?
@_date: 2013-11-30 16:25:09
relevant part starts at 3:33

Great video!
@_date: 2013-10-18 21:39:57
a brick!
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:14:55
Yes, estimated time until your order is processed.
@_date: 2013-05-05 11:24:20
I don't think so. The order was 18k and the volume over the last 25mins only goes up to 3k.

A lot of people are still early to the party, are you going to say that to every new person?
@_date: 2013-11-10 14:53:40
That Bitcoin piece is nice! I bet you'll sell that in no time.

That would be GMT-5, so New York-ish?
