off the top of my head it could be paralysis of choice, a common UX pitfall.
An option to avoid this in this case might be to give the BTC donation button less visual weight than the existing IRL currency options

Narcotics be damned, I have a prescription for advair, in canada its 175 for about a 2 months supply, in india its around 30, and im legally allowed to import prescription drugs if I have a prescription. Silk road let me circumvent the drug company racket for a drug I need to live.

yeah, actually fun fact, it would be cheaper for me to take a taxi to and from the hospital and say Im having an asthma attack then it would be to buy my ventilin from the pharmacy, because they give me free ventelin when I'm admitted and I get to take it home when I leave.
I only found this out because one time I was having a mild attack, one where I didn't need an ambulance, but it was severe enough that I felt more comfortable if I could be with professional care, so I took a cab to the hospital.
Even though we have 'free health care' we're still victims of the drug companies. I'd much prefer England's or France's system where the drugs are covered as well (or at the very least the essential drugs that patients are proven to need to continue living). And no health insurance will take me either except Trillium (the Ontario govt option) because asthma is a 'pre-existing condition'
