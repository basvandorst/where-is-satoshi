I was there, when it started, but I won't be part of the end. Having the finger on the mouse button...

Didn't say anything about selling. Just put some fiat in place to catch that dip at 10K.
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:20:47
you'll be able to buy  soon. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:40:18
Its gonna be worse. Down it goes.
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:31:46
Calm down, very soon noone is willing to sell anymore - wait - cant sell anymore because the fees exceed their portfolios. So the price will not fall any further..

Who is always unpinning this thread?
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:10:24
Hold tight! This will be a down to 10K dip...

Blockfolio does that for you. Just configure your actual coin portfolio and always be up 2 date about the value.
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:17:43
It starts again. Heavy...

For me it seems someone wants the price to be stuck at 17250. With success. Actually does not look like we will pass this line somehow. Just far too low buying power.
@_date: 2017-12-14 08:05:20
The 17250 wall is back again and even higher. That confuses me a little...

RIP mempool. Thats just incredible whats going on right now...
@_date: 2017-12-14 08:19:04
Thats what i thought. Someone wants to artificially keep bitcoin under 18K. But you need to have some big wallets to do this long term.

Actually no invitation codes can be generated.
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:15:16
Bitcoins shutting down.
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:31:11
BCH deep dive as soon as selling is enabled. Just my 2 cents...
@_date: 2017-12-21 13:38:26
Source? What news?
@_date: 2017-12-14 09:31:00
seems like today we don't even reach the wall.
@_date: 2017-12-13 15:02:31
which is not too bad at all.
