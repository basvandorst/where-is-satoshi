I'm kinda being sarcastic but...
Come on guys, we've read lots of stories about people who got into bitcoin early and then forget about it for a long period of time.
So could this guy have invented and published bitcoin and then walk away from it?  Bitcoin's barely starting to go mainstream so if he was out of the scene it could dodge his attention for this long.
Knock on the door... oh, bitcoin? Yeah, I'm not involved with that any more. (I wonder how they found out about bitcoin).
The shitty part would be trying to dig up your old keys!

If you value your relationship, tell your wife!
You might have to sugar coat it a bit, you don't want her pissed at you for keeping it secret for so long.
It has grown so fast it's not like it's been worth 1.8M for long.
Tell her.  Make a plan.  Like take some out to improve your life and hold most of it as long as you can.
Want to start your own business? Use some for seed money. Don't blow it all or even most of it.
But seriously, you should probably tell your wife unless maybe your relationship is fucked already. If you keep it a secret, it could be.  Money's not everything.  Do you think people think about how much money they had when they're on their death bed?  Nope. Family and relationships.

I "bought" some bitcoin last night, only 0.04 worth, and it still hasn't shown up at my address.  Probably technical difficulties due to the demand and I've sent them an email about it this morning.  Anyone else experience this?
