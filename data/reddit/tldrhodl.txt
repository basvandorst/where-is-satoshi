Miner's node software doesn't really matter, there's just too few of them. Miners provide hashrate, that's their job.

Exactly! Exchanges and companies that signed NYA are risking millions and millions if they actually go through with it - it seems really obvious now - so **why** are they not backing out of NYA faster and in greater numbers? Only just very few did backtrack on this. That's why I'm worried - why are NYA signatories still on board with Ver??
I see only two options - a) they are all so crazy/deluded/stupid/misinformed or whatever. In that case all is well. But there is b) they know something we don't.
And what I described above is just the only ace I can imagine for them to have "in their sleeve", waiting to be played.
And yes, I very much hope a) is the right answer.

That is not a problem. Miners pay (huge) bills, regularly and in fiat. They mine whatever is most profitable. Period. Only short term (right after the fork) the will **probably** stick to NYA and mine Segwit2x. But if we win, they'll mine "our" Bitcoin again - our coin just needs to have a bigger market value than their coin, that's all. Everything else is just r/btc propaganda...
@_date: 2017-10-16 10:47:39
