You talking about Bitcoin Classic?
@_date: 2017-08-25 03:28:57
This is not Bitcoin. Please post to r/btc or r/SegWit

I use it in the real world. It's faster and cheaper than Bitcoin Classic (BTC).
@_date: 2017-08-25 03:36:54
r/SegWit 
@_date: 2017-08-18 23:28:43
Haha yea, I'm not a fan of the trigraphs. I believe the true peer to peer electronic cash Bitcoin is what some misguided people are referring to as Bitcoin Cash.

This should be posted to r/segwit.

Please stop writing "bcash". Doing this causes problems for people new to Bitcoin. You could just refer to it as Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash or BCH. The legacy Bitcoin should be referred to as Classic, SegWit, or BTC. Ethereum went through this last year and it worked itself out just fine.

Are you talking about Bitcoin (BCH) or Bitcoin Classic aka SegWit coin (BTC)?
@_date: 2017-08-26 18:37:57
Honestly they both forked.

Seems like a bunch of people are confused about which sub is which.
@_date: 2017-08-23 00:11:46
This sub seems to be a better place to discuss BCH than r/btc. Are people just confused?

Shouldn't this posted on r/btc ? Don't let them hijack your brand.
