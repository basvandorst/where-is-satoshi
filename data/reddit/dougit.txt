I have used Chase for over 1 year to fund purchase of bitcoin. Coinbase sent me an email specifically saying my bank denied purchase—directly with checking account, NOT a credit/debit card. Chase says transaction never was initiated by Coinbase. Just bought more, we will see if Coinbase lies and says bank denied...hopefully it was a “glitch.”

I am starting to think it is Coinbase and not Chase that is the guilty party. I just called my bank, and it appears Coinbase is at fault. However, since bitcoin dropped in price even more since that denied purchase, I will get even more Bitcoin for my $ right now, that is, if Coinbase does not cancel the transaction again. F() ck Coinbase.

The company's actions/inabilities almost seem like a scam. Might Coinbase actually be working for the central banks?

And Coinbase is broken AGAIN.
