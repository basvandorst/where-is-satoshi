Unless your smartphone has another clandestine application that is somehow taking screenshots of your Signal chats.
Yes, Signal blocks screenshots inside it's app. But what if there is a keylogger on your phone that captures everything you input into your smartphone?

So the possible $100,000's of dollars on your Trezor then no longer matters?
Are you serious?
BurtW lost around $200k in coins...ask HIM if "worrying about other things" is a valid argument here. (He lost the money even though the charges were dismissed)
Yes, you could have bigger concerns at that point. But that does not answer the underlying question of how to best secure your bitcoins.

I did not know Trezor had multi-sig!
Thank you for this information.

You may not have enough coins to ever worry about things like this...but guess what? Some of us do..

You are obviously an idiot.
I am talking SPECIFICALLY ABOUT THE TREZOR.
Not sure why I'm even replying to you. You have zero insight into anything worth talking about.

The US Government/most Western governments aren't going to pummel someone with a wrench to get someone's private keys.
That is, unless they are a "terrorism" suspect.
In the instance of BurtW, this just isn't going to happen. Are they going to deny him bail and keep him locked in a concrete box so he can't move his coins? Absolutely. 
Are they going to smash his face in with a wrench? No, they aren't.
Can we please have an intelligent discussion about this vulnerability from a technical standpoint? Not a juvenile, "I am just going to say quick one liners here to prove my non-existent point".
Anyone here with actual TECHNICAL knowledge have any insight about this vulnerability?

Difficult, but possible.

You're right, the Trezor is not your seed...but my understanding is the Trezor contains the "master" private key from which all the other private keys are derived in your HD wallet.
If the attacker can extract this "master" private key somehow from the physical device...your coins are as good as gone.
You could memorize your 24 word seed for transport.
Even if you were monitored closely, there are ways to keep your seed a secret if you only utilize it on rare occasion to spend, then immediately wipe any trace.

..and if you're unable to because you're being held captive by a government agency?
BurtW from BitcoinTalk comes to mind. I believe he said he was using Trezor?
