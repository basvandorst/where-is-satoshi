Throw away because I actually -know- the assholes. They absolutely did get away with it. [Nathan Wosnak]( is still out there having a super corporate day, making more money from the community, not even remotely afraid to use his real name anymore. Dalin Owen is a far more private individual but would open up easy with a couple beers in the right company, he absolutely owned mybitcoin.com, absolutely was involved in daily operations and greasy enough to try to walk away with everyones funds on a whim. He's a lot harder to build a dossier on, beyond anecdotes anyways. Nathan has too much ego to stay out of the light, but there is no doubt in my mind that him and Dalin split funds between them. I used to call these mooks friends, they implicated other friends of ours for being involved in the hack and tried to shift all the blame they could to anyone the slightest bit could stick too. The claims that Talksugar, Link2Voip, MyBitcoin, Hackcanada and Nettwerked.net were all registered by the same registrars but somehow have no connection to one another is easily debunked by just by googling Nathan, the guy used his real name across every platform and still hangs on to his The Clone alias pretty openly. I'm still bitter...
