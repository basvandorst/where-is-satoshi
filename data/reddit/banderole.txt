Thanks for spreading this info! Phishing sites like this might seem obvious, but only when you're on the lookout for them

Really, wow. That actually surprises me. Do you mind me asking what the refund was for? I mean, did you not receive your order, or did you receive it late?

The way people are treating OP is just disgusting. Really makes me ashamed of some of the BTC community. Even if he was lying, taking it to the point that they did was childish. And if he was telling the truth, I feel for the guy. Sucks to be called a liar, even by internet strangers.

I do not support Trump, and I'm hoping for a Clinton victory. But I suppose a little BTC could be a silver lining if things don't go that way. 
Regardless, every American should get out and vote, please! Drag your friends out too, this is important.

This was a response to my question: "...is there an estimated time I could expect delivery? Will that estimation change depending on which machine I bought?"

To answer some questions: I made the paper wallet myself, and just transferred over the same amount as his first purchase. So the wallet is secure, and really has his BTC in it.
His BTC sales are from his mousetrap (that I posted here a little while ago). He's only sold a couple for BTC, but he loves it, and he doesn't want to cash it out!

Are you concerned about paypal cutting you off? I've read that they don't like e-cigs (along with all their other BS).

Awesome, thanks! Say hi to Cheddar for me!
@_date: 2013-11-08 21:08:45
haha, I was really hoping someone would do that. TECHNOLOGY!

No YT is being a little weird about it, and it's upsetting because it's terrible timing for it to act up. Try watching it at 360 resolution.
@_date: 2013-11-08 21:08:22
Yeah, thanks for the warning. I actually made the paper wallet myself, just using the same amount as the purchase. So it is secure until he wants to crack it open and retrieve the private key!

[u/_ali_ has a good post below here.]( That's a good place to start reading to learn more about mining. Buying an ASIC is just the start of it, and I agree, the drama is quite fun!

If your bitcoin does make you rich, it will be because people like OP bought stupid puzzles right now. How about a little gratitude.

I'm in a similar boat. I preordered 2 of the 4.5gh jalepenos *the day before yesterday...*
I feel good about it, but I regret not getting the 30gh now, haha.

I made the background myself, but you can get secure paper wallets from 
it kind of annoys me that every time you click that link it generates an address. I know there are an almost limitless number of potential wallets, but it feels like a waste still!

He loves asking what it's worth now. (At this point it's $53.46, well over double.)
edit: might be worth mentioning what he's selling! I've posted this here before, but in case anyone missed it, it's the mousetrap he invented [The Teeterpong!](

I just want to share an email exchange I had with BFL in April. This is why I bought a miner:












So not only was that date way off, but it also isn't true that they shipped the same time regardless of product. I agree that it was clear there would be a wait, but this is pushing it.
