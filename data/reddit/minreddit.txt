@_date: 2018-09-28 01:55:28
It is a surge for the HODLtards
@_date: 2018-09-10 07:03:47
Most people in this sub tried to do that
@_date: 2018-09-07 09:05:48
So how many old wallets exist that can move tens of thousands of BTC to the exchanges and dump on the market?
@_date: 2018-09-09 00:49:42
Lol, this market BTW... jajaja
@_date: 2018-09-29 06:20:52

Good morning everyone. Today btc will ...
@_date: 2018-08-05 02:38:25
When people saying the market does not react to news. How come the market crashes like a hard rock whenever there are some tiny bad news, e.g., exchanges that never heard of before were hacked.
Conclusion: people are just delusional and try to not accept the truth. The truth of Bitcoin might go all the way down.
@_date: 2018-08-07 23:50:39
People saying market does not react the news BTW...lol
@_date: 2018-08-10 07:33:11

@_date: 2018-08-24 03:15:03
Who were giving people false hope that ETF might go through? RETARDS?
@_date: 2018-08-18 15:01:59
Haha, every month we will have lower new highs. So btm might be much lower.
@_date: 2018-08-17 02:44:12

@_date: 2018-08-17 04:10:11
Today is Chinese valentines day! Bullish or Bearish?
@_date: 2018-08-04 13:12:31
I think yesterday's news is not good news?
@_date: 2018-08-16 00:03:42
Lol, he is a retard.
@_date: 2018-08-09 10:48:43
Good morning! I guess Bitcoin will rise a bit or fall hard
@_date: 2018-05-23 03:16:39
Finally saw this meme!!!!
@_date: 2018-08-23 03:43:55
People still hope Bitcoin ETF go through? You'd better buy some lottery, and hope you win it, LMAO.

So is it time to say: "real world adoption, moon tomorrow"?
@_date: 2018-10-12 10:26:10
Well, if they have millions of bitcoins, the early miners, yes, they need much more HODLers in order to dump their shit.
@_date: 2018-10-12 08:37:09
@_date: 2018-10-26 12:21:58
@_date: 2018-10-26 12:20:57

So u wish a stable coin moon?
@_date: 2018-10-12 08:36:23
That's the so called HODL memes, they hope more people will HODL, while they can slowly take profits. Those people are retards.
@_date: 2018-10-25 04:33:34
Is this good or bad, btw?
@_date: 2018-10-27 12:59:14

I am not asking for anything... I am telling something that are likely to be true. Why rekt?
@_date: 2018-10-18 12:27:20
All of these are bullshit!!! The sad thing is that all of the posts in this sub are like this...
@_date: 2018-10-03 12:51:22
@_date: 2018-10-13 13:54:52
Nice bot. User name checks out. 
@_date: 2018-10-19 04:43:28

@_date: 2018-10-19 06:30:29
Hmm, HODLtards like u...
@_date: 2018-10-01 15:01:41
The outcome may not be what you expected. Just like people before expected consensus conference, bitcoin etf...the so called false hope.
@_date: 2018-10-21 03:50:17
Hodltards will ask u to come back after 10 years.
@_date: 2018-10-25 04:47:43
You are like those market prediction experts that can not be wrong, right?
@_date: 2018-06-04 09:59:59
LOL, the market now either has no volume, or big dump.
@_date: 2018-06-27 00:39:36
Why not compare to the price in 2010? Still sad.
@_date: 2018-06-23 01:01:51
Why buy the dip when you can buy the floor?
@_date: 2018-06-29 10:24:01
The last point is not true. It won't hold 5.9k soon. LOL. Bitcoin is dead
@_date: 2018-06-22 09:41:51
U should fuck mt.gox trustee first. He still has millions of btc to dump.
@_date: 2018-06-28 01:38:58
Will be a dump, I think
@_date: 2018-06-10 02:00:10
So, Bitcoin is not dead?
@_date: 2018-06-30 08:05:29

@_date: 2018-06-11 02:38:29
So, bitcoin die first, or early adopters die first?
@_date: 2018-06-19 10:05:24
@_date: 2018-06-20 01:08:17
jajaja, no one is buying bitcoin nowadays.
@_date: 2018-06-27 00:48:22

Bill Gates will dump the market.

@_date: 2018-06-22 09:14:24
Shit show, indeed.

@_date: 2018-06-22 13:59:56
BTC is the true bitconnect?
@_date: 2018-06-13 12:27:18

Tmr will be another day
@_date: 2018-06-19 00:10:49
This artificial pump... back to 6.5k in 9hrs.
@_date: 2018-06-10 09:37:22
In reality, it is the dip after the dip after dip^dip.
@_date: 2018-06-29 01:40:32
Who the fuck said 6000 is a strong support? LOL
@_date: 2018-06-20 13:51:49
Sell now and buy back at the next 6.5 k
@_date: 2018-06-24 05:46:57
Celebrating the new high-5900!
@_date: 2018-06-05 01:47:46
Tired of this bear market! How it is gonna last, fuck
@_date: 2018-06-08 00:15:20
Fucking low trading volume.
@_date: 2018-06-27 12:12:11
@_date: 2018-06-29 10:21:10
buy bitcoin when it goes to $1. 
@_date: 2018-06-22 01:47:34
This market ...
@_date: 2018-06-19 02:50:09
Good move.
@_date: 2018-06-08 11:17:05
Marginal trading is just the stupidest thing one can do at this market. Exchange can easily manipulate the market with such low volume.
@_date: 2018-06-11 08:50:59
@_date: 2018-06-27 00:48:35
Not even a contest
@_date: 2018-06-22 09:00:04
So, is Bitcoin a fraud or a frog? The virus is spreading BTW, dumping virus BTW...
@_date: 2018-06-21 11:42:45
See ya 6.5k. My old friend!
@_date: 2018-06-22 09:33:26
Butt run and shit show. 
@_date: 2018-06-22 09:22:05
NVM, we will have lower highs. Weeks later people will pray for btc go back to 6k.
@_date: 2018-06-01 11:22:38
I bet that the 100 investors institutional locked in da room will dump the market 2 hours later.
@_date: 2018-06-29 06:41:33
So the new high is 5.8k now? Bullish(Bullshit)
@_date: 2018-06-08 05:32:11
So, still waiting for da institutional money?
@_date: 2018-06-17 02:50:03
That dip cause a little bit of spike in volume, and disappear after one day. No one is buying bitcoin nowadays. 
@_date: 2018-06-29 07:12:14
Even that happens, it will be a small and short pump, and then followed by a huugge dump.
@_date: 2018-06-20 03:52:16
Haha, people are still bullish!
@_date: 2018-06-05 09:06:33
But seems those newbees only spend their money on those worthless icos. Even during this bear market, people can easily raise tens of millions of USDs easily, while kept 96% of the tokens as the team fund. 
@_date: 2018-06-22 05:03:53
Told ya to buy back at 6.5 k.
@_date: 2018-06-30 05:00:15
It is a trap. Buhahaha. 
@_date: 2018-06-30 08:06:36
Retards keep celebrating lower new highs.
@_date: 2018-06-29 03:45:25
@_date: 2018-06-17 02:36:33
Nowadays, the only way to pump volume is to dump bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-06-08 10:58:44
This type of posts are kust bullshit. People in the meme are not the same one.
@_date: 2018-06-23 13:33:21
Should we celebrating the new high 6100?
@_date: 2018-06-30 10:28:43
Are u da smart boi?
@_date: 2018-06-16 13:59:46
When high volume?
@_date: 2017-11-10 02:00:46
How to upgrade to SegWit as a normal user on platform like bittrex?
@_date: 2017-11-16 11:26:39
So is there another fork coming? 
@_date: 2018-06-23 01:01:30

@_date: 2018-11-29 02:36:14
Stupid shit...
@_date: 2018-03-30 12:05:59
How can they regulate a coin that is already dead? FUCK !!!
@_date: 2019-01-10 12:11:30
Now, tell me what the fuck has happened, bitcoiners?
@_date: 2019-01-08 01:37:58
Why the bitcoiner lose his hand? 
@_date: 2019-01-24 04:29:45
Meme technology withdraw ETF application.
@_date: 2019-01-19 06:50:28
It is dead as fuck. But still a good way to steal money from the poor people, since no law has been established to protect them.
@_date: 2019-01-19 07:02:59
@_date: 2019-01-08 12:57:49
Whales pls pump the market, so we can dump our shit on you - bitcoiners
@_date: 2018-03-30 04:56:11

Jamie said BTC is a frog this time, and whoever kissed it will be sent to jail. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 08:12:23

@_date: 2017-09-15 08:12:23
Why cant they close in ont shot, instead of one by one.
@_date: 2017-09-22 11:57:36
What is wrong wth BTC boy today?
@_date: 2017-10-26 15:01:27
So, do I actually lose the same amount of BTC as well? If that is the case, who dare to make a transaction after the fork?
@_date: 2018-07-15 02:05:51
I am holding your mother.

@_date: 2018-07-02 00:31:07
Dump after fake pump, that's guaranteed. Isn't that enough?
@_date: 2019-09-27 12:06:05
it does not matter, weak resistance and weak support
@_date: 2018-07-27 07:52:44
Be careful, the moon boiz will chase behind you if btc ever climbs 1%.
@_date: 2018-07-10 10:07:11
Nope, 5k, as people already satisfied with 6k as the new high.
@_date: 2018-07-16 11:53:28

@_date: 2018-07-10 00:31:02

@_date: 2018-07-14 11:37:22
Is that all your imagination?
@_date: 2018-07-21 07:47:58
I sold way more than that. Why against people taking profit. If you choose to hold, keep hold.
@_date: 2018-07-01 15:39:44

@_date: 2017-10-26 14:12:57

@_date: 2018-07-16 11:53:57
This is called reverse crash...
@_date: 2018-07-19 01:05:22
It was a Butt trap not even bull trap.
@_date: 2018-07-03 10:15:24
Here comes the dump.
@_date: 2018-07-31 01:22:20

@_date: 2018-07-01 07:31:53
So, time to short?
@_date: 2018-07-25 15:35:06
Haha, they are the same ones who pumped it...
@_date: 2018-07-12 08:36:30
Healthy reverse growth.
@_date: 2018-07-03 12:31:52
Now I feel 5k is possible.
@_date: 2018-07-23 03:26:23
@_date: 2018-07-31 10:32:07
@_date: 2018-07-30 11:22:34
@_date: 2018-07-17 02:39:33
That until might last long though...
@_date: 2018-07-02 00:28:49
Dump followed by a fake pump with low volume, guaranteed.
@_date: 2018-07-10 10:04:59
And, this is the natural growth we were talking about?
@_date: 2018-07-03 02:26:51
And down 70% since Jan... 
@_date: 2018-07-01 00:45:55
This is fake pump. Gonna drop soon. 
@_date: 2018-07-12 14:15:52
Da 5 bitcoin bears
@_date: 2018-07-15 02:07:00
I trade, not holding.
@_date: 2018-07-15 02:07:45
Sentiment on the forums is important for trade though. 
@_date: 2018-07-06 08:40:30
Bart pattern!
@_date: 2018-07-14 11:36:54
Institutional investors...analyst... grab more...discount...
@_date: 2018-07-11 01:55:13
It stops bleeding now. Time to have bullish memes?
@_date: 2018-07-27 05:33:51
BTC ETF, postpone first, then reject?
@_date: 2018-07-01 15:15:27
Easy money, this market is too predictable!
@_date: 2018-04-01 10:20:25
Where are those bitcoin memes?
@_date: 2017-07-19 02:13:21
If 80% has not been reached, because more than 20% supports SegWit. Will BIP 91 still be activated?  
@_date: 2017-07-18 23:42:56
I saw a significant amount of miners support SegWit. Isn't BIP 91 also include SegWit? What are the differences between the two?
@_date: 2017-07-18 15:49:34
Some miners vote for Segwit, instead of BIP 91. 
What are the differences between these two? According to this article, BIP 91 also supports Segwit.
@_date: 2018-12-20 07:12:34
What a retarded article. Why not they buy on coinbase then?
@_date: 2018-12-02 07:57:18
Hello, poor HODLtards
@_date: 2017-07-19 01:57:11
Let's say if 75% supports BIP 91, 25% support SegWit. Which way will it go? Chain split? Since 80% has not been reached.
@_date: 2018-12-18 10:59:53
@_date: 2018-12-20 03:35:47
More like 2k, cause dump always come harder than pump!
@_date: 2018-12-20 07:11:27
Welcome to ghost town.
