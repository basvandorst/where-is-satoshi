People have been FOMOing into bitcoin since it jumped over 10k. Now the crash, cause it didn’t hit 20k in rapid time
@_date: 2019-07-01 21:48:35
Wow, look at those charts going ^UP
@_date: 2019-07-25 15:37:55
Talia is more of a “store of wealth” proponent
@_date: 2019-07-24 16:42:23
Ouch. Another HODL story for the record books.
@_date: 2019-07-14 16:22:55
So, to summarize, the media and government suck, let’s educate our friends and family about bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-11-06 03:54:53
 If you’re ok with parting with 5-10k (as in little to NO chance you’ll need the money in the next five years), then yes, absolutely. 
I think bitcoin as a good chance of being over 100k in five years time.
@_date: 2019-11-11 00:47:01
Id agree
@_date: 2019-11-08 18:06:17
You can “survive” 24 hours with only the clothes on your back.
How about a video where you can “thrive” with only BTC for 24 hours?
The title is misleading anyway, because the “newbie”  states that using BTC was “inconvenient”.
@_date: 2019-11-22 18:15:34
Yup. Hindsight 20/20.
Investing in BTC short term is enough of a gamble for me anyway, lol
@_date: 2019-11-19 18:26:14
Still confident?
@_date: 2019-11-13 05:23:39
Not gonna happen, should added another couple years
@_date: 2019-11-19 01:31:13
No clue. That’s about $500 though.  So either it’s a promo, someone sent it to the wrong address, you’re confused, or you’re a liar.
@_date: 2019-11-11 00:45:19
I think 300,000-400,000 by 2023 for a new all time high. 
Not sure about 500,000 though
@_date: 2019-11-19 18:33:40
No, I know. No bet was made. I’m just checking in at the 3 week mark to get your opinion. Don’t really get the opportunity to talk to many people about bitcoin - good or bad.
@_date: 2019-11-19 18:40:59
Yes, a lot longer.  I think once it drop somewhere below 8k, they’ll be a small surge to around 8500 and then another gradual decline to around 7200 or so.  Not sure what will happen beyond that, but the current trend leads me to believe itll drop to around 6400. Maybe sometime in January.
@_date: 2019-11-11 17:20:12
No, that’s much sooner
@_date: 2019-08-14 04:01:44
Did you ever backup the wallet.dat file?
@_date: 2019-08-29 22:54:33
Looks like it’ll go lower
@_date: 2019-10-26 19:17:47
So now when I’m robbed in the future, it’ll just take longer. Great
@_date: 2019-08-13 18:39:00
If you’re making 10-20x profit, it’s foolish not to sell *some* of your btc.
Of course, nothing will help you with your remorse of selling when btc hits 6 figures, other than the memory of your kid going to a good school.  So hold on to that sentiment, you’ll need it!
@_date: 2019-08-09 03:32:38
@_date: 2019-10-11 03:48:56
Depends on your definition of “real currency”
Right now, I can purchase *some* goods/services with bitcoin, the same as with any currency issued from the government.
That’s pretty real to me.
When you buy something with a debit card, you don’t have actual dollars, but just a balance in your bank account.
As far as an “actual bitcoin” (physical?), that doesn’t exist because bitcoin is a peer to peer cryptocurrency that is documented and tracked on an electronic ledger.
The US dollar used to be backed by gold. Now it’s just backed on a promise.  Any currency is *real* as long as people accept it in exchange for goods and services.
@_date: 2019-08-02 17:11:18
How many do you have
@_date: 2019-08-09 03:37:54
@_date: 2019-10-25 16:20:09
I heard it was *dead*
@_date: 2019-08-02 17:17:20
Ok.  If you had 4,000 Or something, I may have agreed, lol
@_date: 2019-10-26 05:31:07
I still think we’re dropping below $7000 in the weeks to come
@_date: 2019-08-14 03:53:13
You were accessing them on your computer, but where were they stored? What wallet?
@_date: 2019-10-26 05:34:45
How many weeks do I get?
I’m thinking I need 5-6 weeks until bitcoin is around $6900, but it could be a few more.
@_date: 2019-08-06 00:58:19
My hold theory is buy and hold.  Once/if your investment hits 10-20x the amount you put in, it would be foolish not to take *some* out.
Just don’t forget 2017.  Bitcoin went parabolic in December.  Everyday it was up another couple hundred on average.  And it had thousand dollar swings.  On its way down, alts picked up in January 2018 and went parabolic.
Once you see something similar again, think about selling.  It’s counter intuitive, but when you see it rising like crazy and you feel like it’s insane to sell -sell. When you see it dropping like a stone and all the articles are talking about how dead it is (if they’re talking about it at all) and it seems stupid to buy - buy.
As far as fortune telling goes, I think we get back to 20,000 USD Btc sometime in the first quarter of 2021.  The next ath beyond that will be late 2021 or early 2022 with a peak of 314k. So you have time to accumulate.

Good luck.
Beyond that, I’m not sure what else could be done.
@_date: 2019-10-26 05:57:07
Of course
@_date: 2019-10-18 18:46:04
Agreed. The US government has mishandled the taxation of bitcoin. 
We can only hope/petition for a revision or reversal in the future.
In the meantime, this opens up the door for a third party (or parties) to create an app to seamlessly streamline bitcoin purchases, incorporate taxes and record/document them for capital gains purposes.
@_date: 2019-06-26 23:56:04
Prone to FOMO?
@_date: 2019-06-25 16:14:30
Don’t people use banks? Lol
There’s no doubt there is a huge problem with student loan debt.  I’m just concerned that whatever plan that gets put together ends up failing to address the issue, and at the cost of US taxpayers.  This is from a recent Forbes article;
“With Warren’s plan, households with an income under $100,000 would have up to $50,000 in student loan debt forgiven, but forgiveness would be phased out for households who earn between $100,000 and $250,000. Finally, households with incomes higher than $250,000 will have no loans forgiven.
Due to the way this plan is set up, a family with two doctors and top tier earnings would be left to fend for themselves. This is despite the fact they probably spent 8+ years in school so they could learn to save people’s lives.
On the flip side, someone who borrowed $150,000 for a bachelor’s degree in general studies and works only part-time would likely see some of their loans forgiven. How fair is that?”
“Even Elizabeth Warren admits her plans would cost $1.2 trillion over ten years — a tab taxpayers are expected to handle on top of everything else.”
@_date: 2019-06-25 16:02:14
What are the ramifications of wiping away 1.5 trillion dollars in student loan debt? How does affect schools? How does it affect the economy?
@_date: 2019-10-25 17:35:52
Yeah, why did you sell?
I always tell people don’t put in any more than you can afford to part with. That way there’s no temptation to sell if you run low on funds.
Think of it as going out to dinner, or going to a movie, or attending an amusement park. 
Buy it and forget it. Repeat when you can. Don’t FOMO buy, don’t panic sell. Slow and steady.  
So when do you sell? That answer is different for everyone. For me, it’s 10x my initial investment. I know that sounds nuts right now, but that’s what I wait for.
@_date: 2019-06-27 18:11:24
That’s one hell of a bear market
@_date: 2019-06-27 18:38:14
It’s anyone’s guess. I think it’ll drop until July 1st.

How does he propose eliminating it?
@_date: 2019-06-26 23:35:36
Let’s be honest.  When it hit 19k again, are you really going to sell and get your money back? Or just hold it for a *little* bit more
@_date: 2019-06-27 18:11:06
So you think an epic rise is to 20k?
@_date: 2019-06-28 17:12:38
I wonder what that could do to the price ��
@_date: 2019-06-21 17:58:30
If she didn’t sell this past December, she’s not selling now
@_date: 2019-06-17 22:25:23
It’s impossible to say with any certainty
@_date: 2019-06-27 02:31:32
Wow. Good luck
@_date: 2019-06-26 23:36:56
@_date: 2019-06-27 18:34:16
I am. Can’t really blame the folks who sold though.  Bitcoin had a parabolic rise.  A correction was inevitable and it is natural.
@_date: 2019-06-26 23:37:14
When’s his lunch date with Justin Sun?
@_date: 2019-06-27 02:35:33
If you can do without all your savings, yeah go for it.  On a long enough timeline, I think bitcoin goes way up from here.  But in the short/medium term - who knows. I would’ve done half maybe.
@_date: 2019-12-12 18:32:57
Obviously no one can say with any certainty, so it’s all a guess.
That being said, I can give you my guess. Bitcoin will probably drop to somewhere around 5600-6400 as a low within the next couple of weeks/months. Should be a nice little pump after that.  
How high that will be, I can’t even guess yet.
@_date: 2019-06-22 02:17:40
I have some real advice for you. Absolutely NO ONE knows if bitcoin is about to drop back down to 9k or go up to 11k in the next hour or day.  NO ONE knows what the price will be in a week, month or year.  
I bought some today at 9800.  Bitcoin is on the rise and many think that it’ll hit $100,000 in a few years, including me.
If it hits 100,000, will it matter that you bought at 9k or 11k? No. But it will matter if you never bought at all. 
Buy today, spend what you can do without for a year or so and come back and evaluate. Whatever you can afford.  I look at the expense the same as a night out to dinner, drinks, movies entertainment etc 
Good luck
@_date: 2019-12-31 04:08:58
Why’d you sell?
@_date: 2019-12-31 18:41:54
On the decade too
@_date: 2019-12-31 04:21:11
And my .02, but I think you’ll be able to buy it for less than the current price in 30’days.
@_date: 2019-12-31 04:09:11
Right, right, of course.

From the first wiki article
“Creating a quantum computer is a massive scientific and engineering challenge. As of 2019, the largest general-purpose quantum computers have fewer than 100 qubits, have impractically-high error rates, and can operate only in lab conditions at temperatures near absolute zero. Attacking Bitcoin keys would require around 1500 qubits. Humanity currently does not have the technology necessary to create a quantum computer large enough to attack Bitcoin keys. It is not known how quickly this technology will advance; however, cryptography standards such as ECRYPT II tend to say that Bitcoin's 256-bit ECDSA keys are secure until at least 2030-2040.
There is a company called D-Wave which claims to produce quantum computers with over 2000 qubits. However, this claim has not been universally accepted, and even if it is true, this is a special-purpose "annealing quantum processor" incapable of attacking crypto.”
Sounds incredibly speculative at this point.
@_date: 2019-12-31 04:01:04
So....you’ve come here to say that “bitcoin is about to go to the moon” because you just sold some for a loss?
What am I missing here?
@_date: 2019-04-21 15:26:18
I’d like to know this as well.  Does anyone have an real world example that they routinely do to exchange bitcoin for a good or service?
@_date: 2019-04-24 14:36:42
Good, there’s another dip to buy
@_date: 2019-04-21 16:09:54
I’ve read about Bitify.com, but I haven’t used it.
@_date: 2019-04-05 16:24:46
I’m holding and buying.  Unless your day trading or flat broke, why would you sell?
@_date: 2019-04-09 18:34:14
I don’t think it’s dumb question, but this is highly improbable. There are 195 countries.   There are also international waters, “micronations” (like sealand) and disputed zones. I imagine a company like space x could create and launch an orbiting space station to mine bitcoin outside of the jurisdictions, lol.
This is the beauty of bitcoin. It can’t be stopped unless you stop the internet itself.
@_date: 2019-04-15 14:42:12
Every action has an equal and opposite reaction
@_date: 2019-04-07 03:47:06
I think the first layer of security is concealment.  How can you steal something you don’t know is there? If you keep your mouth shut, no one should know you have cryptocurrency to take.  
I’d also say if your are doing that well financially with crypto investments, you should be investing in a good safe.
This is just for burglary.
For a “violent burglary”, I’m assuming you mean a home invasion - an event where you are taken hostage. Odds are you weren’t chosen at random. I’m not sure if a safe or a safety deposit will help much either way.
I do know it’s easier to hide a cold wallet than some gold bars. I’d be more concerned that there would be a way my nano ledger could be remotely hacked than anything else.

Welcome to reddit. I posted an article about bitcoin possibly going down the other day as well. After being downvoted, the mods removed it citing - too many articles about bitcoin’s price...oh...ok.
I guess if you think there’s another dip or even another yearly low on the horizon, you’re an idiot spreading FUD cause you missed the bottom and you’ll FOMO in at 10k.
Tread carefully with independent thinking and analysis. The group has spoken. The bull run is here. That is all.
@_date: 2019-09-29 04:01:40
Oh sweetie...
@_date: 2019-09-24 19:58:28
I’m thinking around a 6500 bottom?
@_date: 2019-09-24 15:45:18
So not much more
@_date: 2019-09-16 12:55:58
Doesn’t matter if bitcoin hangs around 10k indefinitely. It’ll never be the ATH.

There’s many issues right now.  Like volatility and scalability among others .  I’m an advocate of cryptocurrency adoption, but shouldn’t the entire community be concerned that if bitcoin isn’t ready for adoption at this moment because of these issues, that it’ll scare away the very institutions we need to convince to use it?
@_date: 2019-05-19 19:42:16
I bought at Coinbase in the spring of 2017. Other then the initial vetting process, I’ve had zero hassle, problems or concerns.
I also use binance, bitstamp, and Bittrex.  And I rank them in that order too.
Don’t overthink it too much. 
What do you want to do? Day trade? Long term holder? Exchange it for alt coins?  There is no perfect exchange.
