I will say that I reread a couple of Dan Millmans books every year “Way of the Peaceful Warrior”. The story and lessons told during his series are heavily influenced by the philosopherAlan Watts. Most importantly living in the “now” without any distraction of the past or future is something that I’ve been working on for a long time now. As I have said earlier today crypto is a catalyst for my life. While I’m happy if it’s worth more at the end of the day, I’m just as happy knowing that I’m not being complacent in life.

Those values have been apart of me for a long time. I may have lost sight of them temporarily, but they were always there.  I can thank my parents, coaches, and mentors for that. Sometimes you just feel that you’re at a turning point in your life. This is one of those moments, and it’s up to me to make the most of it. You are correct, bitcoin is just a catalyst for me, although I do believe in the technology, and will one day use it as currency. Until that time comes though I’ll just keep working on myself and hodl away.

Thank you! I don’t plan on stopping. I may portion it differently, but I still like seeing the amount of bitcoin I have going up. As for pole vault it’s the one thing on this planet that has brought me the most joy. I just have always felt right flying through the air.

Of course I alway max out my companies match for my 401k.

Thank you! I’m trying to get back into competing again for Track and Field. Between 2011-2013 I was training with an Olympic coach with hopes of qualifying for the trials in Pole vault. Shortly after I lost my business, and all motivation to do much of anything. True depression is hell. It’s been a climb back up since then, so we’ll see where life takes me.

Yes both of them are having/had multiple surgeries since October.  They are unable to lift, or do any house maintenance really. Also, they live on 11 acres and have quite a few farm animals, so I help manage everything as best as I can. I actually walked away from my job with the Hyatt, and moved across the country in order to help them out. They live in quite a rural area, and the nearest Hyatt is about 2 hours one way away. Hence why I work at a nearby warehouse (10 mins away). You only get one Mom and one Dad, so I felt overall it was the right thing to do.

Currently, I’m a case sealer for a high volume book distributor. However I’ll make my way back into hotel and hospitality once my parents get back on their feet.

That something I should have considered thanks for pointing that out. I’m 26 so that still has a lot of time to grow.

My lucky “bit-dime”. That alone already feels sentimental. Thank you for the kind words.

Regardless, my money that I’ve “invested” would have been used in a much more careless way. I can’t find any harm in the way that I’m doing things now. Even if bitcoin tanks to 10$ I will still come out ahead due to the changes that’s it’s helped me make.

That is exactly my point that I had leveraged in an earlier conversation here. At the end of the day those are positive changes that can’t be taken away, and I’m content with that. Everything else beyond that is just a bonus.

While I understand this is a lot of money, I would still refuse to perform any heinous act... whatever it may be. Im not bashing OP, however in the future this has potential to become a real scenario. At the end of the day no matter how big BTC gets, hold strong to your morals.
