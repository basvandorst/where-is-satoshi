First thing you can do for yourself is to stop looking at Tor as some invisibility cloak, it's not, using it makes you stand out like a sore thumb and draw greater scrutiny from those very same algorithms that mentions.

I find it very humerus that you don't buy bitcoin because of what happens on @_date: 2015-12-16 17:27:05
I don't use coinbase as a wallet for this reason.  If you know you're going to be spending, put some on a hot wallet you control ahead of time.

Downvoting me would send me to the bottom if there was other content worth more.  The default sort order of posts is not set to controversial.

Cut up your Chase cards and stop supporting shitty to big to fail banks.

Sucks to be you.

It would depend on who was at war with whom.

I didn't mean it monetarily.

We have no idea what the internet will look like in that time frame.  It may become impervious to anything we can do to it in that time.
  
It's hard to imagine a scenario that affects bitcoins ability to continue where I would care about what happens to bitcoin.  If there is a world war, the internet will go on lock down and bitcoin will fork all over the place, but will you care at that point?  Worst case scenario, we would end up with multiple bitcoin blockchains.  Maybe in the future when there was peace, people who held before the forks would suddenly find their coins could be used on any of those chains.  I could see China having its own fork and the miners there never abandoning it because they became so invested in that fork during the war.  It would certainly be interesting.

That's a bug on bitcoinwisdom.  If you click Huobi, the price will change to much lower.

The comparison was between bitcoins and raffle tickets not mining and raffle tickets.

I think you're confused.  I wouldn't otherwise donate to wikipedia.  I would only donate because they are honoring my favorite currency, not because I want them to survive.  My life would continue on just fine if they shut down and I am positive others would fill the gap.
@_date: 2015-12-15 16:19:57
Bitcoin and raffle tickets are nothing alike, your comparison sucks.
@_date: 2015-12-14 17:44:31
I like it the way it is.

I like your optimism, unfortunately I cannot afford it.  I'll reward behavior, not the hope for some form of it.
@_date: 2015-12-15 16:17:09
Fairly certain that is not the case with openbazaar.
@_date: 2015-12-15 16:24:51
I really hope not!  I need time to accumulate some coins!

Pick a realistic scenario and I'll play.  The US is a far superior military and that won't change in the event of economic collapse.  How exactly is famine going to happen?  We make way more food than we can eat and export a lot.

No he didn't.

No.  Download the source for bitaddress.org from github and run it offline.

I'll donate when they make the bitcoin option as prominent as PayPal.
