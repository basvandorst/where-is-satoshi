Can't we have both?

Right now an average house is about 50btc.

You can't be a part of the solution if you don't have enough money or even the understanding of what is needed to resolve the issue.

I like to think so. So far I've personally put in more investment funds than all but one investor.

Anyone else find it odd that [this guy]( runs btc-china? 
@_date: 2014-03-15 17:17:30
They don't, they stop taking bitcoin due to the loss, and we're back at square one (See Baidu).

Kraken is licensed in quite a few states.

The moneychangers of Jesus time were like visa and MasterCard. When merchants would travel to an area they would either require payment or have to convert their currency to the local one. Currency changers would go around and build false information about the currencies so they would be devalued. Sometimes the poor and merchants would lose 50% of their money value to the exchangers. Jesus overturned their tables because they had turned a temple into a market and were using that location to further rip people off.
  
Sound like anyone today?

Last year my brother's company was hit with over $50,000 in attempted CC fraud.
Do you think that bitcoin will somehow filter out those who want to try and perform fraudulent activities because of ethics? No, people will try to scam any way possible, doublespends included.

My family's rate went from $250&gt;$350 for significantly worse benefits, and a deductible that increased 10 times.

Time to buy some more houses with bitcoin!
@_date: 2014-03-15 17:13:36
$1m out of $2b in yearly sales is.........sad.

I thought bitcoin was immune to wallstreet control like everything else?
@_date: 2014-04-17 14:32:30
Actually coinbase allows for more than $50k/day buys and sells. If you're a very large business they could do significantly more.
@_date: 2014-10-05 14:57:05
Yet many, many , many have proposed it here that things need to solely be valued in btc.
I run a company and we deal with a USD/BTC tie, and are told time and time again that we're stupid for valuing everything in USD (using BTC as a transfer method).

Possibly, although thus far I've bought 5 houses via bitcoin and set to close on  in a week or so.
@_date: 2014-10-31 13:53:39
Remember Cyprus?
  
Started at 500k that would get a haircut. Then it was 250k, then 100k and by the end people with balances as low as 50k were seeing withdraws and penalties. 
  
This all will get out of control and we will be lucky to live through it.

$50,000 would get you registered legally in one or two states.
No coding done on the site whatsoever.

Looks like they're more than happy to throw Gox under the bus.
I'm kind of surprised they got BTC-China, bitstamp, kraken and others to all sign it. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 03:07:01
I agree. However this statement surely distances the other exchanges as far as possible from Gox. 
@_date: 2017-03-27 03:32:03
Unfortunately these costs make it very difficult for my business to conduct transfers in bitcoin anymore. We sent a transfer for funds about a week ago and I had no clue that fees had gone up so much. After several hours on IRC I finally figured out how to change the fee so it could become unlocked. To me, that isn't significantly different than the various freezing issues I've had with paypal in the past.

Maybe I'm crazy, but I've been able to buy drugs from Canada for a while that were quite cheap. For the most part it hasn't been illegal to do since they were for legitimate use and I had a doctors prescription. 
@_date: 2017-04-17 14:01:34
Depending on what the fees would be at that specific time, Paypal could have been cheaper to send that person. 
On some of the transactions I've sent recently the fee has been well over 5%.

SEC requires a great deal of filing to be done in order to participate in the new micro exchanges. It will cost a company around $15,000 to do it along with compliance and financial audits.
  Havelock/bitfunder/BTCT was $500 and a written mission statement.
@_date: 2016-10-25 14:33:35
Correct. He was big on taking money from the banking class whom he determined to be Jews and to give it to the middle working classes.

If fidelity handles this like they do investment accounts you'll be able to pay with bitcoin at any place that takes visa or MasterCard by their auto balance program that lets you have money in an account investments rather than cash. This is pretty big.

This is why I love small federal governments. On a smaller level/state level, there's so much more flexibility to get stuff done, rather than a bulky federal government who can kill so much so quick.

Around 6,000btc via bitbet is in escrow.

Still waiting on lawyer opinion about it.

Bitcoin exclusively, however the county may require $ involved in the transaction for it to be binding.
@_date: 2013-11-15 14:53:03
What I don't understand is this - 
Paper money, silver, gold and the like ALL can come from illicit sources. Heck, here in the US it's estimated that 90% of all $20 bills have circulated through a drug dealer's hands at one time.
So, I'm curious, how they think that this is somehow the right alternative. Of course, with this case the developer (Mellon) thinks that it's something the marketplace wants. However hopefully it will become painfully obvious that it is something it does not want.

Partially that, partially that BFL has screwed many, many credit card processors out of hundreds of thousands of dollars.

For legalities -You NEED an attorney to write the contracts, even more so when dealing with bitcoins.
Safety - I have no clue how they are running larger value transactions but i would make sure your contract is iron clad. With real estate you *should* be able to provide a clause for the event of them not sending the money.
Taxes - I don't know about Canada, but in the US if you hold your home as a primary residence for several years, you can sell it with up to a $500,000 profit without paying taxes. Ask an accountant about this, it is my thinking that Canada has something somewhat similar.

There aren't any available that accept businesses locally.

Any specific products that the BTC community needs? We're going to release a Ecig product &amp; refills that can be bought via bitcoins. Not sure on what else I could release that'd be useful.

Pretty decent margin if you ask me. 1hr to put it together and maybe 30m to drive it to the post office (Or you could just have USPS/UPS/Fedex  pick it up at your house for free).

I don't think that's enough to raise flags at their bank. Likely it's gonna be in the $50k-$100k/mo range that you'll start to raise flags.

Some altcoins (Feathercoin, I'm looking at you) have upper/lower limits on difficulty increases due to pump and dump strategies that are used on it. At one time, the time to re-adjust difficulty was in the term of months, because no one was mining it anymore.

He's accepted bitcoin for quite some time now. If he went to bitcoins exclusively he'd loose about 90% of his business,.
