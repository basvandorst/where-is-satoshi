I have a Virtual Visa Debit my Canadian bank gave me, I try to add it to withdraw my money and it tells me "We believe this is a credit card, if it isn't send us a message." then every time I message them I get the same irrelevant automated message saying "We don't allow you to add credit cards, prepaid credit cards, reloadable credit cards"  etc.  without addressing the fact that it is a debit card lol

Hey there, I've been doing some reading, but am not sure what is better. Paper wallet or a laptop that was never connected to the internet as a cold storage. I watched a video series and they guy went from a Mac to a Linux OS (he said this minimizes any risk of being infected with malware). 
I'm not very good at security stuff but I'm learning a lot every day, I just don't want to get into a lot more BTC and have vulnerabilities in my security for my coins.

Serious question - any idea how they would store them? What's the absolute most secure way to store bitcoins? If someone has like  1-5 bitcoins, should they invest in the TREZOR thing or what should they do?

Let's say I had a laptop as a cold storage, it gets hit by an EMP, isn't that what the backup key words are for?

Oh wow that's really awesome, didn't know that. Hey, maybe you would know this - how do people get careers in Bitcoin? What are they studying? Cryptography? Are they Economists? Programmers? Computer Scientists? 
I just really want to learn more about Bitcoin, but it seems that rather than just study Bitcoin itself, I can study other fields to understand Bitcoin more in depth, do you know what I could study to understand Bitcoin much more deeply? 
I enjoy listening to Andreas Antonopoulos, but I always wonder how I can understand Bitcoin to the extent he does. I just want to learn.
