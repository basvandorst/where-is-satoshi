onename looks super cool but it takes 3 hours for it to commit registration and the pass phrase is super long.

Hello.  As soon as you signup, you are in the queue.  We hate wait lists - we want people to use our product as soon as possible.  However, we received a lot of interest and are inviting people as fast as we can.

You can register without any invite link.  Invite link is only needed if you want to link your bank account.

Circle's price has 1% spread built in.  Compare it to coinbase or sfox.com and you will see the fees.  Still not bad compared to the old ways.

At a minimum, cointag should email users when their address is changed; this will help if cointag account is hijacked by someone.

Is that open to everyone?  My understanding is, they are only open to members and then everyone has to buy and sell from members.

Hello.  I am one of the developers of sf-ox.com and happy to answer any questions.
To clarify, we are not selling Bitcoins below market price.  We are taking advantage of the fact that there is no market price for Bitcoin.  This means, different exchanges trade Bitcoin at different prices.  We evaluate multiple exchanges and buy the coin at the cheapest price (or sell the coin at the highest price) possible.

Banks should look at Bitcoin as an opportunity.  Essentially, only one bank in a country needs to adopt Bitcoin to convert from Fiat to Bitcoin  Whichever bank moves first will most likely win.

Since trading happens on exchanges, we are not able to offer multi-sig option.  Any bitcoin we hold ourselves is protected by hardware security solution.

this is called a central system with APIs.  Why use a blockchain if you don't want everyone to participate.
