Using functions with more than 200 lines of code, containing multiple loops with conditional paths. How in the world can you ever unit test this!

Scam site, just look the url.

Copay is a great bitcoin wallet. On iOS it's my favorite. However, the QR code scanner is not as good as it can be yet, see this Github ticket:

I get the impression that there is a big quality difference of Mycellium between IOS and Android. I have used Mycellium on IOS and stopped using it because the transaction history is worthless. The amount in BTC mentioned are not the netto amounts transferred or received. It does not take into account output returned to your own wallet, giving the impression that a lot larger transactions has taken place. Also the application has stopped working several times (it hangs).

Did you check Copay for IOS? Is seems like a good and secure alternative for Breadwallet.

Dell probably has converted the BTC directly into dollars using a third party service provider. So they do not have the BTC anymore to send back. It makes sense for them to refund the amount in dollars.

Just reported this SCAM at Apple support. How difficult can it be to check the developer website before approving an app.

Customers get a 10% discount when they pay with bitcoin instead of euro's. See their [services link](

Will the halving effect the bitcoin price? I ask this because the transacted bitcoin volume on exchanges is much higher than the newly generated bitcoins by miners.

I have contacted Github support with the issue, hopefully they can remove the fake repo
@_date: 2016-10-09 15:12:56
It is VERY suspicious that the corresponding github accounts are only a few days old and have no commits. You would expect that stable and production ready software is at least a couple of months old with hundreds of commits. 
@_date: 2016-10-09 09:30:10
I reported both repos as Scam on Github. Hopefully they will  be removed asap.
@_date: 2016-10-09 09:32:54
How can Apple approve Bitcoin wallets with their website linking to a Github repo which is only a few days old. You KNOW that they must be a scam. Real github repos are at least months and often years old to create a stable and production ready application.

The "Bitcoin Ticker" App on IOS has the option to set (multiple) alarm(s) when price reaches certain value (absolute) or increase in price (relative)
