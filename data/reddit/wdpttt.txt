Hey, Cocosoft!
Thanks for that tip (:

They at least say that exists the possibility to have an offline wallet. I'm new to bitcoin, but what does "cold" mean?
@_date: 2014-11-14 10:34:02
Why shocking? I think bitcoin community is a lot good, you can see all the tips given on reddit.
@_date: 2014-11-07 17:26:37

The miners will be supported by the commissions of the transactions made. When you make a transaction you can say how much you want to give as commission, based on that you will have your transaction as *valid* (into the public blockchain)

I understand that physical time traveling is hard... But what about digital time traveling?
@_date: 2014-11-10 09:16:46

Hope so. Hope "they" allow us to, without starting a war, justified by the danger of bitcoin.

Every seconds it passes, mining coins is harder. Now reached a point that is really really difficult and not worth with your PC. There are special machines dedicated to mining.

Will you make the same for bitcoins? Good luck!

This would be a game that involves bitcoins, so I thought would be interesting to have the audience to name the logo. (There are just 4 clicks, you just have to click on what you like, not to think)
@_date: 2014-11-11 12:05:39
You can now name them, so we all know who is behind 
@_date: 2014-10-12 00:20:25


what does that mean?


How can I do that? I've seen other sites and nothing showed up about it

|One potential solution is a “paper wallet.” This involves printing off a piece of paper that shows the keys to your BitCoin Wallet, using a QR code to make it easy for transactions. This paper wallet means that you are not vulnerable to any malware, computer failures or other cyber attacks, as it is a physical key. However, being a physical piece of paper means that it is vulnerable to all of the same things that regular money is, such as wear over time, fire, water damage, loss and so on.
