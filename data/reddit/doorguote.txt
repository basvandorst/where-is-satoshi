Well obviously, but I think the point of a cumulative graph is to visually note rates of change by the slopes of the lines. To me this graph doesn't show an exponential increase in the last year or so, but rather a steady linear upswing in transactions.

What I did is saved the bit address generator offline, ran Ubuntu from a flash drive offline, generated paper wallets, printed them via direct connection to the printer (not over the network), deleted the address program, and voilà, a relative secure paper wallet

Makes sense! And by "public key" you mean, for my sake with a printed out paper wallet from bitaddress.org, the "bitcoin address"?? Sorry I'm fairly new... I appreciate your help a lot.
@_date: 2013-08-07 17:46:09


This, a million times! This is the sentiment that should be the crux of any argument supporting bitcoin use by vendors. The only hurdle in the way of widespread use is how to handle payment addresses. [This episode]( of *Let's Talk Bitcoin!* elaborates on that current hurdle, and some future solutions to overcome it.

*Me* arrogant? You attack somebody ad hominem for not agreeing with your worldview.

I've started tweeting  facts about bitcoin he seemed to be misrepresenting on his colbert interview. If you want to drop some truths on him, such as actual positive functions of BTC, ease of transaction (private and through sites), etc. Send him a truth nugget by tweeting something at 
@_date: 2013-05-03 02:26:15
So, using bitaddres.org, I generated a paper wallet, which contains a unique public/private key combination (represented as two separate QRs) that are mathematically linked.   I print this out and keep it safe in my home. Now, if you're new to bitcoin, you may peruse on over to coinbase.com, and do a bitcoin purchase straight from your linked checking account. Once you receive the funds in your temporary coinbase wallet, you can send them to your paper wallet by entering the public address of the wallet (one of the two long-digits codes on the paper). This wallet now is worth something. You can even write the amount on some of the bills for your own good. Now, when you send money from the paper wallet using any number of sites such as blockchain, you must enter the destination of your bitcoins you want to send, as well as the private code (the other number on your "bill"). The paper wallet has now just sent money. Paper wallets work best if you have a large sum of bitcoins, you don't plan on spending them (investment sort of thing), or both. They ate just a hassle to keep remaking every time you need to move money (you have to empty the paper wallet every time you want to send bitcoins from it, meaning if I want to send address x 2 of my 4 coins, I need to send the other 2 to another blank paper wallet I just generated, since paper wallets can't do partial "empties", if you will)

Makes sense now! So by randomly creating a password these programs use that algorithm to create the public address from it. If that's the case can't the same algorithm back calculate the password from the public address or is it only a one-way street?
@_date: 2013-04-20 15:06:04
(a) Already contacted them.
(b) Bringing the issue to a public forum such as reddit has helped pressure coinbase to at least respond to the community as a whole (see the past few days of coinbase posts).

Does blockchain only read a QR if the account has money on it? Thanks for the app review!! I appreciated seeing it.
@_date: 2013-04-16 16:33:46
Have you had good luck with it so far? I have paper wallets produced using bitaddress.org, and when trying to QR scan them using scanbook i always get the "invalid QR code" message.
EDIT: Just read some reviews on the iOS app store:
"When scanning a new address it shows hte new one for a split second, then goes right back to the previous one. Please fix. Other than that it's a great app, but this bug makes it useless for now."
Can you do me a favor and tell me if this problem is happening to you too? I'm having the same issue.

This is exactly what regulators should think about long and hard before making a rash move. Prohibition, the drug war, etc show that crackdowns often solve nothing except making criminals out of law-abiding customers.

Totally agreed. Time is money, and sometimes the fees are worth the assurance of getting your coins when you want them. With such a volatile period, a debate on 4% vs 1% fees is moot when that fluctuation happens every 15 minutes. Time is more important than fees at the moment.

No, ad hominem would've been me saying "you sound so silly with your argument, plus you didn't even go to college you sack of shit." That would've been irrelevant to the conversation, but, yet a personal attack. My observation was only on your argument at hand and how silly and illogical it is.

Do you know if that "hurdle rate" of, say, 5%, applies to 5% profit per trade? Per month? Per year? Basically, I'm asking: if i do a single trade that makes 7%, does that trigger my 20% profit, or do I use the cumulative profit to-date in that year, and once it exceeds 5%, I begin making profit?

Assume I'm the village idiot: What is the API and how do I access  it?
@_date: 2013-07-17 02:46:37
Ahh, I may have found a competent theory: Because of Camp BX's association with Dwolla, which is a very "liquid" monetary transfer company, the price is more reflective of the actual price. With Mt. Gox, more nodes are required when transferring funds out, which may eat up more fees, and thus, equalize at the end of the day.
@_date: 2013-07-17 01:58:36
Are you sure? The price has been slightly higher since before the Mt. Gox freeze. Also, it's not just the bids, it is the ask prices as well---equally higher for Mt. Gox.

I posted a rant the other day (negative experience with coinbase) in which I detailed a transaction I made for about $77/BTC. The transaction (checking account-linked) was set to go through, the price was $115+. The transaction was cancelled due to "high risk". After thoroughly explaining my situation to a coinbase representative via e-mail, they actually credited the bitcoins into my account at the original USD price! It was such a wonderful surprise. I was jaded by my bad experience, but it quickly turned into the realization that their customer service is amazing. Thanks coinbase! Recommendation: If someone's transaction is flagged as "high risk", it would be great if you had an automatic e-mail response as to what constituted the high risk so users aren't left scratching their heads.

I wonder if it has to do with mistyping/mishandling of pi bloc addresses? The mt gox account number is much shorter and probably less prime to transcriptional error when you submit a transaction on bit instant. As someone who did a USD-wallet transaction with bitinstant, I couldn't be happier!

As a user of CampBX, I can attest to how very very liquid this exchange is. Dwolla's partnership with CampBX makes liquidation so fucking easy.
