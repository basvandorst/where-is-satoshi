how to retrieve Bitcoin cash for BTC you already spend on bitcoin blockchain ;
would you use same prv key to sign the tx on Bcash blockchain ?
@_date: 2017-12-21 10:02:46
any good EU exchange with SEPA support?
@_date: 2017-12-21 10:48:17
Yes but bistamp verification lasts months
Mine is still ongoing

@_date: 2017-03-08 16:20:44
source ? or clarification
@_date: 2017-03-25 19:01:10
Thanks! That makes sense. 
Any efficient way to express support to core?  Running a core node? 
@_date: 2017-03-07 10:08:35
correct BUT
 microsoft - in your analogy- Converts BTC to fiat which Creates Volume &amp; thus demand and  encourages bitcoin new buyers because they know they can spend @ microsoft &amp; other big corp

also "acceptance" of any currency lays in its Wide Usage ; not the physical necessity value ; can you drink gold if you're thirsty &amp;out of water ?
@_date: 2017-03-07 09:57:22
fees seems fine to me ; shouldn't take that long ;
did you specify fees automatically ?
Also this lets you find out what are optimal fees for each transaction size : 
@_date: 2017-03-06 08:55:50
Thanks for your replies ;
the point is to find the max - security for most paranoid people ;
hardware wallets such as trezor can be vulnerable to evil maid attack replacing your device with an evil one !
the Piece of paper way works and is the current max-sec available method but is not very convinient;
so the QR code is second Most secure Way is you use a photo to transport it ;
@_date: 2017-03-25 21:06:09
Its the tickers bitfinex chose to apply for the fork
@_date: 2017-03-06 03:27:10
[Update ]
i now know why a connected device is needed to create an unsigned transaction because it has to use unspent transaction outputs accessible online;
source :
1. HOT generats a transaction based on the unspent transaction outputs. But it can't sign the transaction.
2. HOT converts the information needing to be signed in the unsigned transaction into formated signable QR Codes. HOT displays the QR Codes.
3. COLD scans HOT's screen and gets the signable information.
4. COLD finds the right private key that the signable information requires.
5. COLD signs the signable information using the private key.
6. COLD converts the signed information to formated QR Codes and displays them.
7. HOT gets the signed information and attach it onto the unsigned transaction.
8. HOT verifies if the transaction is correctly signed. The transaction will be spread to other peers if it passes the verification.
@_date: 2017-03-07 10:44:58
this is also a good site who predicts when would your transaction confirm (based on fees / net congestion )
@_date: 2017-08-30 13:55:42
bitstamp.com got 6% fees
i remeber cubits.com got really low fees , also bitlish.com
i tested both and was happy

Update : uquid doesnt deliver new cards . They have an issue with their provider
@_date: 2017-11-20 14:54:17
only 150 (1 star ) comments left to overcome the (5 start) count ;
@_date: 2018-06-26 11:37:46
U need to go trough a provider to top up entropay . I guess they do that to clear themselves out.
@_date: 2017-11-20 13:42:33
i made numerous ( maybe 8 transfers to external btc addresses )
; it usually goes from "waiting for approved " user approved" "processing" and "complete" in 3 minutes window ;
maybe there a high backlog of withdrawals ;
let' see what others users think
@_date: 2017-11-20 23:16:38
I dont see stoning anywhere ; the legal references are largely uninforced ; i dont try to insult/mislead. 
I just want to point that making some research and asking real travelers before making unfair / wrong statements as above
@_date: 2017-11-20 23:12:10
Provide logic ;tangible sourced example !
Your argument about stoning women is wrong!
Death penalty is not even enforcement for grand crime...
What else you got?
@_date: 2017-11-20 23:20:19
You are mixings penal code and islam religion which btw has many branches that contradicts each other.
Even within sunni islam.
Kindly mind your languages for insults/mockery
If you're a true freethinker that considers logic / scientific evidence;  you shall reach the truth

if you're genuily interested to educate yourself about the country ;
Kindly do some research ; 
@_date: 2017-11-20 23:29:44
Are you joking? I said there is no stoning or any death oenalty for that matter . I was quiet shocked that when visiting florida i was told one could get into an electric chair for underaged rape which often occurs in the state.
Most moroccans are more allergic / offensive  to some sharia punishments that you may claim to be.
You seem as a troll and therefore would not mind to reply again.
Good night sir

Xapo is really Great ; not supported for US residents BUT i was able to use it like a charm when i traveled there;
@_date: 2017-04-26 14:52:26
or maybe just leave USD within bitfinex until they sort withdrawing process? 
@_date: 2017-04-26 14:52:48
good vibes
@_date: 2017-04-26 15:09:20
do you have source for this?
@_date: 2017-04-03 13:26:14
do same as if you sold something you created in ebay ;
@_date: 2017-04-26 14:53:20
do you think bitfinex pushes the way for other exchangers to follow up on price?
@_date: 2017-04-05 09:41:28
i saw a bitcoin ATM in whitehall terminal (entrance of staten island ferry ) in a diner ;
so you buy in cash ;)

can you please Tell how can one check if his account is verified?
i remember sending over Docs but some users reports that verification expire ;

also wondering
@_date: 2017-04-27 13:10:46
what's USDT , in bitfinex it doesnt mention this ;
any source ?
@_date: 2017-04-18 09:10:34
i used Xapo and wirex and prefer Xapo ;
they got attractive fees , nice Customer support ;
and it's directly converts to fiat when you spent BTC
@_date: 2017-04-10 11:47:42
are those prices BUY bitfinex and SELL to Xtrade?
@_date: 2018-03-09 07:57:44
sorry to hear that man ...
have you tried contacting the registrar / web hosting company  ?
any chance you can bring them to french court and get the judge to order them to reveal attacker identity trough financial information he used to operate the domain ?
you can then sue attacker directly and claim a debt and have his assets seized and auctioned to get your money back ;
Hope this helps ; 
i speak french so please feel free to ask if theres  anything i can do to help
@_date: 2017-09-02 01:53:21
but polonieww doesn trade all btc volume ;
if anything the increase will only affect poloniex
@_date: 2017-09-02 01:52:11
but i can sweep it in let's say in an offline live CD linux electrum ?
@_date: 2017-09-04 14:52:47
invest now and if it drops further and if it drops even further !
that would make your buyin price lower and lower ;
@_date: 2017-09-16 09:35:45
I dont know why hardware wallet USB just bothers me , it allows a theorical link with a connected device and thus is not 100% isolated from internet.
I choose paper wallets + offline android device with bigher cold &amp; offline transaction signing using QR code so private keys are 100% physically isolated !
@_date: 2017-09-02 09:48:38
This is good, thx
@_date: 2017-09-06 10:30:06
yes , the seed can be used in another trezor to access your wallets;
in this case you are more safe to lose trezor than the seed ;

you can test sending to this : 1PAo3Lx6xVwKRbmqpjsNsbwFHFunKEio5V
but i would really recommend testing on litecoin to avoid pating exorbitent fees especially if you're going to make multiple transactions ,

@_date: 2017-09-11 12:38:02
the community should seriously start to consider a potential similar P2P interface as a backup  , as localbitcoins is getting the attention of the politico-finance conglomerate and can be attacked imminently and generating FUD avalanche on crypto markets; 
@_date: 2017-09-05 10:19:02
thanks ; 
note that visa recently restricted debit card service to (EU + turkey + israel ) 
@_date: 2017-09-13 12:48:48
100% agree , now sell all your cryptos to me ?
@_date: 2017-09-05 12:29:37
why would you possibly want to move from bitfinex to coinbase ? if  i may ask ;
i think coinbase's support is very bad and they often suspend accounts
@_date: 2017-09-17 00:36:01
hardware wallets work good now but can be a theorical vulnerability in future as they use USB interface and therefore they're NOT isolated from connected devices
@_date: 2017-09-02 18:42:25
First congrats and wish u luck.
You can try bitstamp or another exchange (bitfinex) using SEPA which is eq. For ACH transfer in europe.
Also if i were you i would use 2-3 different exchanges and split 2 cahsout tx per exchange to total 6 transactions in total.
Localbitcoins.com also usable for (5000-10 000€)  tx range as they use escrow for online listings.
@_date: 2017-09-02 02:32:55
thx for your suggestions
@_date: 2017-10-10 13:49:36
Do you have an example ?
@_date: 2017-09-20 10:24:48
what do you use to login trought hitbtc ? [email+password]?
what happens when you click forgot password ? 
- do they just send the reset link over email ? do they ask to confirm phone ?
you said hacker was able to activate new 2FA method , did you have one already activated? i tought only one 2FA method is allowed to be activated at once ? is that the case for hitbtc?
i think a good security measure is lock up withdrawals to limited addresses + limit login IP address range in addition to 2FA;
also SMS 2FA should not be used dure to recent issues;
@_date: 2017-09-23 19:32:48
That would only stop broadcasting the transactions 
@_date: 2017-10-14 12:39:04
Not yet ; I'll simply keep btc then amd trade to get even more.
If u know any service plz let me know 
@_date: 2017-09-02 01:11:42
i'm only using them because their debit card's balance is in BTC and not fiat , along with good exchange rate ;
but it seems like they're taking advantage of the fixed tx fee they charge all their customers and paying cents in reality ...
@_date: 2017-09-02 01:51:16
electrum doesnt work good in smartphones ; correct me if imm wrong but last t i checked no support for :
-offline tx signing -watch wallet only -custom fees
@_date: 2017-10-29 20:21:34
bitfinex is only platform protecting users with replay protection ;
@_date: 2017-09-04 14:32:24
Thanks guys for your input, I'm going to contact xapo support and see what they can do about this.
@_date: 2017-10-02 12:06:49
Xapo is fine for EU/IL/TU ;
as visa stopped issuing cards for non EU ; advcash (mastercard based) is a good price-quality (5$ for one 1st year)
@_date: 2017-09-11 13:59:20
Does it work the same way ? Escrow to hold seller bitcoins until he releases or until buyer shows proof of payment to arbitrator ??
@_date: 2017-10-10 13:49:57
it's in news section within advcash user profile page ;
@_date: 2017-09-05 07:57:41
please know :
this happened hundreds of time ; please stop worrying and relax ;
perhaps if you can afford but some when it slightly dips a bit more ( that lowers you entry price ) ;
also know you can't possibly make profit that easily , it needs time and patience ; but it's a good opportunity to get your stress/nerves calm.
Good luck
Remindme! 15 days !
@_date: 2017-10-29 20:41:51
If you make a transaction on b2x chain , it should not happen also on core chain!!
@_date: 2017-05-20 13:00:29
electrum should have implemented a feature preventing users for using that seed.
if you notice transaction log , attacker got better at reducing delay between deposit and theft to as little as few seconds !
@_date: 2017-05-17 16:51:03
Exactly my point,  now how can merchants accept a payment method that is taking 7% fees for anything under 25$?!
also can anyone confirm if your first ever btc transaction was more than 25$?
This discourages new comers!
So i frankly expect a crisis that will ultimately lead us to a scaling solution, in a painful way to pay the price for the delay.
@_date: 2017-05-22 10:41:49
Yes. Those will not cash out for years.
The drop i mentionned is of course temporary
@_date: 2017-05-12 03:33:50
Cubits.com or bitstamp using sepa
@_date: 2017-05-30 08:08:22
can anyone shortly explain what's the difference between a normal and pruned node ?
is it just disk space Usage ?
i though i didnt have to download whole blockchain ...
@_date: 2017-05-27 19:08:59
thanks for your suggestion ; i tested coinimi and it allows to setup a watch-only wallet but cannot be used as always offline cold storage because it lacks the option to *import an unsigned tx trough QR code*
i'm testing bither and it does 100% of what i specified expect for litecoin compatibility
@_date: 2017-05-06 02:07:01
wow thanks for sharing this , i suppose ultrabtc is also a scam site;
as they pay trough paypal , can't victims just chargeback? or at least report to paypal?
@_date: 2017-05-22 14:01:57
this still can delay / complicate the process .
and confusion causes investors to run to LITECOIN which already got Segwit and is 4X faster than bitcoin ;
with a theorical capacity of 40 tx / second.
@_date: 2017-05-16 17:55:18
how about using litecoin ? i tried 0 fee transaction and got confirmed in 3 minutes ...
@_date: 2017-05-25 01:35:52
amazing formulas , thanks !
@_date: 2017-05-11 07:37:50
i agree ; it looks like a ponzi scheme to buy something costing thousand of dollars the keeps 'rising' in value ...
@_date: 2017-05-17 16:13:53
What are the fees for bitpanda? Credit card purchase 
@_date: 2017-05-11 02:02:25
It works like a charm! 
@_date: 2017-05-23 08:58:29
would that count as supporting segwit ? would that be beneficial to the cause?
@_date: 2017-05-19 12:30:09
which bitcoin cards are you using if i may ask ?
@_date: 2017-05-27 09:55:45
The same thing i can  say about trezor. Someone gains physical access and tampers with hardware.
Trezor may also be vulnerable to malware exploits that update malicious code trough usb
@_date: 2017-05-20 12:37:36
no idea why people keep coins on their platform ;
@_date: 2017-05-20 12:10:53
OMG , are those russian characters !
pishing is fraud so don't do this and dont sell it on darkweb ;
@_date: 2017-05-06 01:41:25
bitblum.com also seems to sell you BTC with Current rate &amp; no fees using paypal or skrill ;
"your 1000 USD will be converted to 0.65104591 BTC and sent to your bitcoin address[...]"
1000/0.65104591  = 1535$
which is still very Low
@_date: 2018-04-27 11:05:24
That works for me now too. But cards were very useful
@_date: 2017-05-20 12:07:24
actually a price correction is imminent i suppose shotly after hovering around 2000 ; then the first drop would stabilise around 1600 before the weak hands would let go and trigger a second sharper Drop that would settle around 1100 - 1300 ;
@_date: 2017-05-25 01:37:52
true !
better set up an alert instead of a SL then decide what to do when it's triggered
@_date: 2017-05-19 08:26:35
can you just deposit crypto ? no fiat ?
what are deposit / withdrawal fees ?
@_date: 2017-05-12 22:50:28
*coinbase : good rates but only accept 22 countries
*bitstamp : 8% fees for debit cards
*coinmama :15% market price above other exchanges
*cex.io : 3.5% fees buying trough Debit cards but 10% market price above other exchanges (
*cubits.com : 2.5% fees but tough video ID verification
*bitlish.com : 4% fees 
@_date: 2017-05-17 13:21:48
cubits.com (germany-based) remains the best Site for European buyers who want instant buy (  but not trading)
coinbase have good fees but only accepts 22 countries and randomly blocks accounts.
@_date: 2017-05-22 09:17:44
Stop loss orders even for hodlers,  u can always get into the market for a lower price later.
Orders quantity should not be over 20 % of your equity so you'll also dollar cost average the losses.
Also update the stop loss from time to time so move up with the price.
The crash is going to be violent and quick and on multiple waves so put alert notification when it happens ( a % variance rather than a price) 
@_date: 2017-05-22 15:57:44
Good point
@_date: 2017-05-23 08:08:44
What prune mean?  Can they run without 150gb space requirement? Would be a huge push if electrum-like node apps are available 
@_date: 2017-05-22 13:32:13
awaiting to get a hardware wallet ; Please buy a small amount (50£) and practise to set multiple offline wallets by :
-Downloading ubuntu and setting USB to boot live OS;
-Boot Ubuntu and Use electrum to generate 4-5 wallets
 and write down their 14 words seeds in safety;
-copy master public key for 2 wallets (cold storage) and set other (3 wallets as online wallets) and try to practise transactions ;
-try to google to see how to sign a transaction offline and then broadcast it to network
@_date: 2017-05-15 09:29:27
Offline wallet storage :
1-Get Linux Live CD iso and make a bootable USB drive
2-Download Electrum zip and put on separate USB drive
3-switch off wireless connexions &amp; Boot into live USB
4- plud the 2nd drive and put extract the zip in Desktop
5-launch electrum ".\electrum" &gt; create new wallet &gt; write down the 12 seeds generated &gt; wallet is now created ;
6-save a couple of public address trough QR code
7-save master public key to import a "watch-only" wallet later on
9-reboot into windows and import master public key so you can check transactions (but you can't spend )
---TO create a transaction---
1-go to watch-only wallet &gt; create unsigned transaction &gt; Save in USB or QR code or Write Down ;
2- boot on offline computer &gt;  load wallet with 12 words seed &gt; Load unsigned transaction trought QR code / file / write down text &gt; Sign &gt; save signed transaction (QR/file/text)
3-broadcast signed transaction by either :
   Loading trought online electrum or online Web Tools by pasting 
    text of signed transaction

earn 35% and buy again when the price **stabilize** ??
that's not an option..
do the exchanges also have a premium on altcoins?

traitor! why dont you go to paypal.com instead?
@_date: 2017-05-12 16:31:55
Open another account and try to see which deposit methods they use, contact all their partners.
Also try to contact support on that account and get them on the phone, you would be able to locste them trough phone number
I also feel very bad for you :(
@_date: 2017-05-26 11:38:50
yes but most Users dont operate Full nodes and would not know what exactly happens , this can cause a market panic
@_date: 2017-05-12 19:32:17
Totally agree, but don't think it would go that far.  I think 1300 is a stable resistance 
@_date: 2017-05-27 05:24:21
that makes sense but sometime the USB connection for current hardware wallets is a bit bothersome and offersa layer for a hack ;
why can't there be wallet completely isolated from other devices that generate QR codes &amp; import QR codes to :
import raw tx as QR code  &amp; sign it &amp; display output as QR
export master public key as QR code
i beleive that's feasible ; i'm thinking of bricking a smartphone and use this !
@_date: 2017-05-27 05:32:38
perhaps convert to another coin -with same price as bfx - in other exchange then transfer to bitfinex and buy more btc and transfer back;
redo until spread is gone
@_date: 2017-05-11 02:07:23
Cubits is secure and low fees, but you'll get ideed like applying for citizenship 
@_date: 2017-05-17 13:40:41
seed may be all what you need ; however
i wonder if -in the meantime of a loss event- you can use that seed in electrum to access your funds ;
@_date: 2017-05-22 08:02:51
each time the crash is postponed -eg segwit excitement - it aquire x2 power and would more violent as ever ;
  
@_date: 2017-06-13 07:44:49
true ! Xapo works great and got reasonable fees;
i also let down coinsbank for that
@_date: 2017-06-29 10:21:31
cubits.com or bitlish.com 
@_date: 2017-06-16 10:28:14
because pricey electricity costs 
@_date: 2017-06-26 15:21:52
compare cubits.com  and bitlish.com ; if your country supports coinbase.com then do it
