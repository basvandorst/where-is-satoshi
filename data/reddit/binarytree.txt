Glad you like it!

We have it ready, but haven't launched it yet. Will be pushing it live shortly.

Big retailers like Amazon still need to receive fiat at this stage. Until we get more adoption, they need fiat in order to do their accounting, pay suppliers, etc. As adoption increases more and more merchants will want to hold Bitcoin. Increasing Bitcoin spending and payments transaction volumes is the first step to having major retailers utilize Bitcoin.

That's a lot of questions. Let me do my best here...


* User installs Moon
* User shops on Amazon like normal
* User goes to Amazon checkout page
* At checkout, user is presented with the option to pay with Bitcoin
* User sends Bitcoin to Moon
* Moon works with payments companies to pay Amazon the needed fiat and completes the user's order on Amazon.com using JS kungfu, a bit of magic and a bunch of APIs. 


They don't care at this stage, but I know I have some fans on the Amazon team. :)


That's between you and Amazon (or USPS?). Refunds are processed as Amazon credit applied to your Amazon account. 


See previous answer.




Yes, Moon will allow you to pay for the remaining balance of the purchase with Bitcoin after you've applied credits, discounts, etc.


No, but he can save 5% on Prime Day without having Prime.


Sales tax is calculated by Amazon, not Moon. We just let you pay it in Bitcoin. 


Moon does not have access to your CC number. 
Hope that helps! :)
@_date: 2019-07-11 23:14:52
We don’t charge users any fees to make purchases through Moon. We collect a small fee when the merchant gets paid.
@_date: 2019-07-05 20:33:52
Not yet, but we're working on it.
@_date: 2019-07-11 18:46:53
Only amazon.com for now, but we will add the other Amazons in the next few months!
@_date: 2019-07-11 23:12:12
That’s a great idea!! Will definitely add smile.amazon.com! prime.amazon.com is almost done. Thank you for your kind words. Please feel free to reach out with any other feedback.
@_date: 2019-07-11 23:13:19
Maybe when we expand to Europe :)
@_date: 2019-07-11 20:29:10
We're primarily looking to hire developers. If you're a developer and in the NYC area, please let us know!
@_date: 2019-07-15 18:27:06
When you make a return you'll get refunded in Amazon credit automatically applied to your Amazon account.
@_date: 2019-07-11 19:18:32
Yes! Please send me a PM with your info.
@_date: 2019-07-12 00:02:27
So what you're saying is that you still have fiat? Do you like even *believe* in Bitcoin?
In all seriousness though, what increases the value of btc long term is its utility as an actual currency. The more usage btc has, the more adoption, the more value it has, the higher the price. Think the long game. Spend and replace.
@_date: 2019-07-12 10:52:57
Currently it’s only amazon.com but we’ll be adding support for the European Amazon sites in the next few months. You can still shop on .com from European countries if they’ll ship to you though.
@_date: 2019-07-11 18:46:32
Not yet. Only amazon.com for now, but we will add it in the next few months!
@_date: 2019-07-12 01:03:48
You are **really** buying from Amazon, so you talk to them for any product, shipping, etc questions. Talk to Mr Moon with any issues with the extension or payment. But I mean, you can always feel free to talk to me if you're lonely and want to be Mr. Moon's friend...
@_date: 2019-07-05 20:32:10
You can shop directly on Amazon.com with [Moon]( using Lightning Network which solves the 0-conf issues mentioned by u/cointastical and makes the transactions effectively instant and with almost no fee (fractions of a penny). There are a lot of new applications using Lightning Network now.
@_date: 2019-07-11 20:36:28
Absolutely! We're working to push it out to as many places as possible. Feel free to spread the word to your friends and maybe it will give them enough incentive to get them into BTC.
@_date: 2019-07-11 19:35:48
Thank you!
@_date: 2019-07-12 00:27:42
First of all, Purse is great and I have a lot of respect for them. They've done some great stuff. 
Moon is different because it lets you shop directly on Amazon.com, which gives you the full benefits of shopping on Amazon, like Amazon Prime deals, shipping, using rewards points to cover part of the purchase, product options, etc. that you may not have on Purse. With Purse you don't have as much control and you don't get the native Amazon.com user experience, which many people know and love. 
Also, we're adding more merchants so that will be a big difference.
@_date: 2019-07-11 17:23:30
Thanks for the shout out! On Amazon Prime Day we're doing 5% off anything you buy on Amazon with Moon. :)
@_date: 2019-07-11 20:31:01
We have it ready, but haven't launched it yet. Will be pushing it live shortly.
@_date: 2018-10-26 17:31:08
We have partnered with financial intermediaries who pay the merchant in fiat on behalf of the user. The experience is completely seamless to the user. Just click “Pay with Moon” and the transaction will be completed immediately. 
@_date: 2019-11-27 18:07:03
Hey u/cooriah! This has nothing to do with any government or regulatory issue and we've never received a gag order, surveillance request or anything from a court. We are integrating with a new partner that we'll be using for payments and have decided to focus all of our efforts on that integration. 
I've considered adding a canary. Probably will in the next website update.
@_date: 2018-10-26 21:40:00
That's great feedback. I want to ensure everything is very transparent as privacy and trust are critical in the crypto community. In Moons user onboarding process we explicitly state what data we collect at every stage in the process. The landing page is a bit more market-y, but we can do a better job of calling out privacy features. 
@_date: 2018-10-26 21:08:11
No worries! Always happy to get any kind of feedback, good or bad.
@_date: 2018-10-27 01:52:15
Thank you! :)
@_date: 2018-10-26 17:11:09
No exchange rate. When shopping with Moon, there are no fees of any kind :)
@_date: 2018-10-26 18:46:34
You should absolutely be skeptical of anyone looking for access to your financial accounts, and gaining the trust of the community is going to be a critical factor in our success. Yes, we do need access to your Coinbase account in order for the extension to facilitate purchases, similar to many financial technology products on the market. How best can I gain your trust? 
Also, hi, I'm Ken: 
@_date: 2018-10-27 05:05:43
I'm not using any bots to promote this. That would be a bit extreme to get some beta testers and feedback from the community, but I understand your skepticism. There are a lot of scams in the crypto space.
@_date: 2018-10-26 21:19:26
That is correct. Moon is not anonymous in order to comply with KYC/AML as well as other laws.
@_date: 2018-10-26 18:22:33
Good question! We don't charge fees to users, but we do receive fees from the financial intermediaries with which we partner to facilitate the payments to the merchant.
@_date: 2018-10-26 18:24:39
For this beta we require that users be based in the US, but in the future we will absolutely be supporting other countries. 
@_date: 2018-10-26 17:27:18
We are in the process of adding support for other wallets, but the beta will only support Coinbase for now. Sign up for the beta regardless and I’ll make sure to contact you when we support other wallets. 
Also...why did Coinbase ban your account?
@_date: 2018-10-26 21:07:00
That's what we are starting with but will be adding other options in the future. What would you like to see?
@_date: 2018-10-26 18:28:25
I should be more clear: *Users* do not pay any fees. The financial intermediaries actually pay us a fee for every transaction we process with them.
Thanks for your kind words :)
@_date: 2018-10-27 18:50:46
We just started with Coinbase. We will be adding other integrations in the future.
@_date: 2018-10-26 16:42:22
Thanks! I appreciate it!
@_date: 2015-07-01 21:14:24
Sarcasm is lost on you
@_date: 2015-07-11 21:16:49
I think that is what SMBC was going for. I prefer u/hellobitcoinworld's interpretation.
@_date: 2019-04-30 14:50:02
Hi! Creator of Moon here. If you make a return, you will get credit on your Amazon account. Coinbase is aware that you use Moon, but they do not have any access to your purchase data or any other data you provide to Moon.
@_date: 2019-04-30 16:39:55
On the checkout screen you should see [this](
You should have the option to pay with Lightning Network in the "Payment Method" dropdown menu in Moon.
@_date: 2019-04-30 15:01:53
I think you're probably looking at a product page. When on a product page, Moon just gives you pricing and balance information. Add a product to your cart and go to the Amazon checkout process. When in checkout, Moon gives you the option to pay with Lightning Network. 
We've had similar feedback where users see the Coinbase button and think it's a requirement. We're going to change the UI to make this more clear.
@_date: 2019-04-30 15:02:12
You are correct!
@_date: 2019-04-30 14:50:48
Hi! Creator of Moon here. You do not need to connect your Coinbase account in order to use Moon with Lightning Network. :)
@_date: 2019-01-22 17:10:31
We're in the process of adding functionality to allow users to pay from any wallet. Are there any particular wallets or integrations you would like to see us support? 
Also, for the sake of my learning, are you bummed out by the Coinbase requirement because you don't have a Coinbase account? Is it because Coinbase does not operate in your jurisdiction? Or is it because you dislike Coinbase? Any details you provide would be helpful as we continue to build our our product roadmap. Thank you!
@_date: 2019-01-22 23:03:27
Great questions!
1. We're looking to roll out support for other wallets in the next few months. We need to weigh the demand for new new wallets vs the demand for new merchants, but it looks like the overwhelming demand is for supporting new wallets.
2. The conversion price is the market rate at the moment of purchase.
3. We don't charge fees to users. We collect a small fee from our partners that help us facilitate payments to merchants. 
@_date: 2019-01-23 02:50:56
There are plenty of reasons folks may not like Coinbase. There are millions of people who use and enjoy Coinbase too and have reasons for doing so. Understanding these user segments is an important part of delivering value to users. The reasons you dislike Coinbase may not be the same as others. 
Thanks for your feedback!
@_date: 2019-05-16 02:58:42
You figured out our master plan!
@_date: 2019-05-16 02:56:24
Unfortunately Amazon does not accept bitcoin yet, so its converted into dollars before Amazon will touch it. This is the next step towards adoption and will hopefully lead to them wanting to accept bitcoin in the future.
@_date: 2019-05-16 21:05:17
My pleasure!
@_date: 2019-05-19 15:21:14
You are correct! Only amazon.com for now. Working on the others.
@_date: 2019-05-17 04:43:58
Stay tuned. ;)
@_date: 2019-05-16 16:13:24
We’re working on it! :)
@_date: 2019-05-16 02:45:30
Creator of Moon here. Yes, we will provide you a record of your transactions to help with any tax calculations. It's not built into the UI yet. We eat the fees associated with transferring funds. The user still has to pay Lightning Network fees, which are typically only a few satoshi. We also set the fees on our LN node to the lowest allowed by the network. We don't charge the user any fees on top of that. I don't think it makes sense to pay a fee to spend your own money. 
Shameless plug: [paywithmoon.com](

If you return an item on Amazon you’ll receive Amazon credit applied to your Amazon account.
@_date: 2019-05-16 16:13:38
Not yet, but soon.
@_date: 2019-05-01 04:56:03
We work with intermediaries to facilitate payments to merchants. In exchange for this transaction volume they pay us fees and commissions. No fees for users. :)
@_date: 2019-05-16 03:03:23
If you return a product you purchased on Amazon you will receive Amazon credit automatically applied to your Amazon account.
@_date: 2019-05-17 04:43:07
There are features we are integrating into Moon that will require an account. Yes, you do need to be logged in to Moon in order to use Moon. We do not sell your data and the IRS would need to subpoena anything for us to disclose that information. I've been thinking of adding a warrant canary for that exact circumstance.
@_date: 2019-05-15 19:20:00
If you make a return you will receive Amazon credit applied to your Amazon account.
@_date: 2019-05-15 19:18:01
Logging into Coinbase is not required if you pay with Lightning Network.
@_date: 2019-05-15 19:17:32
Moon facilitates the payment on *your* account. Items are not ordered through a 3rd party account.
@_date: 2019-05-16 02:51:04
Amazon is only the first merchant we support. Others are coming. We are implementing features that will necessitate that a user have an account. 
We do not share any user data with Coinbase and the IRS will have to subpoena us to get any user data. I was actually thinking of implementing a warrant canary on our site for that specific scenario.
@_date: 2013-11-29 21:34:44
The issue is that merchants are pinning the value of their products to USD and not BTC. As the exchange rate fluctuates, so does the price of the product in BTC. The goal is that merchants value their products in BTC. So, a gallon of milk would cost .004 BTC, not "whatever bitcoin amount will give me $4".
The hope is also that people will buy BTC in advance to hold on to and use as currency, not to exchange USD for BTC the moment they want to buy something. If you purchased some BTC a few months ago, you would have made 1000% return on investment and effectively made all of your purchases 1/10th the price. If you purchase BTC now, maybe in a few months it will go up in value even more. You can then purchase things with your BTC instead of withdrawing funds to USD.
@_date: 2019-05-16 02:57:00
I tried to make it as dumb as possible!
@_date: 2013-10-21 16:11:40
Besides Coinbase, what exchanges are good for USD/Bitcoin conversion quickly?
@_date: 2013-10-05 21:45:53
What a bunch of 80085
