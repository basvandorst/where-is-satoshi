We are not quite there for machine transactions, but I think OpenBazaar looks quite promissing. 
Let me use an analogy: In the 1920 there was the telephone and manual switchboards. The middleman (or mostly woman in this case) were the people who connected calls. It was a very thriving and profitable. But than technology kicked in and removed that friction. Going forward 90-100 years, last week Alibaba went public and they are just the same kind of business, they are connecting calls (it is just a different appearance). I don't see any reason why technology should not make services like Alibaba obsolete. 
I see your point in bringing something entirely new and exciting to the human race, but I think Bitcoin will be successful if you remove friction in the existing system. And this could also be very boring on the surface, because the enduser won't see much change.

As a physicist this was fun to read. But this is more or less just playing around. He is using thermodynamics to characterize the behavior of Bitcoin. But here is the kicker, particles in a box can move freely, but if you put pressure on one side of the box and change the boundary conditions they act respectively. So, can we predict the boundary conditions of Bitcoin? No, that is pure politics. Even if you have a model that predicts Bitcoin in the past and today, it is almost completly worthless if the Fed would allow Bitcoin or not. 
**TL;DR:** Statistical physics models are super awesome and can predict events if the boundary conditions are stationary, and that is clearly not the case in the current Bitcoin environment.

While your observation are true, you misses another great point. The distribution are uniform and with a mean at arround 0%, that means, if you increase the number of transaction, chances are your gains and losses are even out. But that also means, if you have a buissnes with a low transaction number, you have to make arrangements. But if you can generate a big number of transactions and compare it with a creditcardpaymentsystem with an fixed rate of 3% per transaction, you just have to hold 1% of your transaction amount as a buffer, maybe another 1% (or a fixed amount of coins/cash based on your average sales a day) and as a result you can make 1% more profit just by switching to bitcoin as paymentsystem. Again this is a numbergame and the events you characterize can really hurt any buissnes, if you are not prepared.

Bitcoin as a medium of exchange will have a likewise impact as the shipping container. In the 1950 it took a lot of time to get the mixed cargo on and off the ship. A lot of people were working in the haven, some got very rich, but not because their work were so valubale, but because they owned the right spot on the pier. The shipping container standardised cargo, you could pack your cargo anywere. And international trading exploded. Bitcoin standardise banking and it will boost trading and services in the same way.

A stable currency is always more desirable, however the question is: Does it work for a country?
For example look at Argintine Peso  see the drop in Jan 2014 the argentine central bank acually pumped $1.25 billion in the market to compensate this drop.  After that they were selling arround $100 million daily. This is a desission every central bank must make, but just imagine this money were not sold on the forex market but were invested in the local economy. An unstable exchange rate is just a symptom to the underlying political problem, an artifical stable exchange rate cannot fix this. It just takes off the edge and cost money. Also I have not read a single paper which describes exactly how to control inflation/deflation within a sigma 3 certainty. If we knew exactly what to do and how to control the moneysupply, all western countries would have an inflation of (2.0000000 +/- 0.269 9796)%. What central bank do is just make an educated guess. I'm not saying they are stupid, but we as a human race just don't know a better way. 
But back to a stable currency, bitcoin is quite stable, if you use it in the right way. You need to wait 6 blocks to finish a transaction. I just could find 30 min volatility charts  but it will do. This chart has three very important properties: it is normally distributed, more or less uniform and the mean is at arround 0%. Which means, if you have a high amount of transactions, you end up with no loss or gain and this is a fantastic property for a currency exchange protocol.
And the point global currency: I don't think Bitcoin is a global currency, but is a just a tool for converting local currencies.

Somehow this paper misses the point of bitcoin. 
Page 17: The author treats bitcoin like a currency, but bitcoin is a currency exchange protocoll. To get Bitcoin to work the price indeed needs stability, but only for 6 blocks. That means Bitcoin needs 60 min with a low volatility (like 1%-2%). 
I find it interesting that every paper from a banking perpsective fail to mention this near realtime exchange. Maybe it is due the fact that banks have access to realtime or high frequency trading. But the rest of the world doesn't! If I transfer money to another country it takes minimum 2 days. A high daily volatility puts me or the bank in the danger of currency rate fluctuation, but a bankingsystem in Bitcoinworld just needs 6 blocks. I mean, 1 Bitcoin gives me the right to modify 1*10^8 databaseentries in the blockchain. The value of that right is negotiable between the parties. And nobody forbids banks to build a "web of trust" and agree that they can use Bitcoin among themselves with thier publicly known Bitcoin adresses with a fixed exchangerate of 1 Satoschi = $ 1.

He is probably right from a bankers perspective. There are a ton of rules for banks for two reasons. To prevent cheating between banks (lets face it most people will cheat and lie if they have the chance) and second not getting others out of the game by setting the entrylevel as high as possible. In the long run this is even better for the consumer. However this guy and probably all others misses the important point that bitcoin is already heavily regulated. The regulation is in the code. If you want to be part of the network, you have to play by the rules. I can't cheat, I can't counterfit, I can't make up Bitcoin transactions and I can't scam my business partner. All from a Bitcoin view, I still can set up a business collect Bitcoin and don't deliver the goods. But this is not cheating in the Bitcoin network. This is a matter of private law and not banking regulation. So this is one of the urban myth that bitcoin is unregulated. What is unregulated are the exchanges and this needs to be adressed.

ATM ... don't get your hopes up. What is the biggest yuan note? Wikipedia says 100 yuan. The price of one Bitcoin is ~2800 yuan, But lets say for the sake of argument it is 2500 yuan. So just buying 1 Bitcoin you need 250 notes. If 10 notes are the hight of 1 mm, that is a pile of 2.5 cm money. Also just imagine you want to put 250 yuan in the ATM and it takes 5 sec to get it in (feeding, checking and accounting) 250 * 5 sec = 1250 sec =&gt; 20.83 min. So you are just standing 20 min in front of the ATM just to buy 1 Bitcoin.

Or if you produce food in your garden and eat it, you are absolutly worthless in GPD terms, but producing food that you can it it not worthless in my opinion. 
The problem I have, I can't point to a better system. I don't know how to quantify work that is not paid for but is good for society can be measured. But then I think, do we need to measure everything, each time you use a system to quantify a process the measure becomes more important than the underlying values. So even if we would find a way to measure unpaid important work, it will become meaningless in a couple of years.

I can certainly see the point, why a majority of people want a inflation of 2%. But saying deflation will cause people and companies to stop buy anything is just plain stupid. With that logic nobody would own a computer. Why buy a computer today if you get twice the power if you buy 18 month from now. What really hurts the economy are uncertainties. If you know in 18 month everything will double you can find the price you are willing to pay for a product and still get a profit out of it. In any regime (inflation or deflation) you can run a profitable company, the change of regimes are the uncertainties that can choke business and that's why everybody is freaked out.

While your statement is pretty much true, did you read the paper? The finding is pretty interesting, they boild it down to one interesting market feature to look out for: \frac{\sigma_d}{\sqrt(V_d)} 
Where \sigma_d is the ratio of volatility and \sqrt(V_d) the square root of the traded volume. That cannot predict the market, but could lead to better risk revard trading. If this ratio changes you have to be more careful. Of course, finding with hindsight a anomaly in a fixed dataset is completly different then making a decision in a live environment with your money on the table.

What this article fails to mention is that the LTRO program of the ECB is about to end. LTRO was a 1 trillion credit to the banks with a runtime of 3 years  
The banks payed back the money and by paying back a credit they pretty much reduced the moneysupply by that amount in the system. So the QE tries to correct that. If you are in the mindset of a central bank it does makes sense.

There are serveral kinds of derivatives. That they are trading nothing at all is not true, someone who issue a derivative will at some point buy the asset as insurance or to deliver what the contract in the derivative says. In fact the price of Bitcoin is a derivative on the usefulness on the databaseentries in the Blockchain. So Bitcoin itself is a derivative. However your criticism targets a valid point, that a derivative if handeled like an asset can lead to a total loss.

I never said that Bush lied, I said that goverment officials lied. For some reason you mentioned Bush.
And he is citing some CIA memos, well they should have made them public before making the case for going to war. 


He "recall" that is newspeak for: that is our truth. 


some minor folks who are anti-american ... well Jimmy Carter wrote an op-ed in the NY Times  
Just remember he lead an commission that only got the information from the CIA et al that THEY wanted to give them. The NSA/CIA caught lying for the past 10 years multiple times, I don't know why anyone should trust a word they are saying. Clapper lied infront of the congress and nobody seems to care. It is not the single lie, but it is an expression what these people think from the country. They don't give a shit about the rules.
The US goverment at this time did not make a clear case why they want to go to war.

At the time Fischer was German foreign minister and he was briefed by the BND, they knew it was a lie. He told publicly to Rumsfeld that he is not convinced about the WMD.  that video was from the Munich Security Conference 2003 
So, please stick to the facts. And do not call me an idiot, I didn't insult you and there is nothing wrong with respecting each other.

the operator of BTC-24 triggered moneylaundering alarms by extracting larger amounts of cash from a german bank. Some clients transfered funds to the polish bank and did not get credit in thier BTC-24 account. 
&lt;speculation mode&gt;
operator gets tagged as evil druglord by getting cash out of a bank account. banks shut all down, hold back money so a possible criminal can not use it. they inform the police, at the same time money from BTC-24 customers don't get through and blame it on the operator which is clueless at this point. the customers file a report at the police and a week later they shut it down. 
&lt;/speculation mode&gt;

I read it as a confession that they can't effectively regulate or control local banks. So they forbid them to participate and allow exchanges which are quite new, a very small number and can't grant loans to persons or businesses. This circumvent that credit or a large amount of dirty money flows into the system. However that creats a risk that the exchanges could be closed without effort. But if they wanted that, this statement would have been the right place for this announcement.
