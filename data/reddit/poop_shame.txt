Let's check back in a couple hours. 
@_date: 2019-03-17 00:34:11
Bitcoin enthusiasts are some weird people. 
@_date: 2019-03-08 22:03:47
You were saying?
@_date: 2019-03-16 05:05:49
Omg wow, what a bullrun. There is not a chance there is another dump on the horizon. I was wrong about these magic internet fun bux all along.  
@_date: 2019-03-09 03:17:01
I'm no chart expert or anything but it looks like it hasn't moved in the last two hours. gg

Have you considered just paying your taxes?
@_date: 2019-03-02 00:49:37
You've "been in contact"? Just curious, have the "contacted you back" yet?
@_date: 2019-03-04 20:45:40
Hilarious. 
@_date: 2019-03-04 03:35:59
What a dumb system. You have your employer send your salary to a third party to buy bitcoins on your behalf for a fee... then what? You pay another company to convert your bitcoins back to fiat when you spend them? Wouldn't just spending fiat be a whole lot more simple for everyone involved?
@_date: 2019-03-21 14:59:52
I love how excited everyone gets when the price goes up $100 only to have it come crash right back down. ��
@_date: 2019-03-01 15:55:03
Buy if you have the prospect for immense gains you're not going to spend it, only hold. This makes it a bad currency. 
@_date: 2019-03-12 17:54:44
A couple weeks? You said a couple hours the other day. 
@_date: 2019-03-19 18:22:02


Are you talking about QuadringaCX?
@_date: 2019-03-18 20:25:14
You should ask the people that post daily about the impending bull run. 
@_date: 2019-03-03 23:24:17
Hey boss, can you go through the convoluted process of converting my wages from fiat to btc to pay me? No? Ok thanks anyway. 
@_date: 2019-03-25 02:27:34
Plenty of cryptos have lower fees. 
@_date: 2019-03-01 03:20:50
Wow, you're so close. Now replace fb coin with crypto in general. 
@_date: 2019-03-19 18:23:57


I don't believe you.

@_date: 2019-03-11 22:45:20
No one cares about Bitcoin. Mass adoption is not happening. 
@_date: 2019-03-23 03:49:35
Are we still in a bullrun?
@_date: 2019-03-19 15:56:34
What happened to the big breakout you predicted to happen overnight?
@_date: 2019-03-12 16:01:38

Nothing to worry about, it will never hit 25k. 
@_date: 2019-03-25 00:31:03
Yes, for far too long the masses have struggled to send a half million dollars to the other side of the globe. Now it's quick and easy. Just make sure you don't screw up the address or your money is gone forever.

@_date: 2019-02-02 22:01:28


I need to go update my CV then. 
@_date: 2019-02-12 04:42:58
How long will it take for you to give up on Bitcoin? Hypothetically let's say some time from now price is still flat, adoption has gone nowhere , projects come and go with no effect, and nothing but continued false hope on the horizon? How long before you throw in the towel? A year? 5? 10?
@_date: 2019-02-14 01:51:05
Don't forget to calculate your capital gains before you eat. 
@_date: 2019-02-03 16:54:03

@_date: 2019-02-07 01:27:51

What advantage does crypto offer vs fiat in real estate? Genuinely curious. 
@_date: 2019-02-02 04:54:51
One word, utility. 
@_date: 2019-04-30 20:42:57
Does this not prove that the price of bitcoin and crypto in general is being artificially inflated by tether though?
@_date: 2019-02-07 01:37:55

How will mass adoption take place after the banks collapse? What are they going to buy Bitcoin with if fiat is worthless?
@_date: 2019-04-24 20:17:29
Rally is stalling, shitcoin money will flow back out of bitcoin now.
@_date: 2019-04-03 08:15:58

@_date: 2019-04-30 21:55:00
Definitely not? I don't understand your logic. Explain how using pretend money to buy Bitcoin wouldn't artificially inflate the price..

@_date: 2019-04-16 21:33:00

@_date: 2019-04-08 20:08:24
Just remember: 
price down=manipulation
price up=orgnaic growth/mass adoption.

His ass.
@_date: 2019-04-05 08:19:03
I didn't say bitcoin shouldn't have value, but to try and say Bitcoin should have parity with BRK.A is absurd. 
@_date: 2019-04-05 07:10:04
Buying BRK.A is buying small parts of established profitable companies. Buying Bitcoin it buying a bunch of letters and numbers that you hope to be able to sell to someone else for more than you paid. 
@_date: 2019-04-28 07:41:06
Bitcoin is better because we'll all get rich and buy lambos and never have to work again.

@_date: 2019-01-24 16:42:51
When is Russia going to buy their 10 billion dollars worth of Bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-01-22 20:20:37
And then everyone in the restaurant clapped. 
@_date: 2019-01-18 02:17:36
Anyone still think they're going to get rich off Bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-01-26 17:23:08
Also you get to calculate capital gains every time you buy a coffee, truly the future of currency. 
@_date: 2019-01-17 22:25:00
You'll die too. 
@_date: 2019-01-28 16:19:17
That's just how the currency of the future be sometimes. 
@_date: 2019-01-16 22:19:57
But with crypto, the game never changes. 
@_date: 2019-01-05 07:13:29

Yeah, and this sub now has over a million subscribers. Useless metric. 
@_date: 2019-01-10 17:07:01

Yes, but fortunately, my feelings regenerate at twice the speed of a normal man's.
@_date: 2019-01-29 15:57:15
That's the question they can never answer. What incentive would the average person have to go through the extra step of converting their fiat to Bitcoin when they can just spend their fiat with less hassle.

@_date: 2019-01-24 02:12:12

@_date: 2019-01-04 03:35:40
Because everyone is just holding their Bitcoin hoping it moons so they can sell. Almost no one is interested in actually using it. 
@_date: 2019-01-06 17:43:16
Institutional money is here. 
@_date: 2019-01-17 01:11:02
So basically Bitcoin would do nothing to address the issue in OPs article. 
@_date: 2019-01-08 19:22:23
A crazy homeless person shouted it at me while I was on my way to work at the bank.

@_date: 2019-01-10 17:15:52

@_date: 2019-01-15 13:36:39
If fiat is worthless and Bitcoin is the future, shouldn't everyone be cheering for the price to go down? I mean wouldn't we want to accumulate as much as possible before mass adoption takes place?
@_date: 2019-01-30 07:15:35
I bought three bitcoins and I want to put them in my computer. Which slot do I need to put them into to download them onto my hard drive?

Imagine supporting a hostile foreign nation in the hopes that it will make you a few thousand dollars. 
@_date: 2019-01-01 07:28:20
You would have to have just a nonsensical amount of USD in circulation for this to happen. One hundred million USD per Bitcoin? The dollar would cease to be a currency before this would happen. 
@_date: 2019-01-15 06:34:09
Sideways is good too. You can accumulate at a lower price point before it moons. The only movement you should hate is when it goes up. 
@_date: 2019-01-15 06:23:28

If by the same time you mean never... then yes I think you're right.

Don't feel sorry for us, I'm enjoying the ride. I know you'll be too dumb to cash out before it inevitably crashes again anyway.

So wash trading?

Show of hands, who was smart enough to sell at the top?
@_date: 2019-05-04 22:47:30
I was wrong, please accept my deepest apologies. If you suffererd any losses don't fret. I'm launching an ICO soon and will reimburse anyone who submits a proof of loss in Poopcoin.
@_date: 2019-05-11 23:26:35
You said that already, still don't care.
@_date: 2019-05-01 19:14:43
Using your employers electricity for personal financial gain? I see no scenario in which this turns out bad for you. Do it!
@_date: 2019-05-04 18:12:46
5k by the end of the week.
@_date: 2019-05-11 19:05:51
So it won't continue to rise?
@_date: 2019-05-11 21:51:36
Countertheory: Bitfinex is throwing everything they have at generating a new pump to attract whatever $USD influx they can get from FOMO'ing butters because they are otherwise completely cash insolvent.
@_date: 2019-05-03 23:32:50
In this moment I am euphoric....
@_date: 2019-05-26 01:04:43
Repeat ad nauseum
@_date: 2019-05-29 16:23:45
Bitcoin -.21% in the last three hours.
@_date: 2019-05-28 03:05:48
Don't forget... short every rally.

@_date: 2018-12-24 16:08:41
Because it's going downhill. 
@_date: 2019-05-30 22:40:18
The vegeta memes at the top of the front page did not age well.

Everyone here is just in it for the tech.

If only they had a unique string on letters and numbers written down.  Then there would be enough food for everyone.

They deride FUD but post delusional optimism to try and reassure others so they keep dumping their life savings into the ponzi.
@_date: 2019-05-08 05:52:41
I can't wait until the hackers dump their coins.
@_date: 2018-12-24 03:43:40
Desperate attempt to reduce supply to raise the price.

Prediction for 2019: whales continue to manipulate the price while the general public continues to not give a shit about Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2019-05-25 17:14:55
Why are bitcoiners so weird?

Using it as a currency won't establish it as a currency?

1. Bitfinex prints tether to pump bitcoin
2. People FOMO in thinking it's a new bullrun
3. Bitfinex empties their bags and takes your USD
@_date: 2019-05-24 23:50:52
Well he actually made money, so maybe he's the smartest guy in the room.

Reeeeeee, why no Anderson shill for my mah Bitcoins?
@_date: 2019-05-14 19:20:32
Put all of your holdings in tether, what could go wrong?
@_date: 2019-05-16 16:24:52
Looks like Bitfinex pumped the price higher than the market will bear. Can't hang on to 8k.
@_date: 2018-12-26 20:59:55
Killing whales to stick it to the libs.
@_date: 2019-05-30 04:38:57
Why even ask? According to everyone here it's going up.
@_date: 2019-05-22 01:50:47
If the US government wanted to kneecap Bitcoin, this is the route you think they'd take?
@_date: 2019-05-17 21:14:55
$250,000,000 in long positions were liquidated in the flash crash last night. Who would have both the ability and motive to trigger such a move?
@_date: 2019-05-17 22:37:37
Whale Steve doesn't make money off of liquidations. Whale Steve would empty his bags slowly.
@_date: 2019-05-17 16:51:30
Oh boy bitcoin still down, bullish AF
