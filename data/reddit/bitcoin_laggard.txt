Do not use cryptocurrency wallet in a Windows machine. To quote Andreas, it's like making a donation to hackers. You * will * get hacked under Windows.
I have cold storage in Tails + Electrum and never had a problem. I'm positive you are making some mistake in the process. 
If you are planning to use tails for cold storage, I can paste a guide I wrote a while ago.
Or you can view it directly on my profile, I have only opened 2 topics here and 1 of them is about setting up a tails system for cold storage.
Happy 2018 hodling

I´ve asked myself this very same question yesterday night. 
And the answer was:
"I woulnd´t give a shit. Also, I wish I had more fiat available to get some more at a discount"

OP should update topic title to state Andreas has an unpaid position on that.  
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:51:37
Thank you Andreas. You are truly enlightened. A passionate educator. I admire that.

Creating an online account on some startup app and tell them all about my crypto investments?
Sorry, but no. 
I programmed a Libre Office Spreadsheet with all calculations I felt I needed to have (took me 30 minutes). The file is saved with encryption. 
Every day I open it, update the BTC value and it gives me all info I need.

OP, are you using Windows to operate in crypto?
If so, "My sincere condolences". "It's like making a donation to hackers". (A. Antonopolous).
Or, if losing the amount of Bicoin you have would make you cry (and if you can't use Linux/iOs) you should get a hardware wallet.

I am absolutely astonished with such demonstration of generosity. I hope this good soul that made Andreas officialy a bitcoin millionaire achieves the highest level of peace, happiness and health for the rest of his/hers life. 
I wish the same to all of you that donated even the smallest amount, because your hearts are just as full of love as his/hers.

If you dont want to go hardware wallet, I think this is the best option:
- create 2 live Tails USBs with encrypted persistent storage, strictly following instructions on their website. Password for encrypted persistent storage should be at least 60 bits of entropy (I used Rumkin´s password tester - 
- one live tails USB is your air-gapped system. 
Never plug it to a online computer, only boot with cables detached / wireless phisically set off). 
Use a pencil marker or different models of sticks so you will always remember that USB *should never touch a computer plugged/wirelless conected to the internet*.
 There,  you create an offline electrum wallet for your cold storage. 
Write down seed. Set a password with at least 60bits of entropy. 
Write down password. Store two copies of the paper seed and paper password in two different and safe places. 
Save the offline wallet PUBLIC keys (let me repeat: PUBLIC keys) in a text file.
- the other live Tails USB is your online system and can be booted with the internet cable plugged. 
Create a watch only wallet, using cold wallet public keys. From there you can monitor your coins.
In case you need to move funds from cold storage:
- Use the online Tails to create unsigned transactions, save them in the persistent storage.
- Detach internet cable/turn off wireless.
- Boot the Air-Gapped Tails, sign transaction with the cold wallet, save the signed transaction to persistent storage. 
- Boot the online Tails USB, broadcast the transaction. 
- Remember to turn off your computer and wait 10 seconds before each boot. 
For small amounts (mBTCs) for purchasing things, you should create  a Mycelium "hot" wallet on an Android or IOS phone. 
Remember to write down seed and PIN and store two copies on two different and safe locations
Last, but not least, you should only acess your Exchange of choice using the Tails Online USB, or with a Ubuntu Live USB (some exchanges dont work with TOR connections).
Also, unless you are day trading, you should not leave any amounts of fiat or Bitcoin in the exchange. Deposit the fiat, buy the BTC and move them to your cold storage wallet within 15 minutes (to quote Andreas, "15 minutes, in and out!")
Its not a safe practice to use Windows for anything related to Bitcoin or any cryptocurrency.
These basic guidelines should keep you safe from most threats.

This is a must see for anyone really interested in Bitcoin and crypto world. 
To be honest I think  its the only video on the internet  where you have a meeting of people of such high caliber, giving speeches about the mission of Bitcoin and its political aspects, the technical aspects, crypto estate planning,  security devices, lightning network and 2nd layer, and so on. 
Im taking the time to listen fully to all speeches and Im stoked about being able to be part of the event. 
You should do the same.

I wouldn´t buy because all the fiat Im able to invest in bitcoin is already invested. I´d have to wait the next paycheck. 
Thats why Im an all time high buyer.

I'm sorry, man.

As usual, I always buy high. Made my monthly purchase this afternoon lol.
But the hodl is strong with me.
@_date: 2017-11-30 03:25:08
Sorry, but no. It works just fine. 
- Create one Tails Usb stick for offline usage only. Create wallet. Export master public key to a file
- create  a second tails usb stick for online usage. Use the master public key to create a watch only wallet.
- at the online system, create a transaction. Save to usb. 
- boot the offline Tails and start Electrum in --offline mode. Load the transaction. Sign it. Save to usb.
- boot online tails, open Electrum, load signed transaction, broadcast.
It's my current cold storage of choice and yes I moved coins outta there like described above.

I always check your website to have a good time. I love how you play with the rotating phrases and the background also. Took screenshots from Vegeta. And today we got this cool Bitcoin astronaut rocketing to the moon!
Awesome job man!

Trezor is not the weak link here.
The user is.
Not PIN protecting the hardware wallet is a * major * issue. 
Someone had physical access to your device and moved the coins. It's that simple. 
Accept it and learn from your mistake.

Never heard of this website. They try to make the basic cold storage recipe look like rocket science and, at the end, offer to sell you all the hardware for the setup? 
Fuckin LOL, tell me about "trust no one". 
That site has all the red flags for a scam. 
Wanna do air gapped cold storage? Make yourself 2 TAILS live USB's and follow Electrum's cold storage tutorial ( which, by the way, seems to be the one they ripped off)

Well I'm pretty new to this, but eager to find and learn the best sources of information. 
Getting a hardware wallet like Trezor or Ledger is my next step, as I plan to continue acquiring bitcoin.
I dont have much money and the small amount of bitcoin I got already represents a lot to me. 
If I'm getting more than that, I have to really keep minimizing the risk of loss
@_date: 2017-10-20 14:03:00
Yeah... I suppose I'm trying to re-invent the wheel. It seems seeds and passwords backups are not meant to ever come in contact with the digital online world. 
All good sources I read said: "pencil on paper, store it safely in different locations, tamper, fire and water protected. 
@_date: 2017-10-20 03:05:35


My plan was to boot a Ubuntu or Tails live USB and type the things using a physical keyboard onto a LibreOffice text file in a format also compatible with MS Word.
