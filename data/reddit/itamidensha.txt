I've got a question about Electrum/Trezor/BIP38? seeds.
I know that done right, this is a very secure way to store Bitcoin.
Hypothetically, if some computer were grinding away trying 12 word combinations, how many of the deterministic addresses would it generate to check each seed for funds? Could you consider it an extra layer of security to never ever use the first n addresses generated from your seed? 
This way they'd never be used on the network and surely it would look like nobody had ever generated the seed.

THANK YOU.
The whole subreddit is blowing up over this bullshit and it's not even news yet.
Just some irresponsible sensational journalism.
@_date: 2014-01-27 14:53:05
yeah it came through, on about the 7th I think.
You're withdrawing JPY to a domestic account?
@_date: 2014-03-02 03:55:17
What date does it appear they've rolled back to?
I bought BTC on 15 Feb but I can't check if it's been rolled back since I can't get an API key to point the android app to.
What's the earliest date anyone has on a trade that's been rolled back?

I was surprised in the same way. I guess he was just incredibly nervous at the press meeting.
FWIW I listened to the whole thing as well and I concur with MightySpoon's summary. My Japanese is not that fantastic but it wasn't too hard to follow after looking up a few words.
There is a whole lot of chit chat in between that might be interesting to people. PM me if you want a hand translating . I could do the 2nd half and we could crosscheck or something. It's a pretty big chunk of work for 1 person.

They're not talking about rehabilitating. They want to buy gox's assets (~200k BTC &amp; KYC/AML compliant userbase) in exchange for giving the creditors 49% of the new venture. I doubt they'll use the gox name.
I'm a gox creditor, and this sounds potentially good to me. 
If it gets liquidated by the lawyer-vultures, I doubt I'll even see 5% of my balance.
@_date: 2014-02-19 01:27:05
yep, everything worked as described. You gotta verify ID before you can withdraw though, verification took &lt;24 hours for me

I used it. Works.

Look at that ridiculous list of bullshit they asked for. Paypal has become more trouble than it's worth.
I know which system feels more stable to me.

JPY withdrawals are not going within 5-7 days. I'm still waiting for once from the 27th of January. Previously (Oct/Nov last year) they had been going through in 1 business day.
@_date: 2014-02-05 05:26:35
I've been waiting for two JPY withdrawals from around that time as well. Supposedly they have about a 3 week backlog because of the New Years' period.
Sounds like bullshit to me. If I get this cash out, I won't be dealing with them again.

I've been waiting for a JPY withdrawal since the 27th. Gox is incredibly convenient for me while living in Japan, but once this JPY comes through I think I'm done with them. Too much strange shit happening with no explanation, and they NEVER even acknowlege support tickets within about 3 weeks. Not good enough.
@_date: 2014-03-06 14:05:09
This should be at the top.
I'll believe it when I see a digital signature.
@_date: 2014-03-07 01:00:06
As am I. Everyone is losing their shit already and we haven't even verified that the guy CLAIMS to be the creator of bitcoin, let alone seen a signed message to prove it.
What the fuck happened to healthy skepticism?

I'm in the same boat, wish I'd left off the tiny USD balance

Having a copy of your own key won't do you any good if the coins have been moved from your address.
If your house has been robbed of its contents (coins), still having your front door key doesn't help you much.
@_date: 2013-10-11 17:08:43
why not just type your private key into a plain text file, and then encrypt that?
alternatively, move your BTC into one of the addresses generated from your electrum seed, memorise/secure/encrypt the passphrase, and then delete everything.
Electrum can't regenerate an imported key for you, since that key wasn't determined from the seed.
@_date: 2013-10-14 13:39:45
no worries dude!
cool, my first tip!
@_date: 2013-10-11 17:14:10
to be clear - there's no point importing a private key to electrum because it can't be restored from the seed. Send your BTC to one of the electrum generated addresses, since those private keys can be regenerated from the seed.

Don't know about doing it directly, but I've been withdrawing yen to my local bank acc. (I'm in Japan), then sending it to my Australian account using skrill. Total fees are ~$15 per transfer (made up of bank transfer fees in Japan and a flat skrill fee) and the AUD/JPY rate I get is within around 2-3% of the mid market rates at the time of transfer. Chances are you don't have a Japanese bank account, so PM me if you're interested and we can maybe work something out.
EDIT: I had meant to add, this method takes 4-5 business days from end to end, GOX&gt;Japanese Bank&gt;Skrill&gt;Commonwealth Bank.

For some reason the top comment in these threads is always a blanket "you will never ROI"
I bought an antminer S1 three weeks ago, and you'd better believe I did my research. I paid 4.75 BTC and was also told "you will never ROI".
It's a simple calculation, with some assumptions (future difficulty) that you need to be conservative and honest with yourself about.
 I've got 2.5 BTC back so far, expect to ROI in mid January then hopefully profit 1 - 1.5 BTC before the difficulty goes spastic in March, at which time I'll have to re-evaluate.
pre-orders are of course a much bigger gamble of course.
