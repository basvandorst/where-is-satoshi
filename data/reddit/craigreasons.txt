Subway used to have $5 footlongs and Little Caesars had a $5 pizza like a year ago. Now both are $6. That's a 20% drop in a year!!

Yeah exactly, what's happening now is one of Bitcoin's biggest strengths, it's ability to fork when needed. Bitcoin is not like old money, it is a living ever-changing thing that will continue transform for (hopefully) centuries to come. I can envision there being 1,000's of forks in Bitcoin in a hundred years. If every fork has some value, one original bitcoin (pre-Aug 1st) could potentially be worth 100x the value of a single bitcoin mined on the "consensus" chain. 
These forks gives us all the ability to HOLD even more, and I for one, am all for it!

Aren't Jewish people in charge of most of the banks we are talking about? Blaming any race or religion for basic human greed is dumb.

Moon is when we stop caring about Bitcoin's worth in terms of US dollars. 
That said, I'm a literal "moonist". I'll be satisfied when 1 Bitcoin can buy a trip to the moon and back.

What's the point of coming here if there are no memes?  I can just go to Bloomberg if I want straight analysis.

Of course we are. 99.9% the population still thinks bitcoin is only used by the hacker known as 4chan.
