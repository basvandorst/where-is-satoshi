I think in the US. They said that is treated as though you converted to USD and then bought the other altcoin

Why would it be stupid? Spend btc and rebuy with cash. Wouldn’t it be the same?

I have folks at work that take everything they don’t spend for the rent and bills and dump it all into btc and LTC. Saving everything. Crazy stuff. They been doing it since 2013.  Being single also helps. :D

Haha. Yes. But these rewards were laying there for years unused. :D
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:08:30
Depends. Do you have the cash laying around and just profiting off the 0% interest?
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:10:06
Or woman. Or man.  But prob not. They aren’t really objects for purchase.  :P

In the US, Irs has guidelines on accepting btc as a paycheck. It gets taxed as income.  When you cash out or use it again. You either pay gains or loses from that amount from when you got btc.
