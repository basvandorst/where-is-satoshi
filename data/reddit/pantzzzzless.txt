Yep. I've been contributing some front-end work for a few crypto dev teams and almost every one of them I am either 1 of 2, or the only person doing any UI/UX work. I was kinda shocked honestly. I figured there would be way more front-end talent in this space by now as it is a way lower barrier to entry IMO.

Add to this the fact that this technology is still in it's infancy. It works as well as it does at only 10 years old. I can't imagine how smooth it could be in another 10.

So if 3-5% of worldwide BTC users were technically 'not allowed' to use it, you think this would suppress the price? Google is banned in China, that's 20% of the world's population. Google is definitely not suffering because of this.
@_date: 2019-07-12 03:48:24
And what does 'banning' BTC even mean? 
"You are hereforth forbidden to cause your computer to generate a 256-bit hash and send the resulting hash out to a network of nodes."
So... We can't use the internet at all?...
"Well ye.. ummm, hmmmm.... SAD!"

And that's a trade off I am 100% happy with.
You can further mitigate the risk by holding your balances across several wallets. And if so want to transfer $300,000 worth of value without jumping through hoops and being questioned about it, I can. From my bed.
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:44:24
Saying that you *will* eventually be wrong is a bit presumptuous as well though. The truth is that none of us actually know. BTC *could* just continue to rise and thrive, until well after our lifespans. That is just as much a possibility as zeroing out.

Mass adoption won't require an understanding of the technology, but the technology's understanding of people.
It will have to be abstracted to the point of your Gmail app. People will not want to see transactions hashes, or block heights, or even public keys.
They will want an address book, QR scanner, and a ledger that looks like their banking app.
People will not want to have to learn how to generate a new wallet, there will have to be one button that saves your pub/priv key securely so that the user doesn't even know it exists.

When I read "ultra high new worth" I'm think $3+ billion.
So likely $300M in liquid investment funds. So 5% is $15M (all conservative estimates).
@_date: 2018-09-16 03:16:17
Because do you have 'blockchains' to spend on Bitcoin?
Dollars are the current default for almost everyone. So of course the price discovery will use this as it's peg.

But in time, after things are somewhat normalized, stability will be much more common.
The next block reward halving will likely see a huge price pump, and then a slow and steady deflation.
This is all still very new. Let the drama happen now while it doesn't hold massive consequences.

It's so exciting to find someone who knows nothing about it, but is interested in the details.
I could ramble for hours, easily, about just Bitcoin. 
My brother in a law asked me to sit down with him and really get him to understand it. He is a broker at TD Ameritrade and he said a LOT of people have been coming in and asking about BTC, and he didn't want to be uninformed on the technology.
So pulled out a giant piece of paper and by the time we were done I had damn a childrens picture book explaining Blockchain technology written out lol.

You find a wallet that supports the new coins and import your private key.
@_date: 2017-12-06 06:11:18
Let's do a little bit of (very rough) math:
I did some searching and found a rough estimate of how many people use Bitcoin worldwide. It seems to be somewhere between 4 million and 10 million. Really hard to nail that number down. But for this argument's sake, let's just go high and say 10 million.
With 10M people holding BTC, (most not spending it), and not a lot of merchants accepting BTC as payment, we could say likely less than half use it as a daily (even weekly) currency.
Now imagine in 4 years, if most major merchants now accept BTC. Walmart, Amazon, Gas Stations, car dealerships, mobile app stores, etc. Bitcoin is now as normal to use as a gift card would be. 
Right now there are about 17.5 million Bitcoin in circulation. Let's say even 10% of these are lost/destroyed/unspendable. So 16.25 million bitcoin remain.
* Currently at $12,000 USD 
* Not yet merchant friendly
* Completely unknown to the majority of the world
* Only used/owned by ~0.2% of the global population
The estimated total amount of money in circulation *globally* is 60 trillion dollars. ($60,000,000,000,000)
Say in 2022, 25% of the planet are using Bitcoin (scaling issues aside for the argument) at least as a weekly form of payment for *something*. 
The more people using it, and the more transactions going on, more coins will be lost, and also hoarded.
We already see people **only** hodling because the price is skyrocketing. Imagine what people will do when it starts approaching $100,000.
With 2 billion people, using the coin semi regularly, we have the following figures:
There will be 18m total by 2022, so that is around 0.05 Satoshi for each person (remember only 25% of the global population in this excercise).
But they aren't going to be evenly distributed, so let's apply the current percentages of wealth to this because I feel like I've rambled too much.
The average liquid worth of "middle class" Americans is ~$4,500. Or, 0.000000000006% of the total available money. 
Now let's be generous and say after accounting for lost coins, lifelong hodlers, and unspendable coins, the "average" person will have 0.0000001% of a Bitcoin.
This amount is *less than 1 Satoshi*. So again, let's be generous and round it WAY up to a whole Satoshi. 
If equate what the average person likely has, with say 1% of the liquid net worth from above (~$4,500), we have $45 == 0.00000001 BTC.
This would come out to 4.5 billion dollars per BTC, obviously that is not correct, but my likely incoherent brain vomiting hopefully shows how $4M per isn't really that insane to comprehend.

Like the other dude said, most people don't even realize there is a real problem with the current economic system. Without that context, this will likely all sound pointless to them.

Same here. I had always assumed he had hundreds of Bitcoin from the early days. I was pretty shocked to learn that wasn't the case.
This dude's speeches are masterpieces. He has an inspiring air about him, and his presence should absolutely be rewarded by the community.

Well shit, that is a bit more elegant than my essay ��
@_date: 2019-11-22 11:19:55
Think of Bitcoin addresses as complicated email addresses.
When you buy bitcoin (not sure where you bought it, was it coinbase?), your bitcoins will be in a wallet. Think of this wallet as your email account. 
When you want to send bitcoin to someone, they will provide you will a long jumble of letters and numbers. That is the bitcoin address of the recipient. Depending on where you are sending your bitcoin from, when you click 'send' there will be an input box to put the address you want to send the money to. 
COPY and PASTE the address into this box. Do not type it. After you paste it, double and triple check that it is correct. If you have it incorrect, there is a possibility of your money getting tied up for a while, and you don't want that.

You are arguing semantics. He clearly didn't imply that Satoshi *couldn't* be a criminal. 
He was pointing out the absurdity that you brought it up in the first place. Why does it matter if Satoshi had committed a crime? That has nothing to do with the accomplishment of building the Bitcoin protocol.

Is running compression on the ledger file not an option?
@_date: 2017-08-05 23:22:36
Unless you are the only node on the entire network then yes. 
Otherwise, you would have to out work every combined computer currently mining to maintain the longer chain.

Living in the Midwest I could absolutely quit my job with $1,000,000. 
If you make $50k/yr, that is 20 years of your salary. With a paid off house, you're not losing money to interest. And with smart investing and saving, you can live off of dividends and interest alone. Assuming you don't ramp up your lifestyle dramatically.
In a coastal state, it is quite a different story though.

People are celebrating. A lot of people took varying degrees of risk investing in this uncharted territory. And it is paying off big time for a lot of people. They just want to share their excitement with others man. No need to get upset about it.

It generates bitcoins, but not really for free. It costs a lot of electricity to mine Bitcoin. Almost a restrictive amount unless you have a lot of money to invest in equipment.

There's nothing magical about it. You underestimate how easy it can be for someone to scrape together enough personal information about you through your online activity. Most people don't take proper security precautions on the internet and is almost trivial to get an email password, or send them a redirect link to install a keylogger on their computer.

Hypothetically yes. But if the network is ever in a position where it can be profitable to falsify the ledger, then Bitcoin is worthless at that point.

Do you want people to make themselves a target?
@_date: 2017-08-20 09:41:13
I guess, but wouldn't it delay it for a *long* time?
If you could manage a 80% compression ratio on average, that would be a very nice buffer to allow for development of a real solution.

That's the price you pay for being an early adopter. If you ever want crypto to be used daily by a lot of people, then you have to deal with the extra minute or so of effort for a while. 
4 years ago, what we have now would have blown my mind. You used to have to go look the USD value of BTC up yourself before buying something (on a .onion url 99% of the time), just to make sure you didn't send them 10x what you meant to. And there was only one wallet for a while. There wasn't beautiful UI multi currency wallets like Exodus, with fucking Shapeshift built into it.
Just deal with the small inconvenience for a bit, it will pay off for all of us.

It likely wouldn't crash overnight. It would be a slow drawn out process. There is way too much invested at this point for everyone to let it approach zero.

Think of bitcoin as a snake. It gets longer every day.
Then, someone comes along and clones this snake when it is 20 inches long.
You now have two snakes that are 20 inches long. They will each now go do their own thing independent of each other.
When a fork happens, it basically clones the current chain, and if there is enough activity on the new chain then it will continue to be it's own entity. If not, then it will die.
@_date: 2017-08-14 19:44:03
If you believe it will be $50,000 in the future, then it doesn't matter much if you buy now, or if it dips to $3,500. It just matters that you have it.

What the other guy said. You don't have to transfer the coins to a new wallet. Think of a wallet as a virtual "door" to the blockchain. And your private key is the key to open it. Once it's opened, you have access to your coins.
@_date: 2017-11-07 10:06:25
Yeah, look at the blockchain and go to the very first transaction. That is Satoshis's address. Copy that address and look at the balance.

However much Bitcoin you had when the fork happened, you have that much Bitcoin Cash. If you have the private keys to your wallet, you can get the BCH whenever you want. If they were on Coinbase, then you will have to wait until they distribute them.

@_date: 2017-11-08 04:58:10
This is a bit different though. The fact that is not bound to a single country means that over time, it has the potential to detach it's value from the local fiat. If enough people are using it, then goods/services have a potential of adjusting around the currency, Instead of the other way around.
@_date: 2017-11-16 09:11:26
Did you actually send the BTC? If so, what does it say you paid for a transaction fee?

I guess one can't be conscious of more than one issue at a time.
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:48:27
I think if people really believe this technology is worth continued development and progress, then they would stop caring about the current USD value. Is anyone here watching the relative value of USD vs other national currencies? No. They value 1 USD at 1 USD. 
That is the mindset a lot of people here need to adopt unless everyone is just trying to get more cash. Which if that is your intention, then more power to you. But that is not the purpose of this tech.
@_date: 2018-02-14 20:03:15
No, don't you know? You're not a real dev unless you write your own scraping tools to hit every exchange and average the prices out.

I was contemplating buying in about 3 weeks before the 2013 spike, and I talked myself out of it. Come Thanksgiving I saw that it went from $95 to $1,000 and boy was I kicking myself. 
Did I buy in after that? Of course not. I was too scared for some reason. 
I finally took the plunge last month, and am investing a steady 10% / week into BTC and ETH.
