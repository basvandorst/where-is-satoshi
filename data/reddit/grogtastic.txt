This guy doesnt even mention it was a hacked account that caused the problem. The crashed wasnt caused by a normal user dumping their entire wallet onto the market, it was a fraudulent trade.

My rig is currently running 8 HD5830's at ~300Mhash each. It was super easy to edit the bios files in RBE and flash them with atiwinflash. I flashed the cards 3 at a time in a windows machine. For the time it took its the easiest method imo. My core clocks are set to 980 and memory at 275. They run totally stable at this core clock with the stock voltage. 
For pheonix im using:  -k phatk DEVICE=0 VECTORS BFI_INT FASTLOOP=false AGGRESSION=12

Needing to deal with less hardware is definitely a plus though. Whether or not its worth it is entirely up to you. You need really need entire system with a 750 watt psu for 3 cards. Assuming 100$ for the mobo, 30$ for a cpu, 30$ for a HD, and 90$ for a psu thats still only ~580$ for over 900 Mhash. However, your power usage with 5830's is higher.

I suggest you use [this]( instead. He means they are terrible in terms of Mhash/cost of card. For example the 6990 at the highest overclocks put out ~835Mhash/s, and cost 700$. Thats about 1.19Mhash/s per $ spent. A 5830 on the other hand only costs 110$ and gets 300 Mhash/s overclocked. Thats 2.72 Mhash/s per $ spent. You could spent 330$ on 3 Hd 5830's and outpreform your 700$ Hd 6990.

I butchered one of the x4 slots on an old mobo I was trying to mine with. I didnt have anymore thin cutting wheels and ruined quite a few pins at the end. I just taped over the contacts on the card to reduce it to x1 and it worked fine.
