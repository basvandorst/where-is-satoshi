Agreed but that’s the only way to get them quickly or trade.

Exactly. Especially “youtubers” that lie for a living.

Well that’s how poor people view it.

I think the cheaper option would be to just let them die off but apparently we’ve gotten to the point where evolution is only good in theory. 
@_date: 2018-01-29 04:36:56
I pretty much agree with you but I’m in the U.S. where so much money is wasted with “social programming” which is another way of saying “throw money at minorities and hope something changes.”  Shockingly, nothing changes except we keep getting more and more poor people. 
@_date: 2018-01-29 06:41:39
Ya well Quebec has slightly different demographics than the US and your argument relies on continuing to pay for social programming just in different forms for poor people.  
@_date: 2018-01-26 18:42:21
The owners take the money and claim “hackers” got it.  Like Nicehash , bitconnect, etc. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 14:50:07
I believe in LTC making a comeback too but it has nowhere near the lowest fees. 
@_date: 2018-01-15 05:04:36
Well bcash is at $2500 or something so apparently you can.
@_date: 2018-01-29 05:47:08
There’s no way in hell social programming saves money. Saves it how? If you don’t spend it on poor people then you don’t spend it. Where does more get spent later?  If we dropped social programs like paying poor mothers to keep producing more stupid poor kids then we we need less for the next generation. 
There’s no way you can say it costs us more as a country to spend nothing on welfare programs. That literally makes no sense. 
I won’t even get into the ethics of it because I know we disagree there but from a purely fiscal standpoint you cannot make a logical argument as to how it costs us more to cut social programming.

People need to start being held accountable. All of these "hacks" are bad for Crypto. I know 90% of them are just exit scams, but, even if they aren't, the owners should be held to the same consequences. It's their responsibility.

Well no one would invest in the huge risk that is Bitcoin if the gains were only 10% a year. 
Comparing it to a stock isn't really that good because the chance Apple stock drops to zero in any given year is like a million times less likely than Bitcoin.

It’s easy to see where they went (such as the recent Nicehash hack) but who would decide what coins should be banned? 
If someone can do that then your coins could be made worthless at any time and that’s not ideal. 
Also you exchange them into a more secure crypto like Monero and then there’s no trail to follow.

Nope, you set the limit after it hits your stop.  There is no guarantee you'll get a buyer but they still can only sell at or above the limit.

Ya it’s not really $500 but besides that it should be the same ��
@_date: 2017-12-02 02:56:56
 but unless your paid in them (which no one is) you have to buy them?
@_date: 2017-12-03 19:54:55
They could coincide but I don’t think most tech companies are too dependent on crypto as of now. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 01:09:16
If Coinbase pulled an exit scam tomorrow your BTC would probably be nearly worthless anyway.

Ya well if you can move the price of Bitcoin around at will then you have no need to worry about if your futures will make money.
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:57:14
That’s good. I’ll go with that lol
@_date: 2017-12-17 23:18:07
It makes sense right now actually. People will need food for the foreseeable future so those futures are a safe bet.  
Right now, no one needs Bitcoin.  Maybe it will change in 2018 but right now Bitcoins only use is as a “store of value”.  You can use it here and there as currency but who would when its value is increasing. 
In today’s market , hogs are a much safer investment. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 15:04:36
It’s just a title. Who cares
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:54:05
Oh I think those companies are safe. I’m talking about the companies getting huge valuations with little to no actual business. A lot of it has become speculation and the VCs business is now more selling hope to other investors than actual businesses. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 01:07:59
Where do you expect people to buy coins then? They have to get them from somewhere if the want them. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 23:19:18
Do you think Bitcoin will be the end of debt ? Lol no, you’ll just owe in a different currency. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:26:35
Not unless you have an address, bank account in a different country, I.D. etc that show you are in a country where it’s available. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 03:48:09
I don’t think XRP will ever make $50 but it could easily pass BTC in market cap if it begins to be used by financial institutions and or goes to Coinbase.  
Right now BTC’s value is pure speculation and first mover advantage. If it doesn’t adapt quicker it will be passed by not only Ripple but probably ETH and a few other cryptos in 2018. I think 2018 will be a good year for crypto but all Bitcoin has on its side is the name ATM.

What? A source the dollar hasn’t increased in value drastically lately? Umm exchange rates?
@_date: 2017-11-09 01:15:44
     Bitcoin isn’t unique as there are millions of them so that’s a moot point.   It’s not the Mona Lisa so you can’t just name your price. Buyers only “want” an asset (Bitcoin/house/car/whatever) at a set price point.  
        For instance you could put you 3 bedroom home in Indiana on the market for $8 million but that means nothing because the buyers decide how much they are willing to pay and if you price it higher than that then no one will buy it and it therefore has no market value until you list it at a reasonable price (as much as the highest bidding buyer has decided they will pay for it).  
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:00:54
Only if you use a bank account. It can be instant with a credit or debit card. Your price is locked in though so you’ll still get any profit if it goes up in those 8 days.  Unfortunately you’ll also lose if the price drops in those 8 days.

Ya but then it wouldn’t be air probably. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 01:21:50
It can also be slower,  just a heads up. Most bitcoin evangelists won’t be honest with you but Bitcoin is slow and the fees are ridiculously high. 
I think it’s a great investment but you’re better off buying Litecoin through GDAX (part of coinbase) and setting another limit order to trade for Bitcoin. That way Coinbase won’t fuck you on the price coming and going. (They always charge more than market for instant orders).   
Also just know you’ll pay another fee to get it off the exchange into your own wallet if you feel the need to. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:29:32
It wouldn’t be as effective without control of the miners though. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:51:17
Yep. Everyone is pretending that BTC will moon short term but I see a pullback coming as everyone realizes there’s no more free coins.  I am bullish long term but I see it going sideways the next month at best.

@_date: 2017-11-06 00:31:56
I could see 10k by 11-15 but a correction before 11-22. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:05:04
For you and me but for most people they’d have to set up an account first which is way harder than just typing in the cc info. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 13:45:48
It already has. They already used tether to hike the price of BTC and now they can magically  “get hacked “ of $30 million.  
I don’t care if people downvote, it’s very clear BTC’s price has been inflated by fake money. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 18:59:08
Lol true 
@_date: 2017-11-23 15:04:38
Rodger is a hard core shill but he’s right about the Average fee being way higher for BTC. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:01:26
You are but the big money doesn’t care about the tech. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 16:50:56
Odds are he wouldn't be in his car to brag then lol
@_date: 2017-11-12 22:17:29
Come on you can’t pretend 20% in 3 days isn’t a big deal. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 21:48:45
Eventually it would but it means nothing if there’s no reason for the miners to come back bc the price has fallen. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 03:26:17
No one cares about the difference in exchange rates you know what he was asking. Go preach your Anti-America bullshit somewhere else. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 19:32:12
So your solution to make Bitcoin anonymous is to just use Monero? Lol
@_date: 2017-11-09 14:59:02
Yes this is true there will only be 21 million  but they will continue to be mined for over 120 years.  I don’t know how people think 21 million is scarce.  Just because something isn’t unlimited doesn’t make it scarce. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 14:28:13
Exactly and currently bitcoin has the liquidity of a stock or bond at best not that of currency. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 00:59:05
No price and value are the same thing when it comes to assets. Buyers determine the price/value of an asset not holders. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 14:28:27
If America is way behind then 90% of the world is still in the dark ages. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 22:59:36
No there’s no qualifiers. If you’re selling and the price goes up after you made a mistake.  If the price goes down you were right and the buyer made a mistake.  It doesn’t matter how you acquired the coins. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 03:48:56
Go ahead and mine it with gpus then and see how much you get. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 23:14:22
Don’t do it. You’re looking through rose colored glasses at the past. Bitcoin goes up and down. You can’t stomach the down with borrowed money or money you need for rent. You’ll panic sell and be in worse shape. Just wait. There’s plenty of growth to come : )
@_date: 2017-11-10 01:27:06
Show me where coinbase is supporting it? I call bs
@_date: 2017-11-06 05:22:51
Yep people didn’t know what to do the first time. This time will be a fire sale because people are wise to the scam.
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:57:00
Ya it’s more like 13x and despite what everyone thinks going from $1,000 to 10,000 is a whole lot easier than $10k to $100,000
@_date: 2017-11-15 19:09:43
Lol yes I know how they work.  That’s just a web wallet then. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 18:21:57
SJW ? Do you know what that means. I’m about as far from that as you can get. I’m just saying they’re poor lol 
@_date: 2017-11-23 00:08:05
Nothing goes up forever. Sell when you need it only or when you believe it’s no longer a wise investment. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 03:04:53
One thing bitcoin will never be is scarce. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 05:41:18
Take your politics back to 
@_date: 2017-11-09 16:05:38
Yes and if everyone demanded 30 gallons of milk tomorrow the cost of milk would skyrocket but that scenario is just as fake as everyone in the world wanting 1 bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-14 04:36:03
No if you don’t have the bitcoin you won’t get any additional coins during a fork. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 22:18:25
Yep. Ppl are jumping ship and the only bottleneck is BTC itself. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 21:51:09
Open source doesn’t equal communism. Bitcoin are privately owned and represents literally the opposite ideals of socialism/communism. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:59:51
     Anyone can fork but the question is does that version of Bitcoin hold value. That’s why I think BCH was so bad for Bitcoin. It showed people that they can dilute BTC’s brand to make free money. I hope this shuts down future forks but given that people like money I seriously like doubt it. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 00:06:41
Still once the shares are on the market the same thing applies. I guess it doesn't apply when nothing is for sale but that's obvious.
@_date: 2017-11-20 01:49:03
Oh cool. I didn’t know that. I haven’t used coinbase in a while. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 01:11:48
I could see even $3.2m possibly 
@_date: 2017-11-16 16:49:48
Don't tell her then lol
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:51:16
I don’t think you know what a bubble is. There’s been little to no growth in USD lately. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 01:09:14
Unfortunately it’s not instant. Usually around 40 min. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 19:59:18
We never went further though so the actual moon was humanity's moon so far.
@_date: 2017-11-23 00:39:09
Not if it doesn’t get adopted.  The bad thing about BTC is it’s only advantage is first mover. Anyone who wants can copy it or create something better.  
Right now none of the cryptos are really used so everyone is just speculating. However, if cryptos become the norm instead of the exception then competition will increase and some other crypto could win out by being faster, cheaper, cooler, whatever. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 22:22:38
After the last 3 days you really doubt ppl are conspiring to bring down BTC? Maybe it fails but I wouldn’t bet my bag on it failing. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 04:26:50
Those people don’t have internet or modern skills. How are you going to give them Bitcoin? It will have to go through some intermediary. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 20:22:06
Make sure they send it fast to your coinbase unless you want to hang out with a stranger for 45 min lol
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:32:52
While I agree with you sentiment, Please don’t use PayPal as an example.  They are more centralized and authoritarian than banks. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 18:51:06
My number is $50,000. I’m not saying it’ll happen but that’s the number where I sell everything and retire. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 05:24:28
Except he didn’t mention the part where Bitcoins price drops too because a lot of the new interest is in getting free money from the fork. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 23:11:52
Ya no one’s perfect and crypto is still new enough that it’s manipulated. What matters is at the end of the day do you have more or less BTC than the night before.  I make mistakes and sell early/ buy late but I’m headed in the right direction so I don’t beat myself up over losing some here and there. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 19:12:03
The government will regulate Bitcoin as an asset. If it ever actually becomes a real currency they’ll shut it down. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 18:31:24
Say bitcoin was at $7000 and went to $3500 (just for a round number) and BCH was $600 and went to $1200.  If miners were only making 10% more in Bitcoin than BCH before those price changes would it not be way more profitable for them to mine BCH now?  I don't think the difficulty of BCH would almost double; which is what would have to do to keep bitcoin mining more profitable. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 17:36:42
The irony is that the value of both coins rest squarely on Chinese miners. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:26:09
Well cash and debit cards are way easier than PayPal. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 18:22:18
Not if the difficulty of BCH is so much lower. They don't have to make BCH more valuable just mining more valuable. Then the rest will take care of itself because without the miners there is no bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-10 01:13:58
Lol ok. Try to pump that crap elsewhere 
@_date: 2017-11-15 13:58:36
What? How did you get that lol
@_date: 2017-11-07 21:05:15
They could easily shut it down. Go after the nodes just like they did with Tor. They could even just buy them all if they wanted too. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 13:54:56
Bitcoin is barely money. More of an asset at the moment. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:32:00
Literally 100 times as much money would have to Dow into bitcoin to take it from $1000 to $100k
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:14:51
You can actually and you can’t currently do much with the bitcoin someone sends you without a third party to convert it to $ anyway. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 21:50:59
It might shock you that most people with money and nice cars dress more like this than rappers. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 18:31:26
Well if you want to look outside of the "system" of the one investment we were looking in then in your example the buyer made the wrong decision because he should have invested it in the other venture with a higher return that the seller did.
@_date: 2017-11-16 17:56:08
Lol I like the car. Not hurting anyone by showing it off :)
@_date: 2017-11-09 16:22:03
And More supply creates less scarcity. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:33:28
Lol no one wins until we can use just Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-11-11 18:19:29
Not if they drive a lot of the money out of BTC first. Then it will be so much more profitable to mine BCH that anyone acting in their own best interests would be forced to switch. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 18:55:28
I’ve seen these in a couple data centers and they have huge condensers above the fluid to recycle it. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 19:44:39
Ya but why use bitcoin at all then?
@_date: 2017-11-10 15:18:15
Eh 50% of the people at any given time are making the wrong decision. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 01:10:53
I mean the address and balance is public but it might not be linked to him in any way. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 16:13:23
By your definition everything is scarce because we can pretend that in the future some people will want more but we really don't know. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 15:34:38
No i mean that for every buyer there is a seller so half of the people are making the wrong decision. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 22:23:20
I was referring to BTCs losses 
@_date: 2017-11-30 04:30:28
Ya through an intermediary.  There’s no such thing as cash to cash directly.  
@_date: 2017-11-13 22:41:18
Maybe he made a huge purchase at $8,000
@_date: 2017-11-09 00:22:41
No the costs of property only actually goes up when someone buys it (puts money into it).  All the estimates of a property’s “value” mean nothing. It’s only worth as much as someone is willing to pay for it.
@_date: 2017-11-09 03:10:10
But gold has a physical functional value. Bitcoin is just code that currently produces nothing. Evaluating it like a company would be a real stretch since it can’t really harness its users in any valuable way. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 20:59:02
Yep thiers no difference 
@_date: 2017-11-07 19:17:23
It already failed when it let BCH become a thing. The forks won’t stop now and it’ll continue to dilute bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:36:38
So 50/50 it goes up or down and you wrote an algorithm about BTC 4 years ago but just joined the sub last week?  Ok dude 
@_date: 2017-11-07 18:57:43
But what if 2x is Bitcoin ?
@_date: 2017-11-07 20:20:29
Ya but they can’t sell something they don’t have right?
@_date: 2017-11-15 22:49:51
Maybe he has a solid strategy consisting of moving stops and rebuy orders. Jk most ppl here just hope the price keeps going up. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 15:23:12
So you think every time Bitcoin decides to fork it will just magically create $600 of free money? I think it was a one time thing but we will see.
@_date: 2017-11-06 16:53:33
Seriously. I don’t get all these people who are pro bitcoin but then want to pay 20% tax. Fuck that I’m not paying tax on any of it. The government didn’t regulate bitcoin or help it in any way. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 19:03:40
I think the disdain comes because they believe there is a lot of collusion going on with the miners in China. I didn't really think so before but with this BCH thing now it's possible.
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:13:39
I’m not saying BCH is better just that it might win. Still to be seen. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 05:38:24
No, more are mined daily. Maybe in 100 years but if bitcoin exists we will all be dead. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 18:57:46
Ya but that’s only bc of the recent price rise. Factor in that you can resell the $650 card and the difference doesn’t seem as huge. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 20:19:16
Coinbase/GDAX. You have to be 18 though. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 16:04:49
Something tells me the everyday citizens of Zimbabwe and Venezuela aren't going to be able to buy a lot of bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 18:51:04
Why would any miners go back to BTC if BCH is more profitable? Are you saying they'd leave because the difficulty would adjust up and make mining BCH less profitable again than BTC? 
 Also I think all of your conclusions are based on each individual miner doing what is best for themselves every minute and no large groups or manipulation which is clearly what it looks like is happening.  Would you rather mine BCH at a loss now and a 50% gain in 2 days or BTC at a gain of 10% now and a loss of 20% in 2 days?
@_date: 2017-11-15 19:04:54
Then you lose your phone you lose the keys?
@_date: 2017-11-18 18:56:19
China could always come out and drive the price down again 
@_date: 2017-11-14 03:17:33
Wrong sub. You can’t mine bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:50:29
Exactly. Every bank has more money to invest than every person in this sub combined. We need big money to keep growing. 
@_date: 2018-03-02 23:03:12
Ya and since I'm paid in $ the government already gets their taxes before I could even buy BTC with it. This liberal agenda Bullshit has nothing to do with BTC and should be banned.
@_date: 2018-03-03 00:24:10
This whole thing is about the U.S. being involved in the Middle East particularly Yemen and how that’s somehow “bad”.  But I say keep Supporting the Saudis because the Middle East is a backwards cesspool and I don’t want any of that in the U.S.  We’re doing just fine compared to pretty much anyone. 
@_date: 2018-03-03 04:14:41
Well most of that money goes to poor Americans in the army and to American businesses. It’s not foreign aid at least. 
@_date: 2018-03-03 02:14:47
Ok then why don’t we cut welfare and see how fast we get out of debt. I guess it’s only the military wasting money right?
@_date: 2018-02-09 05:23:21
Not really. Smart don’t pay state income tax at all. 
@_date: 2018-02-12 01:23:23
I just wanna get directions for my Segway on my Google Glass. Is that too much to ask ??
-Trust fund “programmer”
@_date: 2018-02-27 04:39:20
It would be interesting to see what would happen if any of that BTC moved. My feeling is the price would dive as it’d be apparent someone could manipulate it at will. 
@_date: 2018-03-31 02:16:19
Exactly. I’m a big believer in crypto but people comparing to Amazon is ridiculous.  
Even if Amazon went bankrupt, (which at this point would almost take the U.S. economy going down worse than in 1929 and that would most likely pull BTC down with it too) they’d still have have tangible assets like land, buildings, IP, etc. 
People pretending Bitcoin isn’t riskier than the stock market are either hardcore believers or naive. 
@_date: 2018-03-02 23:05:32
Have you been to fucking Yemen? I'm guessing no. But trust me when I tell you that whatever the U.S. is doing they should keep on doing because it's a pretty nice place to live compared to 99% of the world.
@_date: 2018-02-19 20:03:06
But they are open lol
@_date: 2018-02-27 04:28:26
Pretty sure the same things been happening since credit/debit cards started to be accepted at those places. 
@_date: 2018-02-09 19:55:03
They probably use bitcoin for the real laundering. 
@_date: 2018-02-23 22:40:08
Well you've already fucked up if they know you have Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-02-12 19:52:32
Maybe every country should just have their own mining facility and bitcoin wallet and then it will be completely decentralized. We can then call the facilities banks and be back at square one.
@_date: 2018-02-04 00:29:04
You and I might have,  but a lot of people have only seen down since Xmas. 
@_date: 2018-03-06 18:23:41
Ya because it'd cost like $4K to ship it there
@_date: 2018-02-22 23:01:22
Not as much as Venezuela lol 
@_date: 2018-02-23 22:40:48
No you were right the first time. No reason to be PC. Venezuela is a shithole.
@_date: 2018-02-27 04:14:13
Well he never saw any of that money either way.
