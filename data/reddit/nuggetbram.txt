Generally they aren't going to make you anything unless you set them up really well, and if you have the knowledge to do that you can typically trade yourself successfully

There's nothing really preventing Bitcoin payment systems from having a cellular backup like most credit card terminals are

I theory you could trawl through it manually, but you'd be long dead before you get anywhere meaning. Even with programming experience it's an odd mix between trivial and difficult - scraping the transaction data itself wouldn't be difficult, but making something of the mass of info you'll get would not be an easy task

In order for a transaction to occur, record of the Bitcoins entering the account that wants to spend them must be present in the blockchain. Therefore you could effectively scrape the whole transaction history to see where they all ended up

Hi guys, I made this during the last huge rally when I wanted to keep an eye on the price (especially when it was +5% in 1 hr etc), and I don't think any other apps do this. It's still very basic, but I've added a couple more currencies and prettied it up a bit. Good for parties, but only if a single person at the party is also interested in Bitcoin (good luck)
Edit: Android only, I'm very rusty with ios
