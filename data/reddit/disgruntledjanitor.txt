You know, I've always held that the people who are first to wave the anarchist flag will be the first ones to be mangled by roving gangs of methheads with chainsaws. Law and order is still important, in its place. The main issues I have with modern (and historical ) governance is that people are greedy, selfish and corrupt. Me, I can't wait for skynet.

Things are at a point where it's impossible to predict. Bitcoin has potential to really take off - it could potentially replace Paypal and Western Union one day, for example. But bitcoin needs at least one killer app before we can say anything.
In other words, I think that unless a "big surprising something" happens within, I'd guess two months or so, people will get bored and go back to taking pictures of their cats.

When we're done mining coins we should totally compute the fuck out of some goddamned science.
@_date: 2011-06-22 07:12:59
While bitcoin itself, the concept &amp; software, are probably to be considered at a public beta level of development, the grand socioeconomic structure built around it is just leaving the brainstorming phase. 
That it got so much press and the fact that you don't have to have lots of extra money lying around to adopt this technology is the only reason there is such a large numbers of these "beta testers".
@_date: 2011-06-10 05:01:37
The things you talk about aren't properties of any particular currency. They are "things people do with money". Provided this economic experiment is successful, Bitcoin will undoubtedly spawn Big Evil Corporations. Greedy people don't care what form their money takes, just so long as they have it. And of course there will be scams, and fraud, and shady schemes... this isn't a problem with bitcoin so much as with human nature.

The bright side of all this fuckery is that hackers exist in the wild, regardless of their own personal ambitions, to search for and exploit vulnerabilities in a system. System operators must then develop countermeasures, which means added security for users. 
Basically, it's an inorganic evolution of a currency (and the infrastructure &amp; economy that comes with it) that may, under the right conditions, become an unstoppable juggernaut.

no, if someone scoops my debit card, they only have half the equation - they need my PIN. And yes, there are dummy POS terminals that scoop PINs and other shenanigans, but at least there aren't armies of invisible robots roaming around sniffing out my debit card/PIN combo in meatspace (a more accurate comparison to the trojans). And if I lose my card I can call the bank and have them disable it. I lose my wallet and it's gone forever.

Thanks. Does that entail pulling the bridge out, or just a reboot? 
@_date: 2011-06-17 19:35:03
Thanks! I am a fan of Bitcoin despite its current shortcomings, but because of the societal concepts behind it. I have great respect for the knowledge and dedication of those who are trying to help others get their wallets secure, but their patience is going to wear very thin if simple, elegant solutions aren't discovered.
@_date: 2011-06-17 20:30:55
If you could teach a 9 year old, you should totally run seminars on this stuff. Not everyone can learn without human guidance, and you'd probably make a small fortune.
@_date: 2011-06-11 18:20:39
I think there's a site that shows where there are people who sell BTC in-person for cash. It was listed on Bitcoin's site somewhere.

Huh. I haven't been able to get on Silk Road all week, and I have money in there. They're all 504 from this end.

Holding. I invested fifty bucks, now I have like $1500. If we crash, I'm only out fifty bucks.

How about this, this is within the range of my feeble powers:
* Create two wallets, checking &amp; savings.
* Create passworded 7zip archive of savings. Keep password only in a password manager.
* Put this archive on a flash drive (and a backup onto a cd or something)
* Fileshredder the original file.
*Hope I remember where I put the archive and the password and how to work all this stuff when I want to access it.
Is this relatively safe, or are ninjas going to break into my house and loot my wallet?
@_date: 2011-06-13 23:58:29
Whatever happens, I am certain of one thing: everything that can be done to stop Bitcoin will be done. I think we'll see increasing numbers of DDoS attacks, rogue speculators getting paid off to try and crash the market, increasing negative press... in short, interesting times are ahead.
@_date: 2011-06-13 02:56:50
Yes, it is very awesome. I can buy or sell and have cash in hand in *hours*.
@_date: 2011-06-18 06:41:55
I'm sure they'll be out of beta in a reasonable piece of time. Til then I guess we're stuck with private sales and other inconvenient methods. Pretty soon though people will be selling BTC on Craigslist for cash (thinking about doing this but I don't have the volume for it).
@_date: 2011-06-10 05:28:32
I bought $50 worth about 6 months ago, not sure if I'm ready to sell off entirely. One one hand, I have more money in my Bitcoin Wallet than in my bank account, on the other hand I'd kick myself for selling too early if we see another crazy spike in value.
Think I might sell just 5-10 BTC to upgrade my video card situation.

This is HUGE. A major hurdle to mass adoption has been gracefully swept aside. Thanks for bringing this to my attention!
@_date: 2011-06-10 14:03:56
But the question here is, *do you accept bitcoin?* 
@_date: 2011-06-10 21:58:12
Yeah, I know what you mean. But I only spent a piddly $50 of my cash for my 50 bitcoins so yes, in that scenario I would of course be out $1500, but my initial investment is still fifty dollars.

Encrypt, disguise encrypted file as some crappy spyware program by renaming, bury it in a million nested folders (all named in hex or binary numbers) full of junk files, burn it onto a cd, wrap in lead foil, put that in a coffee can, put that in a box full of other junk, put the box in your grandma's attic and *never tell anyone, ever*.
@_date: 2011-06-13 20:45:45
I like your attitude. :)
@_date: 2011-06-12 18:33:44
Mwahaha, I bought 10 BTC last night, doubled my money this morning.
@_date: 2011-08-10 18:53:49
Man, I was hoping the price would stay around $7 (or less) until payday... I cashed out all my coins a couple months ago to fix my car. :(

At this point paying through the nose for a dedicated mining rig and the power it consumes is viable, as you could re-sell the hardware if at some point you fell you no longer need it. However it requires substantial initial investment. I have a gaming pc which mines when I'm not gaming (20 hours a day - I'm a busy guy), at 192 mhash I'm getting (very approximately guesstimating ballpark figure/conjecture/wild guess) 1 coin per week. At current prices then, it would take me roughly 2 months just to pay off a $150 video card, not included the power it uses.
What I'm thinking of doing, is taking the $5 a week I spend on lottery tickets (yeah I know, dumb waste of money) and spending it on coins. It's definitely not a certain investment, but at least my odds aren't quite as astronomical as playing the super lotto. All I'm saying is, don't invest what you aren't prepared to lose. And spend some coins to stimulate the economy!
@_date: 2011-06-10 05:36:28
It could happen. I think a lot of us are hoping that people will seize upon Bitcoin as being the de facto cryptocurrency as recognized by the majority. Even if a new standard was better, people don't like change (hence why some people still use Limewire).
@_date: 2011-06-17 07:56:51
So, just to keep my money safe I need to endure all this rigmarole every time I want to spend a coin or 2? I'm just gonna hoard.

That's what's so impressive here. Despite the spike and dip, faith in BTC remains unwavering. If BTC were traded on Wall Street it would be raining suicidal investors right now.

*This* is why bitcoin won't see even remotely mainstream adoption. I don't even know what half that shit means. I'm not a particularly ignorant savage either, but damn if people like me will be bothered to learn this kind of stuff.

Hey, I may be an idiot, but I'm an idiot who has an extra $500 in his pocket and more coins waiting to appreciate (or not, I don't much care as I  only bought $50 worth a couple months ago). You could say, "stupider like a fox!"

@_date: 2011-06-28 07:10:42
I figure the bottleneck here is that there is still virtually little to no infrastructure (more accessible exchanges, adoption by retail *en masse*, etc)  around it, which inhibits mass adoption. Actually then there will be exponential growth.
It *could* happen. Maybe.

The drug trade is a major part of why we're seeing this rally. Silk Road and the controversy surrounding it have given BTC a lot of publicity.

"You can buy drugs off the internet." (kidding, but I maintain that Silk Road, however one may feel about the products sold or the controversy surrounding it, has been a major driving force for BTC, and it is actually a very well-thought-out marketplace in terms of design and implementation).
