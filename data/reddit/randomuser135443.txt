I will buy some from you, but only in person...
@_date: 2018-01-22 04:41:31
Maybe they should buy bitcoin...

You can fix two of your problems by feeding the homeless to the poor.

Was interested but $46?  Fuck you.
@_date: 2017-12-15 01:56:28
Buy those coins!
@_date: 2017-12-06 05:19:15
Sell one of the kids.  Cuts down on costs and allows you to buy more bitcoin.  Win win.

I want to hear from our North Korean bitcoin enthusiasts.   Anyone?
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:24:03
It just broke $18000

I just activated my Amazon gift cards on Sat...

It's a lose lose situation.  Keep investing and you might lose her.  Don't invest and you will resent her  more and more as Bitcoin goes up.
@_date: 2017-12-06 16:44:17
So I guess they will have to keep buying bitcoin then.

Coinbase.  Its been a little bit of a pain with having to upload drivers license and take selfies, but worth it overall.

Doesn't say it will be your fortune...  Maybe a sugar daddy will pick you up.

What about the people who commit suicide because they sold at $500?  Seems like the ultimate "I'm out."

Just look forward to the day when you can buy him his dream car and then spray paint "paid for by bitcoin"  all over it.

I'm using Gdax and Tradingview.  Tradingview lets you do stocks, ETFs and other currency as well.  You can also set up two reminders for free to text your phone when a certain price is hit.

Same thing happened to me.  Cleared it with them and it went through second time.  Makes sense since buying bitcoin with stolen credit cards is probably pretty common.
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:49:10
Smash all smart objects connected to your wifi too.  Your fridge is stealing your bitcoin...
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:55:49
Trading view has all your charting needs

I only have half a bitcoin right now, bought at $8400 last week.  I'm looking to hold and add to my position over the next 5 to 10 years.  Probably sell when its worth $100k or more.
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:04:55
End of 2017?
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:58:28
I just bought one today if that helps.
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:21:47
It would have to be Block Chainz
@_date: 2018-02-03 19:02:25
It's a show.  Always Sunny In Philadelphia.
