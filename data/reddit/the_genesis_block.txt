Not sure why you got downvotes, maybe people don’t get the GNU reference. I like the recursive acronym idea!

It’s not an acronym.

In my experience both the Trezor and Ledger Nano S devices are very good. 
My experience with Ledger customer support is terrible, where Trezor customer support has been great. 
My 2 satoshis.

Trezor for coldwallet, bread for hotwallet (phone).

I have my node running on Raspbian rather than Ubuntu, but I did it with a cron job. 
Type crontab -e in the terminal to edit your cron table. 
The following line works for me:
 bitcoind -daemon

Just fired up my first node last week, almost fully synced!

Could be the date of the first bitcoin block mined, January 3rd.

Hal Finney or Nick Szabo seem like the most likely candidates. But then I wonder about the details that point to someone with a background or connection to the UK, e.g. use of the word ‘bloody’ and the genesis block message of The Times headline.

I’m with you! Lone noder here.

Awesome! Saves me from opening an app, nice work. 
@_date: 2017-10-16 15:59:58
There is an option in checkout to pay with bitcoin.

Blocks don’t stop being mined, even after the reward goes away in  ~2140. Blocks contain transactions and mining is the only way new transactions (packaged as a block) get confirmed and added to the blockchain. Miners will still compete (hash the block data and try to find an output starting with a string of zeroes) to be the first to mine a block.  If they do, they are given the transaction fees from the transactions in that block. That is true today and will continue even after the halving schedule eliminates the reward.
