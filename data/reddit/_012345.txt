ehm people should still have a moral compass
most atrocities happen because people only 'follow orders'

it's a ponzie scheme
Eventually those left standing with bitcoin after the game of musical chairs ends will be fucked
But hey a bunch of gamblers, drug dealers, and pyramid scheme running sociopaths and mafia will have made a bunch of money off the misery of those people! totally worth destroying the environment for with an insane amount of electricity useage

it's a real ponzi scheme allright
And a massive waste of natural resources (insane amounts of energy wasted by each transaction)

The worst thing about that is that he eventually did get a liver transplant after it was too late. A transplant he wouldn't have needed in the first place if he had gotten treatment before the cancer spread.
The tragedy : some poor innocent soul who needed a new liver got knocked down on the list (and everyone below him got knocked down a spot too) for a wealthy, delusional narcissist who it was totally wasted on.
Someone died because of this fucker. Someone who didn't have to die.

And someone who refused treatment initially and waited for the cancer to spread wouldn't be accepted on a transplant list in a million years normally. They don't take kindly to self destructive behavior when there are plenty of people waiting for a new organ who have a better chance to live and won't just self sabotage.
+they knew in advance his odds were slim once the cancer had spread, that would disqualify you (or knock you WAY down on the list) if you're not a  billionaire as well.
