No. It's usury really. And fractional reserve usury is the worst. 
Money is ok. It's cool to get rewarded for hard work or invention. 
@_date: 2017-08-06 02:26:45
Do you genuinely believe that?

They own most of the gold. Something like 2/3rds of all gold is owned by the IMF. Their power increases with an increase in the value of gold. You want to join them but make them more powerful.

Bittrex gave it straight away. Don't be upset with yourself. Life goes on.

Street music is nice. They will probably eventually get card readers though.

What's wrong with you? It's a fork. You could call one bitcoin and one segwit coin. They're forked.

I hate those bank tactics

You can have money without usury. England did it for hundreds of years.

there are valid arguments for not wanting segregated witness. it's not nice to call it garbage.

Medium of exchange should be easy to buy stuff. If you want to reward a street musician for his lovely music it's difficult to get out a chisel to chip off some of your commodity. Notes and coins are pretty easy. 
@_date: 2017-08-06 02:30:22
Well written post. 
The money masters want us microchipped, and people will want it. There will be more and more stories about how it'll keep your kids safe and how convenient it is to be chipped. 
Let's get out of our doom.

wait for it to fall a bit more is what aschol is saying
@_date: 2017-11-11 14:35:08
yeah.. you can really just go with the scaled buys if wanting to buy in.. bit now, bit more if lower, even more if lower, etc

many probably have bugs, but it's early days.
i've had fun on funfair's demo games, i have enjoyed using brave browser, and it was an excellent feeling connecting to ether delta with metamask rather than logging into an exchange.
the dapps ecosystem is just budding. the future is bright.

well, it better keep up with features of new coins. it's got its brand name but has a fight on its hands to be what people want to exchange their goods and labor for.
@_date: 2017-09-13 11:17:29


why the guess in that direction?
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:36:26


new ideas are had and improvements to dapps are made
anyway, i think you are right although i'm tempted to bet on less than 3 months against your 3-6 months.
@_date: 2018-02-02 09:44:21
'lose' is probably misspelled because of the long double-o sound in the pronunciation.

@_date: 2017-05-29 07:50:30
not necessarily. they aren't all the same.
it can be that an altcoin works the best for what it does. there could be many successful altcoins, successful in different ways, even if bitcoin were to die.
you could be right but it isn't absolute.

you can't say your mind because someone annoying yells 'sexist!' or 'racist!' when the thing should allowed to be discussed. thought police stuff.
they seem hypocritical with their hate. being bigoted against who they have a problem with.

'pseudo' is a fuzzy word.
if i'm like the only person to use a certain phrase, it's not so anonymous. there is identity in the words themselves
i use double dots a lot.. like that. it's a part of my habits of ways to write. i also use a lot of lowercase. there are many fingerprints in people's words.
i could change it if i wanted to be anonymous but then i'm altering my identity, my self, as well.
@_date: 2017-06-25 04:59:39
that's hilarious.
@_date: 2017-06-25 05:21:53
it's a significant piece of human history. it's sticking around and will have the whole planet using it. 1 satoshi could be like a cent in the future.. and a whole bitcoin, that could be a mansion like the celebrities have.

they are individuals, not one 'it'.

i can feel that bear. i have nothing to buy with. everything is down. i can't handle selling at a loss. just in limbo. feels like hibernation.
