Well if it was Ethereum you could use a Smart Contract .... on Death it would get triggered and send proportions to the next of kin. Or the miner could setup a transaction in the future on MyCrypto to trigger unless he cancelled it and renewed the date... say 6 month intervals to be updated 3 months before activation... to be on the safe side.

It just goes to show Ethereum is light years ahead... bitcoin chain will split at some stage, just a matter of time. Then everyone can say "I told you so". Bitcoin community is just so divided.

As soon as it goes too high they will stamp on I again... they can only do that so often before bitcoin will crash as incestors will see a "no hope of rising" situation.... only then will they pile out into other Altcoins. I'm just waiting for the day. Meanwhile buy some ICONOMI to spread your risk over a basket of Altcoins....

Bitcoin won't reach $10,000 let alone $3,000 anytime soon... the Chinse PBOC won't let it. But yes the Facbook people are very naive. I'm more for Ethereum based stuff now. But it's thanks to bitcoin that Ethereum exists at all. Time to live on.

I've used a paper wallet... Printed on elephant... Practically indestructible.. Apart from fire. Now I use a ledgerwallet Nano. Works a treat. Even banks get robbed. I'm not going to get paranoid. With Ledgerwallet I at least "feel" safe when they are in there..

Why work with a donkey when you have a thoroughbred in the stables?.... ethereum.

 I feel for you. It only takes one slip of concentration.

My question.... why did you leave 6btc on Bittrex In the first place...?
@_date: 2015-03-07 06:41:05
I agree with most on here. We are buying into the email of the future. Most people said back then why would I ever want to send an email. Crypto currency will survive in one form or another. Whether Bitcoin the first wave currency manages to survive is still a BIG question. I really hope that it evolves and adapts to its challenges. At present it is... That's why I'm slowly buying. I've mined for BTC and PPC .... Was great fun but buying direct is so much easier. 21,000,000 is the end! As this time gets closer I'm sure that the infrastructure will provide a reason to carry on. If you hold on to 1 or 1000 you have bought a part of the digital payment net. It's just like the telecom companies paying for the airwaves... They are forking out millions for something the government has invented when actually it's provided by nature for free. Bitcoin is only worth as much as the public perceive. If the infrastructure improves so will usage and then so will the value. At one stage it was only worth a few cents... The big problem to come over is the gold price as a human will have difficulty comprehending that a Btc could be worth more than an ounce of the precious metal. I invest in many things... Diamonds gold banknotes... It's the mix that makes it fun and less risky. Bitcoin belongs to this mix that I'm sure of. I bought a diamond for €3850 before Christmas the same diamond would cost €5030 now. This is because of the supply and demand factor. Diamonds can be found for eternity on Earth (very difficult to find them though) Bitcoin mining ends in 2040 or there about. Diamonds are only CABON but someone including me thinks they are valuable. I also invest in diamond mines enabling me to buy the real thing with the profits. So my advice is tuck away a few of these worthless things and take a small risk. Don't put your pension in. There is so much going on behind the scenes..

Well I got a $2000 refund from Butterfly labs. I did an upgrade after upgrade and eventually pilled into their Mining by Gh... 167gh to be precise. I must admit I'd written the $2000 off but I kept the faith and got it paid back in full. I have now used some of the money to buy Bitcoin as I still believe in it. I'll probably buy around 10-20 and then sit on them or bail out if it does turn rotten. BFL even contacted me personally (the infamous Jody to some) to explain the reasons for the sale of chairs laptops etc on Craig's list. Seems they were just selling surplus stuff... Makes sense to me. Like clearing your basement out. The suspension of business must have put them back quite a lot but I'm sure they will survive in one form or another. I've not given up on them completely due to the handy refund. As I've said before BTC mining was always risky... and we all knew beforehand what we were buying into. Namely equipment in the development stage.
