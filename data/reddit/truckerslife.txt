For the record if you are Lower middle class and make a bank transfer like this your bank notifies the FBI and IRS.
They investigate and if you can show where it came from they let it go.

For years a friend of mine had started a system that bought 50 a week of bitcoin.  No one knew not even his wife.  
A few days before it dropped he sold out.  Everything he owned was payed off same day.   Now him and his wife are dumping everything they make into a retirement account and in 6 months they are semi retiring. In 2 years they are fully retiring.
He didn’t brag about his investments.
I’m one 5 people who know about the sale.  One reason he’s waiting 6 months to retire is so he can prepare people with a cover story of oh this has always been the plan.  “Yep lots of years of good investments into a retirement account.  So we are only going to be working a couple months out of the year.  “
In reality his hidden bank account has like 7 or 8 digits.
Be like *Tom don’t be a dick and brag about your success.
* not his real name.

She was under investigation for mishandling classified material.  Which if charged falls into laws that are listed as acts of treason.
That means she was being investigated for acts of treason.
This is where the media you pursued failed you.

That's why I said she was being investigated

He got 2 years for mishandling classified material during a time of war.  It falls under acts of treason.  He was a good guy but he did email secured information to an unsecured server.

1/2 of the businesses money came from standard sales
The other 1/2 of the business came from acting as a broker/guaranteer for individuals.  
@_date: 2017-01-18 22:58:13
It's considered classified.  And mishandling classified materials during a time of war opens you up to treason charges.

There wasn't anything I could do.
I attended 10 trials over similar things.  And it pisses me off so badly that they act like they had nothing they could charge her with.   A little over 1000 military and civilian contractors go to jail every year over similar offenses 
@_date: 2017-01-18 09:07:00
She handled classified documents in an insecure manner, 13000 times.  That law has been used to put several people in jail (as acts of treason) for far less important things like emailing the dates and times of a guys own physical training schedule from his military computer to his personal email address.
But she didn't get charged because of who she was.  
But either way the law she was being investigated for breaking was a law that falls under acts of treason.  That is a real issue.  And media outlets down playing that to voters is a horrible act of bias.
And I don't see how her not understanding how to handle secrets in a secure manner shouldn't be a topic of debate in a presidential election where every single thing she is told is a matter of national security.  
But i think trump is a worthless sack of shit that needed to have his shit brought to light as well.
The problem with biased reporting is even if you don't realize it they loose all credibility by downplaying one.
If they had openly had reporters going after unbiased stories of both I think neither candidate would have even made it into the general election.  And after the scandal of the DNC rigging the primaries Hilary should have been considered a non entity anyway.

There are companies that handle things like this for a 10% cut.
When I was in California a friend of mine worked at a coin collection store.   Facilitating and guaranteeing an item was around 1/2 of their business.  The store accepted the coin.  Verified it.  Then the buyer would wire transfer the money to them.  Once everything was done on that side the store would do an insured mailing or on really high dollar item my friend would have it locked in a brief case and hand deliver it.  They made enough that they had an employee whose sole job was to hand deliver coins.  
Well I say coins they also did stamps and similar items.  
His first day on the job they flew him from Southern California to NYC with a coin that was worth enough that they had 4 people with locked brief cases and no one knew who had the real coin.  When they arrived and got to the bank where they were delivering all the cases were opened to get the coin. 
I haven't talked to him in years but he used to love his job.  They got him certified to grade coins and such as well.  But his main job was to fly unassumingly to a location and hand off expensive items.

I do think they should have charged her because she was mishandling high level classified material.
Trevor and others are mishandling information that barely has a classification standard.
@_date: 2017-01-18 22:40:15
The person I was talking about has the first name of Trevor and was in jail.  I was at his trial because I was the one who gave him his security brief.  He got 2 years and can never work for a company with government contracts nor can he ever hold a clearance of any kind.

I know a guy that his great grandfather had been given stock in ford back in the 50s it was something like 50
Shares or something.
So here's the story.
GGrandfather retired from ford.  No clue what he did but it was some manager position.
Anyway he decided that he would hold on to them and give them to his grandson.  Bought a safety deposit box and set up things with a lawyer.
The lawyer had tons of paperwork in his office in a safe.
He died in the process of turning his practice over within a few weeks or a couple months of ggfather dying.  It was a customer that kinda fell to the wayside.  Safe sat in his office until late 80s early 90s and lawyer decided to pay to have it opened to see what was in it. (It contained a few wills and with ggfathers will was the stock certificates.
It took close to 10 years for the stocks to be certified as real and ford lawyers to step in
Early 2000s ford made a buy out offer for the stocks that was near real market value.  They set up trust funds for many family members and set up pay outs every year.  (Ford didn't want the stocks to be put back into the market flaw and bought it out to keep them from screwing with stock price. )
I always thought this was fairly cool story.  And it's actually true.  Some writers actually wrote a movie based on it when it happened.  Lots of shit got changed but the family got a little money because the script started out based on it.  The movie is changed to stock in a plane company.  And it doesn't go into the shit it took to get the stocks listed as real.

They can also slant a readers opinion of a topic by the way they present something.  For instance.  Hilary Clinton was under investigation for treason and many media outlets downplayed how serious the investigation was and made it out as an attack on her character rather than a flaw in her character.

I've said before that if visa and/or MasterCard allowed you to transfer x btc into a wallet that they could draw out of that btc would blow up as a commonly used currency... and the first one that set it up for use would suddenly have half a billion "secured" cards.  
Already if you have a card and you travel they will automatically do currency conversions.  So there is no major difference.  
And already when you swipe they check your balance to verify if you can make a purchase.  Swipe verify x amount of btc is in the wallet.  Authorize and withdraw from the wallet.  Done and done.

I'm saying that the average person needs something super fucking simple.  And people won't adopt things before it's it's so simple that it's hard to fuck up.  There are businesses in the US that still don't use credit cards because plugging a machine into the wall is to complicated.  I had less issues using my credit card in the Middle East in the middle of no where than I do in many rural areas in many states.  And I'm a truck driver I've been to all 48 continental states.  And I've had issues in many of them. 
I was in a rural gas station in California around 6-8 months ago and a guy told me he believed credit cards were a fad. Soon people would just go back to cash because it was the easiest.  
That's on the extreme end.  But for people a few steps above it they have no idea what BTC is and until it just functions as easy as anything else in their life they aren't going to use it.  And a few steps above those people.  They think only drug dealers use it.  It's about 5,000 steps from that point to being actually a viable currency for the vast majority of people.
The first step to making it a thing is something like visa adopting it.  Then someone can set something up where you just scan a printed out code for easy use.  But the average person is scared of it at the moment.

A friend of mine has been buying 50 in bitcoin a week since it was around 8¢ a coin.  He had a thing set up so that his bank automatically transferred money into an account that automatically bought the coin.  
When it was way way up he looked at the price.  Told his wife what he had been doing she was pissed until he told her what it was worth now.  Now they and their families all live on around a 2500 acre farm everyone has a big ass house of their own out in the woods.
I don’t know how much he had or what he got out of it.  But he sold well before it peaked.  Some guy was like man your crazy for selling that early.  And he looks back at his brand new truck and house... when he was working for barely minimum wage renting a shitty apartment driving a car that was more wishes and prayers than sheet metal.  
He considered bit coin a retirement fund.  And he went without lunch and shit just so he could afford to buy the coin every week.  Now... he’s never going to work again and his kids have private tutors prepping them for college.

Most places and people don't have the knowledge to make use of Scanables for funds transfer.

What's funnier is I know 2 guys that were heavy into bitcoin early on.  One guy when it was 50 cents sold 100 coins to get 50 bucks off amazon.  The other guy kept buying and buying when one of the auto buy things popped up he set it up to take about 12 a week out of his account and auto buy.  He had his computer set up to mine anytime the screen saver was up.  Didn't think about it.  Flash forward to when it was like 12 grand per... his wife was like what is this 12 a week coming out of your checking account he's like oh shit I had forgotten about that first I need to check a couple things..... hey honey...
I don't know how many he had but they sold them all paid off everything bought a 200 acre farm with a 10 acre lake...and he drives a brand new ford truck and she has a Land Rover.  So I'm guessing at least 2-3.
@_date: 2019-10-21 13:45:20

Honestly I'd like to use bitcoin more but currently it's not that convenient for day to day stuff.  
Someone needs to make a Brit coin account card where you can swipe it and it automatically converts into local currency and comes out of your account.  I don't care if you swipe and the transfer is made with usd or what.  I think having the ability to use it like a debit card would get a whole lot more people on board with using it as a primary currency.

If you have your seed code written down.
Advance all the letters and numbers by 1 
-Z becomes A
-9 becomes 0 then 1 
It's an easy to remember cipher and it's not going to get detected easily.
But you can add any number you want to it.
If you want to get more impressive.
Say you have a 9 digit sequence .
Then you follow the above formula for each letter the first gets shifted one letter while the 9th gets shifted 9 letters

A guy I know years ago started buying coins when they were like .25 or something.  He set up an auto buy script and had it running for years.  Every week $25 from his check went to the box where the script could use it.
When BTC was like 10 g he was having hard times paying the bills and was like huh I had forgot about this wonder if they are worth anything... HOLY SHIT.  Sold out a few days later.  Think he had something like 1-2 m
It was enough that he paid off his bills and him and his wife opened a small business.  
Edit Addition
Yes.  There are people who say he should have held out longer.  But he was in a dead end job.  And was needing some money.  He thought they might have come up to a couple dollars each.
