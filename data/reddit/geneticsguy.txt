I mean, did Trump mandate all GOP Congressmen have the same position on him on Bitcoin so now having a different opinion on it is defying Trump?
Wtf are these garbage clickbait headlines?

I hear ya man. On a positive note, that 1 that you have will be worth 100k one day, and you will likely have more than 1 by then as well because you are buying in a little bit each month as it is now, right? :)

Little things... like I remember her once saying, "If I was married to someone, there is no way I could ever get divorced from them unless they were making $400k per year or else the alimony wouldn't be worth it."
The young, naive, idiot me thought to myself, "Haha that's a silly thing to say! Well, I doubt I'll be making that much so this is a non-issue to even think about!" Ya, I was young and dumb.

People are freaking out because they mortgaged their house when Bitcoin was 15k.
@_date: 2017-12-17 07:01:30
Honestly, it's hard to deny this isn't just a huge speculation bubble. But, the higher and higher it goes, when it does re-correct, the more something like 15k seems like a good deal and the price normalizes. If it crashes tomorrow from 19k, then 19k will seem way overpriced and it might stabilize at 3-5k, but 5k people will think they are getting a great deal, even with the crash. If it keeps the bull run to 40k, let's say, then has a hard crash, hanging around 10-15kish will seem "normal" and a good deal.
Keep the hype. The higher the better.

The anti-Alienware circle jerk is kind of old.  While I personally would never buy one because I build my own gaming PC and find gaming laptops impractical, the Alienware is still an extremely well built and robust system.  Yes, it is above the avg price for the same hardware with its competitors, but if a person really is looking for a system they know is going to be a well built gaming laptop, you can't go wrong with Alienware.  
Some people also just really want the flare, the image.  It's no different than the people that pay the premium for the Macs.  As a bitcoin early adopter myself (though I wish earlier!!! roughly $1 p/coin when I bought in), the fact that I can spend them directly to a big company like Dell makes me actually consider getting an Alienware, just because it's something nice to spend it on!

I actually really don't like the term of "Bitcoin price bubble."  Seriously, do you just want another bubble that can pop?  Or, do you want something to actually gain real value.
If the institutional infrastructure to digital currency trade was more established there absolutely would be more investors and more people interested in the currency.  Real value of it would go up.
I hate the talk of of bubbles...  You can make money on a bubble, but a bubble just means artificially inflated value.  You don't get excited about a bubble unless you are a person that is controlling the recent pump and dump scheme.  This is not good press and a poor choice of words for trying to get people excited about a Bitcoin price increase.
@_date: 2014-07-18 17:18:17
This is really the biggest thing.  In the next few years, many many companies are going to be jumping onto the Bitcoin bandwagon, and all it is going to do is spread Bitcoin around into more hands.  This is good for all digital currencies.
@_date: 2014-04-08 15:15:38
I think that's a fair point.  Long-term investors don't enjoy the term bubble though.  Stability is very important and there is no reason to get excited about a "bubble" unless you are just planning to dump your coin during it.

While I agree things need to go further with Bitcoin, this is a revolutionary concept that makes evolutionary changes, step by step.  You can't jump straight to home plate, you gotta step on 1st, 2nd and 3rd first.  Getting massive acceptance to be used as a currency, commodity, or median of exchange is one of those bases.  The more businesses, especially large businesses, that pickup the Bitcoin banner, the more likely things are going to happen.
I don't think Bitcoin customers getting better discounts or special treatment is really the key to Bitcoin becoming more successful though.    This more just a shoutout to the bitcoin whales to spend money on them too.

While I think this is great news overall, it also brings into question that the crypto world has never really resolved... consumer protection.
I only bring this up cause DISH Network is one of the worst rated companies in the US well-known for fudging bills and so on.  Where is the recourse if one day say, you send them the necessary bitcoin and they say they never got it.  Yes, you could just verify it on the blockchain that they did, but what I am saying is that there is no real consumer protection here.
I think that right there is the big hurdle that needs to be dealt with one day for a digital currency to ever start puncturing the mainstream and working.
@_date: 2014-07-18 17:23:39
Ya, the price premium is a lot, but it is an incredibly well built system.  At least you know you are not buying something crap.  The way I look at it is it is like the Mac.  You can get an alternative well-built option cheaper, but if you buy it, it's not like you can go wrong with the device in that choice.  And, often people want the "image" of it too.  As a graduate student in a university, I can say that having a Mac is a massive image thing for girls right now, where it is almost a shame in some circles NOT to have one.  It is a status symbol of elite culture in a way.  Alienware is an image thing as well.  Some gamers want that image.  I can particulary say among the Chinese students at my university, which is like 50% of the entire graduate body here, tons of them have Alienware as it is considered a very prestigious laptop among them.  And you know what, having carried them, felt them, played with them, I can't deny they are impressive pieces of hardware.
But as a stingy ass guy, I still like the "more bang for my buck" approach, even though I have the money to buy lol

Haha if only I could say millions. I made the mistake of rather than being a "holder" I kept spending it every time it spiked. I bought tons of stuff off Dell over the years. For some reason I am running a 84TB plex media server in my home with about 12TB used, but hey, there was that great deal on HDDs that one time! lol
I am down to just over 15 coins now, when I used to have hundreds and I am a "holder" now. I am trying to not miss the Ethereum wave this time around. So far so good XD, but Bitcoin is my first love lol

Seems like the point is moot, however, considering how cheap storage space is getting... I mean, next year we are getting 16TB drives, and Seagate says 20TB+ the year after. 5 years from now who knows what's on the forefront.

True story... Literally this exact thing happened to me, but not in the context of bitcoin. I have an ex, started dating after I came back from a Mormon mission for a couple years in South Africa, so I was 22 years old at the time. We even got engaged after about 10 months of dating. Then, 2 months into the engagement, she cheats on me and says, "I just want someone with more ambition I guess. You're just a programmer. Sorry." Knowing her, what this really meant was she thought I was too much of a computer geek, my Computer Science degree I was enrolled in (and molecular and cellular biology double major) was not going to make as much money as a "business" guy, of what she kept telling me I should really be doing.
Well that was it. Queue some years later, I finish grad school, I am working solidly in computational biology, I'm published, I'm making 6 figures, and my position at my company is Chief Technology Officer (CTO) on my LinkedIn, and she messages me saying BS like we should catch up, she's in town, she'd love to see me and then trying to throw in little memories of old times. Note, I am married now with kids and she is married with a kid, and she hasn't talked to me in years but has the balls to say and I quote, roughly, "Things are pretty rough. [Name of husband] and I haven't been getting along, and he got diagnosed with cancer and I have been having a hard time with it. He doesn't seem interested in going for promotions anymore at work. I am so impressed with how well you are doing. You are so smart and funny. Want to catch up? You can call me at [X] time as my husband won't be home then."
Somehow she thought that would make me want to call her lol. Ya, I did not ever meet up with her since, nor did I care to, and she has reached out at least half a dozen times over the last few years. Oh and ya, she doesn't work and doesn't like working. My wife now complains that she doesn't work enough, even though she could stay at home. Who sounds like the person I'd rather be with? lol
It's amazing how many "old friends" reach out to you when they find out you are having success.

Haha exactly. I am not a child anymore. It's funny how looking back all the red flags were there in the relationship, but let me tell you, you are restricted from dating for the time you are a missionary. You can even be sent home early for inappropriate relations with a girl, which means literally you cannot talk to another girl on the phone. It is just against the rules. Well, when I came back to the US, she was my first serious relationship and it accelerated fast so I ignored all the red flags. My family is pretty well-off, so I think that is what made me initially interesting to her, in looking back at it.

Haha I know, you are right. To get into it more seriously, he has Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma, which is a cancer that has fairly long-term survival, but it still has complications. 5 year survival rate is high, at 63%, and 10 year is still around 50%, and treatments are getting better. But, there are some side-effects of course, like fatigue and so on.
I know what I'd want to do if I had risk of only having 5-10 years left with my family, I'd probably take it a bit easier too and spend time with my kids as much as possible, and the last thing I'd want is a wife complaining I wasn't aiming for the next step on the corporate ladder. I feel bad for the guy honestly.

@_date: 2018-03-15 17:14:24
This is not really true. You need capital to create product to sell. If you cannot get a loan so you can create your product to sell, you cannot produce. A good example is what if you had a landscaping company. You need $15,000 to buy a small truck to carry landscaping equipment. Your monthly payment will be $350 per month, let's say. Well, you just need 1 contract to cover that expense. Well, without a truck you have ZERO contracts to carry out your work. But, if you can't get the loan of $15k to buy the vehicle, you have no business.
The same is for pretty much ALL small businesses. The banks loan the money assuming your business will be successful. The funny thing is companies like NIKE wouldn't even exist today if it wasn't for them being able to get banks to give them money to buy their shoes imported from a Japanese factory (back in the 60s), then they would have never been able create their brand, their unqiue shoe designs, and go from a small business to a big business. But, they had investors that believed in them, backed them, and they were able to pay for their inventory to sell.
The modern rules on lending that same company would not be able to startup anymore because the banks are no longer legally allowed to lend them money.
@_date: 2018-03-15 05:05:59
To be fair, the went so hardcore in regulations that they made it almost impossible for banks to lend money into people. Even if a bank liked a person's investment idea, or business, they made it essentially against the law to loan them money unless the had X DTI ratio. So many small businesses are unable to get off the ground these days, not because the banks don't want to help them, but because they legally are no longer able to.
In other words, we had a housing crisis due to subprime lending, and dishonest practices where they mixed horrible bank notes in with AAA rated bank notes and repackaged them for investors, and a host of other issues, and they went so far overboard that they basically restricted lending completely to being no longer a Capitalistic venture, where the bank can take the risk and give someone money, to be 100% government regulated. Only the people flush with cash would be able to grow their business.
Something really does need to change in the financial industry because they did go far too overboard on things completely unrelated to the financial crisis, whilst ignoring many other things they should have, all the while giving taxpayer money to these multi-billion dollar banks.
Good job Bush and Obama!

I mean, if you think he doesn't care about profits, that is just naive. He KNOWS profits are important. He knows that a business cannot succeed without profits. He knows he can't get to Mars without profits. He knows he can't build his dream mega-rocket that can send 100 people to Mars without profits.
It's just that he has a passion for Space exploration and it is probably larger than his passion for profits. But, I assure he, he has some passion for profits too. It's one of the reasons why SpaceX likely will be financially stable and solvent one day... the cost of launching stuff into space is going to be extremely affordable and he is going to make a shit-load of money because of it.

Ah yes, no foresight, that's why he bought a 10% stake in Facebook back in the day, because he just got lucky with Paypal and screwed over Musk.
Who the hell cares what his politics are? He is a supply-side economic capitalist. A lot of those people are not huge Democrat fans, who lean more towards Keynesian economics, if not outright socialism. Yet, you want to criticize him as being an idiot because he chose to support the guy running for President that was going to cut taxes, something that him, a Libertarian, agrees with.
 Please, keep politics out of this thread. It has no place as this has literally nothing to do with politics.

Dev here. I left the toxicity of the startup world myself and couldn't be happier. Unless it's your own company, your own baby you are growing, the 60-80+ hr weeks just aren't worth it. If you are a good programmer you can easily land a job at 100-120k+ nowadays, minimum. No need to suffer for some pitiful 5% piece of the company, or insider shares that are worth nothing now with hopes to be worth more one day, at the expense of your livelihood and your family and your social life. 
The trick is to aim for the company that is slightly above startup stage, thus you have a good opportunity for growth in the company. They are growing but aren't too big and entrenched yet. Avoid companies that are absolutely NOT startups, that want developers to act like you are in a startup environment. Avoid those companies like the plague.
Plenty out there to choose from.

As a long time digital currency trader, this is pretty much exactly how it works. 10k is a psychological barrier. You hit 10.5, you're gonna rally to 15 because all of that hesitancy is building up... you break it the fear goes away and the money comes flying in and then all the rest as people try to ride the wave.
Downside about currency trading is the sleep you lose because you keep yourself constantly notified of any changes that happen as you sleep too lol

He is not even a conservative. He's a fairly "liberal" person, he's just not a leftist. He doesn't believe in regulating speech and he hates the dishonesty of political correctness. The *Fake News* about Jordan Peterson is that he is some right-wing fringe conservative. He just became outspoken when Canada tried to make it a crime to mis-gender a person.
