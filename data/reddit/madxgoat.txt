I can't lose if I don't sell long as the market recovers lol

This crash has turned my investments into a long term hold scenario because its going to take a year to climb back up where I can break even lol
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:42:35
I will see you at the ground brother 
@_date: 2018-01-16 09:45:10

@_date: 2018-01-16 09:36:23
This is my emotions precisely
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:53:45
I did buy some on the dip but only a little more I can't afford to put too much more in right now so maybe it was a 1.5 down instead of a double down yeah so by April I could be a financial genius or made the biggest financial mistake of my life its gambling at this point 
@_date: 2018-01-16 10:26:24
Idk end of the world north Korean nukes who knows hopefully its a nice profit on my investments but that's just me wanting to be optimistic
@_date: 2018-01-16 09:41:31
I'm going to take a pretty nasty hit if this goes badly I might have to hold until 2018 to break even 
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:47:48
Well dam this shit is guna ruin lives
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:32:15
I haven't sold probably should I want to bounce  back but god dam I've already lost so much money
@_date: 2018-01-11 08:15:23
I been waiting for the next mini bubble and I thought the rise up to 17 was it so I dropped a nice sum only to see it plummet shortly after man that was stupid 
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:22:20

@_date: 2018-01-18 06:48:14

My first buy is almost double in value too maybe I should have bought more haha
@_date: 2017-11-22 12:38:41
I probably need to do a ton of research on the whole thing. I see why they wanted to increase the block size. But I also see that stealing bitcoins  name is pretty low move I was thinking about trading there to try and make a Buck but holding my bitcoin
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:11:34
I bought low 8,000
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:59:47
Hogs can easily go for a couple hundred dollars can't afford that shit in this market lol
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:22:39
Sell lol idk I'm already down so much that my only hope is to hold until bottom and hope things improve if not ehh oh well money isn't everything I didn't invest enough to ruin my life doesn't mean I want to lose all that money tho quite a wild ride
@_date: 2018-02-02 00:42:32
Lol idk why but pre planned panic sell made me laugh I mean that is exactly what it is 
@_date: 2018-02-10 15:10:57
Dont try to catch a falling knife by holding ......caught it bitch 
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:07:13
Woo get ready for under 7k bitcoin bois
@_date: 2018-02-15 10:54:59
Still waiting on that Gemini verification been months
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:25:33
I thought about it but I'm in for long haul anyway I think the time for that would have been about when bitcoin was floating around 12k now the only way to not lose a majority of my money would be to hold on and hope of course means risking all the coins I'm holding that I have left 
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:46:09
About 900 USD I'm a small fry 
@_date: 2018-04-25 15:57:51
I bought at 17k so this is still quite a dip for me I planned on holding for all of 2018 anyway
