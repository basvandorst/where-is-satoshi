Eh. I'm up $20 over the last week.  Yesterday was brutal.  Left work up 80, got home up 20. Should have sold before I left but was in a hurry and a bit greedy. 
It appears to be bottoming out btw. Oversold on the 15 m rsi and trending bullish, stoch rsi has it close to overbought. We are going to bounce around in the mid 10800 - 10900s today.  Buy and sell fractional - you might make $5 per thousand risked, and on volatile days you can make that several times over.
Now, someone can come dump on you, don't be lazy like me and leave yourself exposed for an hour. Don't risk a lot, and you can't lose a lot. Can't make a lot either,  but the point is to make a little at a time. Don't risk your profits either. Don't panic - buy and sell clear trends, and when the price ignores those trends limit losses and wait for it to level out. BTC is not an efficient market. You only need to make a few dollars at a time.
I'm in the middle of writing a bot so I can catch pennies rather than $ relying upon limit maker orders typed by hand, so my swings can be a bit more level and profits steadier.

Coinbase. The reason I switched to trading on gdax instead of in the app is that coinbase basically gives you the worst possible price.  It can be 15 - 20 dollars from market price, turning a profitable sell into a loss. After I lost $20 bucks on a supposedly profitable transaction, I switched.
But it does buys and sells through gdax. I think that's hand-waved away with slippage and fees, but it's super weird to say sell and see that you weren't even close to market price or the spread line in the book.
