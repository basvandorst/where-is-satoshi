Imagine those saying (Myself included!!) "Man, if only I got in when it was 10 bucks!".
We won't ever be there again, get over it! For me, saying "Man, I got in when only 1% of the people had their hands in it".
To me, that's good enough. If only I had enough to buy one coin.

This post genuinely scares me. I'm new and purchased too soon. Not at 17 or 16K, but up there. 14?
I slowly see the "HODL" posts evaporating...
Granted, this is not me advocating one or the other, but it is disturbing.

I got in at 17K. If I can have it go up to 17.3K, I can sell, spend it on the wife and sleep well!
Happy wife, happy life :)

Yes. The was no chance of a profit when you bought it at $4, and no chance of a profit now. TRUST ME. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:50:12
Agreed. The elitism in this community is disgusting. Why must we talk down the little people of this world?

What do you think it will go down to?

Absolutely mental to see how many people have 160 million in their bank accounts.

Well I do believe it will get there by mid 2018. However, I'm too uneducated on this for my opinion to hold any real weight.

Well I will tell you what, friend! If I lose this money, they will have to pick themselves up by their bootstraps and make money the way my grandfathers did before me!
You need to be smart in this day and age if you want a good life! Can't just go around gambling with money !

Yeah it's not good, but I can't help but feel like a lot of these people are writing this articles out of anger. They missed out  on big money, so now everyone included in this currency is an evil, earth destroying POS.

I don't buy bibcoins but best of luck 2 u :)
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:20:52
I think the reality is , is that
A. They really have NO idea what's happening and don't want to stir the pot even more.
B. The believe the currency is going to go so high after these dips, that it will essentially be negligible.

Well people are saying that it's going to go far past 20,000 by the end of 2017.

You realize that was only 2 days ago, right? 
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:50:50
The only one I agree with (And I don't even know you) is - 90% of texts and conversations with friends / family involves bitcoin.
That's something I would do and I have since stopped because it makes me cringe looking back in hindsight. Reality is - Most people don't care.
However, if it explodes again and makes you tons of money, I bet she will miraculously cultivate a "passion" for bitcoin !
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:56:34
Well first off man, I'm new to this and screwed up royally as well. I bought a small portion at 14K... and while it may have not been a lot, I only bought a small amount because that's all I could afford.
Don't let your friends be the deciding factor. They probably would have told you it was a scam when it was at $100 a coin too !!!
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:19:36
The thing that scares me about this is that people were probably saying this at 10K. "When it hits 9K again, I'll buy back"... but it hasn't gone back down.
I'm fairly ignorant to this BTC and new to it, but I think you get my point. What if this thing just keeps rising and you wish you would have just held? 
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:43:48
POOP- people order our patties 
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:27:36
What's the deal with "Vcash". You'll notice that usually the people recommending a coin that's unheard of usually have some type of stake in it, in one way or another. Perhaps they've mined the living shit out of it and it has no value so they'll hoping it will inflate? I don't know.
Have you heard of that ? "VCHASH"?

Yes! And to anyone that doubts your investments (like they did mine! I sold my mothers and mine, but that's okay, I got a great rate for our temporary stay at the Sheraton Inn), I just look at them and say "Hey, retard! WHAT'S THE WORST THAT COULD HAPPEN!?"
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:13:48
It's awesome to be excited about the tech, but just like the guy who posted on here and found 55 coins (Roughly 1 million bucks), he cared more about not having loans or debt, like most people.

@_date: 2017-12-11 19:17:03
Wow! 
I truly believe it will skyrocket once again. This is another chance to get on board. It's so hard to believe that people are saying it's still not worth it. I would understand if they were in the initial growth phases like when it hit 100+, but this is just proof man.

It's so tough to tell man. If it does get up to $100,000 a coin and you didn't invest, you're gonna feel like shit... If you invest and the coin plummets, you're gonna feel like shit...
Why not take out a small percentage instead of the entire thing?

Because $100 has the same value for everyone.

It's about damn time the political parties join together and agree on one thing. They all hate bitcoin lol. Fox news is shitting on it constantly./
