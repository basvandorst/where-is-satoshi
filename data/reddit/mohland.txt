Stop coming in here with your logic and reason! ;)

That's awesome. I'm a bitcoiner too btw, got friends that have kicked down the same ($50k-100k). :D
Is there a point to your rants are are you trying to just out-troll the rest? Because it's pretty cute. :D
@_date: 2014-04-17 11:47:15


If there's a takeaway from all of this, I'm pretty sure this is it. :)
@_date: 2014-04-07 05:17:17


I got username mentioned in this thread and got brought here. We'd love to have you on dogetipbot! :) Here, have some! +1000 doge 
Yeah -- we are (and always will be) 100% free and we actually pay for all the miner tx fees when you withdraw -- tips to dogetipbot pay for all those. Fees are fucking stupid (imho). :D
Regarding our data collection/privacy -- to us, all you are is a username/id number on reddit. :) Some of us choose to link our IRL identities to our online usernames... but that's our choice :)

Technically, bitcointip did it first. (Oct 2012). I didn't create dogetipbot until Dec 2013

Nah, it was legitimately bad. Cringeworthy bad.

I'm totally down to have some really awkward dinner parties in my future.
@_date: 2014-11-06 02:08:26
It is. We had this problem back in January, so I rewrote/limited the number of API calls we had to use and cached a lot of data. Nick's in the same boat now. :) 
Scaling up is fun. When you're processing 5000-10000 tips a day, it makes for some fun engineering challenges. :D 
@_date: 2014-01-20 02:42:38


Honestly? We work on it because of the userbase and the community. I haven't seen this type of support and interest outside of gaming circles (e.g. Mojang/Starbound/CCP). It's a pretty unique thing, especially for a crypto.
Technically speaking, the coin doesn't have any particular technological innovation to it, which is why I think a lot of people are upset. It's a luckycoin clone. :)
@_date: 2014-03-17 19:13:45
I don't have access to the Bitcoin data, but I can definitely pull the metrics on median/mean dogecoin tips via dogetipbot. :)
@_date: 2014-02-04 10:39:37
I'm assuming you also downvote altcointip when it shows up here too, right? :)
@_date: 2014-12-31 02:46:26
A more interesting question then becomes - if $5 is the sweet spot for registering an account... Then Why Bitcoin? Why not just send $5 Amazon gift cards?

Wait, we've got cages? Aww hell yeah! ;) 
@_date: 2014-12-31 02:52:08
Promoting BTC as a currency is one thing - gaining user adoption where it's immediately "cool now I can cash this out for real money" is another. I never liked USD/Fiat tip amounts, which is why I never put them into dogetipbot in the first place. ;) 
@_date: 2014-06-05 06:10:50
That's what I thought. weird. :P
btw when can you put up stats? :D the people demand it! hehe
@_date: 2014-12-31 02:22:58
In the Bitcoin world this may be true... I'd be curious to see accept rates based on dollar value via ChangeTip. 
On the dogetipbot side, Dollar value doesn't really factor in. I've seen $20 USD (ish, we don't do fiat values) tips go unclaimed, and far more 100-1000 doge tips get accepted. 
For Dogecoin, it's more of a "Yay! Dogecoin!" phenomenon rather than a "Yay! Internet Tokens I can convert into cash" sentiment. We're a weird lot though. :P

eeeeh... mohland (dogetipbot creator) here. this post title makes me cringe a little bit. :o
If folks are unhappy with the bitcointip-&gt;changetip arrangement, here supports BTC tips, and is a great dude. Plus, it's fully open source and on github.
Pleeeeease only use dogetipbot if you want to tip dogecoins. That's what we do. :)
@_date: 2014-04-04 10:21:06
Can confirm. Bryce is indeed an awesome dude. :)
@_date: 2014-06-05 07:58:42
Real life is silly. :) 
This is the Internet we're talking about. IRL people get made fun if for playing video games all day. On the internet, they get corporate sponsorships and broadcast on twitch. 
That's why I always say haters gonna hate, tippers gonna tip.

Nick and crew has his work cut out for him. It's not easy to run a bot that handles 5-10k tips a day. :)
Still, nice to see Bitcoin having some fun like us silly dogecoiners do. :D 
@_date: 2014-10-24 07:26:00
@_date: 2014-02-04 10:50:27
on reddit, dogetipbot behaves the same way bitcointip does. :P
you know you can tip bitcoins outside of here, right?
@_date: 2014-03-17 19:11:31
It definitely skews the figures a bit -- I based the data off the same methodology that NerdFighterSean did with this report:

Might have to take you up on that offer. :) 
@_date: 2014-03-17 19:13:00
Yup. Both our calculations were based on the price of BTC / DOGE at the time of the tip. 
@_date: 2014-02-03 09:36:16
That's awesome. :) 
@_date: 2014-03-18 11:35:26
Nope. Used price at the time of tipping on the dogetipbot side. :)

Never underestimate the power of silliness and fun. It goes a long way.

You may be thinking of ALTcointip (-- dogetipbot v1 was a fork of ALTcointip. It supports BTC and other altcoins.
I deal strictly in dogecoins -- not really interested in BTC tipping.

we require verify if you want dogetipbot to reply with a comment.
like this - +500 doge verify
@_date: 2014-11-07 02:13:02
Technically the dogetipbot transactions aren't free, we just pay the cost of the txs from tips to myself/dogetipbot :) 
@_date: 2014-11-04 07:12:28
Yup. Also thanks for your write ups for the others that couldn't make it. Lawsky's keynote yesterday was damn good.

@_date: 2014-03-17 22:41:44
yeah, that bot just scrapes public dogetipbot verify comments and it's relatively new. as the other poster noted, the 10mm tip was way back in December.
@_date: 2014-04-07 06:22:17
No prob! Anytime. :)
@_date: 2014-06-05 02:49:09
We (dogetipbot) are pretty open about sharing data for research purposes (last folks we gave tipping statistics to for all 500k tips were MIT students). :)
Reddit also did a full data dump for all dogetipbot comments ever for them so they could compare the # of tips that are verified vs non-verified (default behaviour is NOT to post comments). 
If folks ever want to start digging around in our data, just shoot me an email (mohland A lot of our data/stats will be live on the site in a few weeks too.
dogetipbot tips last 2 weeks have been down. Normal USD tips per day hovers between ~$1000-2000, but we did see a few $10k days in April (lolz). :)
@_date: 2014-05-17 03:14:42
They're a... Fanatical bunch :) &lt;3
@_date: 2014-04-03 03:53:10
No prob. :)
ye, those alt tipbots pop up like every week -- I don't think I've ever accepted one (even if they're using my code or im14's ALTcointip). Oh well, that's what happens when it's all open source. :D
@_date: 2014-02-04 11:13:25
Aye, same for dogetipbot and altcointip. Some mods/subs like having the bots around, others don't. :)
@_date: 2014-12-11 07:52:48
Except you can tip sats. That's never been the issue. :)

@_date: 2014-06-05 03:07:55
Aye, like I said, we've been down. Seems to happen at least once a month haha. :)
5/29 was our last day over $2k ($2227). 5/30 we dropped to $1668. Since then it's been between $500-1000.
I don't know how open Nick &amp; crew at ChangeTip are to opening up their data, but it never hurts to ask!

We've known since day 1 that the average bitcoin tip size is larger. :)
Our median tip amount is $0.027 USD btw. Hehe.
@_date: 2014-04-03 03:43:25
Here's a real one. +5000 doge verify
Once you're registered (via +accept / + register) you're in. After that, you'll get messages from dogetipbot about receiving tips for ~2 weeks, then it stops (we hit the reddit API limits real quick. 15k messages a day will do that). using the verify flag (ala bitcointip) makes some of these a bit more valid. Any tips over 1k verify automatically because fake tipping abounds.


Yup. Fucktards attempted to tip 4,470,154,524.48395890 as of now with insufficient funds. :) 
I do my best to stay on top of things. :D

It's a bit fun, knowing that we're constantly berated for our low volume tips, and yet have processed $200k usd in tips in 6 months. Hehe.

I was given my first bitcoin tip a month after launching dogetipbot. ;)

@_date: 2014-03-18 11:28:45
Aye, it is. :) bitcointip users tend to tip larger amounts and less frequently, and dogetipbot uers... well, my userbase is essentially the Zerg of cryptocurrency tippers ;)
When it comes down to it, a single $7 USD tip and 100 $0.07 tips are the same in my eyes. Not everyone around here sees things the same though. :)

It's actually not that hard to play by the rules. lulz. dogetipbot actually got popped in the first few weeks because the original altcointip/bitcointip source was breaking one of reddit's rules. I fixed it immediately and the admins were really thankful.

the original bot was upvoting comments when it was summoned (bots should never upvote). alienth sent me a message about it, and we patched it quickly.
apparently it had been doing it for a while, but didn't get noticed until dogetipbot blew up overnight. ;D

Not particularly, at least not like it was on reddit. It's a different world there, and that's a bit why we're retooling the platform so it meshes well with the UX that streamers/viewers are used to.


It has to be a win/win for both the creator and the fan. If there's any point of friction between the two, one or the other isn't going to like it.
As far as selling exclusive content goes, that's not something that's particularly on our agenda -- though we're not ruling it out. :) Cheers!

Median tip size is a better metric -- back when the infamous dogetipbot/bitcointip slide I created hit folks were clamoring for a median tip size, rather than the average.
Technically the average tip size for dogetipbot still remains about $0.30, while our mean is ~$0.027.
@_date: 2015-03-21 12:14:30
