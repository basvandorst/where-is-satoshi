You're right. FEAR is never a good or wise instinct to go off. I only got a dose of it when a trader friend of mine started to panic. Thanks for not being condescending.

Hold through out the drop? Hm. Why not just pull out - then rebuy? The only problem is to rebuy with Coinjar they add an extra 2k AUD on it so I would only get 7-8 back.

Would exchanging some to Etheruem be a good idea? In Exodus, for some reason you got like 1k more.

I don't either but I have transferred it to Coinjar so I could exchange it for Money in case shit goes balls up. I have no idea where this panic is coming from, should never have gone to 4chan biz.

Only asking for advice. I've done my research but I have gone through a lot of tragedy in my life, I can only do so much. I have a mother with PTSD to look after, dude. Just found out that if the whole Wall Street panic sell happens - price goes down and so does mine. I thought I could come here for advice.

Cheers. I'll look into a Vanguard index ETF, I don't know much about index funds could you give me a low down because I'm hoping to buy atleast 5 shares in FB, 5 in Netflix, then however much in Snapchat then the rest - which should be $3500 - $2500 in perhaps what u recc

And what if it doesn't? Should I still just wait?

I was thinking about 5, 3 is too low imo. I want to take care of my mum, she's gone through a lot in the next ten years. I'm also waiting for Snapchat to go public and investing in JB Hi Fi along with Qantas and some other shares, so that's about 10k altogether - with another 10k in savings, and put in 5000k which has gone up to nearly 9 in Apple.

I think Snapchat is a very short term investment. But one with some gains.
