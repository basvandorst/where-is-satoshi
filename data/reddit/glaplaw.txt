Pretty sure this wouldn't hold up (at least for telemarketing calls). Consent to receive robo telemarketing calls can't be required as a condition of service. And this also wouldn't count as "express written consent" which the TCPA requires. PayPal needs a new TCPA compliance lawyer.
That said, because of arbitration clause and class waiver, they'll never get sued for it in a way that matters. Thanks, Supreme Court.

Even if you could make this argument -- and I think you can -- how do you recover? A judgment is worth no more than the paper it's written on without a defendant who has money/will pay.

Limited consequences, from a civil legal standpoint. Maybe something criminal if the feds decide to get involved.
But civilly -- any money they stole is probably long hidden/spent/converted. You'd never see a dime of it.

What were the claims? Can someone find and post the complaint?

Lawyer up? I'm curious what your intent is.
Mt. Gox can't pay anything, even if you win a lawsuit. 
Or is it to CYA?

As a lawyer very interested in helping guard against unscrupulous business practices relating to bitcoin, particularly in its infancy, I believe I could make a very compelling argument that someone scammed out of bitcoins should recover the value of the bitcoins at the time of either suit or judgment.
You can get interest on damage awards. Bitcoin's appreciation should be equally recoverable, especially since it's readily ascertainable and far less speculative than interest.

Now we're starting to see one of the major downsides of Bitcoin.
I'm a lawyer. I would love to help people recover what was lost/mishandled/stolen from them. But, alas, with Bitcoin, this isn't feasible.

You're right, of course.
But Bitcoin (and other coins) make it easier.

Liability is only one half of the equation. No lawyer is going to pursue them when they can't pay.

This is so frustrating. Look, I don't own Bitcoin or any alt coins anymore, but I respect the hell out of the community for sticking with it and trying to make it happen on a mainstream level.
But at some point you have to recognize that some of the very things that make Bitcoin "great" -- namely the anonymity and ease of transfer -- are going to continue to hold Bitcoin back. Every time the word "scam" and "Bitcoin" get put together, it's one step closer to Bitcoin itself being associated with "scam." Regardless of the details of each independent scam. The mainstream public doesn't dive into details.
On top of that, this is frustrating because I want to help. I'm a lawyer. So many of these Bitcoin scams are ripe for class action lawsuits. But guess what? Because the anonymity and ease of transfer of Bitcoin, even if I could successfully prove that the scammer stole the Bitcoin, there'd be no way to track it down and get people's money back. 
And that leads to the paradox of altcoins from where I sit: until it becomes more easily traceable and more difficult to transfer, it will invite scammers, and bit by bit delegitimize altcoins. But getting rid of those two things defeats a lot of the point of altcoins.

How do you trace those coins into those assets? And getting at the principal of a company rather than the company itself is very difficult, unfortunately (or fortunately, depending on your perspective).
