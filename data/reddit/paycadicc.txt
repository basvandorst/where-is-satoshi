Hey I’m pretty new with bitcoin. I used it for purchases in the past, and I had a few hundred dollars left over. It’s increased in price and I’m wondering what to do? I’m using this for a trip about a month from now so I need to sell between now and mid July. What do u think? Sell now or wait till I’m leaving soon so it can potentially increase? 
I’m only asking bc you seem confident in your assessment and I barely know anything about btc let alone any crypto.

I have already profited about $200 however Id like to hold out if its worth it

I meant the big crash that happened a while ago. When it was at its highest point.

Lmaoo I bought at 23k. Crashed the next fucking day. Worst part is I bought it to purchase something almost immediately, however I had to wait a few days for problems on their ends and then... crash

Haha definitely. I didn’t even remember I had it till probably 6 months later

Ive had this bitcoin for about 6 months actually. I bought really high, then it crashed and I forgot about it for a while.

was asking for advice from people that been in this market

U right. I was upset to see the drop but I’m still definitely profiting from my initial so it’s not all bad
