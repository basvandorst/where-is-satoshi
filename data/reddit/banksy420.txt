One can argue the volunteer nodes with bitcoin could kill bitcoin itself. At least with DRK, Node operators get paid to operate them. People have invested in enough coins to run those masternodes, which helps ensure they have an invested interest, which makes the coin stronger.
DRK is the most well rounded coin out of all the coins that anyone has mentioned.

Such awesome news, Completely happy right now, and its not even my coin.
@_date: 2014-07-09 07:12:06
Good. wanna see what I carry around for pocket cash?
I got pulled over one time, the cop asked why I had so much cash in my center console. I told him "So much" is relative.
he didnt get it.

Dont judge an account by its age. Unless you like limiting yourself.

You arent serious are you? Blockchain bloat is a bigger problem in regards to adoption than anything I can think of.
No average user wants to have to keep doubling their available hard drive space just to transact.

Yeah, I hold many coins, and do a lot of transactions, all of which are completely legit... for now.
I truly wish I could see the presentation immediately though.
@_date: 2014-07-09 07:41:17
haha! Everytime I come around my choppa go ratatata hahahaha. nice video. anyways
Here you go... my play wallet... 1 of 5...

Yeah, I agree. However I would still like to be as prepared as possible. If I watch and its completely mind blowing, and I havent prepared, its going to suck.
For 100 different reasons. Anyone holding any type of coin will feel it one way or another, good or bad.
Bitcoin can shun the tor markets, refuse to acknowledge their importance, or try to distance itself from those markets all it wants, but the fact is, the tor markets are what fueled bitcoin in the beginning, and continues to do so on various levels.
BTC will drop a decent bit in regards to fiat, if this presentation is mind blowing. I can see people going in expecting one thing, and coming out pale.

You decided to put a PSA, warning against a coin, and you dont even know basic facts about the coin??
Its closed source until the entire process is stable.
See where we are at in 2 months time........
@_date: 2014-06-02 23:31:19
Do yourself a service and do in depth reading for 10 mins. If you dont get it by then, fine no on can blame you for how you feel. its obvious you havent done much research.
Others have dismissed it also, I can always tell who hasnt researched the coin. no one can blame anyone, I mean there are truly so many sh*tcoins, that even I stopped paying attention to anything other than btc, ltc for a while.
Those of you that get bent out of shape by it currently being closed source dont need to worry so much, that wont be a problem once its completely proofed.
@_date: 2014-06-03 02:39:08
Congratz for putting Darkcoin on the front page of the Bitcoin subreddit!!
Darkcoin thanks you for your service.
Now those that are weary about Darkcoin, or havent researched it, do yourself a service and spent a few minutes checking it out. You wont be sorry.
@_date: 2014-07-09 07:16:36
but we should narrow down the search
@_date: 2014-06-02 23:20:23
lol jeezus. Some people, and their fears... Masked as public service. The original post is a disservice to anyone that doesnt mind keeping an open mind, and possibly trading or investing in more than one coin.
Bitcoin wants to remain number 1 so bad... so bad.
Where are the psa's for most of the other coins??? lol The ACTUAL pump and dumps??
Surely you have offered this wonderful public service and created other psa's for most of the other coins, the ones that have ACTUALLY been scams or dont live up to their own hype... right???

"Coins are gone, here is your invoice for services rendered... See ya next month"

First of all, the fact that these types of posts have been showing up in just points to the fact that people are worried about what darkcoin means for bitcoin.
They use all types of arguments. From bashing the current closed source status, to the Myspace-Facebook Arguments which is "Why go elsewhere? Everything you need is riiight here.... Dont mind that Darkcoin thing, its just a fad"
To say darkcoin is just bitcoin with coinjoin is bullsh*t. Not even close.
To say darkcoin is not anon, okay someone go through the processes from a-z on how it isnt.
At this point you guys are just regurgitating "Instamine!, Not Anon!, Its Just bitcoin with coinjoin"
Yet, most of you saying that are just parroting something you read, from someone that made it up.
Bad information regurgitated, from what was originally false information.
BTW. I have a sh*t load of both btc AND drk. So far Im liking the drk community and mentality more. Seems the bitcoin community has made the transition from early adopters and early believers to slick bitcoin foundation types, manipulating types, and wall street types, who would sell their own mothers for a spike in the market.
Bitcoin stopped being bitcoin a long time ago. Its only a matter of time before it gets myspaced out of the equation entirely. That isnt an endorsement for DRK, or even a prediction that it would be drk to do it. But bitcoin will eventually fall and its for many reasons other than just a better coin being created.

I hold btc, drk and a very small amount of ltc. I try to use drk as much as possible in order to help support the coin. Not because of what it does now, but also what it is GOING to do. For those who just invest vs transact with cryptocurrency, well consider this a prime time to get a few DRK and get another shot at the btc style craze when DRK starts getting adopted by more and more people...
Put as much protection as you can in place. Dont just rely on one thing to keep your transactions safe.

Thats not what happened, they simply created another wallet.dat file in order to "clean" up some of the old addresses from the old wallets. After 10's of thousands of users, the wallet is bound to get filled with so much data, a new wallet.dat file is required.
