If my wallet supports bech32 and P2SH, will my private key be able to generate those addresses? Or will I need a new seed and key and move my coins over to the new one?

There needs to be a subreddit for bitcoin memes and stories and one for actual discussion of dev and announcements etc.

This is my life. Constantly finding random things whenever I move or check weird spots. A couple times I've lost, found, then relost when I hide it again. I've had a battle with a few items over several years where I'll find it and lose it once a year. Minding like finding $5 in the wash but on a bigger scale

Using that logic at what point would you actually think it's at it's low and should buy?
There's no way to tell when it'll stabilize and head up. So you could take the chance and buy now or take the chance of buying later. But if you just keep waiting then all of a sudden it's shooting back up and you're on a mound of regrets. I think it's smart to put in several little amounts at any time. That way even if you miss the lowest you still got in on the downhill.

Too lazy to look that up. But from my experience the general case is that the less money you or your family has the more likely you are to have the newest phone or flashy merchandise. Whereas the richer people I know (who aren't like riiiich but they're definitely more than a couple steps above the general population) all would rather save it and spend it on eating healthy or hobbies and passions or something that will have a return. 
My families probably pretty in the middle. My dad jumps at opportunities to ski and take an amazing vacation and will spend extra to get into a diet or something. But as soon as I ask for a new phone it was "I'm not paying for that so figure it out" and "you better put a case on your 5 year old phone cuz I'll break you if you break it" I'm definitely not complaining thought because I've learned a lot through that and am glad I don't put myself in money struggles buying useless shit that I'll throw away when a better one comes around.

Was about to call quits Friday and sell out and buy some stuff I could really use but that aren't necessities. Then I missed out and it's even lower now. So now I'm kinda hoping I got saved by indecision and it comes up soon. My investments were with money I could lose though. So you're smart if you were able to get out even with whatever you had.

This made me laugh and shed a tear at the same time
