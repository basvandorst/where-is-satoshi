If you have a miner buddy and he has a heart for this low fee, this is definitely the fastest and cheapest way to go ;)

Wow that's even better news, I dind't know that! Thank you so much for telling me this :)
Now I have to find a guide on how to properly claim my BCH. If I understood correctly, I can still claim the BCH even though I already spent some of my BCT? I'm a bit nervous though to fuck something up during the process or to insert my private keys into another software and getting both stolen (my BCT and my BCH). After forgetting my PW and reading a lot about BCT, I became a bit paranoid.

If you really want to get the transaction going and if it's worth it, pay the guys from 
I googled it for days and nothing worked for me but this service.
I did the same some days ago and it worked like a charm.
good luck!

The simple answer is: No BUT
I had an issue with a stuck transaction as my core wallet was set up with the wrong fees. I googled about 2 days straight on this issue and came to the conclusion that the only promising service is  (the one you mentioned with the high fee) .
I ended up using their service as my fee was so low that I could have waited for months for the transaction to proceed. From transfering the 75$ to get my transaction through it took 2 days (1 probably for the money to arrive). 
So I can recommend their service, it is no scam. All the articles I read said that this platform is reliable - and it is.
Use it and you wil be happy, if it makes sense for you to pay this "high" fee.
tl;dr:  is the only way to really get your stuck transaction through IMO
Good luck &amp; cheers

Well this is not about being right or wrong. It's about having a vision or being stuck with conservative mechanisms.

Did you ever get something from the internet for free? Every free accelerator is not working or a scam (except viabtc which didn't work for me even though I tried every hour).
If you want your transaction to be proceeded and it's worth it, you should take the 60 bucks. If not, you could wait months or years for the transaction.

Thanks! Yes I don't consider it as a loss even when it "crashes" as I find the idea very interesting and I heard a lot that you should never cash out completely, especially with BTC. That's why I convinced them in the end.
Yep, Christmas, the good oldfashioned traditional currency eater. I was happry to forward the money to them, no blame included :D

Do you mean Bitcoin QT? When did you start mining and did you import your old wallet.dat to the correct datadir?! 
If yes you have to wait, until Bitcoin Core synched up at least until it synched "your mining". To fully synch the whole blockchain the ETA depends on your hardware. It can take days up to weeks.
Otherwise you can try another lite wallet but take care not to lose the BTC during this process.

Thanks mate!
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:18:34
If you did not reinstall anything and use your old wallet, it will definitely show up as soon as the synch process surpassed your "mining dates" - well if you ever transferred the BTC to your Bitcoin QT wallet?
@_date: 2017-12-15 14:44:05
It is not that difficult actually. 
1. Do you have your old wallet.dat when you first started mining? If no, your BTC are lost if you didn't transfer them to an online wallet or other wallet at all.
2. If you still have the old wallet.dat, you should be fine.
3. If you just reinstalled Bitcoin QT (now = Bitcoin Core), of course your balance is 0 if you didn't import your old wallet file. 
Provide is with the information we need, otherwise we can't help you.

Yes the fees are going up but that's the game. I am quite sure that 35 sat/b is not enough to get your transaction through in 16 hours. It is just an ETA. With this fee, it could take weeks or months to proceed, trust me. 
You can find the ETA on the right side of the homepage I provided under the section "Delay/Time".
If it's worth your transaction, you should definitely fee bump, even though $ 35 is too much as the current fee according to bitcoinfees is 0.0009266 = ~ 16 USD.
Good luck

Yep, won't happen again :) Thanks for the advice!
@_date: 2017-12-15 13:27:51
You can check the current optimal fees here: 
35 sat/b is way too low as the current optimal fee is pending between 400 - 420 sat/b.
The ETA of a transaction with 35 sat/b currently is 30-960 min. Do you have the possibility to fee bump your transaction? If yes, you definitely should.

Glad it worked out, cheers mate :-)
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:58:40
Do I? 
@_date: 2017-12-15 14:08:08
Your fee was 95.442 sat/B - You can check the optimal fees here: 
Currently it's 400-420 sat/B, so your fee is quite low. For your fee range 81-90 sat/B the ETA = 20 - 960 min, though your fee is not ridiculously low, it could be even go through faster than expected. 
I have no experience with fee bumping on multibit (I don't think it's possible, is it?). Theoretically you should be able to fee bump with electrum, but I don't know if it is possible when the transaction is already made!
You will have to google this information yourself. As an alternative you can try using  (every hour there are 100 slots, so you have to be quick) or  (you will have to pay 50 - 80$).
Good luck!

It always helps to provide the transaction (e.g. from blockchain.info). The transaction eventually will go through but did you check the current network fees before makeing the transaction?
You can try Fee bumping - which wallet did you use for it (Core, Electrum)? You have to provide more information on this topic, otherwise it is really hard to give support.
