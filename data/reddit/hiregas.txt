I googled everything about zellepay and it said once the payment is made, it cannot be cancelled. So i figure out it is workable
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:36:09
Anyone with experience of selling here?
@_date: 2017-12-06 07:11:31
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:05:40
I was not
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:10:47
What u mean. This was done online
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:26:45
That is what i am saying. The money went throught as my email is registered in zellepay
@_date: 2017-12-06 07:11:56

@_date: 2017-12-08 02:39:00
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:17:06
So what are u saying is the buyer scammed me? All i could think is he sent me $1995 via zellepay and the i release 0.1 btc into his acc on localbitcoin. That is his term.

Exactly, the highest recorded was about 4500 and it was last week. Since then, it bounces between 4000 and 4200
