Yup. It's the classic, cookie-cutter, run-of-the-mill type of unique, ground-breaking, economic revolution.

Dude, imagine like, if someone watches Rick and Morty AND bought bitcoin? They would be like, so smart... smart enough to be the president.

I've seen the same story being posted about 4 times an hour all morning long. I don't get it myself. It's a big win for Wal-mart, but how does it effect the Bitcoin market?

I don't care about bitcoin. I don't care about money, crypto-currency, stocks or markets.

I imagine some near suicidal, broke, destitute day trader listening to this, becoming happy and motivated, then turns things around with some killer trades and goes all Wolf of Wallstreet on everyone.

Don't worry guys, I'm on it.
