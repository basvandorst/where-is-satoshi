“Price is what you pay. Value is what you get.” - Warren Buffett
There isn't a single person on this sub who can tell me how to determine the value of a Bitcoin. None of you are investors; you're speculators.

Yes. Pull it out and buy "The Intelligent Investor" by Benjamin Graham. Then buy some goddamn stocks in high-quality companies and hold for 30 years. You'll make far more money doing that than participating in the Bitcoin mania.

Yet Bitcoin is denominated in USD. The US dollar has value because of all the valuable goods and services produced in the United States. Bitcoin, on the other hand, will never be widely adopted and has very niche use cases. Just another juicy bubble waiting to pop. It's going to be studied by all future economics students as a prime example of human greed and their endless capacity for justifying dumb luck.

There will be no financial revolution and the banking system isn't weird. Do you really think the US dollar is going anywhere? Fuck no. 
@_date: 2018-01-01 17:30:13
No, you simply don't understand how currencies really work. People like Buffett and Munger do, which is why they immediately see Bitcoin as total nonsense. 
@_date: 2018-01-11 00:38:18
It's not about not understanding the technology behind Bitcoin. Buffett simply understands that something being or using a novel technology does not make something a good investment. It's not like you're so forward-thinking and Buffett is a stick-in-the-mud. He's far wiser than you.

Understanding a technology is not equivalent to understanding investing. Buffett understands investing, which is why he's able to see through all the bullshit hype about cryptocurrency. None of you should call yourselves investors; you're speculators.

No. You should never buy Bitcoin. Buy a stock like Boeing instead.

Of course it's a concern. People can believe in things all they want. That belief doesn't give them value. The best investment this person can make is buying "The Intelligent Investor" by Benjamin Graham and learning about market folly.

What is the value of a bond? The discounted value of the cash flows you receive. 
What is the value of a stock? The discounted value of the cash flows a company generates divided by number of shares outstanding.
What is the value of a Bitcoin? The discounted value of the greed and fear of speculators. Right now, there's a lot of fear, and I've got my popcorn ready.

Sure, but it won't be replaced. The world was just fine without Bitcoin.

The idea of a borderless currency is absolutely ludicrous. Just look at all the problems the Euro has caused. Currencies are backed by the production of valuable products and services. If one country doesn't produce much of value and another is constantly innovating and generating value, the innovative country's currency will be more valuable. As it should be. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 03:05:41
There is nothing illusory about the value the United States is producing. That's why the dollar means something. The only thing Bitcoin produces is hysteria.
@_date: 2017-12-28 04:37:51
The dollar acts as a “medium of exchange” and is only valuable because it can be exchanged for goods and services. It is one’s production that is the actual backing of the dollar, not the piece of paper itself.
From this it follows that because the Chinese growth story is really a debt growth story, the yuan is going to plummet once bankruptcies set in. This is how currencies work. They cannot be based on fairy tales.

There is always an element of speculation in purchasing an equity. But that does not mean the degree of speculation is even remotely the same as speculating on Bitcoin. Why? Because a stock is an ownership piece of a real business producing value. If you make conservative assumptions when discounting estimated cash flows to determine a fair value and purchase with a margin of safety to allow for unfavorable developments, you can be reasonably confident that you'll make a decent return on your investment. Of course, most people hold multiple equities and this diversification helps them avoid catastrophic losses while increasing the chances of success.  
With Bitcoin, people don't even bother estimating a fair value. Why? Because they can't. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 17:08:53
Using one's brain is more important than having a strategy based on nothing. The best strategy is to avoid Bitcoin like the plague and invest in value-generating assets. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 05:31:29
People aren't investing, they're speculating. It doesn't require everyone to buy Bitcoin for it to be a bubble. It has more to do with the REASONS people buy. As far as I can tell, the majority are only buying because they hope they can sell it to another fool for a higher price at a later time. Ask them what they think the real value is. All you'll get is a nonanswer. Real investors have an idea of what the asset they're purchasing is worth, and they try to buy it for less than it's worth.

Still overvalued. Wake me up when it's $0. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 02:43:36
Good. Sell all your crypto and buy shares of Apple tomorrow morning instead. Way better use of your money.

No it isn't. People love mental accounting tricks, but they're just that, tricks. All money is the same. If you sold all of it back in December, you'd have a lot more money to put into index funds and bonds than you do now.

Patiently holding a piece of crap isn't going to turn it into a productive asset even if you hold it for the next 1000 years. Start buying stocks instead. Then you'll own pieces of businesses that will continue to grow and produce for you over the years.
