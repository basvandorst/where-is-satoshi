Traceback (most recent call last):

    util = imp.load_source('util', 'lib/util.py')

i'm following this tutorial :D
But at the setup.py install i'm stuck with the error in the OP
@_date: 2014-12-10 10:25:42
I'm stuck at this part: 




  File "setup.py", line 13, in &lt;module&gt;

Ty so much for the clarification! Will try to build electrum 2.0 from source
@_date: 2014-12-15 14:27:02
Not the first time but yes, i'm a noob
@_date: 2014-12-10 10:45:49
exactly what i was searching for, thanks!
@_date: 2015-05-02 16:58:44
just the hex value

As far as i know now btchip support only greenaddress, will the chrome extenstion be a standard wallet or a multisig one?
@_date: 2015-01-24 19:13:01
bitcoin wallet for android &gt; everyday spending (super fast and smooth experience)
electrum on my laptop as a warm wallet

Now the error is:

Hey aussie, thanks for sharing your experience.
Can i ask you what are the differences between 1.0.1 and 1.0.1beta?
@_date: 2015-01-24 19:02:32
i lol'd hard :D
@_date: 2017-03-27 11:36:06
we want to see your tx with this incredible fee

theymos alt account spotted
@_date: 2015-05-02 08:10:11
Thanks, but i still can't figure out what i should input on electrum to restore my a btchip seed in a standard wallet.
Also, can i ask you a good ubuntu APDU application to tweak the btchip settings?
@_date: 2017-08-20 07:11:27
Well, if you are under heavy torture i highly doubt that you will be concerned about the security of your multisig setup... I mean... what do you expect that the other multisig parties are gonna do? Leave you in excruciating pain? 
There will be of course a "hidden but trusted" - no morality - no question asked - escrow that will hold the bitcoins till the release of the kidnapped person
So start today throwing away your bitcoin plated BMW, or at least that damn plate.

I hope in a future for my children without physical banks neither assholes to deal with, just to have your finances "protected"
@_date: 2017-04-09 05:45:53
just don't
if some attacker find 6 words, is computationally easy to bruteforce the other 6 to find the whole seed
@_date: 2017-04-11 08:47:07
@_date: 2017-04-05 07:11:05
this isn't a sane input for discussion

I need to make a question: as full routable IP address, is Andreas referring to have an assigned IP block + AS Number from a RIR and the ability to create a personal BGP session to announce the own IPs?
Or he just refer to have an internet access without a CG-NAT, so basically have an assigned public IP address to the router?
@_date: 2015-04-28 08:46:44
Thanks mate

What is blockstream and why greenaddress would join this company?
@_date: 2016-07-08 16:35:20
mine is not a critic to the teaching of decentralized systems to kids. it's just a concern about the computer use.
@_date: 2016-07-08 21:22:56
kudos for your experience
@_date: 2016-07-09 10:21:39
you are joking with an urgency (accident), that has nothing to do with knowledge about it
@_date: 2015-02-10 12:56:55
Cointellect was a well-managed ponzi that has kept almost all his assets in cryptocurrencies. With the btc price that was falling down in january, they simply are unable to continue to pay nobody.
@_date: 2016-07-08 16:15:40
kids in this age shouldn't stay in front of a computer. i just hope that you have been able to do a completely abstract explanation 
@_date: 2016-07-14 16:39:28
I can sell you one with escrow, pm me if interested
@_date: 2016-07-08 20:01:11
the positive thing is basically that you don't feel yourself as a slave of a magic black box that works in a totally unknow way.
The kid has got a powerful brain to learn the raw basics of many things, so if you feed his knowledge with the instructions to build something from scratch, you are giving him powerful tools that he will be able to greatly improve in the future (became a programmer, an engineer, ecc...)
if you give the bitcoin application ready to use to a child, he will be able to do his first transaction.. but then? end of the challenge 
in my opinion, you need FIRST to teardown a computer in front of the child, and explain the function of every component (cpu, gpu, ram, ecc...). And this not before of his 11-12 years, depending of how much curious he is.
@_date: 2016-07-08 16:49:34
that's perfect in my opinion
@_date: 2016-07-08 16:17:14
you are my hero! love vanitygen

fine mate! aint't going to hurt your opinions

Why this site?
@_date: 2016-07-08 17:24:07
man, careful with technology. It's not just the knowledge, it's also a question about the exposition of a young brain in front of a complex machine.

Paypal allows you to gift paypalUSD for a 0 paypalUSD fee
@_date: 2016-07-08 17:50:50
it's hard to explain, but the kid should known how the complex machine works before using its top layer (os, software).
