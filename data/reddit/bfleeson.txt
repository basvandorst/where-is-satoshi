Can any one put me straight on this?
 Is the derivatives market where the smart contracts ( using Bitcoins and block chains) are targeted? If so, is the possible value of Bitcoin equal to that section?

Commerce and the movements of funds do make a currency ( fiat or crypto ) stronger. If Bitcoin acceptance can be matched with international shipping,  or providing services internationally then Bitcoin &amp; all will start replacing credit cards and Paypal.

Shouldn't this thread be in bor I am not in the US and all these NY related stories are forgetting very spammy. Please can US readers please realize that there are many countries using this forum that do not care what the USA are doing. 
As for this issue I believe that NewYork is sill a democracy, so if you do not like who is is charge, vote them out!!!

I think you mean zero's and one's. We left shades of gray back in the analogue age. :-)

I second this. Please give us an alturnative service and I will leap at it too. 
I will take the oppotunity to say that my home based miners are pointing to smaller pools, but I want to reinvest the earnings somewhere and CEX.io seems to be the sole sorce of hosted GHS without a expiry date. If you know of  a good alturnative please let me know! :-)

Thank you to BurtNaked for the suggestion of using the Multipool.us / Cryptsy combination  the last time this subject came up. You may be glad to hear that I have now moved everything out of CEX and purchased MHS hosting at Cryptsy instead.
However I do still say that these other services need to raise thier when it comes to marketing and ease of use. :-)

Remove the Hard disk first and then boot from live CD or USB with Ubuntu Linux, or if this is an old laptop then a lighter version of Linux may be better like XUbuntu.

So far, a UK£10 Asda ( Walmart.uk) voucher from pock.io 
This showed the wife that bitcoins do make a real difference ( ie put food on the table).

No Not overkill. A SD card will need wiping multiple times with random number content or chopping in to bits otherwise the content can be recovered.

I'm uk based an I use pock.io 
This is a gift card for bitcoin service and works great for me.

I am still fairly new to digital currencies, but is'n the '2 of 3' Bitcoin feature ment to help with secutity? Wouldn't it mean that you can loose 1 key, but still recover your cash. Anyone have links to tutorials on how to do this?

A 'bit' in english is 'a small part of' this may be 1/8th of a byte, or 1/1,000,000th of a BTC. They are still a bit of a puzzle!

I guess you are refering to illigal imagrants. Every day in the uk we welcome thousands of legal imagrants who work hard to send money home. For these people I can see that Bitcoins &amp; other crypto currencies bypass commercial overpriced money exchange services.
I can imagin that illigal imagrants are similar, they are comming to earn money here to send home. If this is the case then the same money transfer facility will equally useful just as soon as they escape the cluches of the human trafficers that keep them as wage slaves.

Thanks for the suggestion. I now have a scrypt miner running and using multipool.us.
However I can not buy MHS from other peoples hosted services through this training site. With CEX I can buy MHS without an expiry date.
I was buying MHS through MinerKing.com which does offer lifetime MHS purchase ( but no trading) however they price their management fees in BTC and have not dropped the costs with the rise of the BTC/US$ price. This means that for each BTC created they are taking 66%. I recommend avoiding MinerKing untill they start pricing their fees in US$ and taking a more fair split in the profits. CEX currently charge $0.26/GHS per month which is much more reasonable!
However the main point is that if you wish to have a more even spread of hashing, don't put down those pools doing a good job, but help those that are under par to get better!

The issue you are having here is that you are releasing the money before the work is done. This does not encourage people to do the work. What you need is to release the money after it has been added to the project. 
As for the 'Wish list' , i am sure that developers are grateful for a wish list, but this is an open source project where the programmers will work on what ever takes their fancy. Any attempt to ‘force’ what section of the project gets worked on will not work.

Remembet that HSBC-uk has First Direct, a telephone and internet only personal banking section. Crypto currencies like Bitcoin are made for this type of enviroment. (money to the customers phone without an auto-teller/cash machine). The international nature of Bitcoint is great too!

I have been giving this issue some thought over the last few weeks. With cryptocurrencies there is a method of rewarding miners, and this seems to be working well. However the programmers, who are ultimately in control of the protocol, need to add a system where a fraction of the mining fee goes to the programming pool. This fund then needs to be divided between the programmers that have made a contribution to the protocol in proportion to the service they have added to the project. This is not easy as a small piece of brilliantly coded code may be worth far more than reams of more basic coding. This leads me to think that the project leader/ leader team will need to decide and dole out the funds as they see fit.
I would like the reward system to be open and distributed in the same way that the block chain is. Maybe there could be a voting system integrated, similar to the Reddit up-vote/ down-vote system that will remove the need for reliance on one person or team to distribute the funds. However I suspect that this would take much more programming to implement.

I use CEX.io because it is easy to use and trade BTC, NMC, and MHS. All this with low service charges. Is there an alturnative service that is as good or better. If there is I will switch, as I expect will many others. If you want a more even split in hashing rates, step up to the mark and give traders the services they need!

Three confirmations by everyone if it is a big light bulb would be recommended!
