What are your reasons for leaving CB?

I’m a total crypto noob myself, and I too bought BTC when it was very high. I have yet to break even, which I do not intend to do as I will continue to HODL. Do you honestly believe that bitcoin will be anywhere near the current prices, say, in 2 - 5 year’s time? Just look at the OP and how the prices have increased on a yearly basis..

Bitcoin is an incredible long-term investment, regardless which price you bought it at.

Thank you for everyone’s comments and advice, much appreciated.

That’s what I was thinking.

In fairness, they’ve finally implemented their upgrade which should hopefully have ironed out many of their problems.

Isn’t that part of normal due diligence/KYC?
@_date: 2018-02-02 08:17:28
Amen to that.

Love it! xD

Not nice to call someone a cigarette.

You MUST watch all of them, best TV ever, “Nosedive” was my favourite episode.

Apologies, that’s what I meant, i.e. Whitgift Shopping Centre, although there is talk of them building a Westfield at some point in the future!
@_date: 2019-09-03 10:56:16
Yep, taken at Whitgift.

Back entrance to Westfield shopping centre.

Love it!

Yep, it’s stuff like this that pains me that we’re leaving the EU, but hey ho, at least we’re getting our blue passports back.. ;)
