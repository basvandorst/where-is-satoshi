There really isn’t a limit besides money.  If the government were willing to make the investment they could produce enough ASICS within 12-18months.  It’s possible an agency like the CIA/NSA already has enough hashing power right now! They build plenty of computers solely for the purpose of decryption and the main way we know to break encryption is via brute force.
@_date: 2018-01-02 23:02:18
In all seriousness, any serious investor/government agency is easily capable of 51% attacking bitcoin.  That will really be the death knell of btc.

It's an interesting thought experiment to see how the block chain could be used maliciously. I'm not sure why I'm getting getting so many down votes for it though.
@_date: 2014-05-16 09:16:58
I don't understand your point. The end goal of such an exploit could be to steal the user's bitcoins, it doesn't have to take over root privileges on the user's machine. A potentially malicious action could be constrained within the wallet with privileges the wallet already has.
There's no need to be patronizing either, I have a modicum of understanding on how real security exploits work.

@_date: 2014-05-16 07:36:23
I know what the block chain is. The point is that someone could theoretically put malicious message in it that when run through a miner or wallet gives them access to the user's computer through an unknown vulberability.

You're not "that guy" you're "that dick"
@_date: 2014-04-11 02:32:38
So how about that bitcoin market huh.
@_date: 2014-05-16 11:16:15
I don't buy that.  Plenty of non malicious and non compromised executables have had security vulnerabilities that have been exploited by dedicated people.   The bitcoin codebase is huge and complex, it's bound to have undiscovered vulnerabilities.
@_date: 2014-12-19 02:47:13
I believe it was around February 2013. It's really gotten out of hand lately though.
@_date: 2014-05-16 07:38:37
What if the wallet software or the mining daemon has a day one vulnerability in it that allows arbitrary code to be executed and the delivery mechanism is the block chain itself.
@_date: 2014-12-22 14:40:55
Omg its happening, to the moon!!!!
@_date: 2014-05-16 09:32:20
I understand how buffer overflows work and how theyre dealt with. Correct me if I'm wrong though, but there isn't just one wallet software and one mining daemon, there are dozens of different implementations. What are the odds that one of those has an exploitable flaw that can be transmitted through the blockchain?
@_date: 2014-05-16 09:33:08
Your first paragraph implies that my understanding of exploits comes from TV shows and movies...
@_date: 2014-09-23 17:03:28
I received my miner, and sold it for about 30% more than I paid for it, so I got something out of butterfly labs at least.  I didn't spend anytime mining with it though, was too late at that point.
@_date: 2014-05-16 10:54:21
Why would there be an executable? What if the goal was to get the wallet to send all the users  bitcoins to an address? Or maybe the goal is to get the mining daemon to verify a false transaction.
@_date: 2014-05-16 08:23:15
It happens all the time.
 Are you implying me those software packages have never had a single vulnerability?

You can track bitcoin through the blockchain and find out where its going from Bitcoins -&gt; Exchange.  If you change those bitcoins into LTC however and then a few days later bring them back out as BTC, it becomes harder to figure out who bought the bitcoins and where they came from.

what if the price goes below that? 
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:42:38
This isn't exponential growth.  A lot of the community here is confusing exponential growth for what's happening to the bitcoin market.  It's simply untrue.  What's going on is the social media effect which can appear like exponential growth, however as people's interest starts to die down, a sharp decrease in activity will follow and that's what we're seeing today.
Basically, bitcoins 15 minutes of fame are up.

I bought a Jalapeno on February 21st, I got in in the mail a week ago! Sold it for ~$470 for a nice 80% ROI. Might have been better to have just purchased some bitcoin at the time however.  If I had received my Jalapeno 2 months earlier the ROI would have been significantly greater.
@_date: 2013-04-07 06:08:14
Ahh yes Tax Evasion, what a splendid use of bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:22:22
I hope you sold...
@_date: 2013-04-25 17:13:09
Doesn't make sense... with 10k Jalapenos shipped you estimate difficulty at 17,000,000, 
5GH still nets you ~.15BTC/day or ~$25/day, not the .001BTC/day you estimate.
I mean you don't really think they're going to sell 10k of the $30,000 1500Ghash miner do you O_o
Consider that only Jalapenos will be shipping at first... Every Jalapeno shipped and ordered early enough should pay for itself!
@_date: 2013-04-12 12:58:49
There is one thing that does give bitcoin a tangible price and that is the cost to mine bitcoins.  Miners will be reluctant to sell a bitcoin or mine them in the first place if the coins sell for less than it costs to mine in electricity and hardware.

$50k/year that might suddenly drop to $5k/year the next year.  It's very risky.  I wouldn't quit my day job over it either unless I was making 150k+ Net.

@_date: 2013-04-11 18:01:42
Seriously, there is NOTHING that makes bitcoin worth that much, in fact the recent run up has been dangerous to bitcoins long term future IMO.  It's going to take a while for people to actually treat it as a currency and change their perceptions of it instead of the speculative device that it's been presented as in the past few months.
@_date: 2013-04-19 18:54:38
They're shipping the Jalapenos first though, not the Singles, so good luck with that.
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:56:14
Wouldn't Mt. Gox know who is doing it though?  Since accounts are supposedly verified?  I know a DDOS might be difficult to identify since it comes from huge a huge amount of sources, but what about large profiteering that occurs simultaneously?
@_date: 2013-04-08 17:49:23
It's a huge game of speculation right now, that's the unfortunate thing about it.  
I personally refuse to buy into the pyramid scheme bitcoin is being manipulated into.  I've just been waiting for my ASIC for a while now(BFL cmon, ordered 4 months ago before the huge run up!)

What good is a deed and title? Who guarantees your ownership of it? I find your deed invalid, who are you to question me?
I don't necessarily believe in might equals right, that might be true in the animal world, but not our own civilized one.  
The point is that the government is the one who deems your deed correct and recognizes your right to ownership. It is through them that I recognize your ownership, otherwise what would there be to stop me?
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:20:33
That was a stupid idea IMO.

If you order one today possibly, depending on how many Singles and Minirigs are actually out there.  If you already had one on preorder though and get it ASAP you should make a nice profit :) 
My Order number is ~16000 for my Jalapeno...  Hopefully with enough people having cancelled and me being ahead by virtue of ordering a Jalepeno, my $165 investment should pay off very well!

I don't see why a Big Firm like Goldman sachs or so couldn't easily afford to gain 50% of the hashing power and do such a thing.  
Going by the Cost of the 1,500GH/s from BFL, it would cost them ~$1.3 million to get 66,000GH/s, enough to get 51%.  In the future it will be more difficult as ASICs become more widespread, but still not insurmountable, just more expensive.  But if they could profit $50million or more? Why not.

You'll be more like 50,000-60,000 in line if you order now :P  Then again, the 50GH/s miners will still make a decent profit even with difficulty going up, just by virtue of their high hashing rate.

It's going way lower than that, it's at $170 on btc-e and shooting downwards.  Gox is lagging atm and the lag is increasing, which means a panic sell is going off and once Gox catches up, it's going to be way less than $200...

Yes Unfortunately that's by the design of bitcoin.  You can't expect humans not to act in their self interest, you have to design the system so that their self interest is everyone elses.
With the deflationary nature of bitcoin, it's better to hoard it than to spend it, so that's exactly what you're seeing right now in the market.  Not to mention, it's unregulated nature and low supply make it easy for anyone to manipulate.

When's the crash coming?

Basically its a giant pyramid scheme.

Searching for bitcoin on craigslist, all I see are scams.

If I have a million bitcoins and I only need to spend ~1bitcoin/day to live off of, why should I spend the rest of my bitcoins?  I would be better off saving them if I have a guaranteed increase in buying power.  Point being why should I ever invest in a company or business or anything for that matter if I feel like my bitcoins will always increase?  
Secondly, why would I ever take a loan out in bitcoins?

Wow! That looks like a good catch...  It does seem overly suspicious that he would delete his posts and information so quickly after you "outed" him.

So are you going to put your money where your mouth is?
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:26:24
Yes they are, people are in such denial...
@_date: 2013-04-15 13:35:54
Deposit your bitcoins on btc-e, exchange them for ltc, then exchange back again for btc to another address.

look at all the posts on reddit in All capitulation.

The only vile person is the OP himself.

No I think we're at Fear at this point.

I sold some BTC at 93 and bought more back at 89... Wish I had waited till it hit 65 to buy back :(

Your dad taught you a valuable lesson.
@_date: 2013-04-12 04:54:11
No you're just an idiot.

We're going to conjure up some wacky conspiracy theories.
