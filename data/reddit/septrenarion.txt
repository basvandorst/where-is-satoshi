By sin, I was referring to "thou shalt not steal" haha, that's a big one for us believers. By way of your thesis, I would say you are correct in thinking there is more non-faith members in the active crypto community relative to other assets classes that are traded. As for generala doption, I would say the majority of coiners are members of a religious community. Think of worldwide cellphone adoption, most are believers for the simple fact that most people in the world belong to a traditional belief system.

I keep track of everything I purchase. Then I use a crypto profit calculator app to narrow down the difference between the price now and how much I put in.

I'm a student of the Bible. I'm waiting for Jesus to return as Messiah. I love Gold and Silver, but I also love Bitcoin because I believe inflation of the money supple is theft and a sin against God.
