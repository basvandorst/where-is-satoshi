Lol, you're getting downvoted for wanting to know facts...

Thank you for that video, very interesting. That's exactly how I feel, it's always hard for me to put into words and makes me sound like I'm advocating for Trump. I thought Trump was the lesser of two evils at the time (I didn't vote for him or Hillary). His personality is garbage, but I'd rather deal with that than a corrupt Hillary being in office. The man in the video says about there being a shock factor to invoke change on the left and I am with him 100% on that. If Bernie was the primary, I could have been persuaded to get behind him. I don't even think the democrats have woken up yet that they need to have a major change to win the next election. The current candidates that they have announced don't look very promising. I think the only chance they have is for Biden to run and I hope he does. I just don't think he wants to run other than to unseat Trump and I wouldn't wish it upon anyone to do a job that they don't really want to do. I'm getting really sick of the neo-liberals as you call them and I feel they keep pushing people further from the left. I didn't agree with some things that you said earlier in the thread, but maybe that was just misinterpretation on my end. The video helped me see your point and I'm glad that someone was able to show me how I feel in better words than I could describe.

This. I see that there is a right wing echo chamber, but it seems to me that the left wing one is way larger. I just sit back and eat my popcorn.
Edit: I hate popcorn, but you get the idea.
