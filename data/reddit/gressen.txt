Good read. I like this part: " If one country practiced irresponsible monetary policies, the exchange rates punished them and devalued their currency. But what happens when everyone acts irresponsibly? Bitcoin is what happens."

My cost is $5.95/mo and consists only of the VPS fee, but short search will get you a guy that did to do it for $19/yr.

I get your point and I guess it is just a matter of your requirements. $200 will buy me 3 years of node operation with virtually no concerns about hardware upkeep, upgrades, uptime, redundancy, electricity costs and such.
I used to run a node at home on a machine I've built myself but at the moment I have no use for a box that operates on a consumer-grade hardware and network.
I guess I'm trying to say that it all depends on what you want to achieve. For my needs VPS trumps self managed solution. Do I need it? No. Does it make things easier? Yeah!

Thanks, I've had a look at your github and added it to the post.

This is the cool part - if you do it using a VPS server then all hardware upkeep aspects are handled by the company that hosts your server. My node is in Netherlands and I'm not.

There are so many variables here. Right now the blockchain needs 25GB. Assuming 1GB/mo my current low-spec VPS will reach it's usability limit in a year or so.
What happens after that highly depends on ideas such as [blockchain prunning]( or DHT blockchain storage.

Thank you. This will go towards covering the VPS cost.

You mean tor? What is the benefit?

Why is it better to run an alternative implementation?

Thanks for the feedback. That is my concern too, but I have current blocks on all three networks and they seem to work just fine for now. Time will tell more.

I agree that there will be less and less people keeping an entire blockchain on their home computers but not everyone needs to. This is another good reason why running hosted nodes is a good idea.
There may be a time in the future when inexpensive VPSes will no longer serve as good nodes.
@_date: 2014-09-02 11:12:34
Thanks for keeping the node up for such long time.
This is not supposed to be impressive. It is supposed to remind people that the network needs full nodes to remain healthy. The low number of nodes is an ongoing topic and can quickly become a problem in the future.

How did you generate that plot and what are those heat-maps?

I find it amusing, that each story like that makes me wanna buy coins and/or hop on the mining train and each time I end up convincing myself that the whole thing is just too risky yet to get financially involved. Not very often something brings so mixed emotions.

I sometimes drop in to see if there are any signs of life, but no luck so far. I will continue to try
@_date: 2011-05-15 23:15:27
Yes, but the problem is that if you are not sure how stable the whole idea is in the long run then any amount spent today can be thought of as lost. Just the kind of pessimist I am.

You may want to revisit your decision about making business with godaddy, reddit may not approve (and for good reasons).
