Weekly volume on localbitcoins.com is topping 1m SEK (~500BTC) and rising: 
@_date: 2015-06-15 19:24:19
Thank you!
@_date: 2015-06-15 19:18:43
Good point. So far I've only looked into weekly data. The traditional remittance markets (KES, PHP etc) are growing very fast and there's bound to be a lot of noise on a daily basis.
@_date: 2015-06-29 11:40:51
Because of Greece? :) 
Check this out, EUR is not exactly spiking but had highest volume 
since late 2013: 
So yes there is a pickup in EUR. However, the Greece/Bitcoin story is being hyped from all sides but so far Greeks don't seem bothered by Bitcoin too much. Even at this stage it's too niche, plus the Greeks are not very technology/internet savvy as some other countries.
On another note, in early 2013, Bitcoin rose quickly while the Cyprus crisis played out. So people were quick to link the two together. Unfortunately, there is no proof that Bitcoin rose in price because of Cyprus.

Thanks for your reply!
I believe there is a service that converts bitcoin to M-Pesa (bitpesa?). M-Pesa allows mobile phone users in Kenya to transfer money between phones. It's been around for ages and ubiquitous. So if you can find a coffee grower in Kenya that accepts payments via M-Pesa it shouldn't be a problem...
@_date: 2015-06-15 19:24:06
I believe UK is also on SEPA so that shouldn't be a problem. However I think UK banks are generally more cautious about BTC so this might be the reason for people to turn to LBTC. Same goes for Sweden which has 25% of EUR/BTC turnover with perhaps 2-3% of Eurozone population.
Eurozone citizens shouldn't have any problems using centralized exchanges so that's why EUR is relatively low volume.
@_date: 2015-06-29 11:45:25
Don't know about all bitcoins, but the weekly estimated transaction volume of all Bitcoin (all output that is not deemed change) is around 1.5m BTC (blockchain.info). 
So LBTC does about 2% of that. I think that is quite significant.

True, but the volume is still tiny in comparison to the global BTC trade volume. So any sell pressure on this scale (100k USD in one week) won't put a dent in the BTC price. Nor would any buy pressure of the same size.

@_date: 2014-11-15 15:58:27
Short explanation:
I took the market price and market trading volume (both in USD) form Blockchain. I then did a cumulative sum of market trading volume and plotted it against market price.
This makes the graph wider ("progressing faster") when there's a lot of trading going on, and thinner ("slower") when things are quiet.
Logarithmed it on both axes so the early price movements are shown more clearly.

No admins needed. Anyone can claim an article to be true, it's up to the reader to verify this article by hashing it and looking up that hash in the blockchain. 
If someone wants to amend an article, he sends a transaction (containing the hash of the edit) to the address corresponding to the article.

Bitcoin isn't a stock. 
Furthermore, define "the market". If you're talking DJIA, you only take 30 stocks into account. You'd also need to look at S&amp;P, commodities, govt bonds, HY bonds, FX, real estate, paintings and collectible cars altogether to say something about "the market".
Agree that you shouldn't just blindly buy into anything dropping in value, but the fact remains that nothing in the Bitcoin protocol has changed for the worse, and that this technology is still 5 years old. 
&lt;circlejerk&gt;Barring a killer asteroid impact or similar, the blockchain will likely exist for at least the next 100 years, perhaps even until the heat death of the known universe.&lt;/circlejerk&gt;

Well, it seems damn good advice for nearly any asset that's fluctuating in value. And it has worked very well in the past, gauging the content of posts during all time highs/lows.
The main problem Buffett (as a value investor) has with bitcoin is that it's impossible to gauge its "true" value. As in, a stock share is linked to tangible assets: cash, fixed + working capital, debt, employees, clients, marketshare.
Bitcoin doesn't have any of that. It's just 0s and 1s.

@_date: 2014-09-28 18:21:31
It all depends. You have to look into how much money upfront is going into mining. If the hash rate is going up like crazy, there is demand for mining rigs and thus bitcoin. Some ballpark figures (mostly taken from Bitcoin Wisdom):
Currently, the hashrate is going up by 50,000 TH/s per month. That's 25,000 TerraMiner IVs  @ $6000 or $150M per month being invested into the mining pool. (In reality it's more because a lot of mining rigs become obsolete *fast* and need to be replaced.)
(As an aside, most efficient machine I could find was the SP30 Yukon: 5.4TH/s @ $12000 so you'd need 10k of those costing $120M to match the increasing hashrate.)
1 month of mining = 30x144x25 = 108000 Bitcoins. 
That makes a whopping $1500 per bitcoin being invested last month! Am I making a calculation error somewhere?

Be aware that price volatility is only one risky aspect of bitcoin. You also have to take security very seriously, because it's easy for others to steal your private keys.

I don't see why LTC cannot be used as a store of value or transfer money at low cost. It's not much different from BTC in that respect. LTC is PERCEIVED as different and therefore is valued lower. I'm speculating that it will rise in value just like it did in April (when it went from 0.001BTC to 0.04BTC almost overnight).
Ultimately an altcoin's success depends on the miners. Each new altcoin has to compete with its predecessors for limited mining hardware. It's risky to start mining a new altcoin when the one that you're currently mining is "safe". Therefore the longer an altcoin "exists" (i.e. actively mined), the more it has proven itself as a coin.

Thanks Erik, good to hear one of the main drivers behind Bitcoin give his honest opinion. The price has gone crazy, and while I think Bitcoin is worth more than it is today, there is no guarantee that the rest of the world will value it similarly.
Everyone: don't think of BTC as an investment - you're part of a new way of interaction, just like the WWW was 20 years ago. That is worth the time, effort and money you've put into it. I actually can't believe it took 20 years to go from WWW to bitcoin...

Why do you want to invest in BTC? 
If you're looking to make a quick buck (cash out at +100%) then it's best to buy now as the bubble hype is building up again.
If you're willing to sit it out and see BTC rise to $10000(0) (if this ever happens, mind you), then getting in now or next week doesn't make much difference.
Whichever way, prepare yourself mentally for never seeing that money again, just to manage expectations.

a) Data is provided in Unix time and I'm lazy
b) using linear instead of log means throwing 3/4 of the chart away with white space. moreover this shows the **growth** of LTC market cap compared to BTC. 
You're right though, if you were to add up both lines it would create a new line 1 pixel higher than the btc market cap, so you cannot infer scale from this graph.
@_date: 2013-07-21 14:48:53
The bitcoin market is still incredibly small and immature, which explains the large price swings. Once BTC becomes mature, the hoarding stabilizes (the economy is not infinitely big so there's an upper limit to the BTC market cap) and the price swings will smooth out. 
You're right that speculation leads to a positive feedback loop where prices rise and rise until they crash - however they crash to a higher level than before the runup. Also, the 2nd bubble was already less extreme than the 1st one and part of a longer upward trend (see

I think BTC will always remain the nr 1 coin, because of its spot in the limelight and support from developers.
However, there will always be demand for an alternative, just in case bitcoin suffers a setback. If somehow SHA256 gets compromised, LTC won't be affected.

A corollary: a lot of people seem to think they:
- shouldn't invest anything into Bitcoin, because it's fake
- should invest all their money, and borrow some more, because nothing's gonna stop Bitcoin rising in value
But nothing in between... What gives?
Also, I've seen a lot of people cash out all their bitcoins. Why not cash out x% and keep (100-x)% should the price rise even more?

Oh the human brain and its need for clearly distinguishable causation patterns!
There are 1001 reasons why BTC went up. Most likely just because it's been getting a lot of attention. But I'm generalizing.
@_date: 2013-11-10 19:18:21
So let's keep bitcoins to Americans?
@_date: 2013-08-27 17:03:03
First off, BTC is going up in shocks. If it goes from $100 to $1k it won't do so in a straight line, but suddenly, in a bubble like fashion as happened when it went from $10 to $100. People need to get used to triple digits first. Whether it goes at an average of 900% a year or 100% a year, there will be a sudden spurt.
Second, the daily global transaction volume of foreign exchange is around $4 trillion. Assuming the BTC turnover at 5% of mkt cap, going from $1bn to $10bn marktet cap (i.e. $50m to $500m daily transaction volume) is a drop in the bucket.
Purely speculating, I would say you'll see BTC growth leveling off at $10k per bitcoin.

You have to put it into context of Taleb's book Antifragile. There, he writes that antifragile systems will grow because they are being "shocked". The bigger the shocks (bitcoin in the news, bitcoin being banned, wallets stolen etc) the more it will grow. Note that "shocks" can be good or bad.

Taking 1% of the market isn't going to do much when your product is of similar quality to your competitor's. Bitcoin, however, is so different and in many cases so much better than its alternatives, that it will easily take a 1% stake.

Actually from this chart you can somewhat infer that BTC tends to linger around psychological barriers: $1, $10 (for 2 years), and now $100. So I have no doubt we'll see a quick growth from $100 to $1000, the question is how long we'll be hanging around $100.

Well, in general: media attention triggers awareness, whether it's good or bad attention. The attention usually focuses on a property of bitcoin (silk road / exponential rise in value / wallets stolen / exchanges hacked) that makes people want to know more, and thus has the potential for a wider audience to take up bitcoin. This is important, because Bitcoin's success depends almost entirely on its spread among the world's population.

BTC is going to be big in the developing world. The total BTC market cap is 1000x smaller than the total annual remittance volume (=money sent to country of origin by immigrants). 
Also, it's a highly secure, decentralized, highly mobile store of value. Unlike gold which needs to be stored in a safe, can be confiscated etc.

It wouldn't be so great if it weren't for those gigantic oil fields just out west.
All kidding aside: the problem is not government. The problem is, who governs the government? Norway is such a tiny country (±5m people) that it's easy for everyone to have reasonable influence on the government. Like, say, Switzerland or Iceland. 
Besides having ample natural resources and a stable democracy, there's a scale effect. When countries become bigger (EU, US, Japan, China), problems are not addressed but ignored because people have no influence. There's no direct line between people and their government. Those who create problems have the influence: war mongers, industrialists, bankers.

BTC is still an experimental currency. There's no guarantee the price will keep rising. So buying and holding might not be the best strategy.

**tl;dr** a 25% drop overnight is nothing compared to a continuous 1000% yoy rise. So buy &amp; hold for now.
Ever since bitcoin trading began in July 2010, its price has been going up by an average of +1000% a year. Now, the past is no guarantee of future performance, but given that SO MANY people have not heard about Bitcoin but SURELY WILL in the near future, makes it a screaming hold for me. Good luck daytrading - you won't be able to keep up unless you quit your job and "spend 15 hours a day in the trollbox". (thanks for the phrase Basically it requires a rethink about volatility. Bitcoin is nothing compared to stocks. If it goes down, it goes down big. If it goes up, it goes up even bigger.
@_date: 2013-10-29 20:01:42
OK, I get your point. But to be able to transfer bitcoin (if that is what you mean by "the utility it was meant to be"), you have to create awareness and get people to buy bitcoin. Obviously, mass psychology gets in the way of gradual, continuous adoption, hence the bubbly nature of bitcoin's price.
In other words, part of Bitcoin's utility is store of value, not just being a transaction mechanism. We're still mainly in the "store of value" phase, the transaction part will come when adoption is higher, possibly when BTC overtakes Western Union as 7th largest global payment network.

It depends. It all comes down to trust (do you trust the exchange or wallet? have they been hacked before? are their servers secure enough?) and the ability for you to enable multi factor authentication.
In the end both exchanges and wallets are not impervious to DDoS attacks. Safest place to keep bitcoins is a local wallet, preferrably offline, protected by Armory (= a free open source program).
@_date: 2013-07-21 16:05:02
My take: any sensible business/person dealing in BTC will retain a fraction of BTC to a point where future expectation of value exceeds the harm from volatility. The price may crash 90% but that's small change compared to the 100,000% rise sustained over the past 3 years.
If you're already allowing your business to be exposed to BTC, why suddenly sell ALL your BTC proceeds like it's a plague ridden thing? Why not keep 1%, 5%, 20% as a hedge? 
0% is the absolute lower bound, and I'm not convinced that's the average.

Things have changed dramatically since April: more people know about Bitcoin and several psychological barriers and stigmas have been removed. 
From a logaritmic chart you can see dramatic price rises every 8 months give or take - it seems like the natural rhythm for Bitcoin. So my speculation is we're still at the base of another bubble.
In the March/April runup, there were several 25% drops, but still the price ended up +1000%. So if you can time it right (and stay awake), do buy the dips. Most of them occur at 3AM :)
@_date: 2013-11-10 10:45:40
I believe it's "estimated" transaction volume compared to total output volume (which includes change). The estimation comes in two flavours: BTC and USD denominated.

Crossposting my comment on the original link:
Let me try and top this one:
* Global wealth = 250 trillion US$
* Global daily FX transaction volume = 5 trillion US$
So volume = 2% of wealth
If bitcoin were to replace all FX transactions and all wealth, then
* 12 million bitcoin currently in circulation -&gt; 240.000 bitcoins traded every day
This leads to 1 BTC = **±20 million US$**
Or, by extension, 2100 satoshi per rocky planet.
To the moon!

I agree, this is not the intended purpose of Bitcoin. There hopefully will be a time when we don't express BTC in USD or CND but in loafs of bread or barrels of oil. Until then, seeing it expressed in USD (and consequently seeing its price rise) is a necessary symptom of rapid adoption.
@_date: 2013-08-25 14:54:45
please read my words carefully:


It could be 6 months, it could be 2 years (that's what it took to get from 10 to 100), it could be 10 years, but **if** BTC grows beyond $100 (and I'm sure it will) it will move to $1000 very quickly.

It's mostly small businesses on the margins. Artists, cafes, computer stores. Those where the owner/operator is in direct contact with the customer. They have nothing to lose from BTC (any early adopter issues such as payment difficulties, fluctuating exchange rates are quickly resolved) and have a lot to gain (media exposure, increased client base). 
Other businesses are niche exporters of specialized goods (jewellery, machinery) that can pass on savings to foreign customers because the transaction fees are much lower.
Later, when people know what to expect and are comfortable with non-refundable payments, bigger businesses will jump in.

let's rephrase it in a different way. politicians are by and large untrustworthy middle men. There must be a different way, other than anonymous majority voting, to get optimal consensus -- something more decentralized, fluid and direct. 
I think using cryptography you can guarantee anonymity whilst proving that someone has a say in things.

OK, but does a vacation 10x further away add 10x more to an economy? You're burning 10x more kerosene that could have been put to good use on other economic activity, and there's only one of two destinations benefitting from your visit.

It's both, plus it's a reliable store of value. Those 3 aspects make it so valuable.

Further info: I took the 30DMA transaction volume (USD) and divided it by the 30DMA market cap (USD), both from Blockchain.info.
So it seems that the transaction volume is steadily increasing compared to the market cap. Presumably this means that the bitcoin economy is more and more becoming a closed loop - although other explanations could be given.

For the uninitiated: like nature, Bitcoin is antifragile and will benefit from modest shocks (especially coming from economists and governments)

Yes, there's a lot of speculation involved. But transactions are transactions, speculative or not.

"Obviously there are other factors but this seems to be a main one"
How do you know? All I know is people on Reddit and the IRC channels shouting "bitcoin because cyprus", followed by a bunch of bloggers and journalists picking up that meme, after which it becomes truth.
Unless we can know the exact account details of Cypriots on the exchanges, and how much money they deposited, there's only hearsay and speculation.

BTC sells itself. To paraphrase N.N.Taleb, if you have to make commercials to sell stuff, it's probably not a good product to begin with (compare Apple to Coca Cola).

Even with a savings account you're investing, because you're loaning out your money to your bank, which puts it to good use (hopefully). In return you get a cut of the proceeds i.e. interest.
With a deflationary currency, the interest is built into the currency. By saving, you reduce money supply, increasing its value. Those who want to invest now have more spending power. So, through the properties of this deflationary currency, you defer investment decisions to those who know how to do so. (Thanks for pointing this out)

I pity the fool who equalizes correlation with causation. Attention could just as well have been driven by price.
bad statistics is bad!!!
EDIT: I see you put up a clarification below, thanks
@_date: 2013-06-26 20:07:34
You're right. The way it goes is as follows:
1. Upheaval about bitcoin (price spike, price crash, regulators hatin') 
2. uninitiated people read news stories about BTC and how it's a better payment system/store of value DESPITE the association with drugs &amp; terrorists
3. a small % of readers gets converted to BTC
4. repeat
Bitcoin basically NEEDS upheaval and controversy.
@_date: 2013-12-07 16:17:28
It's the price you pay. If bitcoin wasn't going up and down so fast, there wouldn't be so many memes and gifs.
@_date: 2013-02-24 09:58:00
You have to take velocity into account: how fast does a BTC change hands? If the velocity is high (e.g. 1 BTC changes hands 100k times a day?) you prob don't need a lot of BTC to grease the economy. That puts a damper on the long term price.
Also, central banks with a vengeance might try to manipulate BTC prices by buying up loads and then dumping them later.
@_date: 2013-11-17 15:16:57
Bitcoinaverage.com now shows global average, which lets you see the spread between your currency of choice (or USD by default) and what people over the world are paying.
Ultimately this will result in the disappearance of lucrative spreads.
@_date: 2013-11-17 15:07:45


On the contrary: it's spreading bitcoin around. The higher the price, the more it gets distributed as early adopters are cashing out.
@_date: 2013-04-07 19:24:16
The ever rising BTC price is an incentive for early adopters/miners to sell. No point in holding on to your 10,000 BTC if you can exchange it for real life goods - tomorrow the price could be down to $10, or a hacker could have tapped into your wallet.
tl;dr price rises -&gt; bitcoins become more distributed
@_date: 2013-03-27 20:10:48
volatility can be avoided using options. In other words, a guaranteed price at some future date.
@_date: 2013-11-12 19:11:29
Aaaaand it's gone. Best way to store Bitcoins is in cold storage. Always assume online parties (exchanges, wallets) cannot be trusted.

Global annual remittance turnover: $250bn

@_date: 2013-07-27 08:20:23
Ummm... no, obviously the other way around. (I'm referring to a passage from the book 'Antifragile' by Taleb)
I meant to say: Coke = poison that needs lots of ads to keep market share. Apple = quality (according to Taleb) and needs way less marketing to sell products: the products sell themselves.
In that light, BTC is its own commercial, so who cares about Amir Taaki?

Isn't every investment 'financial'? Isn't any economic activity part of the real economy?
Where do you think businesses in need of financing go to (say opening a bar)? A bank. Where is my fiat money? In a bank, loaning out money to open someone's bar.


Can you give an example?

Good to have this correction. No exponential growth lasts forever, *especially* when it's going exponential on a log scale.
Also, a similar bubble happened in august 2012, where the price went -50% from top to bottom. These corrections happen *all the time*.
In short: the fundamentals of Bitcoin haven't changed, there's no fork in the blockchain, the Fed hasn't invented a quantum crypto gun. Keep on truckin'.
