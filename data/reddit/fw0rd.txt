I was bored and figured I'd give this a try. my buddy recommended it and I actually found a few btc parts in an account so hey why not. I've been watching it daily and cashing out, I'm at the point where they owe me $18. Now it's giving me an error code at payout time. "There is something wrong with your account or your request. Error code: 0xCC07C9". I never really expected it to pan out, but it was interesting... I'll send an email to their support and let people know if this is the end.
