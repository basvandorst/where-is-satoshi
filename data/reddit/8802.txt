Received no money in bitcoins but was debited $800 from my account and I'm the asshole? Please explain?

Not at all I made 4 transactions with them last week, and needed the bitcoins they promised would be in my account Friday. They debited my account almost $800 and then sent me a email saying I was a high risk transaction etc. Thinking they were going to do that on my next transactions from yesterday and today as well I went to another site and bought bitcoins so I could have them to purchase what I needed to purchase this week. I emailed them explaining this and they haven't had the decency to respond back.
The scam is they didn't refund the amount back they debited, and I have the emails to back this up if anyone thinks Im having buyers remorse etc. I had no problem paying for the BC at the price I was locked in at. Never mind the first time I made a purchase under the market value and waited the 5 days and never had the option to cancel checkbox as they promised (system error they said). I just want the money they initially debited and promised back and they haven't gone through with that yet.
My bank noticed this as well and contacted me yesterday and the CB error, I will get all my money regardless, just wanted to go about this a different way.

I sent you a PM with an issue I had regarding this same email. Hopefully you can resolve it for me. Thanks in advance

I'll post evidence in documents from emails and screenshots if you need proof Matlock. They took out $800 dollars out of my account and I don't have a bitcoin in my wallet. How is that not a scam? If you lost $800 dollars without a good or service provided would you still be flying the flag for Coinbase?

There isn't a cancel button on the transactions due for next week. I was locked in to a price. I contacted my bank tonight and they said they won't allow anymore transactions with Coinbase and they said if my refund isn't back in a few days they will investigate and do a chargeback. I forwarded them the emails Coinbase sent me tonight and the ones they sent me when I made the transactions earlier in the week. Bank said they aren't honoring there end of the transaction which gives me rights. Hopefully Coinbase will resolve this and do the right thing. 
Anyone recommend Bitfloor for US buying and selling?
