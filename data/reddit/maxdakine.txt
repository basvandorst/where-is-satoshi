best strategy is to be long from 50$, never trade, and comment "this is actually good news" in every bad news bitcoin post

I cant believe you claim to be a pro trader and downplay manipulation in the market...
in a high volume, liquid market... for that market to move requires a large entity placing orders. If you consider the EUR/USD which trades billions per day.... that market doesnt move because 10000 retail traders all decided to make the exact move at the exact time.... its CitiBank or Chase or wutever scam bank engineering a move in the market.
The same is stocks and futures and.... bitcoin.

new money was literally taking out mortgages to buy and gox isnt the only options... coinbase, bfx, btce etc are pretty easy to give money to

its not utter bullshit because the document contained insider info. The document knew that mtgox would be rebranded as gox before the gox.com was ever sold to mark kaerpopples. theres definately truth to it.

DOJ shut down gox for silk road investigation, btc to 200$... calling it.

man guys sorry for the truth but bitcoin only goes up once they squeeze enough of you die hard coiners out of your long position.
in a couple week you will see an explosive pump, but only because they got everyone to sell and think that price is going down. Once everyone is short or in fiat, they can buy a couple thousand coins and get every coiner to margin all in long and close their stupid all in margin shorts. Theres no new money in bitcoin, its the same people getting played day in day out.

200$ might be a sensational number that i pulled out of my ass, who knows... but basically if the government can shut down an exchange, then they can shut down the others as well. also government investigation into a main btc exchange violates pretty much one of the biggest sources of value of btc which is to not have the gov fuck with your shit... 
yea huge speculation, not meant to be fud... i just feel bad about this situation... theres not much that can happen that can actually be good news

you are a beast. mindblowingly interesting

kind of a shitball move to be buying peoples goxbtc at a discount with insider info...
anyway i have no faith in gox and think theres some shady stuff going on over there that is only going to hurt btc even more

Andreas pumpanopolous is a real life shill bot. Im suspicious as to why he is taking a stance that sheds a negative light on the thing that he is paid to basically shill. And hes siding with roger ver who read off of a script that mt gox wrote to say they were solvent and his buddy cz. In this unregulated game... eveyone is looking out for themselves trying to catch the lowest hanging fruit. A talking heads words mean nothing u can rest assured that wether its barry pumpbert with his worthless gbtc pumping, andreas pumpanopolos who is nasically a paid shill for btc, roger ver, or any of theae guys... the number 1 motovation is to get that lowest hanging fruit for themaelves.

so you would rather have him kept quiet, and just let gox randomly shut down 100% out of the blue? seems like that would have caused a bigger freak out
