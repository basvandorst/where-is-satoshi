Wow, that’s cool. Doing that now. Do you think there would be another cipher encoded by the source material?

Haha wouldn't that be great if the answer to the puzzle lied in the weird comment sections beneath each date's web page

Fuck yes, I’ve been bored out of my mind lately. Finally something stimulating

I have no background in cryptography, so I’ve made little to no progress. Copy pasta to online cipher breakers told me the number of numeric characters: 0 and 1 are the most common and occur equally throughout; 4, 5, and 8 occur 35 times each. 9 occurs 70 times. Deleting all other numerals except 0 and 1 results in gibberish when converted to binary. That’s all I’ve done so far

Not only am I monetarily invested in crypto, but my desire for it to succeed supports my emotional investment in crypto, which clouds my judgment in humbly accepting the flaws of bitcoin.

Not trolling here, just wondering if anyone follows any social media or news about examining and contrasting the benefits and flaws in bitcoin. Do you seek others' opinions that challenge your own beliefs about crypto? If so, where do you go?

I've had that same experience, most people I talk to don't know much about it or got burned in the short term and cashed out. While I'm a huge proponent of blockchain technology and bitcoin, I also want to understand any real flaws in bitcoin (as well as the good traits)

I agree, I’ve thought that maybe they correspond to the names of horses that won a derby on those dates but I can’t find any consistent almanacs or databases. The earliest year is 1931 so I thought maybe it had to do with famous movies that premiered. The website onthisdate.com hasn’t led me anywhere either.Maybe the numbers before the date refer to a numerical shift in the month/day/or year? It was posted on Aug 8, 2018 which may be a clue (20180808). I imagine the 12 words would be more detailed instructions for redeeming the coins.
