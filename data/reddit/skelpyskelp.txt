Like I said, go ahead and not pay your taxes and feel the wraith of the IRS. Not my problem, I'm gonna pay mine.

No it's a wallet that you store Bitcoin on so that it's not connected to the internet.

I reformated my harddrive last year and lost my Ethereum key after I bought like 1 Ethereum. Made a new wallet the next day when it was still $15 but forgot to buy some. Still got my Bitcoin though.

Okay have fun with your rebellion against the federal government. I'll just go ahead and pay my taxes (which everyone has to pay, yes even the president pays taxes) every year and not spend life in prison. Also don't use any public services the government provides like roads, schools, police, and if your house is burning down with your hardware wallet inside make sure not to phone the fire department. The truth is the government can do what it wants.

Ah yes stuff those words into my mouth!
@_date: 2017-12-30 16:59:11
There is no morality in paying taxes. If you live a country where you have to pay taxes, you have to pay taxes.

What's wrong with spreading information and making sure people don't go from the best thing that has ever happened to them to spending 5 years in jail and losing hundreds of thousands of dollars to the IRS?

Giving money makes him happy. A lot of people have to focus on money to even survive, therefore they are motivated to go to work and make money and that can sometimes be all they do if they're working 2 jobs. Everyone wants money, everyone NEEDS money. Like you said, you trade money for the things you want and people want money to trade for those things.

Just because poor people are unable to get medical help doesn't mean the rest of people don't get help.

Irrelevant but that makes me think of a weird idea of a guarantee by an exchange where they refund you for however long it takes them to send you coin kind of like the 20 minute pizza guarantee cliche

If you offer to give someone more money for taking a look into a currency that is not illegal and has changed many peoples lives for the better does that look innocent?

If they don't recognize bcash as bitcoin cash can people make a fork called bcash and confuse people even more?
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:06:34
Agreed. It wouldn't crash as bad but it would still go down a significant amount.

Realistically, if Bitcoin takes over the entire world's economy there's going to be a lot more issues than currency.
@_date: 2017-12-28 09:14:11
Bitcoin was not created to overthrow the entire worlds government. Maybe you should get off of your dimethyltryptamine and read a book or 20

You don't have to buy exactly 3 bitcoin though, and even if you did it probably wouldn't be 3 because it would cost money to send it and that would reduce the total bitcoin to less than 3.
@_date: 2017-11-24 20:37:16
I bought a steam game last year that was like $20, now that game is worth $200 and I don't even know what game it was.

You should never ever ever keep a considerable amount of dollars in an online wallet. You always want to have a wallet where you store the private key. I would suggest getting a hardware wallet.
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:20:56
I don't know, it depends on how fast you're buying it, where you're going to send it after buying it online, and how fast you want to send it there. I'd suggest not trying to go for exactly 3 bitcoin because some of the spirit of bitcoin is you can split it into so many different pieces, which is often where people get confused about it.
@_date: 2017-11-25 06:46:56
If it makes you feel any better, nobody knew it was going to takeoff. The founders didn't know, the early investors didn't know, nobody knew; it was all a gamble (And still is!!).

Seriously. Such blaring logical fallacies. Attack him on what he's doing to Bitcoin not irrelevant things he did years ago.
@_date: 2017-11-25 18:55:33
I don't understand, it is still risky! It is the definition of high risk investment. It has been changing 20-30% a day, it is STILL risky and was then too. It is/was a gamble.
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:01:25
Why? 
@_date: 2017-11-02 22:10:37
I know it's a joke and all, but you should never plug in any flash drives or hard drives to your computer if you don't know where they came from. Plenty of attacks happen this way if someone drops in a virus filled flash drive in swag bins at work events or such.

Hahaha he's not interviewing for a job I don't know how that is relevant. You're acting like people don't make mistakes. Just because he made previous mistakes doesn't make him a bad person, the things he are doing now does.
