Really? $15 worth thousands? I wouldn't be too surprised if you said a bitcoin would be worth thousands but just $15? That's insane! I'll definitely be holding on to it once I get it.

May I ask a quick question? The two most recommended wallets I see on here are electrum and blockchain. What is the difference? I've only been looking into bitcoin for a couple of days, sorry for my lack of knowledge.

How much do people estimate a BTC will be worth if the whole thing is as successful as people expect?

Thank you!

What exactly is happening when you tip someone? Are they literally rejecting a small amount of bitcoins?

Newbie here. Why would a bank close accounts that area dealing with btc? First of all, what does this even mean? That people are purchasing btc using money in the account? Second of all, how would they even know? Do they check if your transactions are going to some kind of bitcoin purchasing service or something? And lastly, why on earth would they do this?
