It is every growing, I think there would be even more stability, atleast market wise if a second currency is also widely recognized. This way we would have the freedom of mobility and higher liquidity.
@_date: 2018-01-12 14:24:00
Absolutely, we need to stop this. We have the manpower and influence to do so, so lets organize.
@_date: 2018-01-15 11:51:34
We are the verge of next explosion indeed, I can only hope that it is for the industry as whole.
@_date: 2018-01-30 07:59:32
Still not convenient for any business to operate solely on crypto.
@_date: 2018-01-04 07:52:12
Treat it as a long term investment, which for many of us is. At this point it stops being a constant occupant of your consciousness.
@_date: 2018-01-05 15:34:34
Despite it all I still use coinbase.
@_date: 2018-01-08 08:21:38
Sounds like not a quite pleasant experience. Sorry to hear it.
@_date: 2018-01-19 14:35:00
One of every 7 people in the world is Indian too. Have thought about it.
@_date: 2018-01-29 08:59:17
Its like straight out of those 90s action movies.

Microsoft didn't really drop Bitcoin, read about it. They ask you to charge your account first, which could be made with bitcoin, and then you can purchase. It is a way to put the transaction costs on the customers end, and not ask of Microsoft to retain wallets, because if money are kept in bitcoin it is not as liquid or as cost efficient. That's all there is to it. 
@_date: 2018-01-25 09:06:51
Its not money laundering, you could still declare It as an income from crypto  currency investment, and pay your taxes for it, but you will not be having to prove a huge transaction.
@_date: 2018-01-24 09:58:05
You will be having quite a few problems, and you will have to prove quite a lot on origin. I am sorry but best way is to do it off shore. And later transfer back on small wires.

In a way the current price is a bubble, because it grew exponentially due to the already present growth. We are about to see the bubble burst soon, this means that the high demand will seize to pump prices up and they would simply normalize a bit downward. Ands that's it. No one is losing all their savings, no one is going to have to file for bankruptcy etc. Its just the way a free market works.
@_date: 2017-12-26 09:54:38
I think that was a pump and dump but not from outside the bitcoin community, but from certain people who created bitcoin(if you know what I mean). We will see what happens now soon enough, but I predict a recovery.
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:22:44
True, this fanatism I too recognize is producing such large amount of demand for the , again correctly said - commodity, that prices are pumped mainly due to it.
@_date: 2017-12-04 08:06:23
The higher the diversity, the better higher the competition, which leads to better and  cheaper services.
@_date: 2017-12-18 15:19:57
It is not a FUD, most people are sure that Bitcoin is still I a stage of growth, which means that hedging for a risk of drop is actually not needed.
@_date: 2017-12-05 07:46:16
At the point of lacking any information of whats to come, any action is considered rational. Only after time passes and you know the outcome you start feeling sorry for missed chances , but you should not! Not knowing something in the first place is not a chance at all, and If you end up gaining something out of such situation it is all up to your luck and nothing else. Its the same as winning the lottery. So stop your sorrow, man up and realize that those things are just smoke and mirrors.
@_date: 2017-12-12 08:40:43
The best way is to hedge your risk. With cryptos id say you can diversify with some other crypto like ETH for example, and you could read a bit about futures and reducing your risk with them eventually.
@_date: 2017-12-19 08:45:02
Lol, I wish I could go through a worm hole, in a system close to  a black hole, stay in orbit for a while, and come back, be a billionaire and have a space station named after me. All shall love me and despair. HODL
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:14:10
This is not a crash guys, from where I come from, we call this an opportunity.
@_date: 2017-12-08 08:44:01
As a matter of fact it really is gambling, because it is pure speculation, but calling it a bubble Is just pure ignorance. It is a commodity, depending its price purely on free market economy, which is the purest form of price determination, there is nothing else other than supply and demand that defines just how much a bitcoin should cost. This is not a bubble, in our age of regulations, I call this a luxury.
@_date: 2017-12-11 08:43:16
I just love the fanatic nature of people involved into Bitcoin. It truly is the force that it pumping prices up.
@_date: 2017-12-18 16:17:57
Absolutely agree with you. If regulations are implemented, they 100% must not be invasive.
@_date: 2017-12-06 07:19:22
That would be insane, but yes- lets do it. I have very little left until i can afford my yacht.
@_date: 2017-12-08 08:50:00
I like to call it min-maxing. I.E. minimizing risk for maximized profit, but I have to agree with you - yes it is. But there are different types of gambling. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 13:10:45
As far as I know, people prefer it as a tool to short bitcoin, rather than hedging risk.
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:39:11
that's just a pump and dump move toward the bcash, and very soon people will see it happen.
@_date: 2017-12-21 09:15:37
Id sell a portion down to my initial investment. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 09:53:16
Investing without any idea of what you are doing is the same as playing the lottery. Don't be stupid reduce your risk to the least that's possible.
@_date: 2017-11-03 15:04:11
Technically if enough people do it, they would lose money for the transactions, but they could increase the demand so much that the price to actually increase. But it is all a theory and requires a lot of effort with little to not direct earnings.
@_date: 2017-11-02 10:34:01
It is rather unknown, but after every peak, there is a slight fall, so very soon there should be a small dip. You could wait for it. But you will need to be very fast because a lot of people are waiting for it, thus the prices will come back up quite swiftly.
@_date: 2017-11-14 08:24:38
People should express their desires, because it is only through people's spoken needs that we eventually find the golden mean.
@_date: 2017-11-13 09:41:17
The risks involved in just any other commodity investment. Yes I said commodity. As contrary to common sense Bitcoin has trends more similar to gold than regular fiat currencies. It is a market driven all by the demand for the commodity, thus there is not much else that backs it up. With this said it is a very volatile market, but one that manages to regain loss in value in record breaking times. The lack of regulation is a controversial topic, because it increases risk of crash but it also increases the recovery rates. Do your deep research and come to your conclusions, and based on that decide on what you want to do with your capital. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 07:47:10
With all that volatility it would be very hard to implement Bitcoin as  an everyday trading mean. I know smart people will come to figure things out and eventually we will have it all, I just cant see it yet. That's why we need visionaries.
@_date: 2017-11-08 09:48:54
It depends on how much you feel like working with i.e. risking. But for an investment to have a considerable hypothetical impact, the  law states - More is more.
@_date: 2017-11-16 11:07:37
Thanks for sharing.
@_date: 2017-11-07 10:35:30
Well it is a though answer, for there is concrete proof of what would happen. But there was a pretty good philosophy of keeping 50% invested and liquidating the rest if you feel venturous.
@_date: 2017-11-23 09:58:56
That's rather interesting, congrats mate on your purchase!
@_date: 2017-11-01 09:54:34
Depends on how much you can invest, but $100 is a good amount to start with. Try understanding the principle of crypto.
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:32:53
That's insane, It will be in history books in 20-30 years form now.
@_date: 2017-11-24 10:01:35
Regulation should be inposed only to prevent fraudulent activities, after that leave it be the free market it is.
@_date: 2017-11-17 09:06:50
It would be a huge risk, if you happen to come out of it with a massive profit its just pure luck. Its just a tremendous speculation right now, so invest - yes, but all in- no.
@_date: 2017-11-22 09:01:22
Sparks a society of unaware conformism. 
@_date: 2017-10-28 09:19:06
It wont crash, but rather develop even more. The reason China blocked ICO, just think about it - decentralized  crowdfunding operating in a communistic state? It just doesn't coop. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 09:19:50
Unfortunately they can't, but don't worry I hear that real estate on the California Coast is plentiful.
@_date: 2017-10-26 07:32:04
Good job on the successful investment, but remember that the higher the reward it usually involves even higher risks. Try balancing between the optimal amount of risk you can afford and the most reward you take out of. The highest risk you can afford should never be the optimal amount of money you can invest, but rather that highest price you can pay, which in case of a bad investment - it wont hurt your other ventures. And in case you feel lucky and want to play big, then don't forget to diversify. 
An infinitely long streak of good investments is denied by a single bankruptcy.
@_date: 2017-10-26 08:20:08
In that case I could only advice you to take a look at the crowdfunding campaigns, and you would have yourself a solid venture portfolio. Keep up and strive for perfection.
@_date: 2017-10-25 13:08:13
It just as with any investment: high risk - big reward/ low risk - small reward. The trick is to balance it in between the risk you are willing to take and the highest reward possible. This requires regularity in investment when uncertain (this helps in reducing the short term risk with relative good reward), and singularity in investment when you happen to have some intel or simply feel like gambling.
In other words invest a little every day and you are better off than simply losing it all on a bad investment day.
@_date: 2017-10-31 10:18:29
My advice to you would be to read some forums concerning first time buying, it depends on how much you are willing to buy; what currency; whether or not you are planning on investing your crypto in an ICO for example etc. Read some more on the topic and decide what you want to do with your money. Try buying some small amount at first.
