Banks are constantly spending your deposits on various financial instruments to make money. Could be equities, bonds, derivatives, whatever. The riskier the better, because they make more yield, and if it gets too risky they now just expect the Federal Treasury to step in and bail them out... 
Because of all that spending they have entire after-hours teams dedicated to making sure that the fractional reserve quota is met every night. They do this by lending out collateral (like bonds) to other banks, for a certain percentage interest that they pay back the next day. The Fed gives a "target rate" that banks should use when lending among others, but really it's a market and the buyers/sellers decide what rates to use. 
If there aren't enough loaners at the target rate, then banks can't lend their collateral out. There's not enough cash being offered in the market, in other words a lack of liquidity. So banks have to ask for a loan at a HIGHER rate of interest, meaning they have to pay back more the next day.  Since there isn't enough liquidity, in order to force the market rate back down to the "target", the Fed has to step in and offer up cash at the target rate on the taxpayers' dime. Quantitative Easing. But even with all this QE, banks are STILL having trouble getting the cash they need. That's why the repurchase operations (repos) are still straining and in some cases oversubscribed. There's still more demand than supply, and so the Fed has been forced to increase its QE limits even more. The real question is WHY aren't other banks lending to each other?

Hardly surprising - the UK press are not entirely well versed on the bitcoin space (or anything related to free speech for that matter...) . Much like the Guardian writers who invested at $19k then started saying bitcoin is a scam in 2018, it is sheer ignorance and lack of intellectual depth in the subject matter (some deliberate manipulation as well probably). I think the public will be annoyed with the current press coverage of bitcoin in 5 years time, when most of them are priced out and the UK once again displays entitlement in the age of intellectual capitalism. At least bitcoin is meritocratic in this sense.

You should have a plan in place with regards to taking profits, as there is always a substantial correction (probably to \~$25k after the next top).
You should NOT sell all of your BTC, but you should diversify at the euphoric top (probably 2021).
Remember: when it hits $100k, it becomes more likely that it will indeed hit $1mm in the next decade.
