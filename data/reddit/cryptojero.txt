Yes that would be great. That you have a wallet app with all options and can pay with just a tap (and with biometrics above 30$)

Does the TenX card convert the BtC into fiat first and then pay the merchant?

That’s cool.

I would say not even the step with confirm or cancel. Just tap-and-go with amounts up until 30$ and above that confirm with device biometrics (face id or fingerprint) what do you think?

It would be cool if you can do payments up to 0.01 BTC for instance with just tapping the nfc. And amounts above that with biometrics to identify the wallet owner

True, just an example. I think contactless payments via Apple / Google pay is still easier than transferring Bitcoin though
@_date: 2019-12-11 20:05:43
Could you give examples? Is there applications that can do a payment in bitcoin to a merchant with just 1 tap?

If anyone know something about this please share it here. Sounds cool

Yes I don’t think QR codes or the addresses have to dissappear, but with all the latest fintech thats out there, Bitcoin’s UX is simply not the best when it comes to payments. It was to be a tap and go thing in stores. Otherwise people (in western countries at least) will still prefer to use apple pay or card taps

Would it be possible now already to design an application whereby the addresses of both parties are processed in a contactless payment?

But when is it actually finished and possible being used in daily life? Mass adoption is needed, otherwise it is only a store of value
