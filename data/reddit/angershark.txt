They're also shelter from the elements, a place to store items you own, a place to sleep, a place to shit and piss in private, etc etc.

A rewarding nightmare once you get things how you want them.

damn, the line about building a rig like a BP engineer was pretty crafty.

Lol you're clueless of what results oriented thinking even is. It's not ignoring potential expected value. It's basing future decisions on the outcome of an event that's already occurred in spite of expected value. But feel free to keep derping on.
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:12:32
They're also not called "tulips". Weakest analogy in the history of tulipcoin, amirite?
@_date: 2017-12-12 14:23:57
The results-oriented thinking is strong with you. Which is bad, very bad.
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:26:51
Yeah it will. What are you buying that $1m won't get you much of?
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:09:31
I can still tell you have no clue wtf you're talking about. I'm just glad I can help point out that you don't know wtf you're talking about.
@_date: 2017-12-14 06:29:42
It's okay to admit you don't know wtf you're talking about. Nobody cares.

These notebooks are amazing. I almost don't want to write in mine because then it won't be as perfect...
The more affordable Canadian shipping is excellent, btw!
@_date: 2014-08-26 19:21:41
Thanks! I'll check out some of their offerings and see what stands out :)

If you click the btc symbol to the right of Add to Cart you get taken to the Bitpay checkout page (where the 10% discount will be applied automatically). Don't eat those things!

I think it's just $1.00, at least with Scotiabank

OP says he's in Canada.
Do you mind sharing the bank you use(d) and what city you're in?
@_date: 2014-06-05 22:26:53
They already have mobile payments for parking meters in Vancouver (and I'm sure elsewhere) using an app called PayByPhone. It's actually quite convenient. It even texts you when your time is going to expire and you can easily top up.
How would btc make this better?

No Starbucks employee has ever given a shit when I point my phone towards the app reader. Not a particularly far advancement to tap my phone.
@_date: 2014-08-15 19:58:46
This is really the only way I could think you could even start, and it seems insanely inaccurate:
Total volume of coins mined
Total volume of wallets
Country breakdown from a site like [Bitcoin Charts](
and calculating from that 2% for Canadian volume to get:
- 260,000 coins
- 80,000 wallets
- $130 million dollars
held by Canadians...maybe I should add a +/- of oh, $100 million :(

So then op is saying don't buy right now and wait for a "real" dip?
@_date: 2018-06-29 13:21:59
Nah, I'd rather directly translate your statement as it pertains to OPs statement of "buy the dip". 
@_date: 2019-02-26 15:32:04
"...donate to the IRS ANY TIME" is not worth an argument, it deserves only ridicule.
@_date: 2017-11-27 15:22:40
TIL 500 quid = 75k
@_date: 2019-02-26 13:47:06
Is this your actual logic? One of the dumbest things I've ever read here.
@_date: 2017-11-04 14:02:00
No she won't. She has a career that she's known for and will continue to be known for.
@_date: 2017-11-27 16:30:01
Heh, no prob - tbh, I'm a bit embarrassed that I didn't see where you came up with 75k.
@_date: 2017-11-27 16:09:04
I see, you're reading it as he bought 150 coins at 500 quid EACH. That's not what I took it as, I take it he bought 150 coins for 500 quid TOTAL.

Why do you keep linking to this? The karma has been taken, you missed out. Be glad karma can't take you to the moon.

Had a goal, reached the goal. Well done, sir/ma'am.
@_date: 2019-02-26 16:44:24
Ok, here I'll bullet point this for you since you want to die on this hill of someone else's stupid comment:
-the IRS isn't a charity, you don't "donate" to it, and furthermore, such "donations" would not be distributed out to the good people of America as charitable distribution
-the "great humanitarian", sarcastically stated, has actually donated billions of dollars to actual charities. How much? Upwards of $40 Billion. 
-voluntarily contributing more in taxes would not make any change in policy, that extra money would likely simply be returned in the form of a refund at the end of tax season. You seem to be confusing "gift" and "tax contribution" as synonymous when they most certainly are not.
Now I've wasted even more time on arguing with someone who didn't even make the argument to begin with. Good day.

Yes, I'm Lily Allen and my job now is to point out hyperbole on Reddit. It's what I'll forever be known for.
@_date: 2017-11-18 04:13:35
Or just delete your post. But whatever.
@_date: 2018-03-19 03:12:12




Nope, no assumptions about motivation or attacks on character and/or authority here. There are other examples in your post but you can have fun finding them yourself (or deny everything, up to you).
@_date: 2018-03-18 21:52:48
You just proved his point.
@_date: 2018-03-19 01:09:07
Yes, ad hominem attacks definitely help your point.
