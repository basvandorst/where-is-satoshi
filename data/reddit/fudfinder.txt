Not great timing for the company.
They were/are in the middle of a fund raise.
Anyway, good luck and hope you find the attack vector.

It could be. But then again, they were blatantly violating securities laws. So which is more likely?

The email headers look legitimate.
BTW you blacked out your email everywhere except one place in the screenshot.

/dev in linux is traditionally the directory with files that represent devices like hard drives, mouse etc.
I don't get the connection what the wallet has to do with /dev?
Maybe they're trying to say it's for developers? "dev" -&gt; developers? If so, I recommend changing the blog post title because it's making the company look a bit clueless to their supposed target audience.

There have been some reports of a hack over the past week. **Coinkite -- true of false?**

In terms of adoption: there isn't anything you can do with bitcoin that is legal-and-useful. (there is plenty that is illegal-and-useful and legal-and-useless).

LOL. Do you even know how web sites work?

ACH - yes.
KYC - same as other US companies.

So does every bitcoin company that also deals with fiat.
They may not say it explicitly but have you tried buying some bitcoin while using a VPN service? Unlikely to succeed.
Fraud is a problem on the fiat side which forces things like this.
EDIT: Yes, I now get that article is about something else.

WTF -- site filled with referral links to Coinbase. "Unbiased". This is shit.

Is this open to Americans? Did we already forget CFTC's recent crackdown?

They are actually used to receive change. Change in a transaction. Let's say you spend 1 btc, but you're inputs are 1.3 btc, 0.3 goes to change address you control.
Privacy/security are not the design concerns AFAIK.

Abra &amp; Launch; sorry but I've heard those two words together wayy too many times.

I for one am more cautious. There has been so much hype but I'm still waiting to see if anything useful comes out.

Bitcoin transaction inputs don't come from addresses. They come from unspent outputs (which can have many associated addresses). So there is no 'source address' to send change to.

Is there anything odd in your background that would trigger some flags?
