Classic fallacy. ❤️������
Bitcoin will be a transfer of wealth. Those who hold Bonds and Cash will get anihilated due to currency depreciation... the wealth will transfer out of the fiat system and into alternative currencies (Bitcoin &amp; Gold). ��
In this world, there is inflation which eats away at the cash every year.
How? Well I’ll tell you how;
Eventually every country will go to currency battles with each other to try pay off their debt, the citizens will OPT OUT of the nation by using Bitcoin to store and pay
Why? Because the volatility of your own country’s currency relative to another may be too vicious. For example, what if Aussie Dollar v Euro gets stronger too much but the Aussie v Yen crashes? These have implications for exporters, tourists, no coincels.
����‍�� I hope you have your space suit ready because our next mission is to the MOON!

Coinomi had a bug in their desktop wallet app... the 24-word passphrase was sent to Google for a spell-check.
Link:  [
**This vulnerability only affected PC users who restored from a previous existing seed. You mentioned that you moved your stuff over.**
I don't know how these faggot nerds were able to monitor and grab the words from Google but they did. ��
They have since fixed the issue and obviously denied everything. Look if I could give you any advice, it's to double-down on your investment. Try to buy 1.0 BTC (or even 2.0 BTC) and HODL for 2-3 years. You will be make it back. Don't let this get you down. If you're selling BTC at $100k USD or hodling for true power to $200k-400k USD... it will all be worth it.
Good luck friend

We all want this but the problem is that the exchanges gobble and suck on algorithm + HFT people. These scum vultures are the ones coding spoofing, quote stuffing and other poisonous tactics into their programs. They abuse it to the highest degree because they pay off the exchanges (even CME and ICE and NYSE etc.)... you can’t fight their bribes...
They are the lowest of low. The bottom of the barrel. They contribute nothing and all algo people are usually “secretive” and browse forums but contribute nothing because they just steal stuff for themselves.
Unfortunately these losers all generate volume and activity for the exchange (more money) at the expense of worse trading experiences and costs for retailers and human traders.

❤️������ Bitcoin is the hardest money that we have ever seen. It is the most sound and scarce thing we have ever invented as humans.
In the long run, the hard money wins.
In the 1870’s a big war between Gold and Silver happened. Volatility battles happened. Guess who won? Gold did, because Silver was easier to mine.
�� 
I could go on but I’d rather not. Denying Bitcoin’s chance to get to $1 million usd is like saying that the Internet has no purpose because humans will always value social interaction in person.
Guess what? We don’t.
We make decisions that are efficient and convenient and useful. And guess what, the hardest digital money so happens to be decentralized, borderless and open in the right amount to capture the world in the next 10 years.
To the moon! ��

Hi friends. Andreas Antonopolous made a similar comment.
**He said that "The most remarkable thing was Bitcoin getting to $1.00 USD in the first place"**
The power of this... is in the reality that we could create a Digital Form of Currency that acheived parity with the U.S. Dollar.
In 50 years the Wikipedia will probably quote the "Bitcoin hitting Parity with World Reserve Currency $1.00 USD" as being the ultimate hallmark of its Birth.

This is the bottom of the bear market.
Everyone has disappeared and they are scared. Bizonacci is long gone, and more exchanges are ready to do more exit scams.
Buy more Bitcoin and hodl. ❤️

Please go back and find my comments from Jan/Feb 2019 when I told everyone to buy at $4k because we’re rocketing.
This technology is far too superior and revolutionary such that the network effect will push Bitcoin to new heights with every rally we have.
We are in Bearish times right now but you know what, Bitcoin loves to grab Bears from behind the neck and fuck them in the ass

2020 here we come

Nah dude I used to trade bonds and equity spreads, I know exactly how the game works inside and out. 
Bitcoin is not dictated by the futures market for too long. ��
There is limited supply to be gobbled up by real investors. When the spot exchanges are chewed up (Coinbase, Bitstamp, Krakken etc.) then CME has no choice but to follow.
I am watching the CME very closely and it’s price action every day is not a leader. ❤️
When the market makers get hit and hedge across the other exchange books, you’ll never see Bitmex and Binance immediately flash to CME’s price area for that long.
@_date: 2019-12-06 01:33:56
On a day-trading perspective, I watch most of the exchanges on a 1-minute chart and I am aggressively trading off the Orderbook. I see all the volume and flows enter and exit the market. I can tell when Bitmex is following Binance, or everyone is following a big liquidation in Bitstamp, for example. When the CME gaps are created they don't carry much weight, there is a push by **Deribit + Bitmex** market makers to match CME but they are always stopped by walls on Binance &amp; other spot exchanges when the **real spot BTC** order blocks are sitting there and acting as support or resistance. ��
Most of the time, though, it's all about price-discovery. If the market really wants to go down, it will go down. And vice versa. Sometimes we get caught up in who is leading, e.g. "Okex has a buyer" but in reality, the market just wants to head that way. These exchanges just provide a catalyst to our eyes because they are thin. In traditional exchanges they are much more fluid and centralized (e.g. trading S&amp;P500 futures on the CME).
But it gets more interesting in the future... ✡
You have to remember that Bitcoin's protocol and applications are being built around it which will deeply incentivise people to own Bitcoin (and Ethereum) and use them on the network. ��
I cannot give specific examples, except Staking, because these utilities and innovations have not been built yet. If they had been built, the Price would already be $250,000 and growing. ��
So for now you have to trust that *the people who really want to buy Bitcoin, will go to spot exchanges and own a Bitcoin on the network, by themselves*. 
Right now, a lot of the flashy Bear market stuff is revolving around exchanges and leveraged trading. So its understandable that the binoculars can only see this horizon. ��
But if you use a telescope, you'll come to the conclusion that people will have to rush to the same door, to grab spot Bitcoin, and participate in the protocol. And when this happens, you can try to "slam" the CME or Bakkt's fake futures all you want, but you will be overwhelmed and your account will be flattened in no time. ��

Don’t sell until 150-180k

If you spent 5-minutes doing some research for yourself you would find out that **competition is what generates the future strength of Bitcoin**. The more competitive coins there are coming onto the market, the better the chance that Bitcoin has of adopting its best features. Its like a blackhole that just sucks out the sweet juice from everything around it.
**Bitcoin grows stronger because of the competitive nature of its rivals.**
*Example*: Mimblewimble protocol can be incorporated into Bitcoin if it needs to.
We want people to keep trying to create a better Bitcoin because they will stumble upon better code, marketing, technology, practical applications... you can piece the puzzle together now :)

The market priced in this issue many years ago. It’s forward looking. 
Adoption of Cryptos (especially Bitcoin) is growing every week and there’s only 18 million coins in circulation (much less after removing the Genesis account and lost coins).
Mt. Gox being hacked could only be matched by Bitfinex going under. But even if it did, it’s nowhere near as big proportionally as Mt. Gox in 2013-2014
@_date: 2019-01-23 15:35:21
The Winkevoss prediction of $320k per coin is arrived at by assuming Bitcoin replaces Gold in market cap ($7 trillion)
As of Jan 2019, Bitcoin’s market cap $60 bln needs to grow by 116 times to equal Gold market cap of $7 trln.
Rough estimates are between $300k-$400k

This is an amazing post. Thankyou for contributing. Most of my content contribution is actually re-gurgitating what Andreas says during Bubble Times, but since most people are offside they can’t think rationally.
I hope people hodl and don’t panic sell until way beyond 2019.

This picture is from the 2014/2015 bull market phase ending.
It is when Mt. Gox got hacked.
Bitcoin dropped 87% from its High ($1150) down to $150.
Note that Mt Gox did 80% of the world’s Bitcoin transaction volume at the time. It was a mega, mega blow.
Those faggots who say we are going to $1k - $1.8k are effectively saying we are going to drop 92-95% from our high. This would be a never-before-seen type of crash for Buttcoin.
Maybe if Bitfinex blew up we could get that low... But as far as I can see, this market has way too many fundamental strengths to justify such a vicious retracement. Wallet numbers are growing at 6% week, the countries of Venezuela and Argentina are etching deeper into a full blown Currency Depression, and Bitcoin adoption is spreading by the day.
Note that 87% down from $20,000 is a price of $2,600.
FINAL WARNING: Faggots who claim we are going to $1k region are the same faggots who said we were going to bust $100k in 2018 January.
These losers are the FOMO sellers. They are the Bear version of the FOMO buyers.
Historically, FOMO sellers miss their chance to accumulate near bottoms because they keep trying to be a sick cunt and pick the absolute lows.

In 1994 those same kids had no chance of understanding how to use Windows to send an e-mail but today there are Uber drivers in Rio who are making a living driving a taxi.
You don’t need to explain anything - once they hear of a family member saving 15% of their wages by using cryptos to transfer money back home, they will ask to learn or be forced to learn. 
Try google “why the internet will fail” articles from the early 90’s.

I recently had my Number ported over via a scam.
The only way to prevent this is to call up your Telco and put in a password with your number. You can attach a pass code so that no-one can ever steal your number over.
After I did this, the scamming faggots tried to steal my number again but they failed. My telco company told me it’s now safe.
Prior to this, there was no password. Anyone with an ID and details can steal a number over.
