So if I had 2btc and sent away 1btc which was unconfirmed then I should try to send 2btc to a new address in my wallet?

I've upgraded to the newest one but I was using an electrum wallet that must have been 2 years old. Just never upgraded since It never had any issue's.
I checked blockr.io just there and nothing is found. So should I just wait for the 3 days to make sure or am I safe to carry on with the assumption that it's not going to get conformed?
Out of curiosity what's so bad about that rejection reason?

Electrum updated to it's newest version.

When you say I should spend a transaction with the same coin how do I go about doing that? I was assuming that if let's say I have 2btc, then 1 btc is rejected but unconfirmed, if I now sent 1btc it would be from the remaining btc not from the rejected unconfirmed 1 btc.

Thanks you've given me at least a good pointer in what direction to search on google. 
You've been a great help.

No worries but you've been very helpful. Thanks.

Any idea what would have caused it then?
@_date: 2016-06-15 17:07:22
Ok so I get the logic. Next step would be is there a way to speed it up so electrum can forget the transaction that's never going to get confirmed? I know after 3 days it will eventually realise (so I've been told).

Thanks that's reinsuring.

So probably because I was using an old wallet that I never updated.
