Bit-X card has 
Cash withdrawal at ATM	0.01 BTC	+ 3% fee
+ a lot of other fees (+ currency conversion fee).
I'll give you an example
if you go to Switzerland for holidays and would like to use Bit-X card (if it works) and get some CHF(Swiss Franc) in ATM - you will pay 0.01 BTC	+ 3% (nanocard fee) + 3% (ccy conversion fee) =
6% + 0.01 BTC.
and even if you don't use it you have to pay 0.05 BTC monthly

@_date: 2015-04-06 17:41:39
"It takes 3 Business days (excluding weekends) for a load request to appear on your bank card" - doesn't look too good
 converts your bitcoins to fiat instantly 
@_date: 2015-09-08 19:30:21
every card has FX fee, it's even mentioned on their website. try to buy anything denominated in USD and you'll see FX fee.
btw: what will happen with your bitcoin balance if you lost the card and somebody has access to it? no multisig or 2-factor will protect your coins.

thanks for comment.
a question - have you ever loaded your card on e-coin? you just ordered it and never used, right?
if you never used it and xapo doesn't show you the rate (you only see it post factum), could you please elaborate how you calculated the discrepancy in rates?
what I meant by the phrase you quoted is that when you are accusing somebody, who is well known on the market and have thousands of clients, in hiding anything, it would be nice that you can prove it. Different services have different models  , rate fluctuates during the day, order books are different - but looks like you believe that you know what the true rate is and all other services should follow it and if they don't, they probably hiding something. Have you tried to analyse rate on different exchanges and search for "hidden" charges there as well?
Once again, E-Coin doesn't have any hidden fees, all fees are mentioned on the website and you get exact amount is shown on the screen - nothing is hidden.
@_date: 2015-10-01 07:51:48
$300 limit might work for some people,but if you need higher limits check [E-Coin](
@_date: 2015-10-04 18:06:48
what's your fee on ATM withdrawal?
@_date: 2015-10-04 19:42:42
do they mention on their website that you can withdraw only 75% of funds? so if you want to buy $1000 tv on Amazon you will need $1333 - just curious what do you think about it? Also how about 3% ATM withdrawal fee and 5% FX fees if you don;t want to upload your docs straight away. Ah yes - inactivity fee, monthly fee, name embossing fees...
@_date: 2015-10-04 18:04:01
[E-Coin]( is the best option at the moment: virtual or plastic cards, 3 currencies, the highest limits, the best customer service
@_date: 2015-10-04 19:12:23
E-Coin doesn't hide any fees, you get exact amount of fiat you see on your screen (when loading card), all fees are mentioned here [Fees&amp;Liimits]( . Not quite sure why you are trying to use Bitstamp rate as definitive source of BTC/GBP, BTC/EUR rate, neither E-Coin nor Xapo work with Bitstamp, so please stop misleading people here and accusing well-known services 
@_date: 2015-10-04 19:14:42
hey bit-x guy, we had a lot of discussions in other topics - but you keep trying to promote your service everywhere e-coin or xapo mentioned. 
bit-x charges 3% on atm withdrawal, user can withdral only 75% of funds, so stop even comparing your service with market leaders like Xapo and E-Coin
@_date: 2015-10-09 06:29:45
there were several issue with MyChoice bank backend, so the card loading was effected. It was resolved and it's working very smooth now 
@_date: 2015-03-26 07:19:08
@_date: 2015-10-04 18:05:18
you forgot to mention 3% fee and that you can spend only 75% of your balance, so what the point in cashback - if they charge you for everything
@_date: 2015-10-04 19:29:04
E-Coin show you exact amount you will get on your card, you can also see the rate - what is hidden here? Xapo on the other hand never shows shows you the rate, you only can see it post factum. So following your Bitstamp example could you please elaborate BTC/EUR and BTC/GBP rate for E-Coin - and how much do you think they are hiding there. Also have you ever heard about order depth and how it might effect rate?
@_date: 2015-10-04 19:20:13
ah just checked on your website
Currency conversion***
5% - lol, guys it's madness, so atm withdrawal witll cost 8% for end user withdrawing cash in different currency
@_date: 2015-03-25 22:34:27
