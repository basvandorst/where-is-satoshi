I agree. this is what I have seen. hence I make it a point to back up before they start using the wallet.

This is a shame they are not selling more. Any word on when or link for information.

we noticed that... it was the one wallet during our demos that worked. dare i say flawlessly. Which is why we now list it first in our demos
As a notation I notices a bug when you view transaction detail. every other time i went to view a specific transaction the miner fee showed up as either .0003 or .34
Contact us further if you guys would like to work together. we have experience working with under banked and they seem a little more niche. With a few tweaks your platform will be top notch.

it would be more productive to actually pay sex workers rather than waste their time answering another message in their inbox. 
When customers are willing to pay in bitcoin, then you will see market forces move them to actually accepting it from customers. For now, their needs are more for purchasing advertising.

Multiple people using a common account. We are still sorting out how to handle communication. The other comment is not intended to be confrontational. Hope we are still good.

Obviously you did not watch our talk or look over the materials. We talk extensively about the wallets.
Specifically Airbitz was the one we were leaning to.

Bitcoin's volatility can certainly be a shortcoming for all kinds of transactions. Something to always factor in.

Thanks for pointing out the missing m!

Yes, plenty of bitcoiners are sex workers. Does that come as a surprise to you? 
@_date: 2015-07-20 02:32:32
i glossed over the "stress test" for them and told them to avoid breadwallet because of the hard coded miner fee that is too low.
What is needed is auto-scaling fee... but with an override option for custom. 
That however is a debate and a talk not to be had with new people. they just want something that works.

Thanks for your feedback, Inara! It's great to connect with you. We do talk about volatility a fair bit in the presentation, focusing on using it as a tool not a investment. We will put a bit more emphasis on it next time. Thanks for your input - keep in touch!
P.S. Inara is one of my favorite fictional characters - Firefly!

First of all, that quote is made up - never said anywhere. 
But secondly, I'm about ready to kick your ignorant little ass. I think that will have to do for now. 
@_date: 2015-07-20 02:18:50
yes. when you go to pay. you click on "bitcoin" as the option and a qr is displayed. 
on your phone wallet. click send, then scan.

Thanks for the other notes on cold storage and paper wallets. We talk about it, and we'll emphasize it some more in upcoming trainings. And yes, bitcoin has a lot of great uses for sex workers asserting their financial self-determination. Many sex workers were quite quick to jump on this early on. 
Sex worker feminism. It's a thing. And yeah, it's financial too, because sex work is work - and feminism is not for just one gender. The "feminist" activism is not about being "already empowered" as sex workers, since clearly there are many problems that we are struggling against. It's about working towards better conditions and changing these existing problems. The sex workers who are most fiercely organized around fighting existing problems are not the North American "happy hooker feminists," a strawman trope often used to discredit "privileged" sex workers as being "unrepresentative" of the ones who are working in worse conditions. Actually, the best organized and most politically effective sex worker activists are the ones working in the worst conditions in India (&lt;a href = " 650,000 sex workers &lt;/a&gt; who have created their own credit union and retirement programs), Thailand and Cambodia (who have organized together to pass laws to fight human trafficking, violence, and exploitation in their trades) - as well as some immigrants and street-based people in the sex trades who are the most marginalized in first world countries. The fact that these people are interested in the potential of Bitcoin for accessing BP ads, improving safety, anonymity, and better control over their work - and that **these** are the people actively seeking and organizing trainings for Bitcoin - is in itself, a promising example of "sex worker feminism," strength, and resourcefulness.
This presentation has a feminist bend because at least two of the people leading it are sex worker feminists. You can disagree with the politics, and choose to see it without a gendered angle, but bitcoin has many underlying political values, including the ones you expressed. You can insist on keeping this a "neutral" topic about financial censorship only, and not about gender, but we believe the reason that this work is censored is because of sexism, prudish values rooted in marriage (eg historic male ownership of their wives' bodies as property and asymmetrical requirements of "chastity"), as well as a general lack of respect for one of the ways that women have always supported themselves financially.
Agreed: these points hold regardless of sex/gender - there are also plenty of sex workers who are not cis-women. Hopefully Tony's slideshow is useful, regardless of politics. However, given the nature of this very passionate and dedicated team, it would be inappropriate to repress the values felt so strongly by the organizers.
Thanks also for your note about Pax. It's important for us that our work is sex-worker-led and has support from the sex worker community, rather than a condescending and presumptuous project from the outside. It's great to get helpful feedback from other bitcoin users, but we of course prioritize the feedback from sex workers themselves, and try to ensure that our in-person workshops are spaces free of stigma and condescension.
P.S. This training is an **example** of sex worker intersectional feminism. And there are many many more examples of it around the world:

yep. covered that in the talk

Circle was listed and mentioned.
bitcoinpaperwallets.com not a great place to direct them. We are trying to teach good security habits. Some of them may know how to use Tails OS but we cant teach all of them. 
Mycelium entropy was ideal. I am a big fan of paper wallets. So I hope another production run is done soon. Or perhaps another company produce an similar device. These workers understood the security concerns without being spoon fed, and were immediately sold on buying such a device for the piece of mind.

I do go over paper wallets. however having them do a linux live disc is not practical.
Never have I seen a group though  that understood the situation better. 9/10 spring for a mycelium entropy without hesitation.
I have been giving these talks a long time and this demographic gets it and is willing to invest in the simple security
