Someone is paying to run that server. You're assuming they won't come after you. The guy that gave you that pc can link back to you. There can only have been so many developers on that project. I wouldn't bank on being invulnerable to detection.
Otherwise all power to you man.
You should follow back on those addresses, if they're sending you the right amount they probably all got funded from the same account or transaction at some stage at similar times. It wouldn't be hard to figure out by analysing the transaction history on the block chain should lead back to an original transaction that has lots of transactions to accounts with the same amount of inactivity as the accounts you received from.

This works if Antpool has the most money to make by maximizing their BTC profit from mining. 
The owners of Antpool have a greater incentive to get people to use BCash instead of Bitcoin. They are enormously invested in BCash having bought up a masive stake in the altcoin. They would also prefer to be able to use the ASICBoost they have built into their Antminer hardware which no longer works on Bitcoin since segwit was implemented.
It's a pretty grey area really.

If the shop isn't paying me, and I spend my $100 with the shop what's my incentive to settle up to the blockchain? 
If I spend the $100 and I want to "top up" my channel do I have to close the old one and open a brand new one?
If I close my channel, does the shop have to close the channel with the car cleaner?
If a shop is a major node in the network and they need to close hundreds of thousands or millions of channels (think walmart or something) wouldn't that swamp the bitcoin network with transactions driving up the transaction price astronomically?
Can channel fees be withdrawn without closing a channel?
Does opening a each channel have to be it's own Bitcoin transaction?
If you were to get paid in fiat and buy Bitcoin you'd have to close and reopen your channel each pay to spend it in the LN correct?

What's your objective, to maximise short term gains, to maximize long term gains, to retire early, to overthrow the banking cartels, to buy a nice pair of shoes, to store your wealth out of reach of corrupt government?
The answer to your question depends on your incentives.
Personally I'm shooting for early retirement, so I have a humble target that will enable that. Once I get close I'll lock in those long term gains. I started buying in 2013, rode the dip from 1100 till 300 and back up.

To short BTC on an exchange you borrow BTC from a lender (possible leveraged up to 100x), then sell it all. If a lot of people do this all the sells drive the price down to a point that it starts triggering peoples stop losses that cascades and can crash the market. Once crashed they buy back the same amount of bitcoin and pay back the lender pocketing the difference.
If the market has just had a meteoric rise and people expect a correction they are more likely to sell at the first sign of a dip as well compounding the situation.
Now please explain to me how shorting on a futures market is different from shorting on a BTC exchange and why it cannot cause the same effect?

Coolio. I wasn't trying to call you out, just fully understand how futures are connected to the markets. 
From your previous conversation I thought there was possibly some separation of the futures from actual sells so it might not directly impact the markets and therefore the price.
Kind of how I can bet as much on a horse race with my buddy as I want without affecting the odds at the bookie.
Can you explain how the price on the futures market will impact the market? I'd appreciate the explanation.

It depends on the exchange. Every exchange that has leverage has to have some type of lending. I can't speak for them all but from my experience Poloniex, Bitfinex and QuoineX all have user based lending. You lock your Bitcoin up and earn daily interest rates. It's a lowish risk way to make a little extra from your bitcoin if you have it sitting doing nothing in an exchange. [Interest rate history example]( excl. fees). A currently maintained [open source lending bot for Poloniex and Bitfinex]( that can get you near the best rates possible.

Go to the page with your favourite number.

@_date: 2017-12-06 08:13:29
Thanks so if it's disconnected from actual price how can it have any impact on the market.
Is it because people will look to what's happening on the futures and use it as an indicator of future price movement to make real market decisions, kind of a self fulfilling prophesy approach?
So we'll see people build highspeedtrading bots to read the futures market and buy and sell on the real markets in response?
I know so little. It just sounds like betting on horse racing. The money affects the odds I get but not the outcome of the race. ie. if we act like horses, and ignore the odds of the futures market there should be no impact on price. But that's not going to happen because everyone is looking for an edge and some people will use the futures market as a guide which could kind of cause the self fulfilling prophesy if there is enough of them.

The alternative is if the price dropped 99% is he entitled to the full value at the time of the theft or his he only entitled to the 1% of the original value. Can he have it both ways. Some would say if it was a theft he should get it the best of both ways.

I look at it as just being more forward thinking. Most people think Segwit will increase bitcoin utility, and that will most likely be reflected by a higher bitcoin price. The higher Bitcoin price goes the more trading is done, the more trading the more profit per exchange. Not to mention the extra services that an exchange may be able to offer when the utility of Segwit hits the blockchain. 
You don't need to have an immediate use for increased utility to realise that it will likely be a good idea in the short to medium term.
I know people in pretend owners of miners and exchanges are perfect economic actors, but they've proved clearly they're not. Some have vision and some have hidden agendas.

Unfortunately now mining is centralized to 10 or 15 people. If a few of them can only compete if they can access hardware from one vendor then that hardware vendor has all the power over those mining pools. And if those mining pools control more than 5% of the hashing power they can force bitcoin development to stagnate. And this is a race. If a coin won't increase in utility the door is open for an alt-coin to surpass it.

It's not 0% to my understanding because this is the current sign up bonus text for today:


You're eligible for a 22% bonus on the first deposit you make when signing up.  
Example: If you deposit 1BTC, you receive a 0.22BTC bonus.  
The bonus is released gradually based on your trading volume and amounts on average to a cashback on your trades until the full bonus amount is exhausted.  
Since the bonus is released based on your trading volume, there is no maximum limits on the amount you deposit.  
You can withdraw your full deposit and released bonus at any time – there are no holding conditions.

It only needs to be enough for long enough for other scaling solutions to be developed. On chain scaling is finite if we want distributed nodes.

Early this month. Want to buy some of the only competitive miners at the moment S9s. They're finally available after all being reserved for months by a mining pool controlled indirectly by Bitmain. Full of hope I create a Bitmain account and try to place an order to have them shipped to my hosting company. at the end of the process I can choose any country to ship my miners to except the country with cheap electricity that my hosting company resides in. This is the only country where the miner will likely return a good profit and be competitive with the enormous resources of the Bitmain funded pools that get bulk discounts and local shipping costs. I raise a docket about the shipping limitation, I'm informed to order to mainland China you have to order from the Chinese site, so I do, I find a Chinese friend who can walk me through the ordering process on the Chinese site. The S9s are not available for purchase within China. I raise a follow up docket, "There is too much demand in China so you cannot ship to China". I investigate using a Hong Kong forwarding company to bounce the order off but the shipping costs become exorbitant and markedly reduce the expected likely-hood of a decent return.
Blatantly, dangerously anti-competitive.
How about instead of calling names you have a civil discussion.

Find somewhere to host them in China, will run them for me charge affordable rent, but easily still profitable. Decide to give it a go.
English Bitmain site, can buy the miners but cannot send to China. 
Chinese Bitmain site can send to china but will not sell me miners.
Bitmain obviously don't want any independently owned miners with competitive electricity rates because then the miner would be as profitable as their in house mining pools.
I have the money, I have the host, I have the agreement. Bitmain won't sell to me.
They are being outright anti-competitive. 
Bitmain is the biggest threat Bitcoin has ever faced. It's the epitome of anti-competitive centralization. Capitulating to Bitmain's demands is really really really dangerous.

With all due respect, none of them.
* And with all due respect back to you - thanks for engaging in this conversation ...
Bitcoin is a decentralized system, people should stop trying to find a "leader" or "representative".
* All systems have leaders, titled as such or not.
Even if Core developers and BU people agreed on something, they don't have to power to unilaterally implement it.
* There are many sources and forms of power, including the power gained by reputation, knowledge, history, respect, and influence. If 3 developers for whom you have great respect recommend something, you are going to at least consider it.
That power in bitcoin (and all cryptocurrencies) is with the economic majority expressing it's wish through using full nodes as wallets. That's not my opinion, that's how bitcoin works on a technical level.
* Yes, but development also influences the economic majority and what the majority uses.
What's probably going to happen is after the current bip9 period of segwit ends, the bitcoin economy may choose to do a user-activated-soft-fork that activates segwit, which is not subject to a veto by the miners.
* Yes, this may turn out to be a path forward, and right now, I am asking a question about what we might do before next November.

They are rent seeking, tryung to change the rules (software) to consolidate their power and keep out competition. It's completely logical, the upside for them is enormous. And with so few options for buying mining hardware or countries to run them at a profit, everyone's at their mercy to a degree.

Just to expand my understanding, the key is the time that the initial lender gives you to pay it back. You must pay the borrowed amount of coins back before the due date of the loan.
This leads to a question, if it keeps rising and you realize a drop that big is exceedingly unlikely you could buy the coins back early to limit your losses, correct?

Bitcoin is a great hedge against failing economies and corrupt governments. It's often easier to purchase and hide than foreign currency or gold.  Being a store of value gives it value in and of itself without needing lots of transactions. And every year a different country goes hyperinflation, or corrupt, or bans a high denomination note, or cracks down on foreign investment etc etc.

And sellers raise their asking prices to the point buyers are willing to pay. So buyers drive the price up. It's both that's how the market works. But scarcity also drives the market. So if everyone keeps a small% when they  sell it will become more scarce faster. Bitcoin is naturally a shrinking market which should keep the pressure on prices long term as long as people see value in it.

Don't even think of getting your coins off the exchange until you have some way of keeping them safer than an exchange does, you know those exchanges that pay someone to do nothing but keep those coins safe.. 
More people get hacked than exchanges get hacked.
To be as safe on an exchange (as safe as that gets) set up 2FA, use a unique email and long unique password.*edit 
To be "safe" holding your own keys, you need a hardware wallet and a written copy of the seed words stored offsite in a fireproof safe where no one else can access them. 
Or you need to do a lot of work and learn a lot. Mutlisig Wallets, fresh installed - Airgapped PC, checksummed wallet software, paper backup stored off site in a fireproof safe, written instructions for next of kin etc etc.
Don't move your coins until you've learnt a huge amount about all the things that can go wrong.
Telling people to "Get your coins off of the exchange." is not good advice by itself, it's dangerous advice and plays into the hands of hackers that are not good enough to hack exchanges.
*On the exchange, use your real details and get fully verified asap don't wait untill you need to withdraw funds for an emergency.

It depends on the amount you want to sell and the timing, Independent reserve has about the lowest fees for the Australian market but sometimes a greater spread than BTCMarkets, so compare buy offers to see who can buy all your coins for the most after fees.

UPDATE 9-Nov: So today I woke up to the news of the fork being cancelled. BT2 trading at $200 and B2X trading at $320. Obviously not the outcome I was hoping for, but I always knew this was a gamble. I still think it was a good gamble for the odds and that it had positive expected value. I’d do it again.
The moral of the story is, don’t risk what you aren’t happy to lose.

Bitcoin is many things to many people, one of those things was fast cheap (specially international) payments. Libra will have that going for it. I'd never want anyone to use it for the downsides, but you have to admit it's a killer feature.
I wanted to use Bitcoin to cheaply send money to my family in another country. And even though I already own the Bitcoin, the % fees were going to be higher than an international bank transfer. That cost destroys that use of Bitcoin entirely until it's overcome.

High fees caused by a once off event. 2x cancellation, causing 2x supporters jumping to BCash making BCash suddenly more profitable to mine making miners jump ship till the difficulty adjusts, causing Bitcoin mining to slow down substanially, causing the mem pool to fill, causing fee competition to jump.

How can you say that. The price of entry for a mining farm is already high. Once the data requirements are doubled or quadrupled actual competitive mining will be even more difficult and expensive to break into. Bitmain will consolidate it's monopoly on mining hardware. They already act anti-competitively.  On top of that the hardware and data requirements of larger blocks will reduce the number of nodes. Especially nodes not run on cloud.
It's not rocket science it's simple logic.

How do you find the transactions and the order they need to be concatenated in?
80bytes per transaction, that's not much, but then also ignore the first 2bytes or 3bytes as an index?

It sounds like they have a larger spread than you would like (the difference between their buy and sell price) it's common on non market based exchanges to have a large spread but low/no fees.
3% is pretty standard for moving cash internationally. All Australian exchanges tend to have approximately a 2% to 3% premium because of the cost of changing to a currency other than AUD.

A lack of nodes won't hold 2x back, a lack of miners will hold Bitcoin back badly. Bitcoin transactions are expensive enough already without having to compete with six times as many transactions competing for space in each block.

That we are in a bubble I'm assuming.
A bubble as in there will be a dip soon, or a bubble as in it's overpriced and will drop to a much lower stable true value for a long time? Because sure there will be dips, it's naturally volatile, but given demand and how many are in this for the long term, I don't see it as a "Bitcoin is way overpriced" bubble. I don't see it correcting back down to $300 for 3 years or anything.

This is why having miners writing the node software is the antithesis of Bitcoin. Miners decide they want more bitcoin (they get first use so most benefit), make new limit 42mil, slow down reward halving, and invalidate non mining nodes.
We need three parts, developers not linked to miners, users (nodes) not linked to developers or miners, and miners. And they should all be independent. Like the branches of Government. Keep each other honest.
Having a miner writing the node software and saying the only important node is a mining node is a really really terrible idea.

From the article "Truncated graphs are useful in illustrating small differences.[16] Graphs may also be truncated to save space.[16] Commercial software such as MS Excel will tend to truncate graphs by default if the values are all within a narrow range, as in this example." so everyone uses them and they're on by default in the most popular graphing software in the world. It's only "very misleading " as claimed by if you don't often create or read graphs regularly. Every Crypto related website and apps uses them almost to the exclusion of other y axis labelling options.

Node count I don't hold in much esteem as the people behind 2x have always stated that the only nodes that matter are mining nodes which is true if you don't mind running a coin with less trust than we've had before. 
Luke Jr's poll was by Luke Jr and will be skewed by his supporters. 
Dev support is great but exactly what this whole split is about. Big businesses (miners) removing developer support, so it's not really a negative for 2x on a fork level. 
I've been watching Bitfinex futures and the argument against their validity is pretty lame to be honest, this is the best argument here but it's now without controversy.

You've just got to go on recent history, what are the chances of the next dip going far enough below the current price and that you will be smart/lucky enough to time your buy before it gets back up above the current price?
How long have you waited for the dip and how much have you lost by waiting. How much are you willing to lose waiting for a dip that might not drop it to today's price.
FOMO. The only smart move is to buy a bit each day, a bit each pay, dollar cost averaging.

I see two main risks, both would take time, at least a 2-3 of years. Neither would reduce it to $0 but both would destroy a majority of it's value.
Firstly it could be regulated out of existence. If the American, Chinese, Russian and European union all banned companies from converting fiat into btc it would decimate the price and probably all crypto-currencies but I think this is highly unlikely, not many regulators want to be seen as the regulator that banned their country from "internet two" and all the advancement that came with it.
Bitcoin could also stagnate and new coins with better software/usability/functionality could replace bitcoin's dominance. But Bitcoin has the benefit of being the biggest most secure and has the biggest network effect so I see this as unlikely. Sure the young smart coin will come along but there is room for lots of coins for lots of purposes and the money invested in those coins won't come out of the Bitcoin economy.
Not going to happen, not worth worrying about risks:
Long term quantum computing could allow cracking the security. But that's a long long long, probably never way off.
The internet is gone, probably power too. ie. Cataclysm, the Rapture, WW3, Zombie apocalypse. Bitcoin price is least of your worries.

Lawful Neutral, a follower of Helm I assume.
I'm more of the opinion that no one can obey all laws there are too many and they are obtuse and don't always benefit society. They're  to often made by the wealthy and powerful to protect their own interests at the expense of the unfortunate. So obey the laws you must to not get in trouble, break the unjust or morally bad, or trivial laws you can get away with. But most importantly do not harm or hinder others.
To many laws are used as a stick, the carrot approach to society is better.
I'm more of a Neutral Good personality, a Chauntea follower I guess.

If you're in IT or consider yourself IT literate you've got no excuse for not backing yourself on Crypto.
There was an article about it on reddit back in the day talking about the white paper. I thought it was really interesting but my pc was always overheating so never started mining. I forgot about it till 2013 and bought in during the great Gox spike. Then the crash hurt. I didn't panic. Hodled and I'm way way back on top.

I'm not going to talk about the technical transaction limits of the bitcoin network, they're spelt out by others below.  Instead I'm going to touch on the difficulty of competing in the mining space.
To be a miner you need access to mining hardware. You can either buy or lease from a company that is also mining, or you can build your own hardware.
Designing and building your own mining hardware that is competitive requires access to a 16nm prefab facility and many millions of dollars. Both are hard to come by.
Buying a miner from a mining hardware maker is ok and returns a profit, but the problem is you're competing with the people that make the hardware, what they can produce for &lt;$300 they charge you $1100 for. They will also only sell you a miner if you are in a country with uncompetitive electricity prices. The Antminer 9S models (only competitive model on the market) cannot be shipped to China where the worlds cheapest electricity is available in data centres. Bitmain the mining company that manufactures the hardware have created many mining pools running in Chinese data centres. They don't want to compete on a level playing field (cost of hardware or cost of electricity) because, well, why the hell would they. They sell a small portion of their miners to individuals to keep up an illusion of competition while pouring enormous profits back into making more hardware and consolidating their position. They then use this monopoly of the hash power to push their own (one person's) agenda on the whole bitcoin ecosystem. This is because to make a change to the bitcoin network you need the mining pools to mine using the upgraded software, and to make sure it goes smoothly a vast majority of miners must use the new software or there will be a bitcoin blockchain split.
Bitmain's mining pool also most likely run Covert ASIC boost on their miners which reduces their electricity cost by approximately %30 this increases the ROI for them by a huge amount as most of the cost of running a Bitcoin miner is electricity. The problem with Covert ASIC boost is that a lot of the advances and improvements to the Bitcoin network will stop it working. This puts the miners profits directly at odds with the improvement of the bitcoin network. A vast majority of people believe that this is why the big mining pools run by Bitmain are blocking SegWit and why they are spending so much on FUD about Bitcoin Core developers. 
They are making 10x the profit they would if bitcoin doubled in price, but they lost their monopoly.
Add to this that the miners are scared that if side chain payment channels such as Lighning Network are enabled (easy with SegWit) that the number of transactions will go down cutting into mining profits in the future. Another incentive to stand in the way of Bitcoin's users interests.

I don't have a solution, but I know the solution isn't greater consolidation of mining.
ASICs don't necessarily need to be cheaper, but at the moment Bitmain will not even sell you an expensive one (or 20) if you're having it sent where electricity is cheap enough to compete with their mining pools. I was personally denied.
Ideally mining manufacturers would have to choose whether to mine, or sell miners, not both, serious conflict of interest happening here. 
Jihan already has a monopoly on mining hardware that is rapidly cementing an unassailible monopoly on mining and therefore "concensus" it's a very difficult problem. 
One that Satoshi didn't leave us a solution for.

No, instead I trust the hundreds of people contributing to the ideas, reviewing and testing Core's code in a public forum. Including the contributions by the members employed by Bitstream and other companies. The same people that have bought Bitcoin to the amazing position it is now without one contentious hard fork to be a major disruptive force in tech and finance.
Definitely trust them more than someone who "forgets" a remote kill switch in his hardware, invests money putting covert ASIC boost on his chips and sponsors a bunch of programmers to build competing node software that has "a simple increase to one variable" but manages to implement critical bugs that don't get found until it's running live because of the complete incompetence of the coders and testers.
Core is accountable. Code doesn't get run unless it's accepted by the miners. If miners control the code, there is literally nothing stopping them doing anything they want. They could remove the 21m cap or do anything else they want. It'd be in their interests as they get first use of the new coins, the same as the Fed in the US. If miners control the code there is no checks and balances.

No, but he's lying about competition in mining. There's a weakness in Bitcoin and Jihan has found it and is doing his damnedest to exploit it.


He's trying, and Bitcoin is trying to defend itself against a monopolistic powerplay. But like government regulation it's a risk that must be faced. Hopefully his efforts will get shut down, a new mining manufacturer will prove an actual competitor so miners can make a choice, and we'll have learned from this attack.

And we're rapidly learning the hard lesson over again. A true free market is not sustainable in this day and age without regulation. A monopoly forms and once it dominates the market they rent seek, which is exactly what Jihan is doing by trying to take over the governance of Bitcoin.
I'd love to contribute to a crowd funded opensource hardware ASIC design, or something, but without access to a 10nm chip fab, friends at Intel or Samsung, or half a billion dollars I'm pretty much out of luck.

BU wanted to make it so miner consensus overruled nodes settings after 3 blocks.  
are always saying non mining nodes mean nothing.  
are always saying reducing the non economic nodes doesn't matter.   
His hero Craig Wright thinks nodes should be 20k and only run by miners.  
He definitely wants to control the code, he's openly or covertly funded 5 alternate clients.  
He already has a monopoly on mining hardware.  
Via his control of the hardware he can control a lot of the hashpower which means miner voting.
Even if his plan isn't complete control of Bitcoin, It's still not something we should hand to one person. Bitcoin works because the coders have to get consensus from miners and node operators. It's like The three arms of government. And Jihan is Trump trying to sack the Judiciary and replace it with cronies. Maybe the sky won't fall in but who wants to find out?
And you're right, that's why the forks are coming, we've got a possible 3 versions of Bitcoin on the Radar, some users and some miners are forking off. We'll have our segwit coin and our cash.

No hundreds of people contributing ideas.


That's not true, if Core put out a client with a 210m cap the miners wouldn't upgrade their nodes and it'd be back to the drawing board.
But if the miners (who have the incentive to increase the cap) control the mining and the node software they can with impunity. You seem to be missing the point, you need both, miners and developers, and you need them separate, like the Judiciary and Executive powers to keep each other in check. Jihan is trying to be a Dictator that shuts down the Judiciary branch or stacks it with cronies.

The fact he built ASICBOOST into his chips it is evidence. The fact that he didn't document it is evidence. The fact he will to anything for profit is evidence. The fact he mines empty blocks is evidence. All of it circumstantial but it's evidence.
@_date: 2019-05-28 20:03:34
It takes time for the empty block to propagate to the other miners and then they have to include the new block in their next block so have to construct a new block and start searching again. It does delay the transactions. It also gives the empty block miner a head start on the next block.
It is selfish miner behaviour at the expense of the network and does delay transactions. That said I don't think any action should be taken.

See, calling something stupid or toxic or ridiculous or that something is just obvious are all appeals to emotion. You're so deeply invested in being right you're not making real arguments.
The miners maybe using all core's code with some minor changes to fork away from the reference client because they were forced to compromise by BIP418 but that won't change much. They'll still have to get the hard fork through three months later and they don't have the developers or testers to do it safely.
Bitmain quite possibly control over 50% of the hashrate themselves. Their break even Bitcoin price is rumored to be $413. They're enormously profitable compared to the rest of the miners. They're not saying you don't have to trust us, they're saying we cannot be trusted (as evidenced by poor code, poor choices, anti-competitive behaviour, paid tweeting etc.), but let us write the client all the miners will run. It'll be in everyone's interests not just ours.
Block size increase is a linear solution to an exponential scaling problem. It's short sighted by design. SegWit is a tried and tested temporary fix that opens the door to powerful scaling solutions.


Like every dictator around the world, theoretically great but their interests are short term profit and rent seeking. Just like every other big business. It's more profitable to control the market than to compete in it especially as you gain more than 50% of the market and Bitmain machines run an estimated 80% of the hashpower.

This makes the very unlikely assumption that Bitmain/Jihan/et al. only control 7.9% of the hash power and that their overheads are large (in china) and that there equipment only has %100 markup.
Lets assume to not cause 51% attack worries they've been reinvesting their profits in $300 hardware continuously for 2 years and mining on a variety of other pools. By now they'd control much closer to 40% of the total hashpower, and the amount saved in electricity is much higher. It also has the much greater impact on other miners that are not running ASIC boost and are not able to reinvest any where near as much back into their operations even if they are manufacturing their own miners.
I call nonsense on that piece of guesswork.

They don't have to reinvest %100 of their profits, just 3% more than the other miners. And they are so capable of this with their advantage in hardware cost, and of course covert ASIC boost.

It comes down to who do you trust.
A distributed group of developers with a long history of excellent work and open ideas who believe in getting the most utility out of Bitcoin. 
Or do you believe a mining company that quietly slipped covert ASIC boost on to a chip, quietly slipped a back door into their firmware with a kill switch, quietly pay twitter users to retweet their opinions, quietly don't sell competitive miners if you can [actually compete]( with their mining pool to maintain an illusion of competition.
If you believe the miners over the developers have the best intentions and outcomes of Bitcoin at heart, I question your motives. What have you to gain by Bitmain becoming the dominant force in the Bitcoin ecosystem. They're the only reason we don't have a 70% increase in capacity right now and powerful layer two settlement solutions on the horizon.

Bitcoin is slow and difficult to safely change by design. Changing the POW would be the biggest single change to Bitcoin ever and would ruin a lot of people not just inconvenience the mining company messing with the network so would be a decision not to be taken lightly in fact to be avoided at almost any cost. All this 'Just fork off' crap is not helpful, the grown-ups want to work shit out.

When the restaurant got popular the greedy suppliers would not allow the chef to expand the menu because they were making so much money from the ingredients he was buying off them they denied him the ability to buy different and improved produce.
We can make stupid analogies all day. The most broken thing in Bitcoin is mining. It's opaque, dominated by one Chinese company with very questionable business practices that writes shitty code.

Firstly dont buy ripple. Secondly a bitcoin site should not ask for your bank password, but if they use a payment facilitator such as poli, the intemediary site (poli for example) may request it. They don't store it they just act as a guarentor to the bitcoin site that the money has been sent. This is because banks take ages to actually confirm, and you couldn't immediately buy otherwise.
You could use a different funding option but you'd have to wait longer.
If it is poli you're refferencing, I've been using them to secure plane flights for 10 years to save paying credit card fees without issue.

Why would you assume they've only reinvested so little in building mining hardware for themselves? It makes no sense to sell most of the hardware, The mining hardware pays itself off in 4 months, why sell it, when it pays itself off in 2 months if they keep it.


I was talking non electricity overheads, why would their non electricity overheads be 2x what I get charged for a managed data centre in china?


At the end of the day, each month they can hang on to a advantage over the other miners they're reinvesting their larger profits into their mining operations cementing their position.
Say they're only getting a 3% per month advantage over other miners and the rest of the miners had a similar other costs (they don't), compounded over 2 years their 7.9% would now be 15% of the network. I assumed they started with closer to 20%.

Just the covert version. The only version they run. The version cementing their patent protected monopoly on mining.

One reason is lending. Returns on lending are a bit like mining low risk but increase your holdings. And Bitcoin lending has the best returns. I'm always torn. Prices go up and down, but my Bitcoin holdings accrue interest every day.
I was %75/%25 BTC/ETH but due to ETHs recent craziness I'm %25/%75 now. Obviously diversifing worked this year, but that's no guarantee.

See now you're talking. Nvidia ASICs.
Though with their long history of anti-competitive and underhanded tactics they could be worse than Wu &amp; Co.
That said not many places in the world can compete with China's electricity prices. So Bitmain and their 5 pools will still have a massive advantage.

Most people I know associate milli with small and micro with tiny m's not withstanding. 
It's like I said though. You will only get it wrong once. Overpaying by 1000 is a pretty enormous mistake. Sorry you just spent $4000 on that $4 burger.
As soon as you look at it as real currency you don't get it wrong.
People don't get thousand dollars and million dollars mixed up. And look at a game like PoE it has something like 20 different currency items with different values. But because they are currency people learn them.

Exactly it's part of how miners get paid. And once the last bitcoin is mined it will be the only way miners get paid.
Fees are used to prioritise your transaction in the memory pool of all unconfirmed transactions. A miner pulls the transactions they want from the memory pool to include in a block that they will add to the blockchain. They select the transactions with the highest fees as they get to keep the fee along with the 12.5BTC block reward for adding the block before any other miners.
If there was no fee, any asshat could generate millions of worthless transactions and block out a majority of actual transactions. This still happens a lot, but at least the spam costs the spammers a lot to keep the blocks full because they've got to compete with the other paid transactions.

It becomes interesting if you you're a trader with lots of accounts, lending, and you use it for buying things on line that don't necessarily have receipts.

You did have easy problems, but that's a good sign, they're triaging tickets, form letter responses are going out as a priority allowing them to deal with lots of easy tickets, the harder ones that require investigation are delayed obviously. It's the smart way to run a support center when you're way under capacity trying to catch up and train new people.

Bitcoin is a trustless payment platform, not a trustless development platform. ie. You don't have to trust anyone if you don't change the system. 
If you want to improve the system you need to trust the people making the changes. The developers are not saying trust me they're saying read our code, and make up your own mind. And we'll explain our reasoning, our reasoning is based on the discussions on an open forum, you can read it. But decisions were made you have to trust we implemented these changes with the safety security and capability of the system in mind.
The miners are saying trust us we don't control 50% of the hashrate. We won't backdoor our hardware, we won't install or run buggy half arsed poorly tested code.
I don't trust Bitmain as far as I can throw them. They've proved over and over and over they will cheat and lie and hide their actions and intentions to increase their short term profits.
