Privatize profits and socialize losses, it's the only way to go. And don't be peddling fiction now that the economy isn't doing amazing.

I assume that you mean the quickBT issue with not accepting the 16 digit visa hybrid cards, i ran into this problem myself as well.
If you're in the GTA (longshot), Bitsent just launched an ATM in downtown Mississauga inside a small cell phone accessory store. I used this atm early last week. The fees are also quite high but it was handy (15% for now, I believe they are lowering it to 7%). I was told the 15% fee at launch is to cover their insurance costs for launching the ATM. I would still rather pay the 15% to a local trustworthy company than to an offshore website. Bitsent is in the process of launching 200 bitcoin atms. I'm not sure if that's just in Ontario or for all of Canada. Good luck !

the whole point of bitcoin is to eliminate loans. Peter prefers fiat because he can take a loan for a million dollars and only pay 2 thousand in interest. Meanwhile, the average joe also pays 2 thousdand in interest for his 20 thousand dollar loan. This is why he's so anti bitcoin.

If this doesn't prove that bitcoin is going mainstream, I'm not sure what will. 
It tells you alot when one the world's largest banks is abandoning the very fiat currency that it represents !!

please make another one with some more bitcoin characters, like the clueless non techy guy who just buys bitcoin because his brother talks to him about it non-stop!!

just wait until this happens to 95% of the ATMs in the USA that run off of Windows XP...I'm convinced it will happen very soon except the hackers will be doing it to take all of the money that they can.
What I find hilarious is that the older generations don't give young kids enough credit as to how smart they are especially with computer programming skills. A lot of young kids today are lazier than ever but a lot are smarter than ever as well.

I recently got this card and I live in Canada....Works decent....Fees are quite high when loading bitcoin and spending usd in Canada but I don't mind paying because I support the bitcoin community 100%. I would rather give 
e-coin my business than a local bank.

No bailouts either for RBC customers in Canada when somebody hacks your bank account !!! Time for Canadians to drain their accounts since they are no longer safe.

Yet I can't withdrawl my 0.3 litecoin from Cryptsy because the USA Government needs my personal information (need to uprade to Tier 1). I don't live in USA so why do they need to spy on me if crypto is tax free?

What a fuckin joke of an article. Reminds me of a Federal Reserve employee on a recent netflix documentary in which the guy said that the Fed is decentralized because it diversifies it's risk across many major banks.
