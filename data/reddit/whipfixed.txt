I believe the reason "most people would get their coins stolen" is the QT client uses wallet.dat. This is a file which contains your private key and addresses/public keys. If someone were to obtain this file, they can spend all of your btc. 
Nowadays, it is pretty common for malware to check for the existence of wallet.dat and upload to somewhere the attacker can get it. Next thing you know, wallet empty. Coins gone.

Not looking for the dollar, just wanted to say sorry for your misfortune. Medical debt is a bitch. Hope things turn around for you. You'll be happy you're over invested when it hits 2k.

Absolutely not. It is much safer when comparing apples to apples. Example, I sell you something online. Now send me some cash. It is either extremely unsafe or extremely expensive to do it. With Bitcoin, both of those issues are alleviated. How about cash in person? Is it counterfeit? Not an issue anymore. 
Bitcoin is a replacement for currency. It is the most low level base of this new economy. We do not yet have "banks" to hold our Bitcoin in an insured location. These will come in the future. But Coinbase or Gox or Blockchain.info is not it. They are akin to leaving your money at a friends house. You can trust *them* (for the most part) but you can't count on them to keep your money safe.

Oh is it that fast now? I started with them a while ago and I had to wait months for my invite.

Sounds a lot like [my comment]( yesterday that got all kinds of hate.

Great bank/service. Unless you need to immediately withdrawal large sums of cash, it can't be beat. You're gonna need an invite if you decide to signup though. Let me know if you want one.

To be honest, I look at this as a positive thing. It has brought this issue to light. I know we have heard over and over again how this has been known for quite some time, but  seeing it in the wild is different than on paper. Now that this has been/will be addressed by all the major exchanges and online wallets, it will only serve to harden Bitcoin. 
Edit: The *issue* is obviously not positive and it's clearly going to affect the price temporarily, but the fact that this will no longer be a problem anymore, thats a positive thing.

People need to stop looking at this as *funds in an account* and more as *digital cash*. You can't leave cash lying around. If you leave cash at your friends house, it might be safe, or they might get drunk and forget to lock their door on the way out. Then when someone comes in and takes it off the counter, is it their fault for leaving the door open or your fault for thinking your cash will be safe indefinitely at your friends house?
I want to be in control of my cash. If my money gets stolen, I want to know its because I messed up and got robbed. Not because my friend forget to lock the door. 
While a lot of these sites and exchanges definitely need a good security audit, this isn't going to stop until there's a paradigm shift regarding digital currency.

They're actually struggling pretty badly. People use it as an Amazon showroom rather than a place to buy electronics. Their prices are high, long lines, sales people who don't know or don't care, and you can't read reviews about what you're buying (without going to Amazon). 
The only reason I'll buy something there is if I need it *now* for some reason.

How would you go about wiring on Saturday night? How about wiring money internationally? What kind of fees are you looking at? Perhaps for 500k they would waive the fees but most people aren't wiring half a million dollars. 
As for the "proof of purchase" issue. This is easily resolved with an escrow. Also, from my very basic understanding, Bitcoin has/will have the ability to embed an escrow model into a transaction wherein 2 of the 3 people/parties must confirm before it the payment can be verified. I could be way off on this but I remember Antonopolous speaking about it when he was on Rogan. 
I'm not saying sending cash now is impossible. I'm saying its impractical and expensive.

Storing your wallet with 950 BTC on a striped array? Bold move.

Hang out on /biz/ and lurk in the discord. You'll see several posts a day of someone claiming to know about an upcoming PnD. Pick one that looks promising, invest heavy, spend the next couple days watching Poloniex non-stop, drink heavily, hope for the best. Maybe you get in early on PotCoin and your investment goes up %10,000, maybe you get trolled and become a pawn of the pump and completely miss the dump. Good luck!

RAID 0 is what's called a striped array. You can have 2 or more disks in RAID 0. It's used for performance since the disks are accessed in parallel. However, if one of the disks fails, the whole array is dead and the data is irrecoverable (without a backup). 
RAID 1 on the other hand is a mirrored array. You add disks of equal size in pairs. There are no performance gains, however if one of the disks fails, you don't lose any data. The RAID is degraded but you can simply replace that bad disk with a new one, it resilvers, and all is well again. 
The rule is, you *never* save anything that is not easily recoverable on RAID 0. Six million in Bitcoin would probably be on the top of the list of things I wouldn't save on a striped array.

It was on every mainstream news channel for over a month. Every normie on social media was posting screenshots of the price and their coinbase. It mooned. Not saying it's dead but that was the moon everyone dreamt of.

She might be mining other crypto that is profitable to mine with a GPU, converting to Bitcoin, and simplifying it to "I mine Bitcoin" to avoid long explanation.

You're going to lose a good chunk of money no matter how you try to liquidate that. 
Your best bet is to go to the post office and buy a money order with the gift card (select debit and pin is any 4 numbers). Deposit money order into your bank account. Buy BTC.
