Some of us like to keep their wealth.  If my wealth goes up, I am content with that.  If my wealth goes down, then not so much.

Except: 


I would argue that suspended animation is not death.  And as long as an individual is in "suspended animation" and has a trust fund able to pay off the operating costs to maintain their body in this state, they are not legally dead.  And every twenty years or so, as long as the body remains in suspended animation, the trust rolls over into a new duplicate version of itself if necessary.

I would rather see posts like "Why bitcoin price could hit all time lows in 2016".  I can't stand this hype bullshit.  I'd rather be more informed about how I could lose.

I don't have to worry if it goes up.  If it goes up, my biggest worry is how to spend it without declaring capital gains.
If do have to worry about it going down though.

Unlikely, not impossible.   And I'm not worried about it reaching $0.  I am more worried about the possibility that it reaches $100, or $10, or $1.  For all intents and purposes, a 99.75% loss is just as bad as 100%.
