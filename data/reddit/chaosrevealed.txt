Nah. Since all the nutcases here clearly believe in the long term value of Bitcoin,
RemindMe! 10 years
3 months is nothing to r/bitcoin after all, right? HODL till you die

I don't understand nearly enough to be investing any substantial sum into cryptocurrencies. But it seems like the vast majority of people here know even less than I do but are all too willing to throw money at something just because they see dollar signs, instead of actually understanding how anything about the tech or about currencies or about how basic economics or finance works. That these people are willing to risk significant sums of money on something they don't fundamentally understand is insanity.
I sincerely hope these people haven't poured their life savings into bitcoin. Wall Street is now involved and their capital will vastly dwarf whatever these HODLers have on hand. They can easily manipulate the market and will reap all the benefits, fucking it up for those that have their life savings invested in the process.

Basic macroeconomics is more legit than the shit 500,000 users here are spouting off as the word of god, or from some bitcoin bible, especially when you have users in this very thread tree that don't even know how deflation interacts with the market and with interest rates.


You want this again, do you? Try moving to sub-saharan Africa, or finding a time machine to the dark ages. See how much you like it there.
Barter system is garbage for a reason. If you actually want to return to a more primitive form of society, go right ahead. But don't argue that your deluded ideals for society is the right choice for everyone else.

And what happens when the US and EU government sees all cryptos as a threat and outlaws it, crashing the entire market in the process? 
Will you move to Russia? Will you declare bankruptcy? Or did you intelligently **not** put your entire life savings into this hypecoin so your economic freedom isn't impacted by your government?

Let's see how you get out of the Great Depression without economic levers.

Losing 20% of the entire supply wouldn't matter? Delusional.

US government is successfully repealing Net Neutrality laws, only 2 years after they were made. What makes you so confident that they won't heavily regulate or outlaw cryptocurrencies, especially since some of you insist that bitcoin is some revolutionary way to get rid of the dominance of USD? 
@_date: 2017-12-11 12:00:27
You're kidding. Rich people love inflation. They're the ones that created this system to systematically transfer money from the poor to the rich through inflation. They're the ones that can actually get approved to borrow big sums of money from banks to invest with. They're the ones with the insight to put capital into winning investments.
Poor people can't do this shit. They can barely get their down payments. Meanwhile wages stay the same and inflation keeps going. They make less and less every year, and more and more of that money is saved by the rich. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:06:48
Oh, you sure about that? You sure that the moment cryptocurrencies pose a risk to USD hegemony, they wouldn't outlaw it?
RemindMe! 10 years 
If the government doesn't ever regulate cryptocurrencies, I'll eat my dick.
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:34:02
So you'd rather have Wall Street and massively consolidated Chinese mining networks dictating how your assets are valued. Okay. 
Good luck, and I hope you haven't put your life savings into cryptos, because you're in for a hell of a ride and then bankruptcy.
@_date: 2017-12-11 10:40:10
Holy fuck. It's exactly the people like you that need to watch the fuck out when you put money into something you don't fundamentally understand. I say this with complete sincerity. Learn a thing about economics before you dump your life savings into bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 11:51:31
Shouldn't say anything if you don't understand anything.
@_date: 2017-12-11 09:10:38
Lol. If you think the US government will give up that easily or lose an economic war to a decentralized market with a 400billion market cap, you need to get your brain checked. If you think the current western economy is in a bigger bubble than this overly engorged bitcoin experiment, you need to get your brain checked once more. 
You're not voting for anything by hodoring. Holders of bitcoin have no say in how the system governs itself. All that power rests in the hands of massively consolidated miner networks. And guess what you can do to be a bigger miner? Buy mining rigs with money. Governments and big corporations can easily pour money into controlling the market. This decentralization is a joke when it can be so easily manipulated.
If you want to make a quick buck, launder money or trade on the black market with bitcoin, feel free. But this isn't the start of some anarchic rebellion against the corrupt government and their financial schemes. Open your eyes and stop being delusional. Bitcoin is too flawed and too easily manipulated for it to kill currency. If this is an ideological war you're looking to support, there's so many more technically and ideologically advanced cryptos to support. Bitcoin is only popular because of its name and nothing else. The simple fact that it's deflationary means it's useless as a replacement for currency. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 09:47:00


That's literally the point of investment. That's how the entire economy system works. That's how the government dictates how interest rates fluctuate. Lower interest rates to raise inflation. Interest rates are low? Corporations and individuals borrow money to invest. Interest rates are high? ROI in investments are low because costs are high, so people put their money in banks and the economy stagnates. Some of you people don't understand basic economics but are still pouring thousands of dollars into this hypecoin. Insane.

As sure as I am about the cause of the Great Depression and about why Japan has been stuck in a depression for 25+ years with no end in sight.
How the fuck is a decentralized currency going to control it's rate of deflation without any economic levers? The moment it drops below a certain threshold, the entire market is dead because of the looming deflationary spiral.
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:10:00
Yall need some fucking history lessons.
Go look at the cause of the Great Depression. Look at the 25+ year long Japanese depression with no end in sight. Cause? Deflation.
@_date: 2017-12-11 11:19:39
So you want the world economy to look like that of Japan? Economic recession and deflation for 25+ years with no end in sight? How about the Great Depression? Heard that was a good time for everybody. 
That's if you even get there. If bitcoin deflation isn't controlled properly, which it cannot be since its a decentralized market, it will just end up in deflationary spiral and render bitcoins useless, since not a single person in their right minds would ever sell a single satoshi because it will always be worth more tomorrow. 
Bitcoin's deflation is clearly defined in the limits satoshi set. Deflation is literally built into bitcoin itself, slowing by a massive 50% every set time period. Even gold didn't experience permenant production dips to this degree. There is no happy ending for this prototype-cryptocurrency, only a sad death by infinite deflation. 
Good news is, many alternative cryptos don't have this fundamental flaw built in. They also have better anonymity and actual industrial usage out of mining. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 09:34:20
Some of you people don't understand basic fucking econ101.
If you have no one willing to spend their bitcoins because it's endlessly deflationary, then the economy dies because less and less purchases are made. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 12:17:03
My advice is this: since you clearly do not understand basic macroeconomics, stop meming and  HODLoring with the rest of this sub and don't put your life savings into bitcoin. Wall Street is here and it's capital will fuck you and the rest of the market. Don't be surprised to see your bitcoin become worthless again. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 07:53:24
USD will be as stable as long as the US and the world uses USD. It's infinitely more stable than any crypotocurrency at this moment, and will be for the foreseeable future. Cryptos aren't replacing shit as long as the US government gives a damn about protecting US hegemony. Even if the stability is artificial, it's still fucking stable, unlike the ridiculous 40% changes every other day for bitcoin.
Bitcoin isn't the savior of economics. It's a very rudimentary proof-of-concept that shows blockchain technology works, which somehow devolved into people pouring money into something they barely understand in the hopes than they can herp derp HODL for stupid profits before the bubble collapses.
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:57:31
What economic freedom do you want? Use and save USD. As long as the US continues to protect it's hegemony, USD is alive and well and will be infinitely more stable than any of these hypecoins. Alternatively, put your savings into Chinese Yuan, since they're going to be the rival superpower in the coming decades and as such will guarantee the value of the Yuan.
If you think by fooling around with bitcoin and HODLering until the end of your days will cause the US to give up it's biggest financial advantage, the fact that nearly every financial transaction in the world deals with USD, you need to get your brain checked. Cryptocurrency will be quite literally executed by US Congress before it ever hopes to topple US Hegemony.

The tech is great and all, but when you let wall street mess with your market, all bets are off. Wall Street is going to take over and fuck it up for everyone but themselves. I just hope these "bitcoin investors" are ready for it.
I barely understand bitcoin so I'm not fucking with it until I do. But it seems like the vast majority of people here know even less than I do, but are willing to or have already dumped $$$ into it and hoping they don't go broke. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 09:51:24
Let's say in 5 years the US, EU governments pass laws outlawing the trading of all cryptocurrencies. The entire market collapses in the west because no one is willing to buy a single satoshi.
What do you do now? Move to Russia? Declare your home to be an independent state? Apply for amnesty? Bitcoin lives because governments allow it to live. The moment it threatens the status quo, it will be dealt with whether anyone likes it or not.
Stop deluding yourself. The banks aren't hurting from you putting your liquid savings into hypecoin instead of in your savings account. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 10:10:52
Jesus Christ.
I hope you don't ACTUALLY have your all your liquid savings in bitcoin right now. If you don't, maybe you won't go broke in a year.
Best of luck to you. You're going to need a heck of a lot of it. And some basic fucking economics knowledge too. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 10:29:32


You're actually delusional if you think this.
