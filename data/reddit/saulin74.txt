Do you get to choose how much to pay in fees, if you are trading in an exchange, they take whatever fees they think you need to pay. I have paid up to $30 in bitcoin fees to move BTC from one exchange to another and not, not everyone can trade on GDAX.

Sounds like what bitcoin needs to be saved. When can we expect it?
@_date: 2018-01-20 05:20:44
From an exchange, last time I transferred some bitcoin it was about $30 USD
@_date: 2018-01-19 22:42:59
Ok but can exchanges use this to do all there BTC transactions and if so when will this happen? BTC transactions fees are insane and they need to come down for BTC to succeed

Look at the 1 month chart. Looks like it's still dropping to me, it still has to see 8K low so I would say it's a good idea
@_date: 2017-12-13 20:25:28
Which dip, did I miss something?
There seems to be a -5.8% drop in the last 24 hrs doesn't seem like dip
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:46:29
What are you talking about?
In other news coinbase has given free BCH to those that had BTC on their account on Aug 1st I believe and they are matching the amount you had at that time?
That could make some people BCH rich
@_date: 2017-12-25 17:16:34
Only on GDAX could this happen since the fees are so damn high that would be something very stupid to do
The same is happening with ETH trades, my god whoever does this crap should be banned
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:54:48
My thought as well, at this point it seems much useful than BTC. BTC transaction fees make BTC worthless
@_date: 2017-12-21 04:49:39
I hope the letter was real, because this bank sure is getting it on these reviews
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:31:16
Holy crap what a dump. So far the crypto market cap dropped like 125 billion I think.
I take it bitcoin drives the price of most alt coins since everything is in the shit hole.
@_date: 2017-12-25 15:51:22
What are the transfer times to send bitcoin from Coinbase to another wallet? And Holy shit the fee is like $30
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:18:35
There is no way for exchanges to control this market manipulation?
It seems like is 2 guys that hold all the coins and they can make it drop to nothing or make it go to the moon. How can this currency ever work when this shit is allowed.
So these people have no way of cashing out with their millions/billions so they just screw with everyone else?
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:44:46
I think I may have 200 transactions to go through at the end of the year. I think I will stick with what my original investment was and what it's when I cash out to find out what my taxes will be
I can actually see people having 500+ transactions. I don't know that they will go to the trouble of trying to figure out what the profit or loss was on each transaction.
I also wonder how the hell do you figure out profit or loss on each transaction when the price changes every 10 seconds and within 30 mins it can be 2000 more or 2000 less.
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:56:36
Did anyone get a huge amount of free BCH from Coinbase?
How the hell does Coinbase give free BCH just because you had BTC at some earlier date
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:04:59
What the hell did really happened?
How the hell do we lose over 100 billion overnight? Did the big holders finally find out how to cash out with millions and billions of dollars at once or simply all that money is now sitting in exchanges?
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:31:10
My bro is willing to lent me $3000 to invest if I repay it in a year. How do capital gains work since I'm borrowing this money and taking a big risk?
I'm gonna probably leave it there for a year. Does my investment count as $3000 since the beginning or say if it goes to $3500, then do I have $500 actually invested since the other $3000 are not mine?
The bottom line, at the end I do need to pay $3000 back, I'm just trying to figure out how I would calculate capital gain or loss here
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:17:24
Yes we need a dip to 14k or so. I hate how the BTC dip brings down all other coins though. Is it because people have the sale orders in BTC and are not at their computer to update the sale order price of their other coins?
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:09:31
I doubt it. I think there is huge market manipulation going on. Specially with these bitcoin bets going on. I bet one of these days it will go like 7k up in one day. This is what happens when a very low percentage of all holders control most of the market.
@_date: 2017-12-18 22:24:43
Thanks for the info. I need to get verified there and start buying my BTC there. Can Canadians fund at GDAX or buy with a Credit Card like they can on Coinbase, or you need to have the coins on another wallet first and then transfer them to GDAX to start trading there?
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:58:28
Haha I received $8.50 worth of Bcash
@_date: 2017-12-11 00:04:16
Same thought here. I don't get any of this bitcoin futures crap but I don't see how it would impact the price of bitcoin anyways since they are not buying or selling bitcoin.
However I thought this is something that you see results in days or weeks not in minutes. If the bets are for minutes that would be insane.
To me this bitcoin futures crap was just introduced to confuse people more and to stop them from trying to buy bitcoin which is what drives the price up

Are there walls on GDAX, what are they at?
Man I hate how Bittrex gets lower price
@_date: 2017-12-25 16:02:00
GDAX has never been able to verify me. Always tells me to try again later after trying to submit my ID lol.
I'm more concern about the transfer time. I already sent it but after 25 mins still shows pending on coinbase and no pending transaction showing on the other wallet when I check it. For the amount being charged I would hope it gets there within 30 mins.
@_date: 2017-12-18 22:12:00
What's up with the fees? Will they just keep going up?
About $17 USD to send $200 to another wallet on coinbase
Bitcoin will be useless for anyone dealing with small transfers unless these fees come down by 90% or so
@_date: 2017-12-19 01:03:56
lol every time I log on to GDAX it wants to verify me, waits 5 mins and tells me to try later.
Can I transfer BTC from Coinbase to GDAX and I won't pay network fees?
Like if I fund my GDAX BTC Wallet from the Coinbase BTC , can I start trading without verification?
@_date: 2017-12-24 01:35:46
Hey guys is the backlog of transactions what causes this huge drops?
I'm assuming a lot of people sold when BTC hit ATH but a lot of transactions are still going through since yesterday?
Also ALTS go down as they are linked to BTC price in exchanges and also people panic selling.
If this is the case, I wonder how far back are these transactions going through from?
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:48:02
So what is driving the price down?
Sell walls at 15k or what?
Or people just not wanting to buy because of the big fees?
