I guess it only displays the 0 derivation path address? Although that is probably enough.
@_date: 2018-05-22 08:43:50
Thank you, your comment made me want to look it up and learn more about it. [From the wiki](


I didn't know about the term "master extended key" and that it was 512 bits, a 256\-bit private key and a 256\-bit something called chain code. Very interesting, I learn something new every day, especially now because of this puzzle. :\)
@_date: 2018-05-24 10:21:04
We all know about derivation path, but you said "a lot more" so I wondered what are all those ways to hide it further.
@_date: 2018-05-19 17:06:22
So we should probably look just at the address for the first derivation path, i.e.  m/44'/0'/0'/0/0 ?
But how to list the addresses starting with 3 on that website? I see them when I switch to BIP49, but I don't think that's the BIP for P2SH?
@_date: 2018-05-24 07:42:41


For example what?
@_date: 2018-05-21 06:46:42
The notdef glyph appears in multiple places when you copy the whitepaper text here.
@_date: 2018-05-24 07:35:56
When you say that you are sure about the order with no doubt, do you mean that the words form a sensible sentence \(with phrases like "online cash" for example\), or the sentence does not make any sense, but the clues which pointed you to put certain words in a certain order are unambiguous, meaning that you found that, for example, the word "online" goes to the 3rd spot, the word "cash" goes to the 8th spot, etc? Or maybe both the sentence makes sense and the clues point to the word positions undoubtedly?
@_date: 2018-05-20 12:36:58
Interesting, looks like you're right! Someone said that the words have exactly 5 angles which may mean something, but now I see that's the simply the default in this generator.
I'm wondering if we can generate the exact same image as the puzzle, so we can compare what has been added manually etc. But I can't seem to create it to have words in the same places. I used 500 as the number of words and the rest I left at default.
And the whole rectangle would be filled, while here we have an empty space in the top right, as if one big word was deleted.
Also, I see that in the generator I get not one, but a few of those notdef symbols (X in a rectangle), so maybe the one in the puzzle is not intentional. On the other hand, in the generator nothing overlaps anything, like the 257 here, so...
@_date: 2018-05-21 16:39:03
"00212121" =\&gt; [
Or maybe that was supposed to be the original hint, to be found there in the blockchain.
@_date: 2018-05-20 18:14:57
Username checks out
@_date: 2018-05-20 11:34:42
Wow, I didn't think in that direction, maybe you're on to something! I will now go back to some of my tries and try them with derivation path 257. Although that would seem too hard for a puzzle, because who knows about derivation paths...
@_date: 2018-05-22 05:26:01
Exactly, thank you.
@_date: 2018-05-21 07:43:07
That probably just means that the font doesn't have the smiley. It should be the same with Alt\+1, Alt\+2, Alt\+3 etc.
@_date: 2018-05-31 15:51:51
How do you change the numbers other than the last one?
@_date: 2018-05-20 09:14:08
Yeah, I thought maybe the private key is on the back of the hard copy, so the only way to solve the puzzle would be to buy it :D
@_date: 2018-05-26 08:57:47
Just to check, you *do* know that exactly those 5 angles are the default setting in the generator?
@_date: 2018-05-20 13:54:34
So because this is an address which starts with a 3, does that mean we have to find at least two seeds/private keys? Or exactly two, because of the "pair" hint.
@_date: 2018-05-20 09:47:58
I meant to test _your_ combinations, what you think may be the solution, not all random ones.
@_date: 2018-05-20 15:54:09
I think this is the best guess regarding the "pair" clue. But we are still missing the order of those 6 pairs.
@_date: 2018-05-22 03:49:16
Good information. I just think all of you are confusing private key and seed. Shouldn't each address have its own private key? So this new address can't have the same private key, only the same seed.
At least it's confirmed that we're not looking for a private key, but a word seed, because the address changed and the puzzle stayed the same.
Oh and there is "257" in the whitepaper, written like this: [7][2][5]
@_date: 2018-05-22 06:09:56
If all clues are still relevant, [as OP said]( it means that none of them were related to the passphrase/derivation path/whatever was the next step. Which leads me to think that the puzzle is set up in such a way that once someone finds the correct words, they will have a pretty good idea how to do the second step, which makes the easing of the puzzle by removing the second step strange, especially since it seems that no one has even got that far. Or if "Try +1" is now annulled, then it's not true that all clues are still valid, or OP doesn't consider that an official clue.
Also, regarding OP's comment "[it will not affect current progress]( - if what was removed was a passphrase or a derivation path, then it *will* affect current progress, because we have tested seeds without passphrases and different derivation paths, which means we would have to try everything again, in the search for the new address. Unless we are way off about the thing which was removed, but I'm not sure how can the second step be completely separate from the first.
@_date: 2018-05-21 07:39:03
Hmm, but you didn't highlight all the small BIP39 words, like *define* and *stay*. So for 3 I think "define paper" makes more sense, as in writing a whitepaper.
Also, there are a lot of large BIP39 words like *zero*, *run*, *order*, *must*, *proof*, *try* etc. I know the clues so far have all been small words, but who knows.
@_date: 2018-05-20 13:31:02
Interesting. Those coordinates are definitely too round for the X to be there randomly. But what to do with it...?
@_date: 2018-05-21 14:13:14
And from the clue "infinity and **beyond**" the line goes to the number 24, maybe that was just the clue that we're looking for 24 words.
@_date: 2018-05-24 16:46:51
What if the seed is only 12 words, and we are missing just 3 more pairs? Or it could be 18 words too.
@_date: 2018-05-26 10:46:15




Wut. They're all in the whitepaper, just without the apostrophe. The word cloud generator cut off the apostrophes.

Oh, thanks, I forgot about Segwit, lol.
@_date: 2018-05-21 07:44:31
I would assume the derivation path is 0. If not, then there must be a way to find it in the puzzle.
@_date: 2018-05-20 11:12:49
But it's paid marketing, a whole $8000, so I don't have a problem with that :)
@_date: 2018-05-20 11:39:16
Then feel free to do the same for your product :) I would love more puzzles like this.
@_date: 2018-05-20 09:18:40
Try it here: 
It will tell you when the seed is invalid, and you can quickly try other combinations.

Except about a 100 others here in the comments.

The notdef glyph appears in multiple places when you copy the whitepaper text here.
@_date: 2018-06-01 10:37:04
Thank you, that's it! Now I've also learned about these derivation concepts \(Account and Change\).
@_date: 2018-06-01 10:39:20
Again, I know that... If it's not BIP49, it would not start with a 3... See [here]( for the answer I was looking for.
@_date: 2018-06-01 09:56:11
I know, I am using that tool every day for hours lol, but in the derivation path text field I can't enter anything other than a number, which will just change the last section of the derivation path. So I can do this: m/49'/0'/0'/0/257 but not this: m/49'/0'/21'/21/21
@_date: 2019-10-19 16:43:31
I know, but many have invested enormous amounts of money in mining farms, so the moment it becomes unprofitable, a waiting game begins, where miners operate with losses, waiting for smaller miners to quit because it's not profitable anymore, so that they can continue mining with profit. Also, BTC price could be in a constant rise, so today's loss may be tomorrow's profit, if they wait before they sell their bitcoins for fiat, so some miners could take that risk. Many would turn off the machines but will not sell them and then turn them on again when it's profitable.
If Bitcoin becomes much more popular, I doubt there will be decrease in miners / mining difficulty. Even if only giant mining farms survive, they would still invest in buying more miners to stay competitive with other big mining farms and of course to have an edge on finding the next block.
@_date: 2019-10-19 14:39:14
But I was wondering, if it's agreed upon that the fees will then be more valuable (in fiat), will that be enough for miners to still be able to mine profitably? Because if today they get $100k per block and the block can have about 2000 transactions, does that mean that when there are no more newly generated bitcoins (or very little), one average transaction fee will be about $50 (100.000/2.000)? Or many miners will have to quit if it's less than that?
@_date: 2018-06-26 09:12:20
I'm with you man, I still didn't find an answer, not even in the replies to this comment of yours. It's like I'm going crazy. Is it possible that people are so uneducated about technology behind Bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-07-15 19:28:14
You are kind towards the other commenter, but I don't think your comment was "in addition" to the other one, it's the opposite. :)
@_date: 2018-04-26 16:26:18
I can't buy things in exchange for silver. So either we imagine those elements are spendable like cash, or (maybe easier) imagine that fiat currencies cannot be printed arbitrarily.
But my point was that Bitcoin could be a digital store of value and not be used so much in everyday life, just like gold, and it would also have scarcity like gold does. It doesn't matter how valuable are other cryptocurrencies (or what is their limit) for Bitcoin to have value based on its own 21M limit.
@_date: 2018-04-26 15:31:26
I would look at it this way: Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies would compare between themselves as gold and fiat currencies compare today.
@_date: 2019-05-24 17:40:03
Thanks! Wow, it seems way too easy for someone to just buy a popular paper wallet generator website and then change the closed source code so that it collects the generated private keys. It doesn't matter how much money the owner asks for because the potential is immense to say the least, especially since paper wallets are often made for cold storage, for storing large amounts of bitcoins.
I always thought that open source and Bitcoin devs like Canton would never "sell out" and that they can be trusted, kinda because they are nerds (in a good way). And this ownership change was basically silent, it surely went unnoticed by many, including me, and I used and recommended that website multiple times.

But "publicnote" is only 10 chars long and AES 128 requires 16 chars for the secret key. How did you get this, please?
