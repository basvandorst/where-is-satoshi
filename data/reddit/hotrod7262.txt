yes but is the price at open directly correlated to the BTC price at market open?

which brokerage allows it?

What is the CXBTF to BTC ratio?  i.e. if BTC is at $6300 tomorrow at market open, can we predict the opening price of CXBTF?

fuck this..more fees, no stop orders

He's on the Let's Talk Bitcoin podcast regularly

it's actually been done. Somebody find the source.
@_date: 2019-06-11 09:38:20
I think so but alas it's fake news

And you can invest in GBTC through an IRA account which is a big draw for a lot of people
@_date: 2018-02-12 10:34:28
Same here. Could you keep us in the loop?
@_date: 2018-02-17 12:20:33
but everytime you buy more aren't you paying fees?

Momentum. Catching a falling knife is a fools game.

there are people who bought all along the way down from 19k. Most of them are still negative.  Safer strategy is to wait for a confirmed bull market to return and ride the momentum.

just to be clear, I'm talking about the public in general, not me specifically.  And we know that when prices rise we see a surge in interest in bitcoin. The contrary is true as well.

I like the idea of making verbalizing quantities of bitcoin easier. I think it can mostly be done through education and some human readability added to wallets and exchanges.

Its a way to get exposure to the price fluctuations of bitcoin without actually holding bitcoin. It is traded on the stock market so easy to invest by average joes...even through retirement accounts.

GBTC also sells through retirement accounts which are tax deferred

Yes, bots are built on assumptions that if not true could result in unpredictable behavior.

Called the bottom on Dec 17th and noted what a great story it would be that the bottom was hit exactly one year after the ATH:
