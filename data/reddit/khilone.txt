Its only a few hours since the release and there are already over 10-15 media outlets who picked up the story. Its on the top on r/bitcoin and r/cryptocurrency as well. Lots of exposure in a lot of investing and trading groups and twitter as well.
But I agree it should be on cointelegraph, coindesk etc. So hopefully we will see that tomorrow.
First of all there is tons and tons of documentation for Tumblebit.
Next to that Stratis made all the documentation on how to use the wallet and how to set up a masternode, in a way that’s easy for everyone.
Maybe you should read the release and documentation first before you comment.

No it's not, it has to be ran outside of the wallet. Its in the user guide

The Breeze Privacy Protocol is a C# implementation of TumbleBit, the code is open source and you’re welcome to review the code on GitHub: [ In terms of time, a cycle will take 117 Blocks to fully complete, that equates to around 19.5 Hours, however, more than one cycle can be active at once. The level of privacy correlates with the number of cycle participants, so in general the more simultaneous cycles each user has, the better it is for the participants as a collective. The cost to an end-user is 1.55% + initial transaction fee. At the moment, there is no coin analytics research that has been undertaken, however, this is something the team will be looking into. Work is also being considered to design a system to coordinate cycles in a decentralised fashion. This will enable users to elect to participate in cycles with the greatest possible number of fellow users.

As acetmesis already explained it a bit, I would like to add an article which shows you more about that:
‪Decentralizing Privacy for Bitcoin: The Breeze Wallet, TumbleBit and the Future of Scaling  
Next to that I would add that in the future Stratis could be a testbed for things that may be implemented in bitcoin.

Stratis has developed a full node implementation of Bitcoin in C# and .Net core. With extensive test coverage, a modular architecture and utilizing much if the work from Nicolas Dorier his NBitcoin.

The goal of the breeze wallet is to get privacy for Bitcoin. Breeze uses the Tumblebit technology for this! On 1 August all information will be there!
Important side note this is the mainnet release, Stratis started working on this one year ago!

Its privacy for bitcoin, would be weird if they asked for personal stuff.... So no that’s not the case
@_date: 2018-07-25 21:18:22
So the official documentation will be released on 1 August. You can find all the requirements in there.
There will be a blog released on the website -&gt; 
And offcourse there will be a tweet on the official Stratis twitter account -&gt;
