What's the problem? 
Beyond paranoid junkies around here, mules :-) LOL there's a good reason people don't want to be caught on security cameras. 
And that's it.
You, for example go there,  deposit, go on camera. Eventually you can be targeted by extortion or some legal police investigation. 
In both cases, all you have to do is show a picture and name of the guy, and YOUR problems are over.

Bitcoin transaction less than 20 cent fee.
LN is 3 cents. :-)
Didn't know eh Misuri guy?? Trading rabbit tails for second hand chewing gum is easier??  :-)
On the other hand my nearby bitcoin ATM sells me bitcoin of 5% above going rate, maybe $4200 , and I intend to sell at 100'000 so about 23 times profit.
Bitcoin is bad then??

Mining - doesn't matter. 
Bitcoin issuance is set in stone :-) almost :-)
Crack the private keys??
You must be totally unaware how big a private key is: let me explain. To brute force a key will take more computing power than energy in this universe is available. 
Say 50000000000 years using all thousands suns energy. 
To randomly stumble on a random bitcoin key may take considerably shorter :-)
Say 50000000 years only.
Yes I'll risk it :-)

It's theoretical cap, right??
Remember the 2-3 millions coins either lost or slammed shut in safe for next generation. 
My next generation can rely on 1-2 bitcoin for sure.
So really, pricewise, the tradeable coins are much fewer. If 50 coins are bought tomorrow for 1 million $$ each??  :-)
Here you go- market cap 1 million times 17500000 is 17 trillion.

@_date: 2019-01-16 21:39:23
Market cap is false metrics. 
Let me explain.
I'll start my own coin. I'll premine 20 million coins. I'll list on Shmooexchange.noone.com :-)
...  I'll ask my buddy to buy 0.001 coin for 1000 dollars. 
And just like that price (LOL) is 1 million and cap is 20 trillion. 
Oh sweet I'll be rich :-)
Or not??
The same logic applies to bitcoin. There's about 1 million bitcoins that are traded in a day or week or whatever. 
The moment the price jump, the supply of tradeable coins will dry out.
Why would I sell for $6500 when i can sell for $40000 next 2 months?? 
Noone says that 1 million coins will be sold every day, adding trillions in a year time. 
The limited trade will actually push up the price and one day 1 bitcoin will be bought for $1 million, thus topping the 20 trillion cap, without actually being invested 20 trillion $$.
@_date: 2019-01-14 20:37:01
No. :-)

1 bitcoin..... You know :-)

Because.... 
Well the simple answer (that 98% of the dumb general populace won't like) is it HAS TO grow massively in price. 
To absorb the fiat/stocks /debt bubble, that's been bubbling 90 years.
Look Friday USA treasuries.... Look stocks last 6 months..... Look debt levels. Full  22 trillion $ and growing by the day (that's 1 trillion a year.).
....and keep inflating the bubble... 
So what are you gonna hold - American debt (LOL) or bitcoin???? 
Simple eh.
@_date: 2019-01-16 21:57:43
Bitcoin is limited. Fiat, Trump, Yellen, Draghi, what's new FED guy they printed 10 trillion fake "money" in 9 years.
I'll get 20 million Bitcoins anyday instead.
Divide, you'll see 0.5 million pricetag.
Except TOMORROW they will print another $10 trillion. 
And tomorrow there'll be only 1.5 million Bitcoins LEFT.
FOREVER!!!!

Money, which is fiat is super inflationary . 
If you have $3000 in your bank, next decade it'll be CERTAINLY worth only 1500 (inflation baby :-( ). 
If you put 3000 in bitcoin you'll have between 0 and 500000.

Think as an investor, not as a chicken with 12 months to live.  
The next high will be at 150000 dollars at a minimum when big funds like Blackrock, GS, Fidelity invest their humble 2-5-10 trillion in bitcoin.  :-)

Compared to fiat and gold - bitcoin has many advantages. 
Yet one drawback - you send a wrong transaction and cannot run to your bank or police to help you. 
So be smart....and NO NEGATIVES!!! 
@_date: 2018-02-18 20:16:50
I fully agree!!!!
Scarce is scarce. BTC is not BTG....BTX....BTZ...
Something more - I'll post my original, PRICE JUSTIFICATION!!!! post, that these moderators try to hide for reasons unknown.....  They don't even move it, just hide?!?!?
One other post dissappeared after 19 comments???  Why??
My umpteenth (after ....... not appearing?) big post :-) And likely my last. I'm tired.
I'll present my view on Bitcoin adoption e.g. as investment/hold/use/trade... . All other cryptocurrencies, while many, will be dealt with as fraction of the market cap. So my forecast will be about bitcoin - the rest will move in similar price or %%.
First assumption (A for short) - Bitcoin as a blue blood will stay as 20% dominance.
Second assumption (A) - looking only 2-3-5 years ahead.
Third A. - these A are just assumptions!!! You don't need to go berserk! :-) And don't bother if you have silly questions.
Forth A - in popularity bitcoin will equal Gold, but will beat it in utility, easy trade etc. Everybody knows how great and beneficial crypto is compared with phony paper, stocks or gold bricks.
Fifth A - people will assign 10-15% of their wealth (who has wealth only) to crypto coins.
Let's start ;-) with the money ;-) Who has money??? Of 8 billion about 4 billions own very little. Sorry to say it. :-S If you have $1000 in the bank you're relatively RICH.
Of the other 4 billion people I think only 10% are middle class. So 400 million CAN AFFORD to invest. See assumption 4. Next - many of these are old, retired, scared to invest. :-//
So 200 million people that MIGHT INVEST. Remember 1st assumption? Let's say 40 million will INVEST IN BITCOIN. ...
How much?? I think the average middle class will have $100000 assets. I say average!! So they can invest 10000 in bitcoin.
When?? In few months or years when adoption is wide. :-) I won't repeat again how great and beneficial crypto is.... So that's the demand side.
How about supply?? There's 17-18 million bitcoins. Of these 2-3 million are forever lost. See assumption 3. So we can trade 15 million Bitcoins.
Some people or hedge funds will just HODL. Keep in safe for 5+ years. No sale!!
Let's go personal....
Judging by myself, I'd sell 1/3 of my coins at 25-35k price. I'd keep 1/3 for my kids. I'd sell 1/3 at "high price ".!! What about you??
What's "high price " ??? ;-) Let's find out.
If 1/3 of bitcoin are redistributed in the next 2 years (middle adoption) and 1/3 in following 3 years ....then we're discussing only 5 million bitcoins that will be investment portfolio between 2020-2023. Ok? Assumption 2, 3, 4.
So let's see. 40 million people will try to invest $10000 in bitcoin. Available are 5 million bitcoins. The AVERAGE PRICE then is $80000. It's a fair deduction.
It could be reached earlier too... earlier than 5 years which i see as stable price period.
Today is 18 Feb 2018. Since the bitcoin dominance is not certain, a purchase of other coins is ALSO ADVISABLE.
Thanks for reading!!

What are you talking about???
Why don't you send me your thin air??
Value is an agreement between a buyer and seller!!! 
If 1 BTC cost $11000 that's it. 
You split it (among exact same investors)  and 1 new will cost 500, 1 original 10500. 
Tomorrow new investors come, price goes up 12000. That means someone dumped gold/oil to buy bitcoin.... 
Using your questionable laughable logic then gold and oil DISSOLVED into thin air.....
Utterly silly. 
And in your bank, 1-3% interest?????

There was the Greek or Cyprus crisis. Yes.
They robbed people of their money, bitcoin jumped. 
@_date: 2018-12-05 17:25:00
Hope you heed my advice and sue the sweet out of them IN YOUR COURTHOUSE. 
Not paying money to shister lawyer to fly around?? 
@_date: 2018-12-05 17:50:08
So let's say they want the money. 
You ended with 1200 bitcoin?? 
How many did you start with??
@_date: 2018-12-09 23:04:26
Buy little chunks, keep years.
Sell top (frenzy). 
Add. Repeat. 
@_date: 2019-05-17 13:05:14
Is not?? 
Ask the slu.ty girls around town :-)
@_date: 2019-05-08 05:28:07
Bitcoin in your pocket!! 
Easy :-)
@_date: 2018-12-06 06:49:36
And average your entry.
Buy few today, next month....
@_date: 2018-12-08 22:54:48
...is what your mom said about your willy.
@_date: 2018-12-05 17:48:12
You, being the customer, can sue them at their address or at your RESIDENT CITY.
Seems no brainer question :-)
@_date: 2018-12-05 17:45:18
Still. 
20 minutes to move, 2-3 confirmations extra..... Seems risky to me.
You started with how many bitcoins?? 
@_date: 2018-12-05 23:37:45
This guy is on reddit since at least 6 months.
Why it says 3 months?? 
@_date: 2018-12-10 23:10:21
You don't know who have been there :-)
@_date: 2018-12-08 17:28:43
Imagine such a retard!!
Listen poor pennyless jock.
You put 1 euro in the bank....
Interest is 1 cent. OK?
So the value of this euro is.... 20 cent??
Using the average expectations of P/E of 20. 
Listen more sad r....d.
You put gold in a depozit safe or fund, you pay 0.3%.  Every year. OK?? Poor soul!!
So according to your dumb logic gold cost negative $80??
Can't help brainless people :-)

@_date: 2018-12-05 15:41:11
Next cycle 200'000 high. 
Next 2 million high.
Next in 2030 we could see 20 million per bitcoin (ok sounds funny) that could crash to 1 million -)
@_date: 2019-05-17 13:06:05
Think 3 days
@_date: 2018-12-10 23:17:43
Don't get it?? Ok. Example.
Millions of people buy GOLD.
@_date: 2018-12-10 15:17:25
Correct,  small difference. 
I buy with part of my savings and other profits.
Always have, always will.
When next FRENZY is confirmed, maybe at 150'000 I'll sell couple bitcoin... 
Buy lower....
Repeat.  :-)
@_date: 2018-12-09 13:46:23
...is what your mom tells you daily.
My condolences. 
@_date: 2018-12-05 23:13:22
If you're joking say so.
You don't sound smart enough to be obvious for understanding. 
Example though - Poloniex was bought by a hedge fund.  Why?? :-)
It's the future. 
@_date: 2018-12-10 15:20:47
Part sell, you bumbledump, part sell.
@_date: 2018-12-09 13:19:43
Light wallets, mobile etc for beginners. 
There's plenty in PlayStore. Pick good one. Backup. Done. 
No need to listen to high priests about Full Node or else. :-)
@_date: 2018-12-09 22:48:23
Imagine being this retarded. 
Mt.Gox anyone?? 
China seizing it's bitcoin?? 
@_date: 2018-12-08 22:04:09
Electric motors for cars.
Tesla himself started this 200 years ago.

He has Bitcoin SV. ;-)
Phone has 5000000 GB on it
@_date: 2018-12-02 16:56:05
Who are you lying to??
I sent a transaction with 0.00001 bitcoin fee and it was done in 25 minutes!!
That's 4 cents fee.
Half an hour!!
So did you forget the fee, and forget to say so, liar each way??
@_date: 2018-12-04 16:35:30
The ignorant will always be billions :-)
@_date: 2018-12-05 17:36:24
They might be under wraps. 
Anyway, point is simple: get a lawyer, write a letter demanding 20% monthly interest and your bitcoin. 
@_date: 2019-05-11 15:12:11
That's the most awesome voice, monkey and lyrics :-)
It can't be more awesome :-)
I guess breach of $10001 would do it.
@_date: 2018-12-09 13:09:43
Few coins here or there could be left. 
Convenient place to buy alt-coins.
Of course, keep most within your domain.
We don't know when next breach could be.
Your lovely government, Venezuela, Gabon, Greece can seize them. Remember Cyprus!! 
@_date: 2018-12-06 06:43:49
You are stupido!!
So saving money in fiat??
What's the inflation??  What's the bank charges (you stupido might not see them, 3% stupido). 
So bitcoin is ONLY 3700.... and that's bad how??
Gold is 3000 years old and is only $1240. That must be horrible!! 
@_date: 2018-12-05 17:43:12
What details YOU NEED??
You need your coins, a deposit amount, few transactions, emails. 
So you need to sue them and along the way you have discovery, put motion for disclosure...
@_date: 2018-12-05 23:07:51
Bitcoin $3700 now. 
Buy now, lose 3690 or win 96000. 
Where's the problem in buying it??
@_date: 2019-05-27 17:54:19
This picture is meant to be PRO-BITCOIN :-)
Hence the title :-)
All aboard!!
Note only small news propelled bitcoin 10% up.
Imagine when ETF...Bakkt, Pension funds.... global embrace. 
I won't sell until 50'000. 
Ok I'll sell fraction. :-)
@_date: 2018-12-05 23:06:32
Crashy old pensioners :-)
But they don't decide.
Brash young managers, eager for 10 million bonus money, they DECIDE. 
Just wait.
@_date: 2018-12-06 14:34:27
500% is nothing exceptional . 
If next wave follows the 2014 pattern, then 200'000 is next (possibly in 2020/21).
@_date: 2018-12-09 23:03:11
Too complicated, it's garbage that neither smart not dumb people will get, or read till the end.
Sorry. 
@_date: 2018-12-05 22:36:01
5 billion?? 
Are you saying the tribes in Africa and Amazon use bitcoin?? 
Good one!!
@_date: 2018-12-08 22:20:47

His mom caught him with his dingus in the apple pie.
No he wasn't watching American Pie.
So he's banished to the basement, with a jar of petroleum jelly and an old computer :-)
So he writes a lot :-)
@_date: 2018-12-05 15:02:03
I won't lose a minute, talking to you.
Just 1 advice!!
Go to your mom, tell her she's a brave woman, to have you, to keep you, and sadly to raise you.
Very bad job. :-)
@_date: 2018-12-06 14:42:53
Bitcoin combines the currency, the value asset, the network. 
You can buy a coffee, 5 planes, or lock it in a safe for your grandchildren.
@_date: 2018-12-09 13:52:42
But be realistic. 
Bitcoin fell from 19000 to 3000.
Sooooo how far more is there??  :-)
Should we say 'stagnant market '??
And I'm not selling, not when a midnight surge (China attack Korea) can double this from maybe 2500 to 5000.  :-)
@_date: 2018-12-10 21:21:09
...they'll be paying people to take it...
Same with your mom, she occasionally pays me :-)
@_date: 2018-12-10 19:27:06
Exactly. 
Read here deep thoughts. 
@_date: 2018-12-06 14:26:32
When 10000 teenagers on silly website tell you to sell, what do you do :-)
@_date: 2018-12-06 16:08:25
My car speed is volatile. So.....??
With 5-6% loss the stock market has dumped over 5 trillion in the drain. :-)
Let them lose another 45 trillion and the Bitcoin grass will look very green. 
Am I right or idiots will downvote me again??
@_date: 2019-05-17 13:07:18
Are you stupid?? 
1 bitcoin WAS less than a cent.
Context pup, context :-)
@_date: 2018-12-08 22:13:11
Gold holdings in bank or a trezor  bear negative interest. 
Everyone knows that??
Money deposited in ECB vaults carry 0.4% negative interest. 
You know that right??
So 1 euro deposited in ECB will have a negative value of 8 cent (average market expectations). 
@_date: 2018-12-05 15:17:58
But he's right.
What's wrong with you?? Are you 12??
@_date: 2019-05-11 22:34:59
Source: your mom.
Had a great night. Say thanks. :-)
Viva la bitcoin :-)
@_date: 2018-12-08 22:55:38
...is what your mom said in my bedroom. 
Was nice night. Twice :-)
@_date: 2018-12-10 21:18:52
I guess silly people downvote?? 
@_date: 2018-12-04 17:10:17
So true.
But your heroic effort to explain bitcoin advantages to some.....are hard.
Just tell them - tomorrow you'll lose 3% of your money to INFLATION. 
And 3% to bank charges. 
How's that bitcoin horrible now, with potential for $50'000 as many say??
@_date: 2018-12-05 22:47:13
In Reddit we find fun :-)
I tried to match his dumbness against a 2 day old snail.
The snail turned to me and said "get  a real boy, not Pinnoccio".
@_date: 2018-12-08 22:06:25
And the atomic physics.
Atoms e.g. neutrons etc were suspected by Plato and other Greeks. 
1700 years later, we saw the atom core, then atomic bomb.
@_date: 2018-12-05 22:37:34
Let's see.
Say 100 million users of LN. No biggie. :-)
They open a channel every month (let's assume). So 3 million transactions a day. Just recorded on-chain. Ok??
That's 35 transactions per second on blockchain. Bad :-)
Cost of transactions will go up. So people will start open/close every 4 months.
Here we go 9 transactions per second. Problem solved itself. :-)
@_date: 2018-12-08 21:13:27
7 years ago bitcoin was 0.01 dollars, today $3400. 
Can't you see how retarded you are??
@_date: 2018-12-09 13:14:08
Yes easy. 
Yes secure - Ledger the best. Of course you need the BACKUP to be safe too. 
I think you need Chrome and just open inside. Keys stay on Ledger.
@_date: 2018-12-09 13:12:02
Some of these thieves of exchange charge me 1-2% and cheat with conversion. 
A normal exchange takes only 0.15-0.25%.
Depends what you need.
@_date: 2018-12-02 17:24:24
Year or two. 
Remember 2014-16 slow motion. 
But yes, upward is the only way. 
Look at stock market, just look.
90 years continuous growth, how funny, with fake money.
Today we have true NOT INFLATABLE coin(s). Let it grow for 5-15 years and we will be at 1 million $. 
@_date: 2018-12-08 17:18:10
Your brother has a video on you with your dingus stuck in a cactus. 
Now that DIGITAL video made him famous, when selling it at $5 per view. :-)
See, so far $702.5 profit. 
The 2.50 come from your mom. Family discount. 
I'm bored. :-)
@_date: 2018-12-05 18:21:18
You need to tell your mom, she made bad decision to HAVE you and KEEP you.
Poor woman. :-)
@_date: 2018-12-06 15:57:29
Survival of the fittest. 
Not only bitcoin forks!! 
Also investors - the guy who bought at 18800, does he deserve to be 'surviving ' if he's that unfit.
So just relax, enjoy the show.
Market is for slow moving sharks.
@_date: 2018-12-10 23:12:41
...is what you asked the mirror. 
Silly people are rarely rich.
@_date: 2018-12-06 06:54:41
Ok :-)
Debit, credit, all the same. 
You pay yours every month??  So same cash.
One day hopefully bank cards will go the way of telegraph - only in museum :-)
@_date: 2018-12-08 17:23:44
price-earnings ratio??
Retarded idea.
What are you talking about,  is bitcoin some stock in overinflated company?? 
Is Bitcoin a Walmart or Texaco??
Ok, here. For slow minded.
What's the price-earnings ratio....of gold?? 
Gold cost zero??  Not likely.  :-)
Such an idiot. :-)
@_date: 2018-12-06 19:27:36

How would they know these EXACT 1200 B are coming?? 
@_date: 2018-12-04 17:06:40
You can have a node on a Raspberry Pi.
Cost about 150 dollars, mostly the hard drive.

@_date: 2018-12-10 15:13:18

WTF is that about??
@_date: 2018-12-09 22:52:57
I calculated. 
100 million people can open channel every 4 -5 months and bitcoin blockchain will cope (SegWit of course). 
@_date: 2018-12-05 15:42:56
Your friend can sell me his bitcoin at current price plus 100. 
Then he can watch going to 50-150'000.
@_date: 2018-12-05 15:03:58
Clarify. 
What, how,  when is taxed??
I have full tank of gas. Do I pay taxes??
@_date: 2018-12-10 23:14:25
When bitcoin goes to 150'000 he can hire you to lick the dishes :-)
Go outside and start practicing :-)
@_date: 2018-12-06 14:53:47
That's stupid picture. 
You invest in crypto, not throw money.  Next year you'll have more.
You throw money at Walmart, you'll never see these money.

Analysts are just ANAL challenged people. 
Why ask the failed theorists, when you can sit back and relax.
@_date: 2018-12-06 11:58:03
Very small market.
Last I checked Gold is 8 Trillion $ market and heavy manipulated.
Bitcoin/altcoins is only 120 billion....
What can I say :-(
@_date: 2018-12-06 14:22:59
If bitcoin goes below a penny, then gold must cost 0.2 cent??
Good joke :-)
@_date: 2019-05-20 19:32:01
My guess is that 97% chance will rise (not measured between today and pay day Friday etc shortsighted bollock)  in the 12 months to come. Rise a lot!!
2% can fall.

People that first bought bitcoin on 15 Dec 2017 will feel ButHurt. 
Wait few years, sell at 100-150 thousands. 
Need time, stock market crash.  Easy.
@_date: 2018-12-05 15:20:40
How about a 'friend' leaking his name to a crime gang when the price is 100000 per bitcoin??

I wonder if you're serious. 
Yes futures are tradeable. But that's not really bitcoin.
I'd hold real.
I wonder, and help me everyone here, will there be a SEPARATION between a fitures and real bitcoin price??
What do you think?? 
@_date: 2018-12-05 22:28:03
Nice :-)

In 2014 I read a story (search bitcoin obituary)  about bitcoin, having fallen from 1200 to 300-400. 
The imbecile said 'trendline will soon connect bitcoin with zero value'.
Thinking,  this EXPERT would say that NOW the bitcoin price is negative 8000 dollars.

Ask SMART people. 
When T.Edison created the first light bulb it burned after 30 seconds.
He built the first factory with just 100 POSSIBLE customers around. 
Soooo :-) 
You think T.Edison and HIS CHILDREN were miserable and poor??
Your question revealed partial intelligence. Good. No joke.
Here's my answer. If bitcoin bottom out at $1000 I'll add 3-4 bitcoin. 
But if bottoms at $1 I'll add surely 300.
So I don't care where goes :-)  
It's a matter of perspective, pimply teenagers never heard of.

33'000 will be cheap.
That's 660 billion market cap. Only!!!
Compare to 'paper money ' which today stands at the horrible 35 trillion dollars. 
Gold only 8-9 trillion.
Bitcoin is like a 3-month baby compared to a 100 old crashing house.

Every day the number of 'bitcoin for sale ' shrinks, because smart investors buy them and throw in the safe.
So, one day after the regulations kick in, where's the price going?? 
@_date: 2018-12-05 23:31:00
Some buthurt downvoted us here too??
@_date: 2018-12-04 17:02:58
Really?? 
Let's see.
Total capitalization of 120 BILLION $ means nothing? 
Oh yes :-) 
6 years ago all the market cap was 3-4 billion. 
Growth?? 
How's your family business worth today? 
Your mom used to charge me a "150 dollars as a present ". I think :-)
Now she accepts 0.001 bitcoin. 
True story.
@_date: 2019-05-19 13:39:48
Also speculation.... 
Big investors (orders)...
@_date: 2018-12-10 21:05:22
I see it as possible 2019, certain 2020.
Will talk again :-)
@_date: 2018-12-09 13:31:52
Tell this to your mom when bitcoin goes 100'000 and your futures contracts make your mom sell her panties.
Nothing wrong trading, it's wrong preaching bumbledump. 
@_date: 2018-12-06 14:02:01
We haven't seen correlation so far.
I think it's the opposite. Let stock market crash 50%,  gold and bitcoin will up 1000%.  
I'm ok with that :-)
@_date: 2018-12-08 21:19:23
Did gold crash last month?? 
Let's see dumblehead??
Stocks 10% down, gold 2-3% up.
Is that not obvious??  Ane gold is like sh.t compared to bitcoin. 
@_date: 2019-05-04 21:35:30

@_date: 2018-12-05 17:14:52
As above
@_date: 2018-12-09 22:58:51
Do you expect sign in the sky telling you, retards, bear is over, buy today, borrow from your mom??
I didn't think so :-)
@_date: 2018-12-08 16:58:12
It is possible,  unlikely but possible. 
Think of the 1970s.
Computer big as a room. Phone attached to the wall with dial disk.....
Sooooo what happened :-)
@_date: 2018-12-05 23:21:11
Google it.
There's Wikipedia at bitcoin.it.
I think. 
But yes, equilibrium. 
Nobody (we the holders) cares if miners go out of business. Their problem.
When bitcoin was $600 two years ago, was there problem?? 
Here's your answer :-)
@_date: 2018-12-05 23:35:43
There was funny video.
Can someone explain, how I'm a 4 weeks Redditor, when i have a first post 290 days ago??
Is 290 days 4 weeks??
What a retarded site??
@_date: 2018-12-05 23:24:43
It's called FOMO.
We didn't sell (all) because of little tiny greed.
@_date: 2018-12-05 18:23:58
You can borrow from your mom, no doubt. 
You need to tell your mom, she made bad decision to HAVE you and KEEP you.
Poor woman. :-)
@_date: 2018-12-05 17:37:55
Surely he has more!!
@_date: 2019-05-17 21:07:24

@_date: 2018-12-05 18:04:38
All stupidity you said is exactly why bitcoin is the future money. 
You must be 8 year old. Go learn something. 
@_date: 2018-12-05 17:57:48
It's cyclical. 
Don't care where it goes in few years. 
Care to sell at 100000 after SEVERAL years.
@_date: 2018-12-02 17:04:23
Futures are not related to the underlying as you said.
Futures are just paper money, endless supply. 
@_date: 2018-12-08 22:57:16
Different perspective. 
Some see diamond where retards will see bunch of carbon atoms.
Can't appease all.
Tired of Your Mom jokes. :-)
@_date: 2018-12-05 17:33:49
Cold storage yes.
Finney phone?? 
Are you serious??  It's the whole Israeli spy department behind it, and CHECK THEIR WEBSITE!!! 
They say (quote from memory)  WE PROVIDE A SPECIALIST TO SPY ON YOU TO MAKE SURE NOONE IS SPYING. 
No kidding. ;) i might have altered 2 words BUT GO CHECK THAT Finney Phone (the secret concierge mode).
Phone cost 10000. Good investment?? 
@_date: 2018-12-05 17:29:24
What bag of snakes is that?? 
Binance has no legal address to be sued at?? 
Email only??  Every shister can contact everyone on fake email?? 
How about SMS??
@_date: 2018-12-06 06:46:19
So when do you buy??
So when 10% adopt it, where will the price be??
Maybe 37'000.
And then you, stupido, will say you bought the bottom, no doubt, and you'll be the smartest pig in your sty??
@_date: 2019-05-17 13:04:48
I have this....
And alarm @ 35k, 45k, 75k, 98k :-)
@_date: 2019-05-04 21:42:49
Between now and May 2020 when the halving is..... Will it go down or will it fly??
It's that simple :-)
@_date: 2018-12-06 19:37:50
Did you just invent "money from thin air"??
6% free money, how nice, and all created for you, noone bears the burden. :-)
I'm surprised people like this are allowed to buy a computer or able to press a keyboard. 
@_date: 2018-12-06 12:05:49
I know that we are all joking. 
Imagine negative price of Bitcoin.  :-)
I have 2 bitcoin and it falls, say, 10000 negative. 
They (who are they) will come and take my car /house??
The fun :-)
@_date: 2018-12-10 21:23:32
His comments (funny and long term) equal your (silly)  comments, but he is honest. 
I like him.
@_date: 2018-12-04 18:11:17
Does your mom know that the experiment of keeping you and raising you is not going great??
So when bitcoin was 1.34 dollars Buffet said bitcoin was a scam?? 
Wasn't bitcoin 4000 dollars today??
@_date: 2018-12-09 19:10:10
If you had brains then you would know that you can do EVERYTHING on your mobile ONLY. 
@_date: 2018-12-05 15:09:00
Are you that idiot they show on the news, who forgot about 1000000% up last few years??
@_date: 2019-05-11 22:33:35
I'd keep few bucks save so I'd buy if drops again to 4000.
And it's wise to cash some profit at $8'000 then 9500.
@_date: 2018-12-05 17:52:51
It's not criminal. 
He knows exactly who has the coins. 
So it's CIVIL :-)
@_date: 2018-12-10 15:13:51
I feel sorry for your mom. 
@_date: 2018-12-08 21:16:24
That's what your mom said. 
@_date: 2018-12-02 17:01:21
And i discovered that 80% of posts here are by idiots, probably young, stupid and unemployed. 
Sadly, in reddit there's no filter button to ban the losers.
@_date: 2018-12-05 17:19:56
Noone is asking you that.
Question is 'was there fraud before you get them in the exchange '??
Blockchain is public, you know??
@_date: 2018-12-10 15:11:05
It's all very problematic. 
I might expect 1500
@_date: 2018-12-05 23:23:18
Simple answer, we don't care.
As long as about 15 nodes are working,  bitcoin is working. 
@_date: 2018-12-05 23:00:48
Will read :-)
@_date: 2018-12-05 15:13:34
I'm occasionally quiet :-)
Occasionally indulge in 'yo mom' jokes.
I'm bored.
Waiting for $60000 as first sell point. 
@_date: 2018-12-05 22:33:03
Let's see.
Say 100 million users of LN.
No biggie. 
They open a channel every month (let's assume).
So 3 million transactions a day. Just recorded on-chain.
That's 35 transactions per second on blockchain. 
Bad :-)
Cost of transactions will go up. So people will start open/close every 4 months.
Here we go 9 transactions per second. 
Problem solved itself.
@_date: 2018-12-04 16:34:22
Are you talking about your mom??
Testosterone... Anxiety.... Misery...
@_date: 2018-12-10 15:14:53
...is what your mom said about someone... 
@_date: 2018-12-06 19:30:10
And Earth is flat... ;-)
And your mom is a 21 year blonde...
Gotcha :-)
@_date: 2018-12-05 17:12:25
So are you suing them?? 
Surely if you're right (and they lie) you take them to court?? 
@_date: 2018-12-05 18:17:59
You need to tell your mom, she made bad decision to HAVE you and KEEP you.
Poor woman. :-)
Institutional investors??  They need 2 things - adoption and regulations. 
Think!! 
20 years ago a group of malcontents with no brains said 'ATMs are too risky to install on the street. Bank office everywhere, Banks never fail'.
You see ATM in your toilet now!!
So just wait 2-4 years.
Bitcoin owners like me will have few bucks, you'll be the same malcontent loser, living with mom.
@_date: 2018-12-05 23:16:27
These experts are the gang of failed traders with IQ of worn shoes, that for 8 years were literally whining and pleading that bitcoin is dead.
No thanks.  :-)
You put your money in ECB coffers,  YOU PAY THEM 0.4%. 
Stupid??  No thanks. 
I'll go bitcoin way.
@_date: 2018-12-02 17:15:24
I can't advise people. 
All I say is I'll do what I did before. 
So sell at 35000, 55000, 75000 and 100000. 
I'll keep part for selling higher, and for my children. 
@_date: 2018-12-06 14:49:49
Try that for size.
Bitcoin has been growing for 9 years (that is from 0.01 cent to 20000 dollars). 
Do you see what you missed before?? 
You're not seeing the forest because of the trees :-)
@_date: 2019-05-19 13:38:43
Whatever :-)
Bad or good it's exposure!!!! 
Idiots won't buy anyway, the smart will grasp the importance. 
BTW idiots rarely have money.... So what's the problem :-)
@_date: 2018-12-05 22:55:36
Do you scan your 'wallet' on the right hand camera or what??
Increase the brightness. 
@_date: 2018-12-06 19:25:28
Correlation?? 
Look at gold, is it going down??
Stocks may spill 5% a day and go to zero next year (figure of speech)  :-)
When that happens where will be gold?? 
$100000 an ounce, like 0.3 bitcoin I guess.
@_date: 2018-12-06 12:08:40
I absolutely trust bitcoin (hope to buy lower if possible please).
But a little truth to throw here- few years back, the price of oil touched NEGATIVE. 
No joke, Google it.
Of course oil is bloated, dirty waste of resources, no future, but still amusing to think.  Think of Shell oil as enormous rich company?? 
Barrel of SPECIFIC oil was negative 2 dollars!! 
Anyone care to Google and post??
@_date: 2018-12-05 23:03:59
And think, if they (investors)  REALLY WANT TO BUY, would they TELL YOU??
Would they lie to you 'Doomsday tomorrow ' and fill their bags super cheap?? 
Just walk in their shoes.
@_date: 2018-12-06 06:56:07
You can settle once in 3 years if you wish. 
I provided calculations somewhere, saying 4 months is good number (just assumption).
@_date: 2018-12-05 18:20:32

You don't need to 'go' or 'fly'.
You just sue them in your own country. That simple!!

Who's helping you, how??

So if 1000 people decide to hold then 200 will do OK and 800 will do badly?? 
Did you inhale much tetrahocicylinephenel today??
@_date: 2018-12-06 14:04:45
Wrong. 
People were crying CORRECTION until 10'000.
Only under it (quick second dip) the screaming started.
So yes.
I bought at 7'000 then 5'000. 
It's amazing opportunity to buy cheap 7'000 sell at 99'000.
I'll be OK waiting. 
@_date: 2018-12-10 19:27:56
Now is different. 
Weak hands getting rubbed off :-)

There's friggin coins called LEND or something....
@_date: 2018-12-02 17:20:49
I sold part.
But it was FOMO that blocked me from selling, for example, half.
And looking at old charts it is indeed obvious. 
Better planning next time.
We can sell 150000 to 30000 next few years.
I'm making a note.
