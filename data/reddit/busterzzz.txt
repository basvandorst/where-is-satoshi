If core devs can't focus on their jobs and instead waste time on pushing their own agenda's they shouldn't be devs. 


I completely agree but what else do you expect in the &gt;Yeah, woo hoo. Peter can pretend he did something.
Once again my remark was sarcasm. You think I give a shit about hodl lock spend? I was referencing that because it's the only 'meaningful' thing I could think of that people got excited about in regards to bitcoin. I haven't seen anything else come out of the developer camp in the last year that is worth mentioning. Why? Because these guys sit here and debate on internet forums all day instead of programming. 
@_date: 2015-12-25 14:30:28
Because they need more time to debate blocksize.

Who develops side chains? 
@_date: 2015-12-25 15:38:46
Well my original comment was pretty sarcastic but it holds truth. Some of these projects that were supposedly going to "kill" altcoins cease to exist. Darkwallet, sidechains. 
Can developers hold meaningful discussions, probably. Have they? Doubtful.  
But it's all good we got that new hodl lock spent shit. Woohoo that's progress right there.

you login to ripple.com - you enter your bitcoin address into the send option. you enter the amount of xrp you want to convert to bitcoin. You hit send. Your XRP's are now bitcoin. Well, not instantly, you still have to wait for the slow bitcoin blockchain. If it was all inside ripple it would be done instantly, guess people just like to wait :) - oh and this is real by the way, its called the bitcoin bridge. Google it. Eazy Peezy.
@_date: 2014-01-26 07:40:49
your actually completely wrong. You don't have to trust anybody to convert your ripple into BTC. All you do is go to send, put in your bitcoin address, send ripple, and it magically turns into bitcoin. wow. No trust involved, It's called the bitcoin bridge, and I suggest you google it to fully understand the simplicity of the situation here.

As I got into bitcoin late, I've never seen it this low, and I'll be buying as much as I can as long as it's under 200$. I feel like this is the most amazing time for someone who came in late, like me. If it keeps going lower I keep getting cheaper coins. I'm so happy right now. I Seriously Hope It Goes To 70$

I understand your annoyance and maybe people agree with you but I must say that a lot of what is written/posted on the internet is taken out of context. YOU may have 'noticed' an annoying 'tone' in the post but some others may not have? I think Evan's intentions are genuine here and you wrongly accuse him/them of 'propping up the value of their coin' - which in reality is no where close to true, and in fact an annoying statement in itself. It's nice to have discussion but not when you sneak in low jab comments that hold no merit.

If we buy items from merchants who turn around and convert that bitcoin into fiat are we really helping the "economy"?

I actually downloaded that very same exact app and entered my credentials. But I didn't have any Bitcoin in my wallet initially, also didn't log in for a few weeks. About 4 days ago I logged in and deposited one Bitcoin. My account was instantly put on _"vacation"_. This is local Bitcoin version of locking an account. 
At first I was super upset because I was trying to sell a Bitcoin and my account was locked and I had no idea why. So I contacted support and asked them why I was on vacation. Support responded with the statement that I had _"downloaded a third party app that steals credentials and my account would remain on vacation until I reset my password and my two Factor Authentication"_. I did this and my vacation ended. 
I'd like to note that I was never contacted personally by local Bitcoin about why my account was put on vacation I'm not sure if this is a good thing or a bad thing. At any rate I was able to withdraw the one Bitcoin I had deposited. I still don't trust using that account so I started a new one but I never lost anything.
I'm really sorry for your loss keep your head up it's not the end of the world.

You obviously have no idea what your talking about, anything you say is null and void. We don't 'pay' for nodes. It's called collateral.

Everything you asked is public... you expect people to do your research? It has nothing to do with drk supporters. It has to do with the fact that your lazy and can't spend 15 minutes of your time to figure it out. Stop pretending like you give a shit. Your a troll beating a dead horse and the flies are gathering.

There is no law saying I must be 'nice' on reddit. You chose to babble and ask questions that have been answered repeatedly by numerous people over the last year... You in fact are just to lazy to go and google that. Your question was not* sincere because if you really cared you would go do the research and then ask questions. Instead you come here and spew bull-crap and continuously beat a dead horse, metaphorically speaking.  In Einsteins opinion you are literally insane. You come here asking the same questions expecting a different answer with different results, when that doesn't happen you cry and whine about how mean I am. Grow up buddy, go do some research, and leave the horse alone, it's already dead bub.
