Only 21 million BTC in 25 yrs.. yet the US$ money supply will double at least three more times by then.
@_date: 2019-11-12 12:10:09
what makes you think $1million USD will be valuable in 30 years?  The money supply is shooting up higher than Mt. Everest!

The dollar is backed by gold
Building 7 was dustified by office fires
The Fed is part of the US gvt
Gold's value comes from all its industrial use
Poor sad Americans :(

The first likable financial services commercial ever produced.

No problem.
"Globalism" sounds like a great idea (freedom, no restrictions, etc) but the deeper I dug, the more and more I figured out it's a bunch of uber-rich psychopaths (Epstien-types) who have slowly been growing their power to conquer the world.. in an evil way.

Globalism/One-World-Gvt/New_World_Order is essentially a totalitarian system with a tiny elite, elimination of individual cultures, eradication of the "balance of powers" concept.. and globalism has historically been led by families like the Rothschilds, Rockefellers, Soros, Koch, etc. Groups closely tied to globalism are the CFR, Tri-Lat Commission, Bilderburg Group. A big part of globalism is financial control through command of central banks.. not bitcoin.
If you really want to understand what globalism actually is, read Charlie Robinson's book "Octopus of Global Control."

yah.. I know. I was being cheeky.
It may take a long time to reach $1MM inflation-adjusted, but it's possible. Empirically speaking, bitcoin is a better SoV/MeansOfExch than gold.. and gold is worth $8tn without a fixed supply limit.
@_date: 2019-11-12 21:50:36
In 2008 it was at $8tn.
Today it's over $32tn.
Pretty sure a 4x over a business cycle is more up than down.. and just wait until what happens during the next recession.

Bill Gates is a globalist. Globalists say bad things about bitcoin.. because bitcoin is a threat to centralized control, a core theme of the globalists.

didn't the nordic banks- Danske Bank and Nordea Bank- get busted for money laundering last year for $200bn?  And they both wanted to ban bitcoin too. LOL.
@_date: 2019-11-12 22:14:34
well.. they'll try to pull off something and a decade from now, the $32tn will probably become $100tn.. and a decade after that $500tn.
Meanwhile, bitcoin stays at 21MM.

Read Saifedean Ammous' book The Bitcoin Standard and listen to his talk in Austria that was just posted. It's the best source. Since the removal of the gold standard 100 years ago, Bitcoin is the first opportunity to return to hard money as an alternative to the fractional banking system we have now.

It's CRITICAL because it explains why bcash exists and why Jihan has built/bribed a lying maniacal sock puppet mercenary army. Good news: Every day, r/bitcoin is adding 10x as many new people as r/btc and growing 3x as fast.

Yes, it costs $1,200 to get an oz out of the ground. I'm sure there are other things that are very expensive to get out of the ground but however have no market value once extracted.
The point is.. gold is just a metallic rock. If it weren't used as an SoV, it would be 99% worthless and thus, nobody would spend $1,200 to extract it.

We are going to have many more of these cycles before Bitcoin reaches its potential and becomes a multi-tn$ global currency. Every one won't be quite as bad as the last, but the gains won't be quite as much either. Invest an amount you can lock away for 3-5 years, don't try to out-trade traders, support the community, and promote Bitcoin as the global currency. If we all do this, it WILL work out. It WILL work out.
@_date: 2019-10-29 19:39:25
I always answer with.. the same is true with gold. 
Gold is a useless yellow rock. If it were priced on its industrial value, it would be $10-$20/oz. 99% of its value is due to its semi-scarcity.. thus its SoV status..
yet this useless rock backed by nothing is worth $8trillion.

Yes, great! Makes sense. I'm not sure if mBTC or the 1E-6 denomination is better (probably the mBTC for now). My main point is that emerging merchants like yourself who are starting to get huge press.. are going to be the leaders to drive adoption, and it's so important to consider the consumer experience of using btc and lightning. 
I DON'T want to live in a world where those wretched A*HOLES at btrash thrive because they are more consumer-focused than the bitcoin community. Good luck!! Looking forward to following your progress.. like launching the first consumer video game in the 1970s.

There needs to be SOME regulation. Scams like bitconnect and Ver's insider trading and bcash brand theft/slander are BS. They hurt 99% and only benefit a few (Ver, Jihan, Wright, etc.). However, the ecosystem needs to lobby and push for:
1) Tax crypto as a currency.. like the US dollar. Pay sales tax on purchases, not capital gains tax on gains.
2) Allow people to keep their crypto private. We don't need MORE surveillance. 
3) Regulating exchanges to make sure they are following basic protocol to protect users is a good thing. It makes it harder for the scammers.

great idea! perfect way to start testing it. can they change the denomination? 99% of the population can't comprehend numbers like 0.000283 vs 0.0000283.
