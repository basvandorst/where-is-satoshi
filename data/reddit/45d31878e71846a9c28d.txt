Doesn't really matter much though, it just means you have to go buy your own Bitcoin, really isn't hard.

You're misunderstanding what I was saying (not sure about the other guy's opinions). Transferring to Kraken isn't (and shouldn't be) dangerous, you can almost certainly sue as a last resort. But putting 45k in cryptocurrency (i.e. buying that much Bitcoin) is incredibly dangerous, unless that amount is somehow not important to you. Cryptocurrencies are some of the most volatile investments you can make, and while obviously I'm not telling you to stay away (I'm here, aren't I), you should be very careful about risking things you can't afford to lose.

It's not a matter of "inflation". Since 1980, the US stock market has had around 8 or 9 crashes, which for stocks means dips of 20% or more. 8 or 9, over 37 years. Meanwhile, Bitcoin has had nearly as many 60% dips in the 7 years it's existed, and countless 20% dips (two in the last three months). Does that mean Bitcoin is going to crash? No, but it's much, much more volatile than US stocks. That's not necessarily a bad thing, and if it were going up at similar rates it would probably be less volatile. But compared to other asset classes, there's a much higher chance of you being down 50% on a given day.
Risk mitigation just means having a mixture of less volatile and more volatile assets. This is an extremely smart thing to do. Any given investor has a certain level of risk vs reward tradeoff they're most comfortable with. As it turns out, balancing less risky but lower returning assets with more risky and higher returning assets lets you get higher expected return with lower expected risk than a homogenous portfolio could.
Now if for some reason you have no risk sensitivity, you're fine with losing everything, then might as well just go to Las Vegas. Otherwise, stay diversified in accordance with your personal risk aversion.

They're a very slow company, but so far all my transfers in and out have worked fine (eventually). Just wait a while longer and you'll almost certainly be fine. But you should absolutely not be putting "all your money" into any kind of cryptocurrency trading.

True that this is safe, but they have high fees and long waiting periods to move money in/out. I'd recommend using one of the more reputable "actual exchanges". GDAX or Gemini if you're in the US. GDAX is the same company as Coinbase but lower fees/not as user friendly.

I mean if you'd done it when the pump started and swapped back when it dumped, you would've made a good amount of Bitcoin. I ended up making ~0.3 BTC off the BCH pump, not even buying and selling at the "perfect" times.

This is required to prevent money laundering and tax evasion. Any exchange, stock broker, bank, etc will need this sort of information.
