Yeah idk if this one does but I’m thinking not
@_date: 2018-01-23 02:31:58
@_date: 2018-01-23 02:18:29
I sent it with .000012 BTC fee 
Idk how to identify the TX hashes and I don’t want to lose this BTC because I send the wrong info on Reddit lol
@_date: 2018-01-23 02:37:51
Damn...I am a cheap bastard lol.  
So basically I just gotta wait it out?
@_date: 2018-01-23 02:19:53
How do I find the txid on blockchain.info ?
@_date: 2018-01-23 02:16:35
It says unconfirmed on blockchain.info
@_date: 2018-01-23 02:35:27
Ok so what does that mean tho?  
Is the transaction always going to be stuck in this limbo?
@_date: 2018-01-23 02:23:53
Thanks for your help.  I mean it says I sent it with .000012 BTC fee which was $ .13 or .02% of total transaction.
If you tell me what the txid is I would send that info...where is that info on blockchain.info
@_date: 2018-01-23 02:39:06
The problem with that is that there are now 0.00 BTC in her wallet to “re-send”.  I think because it is still in the process of sending the other transaction.  
@_date: 2017-12-06 12:53:18
PleSe post link if possible.  Thx
@_date: 2017-12-01 01:33:51
Flagged that video for what it is...Spam.
@_date: 2017-12-06 13:17:54
Thank you.  I can’t watch live though ��
Is there another link to just the interview only?

How is taking profits and lowering risk being a bitch to the banks?  And if you think calling someone Warren B Jr is an insult your outlook is ridiculous.  He is one of the most successful investors in the last 100 years.  You can take money off the table to re-buy at more attractive prices (cough cough $3k-$5k), which is what the majority of people that bought in 2014-2015-2016 will be doing after selling in late 2017 and early 2018.  They will be buying back in either slowly or in rapid fashion once gaps are filled and regulatory sentiment is more clear.  Also, custody is not solved. Bakkt isn’t approved yet. And Goldman could be 6 months or more off of a legit custody solution to create solidity in the eyes of regulators that institutional investors won’t create systemic risk on a new asset class.  Get your head out of your ass and wake up.  Selling isn’t a bad thing.  Just like shorting isn’t a bad thing.  It creates liquidity and liquidity is necessary for a well formed full functioning asset to mature and become filling adopted.  Good day sir.

De-Risk selling is an important part of being a successful investor.  
@_date: 2018-09-07 03:29:28
Literally zero substance to anything you have said.  
I said good day sir.  Ohh and good luck too, I think you are gonna need it.

Loss Leaders.  Happens everyday in companies.  Boards and shareholders approve those types of decisions everyday.  But that’s not even the case with Bitmain.  They have plenty of cash flow and are making big AI investments for the future.  Again, they will be fine.
@_date: 2018-06-29 22:01:35
At times sure, but they are still making a ton of money overall.  Again, they can weather a LOOOOONG storm based on their profits from last year.  
@_date: 2018-06-29 19:25:01
With all due respect to your post and input.  
Bitmain made 3-4 BILLION dollars last year.  They might be losing some cash now, but they are fine and will be for a LONG time.

Expendable capital.

The media attention he brings is very valuable because he is a respected member of the publicly traded space as well as the tech space.  That is why people care what he thinks and why you should too.  Brining legitimacy to crypto is a good thing and we should welcome it. We do need people like Jack and we need less close minded people in this space.  
@_date: 2017-11-21 23:11:27
Looks like they have just an absolute horrible track record for solves issues relating to unconfirmed transactions associated with their app.  What info would you suggest involving in the "issue" submission?
@_date: 2017-11-20 16:30:49
a group of probono lawyers who are also hodlers should get together and class action Roger Ver's company on behalf of the BTC community and for the overall health of its future.  
@_date: 2017-11-07 00:44:02
All their servers upgraded.  Now it's not supported on chromebook.  I need to know how to download the desktop client.  Are you familiar with how to do that?
@_date: 2017-11-07 01:49:51
I decided that chromebooks suck.  
I'm returning it lol

@_date: 2018-02-26 18:48:27
Can you give me some examples of blockchains that have that function available?
@_date: 2017-09-10 16:02:25
Didn't work.  I still haven't gotten any help from Coinbase.  I am out of places to ask and get help.  Coinbase customer support awful.  I mean I know they have a ton of new users but still this is just terrible.
@_date: 2017-10-31 02:45:02
Like Woah.
@_date: 2017-10-28 14:22:37
I am feeling that way about my air dropped Bcash at this point lol.  Not that it truly matters because it was free BTC, but damn haha.  What's up with the rise the last couple days?
@_date: 2017-10-29 20:57:11
Bless your heart
@_date: 2017-10-29 22:22:12
Still lookin' flawless!  I'm out on this one, but in all seriousness...Good luck on your future trades with crypto!  
@_date: 2017-10-05 21:43:15
lost alot of respect for MC after he bashed BTC in the past.  Glad to see he has at least come around to BTC.  A lot of people will eventually do the same thing so the community needs to not be so harsh against these converts.
@_date: 2017-10-23 01:34:51
Most logical and real post I have read with regards to this whole scene in a long time.  Thank you. 
@_date: 2017-10-29 17:13:39
So it's Reddit, who cares.  Your civility goes out the door when you feel empowered to insult because you are sitting behind a keyboard?  that's a weak mentality if you ask me.  Like I said before, good luck to you, sounds like you are gonna need it.  
@_date: 2017-10-04 03:31:38
What makes you give that projection?
Very interested to hear from someone who obviously saw this as something of significant value back when not a lot of others did.  Please advise :)

I just got a mental image of all the major bank CEOs in a dugout...one by one they come out to knock Bitcoin out of "their" park.  And one by one they take swings at Bitcoin and one by one Bitcoin just keeps throwing heaters until they strike out.  First up with have "JP Morgan"...And he strikes out on a 100 billion dollar fastball right down the center of the plate.  Next up we have "Bank of America"...And strike one, strike two, strike three and he's outta here!  Sooner rather than later they will stop swinging and the smart CEOs will determine a way for their respective companies to survive and possibly still thrive in this new economy where Bitcoin is a major league player.  
@_date: 2017-10-13 01:19:56
Just curious as to the thought process on why you are holding BCH.  I sold most but kept some.  Just wondering what your reason is?
@_date: 2018-07-09 15:31:33
A friend and I have been working on real world use case for SC on BTC LN.  If you are interested in touching base about the idea in a professional capacity please message me.
@_date: 2018-07-01 19:27:13
For some reason I couldn’t send BTC to the website to play from my Coinbase account...does anyone know why that is?
@_date: 2017-10-11 21:03:36
How do you go about doing that without giving up sensitive info to banks?  
@_date: 2018-02-26 21:07:34
Is it only possible on Ethereum or is there a way to do it on the BTC blockchain using Rootstock tech?
@_date: 2017-10-29 03:57:46
No need for that kinda talk in here...good luck to you
@_date: 2017-10-28 21:07:04
Well yeah if I knew what I know now that would have been a great idea to sell higher lol.  Thanks for the pro tip

Link Coinbase and it’s actually pretty simple.  It was buggy when I originally posted.

I am using my head.  He started PayPal.  He is a significant shareholder and chief exec at multiple companies that require financial backing from the very shareholders and banks that stand to lose money if bitcoin is successful at any serious scale.  He has more to lose than gain by stating that he has any sizable holdings of crypto.  He has a laser focus on those types of very public financial disclosures.  Do I think he is lying?  Not necessarily, but possibly.  Do I think he is a master of PR?  Absolutely.  I also am very aware that there is absolutely no need for him to publicly disclose anymore than he already has...it’s smart for him to say what he said.  He is basically saying, (yeah I’m into the space a little.  I’m aware.)  He’s not going to say I’m not deep into it because it’s speculative and there is uncertainty and he doesn’t want to tarnish his business relationships on a speculative asset outside of his core business.  That would be silly.  Perhaps you should use your head...dude.
@_date: 2018-04-09 11:52:29
Unsure. Send to hardware wallet and then trade on local bitcoins?
@_date: 2018-04-04 15:56:48
Mark...If you truly don't want the billion dollars but end up getting it anyways.  Here is a suggestion...Buy $999 million dollars worth of bitcoin at market current market pricing.  Put that money back to the ecosystem and keep a million cash for yourself as a just in case fund for all the trouble and heartache that you have experienced as a result of this debacle.
