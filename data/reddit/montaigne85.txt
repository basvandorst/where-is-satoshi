"Separation of money and state" - that will often trigger their curiosity to look it up for themselves

Actually no need for local exchanges. Just provide the receiver with a Cryptex card, load it with  BTC and then the receiver can simply withdraw fiat from a local ATM in their home country.

Bought it too, with the sole intention to enjoy the pleasant feeling of using bitcoin.

Bitcoin debit cards already exists, see cryptexcard.com for instance.

Just move the decimal point and don´t change the name, ie a total of 21*10^12 coins still called "bitcoins"

Honestly, I think this actually might be the killer app we´ve been looking for that could trigger mass adoption.

You could co-work with coinbase and/or other exchanges, allowing the costumer to directly deposit fiat on your site (cutting the costumers step of having to buy btc from coinbase), but the fiat is going to coinbase instead while you receive btc from coinbase behind the curtains.

Try sending your third world cousin bitcoins for now to buy food with, gl.

China will try to do a 51% attack to test the robustness of bitcoin. If bitcoin passes the test then they might unban and proceed like the rest of the world. But not untill then. Thats how China works. Its a country ruled by engineers, as opposed to usa/europe which is runned by politicians (fragilistas).

Damn shame though that $10 is the minimum credit you can buy with bitcoin. They should lower it to $5, at least.

Obviously the fees will have to be favorable or otherwise no one will use their service.
