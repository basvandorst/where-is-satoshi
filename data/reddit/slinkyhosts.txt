Jack mentioned earlier in slack that the download server might be getting flooded with a ton of traffic. He said he may look for alternatives. But check your firewall and see if lnd.exe has been allowed through. Or just keep trying. 
@_date: 2018-01-28 05:04:13
If syncing the wallet is taking a while do not worry. The server has recently had a ton of traffic so it's being slow. Jack is spinning some more servers up as we speak and will be pushing an update soon.

"**But, sir, this not mainnet?**
No, this release is built for Bitcoin’s testnet. If you do some self-configuration, you can use Zap on mainnet, but Zap will not publish mainnet releases until the developers and greater Lightning Network community are ready.
It is the coolest feeling in the world to have people so enthusiastic and excited about what you spend your time passionately working on. I think this community’s desire to improve Bitcoin together each and every day is amazing. That said, I do not recommend mainnet usage until the protocol developers and the Lightning community as a whole encourage it.
Right now, the rapid mainnet growth is a bit worrisome. Many people don’t grasp some of the subtler costs and risks of using mainnet. Yes, you can lose your bitcoin, and that would be a shame, but the greater cost is the time and resources the main developers lose. I’ve witnessed first-hand some of the smartest developers in Bitcoin lose valuable time as they have to shift from being a protocol developer to a customer-support representative. That’s the true, expensive cost and risk of users not following the developers’ advice and roadmap. I think everyone who is testing Lightning on mainnet is doing it with the best intentions, but let’s not let external politics and the desire to prove ourselves right get in the way of sound engineering, protocol progress, and user safety.
Just my two cents."
That's from Jack, a developer of Zap. Do it at your own risk :D

Use electrum. Setup a segwit wallet but use a BIP39 Mnemonic seed. You will be able to receive from segwit addresses and legacy addresses. I recommend this [tool](
Edit: Here's a video I discovered a while ago. He does a step by step tutorial showing how to set it up.

It runs on a light version of the blockchain called [neutrino]( It's only around 500 mb I think.

I believe he temporarily removed it due to funds not showing up. Once the wallet has fully synced and open, you can view your deposit address.

Terrible idea.
* 1# Highly illegal

Hello, I'm not sure if you have the issue resolved. If you're using it for eCommerce you may as well use woocommerce for Wordpress. A developer has made a lightning charge payment gateway plugin for woocommerce. Might help you out. :)

Hey all, thanks for tagging me It seems like the issue has been resolved for me now, although I used mobile as an alternative when it happened. I did send blockchain an email and just got an email back about resetting 2FA when that wasn't the issue. I don't think they were aware this error was happening. I hope everyone has it resolved now, if not drop them an email. ;)  
@_date: 2017-12-16 22:35:47
What device did you use? Do you remember your seed?
@_date: 2017-12-30 00:26:09
No, although the wallet.dat maybe encrypted with a password. If you don't know it, it's possible to bruteforce it. But that's a whole different story. I wouldn't worry about that until you find the wallet.dat.

I'm not sure, it depends if you used a web wallet like blockchain or a software wallet like electrum. You could try what this guy said 


Go to blockchain.info and look for the wallet login and say you forgot your wallet identifier. You should be able to send your email address a confirmation of your identifier and then you can log in. This assumes you utilized blockchain.info
@_date: 2017-12-23 02:39:25
No it's not compatible. But there's a [tutorial]( which a user linked where you can use a segwit address and receive/send to legacy addresses, although sending to legacy addresses = high fees. Check out the tutorial though. Pretty useful. :)

You also might have emails if he ever donated to you also. This guy is an idiot targeting you with malware if you know him. Specially to steal money. I have followed you on Twitch and will tune in when you go live next. I'm sorry for your loss but I hope you will learn from this in the future.

[Original post](


We were lucky enough to not pay sooo much for the first three tries since our insurance covered it. But every new try is 100% on us! They won´t pay anymore.
We tried to save for it since around two years. Two years ago I also invested a bit in Bitcoin. Sold and rebought in bubbles and made a bit of money.
Which now allows us to pay for the next two or three tries!
I will never forget when the third try failed and my wife cried in my arms about wanting to be mom. That was the most depressing thing I ever witnessed!
But now we got at least a chance to try again!
THANK YOU! And good luck everyone and stay positive!
If it works, it will literally be a Bitcoin baby.

Search for a wallet.dat on the computer. Search the whole drive for it. Check txt files for in case he saved his seed or any other storing information.

Check browser history logs. If you want to take a deeper dive at searching deleted files use [Recuva](

Just the address is useless. No wallet identifier or anything?

Why pay that when you buy directly from [Ledger]( for half the price?

[Okay buddy.](

That sucks. Can't even load the site anyway. So slow.

Here we go again...

Idk if this post is a Roger Ver shit post or promoting his bcash shill. Either way 53 upvotes and 3 comments in 2 hours is impressive, sounds too fishy to be true, hmmm.

Names of nodes are optional. Anyone can set an alias if they run a node. People can have the same alias if they wanted to. The alias doesn't define the nodes identity. The node public key does.

It could be a Twitter employee or the original owner who had it since 2009. No clue. I'm pretty sure Twitter doesn't recycle username handles like that.
@_date: 2018-04-08 14:55:41
I thought you couldn't claim banned handles?
@_date: 2018-04-08 15:04:56
Nope it's

Whoever owns it put "Gafur?" in the bio and then deleted it. Not sure what it means. 
@_date: 2018-04-08 17:41:18
Account suspended for me. 
@_date: 2018-04-08 16:57:12
Yes I see that lmao. I'm just wondering how Twitter allowed this to happen. Either the original owner has it or a Twitter staff member.
@_date: 2018-04-08 21:29:10
And now the profile picture. What's happening lmao?
@_date: 2018-04-08 21:05:42
Update: Seems like the account has been reestablished. I'm confused on who owns it now.  
@_date: 2018-04-08 21:02:04
Twitter doesn't recycle usernames when the previous account got terminated. Well not after a few hours anyway. I'm not sure how this guy got his hands on it in the first place. 
@_date: 2018-04-08 16:37:43
Why would Twitter just recycle the name like that after only a few hours?


@_date: 2018-04-08 17:43:04
Yes. It's been terminated again after a Turkish person had the account. (Some how)
