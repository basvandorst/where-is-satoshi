The Chinese crackdown is forcing Chinese boiler rooms to liquidate positions and get back into fiat before the great firewall makes their plays inaccessible.
That hot money is liquidating, hence why all the alts are tanking and btc with them, as they need to get back to fiat asap.
Read up on Justin Sun, founder of the Tron coin.  He has 300M, made off the Tron pump and dump, that he needs to get back to USD and yuan before the great firewall cuts him off.

The reason is political and not technical. You’re presenting and argument for shitcash. And if the the btc whales ameliorate to block size increases, they tacitly say that shitcash is the better coin, so they lose money and prestige and ppl shift to shitcoin.

You can only decentralize exchanges if bitcoin has an exchange value of use.  Exchanges are there to provide a liqudity event so people can get into fiat, and then use fiat for its exchange value to goods &amp; services.
This is why Charlie Lee, founder of litecoin, sold all his coins for USD.  USD and its exchange value can buy you a house, cars, groceries, etc.
Bitcoin mempool keeps growing, so people can't transact, which is counter to the behaviour of a currency..
Solve the network problem while maintainng proof of work, then you have a comparable offering to fiat.  BTC may have to wait until quantum computers are computationally powerful enough for a fully distributed ledger.
There are other software/hardware designs the protocol can implement for surge cases, but there are no BIPS that I've have read that are reasonable without sacrificing security.

did you read the article?  It argues that if there's an external audit by the community then it strengthens the claim that tether is not a scam. Ditto for an external audit of exchange USD reserves. So right now, the community is proceeding at risk, which is fine.  But newbs should know the risk out there, and set the  proper alerts and watch dogs.
Once the risks are removed btc can proceed on a firmer foundation.

Note: a lot of the price movement in btc and eth are from people entering the crypto funnel and using those coins to exchange
For other alt coins.
When coinbase introduces ripple for trading, ppl
Won’t need btc or eth as intermidiary coins,

proof of work by definition is a computational intensive effort.  Unless there's a protocol rule to dynamically tune the sha256 hashing to fewer zeros when network congestion is signalled, and a consensus among the nodes for the reduced hashing 0, scaling will always be an issue.
That's why ethereum wants to move to proof of stake, which is in my opinion, solves network problems but opens security holes.  That's the engineering trade off with existing hardware: security or scalability.

**Crypto Currency Liquidity Crisis Explained:**
Coinbase and other exchanges fragmented bitcoins into millions of small uotxs [1], likely to increase fee charges, by sending small crumbs to fulfill a TX.  However, now that mempool is full it costs exchanges more to aggregate the small uotxs crumbs to fulfill your TXs then the cost of creating the crumbs.
Therefore, exchanges will try to delay TXs, until the transaction fees go down, unless they lose out money on every TXs.
As the mempool continues to be congested more fragmented txs become dangling crumbs (costing exchanges more to fulfill then the cost of creating the fragmentation).
This is causing a liquidity crisis as
More reserves (Euros and USD) on exchanges are diverted to meet existing tx obligations.  A workaround is to delay txs in the hopes the mempool clears, and transaction fees lower, but as the mempool continues to congest, **the liquidity crisis is becoming a solvency crisis for all exchanges**, since every transaction is costing them more than creating the fragmented crumbs.
**This is a design flaw in the market structure of exchanges**, and the current bitcoin protocol.
It can happen again in the future.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:33:39

correct, but there's been delays on ppl getting BCH-&gt;USD in their USD wallets.
The volumes need to be high enough for the liquidity trap to start.  It's more likely to happen when BCH-&gt;BTC occurs in January 2018.  The volumes may be sufficient then.  If so and there's no liqudity issue, then the theory is proven wrong.

Here's the ELI5 version.
A block chain is a distributed ledger.  A block chain is made up of a list of blocks.  Each block has a hash derived from its set of transactions and a link to the previous block and what's known as a nonce.  This hash must comprise of a value that has a predefined number of zeros in sha256.  ie 0000000fe23ead3...
Mining is solving the math to get a hash.  If solution doesn't get the correct leading 0s, the algo increases the nonce by 1, and the math is recalculated. repeat this process until you get the correct number of leading 0s.  Once the hash has the correct number of leading 0s, that block can be added to the block chain.
The only way to solve sha256 hashes is brute force, unless you can proof otherwise.  If you did, you'd probably win a turing medal.  
As more "coins", but in reality blocks are hash-validated, the algo increases the number of leading 0s to the hash, making it computationally more difficult to solve.
All this is known as proof of work.  The point of it is that it prevents a nefarious actor from changing the block chain.  Since the block chain is linked, if the actor made any chains to a block in the block chain, the actor would have to computationally recompute the all blocks in the block chain AND do so before a new block is added to the block chain.
Computationally, this could be done, but at this point, you'd have to invest billions in hardware to do so, so it would be uneconomical for the bad actor.

It’s the cost of getting your transaction on the different block chains. It’s cheaper to get on the ripple block chain. The btc blockchain has a high transaction fee because of something called the mempool, clearing older transactions, that have  transactions where ppl hav  offered higher sat/byte to be put on the newer block first.

None of the exchanges have enough fiat to back all the claims, if a run to fiat occurs.
I've read a uncredible rumor on this subreddit that exchange employees are front running customers to cash out themselves, friends and family.
Given what has happen with the bitcoin.com guy and the coinbase news, it seems big holders are front running back into fiat, even exchanging to other alt coins as an intermediary channel.

the whole point of bitcoin was to decentralize. see Satoshi's original white paper. The problem is that bitcoin never became a currency with exchange value, and now with the mempool growing unwieldly, it'll be some time yet, if ever, when transaction fees are low for it to be. 
Also, BCH is controlled by a group who will fork it as soon as they can make money off a new hard fork.  They want the $$$ not a paradigm shift away from centralized fiat.  A hard fork is equivalent to a central authority increasing the money supply.

true, but the funds have to be in your USD wallet for it to be insurable according to their website:
"If you are a United States resident, your Coinbase USD Wallet is covered by FDIC insurance, up to a maximum of $250,000."
So, if funds aren't in the USD wallet, they aren't insurable?  I'm not a lawyer, but that's my interpretation. You'd have to get your coins into the USD wallet to be FDIC insured.  And if bad news came out and there was a run on coinbase, it'd be very hard to convert into the USD wallet.

In thin markets, this is how you pump.
you give money to your friend to buy you shares and help pump.  Let's say it's 100 dollars.  And the average volume/unit time for the stock is very low. like 10 units.  
You have 100 shares. And you have 100 dollars to pump.
total: 100 shares + 100 dollars  + 100 given to friend = 300 // Initial Condition
S0:  Your friend buys 10 units at 1.01
S1:  You buy 10 units at 1.02
S2:  Your friend buys 10 units at 1.03
S3: You buy 10 units at 1.04
S4: Your friend buys 10 shares at 1.05
At the end of this pump:
total: 100 shares + 20 shares from your purchase + 30 shares from your purchase + 80 (remainder of your pump fund) + 70 (remainder of your friend's pump fund).
= 150 * 1.05 per share + 150
= 307.5 // 7.5 dollars in paper gains.
Bagholder (HODLER) comes along and buys 150 @ 1.05.  You tell your friend to exit with you.  You've gained  2.5% ROI on this pump.  The ROI can be greater than 100% if your pump fund is deep and there's a huge demand for a technology that will revolutionize finance and free the people from bankers.
But let's assume that Mt.Gox was hacked and not all the coins were stolen.  You only claim all of them were gone.  But you have the private keys to 50K coins.  You distribute the coins among your friends.  They can now pump those coins to bubble evaluations.  This is alledgely what some ppl believe Roger Vers has done.

But the property of a currency is that it's exchange agnostic.  It doesn't distinguish between junk and real.
The exchange of value to a homeless person (donation) and someone buying house are equivalent.

The central fallacy people make about crypto is that they are a currency. They are securities masking as currencies.  A side effect of this is that purchases in the 0.000001 of a coin can drive prices up in the tens of thousands.  That’s the assymwtrical allure of a coin security.

**Why the next big crash will occur in Jan. 2018, When Coinbase allows BCash to be sold**
First, it's important to understand the market structure.
We have exchanges like Coinbase that likely fragment coins into millions of utxos. Furthemore, we have a mempool that can be congested with low sat/byte.
Scenario 1: BCash gets dump for Cash by the majority of coin owners.
Outcome: BCash goes to 0 quickly. Normal market operations.
Scenario 2: BCash gets converted to BTC.  Markets become illiquid.
Outcome: Coinbase needs to buy BTC from other exchanges. It does so, but it also has to fragment the coins into millions of utxo. This fragmentation causes mempool congestion. Transaction fees spike. Exchanges becomes illiquid.
At this point, a dark pool can be set up, so exchanges can trade coins directly to one another with an IOU, once mempool congestion subsides, But all exchanges are quickly short on coin, so it's not viable.
The other path is for prices to perceptibly drop so ppl sell coins, putting it into the system, for cash.
The consequence of this is that exchanges have to recombine the millions of utxo to fulfill the BTC-&gt; cash transaction, which can cost more than fragmenting, and puts more strain on the mempool, making the system more illiquid. Thus exchanges can become insolvent, as funds are drained to recombine utxos, if they weren't allowed to delay fiat transfers.
Here's the point. The recent crash occured when BCash was allowed to trade for a few hours. When Coinbase allows BCash to be sold again, that's millions of coins that can be dumped, and converted into BTC, hence millions of BTC that need to be in the system. Which implies that it'll be **an order of magnitude worse** then what has happened these last few days.
They'll likely have to suspend trades after a few hours again.
There is no quick fix because this is a design flaw in the market structure. ie, if exchanges do fragment into millions of utxos. Every introduction of a new coin on a big exchange risks this systemic outcome.
The only fix is to never allow BCash to be traded. **It must become a stranded asset.**
**Note**: Ppl pulling coins into hardware wallets will exasterbate this systemic risk. However, exchanges mediate this by delaying the wallet to wallet transfer.
**Note2**:  Ironically, another fix is to have a central reserve of bitcoins held by a central authority to inject into the system when it becomes illiquid, much like a Central Bank.

@_date: 2017-12-19 14:37:49
Be careful when holding your coins on ANY exchanges.  It seems that there's a trend for exchanges to be "hacked", and lose all the coins.
Whether the hacks were helped from the inside is a topic of discussion, since the market is unregulated, and its a hacking crime where no one will be prosecuted. So the payoff is huge to let hackers in, and divide the coins among the counter parties.

The first paragraph says:
"All digital currency that Coinbase holds online **is fully insured**. This means that if Coinbase were to suffer a breach of its online storage, the insurance policy would pay out to cover any customer funds lost as a result. Digital currency is not legal tender, is not backed by the government, and digital currency accounts and value balances on Coinbase are not subject to Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or Securities Investor Protection Corporation protections."
It says it's fully insured, but **not FDIC insured**.  There's a huge difference.

But given all the news around transaction cost, it shows a fundamental design flaw in the current version of bitcoin.  It can't be a currency because no one wants to pay 40 USD to transact.
It also kind of shows that mem pool can be spammed, if there enough low sat/byte TX.  You just send a flood of very low sat/byte request, like a DDOS attack using pings.
