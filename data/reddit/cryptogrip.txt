This is why solutions like Airswap (AST) are going up so quickly in price...and why I'm seriously considering going in heavy on an AST investment. AST offers the potential of a decentralized exchange and with the issues we're seeing these days, such an exchange could create enormous value.

Why don't you actually research rather than regurgitate bullshit?
- It's down to 70% from 80%. China may have up to 70%, but it is a non-issue. That's just because of cheaper electricity. Bitcoin mining is not a China resource, and mining operations have very little overhead involved with relocating to wherever they can get the best price on electricity and operation costs. This has been analysed to death, and the conclusion is that mining in China is a NON issue.
- Proof of work IS most definitely the most secure, and the very reason that we are willing to sacrifice speed and fees for security. Speed and fees will improve with advancements in the tech, but security is a must. There was detailed study done on how much more secure Bitcoin is than the others, and it was very eye-opening. Security and 10 years of up time without hacking is why Bitcoin is thriving.
- Energy efficiency is only an issue if you read the click bait. Do you not realize this is attempts to lead naive people to think this way? It's common knowledge that going green is the new thing, and what better way to attack bitcoin? Bitcoin is actually exceptionally efficient as it eliminates the vast expense of all middlemen and still provides security that makes all other currencies and payment systems pale in comparison. Many intelligent people believe that Bitcoin may actually lead the movement to more efficient energy production. Things change. Remember when dial up was slow and when a lot of people voiced the concern that the internet was a waste of electricity and that there was no way in hell email would catch on??

You not only seem to believe the FUD you read, but you are also reading dated FUD. Try harder please.

@_date: 2019-07-27 14:31:48
You just want it to keep going up and never drop hey? We started the year in the 3k range so you need to be realistic. Perhaps you're looking for some magical investment that nobody ever sells when they make profits but you won't find it. As for regulations, they are needed to clean uo the space, and change from country to country so no - they will not weed out bitcoin. Haha, that's funny though.
@_date: 2019-07-28 14:15:45
In other words, good time to buy! Just kidding, any time is a good time to buy bitcoin if you DCA.
@_date: 2019-07-17 23:52:46
Here's another one: you're clueless. Have fun with that the value in that one too!
@_date: 2019-07-02 21:05:15
No, that doesn't work. Use your own experience of buying in only a few months at the top as an example. DCA, both up and down because nobody knows when it stops in either direction.
Also, it's far from just whales and this whole whale conspiracy has to stop. I've been listening to it for years and it's from people who just don't know any better. It's also limit orders, stop losses, trading bots, thousands of traders, retail FOMO, institutional preparation, and today for example...the recent news of Ameritrade physically settled contracts is big news and confirms even further that Bitcoin is headed for a HUGE future.
@_date: 2019-07-31 15:23:38
You can't stop an open source peer to peer technology that's been growing in infrastructure and adoption for 10 years. I mean certain groups can try sure. But we all know that unless there's a catastrophic failure in the tech, why would the growth just suddenly stop? It just escalates as more and more platforms, onramps, and developments materialize. Sit back and watch the show (and invest for the long term if you want to make some money off of it).
@_date: 2019-07-09 18:13:27
Typically the price of a bitcoin increases up to the halving and after the last halving the price increased even faster. As we all know it peaked in Dec 2017. From July 2016 to 2017, within a year following bitcoin's block reward halving, the bitcoin price spiked by nearly 10X from $268 to $2,525. Then went on to skyrocket to almost 20k in the next 6 months.
Consider that back then, Bitcoin was way harder and more complicated to purchase for newcomers, and institutions like Fidelity, Ameritrade, bakkt, etc., weren't even in the picture. That should give you some persepctive of where this is all headed. Anyone with patience enough to see past the noise and day to day price can be highly rewarded by investing long term, and certainly by cost averaging in.

Your call of course. But if you do decide to invest it in bitcoin ...or the stock market for that matter, it's worth considering cost averaging. Buy in smaller amounts on regular increments. You just missed a nice price dip but nobody knows how many others we'll get.

@_date: 2019-07-02 13:52:26
The only thing that makes sense is to buy a little via cost averaging because absolutely nobody could know if we'll ever drop to 8k again, or when that would happen if we did. This current price is a retrace after last Wednesday's pump with the "too much, too fast" price action. There's no reason why it would drop to 8k when so many people are accumulating before next year's halving, and with all the new on-ramps popping up making bitcoin purchases easier than ever, bakkt coming online, etc. Anyway, nobody can answer that question because opinions on this sub are rarely accurate, and are only guesses, including mine.

Meh, there's whales in every market. I just don't foolishly attribute every price move to a whale conspiracy, because, well because I'm an adult with a brain. People buy and sell, it's literally a social network of investors and trading. A large number of participants and automated services can make a large number of trades in a very short time to make people (like you) quickly assume it's a big fat whale.
@_date: 2019-07-24 16:48:01
Absolutely. The market price, as you may know, is rarely a reflection of development and advancement. Just like a lot of the technology that we use today, most people knew very kittle little about it until it was a regular part of their lives. The publicity bitcoin received last week is a sign of its 10 year resilience.

Bitcoin has outperformed all stocks by multiple factors. Nothing comes close. Let's just take the past 5 years and say you put 100 bucks a week into bitcoin and the same into your stocks. No contest. You bought bitcoin during the highest few months in the asset's existence and calling it a bad investment is not a fair assesment. If you'd had gone all in on stocks just before the 2008 crash youd be the same predicament, but that does not make stocks a bad investment. I was fine in 2008 because I also cost averaged my stock portfolio and hedged with other investments. You need to be fair when assessing investments.
@_date: 2019-07-01 19:02:14
Oh you mean if they bought all at once, sure, but investing by going all in at once is rarely a good idea. If they have been cost averaging then they'd be fine because bitcoin has only ever been higher than it is now for 30 days out of 10 years.
@_date: 2019-07-23 19:38:31

You bought the top of the mountain, got pissed off and didn't buy since. Had you bought any of the countless times when the price was down to 3200, 4k, 5k, 6k, etc you'd be in the green now, and happy. That's how you invest,  nobody buys the top of a ten year chart in one buy and then calls it a bad it investment. You make many buys over the years and lower your average buy in. 
Anyway who knows, maybe your recent guess at 8k will happen and you'll get the chance!

I suppose if you're selling. Holding / accumulating bitcoin is not affected until a later time when and if you sell for USD. If you look deeper into this, the IRS said they are trying to educate people. So once again this is positive news because it implies that they expect growth in bitcoin investment and trading, but the media has spun it into FUD for clicks and ad revenue.
@_date: 2019-07-05 04:25:55
Anyone who cost averaged any one year of bitcoin's 10 ...ANY 1 single year, would be up right now. And a year is pretty small. If you cant at least go a year than you can hardly call it investing. But you clearly take this whole thing very negatively so I'm not sure logic is going to mean much to you.
@_date: 2019-07-28 14:26:50

@_date: 2019-07-27 15:06:19

Well there's also the hedge, and an alternative way to store wealth to traditional investments and of course to gold, that aligns with total ownership, security, easy transfer and easy liquidity. But I suppose we could go on all day right? 
Trying to go up against mainstream currencies like USD is a long road ahead, but establishing itself as mass adopted value store will face very little resistence, with the exception of old school thinking and gold huggers. Governments won't be blocking the value store digital gold use, but they will resist the dethroning of their country's currency to the bitter end. Embrace the digital gold use case. That's where the near term potential sits. The rest will come later as ramps between bitcoin and other currencies are built.

You never bought this dip, that's on you. DCA has made everyone money for years in Bitcoin. Simple math. Price has only been above 10k for 30 days in 10 years. 
If you have been cost averaging there are only 30 days in a decade that you would have paid more than the price is right now. Think about that, not about douche bags trying to get you to sell because they are morons.

No problem, just everytime there's price movement there's somebody who thinks it's whales.

It's not always a whale conspiracy.
@_date: 2019-07-17 21:45:05
There's so much wrong with your post, I don't know where to begin. First off, Bitcoin is a protocol, and it works really, really just exceptionally well. In fact, this past decade has established bitcoin as a base layer that is worth building on top of for many years to come.
No, just NO, to it being a novelty because it's first. Once you learn more, you would be embarrassed to repeat that in public. It's way past the novelty stage, way past the fad stage. The protocol will likely be developed way into the years past our lifetimes. Remember TCP? That protocol that was shitty and could never be efficient enough? Well, it now runs the entire internet because it was developed and its base layer was worth building on. Also, NO,  bitcoin wallets have not been hacked. They've been stolen the same way someone steals you email or bank account... they trick you into giving up your credentials (keys in this case).
Please take the time to understand the basics, and don't just take what you read here at face value...including what I say. DYOR!!

@_date: 2019-07-30 15:07:56
I agree with this, but I'd suggest buying a little here and there the way we invest in anything as opposed to buying just once. That way you catch more price points. Bitcoin as a technology and protocol has been evolving for years and now with more and more infrastructure and on ramps popping up it's just a matter of letting the network effect grow. Live our lives and no obsession necessary!

@_date: 2019-07-14 12:27:11
Correct. Remember, if you don't sell and wait it out, these drops turn into nothing but lower prices in your rear view mirror. Besides, if it didn't move this way, it wouldn't be the opportunity that it is. High reward usually comes at the price of high risk. You've Hodl'd through worse.

?? Wha? It's not a flaw. Of course I have no interest in selling something I believe will be worth more in the near term. Bitcoin saturation is minuscule. Until more people adopt it as a value store, it has potential to continue rising in price. That's why I'm saying that by the time it's used as currency on any mainstream level, you and I will be dead.
But listen man, who cares what I think right? With all the bizzaro comments on the daily sub, I mean some totally whacked out comments, why have you chosen to criticize lil ol me?

Yes, pull backs are healthy and necessary for the market to grow. My point is simply that so far this year, most all pull backs have not been nearly as low as what the TA crowd have been calling for. They've been calling a drop from 12k down to 8k, but 9k-10k may be more likely what we'll see. We may even have already bottomed at 9800. Who knows.

That was said at 5k, 6k, 7k, etc.... it was only right at 12/13k and that was understandable. Many sold at 9k and it just kept going up. You can never know with bitcoin  and thinking you know and then selling is a good way to lose money.

Whoa, reign it in a little there. The system going down talk is a discussion that may or may not happen one day, but for now let's just be glad that Bitcoin is being taken seriously enough to be considered a legit alternative as a value store and currency. We've been years getting to this point, and infrastructure currently in place for the existing system was built over a very long time, and it will take a long time to "bring it down" as well. Stay rational and avoid representing Bitcoin supporters as fanatics. It'll all fall in place, but it's not gonna bring the system down any time soon.
@_date: 2019-07-16 17:41:26
I see Bitcoin as incredibly useful and it's security of mining more than makes up for its cost many times over. We're simply at the beginning stages of where this is all going and the Bitcoin base layer can be built upon for years to come. Because of that, I'm throwing money at it hoping it will throw more back at me as it already has over the years. 
I see the marijuana industry it's an incredibly useful service as marijuana becomes legalized across the globe. Because of that I throw money at it and it throws more back at me.

I'm not much into alts but selling low is flat out stupid. You lose nothing until you sell. So FFS if you must sell any of this stuff, sell when it's at least no lower than what you bought for. It's been going up and down for a long time and will very likely continue to do so.

@_date: 2019-07-19 12:24:46
It's a long road ahead. Bitcoin is the first of its kind, so trying to evaluate it's success as a currency without an open mind is very premature. Past examples of deflationary currencies that were not on a distributed ledger with peer to peer networking are not comparable. There will most likely be countless layers added to the bitcoin protocol that can address issues as we move forward. All we can do is speculate, so my point is just to keep an open mind. We have never advanced in the past by looking at problems without considering there are solutions that we just haven't come up with yet.

What kind of an idiot would buy all the bitcoin he plans to buy in one purchase... at the ath?!
You wouldn't do that stupid shit in the stock market either. Reality is, if you bought bitcoin in regular buys, the vast majority of your purchases would be below the current price, and only a very small number of purchases woukd have been above 10k. So you'd be weĺl in the green.

Ha ha, none of that makes bitcoin a bad investment. You're sounding ridiculous now. This hate you have on for bitcoin isn't healthy, and it certainly is not going to improve your finances. You can hate it, criticize it, waste your time bashing it in Reddit all you want, but Bitcoin's going to do what it's gonna do right? I invest my time into things I actively invest money into. I meet with investors and we discuss stocks, I also meet with bitcoin investors, some who used to mine, and we discuss crypto. That's because I still buy crypto.  
You say you don't buy bitcoin anymore, so why in the hell are you wasting so much time in this sub, just to try and piss off people with you're over the top obvious bitcoin hate posts? LOL, I'm not going to get upset and name call you, because I know nothing you or anyone can say changes the fact that bitcoin is an amazing investment, and one of the more exciting investments out there with it's ups and downs to keep it interesting. But there are many on here who will just insult you and call you out for over-posting the same negativity time and time again. Once was enough to just complain about your own loss.

A lot of the retail interest in Bitcoin on discussion forums like this sub is from a young generation of investors.

Naw, that's what you said "alt coins have failed". Clearly you are throwing them all in to the same basket and you equate the low cost of alts to them failing. The alts that matter are still around and very relevant. The ones that died were just a playground for speculation and birthed from ICO greed. They need to go. Now, if you believe that alts that just came into existence a few years ago should already be implemented into models for supply chain and intelligence platforms then you have no clue about how long this takes, and no business criticizing it. You sound like a grumpy old man with nothing but shit talk. Of course there's pros and cons but you do nothing but spew toxic hate all day long.

? Actually it's becoming increasingly easier to buy bitcoin for the "average" person. Cash App now allows quick shift in and out of fiat, Shakepay in Canada allows you to install the app, verify with your phone no and buy bitcoin with an etransfer all in 5 minutes, and Coinbase now lets you cash out via PayPal. Get with the times man!! You said average person. Perhaps if I wanna buy a few hundred million dollars worth of crypto it's harder... I wouldn't know.

Remember on this sub when people were stressing over buying one bitcoin a month and it dropped like 30% down from $350? The EXACT same shit was said in the EXACT same conversations. Just like it was 5 or 6 months ago about $3200, and now we're trippled in price. There must be 3 kinds of people: noobs, those with a horrible memory, and douchebags.

Look there's no reason to make it so complicated. There's a very fine line between store value and currency. Both need to have enough valuue that somebody else would want it. Otherwise a store of value would be useless if you can't exchange it for the value. Because you can exchange it for the value, that makes it functional as a currency. The more people that hold Bitcoin or any other stored value for that matter, then it would reason that more people are considering it valuable. It's been this way for a very long time, whether it be shells, gold, fish, pelts, etc. The fixed supply simply aligns bitcoin with modern times, with a digital society, where the network can maintain and account for itself via the accuracy of math and computer processing. You need to realize that along with the characteristics of currency we now have a blend with a newly introduced concept. People can say, oh deflationary currencies don't work, but they are forgetting that past deflationary currency models were not the same as a global decentralized blockchain. 
The truth is, we will not know if bitcoin can work as a currency for sure till we try. That's the one thing that even many of the most brilliant minds out there agree on. And you and I will be dead by the time there is an answer. So arguing about it is pointless.
@_date: 2019-07-02 03:30:56
Like I said, it's all perspective. If you'd loaded up on stocks in 2008, it'd be the same story. It has nothing to do with bitcoin. This thing is out of control. Had you told me 5 years ago we'd be sitting on a 10k BTC I'd have thought you were high lol. Now that I see the billions spent on this thing, with the exchanges, startups, apps, Investment fund, bakkt, the security, the rapidly growing demand for the fixed supply... my years of working in tech tells me hands down this is a paragon for the technology adoption curve. Hell, you could basically use bitcoin to define technical adoption, because it fits every detail of what a tech adoption curve is. We don't need to worry about bitcoin my friend. In fact we should be more worried about what bitcoin is going to do to us, because rarely has anything in history that can maintain itself via its own network ever evolved this quickly. The funny thing is, we're among the tiny minority that are aware in these first decades. Most people won't even see it coming.

Wow, you have quite the crossover between arrogance, complacency and naivety happening. 10 years is a blink. 100 years is a blink. Consider:
- 21 million coins, each divisible by 100 million, is more than enough. If you crack the shell on that closed mind of yours, you'll look past the current state of things, to understand that a new type of economic exchange can evolve. 
- In almost every case of our advancement and evolution, particularly where technology is involved, the solutions that we create were not even previously thought of. Bitcoin will almost certainly evolve in this way. 
- You can't wrap your head around bitcoin as a mainstream currency because you can't envision the way it will play out with layers, sidechains and muliple other advancements.
- Bitcoin is the paragon of the technology curve of adoption and evolution. It's self-maintained and is growing at a pace that exceeds all expectations (nobody in the tech field thought it would be where it is today 10 years ago).
- Mainstream currency use will probably not happen until far more people own bitcoin, and it has established the role of value store first and volatility has settled down significantly.
- Backed by processing power, data, and energy, (the things that are becomming more and more valued in this digital age) highly secure and rare, it has the potential to be the perfect currency of next generations. Money, as streaming content. 
- Eliminating the middle man and thousands of moving parts, costs and points of failure, bitcoins self-maintaining ecosystem/network is incredibly efficient. In the end efficiency wins in the technical society.
I hope this at least makes you think a little more openly, although you seem like an extra stubborn one. Who knows, perhaps you'll live to see it happen!

That's how those pumps work. It isn't just a few whales, it's also limit orders, sell walls, bots, and a large number of small traders waiting for the moment to take profit. The only people that should be buying or selling during those pumps are traders, and even then it's no easy task to time this market. Unfortunately, those pumps are the bait that drag people in to buy because of FOMO. Cost averaging is the only way to stay in the green in my opinion.
@_date: 2019-07-17 15:00:11
This is early. Very very early. What you're saying has been said over and over since bitcoin was sub $100. How long before people learn that the same forces that brought bitcoin from pennies to10k don't just stop at 3-5% saturation. If nothing changes for the worse, and development continues, why would the growth all of a sudden just halt for no reason? 
It's only getting some real weight behind it now and finally beginning to be taken seriously.
@_date: 2019-07-04 15:10:24
It's a personal preference. Anyone that went all in at 15-20k in 2017 wish they'd have cost averaged. Anyone that went all in 5 months ago at 3-4k are very thankful they did.
Nothing goes straight up,  so cost averaging allows you catch multiple price points, and normally works best. I have always cost averaged.
All that being said, this year is not typical, because bitcoin is up over 300%, and considering that so many people are accumulating for an anticipated higher price due to next year's halving and a flood of optimism in main stream media,  this price growth could very well continue for a long time. There's also a a strong likelyhood of institutional buying for preparation for soon to launch platforms from the likes of bakkt and Ameritrade and probably many more to follow. 
Bottom line, it's anyone's guess, but if you're in it for the long haul, and not hoping for instant returns, either strategy should work.
@_date: 2019-07-16 20:23:58
Still feel that way. It's not a prediction.  Let's be honest here, be a man and own up to what your beef here really is. People are in this sub every day, not just predicting price, but EXACT prices, even how they will move from day to day. And you're calling me out for saying institutional money is coming, or statements I made a year ago???
Seriously come on spit it out, what's really your beef with me? Because if you're going to criticize price predictions you have your work cut out for you on this sub lol.

When you grow up, and you see this tech, along with a multitude of other innovative technologies that were only introduced within the last 10 years or so become a part of your every day, you'll think about these conversations and realize that YES, it does take that long for technologies to mature. If there wasn't extreme volatility in these early years, now that would be a mystery.
Anyway, my work, personal interests, close friends into the early mining, etc., are why I like the space. But you seem to think it's toxic and you post nothing but negativity... so why exactly are you in this sub if this stuff makes you so miserable?

Sfxnyc, you're starting to get kinda weird with these posts man. You only come out to say these things when the price dips, but when it rises you slink away. You must realize this doesn't make you right...don't you?? The price is always going up and down, it's bitcoin!!
If you were really that smart you should be buying these dips so that you can stop feeling so dumb about buying the highest few months in Bitcoin's history and making horrible past investment decisions. You could literally have bought your way out of that hole this last year! But Instead you just come on here pretending to know more than others, and that's not going to benefit you in any way.

@_date: 2019-07-28 14:34:07
There are several ways. The challenge here is that the person you are sending it to is not familiar with sending and receiving BTC, so simply sending it to an already established wallet address (the most practical way to send BTC) is not an option. Honestly, I think the best gift you can give them is a little overview/training after you send them the bitcoin via either a paper wallet, bitcoin gift card, or hardware wallet. Personally, I'd buy them a HW wallet like a Ledger or Trezor and send it to them with a little bitcoin already stored. Then you can proceed to teach them how to use it, and potentially set them on a new interest and way of storing wealth for the future. Potentially, you could change their life.
@_date: 2019-07-13 17:28:19

Yeah well most importantly just don't buy during that time. In the long term, week to week is not relevant unless you're trading, watching price all the time, trying to time this stiff. I personally prefer to avoid that mess and simply include Bitcoin as one if my invetments and cost average. It's worked very very well.

No clue really. People are calling out prices all day long. Some crazy high some crazy low. It's a guess. All I know is that bitcoin has been increasing in price for years, with crazy short lived spikes along the way. Any price prediction for a specific time though?.. that's just having fun for most people I assume, cause nobody can possibly predict points along this crazy ride man. It goes down I get it cheaper, it goes up my coin ia worth more. Win win, and I'm here for the long haul.
@_date: 2019-07-01 15:09:52
10k came much sooner than expected, since most were speculating that we'd break 10k by end of year. We're still way up from just months ago, and if you're accumulating for what's coming, this is good. It's only bad for traders who bought higher and were hoping to offload for a profit, and traders rarely make money anyway. Even the sesoned ones I know lose as much as they make.
@_date: 2019-07-02 23:48:01
Anyone that followed this advice would have literally had to buy back higher most times they tried since the beginning of this year. So if you're only talking about last Wednesday's crazy pump, that's not enough time to advise people to sell an asset increasing in price. 
Then there's the fact that next year's halving will see far more people accumulatimg this year. Then there's the fact that DCA up and down almost always leaves you in the green given a very modest amount of time. Then there's the fact that 22% of bitcoin participants are holders. Then theres the fact that long term capital gains taxes are far more merciful than if you are trading. Oh and the fact that only about 5% of traders are successful - trying to time this market can stress the hell out of a person. That's just off the top of my head. I'm sure there's more.

Bitcoin goes up,  bitcoin goes down. But the saturation is minuscule despite whatever nonsense you read saying 19%. Any of us in this for 4-6 years have seen the big picture is up, and it's very clear that nowhere near 19% of the world owns bitcoin. No drama, no exagerarion. It's an interesting space, it's new, and it's rapidly changing. How this space looks now compared to another decade from now will most likely be nothing like any of us can clearly imagine right now. So if you think the volatility won't ever level off, that's your opinion to have but things can evolve and change a lot. I prefer to keep an open mind, and I love Bitcoin's potential for a value store like gold.
Edit: auto correct :)

5k, 15k, don't care. Same ol ups and downs for years. Bitcoin drops I get more when I buy, then laugh at the stupid mainstream media articles changing the spin on things from day to day with their horrible grammar.  Long term looks exactly the same despite short term hurdles. No amount of drama is going to change long term value growth.
@_date: 2019-07-17 10:42:20
Lmao, that is so true man. I guess the thing is, whenever bitcoin drops significantly there's usually FUD in the air. When it's climbing we think how we could have bought for much less, but when we get back to those prices the risk of a further drop is always hanging in the air and so it takes balls to pull the trigger on it. I just try to remember that it's always been that way, even at much lower prices. High risk, high reward!

What, the couple of days out of ten years that it spiked is what you're holding as the standard? If you DCA, which is what many prefer over trying to time the market, you have only paid more than today's price for a tiny fraction of your buys. Anyone that goes all in at once is putting their risk on overdrive. I wouldn't do that in the stock market either for a long term investment. Don't blame the investment for poor investing decisions. Anyone that has been cost averaging bitcoin has paid less than the current price for the majority of their buys, and are well in the green.

Ha ha, coming from you?? Dude I have not made one single price prediction in 6 years on here. I switched to this username a few years ago and you won't find a single price prediction from me. Not one. So there goes your credibility right there. Every single post you have made is incoherent and sounds like a 5 year old who thinks he has a clue.

Nobody can know what will happen. A low LTC price before the halving may be bought up and you could miss out. But there's just no way to know so ultimately you'd have bought the bitcoin dip and kept the LTC to cover off both potentials.

It's very sad that you think you have all the answers, when brilliant economists, networking professionals and developers have been debating all of this for years. The conclusion that most of the brightest minds (with the exception of that man-child Roubini) has simply been that we will have to wait and see. Yet here you post as if you know it all, and you don't even throw in the phrase "in my opinion". Instead you just ramble as if you have nothing left to learn. If that's the case, then you probably won't learn a damn thing because you're too busy preaching.
@_date: 2019-07-01 20:13:16

@_date: 2019-07-16 19:18:54
Quite the opposite my friend. Having the SEC chair publicly compare Bitcoin to gold, a sitting president talk about it, and Mnuchin say just yesterday that there is no issue with bitcoin outside of illicit use is groundbreaking. This kind of acknowledgment was unthinkable just a few years ago.
As far as regulation, did anyone with a grain of sense think that any bitcoin would not have to go through this stage?? That any government would not become defensive of any entity that threatens their native currency? 
This is all a part of the growing pains. But never  has the future looked brighter for bitcoin. Never.
@_date: 2019-07-01 11:30:29
There is actually logic in that. I mean there are a lot of people who only own one bitcoin. So 10k is not really going to change your life in any way if you lose it. But if it goes to 100k, or 1 million, that can make an impact. So yeah, holding 1 or 2 bitcoin is a no brainer.
@_date: 2019-07-05 04:57:41
You bought he worst possible 3 months, I mean the absolute worse 3 months, out of years. That has nothing to do with bitcoin. You really shouldn't post over and over about bitcoin being a bad investment based on those 3 months, if you have only held that top price since and not cost averaged to lower your average buy. I've just bought every month, little here and little there over all months over past years, and that's literally an average fair assessment - and that is way up and a very good investment. No cherry picking, no biased data, just a factual average of what return you can get by simply buying every 2 weeks or every month across the entire time frame.  Anyone starts doing that now would likely say the same a year from now, and anyone did that any year up to now can already say it was a good investment. Nothing to debate.

I agree. If you can tuck away 1 btc for what is looking more and more like a future where bitcoin is a legit, mainstream store of value, you'll be very well off.
@_date: 2019-07-16 16:05:37
If Libra eventually rolls out to mainstream use it gets people using digital currency and bottom line is bitcoin remains as the decentralized currency. Libra doesn't compete with bitcoin's store of value, it helps it and brings the use of crypto mainstream. The transition to cryptocurrencies and digital assets benefits from this.

You're completely wrong. 3D printing was a concept that if developed, could offer a solution, but it needed a lot of time to be developed. It's still massively slow and nowhere near where it will be. If you think that no solution will be developed to address volatility and fixed supply then you're the one who is delusional. Anyway, enjoy your crypto bashing, I'm off to catch a flight to what is gearing up to be a hell of a night. 
Keep bashing me, crypto, alts, exchanges whatever makes you have a happy weekend :).
@_date: 2019-07-02 03:43:55
We've been here long enough to know, the more you hear people talking about a drop coming, selling, buying lower, etc., the LESS likely that scenario is to happen. Cost average, hold, be patient and let the roots grow. This is going to be a hell of a year for bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-07-01 23:32:35
There are always whales, or deep pocket investors, market movers, whatever we choose to call them in all markets, including stocks. But they are becoming less and less of a percentage of the volume because more and more people are buying bitcoin in small amounts - largely due to ease of onboarding via platforms like cashapp and similar fiat onramps. This year has just been exceptional, I mean from 3200 to 10k is amazing. And the year is only half over with next year bringing another halving of the bitcoin miner reward, bakkt coming online,  Lightning Network soon to be going full release,  etc. 20k will be a blip compared to what's coming in my opinion.
@_date: 2019-07-19 12:45:58
People have been talking about tether for years, saying exactly what you are. And yes I can't count the times we've seen debates about whether volatility will hinder currency use, and some very smart people have been involved. There is no clear answer because we are not there yet. There are endless potential solutions not yet developed or even imagined that can be implemented into bitcoin that may address volatility. That's what makes bitcoin different from past currencies that were rigid and unable to be imrpoved. You need to keep an open mind and always remember that these issues that you worry about have been beaten to death already. It's fine to speculate and question things - that's how we advance. But don't kid yourself into thinking you alone have it all figured out.
@_date: 2019-07-05 19:45:38
Anyone salty with this year's bitcoin performance is a few lug nuts short on their wheel of thought.

The naive will be easily swayed by biased information like that, but over time I believe that second layer solutions like LN will be improved to levels of efficiency that will eliminate the bcasher's fud. Hasn't it been established that Bitcoin is most likely going to fulfill it's role as a value store first, then currency later? Bcashers are like broken records, brainwashed and proceeding to see with blinders on.

Sometimes it goes up, sometimes it goes down. What's your measuring stick? 3k? 20? 7? People want to buy and hold that's their business. To come on here and ask people to invest based on your guess is absolutely insane, and to expect that anyone would do it is even more insane. Nobody in 10 years has accurately predicted bitcoin price moves, so if you think you're the first, then you are not being realistic. 
There is only one time to buy bitcoin ... and that's when you have some cash you can afford to throw it. DCA ...every price is an entry point for a hodler.
@_date: 2019-07-18 01:38:49
Oh you mean it's 60% down from those handful of days out of 10 years? Yeah right buddy, nice word play. Guess you can twist whatever you want.
As for the coins with no use case,  there will be cleansing yes but unfortunately there will always be shitcoins to gamble on just like penny stocks. Crypto market is bigger than ever, new exchanges and platforms popping up everywhere. Open your eyes. Low prices don't kill the market. Exchanges make money in every trade, buy or sell, high price or low price. Just stop talking nonsense already, you're making shit up. Just like you said Trump is going to out Satoshi.

You can't possibly know they are not so don't pretend. Furthermore, if you're all depressed or pissed or whatever ya got going on because of this price dip,  you may be over invested. I'm telling you now, after years kicking bitcoin around, it's going back up. That's not a price prediction, just general observation. Lighten up.

@_date: 2019-07-12 18:21:31
Yeah agreed. It's also not bad for recognizing high volume to point out where the greatest accumulation occurred over the recent past, because it's usually at that point that the majority will not sell below. Other than that, meh.
@_date: 2019-07-02 03:37:37
Well if you bought high, you'll have to wait it out. Cost averaging brings down your average buy in so you start to realize gains much faster. If you aren't interested in buying more, just put it out of mind and one day down the road you'll be glad you tucked the little gem away lol. Just don't worry about drops to 5k or pumps to 15k, that's going to happen in a new market. Let the roots grow. Good luck!
@_date: 2019-07-01 16:24:42

The moment the world became connected with the internet it's been inevitable that there will be a global currency that connects along with it. It's become blatantly obvious that bitcoin is going to fill that role. What we're seeing along the way is growing pains, but the rapid growth of bitcoin is clear.

That's odd, because Bitcoin and crypto was on the list for restricted verticals. But to answer your question, no - Google does not place ads to capitalize on high volume searches. Google may end up capitalizing on the volume, because they are who you pay, but they are not the one who places the ad. Anyone who wants to advertise on Google's search results page, can open an AdWords account and place advertising where you bid on specific keywords and then you pay a cost per click, when someone clicks your ad. The cost changes depending on demand for that ad space and time in the results for searches for that keyword.  It's like an auction.
The question here is "Can advertisers now place AdWord ads for search terms related to bitcoin and Crypto?". Have the rules changed?
@_date: 2019-07-17 01:05:56
You try going 6 months without taking a shit. It's got to happen, all part of a natural cycle. No delusion just cold hard 10 year old facts. If it just kept going up non-stop? That's when you should start being being concerned.
@_date: 2019-07-02 04:40:02
There is no right time. No right time for stocks either, most people just invest a portion of their income biweekly or monthly. Bitcoin stocks whatever, it's the same concept. You only bought the top so now you may be weeks, months or years recovering. That's it nothing to do with the invesment, all to do with the investment strategy. Don't block that out, instead, learn from it. Buy tops and bottoms and you'll never fair worse off than in the middle.

@_date: 2019-07-02 13:22:53
It's nothing man.  The recent 330% increase in price of BTC doesn’t matter, but a 30% retrace is a big deal?? If there wasn't a retrace after that unsustainable pump, that's when you should be on edge. This is just bitcoin doing its thing.
@_date: 2019-07-21 19:36:54
If we can put the insults and bs aside, as constructive criticism, you can't just make your personal take on things an official definition. If the trend is up, it's a bull market. If the trend is down, it's a bear market. An ath from 2017 is not recent, and we're up 300% on the year. By definition, this is for certain a bull market.
@_date: 2019-07-15 18:25:47
It's kind of amusing that you think anyone would need to shill bitcoin in the first place. Bitcoin already has billions pumped into its spinoff infrastructure and 3rd party platforms. Any other usernames I have are off the reddit platform. Bitcoin is a very smalll portion of my investments, though it continues to bring the best return in percentages. Anyway, being pro bitcoin and recognizing a very obvious shift to bitcoin and digital assets doesn't make me a shill. Amusing though that anyone could think that for even a second.
@_date: 2019-07-01 18:35:04
Can't argue with this. 
- Holding is treating btc like an investment. So far it's proved to be a solid investment (up 300% this year alone ...last 5 years? No brainer). 
- Trading is playing the game with far bigger players, but the high risk does sometimes pay off. 
- Buying on an upward vertical? You then need to hold longer and DCA your way out of the hole.
@_date: 2019-07-18 15:54:42

\- If you are planning on holding for a few years, you just keep it in cold storage (Ledger Nano for example). 
\- If you are trading, you keep the amount you want to trade with on an exchange/ trading platform such as coinbase pro, to shift it in and out of fiat, tether, whatever, and you can use built in tools such as limit orders, stop-loss orders and much more.  
\- There's also margin trading on exchanges such as BitMex , there's the Futures market, and for the big boys there's the  Binary Options Trading with escrow services. 
\- If you are only dealing with small amounts, there's also apps like Cash App, or Shakepay in Canada, which do a fantastic job at low to no fees.
Hope that helps answer your question!

It's a bitcoin sub, the name of which is literally "discussion". You do not need to be on here calling every post an analysis lol. I've learned a lot from users on here asking and answering questions based on experience, links to development status and simply keeping an open mind. You're not going to learn shit because you think you know it all. People like you come on here bursting with emotional negativity and spite, possibly because you lost money, and then after a while you usually go away.

@_date: 2019-07-23 22:33:33
You're not wrong, but anyone investing in this for that long has been cost averaging. That means that only a small number of buys were above 10k and the large majority of buys were below 10k. Why would anyone buy everything they plan to buy in one purchase? You wouldn't do that in the stock market either would you? Also, even if they did, they've had ample opportunity to have made many purchases since 2017 to DCA their way out of the hole and well into the green by now.
@_date: 2019-07-28 21:54:49
2 years for 20k? Hell no. Even a shitty job pays more than that.
@_date: 2019-07-18 01:25:14
Fundamentals have not changed. Development is rapidly increasing. New ideas fostered by alts are, and most likey will continue to be, implemented into bitcoin process via sidechains and layering. It's been established by the direction this has taken that this will continue. 
You're concerned about alts being wiped out? Those shitcoin greed projects, developed on a whitepaper with no working model and a truckload of revenue swindled out of the hands of eager naive ICO participants? You think that's a bad thing? It's called cleansing, and it's progress. The crypto market needs diversity in digital assets to invest in yes but first we need to cull, and get rid of the coins that bring us down.
@_date: 2019-07-01 20:03:31
I kmow it's unfortunate, but you bought during the worst times but it's been up from everything you'd have bought since had you DCA'd.
Just mix it up wherever you can, stocks, etfs, crypto, real estate, etc. Diversity rules.
@_date: 2019-07-25 21:43:04
Make up all the shit you want, I said nothing of the sort. And even if I did, if you have go back to 2018 to find it, I guess you're trying pretty hard to find something to criticize me for.

Well I'm a believer in the store of value use case, the currency use case in my humble opinion is many years away. So, if there was no return, then perhaps the incredible security and self maintaining nature of bitcoin would have somehow failed. So your question is not a simple yes or no, because it's not how I personally use it.
@_date: 2019-07-04 17:18:11

@_date: 2019-07-16 21:35:30
I think you're state of mind is that you believe your own nonsense, truely believe it and that's going to keep you from learning. That's punishment enough. You sound like you're regurgitating something you probably read somewhere but don't fully comprehend, and it comes across in your words. My only suggestion to you would be to study a little into the history of currency, and go way back. Then consider that the deflationary properties of bitcoin can actually result is stability, via it's capacity to be divisible. But honestly, currency use is very far away in my humble opinion.
@_date: 2019-07-19 12:59:52
Ha yeah sure you got it all figured out buddy,  you know it all. Reality is, to trash Libra they've been singing Bitcoin's praises all week in an attempt to stress the difference between centralized and decentralized. Baby steps of course, but this week has definitely been a win for bitcoin moving forward and coming out of the shadows.
@_date: 2019-07-23 22:55:42
Not 5% either. Think about this - Many of the newsletters and consultants that advise people to buy precious metals estimate that between 1% and 3% of the American population owns precious metals. So there's just no way that 11% have bought bitcoin.

Your evaluation of dumb may differ from others, but certainly you can make the simplest observation that all technologies have a beginning and advance over time. Considering it's been 10 years and development efforts have grown, there's really nothing dumb about what I said. I have many investments, and bitcoin is one of them. That being said, nothing has brought returns even close to bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-07-10 00:32:07
Just tell it to them straight. Anyone who has cost averaged an investment in bitcoin is up money right now. Except those who went all in at once at the top price, which is incredibly poor investing (who buys all their stocks in one purchase?...same concept), anyone who has been buying in consistent, regular increments is now in the green. And this is just getting started. The Bitcoin base layer is being built upon. Upgrades are coming, plenty of them.

I remember this issue being discussed in great detail about 4 years ago or so. Bitcoin can add an element of democracy to the arbitration process so anyone can act as the arbiter between a buyer and a seller. It opens up a whole new industry really!
Bitrated can use multisig addresses to activate a third party as an arbiter. The best way it was described was that you you can now find a dispute resolution provider like you would find an Uber driver.
@_date: 2019-07-02 17:06:12
From my personal perspective and observation, far fewer people sell in the year leading up to halvings...which is why I expect this year to see far more accumulation. Plus, there's the fact that digital assets are new and with bitcoin in particular, there are far more people to enter the space as we move forward, but only the same supply.
@_date: 2019-07-10 14:50:38

Yes but there will be many lackluster weekends, so as long as the overall trend is growth, we best get accustomed to lots of sideways movement along the way.
@_date: 2019-07-16 21:14:38
I think the most bizarre thing about all the reactions on here is that many people don't realize how exactly the same they sound as the debbie downers back when the price was below $500. It's almost like travelling back in time but different usernames and less mining talk lol. People need to see what's coming if they want to make some $$$$.
@_date: 2019-07-01 19:18:57
What months were they? As I said there's only been 30 days ever that the price was higher than now so that makes no sense. Ive been dcaing for ages and am way up. The few weeks in 2017 barely even register. My stocks and other investments only give me 20% at the best of times.
@_date: 2019-07-03 00:49:28

Nobody is saying that. I mean literally nobody. If anything the US administration's plans to potentially manipulate USD to influence  growth in exports is helping Bitcoin. I realize that Bitcoin is far more than the US, but news like that does impact overall sentiment towards using Bitcoin as a hedge.
@_date: 2019-07-23 22:47:00
You're 100% correct. If you believe bitcoin will continue to increase in value as it has for the past 10 years, you DCA, and you understand the timeline that all technology takes to integrate with society, then every single dip is an entry point to buy. I like paying less for things that I am accumulating.
@_date: 2019-07-19 13:13:20
Hey blinders boy - they clarified all this. Did you watch the whole thing or just read the click bait crap? Illicit use is the security issue, not speculative investing. And Trump says a lot of things. We've progressed and no intellectual person thinks the whole "based on thin air" thing anymore because people are learning about network  value and the value of computer processing, security and energy used to maintain bitcoin. Anyway, this is ridiculous, you stay here all day and post till you're neck beard covers your chest hair for all I care.

Bitcoin has a value to today's world as streaming money, just as digging up shiny rocks did. The value is in the security, not just that it's blockchain lol.

No I don't see things that way at all. In fact, Bitcoin is a very small portion of my investments, though it has provided amazing returns on the money I've thrown at it over the years. I just find it very interesting to follow. I've worked in the IT networking sector for a very long time and in my opinion, Bitcoin is perhaps the most fascinating thing to come along. It covers multiple verticals and works exceptionally well.

"crashing" may not be the best choice of words, but why the dip you mean? Ummm, because  people are selling and then others follow, and then the dip gets bought and it rises again, etc etc. You know, bitcoin just doin its thing. All that matters is that since the beginning of this year, it's been up up up, as it will do for many years to come.

Just tried of same old fear tactics. Back when the tether issues was top of the list we all discussed the shit out of it. So listening to you bring it all up again is just redundant and not going to get us any further, or learn any more about it.
You're not debunking anything by cherry picking the sentences that are misleading like bitcoin is a national security issue. You should know that it's not that cut and dry because attempts to keep illegal activity out of bitcoin is a positive thing. So why did you present it as a negative, like a fud articke would do? We all know there are pros and cons to regulations, you don't need to post as though you're preaching because most of us on here are already aware. If you want to simply pass your thoughts on without presenting them as fact and preaching people would not be down voting you as often.

After 10 years it seems Bitcoin is finally getting the support and recognition it deserves:
- US Treasury secretary Mnuchin says there's no issue with Bitcoin just the illicit use. So basically don't use it illegally as all is well.
- Financial Services Committee Rep. Patrick McHenry says Bitcoin is "an unstoppable force. We should not attempt to deter this innovation … those who have tried have already failed.”
- House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy declared “I like bitcoin.”
- During the congressional hearing this week, Warren Davidson estabishes the difference between Bitcoin and shitcoin, and that no central authority can manipulate bitcoin.
A good week for Bitcoin indeed. Future looks pretty damn good.

Lets pretend for a minute that you actually talk this way all the time, and that you simply don't speak English well. If that's the case, then why would you choose words that are rarely used? You regularly imply that you are smarter than others because you say your meaning is lost or hidden from those of us who think your sentences are no more than jumbled words without proper context.
Answer this then: if you are so intelligent how can you not be smart enough to use vocabulary and grammar that will communicate more efficiently? A smart person doesn't communicate to showcase intelligence. They structure their sentences to effectively communicate and encourage a discussion. Don't you want the majority of those reading your posts to understand what you are trying to say? The ability to communicate effectively is a far greater measurement of intelligence than using obscure wording and trying to make a sentence illegible. Therefore, I draw the conclusion that you either an idiot because you can't forge a sentence, or because you try too hard to pretend you're not an idiot.

Hype and speculation is applied to the whole regulation thing. I think it's been made pretty clear that regulations will be geared towards mitigating illicit use of bitcoin. They have not implied that they have any issue with using bitcoin as a speculative investment like gold. Media likes to release "what if" articles to create FUD because it generates clicks and ad revenue. I highly doubt regulations will kill bitcoin and banning bitcoin is not in the cards or in any official communication we've received.

The future of Bitcoin has NEVER looked more promising. This kind of publicity was a pipe dream just 4 or 5 years ago.

This is necessary and it's immense progress.

It's just that you seem to care a lot more than me, and I can't make myself care more lol. I am onboard with bitcoin as a store of value, you know the whole digital gold thing. Currency use? My only opinion is that I believe the potential is there but far far away.

Even if by some astronomically low chance that Bitcoin fails, it won't happen in his lifetime because it's only just out of the gate and there's been so many millions pumped into its spinoff infrastructure with exchanges, apps, mining equipment, investment platforms, Futures, Fidelity, BAKKT, Ameritrade, Blockstream's satellite service, etc. He is fighting a losing battle.

There was no bitcoin boom, there was a very very short lived spike in the price growth of the coin, nothing more. The average yearly coin price has consistently been increasing, and is likely to continue to do so for years to come. For almost a decade, the infrastructure to support crypto has been growing and now its growth is accelerating rapidly. 
Those companies you mentioned regarding the dot com era are far more equivalent to ICOs, which were birthed from the Bitcoin blockchain. Those companies were a product of the internet, and Bitcoin is equivalent to the internet, not to the companies.

The number of  coders contributing to Bitcoin has trippled in the past year alone. Finding bugs and correcting them is a fundamental part of how software and systems advance and improve. So no, of course this doesn't decrease optimism, it increases it. Significantly.
@_date: 2019-07-16 23:35:04
Wow, well then perhaps I need to clarify. I have never predicted the price to be any specific number at any specific time. I simply believe that bitcoin will exceed its previously ath. If that's a price prediction then so be it, but that's about as specific as I get lol.

You post like you are bipolar. Nobody should ever believe a word you write. You obsess like a 5 yr old over deflation and volatility, have less understanding than 90% on here, and now claim inflation is the issue. You should just go away.
@_date: 2019-07-08 16:22:08
First of all 19% is unbelievable, no way it's even close to that. Second of all, currency use can easily occur once enough people own bitcoin, simply because unlike gold, Bitcoin's secondary layers can advance to almost endless potential. Certainly enough to allow it to function as both a value store and currency. I do however think that as long as the value continues to increase, which will be for many years to come as people store some of their wealth in bitcoin, it won't be widely used as currency. The volatility would have to diminish. Why spend something that could likely be worth more if you hold on to it.
@_date: 2018-09-28 01:08:22
Years before Bitcoin becomes the leading record keeper of digital transactions on the planet. And there will always be profit taking after every high along the way, so there's also years of peaks followed by corrections in my opinion.
I'd fold if the growth of platforms, code improvements, partnerships, etc stopped. The price always lags behind and catches up. If this stops, that's when I'd fold.

@_date: 2019-07-19 16:03:47
Can't you simply accept that many things can change over the next few generations and that a digital asset like bitcoin may see development that can address the deflation due to fixed supply? Or do you honestly think that you can accurately evaluate Bitcoin's future potential as a mainstream currency by using its current state as a measuring stick? Almost every disruptive technology that we use started off without anyone really knowing how it would truly evolve. Today's price volatility should not be used to evaluate how this plays out over the next few decades. We are still in early stages and discovery mode.

It's establishing the curvature and price leveling of the bottom as early purchasers and miners end the post-bubble liquidation phase. Then, as in past years, the next run up will be bigger, likely spawn more liquidation. Continues until we eventually hit a volume of participants so high, that the large sells have much less impact, and things move on a more level price for longer periods of time. 
This will take years but Bitcoin is well on its way to be the leading record keeper of transactions on the planet.

As long as volume is low enough to allow the price vulnerability to dumping, then it will continue to occur. Once volume is high enough to enable price immunity to the effect of dumping, then it will stop. Considering the rapid growth of infrastructure and framework, we shouldn't have to wait too much longer. Either way, we should be good in the end game.

I like this. Ive heard many analogies over the years and gave my own, some even related to music. When 50s rock came along many people tried to supress it, but the younger generation wanted music they could call their own. One of the strongest arguments to support cryptocurrency is the increased level of adoption we will see when the generation raised in a digital culture come online with investing. Anyone that believes they will choose digging rock out of the ground to stick it back in the ground again ... over the digital option of Bitcoin? That's simply delusional. Bitcoin will win, and crypto will be claimed as the currency of the next generation.
The analogy you used above was great. It takes time to replace these things especially something as embedded in our lives as currency.

The network value is what makes bitcoin worth buying. Network effect is what makes speculators go long on BTC. You can copy or 'fork' lots of open source projects, go to town on it ... that doesn't make it worth anything.
Ask any company how much a stable, secure and redundant network is worth to them? Bitcoin took ten years to provide confidence in its network - ten years of never being compromised. In this technical age of data, that hold a great deal of value and its the mining nodes and code contributors that make this all possible. Why do you think the number of coders on the bitcoin network have tripped in just the past year? You won't see that in a fork, lol.
@_date: 2019-07-21 23:01:03
Yes, and a lot of people in these subs are venting frustration from past losses and of course there will always be people who like to stir the pot. It's also easy to post basically anything you like when anonymous user names don't hold you accountable. 
All we can have in these early days of crypto is speculation for the future because technology tends to evolve through ingenuity and solutions we rarely predict. I have no issues with looking at the potential of failure, but it amazes me when people claim something is a guarantee to fail before it's even out of the gate.
@_date: 2019-07-15 13:36:46
Yes drops are great place to accumulate. Again I'm simply pointing out that even though I'm not into the whole whale conspiracy thing, there are plenty of major players, or market movers, that trigger price action. They are well aware of what the general consensus is with the majority TA projections. In the history of this market, when have you ever seen the price drop to the full extent of what's being called? Well, with the exception of the 20k correction but it didn't take much foresight to see how overextended we were then.

I couldn't agree more. I have lived through the adoption of home PCs, Cell phones, internet, online banking and more. When I look at cryptocurrencies and the rapid growth of global infrastructures, I think about what we may see in years not in days! I guess the bottom line is that if this thing was not going to become something bigger, I feel that it would have already fizzed out. Instead, it feels like it's just beginning!

@_date: 2018-09-25 02:00:28
And It was down going going down for almost 3 years 2013-2016, but who really cares if you're in this for the big picture. The infrastructure is being laid out, there's no stopping this train now. This year next year, whatever. The price will catch up...unless the armageddon happens, in which case we won't be thinking about crypto lol.
@_date: 2018-09-03 15:19:43
Absolutely. Great attitude!
@_date: 2018-09-28 03:14:14
Yes almost every q4 there is a pretty significant run up. The whole Mt. Gox thing screwed one year but yeah, it's a pretty strong pattern of run up, sell off, run up higher, etc. Basically, it's growth.
@_date: 2018-09-15 04:35:44
Not really. You should set the bar higher.
@_date: 2018-09-16 04:17:24
People are optimistic on bakkt futures. Nobody seems to really want to own a particular stance on the MS Starbucks thing. Anytime I've referred to bakkt I have always meant the futures.

Ha ha awesome.
@_date: 2019-07-20 00:57:51
Naw, you're just twisting the negative to the fore front of the narrative. Anyone can do that with anything.
First of all, you're making it seem like you just discovered this news, yet I recall Bitmex offering 100X leverage well over a year ago. So low alt prices are irrelevant. 
Second of all, just like you don't blame Vegas for people's behavior, people who love a high risk bet will gamble with high risk if they want to. Most people don't exceed 25x, and those who do were not forced to. So blaming the exchanges and calling it a dissapointment in technology is a hell of a stretch. You're sounding as ridiculous as Roubini.

Ahhh the anger stage. I've seen this many times over the years, and just like the past bubbles in price, the anger usually bubbles and pops too. It's usually around this point of frustration that we are very close to the end and the next upward trend begins. Because in Bitcoin folks, yes history has been repeating itself.
@_date: 2018-09-03 08:21:38
Ha ha, WAY beyond!
@_date: 2018-09-05 18:03:23
For sure. Problem is many in here are looking at the day chart lol. It's become a bad habit.
@_date: 2018-09-06 14:24:01
Unix and Linux are excellent examples, because like Bitcoin, they involve open source code contribution. The number of coders contributing to Bitcoin have tripped in just the past year alone. There is almost 0 chance of Bitcoin being replaced - it will simply be improved and layered for years to come. Yes nothing is definite but a hell of a lot would have to change in terms of the path Bitcoin is on. Plus, any other crypto would need 5-10 years just to catch up in terms of proving it has the foundation of a solid, stable and secure network tested under load to be worth building on. None of this is really being questioned anymore. It's just that many still judge Bitcoin on the price swings, when this has little to do with the bigger picture of what Bitcoin will become as we advance toward the future.
@_date: 2018-09-06 14:41:41
It might hurt your brain, but try and look ahead a decade from now. Look at what Bitcoin - the entity itself, not just the coin price - was a decade ago and what it is now. Consider EVERYTHING. The projects, the framework, the partnerships, the hype, and yes the exchanges and the investment portion, and now using logic, where do you honestly think it will be in another ten years? You think all this infrastructure growth is going to just vanish? It's only barely getting started.
@_date: 2018-09-13 18:07:19
Lol, no. It's one of the more positive developments on the horizon, so bitcoin enthusiasts look forward to this one. What is it about BAKKT that you dislike or feel negative about anyway? Using actual bitcoin as opposed to derivatives seems like a plus for Bitcoin, so to be honest I haven't really understood why you've been down on bakkt. 
@_date: 2018-09-09 01:13:51
He he that's pretty much the mentally that a lot of these people have sadly. Their capacity for ignorance of what is happening with certain things knows no end.

@_date: 2018-09-28 04:12:43
Growing infrastructure + finite supply = increased demand.
According to you, Increased demand = price increase. 
@_date: 2018-09-19 17:41:33
Totally. If you own property and the value drops, but you don't sell it till it's gone higher than you bought it for, you don't really care that it dropped for a period while you owned it.
@_date: 2018-09-18 10:45:10
You mean 5-6 years.
@_date: 2018-09-25 16:21:51
Well to be fair this is money we're talking about, and that's going to take time, as in years. Not to mention I would think Litecoin still has a place in small transactions, but again this is not something that can possibly happen overnight. 
Bitcoin will most likely work as an alternative to fiat first, functioning as both an investment and store of value with multiple benefits to traditional gold. Certainly as a much more attractive option to the younger generation who have come to trust the security and accuracy of digital encryption and accounting.
Anyway, the point is, the opportunity lies in getting in, while there are still people who raise doubt and uncertainty, because once it is a sure thing the investment opportunity will be gone, and the price will already have exponentially increased. That's how opportunity works.
@_date: 2018-09-26 22:47:33
I have no doubt the market will catch up to the framework. Not too soon though I'm not finished accumulating lol.
@_date: 2018-09-19 16:43:01
That's an easy answer. They would stop this when the price continues to rise, even if they sell. Basically, once the buy pressure overwhelms the sells, and that will require volume as more people jump on the train moving forward. This is a long game and anyone talking about short term price movement are doing so purely for entertainment. When the big players drop those huge loads of Bitcoin, they don't give any signals or means to predict this move. They may even make a big purchase right before selling off 3X the purchase amount. The short game is dangerous, at least IMO, my humble one. 
@_date: 2018-09-09 01:19:55
VET arguably has more partnerships than any crypto project out there. It also tackles the world of rfid tagging, supply management and inventory which is sorely in need of better solutions. Again, I'm not shilling because I dont walk the walk when it comes to ALTs, but just saying.
@_date: 2018-09-18 10:44:24
Naw, you're just having a negative morning. None of the things you just said are even remotely accurate.
You realize bitcoin has gone from pennies to over 6k without etfs right? ETFs, despite the conspiracy theories, is a result of demand, not of government wanting to control Bitcoin's future...just sayin.
@_date: 2018-09-15 11:11:33
Of course. High risk, high reward. That's kind of the point for many people investing in it.
@_date: 2018-09-03 13:36:58
Xelephonte is like the fool of reddit crypto posts lol.
@_date: 2018-09-26 21:52:25
That's not how it works. This is not shares of a company with good news or revenue projections priced into the stock. Bakkt will buy physical bitcoin for their futures offering, and if it becomes successful on a large scale, then purchasing a lot of bitcoin impacts the price positively.
@_date: 2018-09-03 13:40:18
That sums up your understanding very accurately. Thanks for admitting you have zero ability to comprehend price moves and influences. NOOB.
@_date: 2018-09-28 10:22:22
Part of me feels a little sad for you. You're so convinced that your opinion is fact, you see no other variation.
The way roads connect the people of a city, how the capillaries in your body deliver nutrients, the root system of a tree... if you don't see how the Bitcoin network growth will lead to inevitable demand via ETF/bakkt, onboarding apps, partnerships such as the starbucks thing, decentralized exhchanges, projects such as supply chain tracking, etc.
I'm talking REAL demand, not the hype that caused the price to spike to 20k for 5 minutes. Real demand.
Again, I'm kind of sorry you can't see this. But I understand that debatable topics rarely have a winning side.
@_date: 2018-09-15 11:05:14
No disrespect if you're actually serious, but this seems like some cowardly new way to be a troll without just having the balls to say those thoughts are your own (well..copied and pasted from dated FUD articles).
Anyway, last year called and they want their FUD back. All that BS has already been mythbusted a thousand times over, and a quick Google search would answer those questions.
@_date: 2018-09-28 13:44:09
I agree, but there is a steady, almost unstopable growth that has been happening for a long time, and I believe that it will result in many people wanting to have at least a small piece of the action. With such a small Bitcoin supply, compared to the number of potential investors out there, there's a strong likelyhood of opportunity for buying now and making serious profits later. 
Perhaps it will be just greed and speculation that drives it, perhaps currency use, maybe network value, store of value, gateway to other projects that may find huge success, etc. Nobody can truely know what the future holds, otherwise we'd all be rich. But with so much potential for success, I'm willing to risk losing x amount of money on the potential that within the next 5 years or so I may have many times more than what I invested. Even if it amounts to nothing more than a platform for speculation and more hands join the game, it's still worth being in that game before another big run up.
@_date: 2018-09-19 11:46:01
Banks and any institutions for that matter will most likely find a way to embrace new technology and trends in whatever way they can. Considering something a threat is not nearly as useful as finding a way to benefit from it. In the case of banks, they may get into offering crypro storage options and/or offer their own cryptocurrency, like Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group is doing.

You make a point but not unlike any investment, you don't lose until you sell. Twice before many people could have lost huge but gained by holding through the bear market. There's really no reason to believe anyone holding is a loser yet.  
Nobody knows how long it will take I realize that. But there is one thing for sure.. the future looks much brighter for crypto now then it did during the last bear market. So if it rebounded from that with no developments to look forward to, it can surely rebound from this.
Whether the price of BTC is $100 or $10,000, a 90% loss or gain affects your investment of any given amount in fiat the same.
@_date: 2018-09-20 23:27:01
There's little reason to believe that the parent company of biggest stock market in the world would not know exactly what the CFTC wants and requires.

Sure, if the last 6 months is all you can look at because some aspect of life kicked the shit out any optimism left in your brain. Reality is though, as you can see in the image I posted, anytime Bitcoin sunk it came back at much greater strength and ATH's. So, considering that we now have a stronger infrastructure than ever, the next ramp up is going to be epic.
@_date: 2018-09-18 15:36:02
Was there a catalyst that triggered the previous bull runs that were of far greater magnitudes than the 2017 one? People traditionally look for a reason for Bitcoin price movements, and click bait content creators love this very fact. They profit from it and contribute to it, but playing on the public's need to have everything explained in black and white. Everyone wants to hear that this or that is the reason for price change, but the reality is that it is a result of either numerous variables or a large sell/purchase by big players.

Bitcoin.com being run by roger bcash was already decieving and borderline insane...even without the app scenario. Newcomers to bitcoin are immediately led astray by the website that bears the one url they should be able to trust of all possible urls. Bcash has possibly done more damage to bitcoin than any other single entity. It was never needed to begin with and is the product of pure spite, selfishness and vanity.  The sooner it gets eradicated and becomes a part of mocked history, the sooner bitcoin can move forward without that irritating shit coin biting at its heals.
@_date: 2018-09-28 12:19:17
Well the blockchain logs it all as transactions I assume. I don't know of any charts though. I don't use charts to invest. Not in real estate, tech, AI, weed stocks, none of em. I look at potential for future and that can't be found on any chart.
A chart of transactions, as in purchases? There can't be many people using Bitcoin to buy things yet. Average person doesn't even know how to buy Bitcoin lol. Mainstream use is coming, but by the time we get there, the opportunity as an investment will be gone. That's why I'm so for investing now.

And those fine folks are sure as hell not going to sell now if they've weathered the entire year to date. This is probably the most likely time of this year to start seeing a big price hike since last year. Who in their right mind would sell now? Besides, everyone has to start somewhere. Just because they got in after that short price spike doesn't mean they haven't take the past 8 months to get educated. They're probably more informed and confident now than ever.

Because we are way past the point of "if", and well into the knowledge that it's just a matter of "when". 
Bitcoin is coming more and more out of the shadows and into our society every day. ETFs, bakkt (which is way bigger of a deal than any ETF), etc, it's all happening and it will be all reflected in the price eventually.

Why would you relate organic or non organic to losing money? There are many many ways to make money and to lose it, and you adapt your strategy and approach to suit the scenario. Besides, in these early days of crypto there is still low volume compared to what we'll see in 5 - 10 years. So, you only lost money if you panic sold anyway.

No, I just feel that while most people in this sub are focused on prices (understandable), there's a whole world of framework, coding, partnerships, institutional proposals, tests and trials, news articles, curiosity and an entire digital generation about to jump into investing their first few dollars. 
This taken into account, I'm not sure there's anything at this point that could stop the price from following the growth.
@_date: 2018-09-29 16:32:08

Just remember,  it's been a year of hearing calls for pull backs that were way lower than what we actually got. Expect the opposite of what most people think will happen, because those players with deep pockets are not just going to do what the majority expects. They never do.
@_date: 2018-09-02 15:57:18
BAKKT is what we should all be considering here. It is the biggest game changer coming down the pipe and while nobody can say for certain, there's a strong chance that when this hits in November, BTC price is going to catapult into prices we've never seen before. Just my opinion of course.
@_date: 2018-09-30 04:14:34
One day you'll say you never saw it coming. This is why, you simply choose to not see.

Yeah I recall text operating systems before gui and everyone was like what's an operating system? I also recall the first ten years of the internet before it worked it's way into households as a slow dial up and people were like what's the internet? It was still obvious that these things and any like them 'worked' and had a promising future. 
The reality is though, that while Bitcoin projects are partnerships are popping up at an accelerated rate, this is not going to happen without years of growth between now and mainstream adoption. Anyone that lacks the patience or wasted time in here complaining that next month is not the time, should perhaps look elsewhere for an investment interest... or try and time their trades with the big boys and profit off the price margins.

@_date: 2018-09-14 16:36:29
Nothing is 100%, guaranteed. But if it happens hundreds of times over a decade and you don't learn something from that repetitive pattern, you're either dumb, stubborn, ignorant or a little of all the above. History is hands down, undisputed, the best teacher on the planet.
Side note: yes there are countless other variables to consider, when trying to make some form of prediction for Bitcoin's future, but I am just addressing the logic behind why many assume that this pattern should not stop repeating any time soon.

I have about 5 monitor screens going on any given day because of my work and my interests, and I have been regularly scanning reddit now again for months.   
By the way, who have I attacked? You always make up this much BS about people? I simply remind people that the shit people are getting on with is the same shit they got on with for years, and BTC still kept progressing anyway.

Exactly. Plus, by very definition, a HODLer isn't selling because they believe in a future where current frameworks underway come into fruition. That's years away, so price movement now has no impact on their commitment to hold the investment.
@_date: 2018-09-28 12:06:34
Well now I wouldn't be banking on current demand now, nor would anyone else. No opportunity there!! It's the denand that follows the infrastructure that gets me smiling. Have you not paid attention to the past decade of this stuff at all? I suggest you get past this one year and look past that 20k spike. It was nothing more than an anomaly in a graph, spiked from hype.

Good, let them liquidate and get it over with. Redistribute the bitcoin amongst the many, that's how this needs to work. Patience is your best friend in the crypto space.

You repeatedly expressed that you hated bitcoin...on a thread designed to provide a place where people can find useful support and information.
@_date: 2018-09-03 08:13:40
Exactly. This guy is borderline insane. He insulted a young investor on here once and I called him out on his shit. Since then he's been insulting me on every corner like a childish little brat. I've never made a single prediction about anything on here. I simply stated the potential benefit of Bakkt. In 6 years, I have never seen such a child-like redditor. It's these complete idiots that give the sub a bad name.
@_date: 2018-09-30 18:58:33
Why don't you just go learn about what ICE are doing with bakkt so you can join the discussion with some input of value. Bakkt won't allow margins either, so no debt will be involved. Every position involves actual bitcoin that was purchased and if successful on a large scale, that could mean a lot of buying and significant price impact. All debates aside, you really can't compare this to CBOE futures.
@_date: 2018-09-30 02:57:39
Ha ha ha ha ...might be because they were using already established currencies? Oh, you know just a guess? Ha ha ha.

No, you've narrowed it down to the "sound" portion of the advice "as based on your opinion". I'm sure we're all guilty of leaving that out of our comments from time to time, but it's a pretty important fact that tends to encourage others to actually consider our opinions.

Do you understand the networking aspect of Bitcoin? Why it's the primary blockchain? You coild have 100 forks, but it's the vast majority of miners running the Bitcoin software that make the network what it is.
@_date: 2018-09-06 00:36:08
Judging by the comments there are still a lot of people that aren't buying bitcoin each time it hits that 5700-6200 bottom. It's done this so many times and yet people are not averaging in. There's a big future for this stuff and the infrastructure continues to grow. But until that time comes, buy the bottom and worse case scenario you break even.
@_date: 2018-09-25 00:31:43
It's been worthwhile for years, nothing has changed. Oh ...wait ..you're looking at month to month price moves ...errr, I mean week to week, no wait ....day to day, FAWK ..I mean hour to hour price moves??!!

Think of past innovations and past investment opportunities. Now this is not a lot like traditional stocks, but consider how long technological innovations take to integrate with society. Personal computing, cell phones, digital cameras, the internet, online banking, eCommerce, etc. Bitcoin has been around just long enough that we can say there's a very good chance that it isn't going away.
The global infrastructure is growing more every day and cryptocurrencies are being considered for countless applications. In all fairness, it will take years for the space to mature, but that's a really good thing from an investment perspective - because you don't want to invest in it then, when it's already soared in value, you want to invest in it now while there's still enormous growth potential.
Accumulate using money you can afford to take some risk with, and in a few years time you could be very thankful you did. The infrastructure will reach a point that allows easy on boarding of new investors, investment platforms and products will mature, and a new digital generation is about to jump in the game. Have patience and enjoy the ride.
@_date: 2019-07-07 13:56:29
Because you invest more than a couple of hundred dollars. In the crypto market, the stock market, real estate, whatever. A few hundred dollars every week, few weeks, or even every month, could eventually grow to a decent investment, but one $200 investment could bring you back thousands one day (which is still an incredible return, just not enough to make future plans on).
@_date: 2018-09-05 03:03:21
The user you refer to was beyond aggravating, and passive aggressive, constantly baiting users.  The very fact that you're washing over the facts is unfair to any mod involved. Sometimes it's difficult to look at things objectively, and that's why we have mods.
@_date: 2018-09-30 23:32:49
If you mean succeed as a currency then yes, I'd agree. But we're not quite there yet and I'm confident that we will be in time. That's why I said at this point in time. Bitcoin was created to function as a currency,  but over the past decade it's forged out a place as an investment, outstanding accounting system on an incredibly reliable blockchain network, and laying down the groundwork to become digital gold as a store of value. It's fair to say it's use as a currency has been postponed and will share the floor with the above.
@_date: 2018-09-29 07:47:41
That's kind of funny, considering any opinion of the future of crypto that I've expressed is based on at least a 5-10 year projection. I think you just jave a jaded outlook because you bought bitcoin when it was 20k for 5 minutes and you're not able to see how far it's come in 10 years. 
Either way, I'm pretty sure nobody really cares much about our opinions and of you wanna trail behind every opinion I post with you're dark little rain cloud, be my guest. Perhaps if you're around in 5 or 10 years you can call me wrong. I doubt it though :).
@_date: 2018-09-18 14:52:39
Ahhh the good ol "talking in circles".  A classic sign of somebody with nothing of any real value to say. So, then I'll take that as a "NO" you have never heard me moan and a "YES" you made that shit up.Bought at 15k? Hell yah, and every other k along the way lol. I plan to continue because I have accepted that nobody knows shit about where the price will be from one month to the next, but it always ends up a few steps higher than it was eventually. Look, you may think you got under my skin, and if that equates to some accomplishment to you, then I'm fine with you believing something that preposterous...though I suggest you set the bar higher. Truth is I'm gonna be here and continue to work and monitor Reddit and many many other sources until I retire so think what you want of my reddit presence ... I'm doing what I always do regardless of your opinions. Enjoy your day.
@_date: 2018-09-14 03:26:38
Boy you are really in the dark. Just about everyone who has done any investing knows that ICE is  Intercontinental Exchange—the trading colossus that owns the New York Stock Exchange. One may debate the impact that bakkt will have on bitcoin but everybody agrees that it's legit. If you are being serious right now I just don't know what else to say.
@_date: 2018-09-30 15:14:35
Wow bitcoin really butthurt you didn't it. You keep making your asinine comments.
I have never seen anyone reveal such desperation to convince others that Bitcoin is going to fail. I think you should go shout at kids to get off your lawn and call it a day
@_date: 2018-09-15 11:10:09
Sorry but you should wait a while before you buy crypto. Just buy it when it's significantly more in price so you can confidently avoid the risks you mentioned and there are safegaurds and storage solutions that require zero intellectual qualification.
@_date: 2018-09-20 10:31:32
For years now the crashes follow the peaks, and there's usually been a pretty significant bear market in between. Hopefully we'll get the hype back on some upcoming developments and the next crash will be after another ath. Either way, we've been here before and the bottom does seem to be holding at 6kish. There's a hell of a lot more to consider than bot trading though!
@_date: 2018-09-28 21:17:09
Money is a hell of a thing to transition. Kids learn to count money, and let's just say they won't be learning to count in Satoshi any time soon lol.
But as an exceptional record keeper of transactions, an alternative to fiat, a globally accepted currency and store of value, a legitimate investment... all of these are well underway.
@_date: 2018-09-30 03:14:05
Public interest is only just begun this past year, what the hell are you even rambling about. What public interest are you talking about, the 10 minutes of hype when it spiked? Man you noobs need to get some background before you make ignorant comments.
@_date: 2018-09-14 10:43:28
Ha ha. Everyone understands bakkt, and layman terms does not seem required by anyone but you. I won't justy your attempt to bait me into an argument so immature as to comment on the IQ of someone I have never met. I have accomplished more than i had initially expected in life, and not just financially. All these accomplishments were a result of both intellectual achievement and requirement. So you can imagine how funny it is for me to read your comment on my IQ :). 
It's people like yourself resorting to child like comments that is the reason the others in my investment group left this sub. I returned and simply continue to monitor this thread as well as hundreds of other resources. 
I won't humor you, but let me say that bakkt as a Bitcoin futures that allows participants to use actual bitcoin is exceptionally easy to understand. It's clear that the combination of physiological spinoff and the puchasing of actual BTC will be good for the space.
Now the deal with MS and Starbucks is a little more convoluted and I will say many people I've explained it to over the past 3 weeks have found it less clear than the bakkt futures. But it isn't really that difficult. 
In any case, you can say whatever you like about me, bakkt, and whatever else. Back when I bought my first few bitcoin I understood coding far more than the investment side of things, but in the past 6 years I have grown thick skin.
@_date: 2018-09-03 08:19:40
Do you even realize how clueless your posts sound? You should either wait until you're a grown up to post on reddit or try and learn a little bit about crypto before you post publicly and display your ignorance.

Logic - Bitcoin partnerships among mammoth companies are popping up all the time, the number of coders contributing to the open source code have tripped in the past year, a younger generation has been surveyed numerous times and consistently show a preference to owning bitcoin over traditional stocks, framework is growing at an unprecedented rate, it's easier to buy bitcoin now than ever before and this continues to be the case, it's not just limited to the US, it's a global entity, institutional platforms are in the works, and MUCH MUCH more. Big organizations see what's coming. You don't invest in the now .., you invest in the future.  Anyone that is truly determined to HODL has considered all this and could care less about what the coin price is today or next week. Without patience, there is nothing but bullshit and noise.

I get the feeling you'd hear whatever supports your bearish stance on BTC, so that's kind of your pre-loaded generic response.
@_date: 2019-07-16 20:42:31
What are you seriously talking about? I've said countless times that bitcoin will have to succeed first as a value store before it can ever be used as a currency. I've also said value store makes more sense because of less political resistence. We may not see main stream currency use in our lifetimes man. And for fuck sakes please stop talking like you have an understanding of economics any more than I or whoever. You can't just do some university course and 5 years later think you know it all. It takes many years. Please stop it, you sound like a child. Also stop pulling so called quotes from me out of your ass. This is enough time spent on this conversation. Go bug somebody else.
@_date: 2018-09-04 14:07:01
If the growth is accelerating slowing day after day, it will reflect the previous bull runs. It goes from taking a week to go up a few hundred ...to a day to go up a few hundred ..to 6 hours .... that's a bull run in classic form.
@_date: 2018-09-03 22:28:45
Naw, I just said it has more potential to influence BTC price than anything currently coming down the pipe... Because it uses actual Bitcoin and not built on derivatives. After 6 years in this market I honestly don't need you to explain to me how many variables are involved. You've overemphasized my enthusiasm for bakkt significantly, and I'm not really sure why.
@_date: 2018-09-13 14:27:01
Alot of people bought ether at those low prices. There's a lot of shit coins for sure but ether is not going anywhere. Failing ICOs dumped ETH, but that seems to be over...for now.

So tell me, when .... no wait, I'll give you the benefit of the doubt, "if" bitcoin hits 30k within the next 6 months/year, are you going to own your stance and admit you were way off the mark, or will you dissapear?
@_date: 2018-09-06 16:32:58
Of course not, but whether BTC is 6k or 60k, this is a contrast in perspectives that will be present for years and years to come. These conversations were had back when Bitcoin was 2k, so I'm guessing there will be always be someone calling us delusional... which is why only some people take the risk, and only some people reap the reward.  DCAing an investment that has gone from pennies to over 6k in less than a decade is not delusional, considering this thing is only now coming out of the shadows. That short period where the price bubbled up last year is no reason to loose focus.
@_date: 2018-09-06 21:00:43

I sincerely hope you are able to open your mind one day, because if you continue to focus on the rough patches in the road, you'll always miss the journey. 
Crypto is already up to over 6k in just a decade. If you can't understand how remarkable that is, then perhaps you're not intellectually qualified to even comment.

@_date: 2019-07-03 04:02:57
Sure, but you don't hear investors of the traditional markets constantly crying manipulation every time they lose money because of a bad decision. It's just an accepted factor of markets. Everyone who is sour about losing money in crypto along with everyone who simply wants to criticize the crypto markets, are constantly pointing to whales and manipulation. It's just getting kind of old.

@_date: 2018-09-06 22:46:56
No and I didn't say anything to imply I'm defending tether. I'm simply stating that tether neither needs to be defended or debated, because the whole thing is blown way out of proportion. I was here before the whole tether fiasco and Bitcoin does what Bitcoin does.
Consider the number of exchanges that bled alts into Bitcoin but do not exchange in tether. Could you see how Bitcoin becomes the gateway to tether  for massive amounts of money when all that alt value shifted position? People look but only notice the outer layer of this issue. Instead of reading the hype and repeating, it helps to look at all the information available.
@_date: 2018-09-30 15:31:03
Nobody knows for certain but it would be logical to assume that the big selling for the year is done. Considering almost every q4 has been a positive run for BTC (the year of Mt Gox that screwed us excluded), anyone that needed to liquidate would have done it by now and looking to profit from another end of year run.
@_date: 2018-09-28 00:28:31
Naw, it's just a sign of low volatility. Believe me if you want, but the real surge is coming.
@_date: 2018-09-01 18:29:24
Everyone's end game is to increase their position in BTC, even if they don't know it yet. I can't imagine why anyone would buy btrash intentionally but that's another story lol.
@_date: 2018-09-30 13:08:34
Not everyone understands the impact bakkt will have. They prefer to compare it to things like CME futures because they have little comprehension of how bitcoin price reacts differently to each.
In any case, even without bakkt, we're in great shape.
@_date: 2018-09-09 01:47:31
Ah everyone's favourite know-it-all is back! Wooo hoo! When bitcoin drops out comes the anti-crypto posters. I thought you were going to sit this one out for a while there.
So what have you got for us this time? More ignorance about tether? big conspiracies? How about BTC is doomed to drop below 5k?
Don't let us down now!
@_date: 2018-09-18 15:53:29
Opinions, or cherry picked theories are not facts. Bitcoin continuing to rise greater after each fall is a fact. I just addressed his assumption that I am deep in the red didn't I?  Most people who don't feel the future of Bitcoin is bright, usually resort to whale manipulation, tether theories, or use the mechanics of a traditionally traded stock or ETF to try and explain how a similar platform in the crypto space will fail. This space is chaotic, unpredictable and in these early days, easy to take advantage of. I fully believe this is typical behavior for a rising technology, let alone a tech that is open source and non centralized.   
If I hear something that hasn't already been said before the last correction and reversal, I'll be sure to offer my take on it ...for what little it's worth.
@_date: 2018-09-04 15:34:49

@_date: 2018-09-09 00:19:49
Same place I've been for years. Bitcoin's network has had 99.9% uptime and has never been compromised. The crap you're referring to is what will be improved with layers, innovations and coding solutions not even thought up yet. Thats how it works. Speed, capacity etc., that can be improved and will never stop evolving, it's the foundational components that provide the value and the proof of worth to advance to the next level of infrastructure.
@_date: 2018-09-12 13:58:21
I appreciate that many people use these charts as a source to paint a picture of the price path... but at this point it's pretty clear that Bitcoin is going to see a huge hike in price over the next few years. Cryptocurrencies are increasing at a rapid rate. I've never seen as much framework and global participation and buzz as we are seeing now. It's clearly only a matter of time before this leads to many more people purchasing crypro. Just wait until the late teens get onboard.
The coin price always dragged behind the infrastructure anyway. It's also important to realize that the big price swell to almost 20k that happened over a tiny time frame so early in the game HAD to drop back... of course any whales and average Joe's were going to take profits and this simply had to go on for a while. It's common sense. Now we need a price that follows the increasing framework, and the rest will be ...well... new history :).
@_date: 2018-09-24 13:09:23
Since yesterday the whole crashed? Are you referring the the couple of hundred up and down margin that's been happening? 
That's just a typical Bitcoin day.
@_date: 2018-09-30 13:21:40
Don't worry about volume. It's exactly as it should be at this point in time, with this lower volatility, and with little to gain in trading. Plus if you knew the numbers being traded in OTC, most people's jaw would drop.
What matters is the fundamentals. Crypto development is showing no signs of slowing down, that's for certain. Build it, and they will come :).
@_date: 2018-09-29 18:12:25

Interesting. So then what's your formula for fair price per usage? News flash .. there is no such formula. It's speculation of an enormous potential and most of us are OK with that because we see where this is headed.
Have you looked at the P/E ratios for some of the biggest company stocks out there? My point, you could make your argument about any overpriced stock, and many of these companies will have far less impact and disruption on the future than Bitcoin and crypto will likely have.

Once you own at least a bitcoin or 2, there's no harm in investing in a few alts for diversification. But yes, the end game for anyone in this space is to accumulate BTC. Don't let anyone tell you any different.

Yes, crypto is in its infancy stage and all the facts, particularly the growing infrastructure, point to a very bright future. People just need to grasp the timeline this kind of advancement requires. One day the average Joe will be paying with Bitcoin and investing in crypto, and think this all just happened overnight.

Crypto is redefining the concept of state or government tied money. That's what makes most arguments against it moot... traditional stances don't apply because Bitcoin is not American, or European, or Canadian or Korean etc. It's global!

All coins are priced in BTC. If the USD value of BTC drops than the USD value of all coins drop. There are other variables of course but this is the big one.
@_date: 2018-09-06 17:24:28
There are so many, every day there are more than I could ever keep track of. One I noticed earlier this morning was between Post Oak Motors (Rolls-Royce, Bentley and Bugatti) and Bitpay, to start accepting Bitcoin payment for luxury vehicles. I also saw a headline announcing some ATM Maker partnering with Cannabis Dispensaries to enable payment solutions. You can find this stuff everywhere, but as for investing in the stocks for these companies, I've found that associating with blockchain and actually implementing blockchain are two very different beasts. Simply associating can cause a very temporary price hike in shares that is short lived. This is where Bitcoin got wrongly compared to the dot com bubble, but it was in fact bad actors with blockchain associations that shared the characteristics of the dot com era.
After my experience with the 2008 market correction I have been putting my faith in the long game opportunity stocks, so I may not be the best person to offer any stock market info lol. As for crypto partnerships, just do the research - there are plenty of opportunities out there!
@_date: 2018-09-12 13:46:57
These articles want clicks because visits = $, simple as that.
The more dramatic the headline, the more likely they get a click which increases revenue from CPM ads and potential additional clicks on PPC ads. That's not to say the articles are always inaccurate, but how they spin the information is usually with the purpose of pushing their own agenda.
@_date: 2018-09-18 17:36:58
Well if you don't eventually convert those alt coins to BTC, what exactly is your end game? You can hate BTC but accumulating it is not a bad idea.
@_date: 2018-09-25 22:24:46
Umm, no. The internet was initially developed in the 60s, and used in a niche environment, not unlike Bitcoin actually. Over the next 30 years it was improved via updates such as TCP layering and protocols. Finally in the 90s, it began to transition into mainstream usage.
Bitcoin is doing amazing in terms of speed and advancement. Do you have any idea how much easier it is to buy bitcoin today than it was just a few years ago? 
@_date: 2018-09-30 05:22:42
Of course. Think about when you cold storage your crypto...passwords, wallet addresses, authentication etc. Eventually this will all be made simple for average joes
Give it time.
But come November every serious crypto investor I known is going all in again just like we have previous years..it's become somewhat of a ritual. Your prediction of a lower price is not happening. Add bakkt to this and it's even more likely that there's another runup.
@_date: 2018-09-18 13:10:06
With Bitcoin price, **ANYTHING can happen**. Think it's unrealistic to assume Bitcoin price will double before EOY? Triple? I snagged this image from a tweet from Trace Mayer.

The next few years will see massive growth in this space. There's going to be a hell of a lot of people kicking themselves for not buying at least some Bitcoin below 8k prices.
@_date: 2018-09-18 14:43:48
How many people do you think have invested in Bitcoin? Take a guess? How many more do you think will? How many people of the next generation do you think might give it a whirl? You think they'll continue to dig rock up out of the ground when they have never ever visited a physical bank in their lives? It's a game of exponential volume increases at the end of the day and when this shit kicks in, you are going to have one hell of a time trying to explain your way out of your current stance. I'm telling you, forget everything you think you know about the traditional stock space and embrace where this is headed. You'll thank yourself.

It's actually crashed 90% before. Pay little attention to media click bait. Aside from the height of the last peak, bitcoin is doing what it always does. Difference is, the peaks are getting dramatically higher. Bakkt coming in November will be a nice catylist too by the way.

You sound like a pissy little brat. Someone's got issues and venting them in reddit lolol. I'm not giving any advice... simply stating a fuckimg fact. Grow up and look back. Anyone that bought between 5800 and 6200 this year is in fine shape. If you don't agree that change the facts.

Wow ..REALLY?? Nobody EVER made that argument before! You mean there's no room left on earth to evolve and look toward alternative stores of value? No way we can adapt, adopt, evolve, advance? We are doomed to digging up rocks and putting them back into the ground with name tags on contracts that say we own a piece of something we'll NEVER actually see or hold or smell or touch? Wait a minute.... oh hey there's this thing called bitcoin that provides a similar but superior accounting system, backed by redundancy and perfect math. Maybe you've heard of it? Maybe a newer, smarter generation will shift towards this as opposed to continuing to dig up and store these heavy rocks for eternity! ...just a thought, maybe I'm crazy :)

My naive optimism? Clearly you're either new to crypto or you're oblivious to how much it's grown over the past few years. Exchanges, partnerships, and a rapidly growing number of very large organizations biting at each others heals to be the first to secure an ETF.
If you're only looking at the price of Bitcoin, you need to crack your shell and get informed.
@_date: 2018-09-28 03:49:38
Growing infrastructure + finite supply = inevitable price increase. There's not a time or a price where I would throw in the towel, it would be when infrastructure growth stops. Lower price while there's still growth would just mean buy more.

Interesting, I'm saying we have a long ways to go and you're calling it crap. I guess the only thing you'll agree with is if someone says we're just going to revert back to the state of crypto as it was 10 yrs ago and just be oblivious to everything that has been built around it. Crypto is a small portion of my investments but I very much am aware of what's happening and of the potential over the next few generations. Not sure how that's crap.

@_date: 2018-09-19 13:45:51
Those who bought BTC at low prices years ago may want to take some profits now, because they don't want to wait for Bitcoin to go to 20k+ again. It doesn't really matter in the long term, let them sell, and let those bitcoins be redistributed I say! It's still going to continue rise in price for years to come, and there will also always be bear markets here and there in between the bull markets just like the last decade has shown us.
@_date: 2018-08-05 05:21:21
So what. If you can, try to buy it when you think it's in a range close to the bottom and do this each time it dips. Once the price catches up with the rapid advancement we see in framework, this simple strategy could bring in some hefty long term gains.   
If you worry about the price bouncing between 6-10k, you could be worried for a long time. Buy it during the lows, and your worst case scenario is breaking even. There's too much viral activity and effort underway to see Bitcoin going away, and once it acquires the volume of investment needed to initiate new ATH's (and I believe it will), your future self will thank your present self for having a realistic perspective of how long it takes these things to evolve and see mass adoption.
@_date: 2018-09-29 14:52:27
It's positive to see so many large organizations biting at each others heals to go down in history to be the first to secure an approved bitcoin investment product, because it means that it's almost inevitable that one will eventually get the green light. But it also seems orchestrated that starting at the end of each year everything starts looking positive in news articles, almost as though MSM purposely shifts public sentiment. Coincidence? Oh well, either way, it's looking like a run up is incoming, and I'll take it lol.

@_date: 2018-08-27 11:29:41
@_date: 2018-09-06 00:45:18
It's a simple matter of profit taking and repurchasing at a lower price. There's no real worry about it dropping below 6k because it's not just panic selling that causes massive drops that occur within 15 minutes lol. It's clearly single or small number of entities at work. They rebuy at lower cost and this has been happening rinse and repeat and will likely continue until volume of small players overwhelms the amount controlled by whales. This could be in months or years. Either hold for the end game, or trade with the market moves and go along for the ride.
@_date: 2018-09-09 00:50:30
Good points. Long term though, BTC is king, and a few alts including ETH, XLM, VET and a handful have strong future potentials.
@_date: 2018-08-18 04:49:07
Of course they do ...it's called being a pompous ass, who is too brainwashed into one mindset to see past their own ignorance. It's quite common but guess what? The smart ones do not laugh at Bitcoin. They laugh at you. You're a consultant to finance? How many people do you have running around with tinfoil hats on afraid of the tap feature on their bank cards and crying conspiracy theories out their asses?
@_date: 2018-08-21 17:05:25
Well if you're thinking this way, how many other are as well? Hence the dip may be little more than a slight drop. Any ETF that does not require the purchase of Bitcoin will only have a hype effect and less permanent impact as an ETF that does. Still, it will create the spinoff of contributing to a feeling of legitamacy and certainly open the door for a flood of ETFs that will inevitably come down the pipe.
Personally, I see the ICE Futures coming in November as the strongest potential for Bitcoin and the coin price. They will be stockpiling Bitcoin and that's the kind of activity that increases price and removes actual BTC from the supply.
@_date: 2018-08-13 19:55:34
All we can do is wait. Typically when a new technology comes along there's a company with a huge marketing budget to promote it. All Bitcoin gets are clickbait articles.
The other kind of promotion is hype, such as "so and so made a fortune by buying Bitcoin" which happened last December.
Other than that it's just a matter of time and mass adoption. I'm very confident that it's coming but unless some ETF news or huge incentive to drive hype comes along it realistically has to take time, as the framework creates easy acquisition and onboarding. Patience and buying the lows is the only strat that makes sense in this space.
@_date: 2018-08-18 05:40:09
Exactly. You don't buy Bitcoin  you buy it now.
@_date: 2019-07-21 22:52:45

I don't know the whales and how poor or rich they are does not change my life. I heard about crypto it was a nerd domain worth pennies. Now it's worth over 6 k in less than a decade. This kind of thing comes along once in a lifetime, so when you're telling your friends about it try to remember the fact that it's gone up more than any stock they could hope to invest in and will likely continue to for years and years to come.
@_date: 2018-08-06 21:30:07
I am only trying to point out that a rise to much higher prices will take much longer than from Jan to now. It will take years and I'm OK with that, because that's how technology evolves. It needs to be something people can acquire easily, like a website URL. If people had to use the actual IP address instead of the domain name it's translated into, far fewer people would have gotten on board. And that's only one simple example.

You're a bit slow to the party I see. This debate has been done and no, you are not right. If you don't understand how Bitcoin brings value, then you can use Google and bring yourself up to speed. However, there is certainly a great deal of speculation involved, yes, because much of that value will only come to fruition if and when adoption increases. 
@_date: 2018-08-17 00:10:19
Because their criticisms were baseless to begin  with. Even after Bitcoin is adopted on a mass level and the coin price is over 100k, people will still be bashing it. 
It's been this way for years. Even now that the price is over $6k people are still criticizing Bitcoin, and all I can think is are you still this delusional? People said the same exact shit back when it was 200 bucks and they will be saying it for years to come until the complacency dies with them. If all you can see is the little window of time when it fizzed up along the way ...out of a decade of growth ...you don't deserve to be on the ride.
@_date: 2018-08-23 14:56:34
2020 is a bit soon to expect a radical change in something as integrated into society as money. Some technologies can go mainstream in 5 to 10 years but not to the extent of replacing a currency system. That will take a very long time. Kids won't be learning to count satoshies instead of dollars for a long time. But Bitcoin and the global framework to support it is advancing quite well. The apps you can access now to purchase and store crypto and way ahead of what was available a few years ago. Advancement is happening, nobody can deny that. As a store of value and investment, we could see mainstream adoption by 2025 easily. Bottom line - buying a Bitcoin now at 5-7k, and owning it in 10 years when it may be worth over 50k is as worthwhile of an investment as anything out there.

Look, anyone who thinks this past decade of crytpo getting off the ground was enough time to change something as difficult to disrupt as a monetary system.... are complete morons with zero capability of comprehending the timeline needed to implement that kind of change. But it most certainly does NOT mean it isn't coming down the pipe.

10%?? Dayam, I hope you're better at some other things than you are at math. Bitcoin is a rising tech, it's so obvious that my 8 year old nephew told me he wished he'd asked for some for his 5th birthday, His peers all the way up to young adults are all over this. They talk about it regularly. Just wait a few more years when they have influence over global finance.
Anyway, I digress. You are a crypto bear, that's fine. Nobody cares about you or me or any of our opinions on here. But the future is happening with or without us and it's as clear as reading a book. It's playing out like a book with crypto developments and advancements made on every turn. STOP looking at the price. It's gone up IMMENSELY since its inception, more than any of us ever even fathomed.
None of us thought we'd see BTC over $1000 back when we started. To think even back, it still feels surreal that it has made this much progress.  Bitcoin is an unstoppable rising innovative tech. It's path is undeniable, based on what it has accomplished in such a short time. That blip of bubble in Dec past is not what you should be focusing on if you're smart. But then ... your math is pathetic.

People usually react that way to the prospect of something that is so unfamiliar to them, because it sounds unlikely. So yeah, it's a good chance they know very little about it. That's not an insult or a negative. If you're not in to something you don't take time to learn much about it.

@_date: 2018-08-08 14:28:41
There's no need to call them morons. You're not considering the spinoff effect of an ETF, which could very easily create a public perception of legitimacy that would lead to a vast many x more modest investors in the space. That volume would overwhelm the opportunity to manipulate within ETFs and futures. Most people who want an ETF will never be able to afford to buy into one. They just want the validation that it would provide. Either way, we're a long ways off from the volume required to bring Bitcoin prices to new ATHs.
@_date: 2018-08-29 17:22:41
You got in over a year ago, and your judging a decade on that one shitty year? You're either exceptionally impatient or you haven't dug into the reality of what's happening in this space. You'll get your money back and much more but you absolutely have to grasp the timeline here.
@_date: 2018-08-16 04:18:17
But why, this is just speculation. And not new speculation either. This accusation has been made over and over and yet here we are still talking about it. Look, I agree they should let a proper audit put this to rest but it just can't be as simple as wash trading because that's too simple and they wouldn't get away with it.
@_date: 2018-08-29 17:02:19
Throughout the progress and advancement of any tech or innovation there has been, and always will be, people like yourself who can't see the forest through the trees. 
All the details you are referencing are quickly becoming overshadowed by far more positive developments. Your lack of ability to see past the negative aspects place you among the complacent and one dimensional individuals. It's normal to have those with your viewpoint and your resistance to accept the reality of progress that is underway... it is a necessary component of that progress.
Criticism challenges the effort to improve the framework and sometimes even sheds light on issues that need to be addressed. Personally I would think it sucks to be on your side of the equation because we're way past the point of doubting that this thing is happening, and now is the time to be accumulating, not denying the inevitable.
@_date: 2018-08-22 03:12:15

@_date: 2018-08-29 17:07:29
The conspiracy theories are typical when people reach for justification of their negativity on any new innovation. In the case of crypto, the naysayers have really ran with the tether thing. They have no comprehension of the way tether works and how massive volume in tether is perfectly understandable. Take the Korean exchanges for example. All those alt coins that had their revenue drained out to tether. If the exchange does not deal with tether then the alts are typically converted to BTC and transferred to an exchange that does offer tether trading. That's just one of many variables not considered by the conspiracy theories.

It's just investing in something that happens to be a hybrid type of entity. It's use as a currency will likely emerge from the very fact that more and more people will possess it... as a result of it becoming more and more easy to obtain as technical barriers are coming down. 
That being said, this is years down the road and for now, children are taught to measure currency in Fiat ..not Satoshies. Bitcoin will supplement FIAT before it replaces it, because you can't skip to step D without going through A, B and C. 
Till then we measure in the currency we know and were raised on. Bitcoin will likely continue to evolve and if history has taught us anything, it's that you invest in a rising technology BEFORE it becomes mainstream.
@_date: 2018-08-04 03:58:55
You probably already know the answer to your own question. Since Bitcoin is global, which government are you referring to? There are quite a few. Oh, and FYI, Bitcoin's value is in the potential it holds for the future. If you invest in something once it has already made its value clear, then you're just playing it safe. To make real gains, you invest in the potential for future value.

 Bakkt is very real, and is happening in November. Why would hundreds of news sources and user forums all make up the exact same story? Sure there may be complications, as in any launch. Hell they even face regulatory road blocks, but it's not fictitious. Where did you hear it was fictitious?
@_date: 2018-08-11 02:39:31
Well if you bought since 1k you realize the real trend is up, and everything else is noise and bullshit. Bitcoin has a brilliant future in online exchange. Unfortunately, there's been so much noise and clutter surrounding the coin price this past year, anyone new to the game will have to step back with a clear mind to see the potential and the path that  bitcoin remains steady on.

@_date: 2018-08-19 12:08:01
Hey all, are we going to focus on the positive today, and the reason we're here... or will this thread get dominated by the gloom and doom spreaders, who feel so crappy about themselves they have to try and make us doubt ourselves as well?
I've come to realize a few things about Bitcoin pessimists and naysayers. You can provide them with knowledge of all the reasons why it is very likely that Bitcoin will be worth a great deal more than it is currently. You can provide specific facts and details regarding global developments... but you can't make them think.
Some people want to remain stuck in a tiny perspective, and focus on bubble talk, tether conspiracies, and all the reasons why Bitcoin will fail. They prefer to criticize Bitcoin because the truth requires them to change their traditional view of currency and investing. That's very hard for some people so they attack, because that's easier.
Here's the thing. People who are trolls often say "hey man what's wrong with thinking Bitcoin will fail and thinking that investing in it is stupid?" Well, nothing, but you're on a fucking Bitcoin reddit group!! 
Do you go to a cave diver's reddit group and call cave divers idiot's because it's risky? News flash: WE KNOW BITCOIN IS RISKY.  That's why we do this, we believe it's worth the potential reward and we believe in that potential.

But yeah .. keep that retirement fund safe though...nothing in life is guaranteed!
@_date: 2018-08-10 14:22:55
Yes, but have a look at the P/E ratio for some of the biggest stock shares. People often criticize Bitcoin for it's speculated value but this is nothing new. Just because we can justify the over inflated value of stocks by saying that a give company "could" increase their earnings or could have an upcoming partnership etc, it doesn't make it any less a form of specualtion.
I realize this is a different beast and I am the first one to say that comparing Bitcoin to traditional stocks is not logical, but the concept of oversold and baseless prices will find it's way into all investment markets one way or another.
@_date: 2018-08-29 20:55:07
The difference is, you only show up when it drops so you can act like you actually have any understanding. Then you slither back to your parents basement. All this does is solidify how little you know about any of this. The only basis you provide for your criticisms of Bitcoin is that 2018 was a bad year. You clearly have zero knowledge of the space and you're making that clearer with every stupid post you write.
@_date: 2018-08-16 21:19:55

Comparing the things we discuss in the crypto space now to what we discussed 5 years ago, it's incredible just how far this industry has come in such a short time. Yet we still make such a big deal over a decision on one ETF. If advancement in the space continues at this pace, ETFs will be common place before you know it, and I can only imagine the changes we're going to see in the next 5 years.
@_date: 2018-08-06 21:20:34
He probably tells them that Bitcoin is in the very early stages of what could very likely become a great force as a store of value and currency. So as a long term investment, the risk has strong potential to bring great reward.
He also probably tells them that anyone who is impatient, does not grasp the concept of how long this logically HAS to take, and doesn't understand thatvthey should never invest more than they can afford to lose should move on.
@_date: 2018-08-29 17:13:16
If you like to short BTC, that's your business.  But when you come in his thread blowing bullshit out of your uninformed ignorant blowhole, in hopes that your insignificant opinion could ever possibly influence the price, well that just reeks of how very desperate you actually are.

Which is good. News and media had way too much control. When the price goes up because more people are buying it, see value in it, and when better investment products that actually purchase bitcoin drive the price up, that's when organic movement upward may actually be a reality.

Eventually they will have to. Until then it's really just a conversation like we're having here now, and nothing but theory and baseless accusations.

A 5 year old could crack that case.

Oh well I guess we're all retarded because we want to take a high risk for the possibility of a high reward. Considering anyone with a clue and the ability to do a little research can comprehend that buying Bitcoin today makes 1000x more sense than buying it when it was 15k.
But hey ..wait a minute this is a reddit for a high risk / high reward investment anyway. SHOCKER ..people in here are buying bitcoin!

@_date: 2018-08-16 10:56:24
I've watched Bitcoin go from pennies to thousands ( no, I didn't buy at pennies, but I know people who mined it then. They are happy today). I have never once felt negative about this incredible opportunity. The only negative people are those who started out a year or so ago. I've heard all the same shit from all the same kind of people and every single time people go from gloom and doom to giddy little bi-polar fuckers. The next run up will be insane, mark my words.
Don't get me wrong... we need people to be all afraid, we need people to question the space and be fearful, we need conspiracy theories about tether... We need all this to create the risk reward balance that creates the craziness of it all. Otherwise everything would be a bubble and the space would not be what it has become for anyone that can look past a one year window.
We also need people to criticize the speed, demand more from the technology. That's why the coding community for Bitcoin and crytpo has tripled in size in such a short time. It's up to you which side of it all you want to be on. Either way, just know that your negativity will not stop the insane growth of the crypto space.
@_date: 2018-08-15 22:21:55
After the past 8 years of Bitcoin movement, to say that it will take 3 years to hit $8200 is ludicrous. It has never been easier to purchase and it has never had as much global growth in framework. The next time Bitcoin starts running up (like it has multiple times over the years) it will be of the likes we have never seen. 
@_date: 2018-08-20 02:03:58

Of course man, I agree 100%, that's common sense of you're able to think with innovation. Financial people are ironically the worst and the last when it comes to thinking outside the box. Basically, governments will do whatever is best for government, and it is not uncommon at all throughout history for government to switch gears on a stance, if they find a way to make it work for them. A lot can change within a decade, and like or not government officials can side with demands of the people of it means winning an election or keeping their position.

Long as he continues to buy on the lower end he's fine. That way, when it drops back, the worst case scenario is a break even. It's likely the bottom will gradually rise and people in this scenario will see gains.
@_date: 2018-08-30 15:51:25
A couple of hundred drop means nothing, just like a few hundred gain - this is just normal BTC movement. It can't go straight up! This guy knows that, he's just yanking your chain because he, like several redditors on here, are not here to learn or share - just to get reactions from their negative posts, because they know there are passionate bitcoin supporters on here. I've been on reddit with 3 different user names over the past, and the investor group members I am with used to all post here regularly. There were trolls and and the odd person that never thought Bitcoin would become what it has then too. But everyone in my group left because the ratio started to shift from useful sharing and help, to whining and negativity and lambo talk.   
I came back with this username because I still believe there can be value in this platform, but you really have to not let the bullshitters bother you. The world is pretty well aware that crypto is going to be a very large part of its future, with Bitcoin as the crown jewel. I have never felt more certain about this in 6 years than I do at this very moment.   
Keep up your hopium and keep up your sharing. People like your posts.
@_date: 2018-08-23 14:36:29
You couldn't possibly know what I think. Bitcoin critics are all the same, you oversimplify and think Bitcoin supporters are all of the same mentality.

@_date: 2018-08-18 14:01:25
I gained and I lost many times. I bought on the way up to ATH and I've been buying all the way down. I feel more confident than ever in the future of crypto in digital exchange. So buying crypto is my way of betting on what I believe that future looks like.
Now if you really think I would be naive enough to think for even a second that anything posted in here could possibly impact the price of Bitcoin, then you have no comprehension of the magnitude of investment required to do that.

There's little to expose outside of a  conspiracy theory. The Tether market cap expands and deflates right on par with the movement in and out of Bitcoin, as a source of  liquidity to enable fast pace trades. There are issues that tether creates, yes, the enabling of pump and dumps being the main one. But pump and dump trading only hurts those who are gullible enough to fall for it. 
@_date: 2018-08-22 02:29:10
You sound very desperate for the price to go down. So many Bitcoin bashing posts, as if you can will your criticisms into reality.
@_date: 2018-08-06 14:50:12
Also worth mentioning, even though you can keep the coins in your Shakepay wallet (and I have for weeks sometimes) it's always a good idea to send them to a cold wallet like the Ledger Nano, or if it's not long term, to your favorite exchange like Binance.
@_date: 2018-08-08 18:47:47
I'd agree with you but then we'd both be wrong.
@_date: 2018-08-08 11:54:45
There's no reason to assume big players would continue to take profits below $5500, because they've been having enormous success with the rinse and repeat of taking between 6 and 10k.
Over the next few years as the holders of vast amounts cash out, and trading options mature in this new and volatile space, this will all work out fine. Buying anytime the price drops below 6k is a reasonable strategy, whether you try and time your selling with the big players or just hold is a personal decision. I prefer buying low and holding out for a few years, and after a very long time, I'm convinced I'll thank myself in 5 years or so.
@_date: 2018-08-05 05:12:58
I don't disagree with that at all. My only stance on Bitcoin has been one of future potential. Despite coin price volatility, the growth in supporting technology, exchanges, apps, awareness and much more continues and does not suffer from this volatility in any way. So I see the price stability eventually catching up with the stability in framework advancement. I don't doubt for a minute that Bitcoin and crypto investments will never dissipate to a point where the coin price would completely tank. Until the price catches up, modest investing during price slumps may be the best strategy for long term gain.
@_date: 2018-08-06 20:56:41
And that's exactly what I'd expect you say. Broadcasting your outlandish opinion on a reddit group full of people who clearly feel the opposite is simply begging for attention.

"Too late to buy at today's price" is what I said.  But in my experience, negative people will extract what ever meaning they want. I was merely referring to the investment aspect of the hybrid entity of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-08-17 14:51:21
People burned out from last year represent a tiny fraction of potential investors out there. What is needed for another bull run is some catalyst to kick start the entry of new money from new investors. Volume is key. Millions of small investments from every average joe and their taxi drivers will overwhelm the power whales currently have.

Things can only move so fast. Consider for a moment that all those people you are referring to who jumped on board in December only represent a tiny fraction of potential investors. As I am sure you know, the vast majority people have still never purchased Bitcoin. That's an awful lot of overhead left in terms of room to grow. This thing has only begun.

Of course, but it simply rocketed too high too soon and had to correct. People who have been involved in this for at least 3 or 4 years are comfortable for a good reason. We have seen massive progress already and it's not slowing down at all. Don't focus on coin price, that will catch up in due time. And you won't care about the path or ups and downs it took along the way.

All markets contain some manipulation, but in these early days of the crypto market there's going to be more.
But let's be realistic. There's no round table where a handful of big players gather and plan to synchronize manipulation. The manipulation conspiracy is blown way out of proportion. You can either try to time your trades with the pattern of sell offs, or buy at what you think is low and hold until the growing framework onboards enough participants to allow healthy growth. Staring at the week to week price movement will skew your perspective and inevitably leave you jaded.

You got it right. This is the wild west, the early stages, the chaos of crypto, the period where  nobody knows how to value any of his stuff. Framework of apps, exchanges, ETF plans, speculation, payment infrastructure, tech improvement layers to the Bitcoin blockchain etc...it's growing at an accelerated pace. Once it becomes easy to acquire for everyone and begins to feel legitimate on a global level, the coin price will catch up. It will be too late to buy Bitcoin at today's prices by then of course, but we have quite a few rises and dips to see yet. Grab em while ya can lol.

@_date: 2018-08-19 07:07:19
We've seen the bottom 3, maybe 4 times now, so yeah there's a good chance that 5700-6k is the bottom. But telling people like you that is like trying to tell a 5 year old that they don't need a certain toy. They won't listen no matter what you explain they need to learn for themselves. I've been in this shit goin on 8 years,  and I've lost and won and see a lot of people like you along the way. I try to pass on some info and you stick to some stupid little theory about one thing and you can't even try and mix up the narrative...like a robot with one basic program ...tethers bad...ETFs bad, Bitcoin like tulips...the same shit I've been hearing for years. You will be wrong..like it, disagree with it, nobody gives a flying fuck. This is another year of massive progress despite your shallow perspective and ignorance of how this shit is integrating with the fabric of society. The coin price will catch up, whether you shout at bitcoin like an old senile man or not. When it does....again just like it always has, you will squirm away in the shadows and not let anyone tell you how wrong you were. Just watch...you'll be nowhere to be found once BTC is over 30k.
@_date: 2018-08-09 17:01:06
Why not just buy a little Bitcoin every once in a while, with money you won't really miss. Eventually when the early days of this market are past and trading options for the crypto space mature, your investment could easily be worth many X more than its initial value.
Why in God's name would you allow such a trivial thing to stress you out, when you could simply just be rational about the time this takes. Watching the price bounce around every day is for people who believe that trading is a good use of our most valuable asset in this life - time.
@_date: 2018-08-29 04:41:17
To anyone out there that has still not caught on:
Xapo, in Hong Kong, is a Bitcoin vault company already storing over $10 billion in Bitcoin on behalf of institutions. The BoA have a crypto vault project underway to allow enterprises to safely store large amounts of digital assets providing a platform for large institutions to allocate large sums of money into the crypto sector.
In November, The Bakkt digital asset platform will provide a global network using Microsoft cloud-based services for physically-settled Bitcoin Futures contracts. This is a joint venture created by Microsoft, Starbucks, and the New York Stock Exchange... pretty serious players if you ask anyone with a clue.
The number of coders contributing to Bitcoin open source have more than tripled, apps and user friendly tech to onboard new users/investors are growing rapidly.
Multiple ETFs are being proposed and revised on an ongoing basis, and regulations are forming. Mainstream media are all but promoting crypto because it brings strong viewership and public awareness which is increasing by the day.
On top of all that, physical over-the-counter infrastructure is growing out of control and this is just the start.
Now if this happened in a small time frame, can you even begin to imagine where this will be in a few more years?   Average Joe's not involved in this space will clue in once Bitcoin is a mainstream investment and accepted as an alternative currency...just status quo, and they will think all this happened overnight, like the tap feature on a credit card. This is EXACTLY how things evolve. THINK PEOPLE. Don't just keep regurgitating the same ol shit because you see shifts in the coin price. Look at the big picture and smarten the f up.

@_date: 2018-08-08 17:48:22
Fact is, most people don't know a great deal about finances and economics. That huge run up in December was a combination of all variations of average Joe's and their gardeners and big players.
People who didn't know bitcoin from a turnip were jumping on coinbase and buying anything from $50 worth to mortgaging their homes. It was pure hype driven inflated value that couldn't possibly be sustained. What we need is that same volume of investment plus much more, but based on confidence, easy onboarding, mass usage and global infrastructure. A quick scan of the global efforts underway and it appears this is coming down the pipe and throughout the next decade we will likely see it unfold. Until then all we have is radical opinions, people diving into the weeds of topics like how an ETF will function, conspiracy theories, and FUD. Bitcoin may be a different beast, but it is evolving very much like early companies like Amazon, early stages of innovations like e-commerce and the early stages of dot com business we have seen in the past. The only thing that will bring this to where many of us want it to be is time.

@_date: 2018-08-01 03:12:34
Yeah, there's still a great chance that the CBOE ETF will be approved. Basically the SEC want to see some kind of insurance to protect market participants. The CBOE can offer this. If you offer insurance, more people will invest with peace of mind, and that volume will generate a great return on the investment of insurance for the CBOE... making everyone on both sides happy. If this is approved, then buying BTC at this price will pay off greatly sooner than later. If its not, well it's just a delay not a full stop.

A bitcoin currently is $6500, and if you are serious about your feelings towards  the future of this market then you put your money where your mouth is, otherwise you stand to risk nothing.

There's a lot of opinions out there. I'm thinking that first, crypto will co-exist with FIAT as an alternative decentralized currency, fixed supply, accounted for by math, no middle man, less room for error, etc. Eventually it will prove to be superior to fiat. But this is going to take time, and the early stages of wild west manipulation, volatility, and trial and error are an inevitable stepping stone to get where we need to be.

Hmmm, it's difficult not to sound condescending when talking to you, but honestly, you seem a bit out of the loop with regards to recent developments in the crypto space. There's a great deal of progress being made, both with framework &amp; code and with partnerships among industry giants. Before you publicly cite your opinion, at least do a little research so as to make that opinion an informed one. As an example, you mentioned bitcoin being an old tech... but it's that very fact, with its proven network  stability, that makes it a worthwhile investment of the time and effort that coders are contributing to improve its ability to accommodate higher volume, faster transactions, and user friendly interfaces for acquiring. 
You need a test period of actual use to become worth improving. Not some project that is no more than a white paper concept.
The internet was not replaced, it was scaled. That's how it works.

@_date: 2018-08-24 11:31:28
Well, I suppose perception is reality. Just remember fiat was already used for Starbucks, or wherever. Bitcoin is being accommodated because these companies want to be proactive. Fiat is not just the usd, it's all currencies around the globe, but Bitcoin can function as one global currency that can be accepted anywhere, and converted to any fiat. That alone solves numerous issues.
Why do you think Cash App has become huge, and having Jo Rogan push it on his Pod Casts? 
This is how all tech evolves and grows in adoption. I'm not even sure why you are debating it. Why does it bother you to the point that you would deny what is happening with slow steps toward adoption? It's still going to take years.

Look, you bought Bitcoin at the worst possible time out of a ten year period. You're not alone. If you wait it out there's a strong chance you'll regain your losses because this is still a very young market. 
But if a door opens and closes, and you walk into it while closed and break your nose... that doesn't mean you should waste hours of your time trying to preach to others that the doorway is a bad way to get to the other side. Maybe use the lesson you learned to make better decisions in the future. Or even advise others to invest at a more opportune entry point. At least that would be a decent use of your time.

Most of the info in here is based on BS and price junk talk. I'm not sure why so many people are oblivious to the fact, or what it means, but the physically delivered ICE Bitcoin futures coming in November is going to hit like a shock wave once people clue in. The Bitcoin will be purchased, and taken from the existing supply, then stored in ICE’s regulated Digital Asset Warehouse. Add to that the fact that the trading, which will be on their electronic trading platform, will be regulated by the CFTC.
If you don't understand why this is HUGE, here's the thing: The current Futures contracts are not using actual Bitcoin, they just wager on the future price of Bitcoin. So no Bitcoin investment is made and thus no impact on the price other than the unproven theories of manipulation being carried out by some assholes with no life and too much monetary power for their tiny brains to use productively. This new ICE Futures will actually BUY BITCOIN ..meaning price increase. It could be the start of an incredible bull run. They have openly admitted that they've been working on this on the down low, so as to not create too much hype too soon... and to have a tasty entry point to stockpile BTC.
Anyway, hopefully anyone invested enough to be in here already knows this, but in case you did not ... forget about the bullshit and trivial day to day price, and the trivial shorting on a few hundred dollars, and focus on the big prize. ACCUMULATE.

Of course man, it's the only way to win at this game. Every time Bitcoin goes below 6k, buy the shit out of it within the means of what you can afford to lose. Of course it's risky, otherwise everyone would do it and we'd already be over 50k per coin. 
That's the point buy it during the risk period and the reward may be phenomenal. Because once the price catches up with the framework efforts currently underway, it will be all worth it.
All this BS controversy, yet so few people stop to grasp the opportunity of it. I'd there weren't pessimists and one dimensional perspectives, then there would be no fear of buying it. But because of that fear, it takes balls to buy and risk your hard earned money. But then one day the few risk takers have the last laugh ...and should be thanking all those FUD spreaders for the opportunity they provided us.

First I'd suggest learning about Bitcoin, the current growth in development, and why that growth is continuing upward while the coin price for years, always seems to lag behind the growth of infrastructure. If you can understand why Bitcoin as an investment does not always line up with what's going in with efforts to make it easier to acquire and store, then you will have enough understanding to make a sound decision on whether or not you want to buy it. Because along the way of researching the above, you will learn a great deal about it as a currency, store of value, and as an investment, and what it has to offer as a hybrid decentralized entity in all three verticals.
I am a part of a group of friends and online acquaintances, who are long time investors in Bitcoin,  and by collaborating with these gentlemen I still learn something new every day. So don't worry about knowing it all, just get an overall knowledge.
If you decide to buy in, learn the options to purchase and store it safely. This is critical.
If you'd like some personal insight, I can tell you that some of these guys have been buying Bitcoin for over 6 years, and with the exception of coins bought since January, they have never lost on their investment. Nobody can possibly predict the future, but I can tell you that not one of us is worried about this year's price decrease. We saw it drop 90% once and still gained everything back in less than a year. Bitcoin is a wild ride but the overall projectory is up, so long as you have the stomach for the rollercoaster ride... because it has never moved straight up. The bubble last year was a bad entry point and the peak of the hype cycle. All innovative tech experiences this, but you're in luck because we're past it.

Then what exactly is it that you 'are' debating? All you did then was summarize the buying cycle and a typical business funnel. 
Yes, people make efforts to create profit. And incentive is absolutely required to generate progress, whether it be profit or a clean bill of health. But the only point of all this that matters is that nobody would be looking for any piece of any pie, or paying Rogan to promote anything as a part of their marketing strategy if there was no demand for it. So the developments you see materializing here and there are sure indicators that crypto is slowly integrating with society. I do agree with you though, I am smarter than that.

This recent quote from Ryan Radloff sums it up in simple to understand terminology, and a lot of the naysayers in here will appreciate the simplicity so they too can grasp it:
"New attraction, from new masses, will drive new demand; and this increasing demand will be filled through access points created on the back of the last cycle. The more people who want to play in the sandbox, the bigger the sandbox (and more sand) you need."

Great job. It's rare to find people who open their mind enough to see the potential of what Bitcoin will bring to the table. 
So many comments in here are based solely on a limited understanding of only one small piece of the puzzle like ETF details, why it can't work as a payment right now, its use for criminal activity, etc. Understanding the potential and the timeline involved to disrupt something as tangled into society as a monetary system is key to understanding the future value of Bitcoin.

Well you're entitled to your opinion, and I respect that. I have also spent a lot of time researching tether and discussing this in detail with people pretty deep in the weed of all this, because I too was very concerned. 
I'm pretty sure I understand the supply and demand issue of tether, and it's really common sense why they issue more to meet that demand.
Either way we shall see what CFTC has to say in the end, because the one thing I can tell you with 100% certainty is that neither you nor I can possibly know more than the many bright minds involved in this whole thing. 
You really should not talk like you alone have figured this out while so may are trying to verify the token with real investigative procedures.

Nice work. Just because everyone assumes that Bitcoin will be a huge part of finances for the upcoming generation there's no need to assume that older generations can't embrace it as well. I started my tech career an a college instructor years ago and onboarding the parents of my students in the evenings was an incentive we offered. 
Back then, teaching simple concepts of coding and computing to parents was an accomplishment because tech was not mainstream to their generation.

No this is not accurate. When there is demand for more USDT than exchanges have, those exchanges then pay Tether real dollars for USDT tokens. 
Your confused by the fact that the only thing that exists is cryptos and a MySQL database accounting liabilities amounting to billions in USDT.
All that money that exited alts and even Bitcoin ...where do you think it went? It went into tether and when that kind of demand occurs, exchanges need to acquire more tether. That's why they create more.
The fact that tether continues to print more tokens while CFTC is investigating them should give you at least some confidence.
@_date: 2018-08-19 22:54:29
Shhhh, let him think he just figured out something new. The tether conspiracy theorists don't get out a lot and they really believe that crap. They somehow missed the massive demand placed on thether when alts drained out and exchanges needed more tether. There are still people thinking it's printed to prop up BTC, because they heard some jackass say it on here lolololol.
@_date: 2018-08-08 12:19:52
Well to be realistic, we'd be overestimating the influence of whales to think they bring it down. It was overinflated due to the typical hype cycle most all innovative technologies see at the initial stage of growth. Nobody, whales included can retain any influence over that kind of volume. But that could not be sustained. Now days, it's simply a matter of a huge percentage of traders trying to cash out on every micromoment, and anticipating that each other will do the same. This too, is simply another stage we must endure. It's the stage of greedy fools trying to capitalize on every turn. In exchange for this, they give up their lives, and a part of their sanity. So in the end, nothing makes more sense than holding a new technology.

Sorry that was kind of brief hey ha. I agree with just about everything you said, other than the retailer investors being terrified part.

@_date: 2018-08-08 17:09:42
That's just about the easiest question ever asked on here. The answer is wait patiently until the price catches up with the growing framework efforts and it becomes easy to purchase, confident to hold, and the 5% of investors grow by the 20% that studies have shown to be waiting. Then another 20%, and eventually the last 55%. Manipulation does not thrive in high volume spaces.
In short? Give it 5 years or so ..AT LEAST. That's from an investment perspective. Theres also the currency and store of value side of things but that will require a little more time.

Isn't the point of all this, that we buy bitcoin now because of what consumer X will be doing once the potential is integrated with society? I mean already we see the hedge potential and we see developments in the works for improving the software itself. The fact that these discussions were already had a year ago, and it was repeadly pointed out by mutiple developers and advocates that this will all take decades should have made that clear to anyone following the going ons of this space.

I don't much care about pumps, they really only matter if you are actively trading on them because they ultimately lead to dumps. On that topic, it's worth noting that the recent dump action in Bitcoin has been 1-2% of the price...compare to 10-15% dumps that we saw in peak bear market. 
The weekend dumps barely even affect the price anymore and are immediately followed by a high volume of small buys scooping up the small discount. If things continue this way, it would be safe to assume we are well on our way to a bull market, hopefully with slow organic growth over the next year and beyond. 
@_date: 2019-03-23 20:15:48

Fidelity confirms that hundreds of institutions are Interested in crypto investments. It is important to analyze history, and understand how tech embeds with society. The entire process takes 30 years or so to complete and never really stops evolving. 
The takeaway... once bitcoin regulation becomes clearer, there may be a steady northward movement in bitcoin price for decades, and we may only have another year or so to really accumulate at these prices. The opportunity for payoff may be the biggest one of this century, so very unlikely to every come along again in our lifetimes. Food for thought!

I'm sure Starbucks won't pay a typical fee to Bakkt, because as mentioned, it's a partnership. Whatever amount of bitcoin is worth the dollar amount of the purchase at that moment in time would be exchanged by the software. There's nothing to analyze here, it's pretty simple. Bakkt will be dealing in bitcoin so they are promoting their agenda, and Starbucks get additional publicity as they become early participants in a shift toward cryptocurrencies.
@_date: 2019-03-29 14:07:47
That's exactly what they do. They sell it when they've made a heftty profit rather than risk missing the best exit point. You must realize that when bitcoin hit 20k it then dropped like a stone. That's because although investors would prefer to sell small amounts at a time and continue to ride it up, they are worried that not all others will do same. Thus, that perspective is shared across the board and mass selling occurs to catch what is perceived as the safest profit taking point. Sometimes they buy back in at a lower price, but who knows. This works over time because it creates greater distribution. The entire process takes generations, and large amounts of wealth and power in the hands of a small percentage of people has been the status quo throughout history.

I don't own enough to become a millionaire  but by holding on to it now, I'll turn a profit. It's cheaper to acquire now then it will be once  the tech evolves and mass use is underway. Not sure what you mean about not having to do any work... that makes no sense. I work for the money used to buy bitcoin, same as I work for the money I use to buy stocks and all investments. I hope all of these increase in value, including bitcoin. I realize Bitcoin's value is not determined in the same way as a stock's value, but holding on to either in hopes that this value will increase is the same concept. It's silly to still stereotype people who invest in crypto that way.
@_date: 2019-03-14 15:19:08

Hmmm, the fact that there are still people who,  like yourself, believe that current systems are so rigid that a new type of economy cannot materialize over time means that the overhead for bitcoin's growth potential is even bigger than many realize.

Sound argument. And I agree that money is most definitely a communication medium. Bitcoin will accomplish the goal of aligning money with today's digital society because it is in a sense becoming money as streaming content. It will change everything. That being said, I too am in communications..well network security and operations, digital advertising, and more. I grew up without internet and I am aware of the time it takes for infrastructure to be implemented. I remember when swiping a credit card with a huge contraption was inconvenient at best. It created a carbon copy.. and took time. Infrastructure and end user tech for bitcoin, online apps, ecommerce etc will take a long time to integrate with society, especially since much of it is not created yet. But I am pro bitcoin and believe it is the future. First, I see it succeeding as a value store, and yes its price in USD can easily go 20X -50X by 2030.

@_date: 2019-03-07 16:03:13
I would look at the last decade to get a much more accurate perspective of where this is headed. At least the last 5 years anyway. Remember there was a hugh spike in price in 2017, so naturally there was an equally huge pull back to correct. The trend is still upwards with many many years to grow.

@_date: 2019-03-29 11:19:17
First of all, the fact that bitcoin has dropped 85% several times now over the years indicates that many of the larger holdings have been sold. Then you need to realize that minus a few exceptions, most of these whales you refer to represent multiple investors and traders, not individuals. 
Next, understand that this hapoens all the time - think about all the bitcoin that were acquired at ground level years ago and were sold at 15-20k. Or the marijuana stocks that were bought for a tiny fraction lf what they were sold at by huge players. Yet, the world still spins as per usual. Go figure right?
Lastly, do you really think that the groups that hold between 10,000 and 20,000 BTC would wait for a 100k price to sell? Why would they hold that long when the profits would be so tempting long before that price?? Which is why 20k didn't hold long in 2017, and why stocks all move in a wave pattern on their way up. In any case, there's nothing to worry about regarding your concern. Millionaires and billionaires are made all the time, and on even more outlandish terms than holding a large amount of BTC.

That's just the age old debate of Bitcoin versus stocks. I've spent many years investing in rental properties and stocks before I got involved in Bitcoin, and I too struggled at first with the concept of crypto value. However, once I researched, spoke with miners and traders, read and listened to the perspective of developers etc., I gained an entirely new appreciation for bitcoin and now realize that as a hybrid entity of currency and value store, it does not need to produce earnings or pay dividends like a stock because, well, it's not a stock!
Unlike a stock which represents value, Bitcoin, with its limited supply and blockchain ledger IS the value. Its potential as an alternative currency, value store and investment is off the charts and even in these extremely early days, that potential is not hard to identify. To not have owned at least "some" bitcoin at this low buy in will in my humble opinion, be a regret that millions of people will have within the next decade.

I want to relate to your perspective here, but I just can't label and categorize technology evolving into a neat and tidy list like you seem to need. For me, that just isn't how I have seen things work. This was a tiny project, with no more than a handful of participants and a few thousand dollars worth of equipment ...just a DECADE ago. Governments mocked it, now governments all over the planet are in a race to emulate it... again, just a DECADE later. How does that not give you enough to go on?
So, no I most definitely do not require a black and white definition of how Bitcoin will land exactly or in what square on the grid it will settle. For me, that's always been half of the excitement around emerging technologies. I need to again reference the internet. Everyone speculated on what use the internet and its underlying TCP protocol would bring to the world, but nobody knew. It was a sluggish alternative to doing things we already did efficiently (so we thought at the time), because we had generations to polish the current processes at the time.
Nobody knew that cloud storage, streaming media and services for media consumption, SharePoint, Salesforce, Google Docs, online shopping, Machine learning, digital advertising were just going to revolutionize the way we would do so many thing within just another 20 years. But we knew there was 'something' there with this internet thing.
In the past short decade, thousands of jobs and revenue have been a product of the surrounding infrastructure space. I'm referring to mining operations, chip set and hardware manufacturing for mining technology, countless employees of exchanges and platforms for investment, hardware and software manufacturers of cold storage wallets such as Ledger Nano or Trezor, thousands of content creators on digital learning around bitcoin on countless social media channels, and even university courses, authors of books, programmers, third part app creators, and that's just off the top of my head. That's how I can say it's catching on faster than other technologies I've observed in the past. Like the internet, many of us know there's 'something' there with this Bitcoin thing.
@_date: 2019-03-16 16:31:47
Well first of all I like working, long as it's on my own projects. I can't imagine not having a goal or purpose. Not working is not equivalent to financial freedom. 
Secondly, I have been buying bitcoin (and sometimes selling it) for years. But never once did I buy it as a shortcut to financial freedom. I buy it along with real estate, stocks and other investments. I consider it a high risk category because of its nature as an investment based on unchartered territory, but also am well aware of its high likelyhood to eventually be worth many times what it is today. After seeing the obstacles it has already overcome, I am confident that development will continue and easily recognizable advantages of using and owning bitcoin will drive adoption in the years to come. 
Including bitcoin among a diverse investment strategy is wise in my opinion. Depending on it for financial freedom however, is naive.

There are many variables to consider in the event of a global financial crisis. But if Bitcoin was widely percieved as a strong hedge then it would help Bitcoin and crypto in general.
@_date: 2019-03-31 13:15:24
You don't seem to acknowledge that people holding are well aware that this holding concept is not what will drive Bitcoin's price or adoption. The goal is to own some now at a low price, and if possible, forget about it making a profit for you any time soon. There's a massive amount of change that needs to take place as younger generations take over global wealth, as the concept of cryptocurrencies becomes more mainstream, and as the processes and interfaces to use bitcoin become user friendly. I'm good for at aleast a decade before I'd even begin to evaluate progress. My point is that the majority wil not hold bitcoin, it just appears this way in early days as the use case is still extremely immature. As of right now the biggest use case is the speculative market, and that will hold us over until the next phase materializes. There are lots of ways to grow your money, and if you've got some to take a risk with, a bet on Bitcoin's future could be lucrative. Don't overanalyze the whole thing, just have some fun.  All coins won't even be mined until long after we're all dead in 2040. The holding of crypto nowadays won't hinder it's development or progress in any way.

Don't be a gullible sheep. Sure demand is low, but it's increasing not diminishing. The reason I said the article is shit is that they tried to link low demand to why the current price dropped. What about a few months backs when it spiked? What about the hundreds of times the price dropped before over just the past 4 or 5 years only to come back stronger? This drop is just normal Bitcoin price movement, and if you're new then perhaps you don't realize that.
Perhaps you believe that Bitcoin should be further along than it is because you read it in some click bait article, but this is a new asset class, and disruptive technology. This is not just some new form of payment system like Apple Pay, using the same old currency we've had for years. This is a new currency, a new protocol and network...along with being a new asset. 
This is gonna take generations and anyone that implies it should be further along than it is are full of shit. In fact Bitcoin has overcome incredible odds on just the last short decade already. That's why it's a shit article.

Bitcoin is nothing like the first search engine, first social network, etc. These things ran on the internet and would be equivalent to third party infrastructure integrating with Bitcoin,  which IS the network.

It has come a long way in 10 short years. When more people want to buy more bitcoin the price will reflect that demand. It will happen because there's no logical reason for bitcoin to stop maturing to a point where it evolves to provide obvious benefits to the user/owner. Next year, in 5 years, whenever. What you seem to want is another hype driven speculative bubble. That's useless.

Nobody knows any of this, but as long as the space continues to mature, the rise in bitcoin price seems inevitable. Double what it is now? Pfffft, that's just chump change compared to where this is headed.
@_date: 2019-11-08 21:10:59
Really? When I look at the past 5 years and the next 5 years ... it looks amazing.
@_date: 2019-11-04 22:21:34
Hey, if I could jump in here, the kind of thing with regards to the price rising,  has been happening for years. It isn't something that just stops, although the early day opportunities to buy bitcoin for a few dollars are gone forever. Could Bitcoin implode? Anything is possible, but to say it could just as easily implode as it could go higher would be not be accurate. With every day that bitcoin is still around, and with all the investing in third party infrastructure, the more likely that bitcoin is here to stay for the long haul.
@_date: 2019-11-21 01:28:30
I was just razzing you, about the selling bridges thing, you know as you implied that people are gullible. I obviously have no idea how smart you or anyone else in here is. But Bitcoin has been around a long time now, and make no mistake there are a lot more than gullible people invested in this space. I've tried my hand in many investments over the years, and rarely does something with Bitcoin's potential come along. There is a lot of speculation in these still early days, but the risk in exchange for reward is immense.
@_date: 2019-03-21 15:39:07
I get neither excited or discouraged. I simply buy bitcoin whenever have an extra few hundred to drop on it and will continue to for the foreseeable future. These micromoments in price mean nothing.
@_date: 2019-03-03 06:36:19
I never said that exactly, but it is kind of accurate. With regards to where BTC and cryptocurrency are headed in the future this would be the beginning. It is also interesting to consider the odds bitcoin has already overcome.
@_date: 2019-11-14 00:51:57
Are you just looking at the price? Because there's no end to the developments happening in the surrounding space, and it just keeps growing, and growing, and growing ..... 
Even if you do just look at price, there's a pretty clear trend over the years. I remember looking at just the price too, and then I realized that there's an entire ecosystem around all this stuff. Remove the few short periods where the price spiked, and it's basically been increasing for over a decade.
@_date: 2019-11-08 19:22:47

Governments want their own digital currency and it's looking inevitable that this will happen. In all likelihood, they will want to keep people in that digital ecosystem and guess what digital gold is? Bitcoin of course!
Government have absolutely no issue with speculative store of value macro assets. No issue at all. Those who invest in Bitcoin within the first few decades will obviously make the most return, and the insanely large returns clearly having already been made during the first couple of years.
While this rules out, or at least delays, Bitcoin being used as a mainstream currency for daily transactions of goods and services, it strengthens the "Bitcoin as an asset" use case by large margins. Most people will remain afraid to invest in the risk of the unknown and the "out of their comfort zone" asset during the first few decades. But the government doesn't care about the handful of us that actually make tremendous gains in these early days. Limited supply still means Bitcoin has to increase dramatically in this scenario based on simple math. So the choice is clear... take advantage of this shift in financial landscape that is clearly taking place, or look back with regret once the opportunity has passed.
@_date: 2019-11-11 13:28:19
Yes. Bitcoin is the network, the foundation upon which many other layers, technologies and business models will be built. Like the CompuServe comparison, some of these things may fail and be replaced, but like the internet, bitcoin will be built and expanded for years to come. It took over 10 years for bitcoin to prove itself worthy. Now we build. Bitcoin is protocol. Like TCP, you don't replace it, you build on it with layers and technologies.
@_date: 2019-11-11 17:10:30
Buy it ...and stop overcompensating with font large enough for 3 normal posts.
@_date: 2019-11-23 17:10:57
There's so much more that can be developed with the Bitcoin protocol, and now that it's had a decade of stability and proven to be an exceptionally secure protocol I think we're going to see development ramp up over the next decade. TCP was in a very similar position in the early days. It was slow and clunky, but the value was in its stability as a base layer protocol. Once it proved itself as such, that's when the building really started an now it runs the entire internet.
You mentioned the video game market, but the custody solutions that are just starting to pop up couldn't possibly be targeting video gamers who likely can't even afford a single whole BTC. Even if it was, those gamers will be the decision makers, politicians and main base of the next generation. It would not be a stretch to see them prefer a 24/7 accessible digital asset which aligns with the digital society they grew up in over gold and such. Replacing currency is not really where I see it, at least not in my lifetime. But all the countries that once mocked Bitcoin are now racing to emulate it for their own digital currency. And they will... but it will not be decentralized thus Bitcoin will always have its own niche for a global asset.

Of course but considering it's never just went down, that's never been a concern. It was pennies just a decade ago. That's pretty much the complete opposite of just going down. And now we're about to finally see trusted platforms offering onramps to purchase so the next decade is most likely to see far more upside again.
@_date: 2019-11-27 13:10:36
Bitcoin is a push, not a pull payment system. There are multiple other reasons why once the infrastructure is built, and enough people own Bitcoin, that it can easily succeed as a currency. But the push system along with offering a trustless decentralized ecosystem are the top reasons.

I wouldn't buy or sell based on anyone's suggestion, because even the most wealthy, tech savvy people I know have never been privy to that kind of info and many of them have been trading bitcoin for years. So why on earth would you have this inside knowledge?
@_date: 2019-11-15 22:51:50
Just DCA. Nothing is gaurenteed but Bitcoin has overcome FAR greater challenges than those it faces today. As a long term investment Bitcoin still holds strong, but without the risk and uncertainty along the way, these opportunities to buy and get gains wouldn't be around.
@_date: 2019-11-23 15:11:55
I agree with most of this. But the challenge of government and central bank trying to supress Bitcoin is one that have akways know we absolutely MUST go through before Bitcoin can fully thrive. I say lets get this stage over with and move on, because it could last for a very long time.
@_date: 2019-11-22 18:19:46
Don't feel bad kid. There are plenty of us here that are making a lot of money to offset the balance, and we're certainly not selling at a loss. Once you ride Bitcoin up and down for 4 or 5 years, you'll catch on. Stay strong little one!
@_date: 2019-03-31 20:20:52
If the electricity goes out on a scale that affects the entire globe,  I'd think we'd have far bigger worries on our hands. As for grocery stores, I guess seniors will be the only ones eating then, because who even carries cash anymore? Not to mention, bitcoin is nowhere near ready to be used main stream in grocery stores... if it were then the investment opportunity will have been passed. And by the time bitcoin is used at grocery stores (another 10 years or so), even fewer people would be carrying cash!
@_date: 2019-11-25 15:29:11
Bitcoin is growing, as an asset and as an ecosystem. It has been growing for years. If you don't see that because you've been distracted by the daily price swings you will almost certainly miss the big picture. Stop caring that it spiked to 20k for 5 minutes. It's the overall trend that matters with higher lows every year, and every fundamental that matters is improving.
@_date: 2019-11-22 14:40:00
Again? Haha...never heard that before old man.
@_date: 2019-11-12 02:57:34
The implications of Bitcoin dissapearing tomorrow would be mostly the loss of thousands of jobs and revenue in the surrounding infrastructure space. I'm referring to mining operations, chipset and hardware manufacturing for mining technology, countless employees of exchanges and platforms for investment, hardware and software manufacturers of cold storage wallets such as Ledger Nano or Trezor, thousands of content creators on digital learning around bitcoin on countless social media channels, and even university courses, authors of books, programmers, thrid part app creators, and that's just off the top of my head. 
In terms of future growth there's the same implications as there are if things like 3D printing, space travel to Mars, gene editing, and quantum computing dissapeared I suppose.
Lastly, bitcoin IS blockchain. Despite the sensationalized information floating around out there, the blockchain conversation would be mute if there was no Bitcoin. Since you seem very restricted to current state of development, to this date there is no other productive use of blockchain outside of Bitcoin. In fact, many experienced developers strongly believe that there will never be a better use of blockchain than Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-11-20 17:15:34
OP speaks facts. Bitcoin IS Blockchain. Explain to me how a centralized blockchain makes sense because nobody else has been able to and many smart developers have tried.
@_date: 2019-03-06 23:45:53
I'm not sure where you got the info, but Starbucks have an equity deal with Bakkt, which will function as a cryptocurrency payments platform.
Purchases will be made in-store using special software from Bakkt. This all about progress in extremely early days. These types of partnerships and developments help moving forward with applications for customers to convert their digital assets into US dollars, which can then be used in stores. The exchange you're talking about in your post...would be Bakkt.
@_date: 2019-11-21 15:49:17
Of course man. Bitcoin does this all the time. It's a good thing too, because if your goal is to accumulate bitcoin for what seems like a very high chance of a much higher price over the next 5 years or so, these drops are the time to average down.
@_date: 2019-11-23 14:06:02
Ha ha, yeah I read that piece of shit article last night too. Subjective writing presented as facts just to get views. That stuff is ridiculous.
@_date: 2019-03-30 15:17:15
The most likely scenario would be that people will sell in increments long before that,  just as it happens with stocks. For example It hits 10k and drops to 7k, hits 20k drops to 15k, hits 50k drops to 40k, etc. People wish they'd held Amazon over the years, but there's no shame in taking a profit, and few people know where the ultimate top price will be. We can safely assume that bitcoin will continue to rise in price just as it has gone from pennies to 4k over this past decade. Profit taking can be at any point, providing the investor feels it's worth cashing out. Maybe a person would prefer to enjoy or make use of a big profit now, rather than a bigger profit in 10 years time or whatever.
@_date: 2019-11-15 00:12:22

It has nothing to do with the price. Your saying that an organization as large as the New York Stock Exchange and ICE, who took a year to make sure they had everything in place, and abided by all the requirements, would lie to the world and all their customers and risk being sued via class action for false practice?? Risk their reputation over the smallest department in their enterprise? Think about it.

If you put money in Bitcoin, 5 years later it's a lot more money. Week to week, month to month fluctuations mean very little other than opportunities to grab more on dips. Like you said, the things that matter are growing every day. The better the roads are, the more likely people will drive on them. Patience.
@_date: 2019-11-20 12:57:01
There's always news, and there's always a development in the works. The Fidelity 
and bakkt news yesterday or whatever. 
But yeah, basically, bitcoin is not some privately ran company with a marketing department to push it out to the public with ads and promotional material. Yet as a decentralized entity, it still managed to grow from nothing to being positioned to become a global store of value asset. Impessive.

These things are not what is driving Bitcoin prices ... yet. Currency use is nowhere near ready on any large scale. You either invest or you don't. For those who do, a recession would mean a more serious look at Bitcoin and gold. Bitcoin was born in a recession.
But as I said, the people you are referring to are not driving price direction. For example, the price jumped a few hundred dollars in 15 minute - do you think those large moves in the green or the red that happen within minutes have anything to do with the people you mentioned above? Large players are moving into Bitcoin and things like Bakkt volume reflect that. If you invest then Bitcoin would look more attractive during a recession in my opinion. We'll never know until one hits!
@_date: 2019-11-12 16:39:01
Rightfully so. There's never been more reasons to be bullish on Bitcoin in the past decade then there are now.
@_date: 2019-11-21 16:46:00
I would have agreed with you up to a few years ago... there were a lot of moon boys. I see far more long term perspectives these days. TA for bitcoin is a joke. If they get it right it's pure luck. I might know one single trader who has more bitcoin now than when he started and that mostly from one big pump he lucked out on... and he'll be the first one to tell you, no TA on the planet saw it coming lol. TA requires long term trends to really bite into. Every market contains manipulation, but this market is still young and small and that means large players can impact price and trigger fomo in both directions. TA can't possibly predict a big red or green candle that appears out of nowhere, and anyone that says they can are full of shit. The players dropping millions on bitcoin can read the same TA, and they're sure as shit not gonna follow a pattern that all the so called TA experts call for. TA is fun, but DCA in bitcoin has made a lot more money than trading so long as you look at least at a 3 year+ time frame.
@_date: 2019-11-21 19:52:01
It requires infrastructure and time. Be patient. The last decade was required to build the foundation and the next decade will see onramps, trust, layers, third party infrastructure of all kinds.

Call it what you will. Everytime I've bought Bitcoin over the years, I'm basically betting on a future economy where it plays a big role. So far that bet has paid off multiple times. I like having a little risk portion in my investments, and after working in the IT industry for many years I'm pretty confident in my ability to recognize disrupting innovation. Bitcoin will be a very large part of the future economy.... that's a gamble I'll easily take.

Nobody knows, but if we hit bottom when we went down into the 6k range, then I suspect it's upward movement to the 10k range for a while.
@_date: 2019-11-22 14:39:09
It's called averaging down and is one the most common strategies of investment since the beginning of investing lol. You buy at intervals on the way down because you can't know the bottom, and then as soon as the price starts to recover you begin recovering too much sooner.
@_date: 2019-11-22 22:45:26
?? Lol, you need to read. We're talking about legit companies that are CURRENTLY invested in bitcoin. We're saying that if Bitcoin were a pyramid scheme (which is absurd if you know anything at all about the last 10 years), then companies like the NYSE, Fidelity, Square, Twitter, Starbucks, etc., would not be invested in growing the Bitcoin infrastructure. And there are FAR more high profile companies all over the world that are getting involved. But even without their involvement, as BitcoinAlways said above, the US government would not have revised their tax structure to collect taxes on a 'pyramid scheme' LOL. The SEC already publicly stated that Bitcoin is an alternative speculative value store. So there's really no room for debate here.

Very mature of you... and your sockpuppet account.
@_date: 2019-11-22 19:14:18
You're stuck in the limitations of your own thinking. Bitcoin is not a stock ....PERIOD. The speculative market is going to remain extremely volatile for a long time in this new emerging asset class. Traders buy low and sell high when they can, and that's that. There's probably more people making money in a bear market than in a bull market, and holders are looking at a 3-10 year long term outlook while this thing gets built. Try and grasp this... there is NO company having a bad earnings period or reduced cash flow, Bitcoin is a protocol for a new way of doing things that is barely out of the gate.
@_date: 2019-11-23 16:56:50
Yep, of course that's called industry. And the industry around Bitcoin has been growing faster than most realize.
@_date: 2018-10-23 17:35:18
You mean when you're the 'typical' CEO. Elon Musk is anything but, and many find that refreshing. If everyone settled for typical, we'd have no innovation. We'd have no Bitcoin.  If Musk was typical, there would be no Space X or any of the things he created.
I watched that entire Joe Rogan podcast, and for all the brilliant things that Musk communicated over a long podcast, the media focused on the one second that he held a joint and said he doesn't smoke marijuana because he finds that it interferes with his productivity. If you're easily swayed by media, then I have ice cream in the oven to sell you. It's tastes better that way.

It's difficult to believe that people can be so dense. If you own a coffee shop and you decide to also offer doughnuts, that does not mean you're switching to doughnuts, it means you're offering an alternative. 
Bakkt can offer cash setted contracts, and so they should, because they want people who buy them from CME to bring their business to Bakkt instead. It's still the same number of people out there buying cash settled, Bakkt are still offering their BTC physically settled, and all is well. How is that difficult to understand?
@_date: 2019-11-11 17:19:58
Really? So then the computer networks used all over the world to share data, transact, stream, secure, authenticate, etc., are of no value? Because they are not used in industrial applications all over the world? 
Also, Bitcoin is in its infancy. Should we have claimed the internet as useless before it was expanded and built? Cars as useless before the roads and infrastructure were built? Yes I accuse anyone of ignorance when their scope of perspective is so narrow.
@_date: 2019-11-19 17:23:34
Looking at yearly lows shows a very clear long term growth trend. Anyone who has held Bitcoin for at least 3 years and bought at regular intervals (as you should with any investment as opposed to making one mass purchase with a few exceptions such as real estate) is well in the green. If you can't hold for a least 3 years, then you don't benefit from having a little patience.
I prefer to look at yearly lows because they show the "Worst" case scenario and are far more realistic than highs, which usually only last for a day or 2.

Funny you say that. I realize you're semi joking, but a group I participate in holds regular discussions on crypto and that very topic came up recently. Basically, we all agreed that the most powerful companies on the planet would have crumbled under the negative media coverage thrown at Bitcoin over the years. I mean scandals, hacks, country wide bans, the whole lame 'no intrinsic value' claims, Warren Buffet's opinions, claims of criminal use, and the list goes on. Yet, here is Bitcoin continuously growing insanely larger in both price and infrastructure over the past years. As a network, it continues to grow and expand, like the root system of a tree, the roads of a growing city etc. RESISTANCE IS FUTILE!! ha ha.
@_date: 2019-11-15 03:51:09
 I haven't researched any metrics to name on 3D printing or self driving cars either, but I know they are quickly being written along side of Bitcoin into the future. My perspective as you describe it inside the bubble is actually a vantage point from my experience. The majority become fully aware of these new technologies when they are knocking on their door. They rarely ask for them or seek them out. My perspective allows me a little extra insight on these thing before they mature.
Coming from you, your last post is about as positive as I'm gonna get. So I'll take it as we close this chapter of our debate. Good luck out there.

That theory has been debunked more times than I can count. It is a fun little piece of FUD and I see why people keep circulating it. The new Mining operation coming online in Texas is going to dwarf China mining anyway, and this is still only 10 years in. We're barely even off the ground.
@_date: 2019-11-10 13:00:48
I'd guess by October of 2020, the decreased supply should start impacting the price. But there's a lot more going on than the halving so we could see a rally based on increasing buyers, increasing bakkt volume, institutional investment, and a lot of overall positive news and developments. Within the next 5 years or so there should be some decent gains. 
Right now is the time to accumulate and to be thankful for the sideways action to do so. If you can't broaden your time line then you should find a different investment. The infrastructure is growing but this has to take years.
@_date: 2019-11-27 15:21:37
People rarely get behind forms of money in a conscious effort if you study the history. They get behind Bitcoin because of the independance it offers, but this is a very small group of people. Any other project going forward will never be able to offer that because it will have some element of centralization. I don't worry at all about the distribution, that's just a by product of how early we are in Bitcoin's lifecycle. 
We may not like it, but there will always be early adopters and in the case of this new asset, early investors. What good is wealth if it's not spent eventually? In 50 years from now, if Bitcoin's layers and expanded protocol have survived, people won't be worried about distribution. 
And I'm sorry, but in my opinion we are looking at a long time before we can reach that kind of use. You don't change existing generations, you wait for future generations to adapt. For the foreseeable future, Bitcoin will be a speculative investment, a digital gold. The industry and investment around that use case is growing. I'm personally fine with that. It gives people an alternative, and it's a fun, fast moving asset to add to your risk portfolio. As each generation passes through it all, I can see more and more people gravitating to a digital asset to diversify, and catch a few gains on their investment. Either way the future should be interesting to watch in this space. I think by late 2021, we'll have a better idea of how demand for Bitcoin is looking.
@_date: 2019-03-11 14:39:07
All markets are subject to manipulation. The crypto space still has years to mature and due to lower volume than the stock market, large players have more impact. We are still in early days, and this will change as the market matures.

A kid on YouTube, LinkedIn Profiles, and Click bait Articles dissected is your evidence? BAH hahahaha. 
Look, Bakkt are not "Switching" to cash. They will offer options, they will offer custody for institutions (recently announced) and they "may" offer cash settled futures to stay competitive with CME. This is NOT "switching to cash", and you clearly worded it that way to generate the rumor mill.

No, no I do not live in a bubble. I have been an IT professional, a college professor, a business owner, a martial artist and a family man. To say that borders on an insult, but I am also not overly sensitive. Renewables? Again, and I'll say this over and over because you're not getting it... it's been ten years and there has never ever been anything like bitcoin before that. Even the USD derived from gold which had thousands of years to position. I'm telling you from my perspective, and I am confident that it is a credible one, what Bitcoin has accomplished in a decade is highly impressive. If it dissapeared tomorrow my life would not be effected. So I have nothing at stake here aside from a tiny percent of risk portfolio and one of my interests. I have no reason to debate you other than to help me learn about the opposing opinions, and because I appreciate your stance. But please don't assume I life in a bubble... that derails the entire exchange. Remember, the possibilites of what Bitcoin can become are even of greater interest to me than the launchbpad of the past decade. That's why I'm here.

To be fair, this has been the sentiment at all lower ranges, and sometimes like at 3k range it's correct, and other times like your reference, it's wrong.

Well considering how early we are in terms of bitcoin evolving, and considering only 8% of Americans and only 0.31 percent of the total population own bitcoin yet... you are wrong. The fair price of a global currency and record keeper maintained by perfect math &amp; blockchain security/redundancy is beyond what most of us even imagine. The time it will take to arrive at that price however, will likely extend beyond our lifetimes.

@_date: 2019-11-22 19:06:47
That's 100% wrong. Do the math. Even if you only started buying in Dec 2017, if you bought just $20 a day since then, you'd be up approximately 25%. Most people would use at least a 3 year sample time for any investment (in which case you'd be up FAR more), but to address your point I just used the time frame you referenced in your OP.
And don't tell me you only bought once during the ATH, because even in stocks you don't buy just once. you buy regularly like any investment unless you're trading.
@_date: 2019-11-22 05:20:32
Yes it was ramping up to its ath, so my point is clearly....it needs a few years to consolidate from a 20X gain. I'm just addressing your concern of why it's not higher yet. We've been through this before. And stocks go through it too, but Bitcoin's infrastructure is still being built, more ever day.

Naw. The average yearly low has been going up year over year. Just cause Bitcoin hit 20k for 5 minutes doesn't change that. The overall trend is up and it's clear as day.
@_date: 2019-11-20 22:39:34
"when it drops lower" ... that's your first mistake. Never assume anything with Bitcoin. It might go as low as 7k or it might ride up to a much higher price over the next few months. My only advice is NEVER believe anyone who tells you the price is going to go up or down for certain, because that immediately makes them completely full of shit.

I don't know who told you that but they were 100% wrong. Normally you look at a minimum of 3 years, but OK..let's look at two. In fact, let's start DCAing close to the ATH of the past decade and even then .... you'd be up 25%. Oh, and not sure what stocks you invest in, but I've tried many and even with dividends, there's not a lot of 25% returns. You are really over selling that info lol.  
Anyway, even you'd only started in the peak of 2017. Here is a very interesting post with some DCA math from [r/BitcoinMarkets](

Been like this for a very long time now, nothing new.  No harm at all in buying dips if your goal is to accumulate for 3-5 years away. This volatile action has become a walk in the park, and this time around is far from the worst we've seen.

So Canada approves a bitcoin fund that will be released on their stock exchange and purchasable in a TFSA, RRSP, and regular stock account in 2020. First pot and now Bitcoin. Seems to me Canada has a first mover thing going on. We also have bakkt's consumer app coming, and China's open arms to blockchain and even crypto with their recent educational videos that include Bitcoin. Can we safely just go ahead and say Bitcoin is the real deal and is here to stay as a fast growing part of future global finance?
@_date: 2019-11-21 19:58:34
There no source to that bullshit outside a few kids on youtube who monetize your views and traffic. I appreciate youtubers, but you have to DYOR too. Bakkt may offer cash settled contracts as an "alternative" and try to take some of the CME business but that's not what the OP is saying. What he is saying is unfounded, absurd and there is no source.

You're not thinking ahead. Imagine for example, if we had thought that ip addresses were too complicated to remember and we didn't progress to invent domain name translation services. That's just one example of course.

I don't have time to research the number of jobs created in the space, and no disrespect but I don't really care. I have my businesses, family and more personal interests than I can find the time for. What DOES matter to me though, is that there were no jobs in the Bitcoin space a decade ago, and now there are thousands. I know Coinbase and Binance alone employ over a thousand people, a few hundred more for Ledger and Trezor, about 1500 at Bitmain and we've barely scratched the surface.
Do you think you'd change your stance on anything if I did have the numbers? I don't, because your perspective is not about "hey look, wow this thing is growing off the charts in just 10 years!". You take the pessimistic road, and I respect that. I just see growth everywhere I turn these days, and I want to be a tiny part of it because I find it fascinating. Life is short, so find pleasure where you can and indulge in interests! If I observe another emerging tech that seems to outpace Bitcoin's growth, I'd be among the first to notice that too.
@_date: 2019-11-19 15:02:17
Been that way off and on for years along the way as Bitcoin climbed from hundreds to thousands. Considering all the spin off growth in the space with exchanges, developments, investment platforms and mining companies, etc., there's absolutely no logical reason to expect the long term growth to stop. I'm to the point where I'd be worried if it didn't fluctuate this way ha. Important to always have a little powder on hand to buy so you catch all price points.
@_date: 2018-10-03 23:12:41
Well, then I'd buy a large amount of bitcoin, as would a hell of a lot of people, rapidly lowering supply and increasing price. Nobody's selling at large numbers now because they're aware of the infrastructure growth and can see that it makes more sense to liquidate when more people are buying and the price is higher.
@_date: 2019-11-19 20:43:32
Not true. It was on an upward trend for the first half of this year. It was on an upward trend for more than half of the time for 8 years up until the end of 2017. So still...DCA for the win.

1 would be minimim but many people can't afford to spend that on a high risk. I see the hardest part being having the will power to hold on to it as it rises in value. The temptations to sell at 20k, 40k ...maybe 100k ...would be strong.

Be realistic. There are still people who are afraid to use their credit card online and it's been over 20 years. These things take a lot of time. I have worked in the tech space and IT networking space for years, and I can tell you that there is simply no way that Bitcoin could possibly be any further along than it is today. People need to build trust in it, which happens slowly the longer it exists without being compromised.
Also, people need easy to use interfaces and on ramps that are not necessarily tied to the negativity surrounding exchanges that have been hacked, using shady practices etc. Once the younger generation, raised in a digital society become the mainstream buyers, business owners, politicians, etc., we're going to see a big change in how society sees Bitcoin. So if you can't look ahead over the next decade, don't waste your time hoping to make a lot of money by holding BTC just yet.

@_date: 2019-11-13 16:02:43
What is even more relevant (regarding price) is that Bitcoin has only spent less than 3 months out of 11 years above 10k. When reading the charts long term, this matters more because most time spent above 10k was merely hype driven blips in the big picture. The long term trend has been, still is, and IMO will continue to be UP UP UP.

Because you want to enjoy the gains while you're still alive.

The growth, jobs, and everything I mentioned above is what catching on is. If you wait for Bitcoin to be defined by some specific use case, you're missing the point.

Small market, so big moves impact the price...as they logically should in a small market based on simple math. But it's incredibly obvious that the market is growing fast with so many new developments to invest in bitcoin as a new financial macro asset popping up and so many in the works. As the early adopters unload their massive amounts of Bitcoin and they are becoming more distributed among smaller investors, the ecosystem grows and eventually manipulation becomes less of an issue (but there will always be some manipulation in any market).
@_date: 2019-11-14 00:39:24
There is no other example that comes close in my opinion. Well, other than the last network to grow this way - the internet itself. I work in the tech industry and I observe. Bitcoin did not exist 11 years ago. Now it's grown to a global asset. Normally this takes generations, not a decade. I have always assumed by mid 2020's we'd see things like what we see now, but yet here we are. 
The NYSE owned bakkt platform alone should tell you all you need to know. These guys would never embarrass themselves on a world stage. They're too big to need a small fry operation. They just expanded the platform even further and clearly see the potential. 
There are countless video clips of very intelligent people during interviews in the 90's mocking the internet, saying it has no use. "We already have the telephone and fax machines they said". "If it has no use that we need, why would it ever take off?" they said. Even though it grew by huge proportions in just 30 years (which today would be more like 10-15 years) they just didn't get it. Sound familiar?

Every drop is a buying opportunity if you have a 3-5 year outlook. Ask anyone who has done this for any 3+ year period. If you're trading, well that's a whole other story. DCA for the win.

Nobody knows. Only a fool would pretend to know. You should only invest with what you are confortable with, and an amount thay won't stress you out if it goes down in the short term. The future of Bitcoin looks very strong, but currently investing in Bitcoin is a speculative bet on it becoming a mass adopted store of value. Many see Bitcoin serving a digital generation in the way gold has served as a traditional speculative store of value. 
If it continues on its path, Bitcoin could easily be worth many times more than it is today but this may take several years or more. Prepare to see the price climb and drop many times along the way. 
As for Bcash, I have little to comment on. I see it as an unnecessary project that divided and misled many people. It's nowhere near as secure as Bitcoin and has no reason to exist in imo.
@_date: 2019-11-15 17:33:19
Oh! Well then your reasoning is flawed, based on half the information and subjective. But thanks for the input. I said that seeing how bad another investment performed helps remind me of how much worse an investment "could" be.
I didn't didn't create bitcoin, and I didn't make it the best performing asset of the past decade ( up over 70,000x Over Past Decade), so where or how in the hell you fabricated the information that I gave myself a pat on the back, I have no idea.
Fact is a store of value is not something you judge on a week, month or year. There are plenty of investment vehicles for that. If you're "storing" your wealth one can usually assume it's for at least 5 or 10 years. So if you put your money away 10 years ago to spend it on something today - there's been no better performing asset to park your money in. That better?

Exactly, which is why I said early that this would require a slow, predictable and steady pace of deflation. I can't see that happening for a very long time. Considering the population, how much it's growing and how fast the percentage of the current population is moving into digital use... Bitcoin's measly 21 million coins would have to divided among billions of people. Thus, the value of Bitcoin would explode into highs not even imagined by the most outrageous predictions put forward. This is why IMO, Bitcoin is much more suited to a store of value, investment asset and alternative currency that can be used to make large transactions. One day sure, it may be a viable currency once the deflation slows, but I would think Litecoin or some other alt would be the currency medium that delivers value to and from the main bank of bitcoin value that any individual or organization owns.   
A digital currency economy is very likely to occur sooner than later, and Bitcoin has an enormous head start in terms of network proof of stability, security and accuracy. 
@_date: 2018-10-22 23:30:49
Yes exactly. It's called a hype cycle and has happened with all disruptive tech over the years.

Naw, I just think people are expecting it too early. And besides, how in the hell could we possibly know? What evidence would you be referring to exactly? Large companies can literally fire their CEO and he doesn't find out until the morning of. You really think that we here on Reddit would be in the know of their financial plans? Particular plans that would jack the price of something they would obviously benefit from the most at its lowest price. No disrespect but it always seems hilarious when people on this sub talk as though they know what's going on (not you). I simply meant that over the next year, many will be in for a rude awakening if they think Bitcoin is simply going to stop rising as it has been for a decade. Bad year? That's all part of the process.
@_date: 2019-11-21 16:22:25
Hmmm, interesting. So you read and believe without getting the full story I see. You also seem to generalize that we're all "moon boys" too hey?
I hold bitcoin as a risk portion of my portfolio. I know it's volatile, but I also know that it's aligned to become an excellent value store for a new generation born in a digital society. I'm more than aware of how long technology like this takes to reach mass use. Without the infrastructure, trust of the average user and ease of onboarding it simply can not be to that point yet. But gold is volatile, and speculative as well. 
If you think the younger generation raised in a digital world are going to prefer gold dug up from the ground over Bitcoin to store their wealth as a hedge, then you may want to look ahead a little and think again.
By the way I think Vechain is perhaps one of the best potential projects out there. It's not ready to roll out in full force and the price is pretty much completely speculated at this time, but if I were to bet on any use for blockchain outside of Bitcoin, then I would definitely go with supply chain/inventory, voting, logistics, decentralized exchanges, etc. Even then though, Bitcoin will remain the single best use for a blockchain simply due to the nature of its decentralization and functionality. It's not cost effective or productive for a company to slow down processes with a blockchain for no apparent benefit. Even the top blockchain developers agree, Bitcoin is hands down, the best use of blockchain to date.

Currently, we're all speculating of course. We don't know the future, but I believe it's fair to say we'll have a better idea in another 3-5 years. Right now the price is where it logically should be considering we needed a few years to consolidate after it going 20X its value in 2017. Now if it's still not higher in another few years or so after another halving, then perhaps we can assume bitcoin may not have the future that hodlers are counting on.
@_date: 2019-03-17 11:09:47
Wow, then you must own a lot of bitcoin you hope to profit on. Most people in these subs only have between 1 and 10 bitcoin, which is not enough to really make a huge difference in life at 20k per coin. So I hope it stays low so I can accumulate as much as possible at these low prices. I also hope the next run up is solid and not based only on speculation.
@_date: 2018-10-03 19:04:28
It's still largely unacknowledged, but at the same time coming more and more out of the shadows every day. That's why so many see it as an opportunity to be in this early. The friend that got me into all this used to mine and his enthusiasm for crypto was hard to ignore...plus he wouldn't shut up about it ha ha. Now I'm glad he did!  
@_date: 2019-11-22 04:55:55
The price 2 years ago was the all time high of its entire existance to date. If it didn't take a few years after that before it continued to climb then there would be something completely out of whack. 
That consolidation period is a must, just like a stock if ever went 20x in a year. It was the same way with the all time a few years before that, and the one before that, etc. 
I hear you man, no argument just conversation. Yes, Vanguard has a large variety to invest in, and I've tried a few of them over the years... good funds, decent dividends. Bitcoin is a long game and anyone with the patience to play it and a stomach for volatility has made out very well for themselves and the next decade is shaping up to be more intense and faster paced than the last.
Cycles for technology are very common, this one just happens to be growing like a giant compared to smaller localized innovations.

Well considering the number of people involved in crypto has been increasing since a small group of enthusiasts till now, with retail, governments and institutions involved, I'd say a very confident 'WAY MORE'.


YES, have you ever seen inflation not increase over 5 years since the debasing of currency?


YES, as the younger generation born in a digital society become the business owners, politicians, and target market buyers of the next generation, it would be very rational to assume they will push the use case of Bitcoin into the stratosphere. At the very least, they'll likely choose Bitcoin, which is in their digital realm, over gold dug up from the ground for their speculative store of value asset. That's common sense.

I don't care enough about it to feel as though if you ended up being correct that it would matter to me, but I do disagree. I have a boatload of more important responsibilities than my 5% of portfilio being bitcoin. I have been following it for 8 years because I work in the tech and networking space and love the potential Bitcoin brings. I don't however, love debating with strangers over whether some company that has a product I'll never be buying is legit in its mission statement.
@_date: 2019-11-14 05:31:04
I'll take it. Not only in Bitcoin, but in stocks, real estate, etc. Any investment that could give me a 50% return within a year is a damn good investment. (hint: Bitcoin has given a lot more than that over the past while).

Resetting is exactly that - clearing all data and wallets. You need to restore now, with the seed words from your initial setup. Don't panic, it works great. Just follow the instructions to restore on their website and use your previous seed words. All your crypto keys should show there then.

Bakkt can not be priced in, this is not a stock with some earnings projection. Bakkt impacts price because if it becomes active, and people start purchasing bitcoin via bakkt and/or any etf that doesn't run solely on derivitives, then the additional buying will drive the price up.
As far as ETf's or even bakkt for that matter, it's far more likely that anything 'priced in' would be negative since all ETF's thus far have been rejected.
Also... being approved would further legitimize bitcoin and have a positive impact on public sentiment. This can't be priced in like stock projections.
@_date: 2018-10-01 20:04:56
Smart man
@_date: 2018-10-25 10:49:01
There's no point in trying to explain this to you until you go and do a little more research on how bakkt will operate. I'll start though by saying they can't purchase from OTC..look that one up yourself please. Also, after multiple rejections of ETFs etc, most people have stopped expecting anything, which would mean it's more likely priced out!
Nobody who is still holding after the bear market year we've bad would sell because bakkt doesn't produce a price hike; they hold because of the massive growth occurring in this space from things like bakkt, that will eventually lead to demand levels that will drive price. I've invested in stocks long before crypto, and it seems to me that you are not acknowledging the difference between the two.
Furthermore, if these things actually take off, and this hits the public ...not the coin owner public, but general public who never heard of bakkt, the sentiment will shift. I know you say I'm ignorant but I've been invested in BTC for many years and am not offended at all...because I am very confident that I am not ignorant so it would take much more than petty insults from you to offend me :). Have a great day and remember- the smartest people are aware of just how much they have yet to learn.
@_date: 2019-11-08 21:37:21
Lol, when has the price movement of the next 3 to 3 weeks ever made a difference to anything in bitcoin if you're holding. Well.... with the exception of a few days we all remember about 2 years ago :).
@_date: 2019-11-21 17:01:48
First of all, I said 3 years, after all if you can't hold an investment at least 3 years I wouldn't bother with BTC. How did you know? You didn't. You got lucky. If you'd been wrong, you'd have not spoken of it lol.
DCA even for 2 years is profitable:
Here is a very interesting post with some DCA math from r/BitcoinMarkets:
@_date: 2018-10-03 18:27:30
Not technologies of this magnitude. You can't compare an iPad to something that competes with Fiat and Gold. This takes at least a few generations to really take hold. rest assured, a new generation that has been raised on technology and to trust digital security and encryption will very likely embrace digital currencies over gold dug up f the ground or fiat dollars. It just takes time. 
@_date: 2018-10-27 19:41:37
Cars don't have hoofs or eat grass. Streaming downloads don't have shiny discs. Email doesn't have an envelope and stamp.
Lol, I'm just playin. Look Bitcoin's network value is almost limitless. It's about accounting. Gold was chosen years ago, long before we evolved into a digital society and if you think future generations will choose something dug out of the ground only to bury it in a vault again and call a value placeholder over Bitcoin I think you're wrong. Bitcoin does a much better job of accounting and record keeping. You just don't see value because you are trying to compare it to value as it applies to older systems. 
If everyone thought that way no inovation would ever happen. We'd be stuck in the past forever. Ask any large corporation how much value they'd place in a secure, stable accurate network that has been running with 99.9% uptime for a decade. Anyone that doesn't see the value in Bitcoin is intentionally choosing to ignore it.
@_date: 2019-11-13 02:33:29
Too bad nobody told that to throw pillows right?? Seriously though, maybe the reason Bitcoin is catching on so much faster than other technologies in history could be the independance it offers. The whole peer to peer model has become more and more attractive since Napster days. Personally, it seems the 'digital gold' use case has been confirmed, and once enough people own Bitcoin, the currency use case can gain ground. That may take a long time though.
@_date: 2018-10-05 23:38:09

Naw, just bad for anyone hoping to cash out right now. It's not bad for Bitcoin because it does not depend on market price like a company with shares. Bitcoin's open source environment is going to continue getting developed regardless of market. The developers have said time and time again, they actually get a lot more work done during bear markets.

It took Bitcoin 11 years just to prove itself worthy of being secure, stable, expand its mining infrastructure, gain trust, and being a protocol worth building on. Now we build. Oh, and forget payments for the present - it's the use as a financial macro investment that will drive bitcoin into the future. Once enough people own Bitcoin, and once the infrastructure and protocol can accommodate the speed while maintaining the security (think layers like LN and sidechains) then we can move forward with payments.

Inside joke? Only thing I heard about Musk was a tweet that got some attention, but did you hear something else? 
I hate to be the bearer of bad news but the next big pump will probably take a lot more than a tweet. ETFs, bakkt and the halvening in 2020 will probably get the ball rolling for a great next few years. I'm long game lol.

Not a problem - an indicator of just how long things take. You just had to actually read my post :).


Seriously? Apple pay just uses the same currency that we've always used. It's just a payment onramp for an existing money system we've had for generations. Horrible example. Bitcoin is so new, it is barely past the start line.

Who ever told you that was on the juice. Price and interest are compounded into a fuel that drives volume. Ingredients include MSM hype, Infrastructure, partnerships, On-boarding tech, increase in user friendly interfaces, FOMO, ADOPTION, and much more. If you only think price follows interest or interest follows price you are wrong because they follow each other. Period. By the way .. who in the hell would think that today's little blip in the price would lead to 20K? Even if you only jumped in this game a few years ago, that's long enough to see it takes a lot more than a day of volatility to lead a bull run lol.

Stick around crypto for a few years and you'll realize how absurdly wrong you are about how quickly bitcoin can rise ..or drop for that matter, by a huge margin. Only a tiny fraction of potential participants were involved in that short lived spike. Now that BTC is way easier to acquire, anything is possible.
@_date: 2018-10-24 17:47:38

@_date: 2018-10-11 20:09:24
No I buy it when it's price is at the lowest I can get it silly man. You talk about the infrastructure of the house, well in that case you're WAY off track because Bitcoin's infrastructure is stronger than any point in it's history. Nobody can argue that fact, regardless of what the coin price does. There are forces far greater than you or I at work here. With several ETFs and bakkt coming down the pipe, you don't think they want a nice sexy entry point?? Don't be played. Just ride it out.

@_date: 2019-11-14 01:44:20
I did not insult you. Surely you are not that sensitive. This is an organization owned by the NYSE, arguably the largest exchange on the planet. You're honestly saying you believe either A. That these guys are going to mess around and risk embarrassing themselves and their reputation on the world stage, or B. That if they did want to hide something or operate in covert, that they wouldn't be able to hide it well enough to keep a Youtuber from uncovering their tracks? With the millions they have in resources to pull it off? 
It's a conspiracy...plain and simple. You just need common sense. Relax, and either buy some BTC or don't. I don't know you or that Youtuber, but I'm guessing neither of you have the money to be playing in bakkt's playground anyway so why get your pantys in a bunch over it? I mean he wants views, so I can see him putting in the work to create content, and sure it gets the conversation going. But there's no reason to get all personal about a theory. Your original post said it was a fact...it's not a fact. That's all I said.
@_date: 2019-11-24 20:32:18
Yeah but I thought it might be possible that more than one person out there would be naive enough to only buy once at the ATH and not buy lower lol!! Now that I think about it though, yeah I see it now.

A country doesn't think they should invest in a decentralized global currency.... shocker. No...no it doesn't say anything about Bitcoin other than the obvious. China doesn't want to invest in something it can't possibly control. That's pretty much how China have operated for a very long time.

So how many times is that now that the people too lazy to do any research have claimed that Bitcoin is dead? Certainly far fewer than back in the Mt Gox days, but it's mind blowing that there are still people  around that claim Bitcoin is dead just because it's market price dips. Education in this space is still lacking, but we'll get there!
@_date: 2018-10-26 05:19:08
Then we'd never evolve. The bitcoin to USD system would be the transition. The current money system was not designed for the digital age. What the future will look like ... nobody knows.
The world is bigger than the US and Bitcoin is global. It also removes the middleman because it maintains itself via accounting built into the blockchain.
@_date: 2019-11-29 05:11:18
Nobody knows man. The effect you're referring to applies to all spending across the board I suppose. The point is the people who already have plenty of wealth to park may very well turn to Bitcoin, depending on how much damage is being done to other investments and pegged values. The speculative attribute can be of great benefit in uncertain times. 
It also depends on how far along the surrounding infrastructure has been developed. The more user friendly the onramps to entry, the more demand and trust can ramp up. That kind of growth in a brand kind of asset class needs a little more time though.
@_date: 2018-10-18 21:08:42
There you go again. You're broken and that's your issue. But the first time I encountered you on Reddit you were insulting some guy, calling him stupid and telling him he was a moron. I told you that this was a disussion platform and you were being extremely rude. Ever since then you've been insulting me unnecessarily and it's time for you to grow up. Talk about Bitcoin not me. You want to bash people, do it to people you actually know... and to their face if you have the balls, which I seriously doubt.
@_date: 2018-10-15 13:56:55
If there one thing that's certain, it's that NOBODY knows for sure why these price spikes / drops occur. A lot of people like to jump on here and pretend they have answers, and even state them as facts. As if they get some form of validation by pretending they have the answers. Any exchange, whale etc with the power to move the price that much is a far greater force than anyone here on reddit. Best strategy? Smile and nod :)
@_date: 2019-03-29 15:03:21

It only seems like yesterday that the idea of half of what's being put in place today would have sounded impossible to me. It's like watching a baby grow lol.
Remember, most people are buying bitcoin as an investment, to trade or as a store of value. That will overshadow currency use for quite a while, which is just fine by me. One step at a time.

You give bakkt way too much credit. You should consider what I've been saying for months, which is that bakkt is a positive thing ..but I've always said it can't be priced in, so you're being premature with your claims. Why don't you remember things as they were said? A bad memory is not a good sign xelephonte, not a good sign at all.
That being said, I still feel exactly the same. Bakkt is one of many positive developments coming into the picture that I believe will add to the growing infrastructure. But the funny thing is that you talk about it a hell of a lot more than I do lol.

That's way too premature. If Bitcoin became a universal mainstream payment we would just simplify the units. We'd think in sats, 100 sats, 1000 sats, etc., with unit aliases. But children are not going to be learning to count in sats anytime soon. That's not something we'll have to worry about in our lifetimes... unless the infrastructure for ramps, payment systems, and layers speeds up by about 10 times what any other tech in history has ever done.

@_date: 2018-10-09 01:13:13
There's plenty of logic in what you say sure, and I also agree that the timeline needs to be realistic but not to get back to 20k. That could happen very easily. In fact the exact same thing has been said many times in the past with Bitcoin. It's actually dropped by 90% in the past and recovered to another new ath. And now we have incoming institutional money and far more framework to allow people to get in the game. 
You can't compare Bitcoin to company stock or even to gold when it comes to technical entry requirement. Up until very recently, bitcoin was fairly difficult to acquire if you were not technically competent. Soon you'll be able to buy it on the same familiar interface you've trusted all along for traditional investing. Surely you see the potential here, these facts are game changing.
@_date: 2018-10-27 21:54:54

Promises promises. Just another guy posting about another sale we'll probably never see.

Stop teasing.
@_date: 2019-11-13 18:17:06
Hey.. I am probably older than you!  I too have been through many ups and downs in this market, certainly the 2017 hype run and retail FOMO. I also have struggled through the 2008 recession. If looking at any data over time, I believe that the tiny time frames where anomalies occur should not be used as a measuring stick to evaluate progress. They do not represent the majority of time where the price moves reflect what is happening most often. The ATH of 20K is referred to far too often, mostly because it sets a goal post that can be used by bulls and bears alike to justify arguments made to support both perspectives. 
I prefer to simply view it this way: If you DCA, then you'd have bought FAR more often at a price below 10K than above it based on even a small 3 year investment period. Unless something drastically changes with the progress being made in the Bitcoin space (and the surrounding infrastructure seems to be growing faster than ever, so I doubt it will suddenly slow down), then it would be safe to assume that this can be said about a DCA strategy going forward as well. Patience wins in this space, and going all in at any one price point is not nearly as effective as DCA over a reasonable time frame such as 3 years+.

Yes, even the most experienced blockchain developers like Jimmy Song consistently say that the best use of Blockchain is Bitcoin hands down. It's disgusting how so many companies are trying to inflate their share prices by implying that they are implementing or working on blockchain.  one day who knows, but there will probably never be a better use case for blockchain than bitcoin for many reasons, the MAIN reason always being that if the blockchain is not decentralized then how does it add value?? Maybe for fraud detection of some sort, a voting system or inventory management.... maybe. For now though, Bitcoin IS Blockchain.

Sure. The younger and smaller a market is, the easier it is to manipulate. The Bitcoin market will mature, and clearly it has been maturing since just a decade ago there was no market, and now Bitcoin is considered a financial asset with even the biggest players on the planet like the NYSE owned bakkt getting into the game.
So yes, freedom to manipulate the market is all a part of taking the good with the bad. The market can't start huge, it has to grow over time. Eventually manipulation will be a non issue. Well... no more than it is in any other market.

When Roubini talks economy he sounds intelligent and is clearly an authority on the topic. When he talks blockchain, he sounds like a 5 yr old. His main criticism of ETH was that Vitalik failed to address POS and scaling. If those are the two topics under the spotlight, Vitalik can talk circles around Roubini because all Roubini does on this front is regurgitate the same old outdated claims, which he clearly does not understand.
Basically, the whole thing is stupid. Roubini is stepping into water that he does not know how to navigate. He's been wrong about crypto every year and now that this year is bear market, he all of a sudden has credibility to talk blockchain, scaling, POW v POS etc?? It's ridiculous. 
@_date: 2018-10-28 20:51:57
There's been a repeating cycle of ATHs followed by a lengthy bear market, each high and each bottom higher than the last. The hilarious part is that the trolls and naysayers think they're clever with their 'bitcoin is dead' yada yada BS comments. Meanwhile they just sounds like parrots who don't even have enough sense to see what's going on.

You talk a lot of shit and that's your business. But leave me out of your fantasy land please :).

Price can go up to an ath in 2 weeks. That's been proven and now that people have seen what there is to gain on such a gamble, there's no getting them to back away from the Roulette table now.
However... if we are talking about the price "staying" up? That's going to take some time, upgrades, adoption, and user friendly interfaces.

Nobody knows. From a technology perspective I'm convinced that it will be significantly sooner than that. From an investment persepective, things move even faster. I've witnessed some bizarre things happen in a very short time with crypto in the past. Much more involved people than you or I that I've crossed paths with in this space have been baffled. Assume as little as possible.

Well I think that most of us involved with crypto take it for granted just how much more comfortable we are with the tecnical requirement for entry, than the average joe who uses their bank's stock platform app to invest in traditional stocks.
That's one of the reasons that an onramp such as bakkt will open up the space to a vastly larger audience. We value the concept of maintaining control over our private keys, sure, but the majority of people still barely grasp the concept of blockchain and bitcoin. They want to add bitcoin to their hedge or high risk portion of investment but are not interested in cold storage or any of that side of things. 
So bakkt in my opinion helps to bring new money in bitcoin and since it's barely been only 10 years, the potential of where this is going and how it may be shaped is limited only by our imaginations.
@_date: 2018-10-20 13:51:01
First of all, who are you preaching to over and over with these long posts? Second, you don't know any of what you say to be true, you can't. The smartest people are aware of what they don't know.
BTC could be devastated if some detrimental vulnerability was uncovered by a hacker (highly unlikey), or it could soar well beyond all expectations if several ETFs and bakkt all kick in around same time and then FOMO kicks in. 
The sooner you accept that nobody has been able to accurately predict crypto prices or future scenarios the sooner you'll stop preaching and ride out the path this risky investment takes us on.

Perspective of the person speaking and the timeline referenced is everything. We might be down from a few months back but we're way up from Jan. We might be up from Jan, but we're way down from 2017.
It's all perspective. I choose the big picture...every 3 years Bitcoin price has been shooting up to reflect the huge strides in fundamentals. Now that the industry and on ramps around Bitcoin have been growing and are bigger than ever, it only makes sense that this continues. In fact, I suspect the next fast and furious move upwards within the next year or so will be bigger than anything we've seen to date.

There will always be an organization prepared to offer you wealth in exchange for a fee, whether it be interest or whatever. There's no reason why such an organization would have to be a bank. 
That being said, this is not something we'll have to be concerned about any time soon, if even in our lifetimes.
Bitcoin is getting positioned as a value store, a financial speculative asset. Digital gold. If it is ever to be more than that it will take a long time, as it requires additonal layers on its protocol to allow speed and privacy, while maintaining its amazing hardened security. Mortgages are nowhere on the radar in these very early days.

I've profited through 2 bubbles and less than 2% of potential investors have even gotten onboard yet. So my lack of cleverness was not recognizing the bubble in price soon enough last time. If you can count on anything, it's that there will NEVER be a shortage of people who simply can't resist a high risk investment. You laugh at institutional investment but they want ...no, they NEED high risk options for a small allocation. Now that the world has seen the last spike hit 20k, the next spike will be insane. But I'm not predicting it ..months,  years, who knows. Troll all you want, but don't dismiss the obvious greed that in itself would keep this space alive.
@_date: 2018-10-01 20:17:53
The only dive Bitcoin took was to come back on course to the path it was on after that 2017 end of year run up. I'm not sure how that involves people like cipher or anyone else in particular? There was a lot of hype fuel that drove it, but an end of year run up has become somewhat of a ritual! After those big spikes a correction is expected, but at least each correction settles at a higher low than the previous year.

Over the past 10 years, Bitcoin has performed exceptionally well. It is however, still a very high-risk investment. The thing is, high risk = high potential reward if you can stomach the severe spikes and drops. In your case, you seem to be looking at accumulating a little BTC here and there over time. If that's the case, and you're capable of ignoring the day to day change in price, then invest what you feel you can afford to risk and don't think short term. Ten years may seem like a long time, but in terms of such a new and wildly misunderstood technology as Bitcoin, it's barely getting off the ground. Good luck!

@_date: 2018-10-01 00:57:28

@_date: 2018-10-01 23:42:32
There's absolutely no reason to assume anyone is an idiot for purchasing Bitcoin. In fact, the maturity of participants are actually quite tech savvy and smart.
The fact that it spiked to almost 20k is more reason than ever to expect more people to jump in. Sure, it drops after each spike but if you can liquidate in time..which you can now do WAY easier than ever before, you can make some hefty profits. Now, consider that after each drop the bottom rises.
If you honestly believe that speculation is the only thing that adds value to Bitcoin you should play around in traditional stocks. A great many established companies are extremely overvalued, by as much as 3 and 400%. Every dollar over what the company is considered to be "worth" based on earnings, projected earning etc.,  is a risk no less than a dollar in crypto.
Now, open your mind to realize network value. Forget the concept of a stock, and consider the concept of a global ledger that stores a record of worth and transaction that is accurate beyond any other record keeper on the planet, maintained by math, encryption and high scale redundancy.
..Removing human error with NO need to pay employees to maintain it!! "No intrinsic value" my ass. Wait until the next generation comes online, a generation raised to trust digital storage and encryption.
@_date: 2018-10-26 16:40:19
Well then we've gone full circle. After all the things discussed you've extrapolated the data and come to the conclusion that BTC is a dinosaur which from an IT perspective is hard for me to even understand. I work with tech day in day out, and I have no idea where you would get this idea. No other cryptocurrency even has a foot out the door and Bitcoin already has the foundation that is required to start building and layering upon. Bitcoin also has 100X potential of any currency limited to a single region and it's cross platform/cross geo-transaction abilities trump anything in existence to date.
@_date: 2019-03-28 21:21:50

There's no such thing as a guaranteed price increase, common man. This is the second time you've accused me of this and I've never said it. The post you are referring is back when I said Bitcoin network growth will lead to inevitable demand via many factors, and ETF/bakkt was just one of them.
I see outrageous things posted here and on many chat/comment platforms - both in favor for and against bitcoin. If I had to go and individually address each one that's all I'd be doing. So if it makes you feel good to criticize me, have at it. I personally think it's petty and small, and you're lying out of your keyboard because again, I never said that.

Ha ha ha. Wait a few years, you'll get used to forgiving these drops in between the rises, in exchange for watching your investment grow. If you can't hold for at least 3-5 years though, bitcoin is not for you. You need to realize, you're like the thousandth person to say exactly what you just said over the years.

There are very constructive ways to disapprove of something like bakkt.
 
If it failed? Of COURSE I'd still be around Ive been on crypto for ages why on earth would I stop if bakkt failed. Seriously man, I mean I'm not an uptight guy, but you should smarten up  before you run your mouth off to the wrong person.
@_date: 2018-10-03 15:53:29
Well who knows. There's no P/E ratio and it's completely different mechanics and quite different from a stock. We need to consider the value built around the crypto industry. The billions of revenue in exchanges, the network value, the reliability and accuracy of the accounting ledger and math &amp; redundancy behind it, and of course the potential for solving real world issues not even considered yet.

Why would you do that? That would be stupid. When I sold Square Inc the P/E ratio was over 1000! Don't even get me started on Salesforce, GoDaddy or Hubspot. I got out thinking it couldn't possibly go higher yet they continue to rise based on nothing but speculation. Sound familiar? Now, I know there are several variables to consider but for the sake of comparison to Bitcoin I think it's a very valid point. This is because of the whole "intrinsic value" debate. Once a stock is overvalued to that extent it's all speculation and the intrinsic value is no more certain than the crypto space at all. Now the intrinsic value of bitcoin is another debate for another day, that I'm quite tired of to be honest.

I think you're either playing devils advocate or you haven't considered any of the points I've made already. You're analyzing a single spoke of a wheel that solves a much larger problem.
- Apple Pay simple works as a digital medium for a currency that has already been established. That's not as impressive as one may think.
- I've said multiple times, Bitcoin as a mainstream currency would take generations if at all.
- Try sending huge payments to another country with Apple Pay for the costs of a few pennies, including the conversion of currency.
- What about the investment asset aspect? Store of value? Global acceptance? Network value? 
- The first cars in 1770 were horrible and did not hold a candle to horses... they couldn't move as fast, go nearly as many places, and even as cars were improved they required an entire new ecosystem of roads to interconnect main locations. They weren't dinosaurs compared to horses, they were the beginning of something that was not replaced, but rather, improved ongoing.
Bitcoin also requires an entire ecosystem to be built before its true value can be realized.

Umm, have you ever used early OS's? I have used most of them and let me tell you, there was no incentive for anyone to use them if they didn't have to for work or were not an enthusiast. But it's how things start out.
Look, I think it's common sense that more users and wider use will legitimatize BTC (Probably LTC) as a currency, investment and as a store of value. I hate typing out shit that everyone already knows, but as a currency:
\- Transactions international or local, incur limited or no fees.
\- Banks are not needed for transactions
\- Bitcoin/Litecoin can be exchanged into other currencies efficiently and function as a global currency. With more and more people shopping online, this is a big one.
\- Business doesn’t have to pay for processing sensitive information from customers, such as credit card numbers
\- Perfect math maintaining the ledger and no accountants to pay
\- Bitcoin/Litecoin accounting transparency - No need for businesses to produce documents about activities
\- No cost of fraud risk for the merchant because Bitcoin/Litecoin transactions become final once confirmed
Now as far as incentives for the customers only, I mean that's an easy one. Imagine scanning apps to pay.. we kind of already are on that road. Once crypto becomes efficient and adoption increases it could be a pretty easy transition. Nobody "ASKED" for the tap feature on credit cards right? It just showed up and we used it cause it's convenient. I believe Bitcoin has the ability to go way beyond anywhere that FIAT can go in terms of future convenience that aligns with future tech. It's far more adaptable and  scaleable  than anything we have today.
**EDIT**:  FYI I still see Litecoin as the currency for smaller purchases and Bitcoin as the investment and store of value.

At the very least, why not take some time to learn the benefits of Bitcoin that create the value that's encouraging the growing infrastructure globally. As for gold, it's not really any mystery why so many see how bitcoin could easily fill that role as a store of value. Gold was not chosen for a digital society. As an accurate record keeper and accounting system to securily store value, Bitcoin is many times better than gold in almost every way.

It's not really advice as much as an observation :). So if for all who bought it before it hit 20 k...say back when it was 6k, they made significantly more than stocks. Just so happens, it's in the 6k range again now. Advice might be well given to buy.
@_date: 2018-10-22 13:44:43
Well, the framework is being laid out, and that takes time. For big artificial spikes based only on hype like last year's short-lived bubble, that's interest following price, better known as FOMO! Soon as people realized investors were making gains, media outlets jumped on this olive branch to generate get rich quick articles because they generate a lot of traffic, which brings in ad revenue. The whole thing spiraled out of control with a snowball effect of price rising and more people chasing the rising price and FOMOing in.
Fast-forward to now: We have far more developments, framework, partnerships in the works, more ways to get involved, etc. What started out as a currency has been recognized as an entire industry of mining, storage companies, store of value potential, speculative investment, and much more. Once it all kicks in together, it will probably be like a lot of tech in the past, where a surge will happen and the price of Bitcoin would have to follow, since more people will be looking for a piece of the same pie... a pie that can't get any larger because of the cap on supply. Eventually it could easily be used for its original intended purpose also, as a currency, but not one that replaces FIAT at first. Instead I believe it will run as an alternative currency and see wide adoption for online transactions and cross border transfers.   
Either way, the volume will come and few will see it coming. The foundation is getting created, and once this thing kicks in you'll have all the volume you ever wanted and much more.
@_date: 2018-10-09 19:25:15


Clearly your mind is made up so let's agree to disagree. I could give you a hundred examples of technology that people kept working on and it became game changing to society... even though so many could not see the potential because they looked ONLY at the current state and not at the potential of what it can become. I guarantee you, this is what you are doing right now. And so what? There's no law that requires us to have the same opinion.
@_date: 2018-10-25 16:27:07
I get where you're coming from in terms of being tired of reading about it, but what you're wishing for is failure. If a product offered to the crypto space from Intercontinental Exchange Inc, perhaps the largest institution there is in the investment world (next to Hong Kong exchanges), fails? What else would succeed in the near future? Nothing else proposed so far comes from an organization that is even close to ICE with regards to their participation and  comprehension of investment platforms.

@_date: 2018-10-09 18:03:17
Exactly - You need to start somewhere. By the time the general public are using technology daily, years of growth preceded. Everything takes time.  One of the biggest criticisms of the early internet was that it wasted electricity to accommodate the sharing of 100 GB of data each day. Well now, the world has gone from sharing 100 gigabytes/day back in 1992 to well over 30,000 gigabytes per SECOND. Bitcoin is not going away, it's just going to become more and more a part of society. It's only very early in the process.
@_date: 2018-10-28 22:58:37

Welcome back cipher! A lot has changed my man, real value getting established. I agree with you, I never would have believed we'd see a bitcoin over 6k this soon, it's crazy!
Honestly, I'm just glad we're finally getting to a place where the people claiming "no intrinsic value" will finally have to shut up and go away lol.
@_date: 2018-10-18 16:21:12
Buying Bitcoin increases price, selling Bitcoin decreases price. If bakkt sees a large number of buyers then it will increase the price.
This is impossible to price in because Bakkt is not open for buyers yet. It's pretty straight forward.
And there most definitely no way to price in the confidence that something like this will do for public perception and FOMO.
@_date: 2018-10-09 12:09:50
I realize that trolls are a necessary evil on here, but why go with the 600GB ledger? I mean why not tether scare tactics and conspiracies or manipulation like the other trolls? 
@_date: 2018-10-26 00:03:36
Hoping...not expecting. Everything so far has been rejected so if anything, nobody is expecting. That's why the whole priced in thing is highly unlikely. Once the first platform/product such as bakkt or an ETF is approved ..then you'll start seeing higher expectations and a lot more priced in to BTC.
@_date: 2018-10-09 14:21:56
Look if you want to look for these things in ANY technology, investment, role with a specific company, or any aspect of life, you will 100% find it. What I'm saying is that I would much rather prefer to focus on all the potential of Bitcoin and the blockchain it runs on. I too read articles as we all do, and I enjoy learning about developments that are painting a clear picture of Bitcoin being used on a main stream scale. 
I find it interesting and I occasionally post about that stuff on here. Yes, I sometimes talk about the coin price and how something like bakkt can fast track Bitcoin from an investment perceptive, but mostly I talk about adoption and advancement of the bitcoin blockchain.  Recently I read that along with the efforts to layer and scale, they are now looking at ways to implement smart contracts on Bitcoin's chain and the idea of what may happen in the years to come is fascinating to me. If you truly believe that tether will halt all that progress that's your choice. I personally think that a fall of tether would not stop bitcoin anymore than Mt Gox did. It may create a setback, and disrupt the entire crypto space. It may even cause bitcoin to drop to 4k temporarily, but I see a future where millions of people use Bitcoin to purchase online, store value like a savings account, invest even as a hedge or high risk portion of portfolio at first, etc. 
One last point. As we move forward, more and more platforms will allow the shift between FIAT and crypto quickly. Tether is a trading tool first and a temporary fill-in for FIAT. Are they hiding something? Is there a shady reason for not providing an audit of their currency reserves? Who knows! We can talk about it all day but we won't have an answer.
@_date: 2018-10-23 18:55:39
Woah, excellent point!!
@_date: 2018-10-15 11:52:37
Why would anyone cash out of crypto because of that? If anything, they'd be putting the money back into Bitcoin and stronger performing alts. Soon, there's going to be all sorts of changes in stable coins, FIAT pairs, etc. Tether may be but a distant memory in the growing pains of crypto. ...Or it could continue being the most utilized trading tool in the crypto space lol. 
@_date: 2018-10-22 02:09:29
Don't be such a fanboy :). There's more to Bitcoin than the coin price speculation. That will all come in due time. Moon lambo talk is what gives this sub a bad name.

@_date: 2018-10-22 00:26:24
Nope. They were dismissed as stupid hundreds of times first. A small few who believed in them jumped on board, a few small road systems were developed, used by a very niche group of people. The speed limit was forced down to 20 mph so they wouldn't spook the horses lol.
These things take time, and the companies with stakes of billions in the bet that crypto will suceed would very much disagree with you.  
Besides, high risk investment and store of value would likely overshadow currency use first. High risk investment is integrated with speculation all the time, nothing wrong with that. In short term BTC may hit 50k or it may drop to 5k, who cares? We all know this space is growing and personally I'd rather be in invested for when it sticks.
@_date: 2018-10-09 13:05:57
Explain yourself. Do you have any idea of the problems that have been overcome with network limitations and bandwidth over the past years of online communications? Again, if you want to challenge Bitcoin's success this is not a strong argument at all. There are loads of FUD articles out there on tether, forks, manipulation, etc. Go pick one and join the sheep.
@_date: 2018-10-03 18:33:26
Of course I can. First of all I'm talking about the entire market being overvalued, because there's no specific stat that really provides that information. I also used the phrase 'uncharacteristically overvalued'. Specific stocks I can lose the "in my opinion" but when speculating on speculation? Yeah, I can most definitely be subjective. Curious though; With all due respect, with of all the semantic disasters, poor grammar and talk of 'lambos' and 'moon' on this thread, what in the world would drive you to pick my use of 'in my opinion' to critique? lol.
@_date: 2018-10-22 00:12:22
As I said, why would anyone have invested in cars in those first few decades when horses could go anywhere, and move faster without requiring gasoline? But that was the time to invest, not when it's even more obvious. Few people could envision the road systems (infrastructure) that could be built, and the speed cars would eventually  reach on these roads. 
Without vision there is only denial of potential. Are you really basing the success of Bitcoin and crypto on current state? Even though it's come this far in 10 years already? You believe the progress is just going to stop? That these early ATMs represent how it's all going to look in another 10 years?
@_date: 2018-10-26 11:41:32
I'm not a pro. Some of the people I collaborate with have been trading and even mining Bitcoin for years. Compared to them I know very little. You seem far more concered with your ego and being right than you do with sharing and learning. The smartest people I've known over the years are those who are aware of how much they still have yet to learn.
If you still think Bitcoin has no value after the multiple times this argument has been debunked, I would genuinely suggest that you consider the network it runs on and the revenue that is generated by the crypto space. I didn't think there were still people out there that made the "no intrinsic value" claim.
Anyway good luck with being always right. We are just random user names on reddit to each other, so no need for either of us to take this stuff personally. Bakkt and any similar platform product coming down the pipe are just stepping stones to a maturing crypto landscape. Priced in, not priced in, it isn't what matters to the bigger picture.

I'm sorry, but I work with these things every day and while there are a lot of things I still learn all the time, I can tell that you are a person who has formed a very rigid opinion on all of this (I am not assuming you approach other perspectives this way). You know as well as I do that the graph you linked means nothing to this conversation. I could tell you anything and you would likely cherry pick random information that you believe justifies your stance on Bitcoin. I mean no disrespect, I just can tell you have already shut the door on what's happening when it comes to Bitcoin. 
I'd offer you only one piece of advice - stop evaluating Bitcoin on currency use, that's not what's bringing in the third party investment in surrounding infrastructure. It is now a financial Macro investment that has potential to become a currency once enough people own it. That will require a lot of building on the infrastructure and the protocol itself - things you don't need to occur for 'ahem' washing machines and iPads :).

God, you're treating bitcoin like a stock. These platforms you mentioned aren't open for trading yet. If they're successful then the additional purchasing of Bitcoin compounded with the positive impact on public sentiment would affect the price. That has not happened yet, and can't possibility be priced in. I realize you belive you're some sort of empowered future teller and that's bizarre no doubt, but surely you can understand that difference between bitcoin and a stock share.

I agree with cipher, your fantasies are messed up, but whatever you're into I suppose! I definitely agree that calling someone old is not an insult. That makes no sense. Every person that has ever lived on earth has to age every day, and you either are lucky enough to keep living long enough to get old and wiser, or you are not as fortunate and don't get to live to be older. How in the hell can you possibly think calling someone old is an insult!? If you're lucky, you'll get to stay around long enough to be older and you'll appreciate that concept.

That is a good point. Bitcoin was created to solve the problem of double spending so a Bitcoin transaction can only be reversed when there is a zero confirmation on the blockchain.  However, I would not be one bit surprised if some future implementation, possibly within the Lightning Network, addresses this.

Because they are programmed to believe what they've been reading in click bait articles for the past year. Most people commenting on tether scares are only understanding wash trading and  arbitrage between exchanges. Then they blindly assume that the price of BTC has been propped up by tether - this is where assumption goes wild. There's no proof that the price of BTC has been elevated by tether. In fact, one could easily say it's been held down by tether.

I had little to put faith in during previous bear markets. There was little happening. But these days I can barely keep up with it all. If it bounced back from previous "certain death" I'm fairly confident that the next recovery will make the last few pale in comparison.
No, at least not in my lifetime will it replace the dollar. Will it run along side Fiat as an alternative currency imo? Yes, particularly for online purchases and cross border transactions. Will it become a part of pension funds? That's inevitable as far as I'm concerned. Anything that has been 20k and now 6k but still growing in terms of infrastructure will have a place in the high risk allocation of a portfolio. And people won't have any issues with 1-2% of risk or hedge.
By the same token, if you're skeptical, who can blame you? I just would politely suggest you not deny a reality of incredibly large sums of money invested into this space by some very  successful and intelligent people, and some very large organizations.
@_date: 2018-10-27 18:17:32
I honestly have no idea what you're talking about. It's almost as though you're replying to a post different than what I wrote. I have several close friends that are house builders and contractors and yes, they do very well. I was simply addressing the crazy logic the OP positioned. Of course not everyone would be wealthy because the vast majority would not want to take the risk.  Are you offended that I used the word vision? I'm sure you know I meant there. Just that the small few that take the risk of investing early and are the ones that benefit if that risk pays off. This has absolutely nothing to do with house builders, that's just the example OP used.
Seems you're just looking for something to criticize.
You want to get nit picky? How about the massive lack of understandimg demonstrated in OPs post regarding distribution of Bitcoin. Even if Bitcoin were to be valued at 1 million per coin, that's equivalent to only 1 cent per satoshi. What he's implying about everyone becoming rich is ridiculous. By the time bitcoin could be used as a mainstream currency and distributed among the global population, any opportunity to own even 1 Bitcoin would be very small compared to today.

I never would have believed bitcoin could have possibly been something that the SEC would even have spent 5 minutes on. And the owners of the NYSE creating a platform to onboard investors?? If anyone said that even 3 years ago theyd have been laughed off and passed off as mentally unstable by people with your attitude. The only thing I can't comprehend is why now after all this is there still even people with your perception left? How long have you been learning about all this? Have you mined? Do you follow the progess of any coders? Have you researched any partnerships? Any regular podcasts? Because if your basing your entire perspective of Bitcoin on one year out of ten...one of the worst years... you should consider broadening your lens.

This is why completely 'replacing' the dollar is likely lifetimes away. Bitcoin/Litecoin etc. could easily become mainstream currency, but it has to be bench marked. So, if a mortgage/loan is agreed upon and amortization is settled, it would be in terms of whatever amount of Bitcoin will equal the amount of dollars required for the monthly payment.
Bitcoin running alongside of current FIAT structure is the only way to transition to a cryptocurrency economy and that transition would take many years. The solutions to issues of the future are not created yet, so naturally we don't think about them as we will once they materialize. As an example, many perspectives of the future of media storage when CDs and DVD disks were mainstream, was that the future would be tiny disks lol! Nobody thought in terms of SSD drives and streaming! In the same way, it's really difficult to see how a constant value will be determined in a Bitcoin economy, but I have no doubt we will find a way.

The whole thing is blown way out of proportion.

It's early days in crypto, and there has to be a few bear market years just like there's been years of bull markets. 
All this analysis of every little detail to explain why the price is up or down is getting old. New doors will open and some old ones will close. Buy it, trade it or go play in another yard. The drama queens are just repeating themselves, and it's boring AF.

That's how things evolve people. NOT by looking around today and saying "oh look nobody uses Bitcoin to buy from retailers. Oh well let's give it all up". That's what complacent closed minded people think, but thankfully we have innovative thinkers and many who support forward movement. I believe that Bitcoin and crypto have a gigantic role in future society, and while it needs time to materialize, it's not as far away as many may think.

**Sony Unveils Contactless Cryptocurrency Hardware Wallet** \- This is not small news. What it represents is involvement in the crypto space from big, legit players. The thing is, I remember a time when this kind of a headline would have been hard to believe. These days developments are springing up out of the woodwork, and the price and volume remain unaffected. In my opinion, this is because we are in a period where there were so many claims of a $100,000 Bitcoin over the past year that people not even invested yet are extra cautious. BUT ... once the reality of all these developments, investment platform, layers, sidechains, etc kicks in to gear, we may see a surge in a very short time. Bottom line, this space is maturing quickly and the future looks very bright for bitcoin and the crypto space, no matter how you choose to view it!
@_date: 2019-11-24 20:15:58
You must be new. This is but a scratch compared to what Bitcoin has endured. But don't feel bad...you're the millionth person to say that and be wrong in the past 5 years lol.
@_date: 2018-10-18 22:28:38
If you used "I think" or "in my opinion" before these type of statements, your posts would hold a lot more credibility. So many experts, both those bullish and bearish have been wrong on so many bitcoin related fronts, you'd think by now it would be clear that nobody knows where anything is headed. It appears that based on all the growth of crypto around the globe over the past years, that it isn't going away, so who knows what developments will unfold along the way! 
@_date: 2018-10-15 20:38:46
That's not the point, and please, don't compare Bitcoin to a product like a TV that you can market with a companies marketing budget. It wasn't crypto ads, it was hype. The price start going up with a few catalysts last year... different experts claim different cataylsts including Futures, Tether, etc. Once the price was rising people started to FOMO in. Then every click bait article out there was about people getting rich on Bitcoin and further adding to the hype. These articles are not written to inform us, they are written and more importantly, titled, to draw us in and generate ad revenue. If the hot topic is getting rich on BTC then that's what they'll pump out in MSM. If it's Bitcoin is tanking then they'll write about that. 
@_date: 2018-10-17 19:35:55
The fearmongers are getting fewer and fewer in numbers which means the opportunity to buy at low prices is getting smaller and smaller. When these posters stop trying to spread bullshit about bitcoin being dead, failed or going to drop below 6k, then it will be too late.
When people say they wish they'd bought bitcoin when it was a fraction of the current price at that time, the reason they didn't buy it then is usually because people are afraid that it's too risky. By the time everyone wants to buy it, the opportunity has aleady passed.
@_date: 2018-10-18 21:22:14
Absolutely! If only more people shared your take on that.

Absolutely, iPhone got it right for sure. There was some confusion though in the comments. I just meant that early text based OS had to happen first to get to the next step of graphic OS with mouse etc. Nobody thought early computers were efficient. Most people couldn't grasp how they could possibly benefit productivity. Yet here we are. It's very difficcult to see things that don't exist yet, even though once they exist it's difficult to see life without them.

It's far far more valuable than a company. Or at least it will be seen that way in the future. It's an exceptional record keeper of transactions on a global level. A little vision of what is yet to come rarely exists. Nobody really saw what the internet would become either, especially in its early days.
And yes, any company would crumble under that bad publicity. If MSM was full of articles trashing Apple products nobody would buy them,  just as an example. You can't pay bills without sales.

Most people are not emotionally affected by day to day price changes. With the stock market and everything else going on, it's just another day. Unless your day trading bitcoin (in which case you may have made a killing today), there's nothing to be concerned about here. Just nod and smile and buy the dips until the next run up lol.
@_date: 2018-10-22 20:00:10
\- Well first off, without alternatives we'd be in bad shape. Bitcoin can be a very successful alternative currency for digital transactions. It can move millions of dollars of value for 10 cents. And it's global, decentralized and not tied to any one country or region!
\- It's can serve as a global record keeper for transactions that is backed by perfect math and exceptional redundancy.
\- It's a push system, not a pull system, so nobody can steal your money without access to your private keys.
\- There's nothing wrong with an investment opportunity, or even a gamble - Gambling is a very very big industry. Vegas is an enormous machine that generates revenue, creates jobs, etc.
\- As a high-risk portion of a portfolio it can easily become a standard part of an overall investment plan or even retirement plan as the space matures.
\- It may be on its early legs, but Bitcoin has the potential to be the most secure, accurate and efficient store of value the world has even seen hands down.
\- Then there's the network value; ask any large company how much they'd value a network with impeccable accuracy that has never been hacked, experienced 99.9% up time over 10 years, and eliminates the cost of maintenance, because it requires no accountants or employees... it maintains itself and everyone involved gets their fair share on a freelance structure (miners for example).
That's just off the top of mind. Imagine the possibilities when the space actually gets built and matures. Because if there's one thing nobody can argue, it's that even though the price moves in big spikes and drops, there's been no slack on the growth of infrastructure.  Just wait until it becomes easy for non-technical people to acquire and store with confidence.
@_date: 2018-10-09 22:50:07
My thoughts are that there are a lot of benefits of a global currency and solutions that we haven't even considered yet. I guess that's the thing about innovation. As an accurate tamper proof ledger though, Bitcoin delivers.

Please see comment reply below. My point is they are far over their estimated intrinsic value which is really what drives the conversation to Bitcoin being 100% speculation. Many stocks are way overshot on P/E and once you get to that point you are at as much speculation and risk as crypto. The stock market is uncharacteristically overvalued this past year or so IMO. I hope I'm wrong but the next crash could make 2008 look pale in comparison. 
@_date: 2019-11-16 00:10:46
That's it in a nutshell. No matter how low it goes, there will always be some nut job calling for lower and no matter how high it goes there's always a moon boy saying it's just gonna keep climbing. 3.2k they were calling 2k... didn't happen.

Exactly. So that means all those people out there who would like to invest in Bitcoin but lack the technical confidence to mess around with wallett addresses and storage (which is still most people who represent average investors) will have a platform to do so, which removes  the technical requirement. The more people that buy via bakkt the more BTC bakkt has to buy to meet demand.

If you experienced last year's run up first hand you would see how interest follows price in a FOMO situation. Loads of new players entered the game to chase a rising price in hopes it would continue to rise. Interest and price feed off of each other in investments, completely opposite of any other purchase really.

Well, I suppose ya can't knock a person for preferring entertainment over finances sometimes. I spend a lot of time monitoring stocks, crypto and real estate to be informed, particularly during bear markets, because let's face it that's where the entry points are.
But I definitely spend my share of those profits on entertainment! Curious though how you find entertainment in a crypto bear market, stock market correction or real estate bubble etc ... I've never seen these things as entertaining... especially the 2008 stock market crisis or the 2014 crypto bear with the Mt Gox drama. And the current crypto bear market is like watching paint dry compared to those days!
But hey ... to each their own! I'll stick to night clubs, netflix, sex and cinema. Meanwhile, you enjoy watching people debate the best cold storage choice and repeat placing the same ol bitcoin is dead comments on thier posts. Long as you're happy, because life is short!

How can you price in a product that isn't active yet? If it becomes active, and people start purchasing bitcoin via bakkt and an etf that doesn't run solely on derivitives, then the additional buying will drive the price up. Plus being approved would further legitimize bitcoin and have a positive impact on public sentiment. This can't be priced in like stock projections.
@_date: 2018-10-03 22:35:32
That reply is so not in touch with reality. The internet is an extension of, built upon and comprised of darpanet. Without darpanet there would be no internet, period. Without the bitcoin blockchain of the past decade there could not be what it will evolve into with wallet address translation, additional layers, etc. Please don't try to separate the internet from it's inception and first 30 years of growth... that's a huge lack of history and background to explain what the internet is and how it came to be. It is also why it is so very much compared to Bitcoin.

And now you're telling it's dead again?? But the thing keeps getting bigger and bigger and more exchanges and more apps, and Lightning Network, and layers, and side chains, and more mining companies and more investment funds and Fidelity and Bakkt and...and ...and AARRHHHHHGGGG!!!

I agree with that, but I don't necessarily think that people who don't see where bitcoin is headed are stupid. Vision for future potential is difficult to see and people who are closed minded or complacent in thier current perspective find it very difficult to expand their horizon of thinking. 
For example, the guy who wrote that article was extremely smart and tech savvy, but he was not able to see past the way things were at that time. With Bitcoin, some of the biggest critics are accountants and finance people for that very same reason. It's not that they're stupid, it's just that they are very much set in thier way of thinking and lack vision.

Yes, BTC price manipulation is real. Recently there has been a lot of talk about infrastructures and systems to allow for smoother accessibility for institutional investment. Now we have this drastic price drop, that will conveniently allow for a VERY attractive entry point.

From WikiTextBot:
**Hype cycle**
The hype cycle is a branded graphical presentation developed and used by the American research, advisory and information technology firm Gartner, for representing the maturity, adoption and social application of specific technologies. The hype cycle provides a graphical and conceptual presentation of the maturity of emerging technologies through five phases.
An example of a hype cycle is found in Amara's law coined by Roy Amara, which states that
We tend to overestimate the effect of a technology in the short run and underestimate the effect in the long run.

That whole 51% thing is overblown. Media does this with pretty much everything crypto related because it makes them a fortune through ad clicks and views.
A lot of miners are in pools, so the hardware would not really be in that 51%. Now that being said, the block being mined is still chosen by the pool authority and protocol but there are new protocols being proposed and this stuff will constantly be improved and upgraded. Everyone really needs to understand how much improvement will be made to the entire Bitcoin network over the next 5-10 years and that's the time frame you need to consider, not this day to day fiat price bullshit. Bitcoin is  being woven into the fabric of our society and the haters and morons who comment without any understanding of what is going in the world are just noise.

It's not about being excited simply because there was a $200 lift in price. It's about phscology and confirmation that the doom and gloom being broadcasted by the banker's perspective is total crap.
Plus, we hear institutional money is coming. We hear a bull run may be coming. Everyone is waiting for the signal, for a sign.
Then when the timing lines up, and we see a few lifts, buyer confidence rises. Everyone jumps on board the same time and the bull run is initiated. 
That's what happened last December. It was volume of small investments, not big players that created the December 20k ath.

Considering the massive progress that Bitcoin has made in such a short time, it would be safer to assume that once regulations, infrastructure, ease of entry and awareness increase, Bitcoin will become a very well fitted choice for a store of value into years to come.

Less poor?? You are out of the loop. The only way anyone could be in the red on bitcoin is if they only ever bought it a tiny fraction of the time it has existed during the past 10 years. Lol, now that person would be a total idiot. Oh...wait, did you buy it high and forget to buy any the other 95% of the past decade? Wow, you're transparent.
@_date: 2018-06-14 03:23:19
Again, those other projects don't have 10 years of stability to back the confidence required to move forward. As you said, blockchain is the underlying tech, and rest assured BTC can be upgraded, layered and improved. 10 years with 99.99% uptime and stability under huge volume provides the test pass to move forward. These new projects may encounter multiple bugs and flaws that are yet to be discovered and are nowhere near catching up to the progress in real use case that Bitcoin has made.

@_date: 2018-06-29 18:51:43
Claim? I've been following tech for years, and have personal interest, yes .. but anyone would have to be a complete IDIOT to not see that Bitcoin is here stay. Look at the past decade, consider that most people never even heard of it a year ago, and now there's billions being spent all over the globe on infrastructure to make it more accessible. AND we don't even have wallet address translation in place for non tech-savvy users yet. This is just the beginning!!  
You really need to stop looking at the token price, because that's INCREDIBLY short sighted. WHY THE FAWK would I post a picture to support my statement? Seriously, this is Reddit. I don't give a flying crap about who believes me or who don't, I'm just stating my perspective. It just happens that Bitcoin has dropped and recovered like this over and over and that was before the global interest it has now.
@_date: 2018-06-29 19:42:04
Actually history is the best indicator of repeating patterns, and to date, nothing presents a better estimate of future patterns.  
But that being said, after 10 years Bitcoin is only now finally getting global awareness. We should all at least consider that the massive growth (NOT token price growth) in infrastructure, accessibility, etc  is just the beginning of a technology that will very likely be implemented deep into the future of finance.
@_date: 2019-08-28 11:42:21
All fiat will be converted to, or represented by, a cryptocurrency before too long. This brings it into the ecosystem with bitcoin and means quick-shifting from btc to fiat. Since Bitcoin is the decentralized option, it should remain the universal alternative. Progress.
@_date: 2018-06-24 14:05:25
I mean they make their cut whether you buy or sell. High volume places their infrastructure under pressure and reveals the flaws and weak components. Low volume provides an opportunity to focus on improvement and upgrades. Exchanges are aware of these cycles and anyone looking at Bitcoin's 10 year chart can see these phases are very typical. Yes, people will lose money if they need it now. Otherwise prepare for a long road because nothing can evolve at the rate many people have been expecting from Bitcoin. Do you really honestly think Coinbase for example would have made the massive investment they recently made to accommodate the next phase if they didn't feel confident it was coming? This is what these guys do day in day out, EVERY day. They eat sleep and breath it, negotiating with partnerships and market studies on all aspects of crypto all over the globe. You really think you know something they don't?
@_date: 2018-06-29 19:46:24
Of course not, because great risk can result in great reward and most average people will not sink 10k into an investment that everyone else is selling. Sure they can be aware of the historical patterns, sure they can be told that Bitcoin has crashed literally HUNDREDS of times, but that does not make them risk takers. You can't get rich by making a comfortable decision, by then it's too late. Many people have million dollar ideas but very few implement them and get a million dollars. Same reason .. risk  scares most people away.

The internet started in the 60s and finally made it into homes as a slow dial up service in the 90s. Then well into the 2000s we get decent speeds and bandwidth. 
What took 40 years then, can be done in about 15 years or less today, thanks to the speed and connectivity of the very network platform that the internet provides.
Now consider that most people only started hearing about Bitcoin less than a year ago. 
@_date: 2018-06-29 12:23:28
But it's been this way forever. The weak are afraid to buy or even hold, the only thing they buy is the fear and give in to it. Then they react with childishness, and start throwing insults at the very same thing they were praising just a short while ago.   
It's typical human behavior and that's why the more intelligent people are risk takers and make money. They see the opportunity where everyone just sees fear and doom. Rinse and repeat - and yet some people just act like sheep and fall into pattern. Deep down everyone knows Bitcoin is going to be here longer than any of us, but it's easier to think short term and prioritize the fear.
@_date: 2018-06-24 23:05:26

@_date: 2018-06-29 02:08:20
That's simply because none of those things had the internet to fast track them. Bitcoin is a global currency digitally stored and if you think it's even CLOSE to going away I'm not sure there's not anything else that can be said until you stop forming an opinion without any real world knowledge. Name 5 countries that are implementing it, name 5 decentralized exchanges and give a short explanation of each one's model, and listen to a handful of interviews from people like Jimmy Song (Bitcoin developer). That's nothing but at least then you may have had to learn enough to see what's going on globally.

Because it's up over 300% this year alone, and for a lot of people that's worth selling and making a big profit. For many others who are accumulating via DCA and holding their investment long term, this is another opportunity to buy. People say they wish they'd gotten bitcoin when it was 50 bucks. But guess what? The vast majority of people who obtained bitcoin for a few dollars, or mined it on their PC, or bought it for 50 bucks, sold it at $100, $200 etc., because they made incredible gains and had no way of knowing it would reach thousands of dollars per coin. Same goes for people now - they want to enjoy their profits now. Personally, I am in this for the long term because I believe bitcoin will continue to increase in the long term and I didn't invest money I need right away. To each their own, there is no wrong or right!

NOBODY knows. But if you wanna look smart you have a 50&amp; chance of being right! Personally I think people should be more concerned about accumulating, because one thing most agree on is that in the not so distant future, Bitcoin will almost certainly be a hell of a lot higher in price than it is now. When Bitcoin gets its legs there's going to be some serious disruption in how we finance and invest.

Remember, Finney was a major developer for PGP Corporation, and saw what the government did with that when the creator of PGP, Phil Zimmermann, faced federal prosecution. I Imagine Finney was aware of what they night have done to a project like bitcoin, with the intention of competing with fiat and he wanted to remain anonymous to ensure the bitcoin project got off the ground. I think it makes sense anyway.

And which government would that be? The countries that benefit from Bitcoin will adopt it first. You need to stop thinking Bitcoin is tied any one country or region. You also need to give it far more time before ever evaluating Bitcoin as a currency. That is premature thinking. Imagine condemning the early internet because it couldn't accommodate video streaming and large file transfers due to limited bandwidth. Imagine condemning the concept of wireless video chat. You get the point. Of course Bitcoin can't work as a currency yet! Most average people never even heard of Bitcoin before a year ago!!! People really need to grasp the time it takes for adoption.
@_date: 2019-08-09 13:32:41
Isn't that kind of the point? Even with heavy regulations, the stock market still involves manipulation, so why criticize the bitcoin market when it's so young? Give it a chance to mature, and in the mean time, jumping in now during these early days could easily prove to be one of the most rewarding risks you ever take. You are criticizing something for not being what it has not yet had time to  become. Think about that.

It's gotta drop a little once in a while. We had a good 6 months of climb so you have to expect a few months of profit taking before we continue up the hill. Remember, even as the industry around bitcoin expands and development continues, it's still a market and in markets, people take profits. Buy the dips when you can, and chill. If you're not in this for the long game, you might get spooked by the volatility and it's not for you.
@_date: 2019-08-15 18:24:13
The only case is for long term growth, due to the efficient bitcoin protocol track record of a solid 10 years of 100% up time and no failure or hacks, with endless potential to be built upon. As for 9k, who knows? It's up and down all the time with the long term path being upwards. Zoom out on the past 10 years of a bitcoin price chart and it's obvious.

Just the profits, and leaving the initial investment in the stocks? Man there's nothing wrong with that in my opinion. You are basically investing in bitcoin without risking any of your initial stake... AND you are probably DCA'ing because you invest as the profits come.  It's probably one of the better strategies for conservative participation that I've seen on here.

Yeah buying and selling can manipulate the price, especially in this relatively new, low volume market, of course. So we're saying that whole Chinese Ponzi thing did impact the price now again? I thought that the whole massive sell off was determined to be fake news after? Price isn't doing much of anything different than it has for a while now though so I guess it wasn't too devastating.
@_date: 2019-08-18 15:12:09
Unlike stocks, bitcoin doesn't seem to spike based on the news of things like bakkt. Once bakkt is fully up and running, that's when we'll most likely see its effect on the price because participation in bakkt futures can mean large players buying bitcoin. This rings true for most developments in this space. As much as the price is speculated, an increase in purchasing of bitcoin is highly dependent on the platforms and on ramps that build trust and legitimacy to bring in new buyers. Once we've broken down the current psychological barriers and the infrastructure to participate in bitcoin is fully integrated, the potential price per BTC can be much higher than even the wildest claims suggest.
I know I say this a lot, but these are still very early times in Bitcoin's story.
@_date: 2019-08-16 11:49:29

Internet just got here, and the internet changes EVERYTHING. Anything that can be streamed, shared, stored in cloud, data, finances, shared docs, music, movies, etc. has been transitioned to online. Gold being around for thousands of years is irrelevant, because again...the internet JUST got here.
If you honestly believe that future generations of digital societies will continue digging rocks out of the ground like cavemen to account for their value, be my guest. They can still use gold for electronics if they wish lol. The use for electronics and trinkets hardly compares to bitcoins decentralized distributed ledger, which removes billions of dollars in middle men and removes countless points of failure. Efficiency wins.
@_date: 2019-08-05 19:03:19
DCA is simple. You'd have bought it in small amounts every day, week, month, whatever schedule you set for yourself. If you see a big dip like we had last year when we hit 3200, you have caught the lowest price with some of your buys, and that would see you breaking even much sooner. Every now and then, you might want to throw a little more money in if you have some extra cash,  but you stick to your schedule and NEVER wait because you think it may drop lower. When it was 3200 people called for 2k - IGNORE those people. When it was 9200 last week people called for 8k range - IGNORE those people. Just stick to your schedule and it will level you out over time and you will see gains.
@_date: 2018-06-24 12:36:30
The need for instant gratification combined with greed, fear, stupidity and a lack of patience will result in people selling at a loss. Otherwise anyone selling now must have bought in when the price was low and are taking profits. 
So what? Bitcoin isn't going away or anything lol. It's going through a phase and right now, and nobody knows how to treat it. SEC say it's not a security and yet people treat it like an investment. Its hard to view it as a currency in countries where the money system works at least 'enough' that we aren't switching to Bitcoin/crypto YET. 
But we will figure out how to deal with Bitcoin once we really define its place in society. It will almost certainly evolve and increase in terms of adoption and certainly in price.
Why would anyone have expected the price to move any differently than it is? These things take time. But look around the world at growing crypto infrastructure and how crypto is solving real problems. It has to take more time but it's coming so no need to rush. Countries don't regulate ponzu schemes, so FFS people stop being so naive, stop calling it a scheme, let the 6 monthers and year long investors piss in their pants and sell at a loss. Let the early investors take their profits. Let time do its job.

It's too far away to possibly know or even speculate the advancements that will have been made in bitcoin, but basically miners are still paid fees.

Be weary of  how accurate the things you read online are. Did the Chinese Ponzi scheme exist? Yes.

I think that the very encouragement to hoard bitcoin because of the fixed supply will push the narrative for a store of value, the digital gold use case. Later in Bitcoin's story, once a large enough number of people own it, I think currency use can evolve. I mean value is not of much use if it isn't eventually exchanged for something valuable. It will take some time for the ecosystem to evolve before we see how a deflationary decentralized currency can really work. It will require ingenuity that will be demanded by the need for a solution. Open mind + enough time solves all.

You can either sell it when it goes back to 15k or you can hold it and sell it higher. 15k wasn't even a year ago and Bitcoin is only now becoming a real thing, showing up in the financial segment of news casts, getting infrastructure built etc. Unless you desperately need the cash don't sell at a loss.
@_date: 2019-08-29 01:27:10
Lol that's not bad. I mean trolling is lame but at least you got creative with this whole Goldman Sachs stop loss. Unfortunately for you, the "big money" as you referred to it, doesn't give 2 fucks about what Mr. faberg has to say on a reddit sub he obviously wouldn't be in if he truely felt as he posts. So anything you say on here won't influence much. Again, nice try though!

Yes, because the president of the country where its currency is used as the world's reserve currency, allowing the US to borrow at lower costs, is going to acknowledge the value of bitcoin. Sure, he "must" be on the up and up. He's going to be completely objective on bitcoin, right. Lol.

Internet started in a small niche with military use in the 60's and took nearly 4 decades to find it's way into mainstream. Bitcoin started in a small niche of developers and mining enthusiasts and is slowly making its way into mainstream. And it won't take 4 decades.

I've seen references to the comparison in the image linked below several times over the past while. It's pretty crazy how close the movement matches up.
What's even more interesting to me is that the very technology that allows the pattern to move 5X faster in the Bitcoin market cap chart is basically what the "dot-com bubble" time frame in the first chart reflects - The internet itself. The internet has increased access to information &amp; all other data so technology now evolves at an accelerated pace. What's positive for Bitcoin if it continues to follow this pattern at a 5X rate, is the next phase. :)

It can't happen overnight. Nothing does. To be objective (since I am obviously a huge long time believer in bitcoin), bitcoin didn't disappear back when there was no easy way to buy it, no industry built around it, and incredibly negative public sentiment after scandals like Mt Gox. In fact it has since thrived and now has billions of dollars in industry, apps and on ramps built around it. So why in the world would it disappear now?
@_date: 2019-10-16 18:26:05
You must be new. The conversations have been pretty much exactly like this since bitcoin was a few hundred bucks. And people just like you have been replying for years now saying it will go lower. But every 2 or 3 years, it just goes higher, and higher, and higher... So after reading your reply, I'm pretty sure it's gonna continue to climb.
@_date: 2019-08-23 10:29:41

It depends on how many roadblocks it encounters along the way. They blew up a lot of rockets trying to put man in space and they were pushing progress hard on the wire.

@_date: 2018-06-27 05:01:08
First off all, there are way more countries than the US and many of them are on board with Bitcoin. Second of all, nobody gives power away. It gets taken. Lastly, bitcoin doesn't need to replace current currencies for years. In this infant stage, Bitcoin simply need to offer a co-existing system that socially unites currency use on a global level.Think about it. The more that individual countries create be their own independent blockchain token in your scenario, the more value there is in a globally accepted currency that also functions as a store of value. The possibilities are endless and it's playing out like a book. If you can't envision just how embedded in our future this is going to be, you need to look harder.
@_date: 2019-08-19 20:54:17
Not sure of this is meant as a joke, but it sure does not align with reality. If you are heavily involved and invested in bitcoin than you just had a year to buy bitcoin for far less than current price, have made incredible gains,  and would not be talking this way. Also, if you truely were involved in  bitcoin you would not be calling it a "product" lol! 
Also, when you say half its past value, you would be implying that because bitcoin spiked to almost 20k for a day, you're ignoring that bitcoin is currently higher than its been for most of the time it existed. You ignore that anyone investing would NEVER simply have only bought almost 2 years ago during the tiny window of time when it was that high. If that's how you invest, you can't blame bitcoin. Oh, and news flash: thugs, as you called them, have been scammimg people using fiat since it existed. Do you blame fiat, or do you have enough sense to simply blame crime?
@_date: 2019-08-01 18:45:01
Again, it's a protocol and it works really really well. I have been working in IT for my entire life and I'd be shocked if bitcoin is replaced within the next 25 years. But hey, think whatever you will.
@_date: 2019-08-28 23:51:30

@_date: 2019-08-05 19:13:23
Nobody in the investing world will invest all they ever want to buy in one day. Bitcoin is highly volatile and DCA allows you catch all price ranges so you create an average buy that keeps you in the green. If you have a modest goal to say own 1 or 2 full bitcoin, why would you buy it all at once knowing it goes up and down unpredictably over the years. Catching dips through DCA is the opposite of trying to time the market.
@_date: 2018-06-13 15:16:02
Well it's an index, you hold it. You don't trade it. Getting your investors in at the lowest entry point since last year may be a pretty good idea. I'd say that the folks at Coinbase have somewhat of an 'in the know' advantage that easily keeps them more informed than all us on reddit combined. It's literally what they do every waking minute.  
So if they are investing this enormous amount of effort and money into institutional investment infrastructure, I'd say they have a fairly credible vision of what's coming down the pipe.

@_date: 2019-08-15 17:53:41
First of all, welcome aboard! I wish we could answer that for you my friend, but I have yet to see anyone on this sub or elsewhere ever accurately predict price movement. What I would suggest is to divide your end of month amount into several micro purchases, to catch multiple price points between now and the end of month. Any additional fees are not worth thinking about if you are fortunate enough to secure some BTC that gets a price hike. What I can tell you, is that DCA is 100% a strong strategy. Good luck!
@_date: 2019-08-15 04:32:44
Just a little over 2 weeks ago Bitcoin was 9500. This is an awful lot of drama for a price similar to a few weeks ago. Nothing has gone wrong, no catastrophe has occured and everything with bitcoin is the same as it was yesterday. Live your life for a week and check back. Well, if you got some money to catch some bitcoin at a better price that works too.

Well, for starters Bakkt does not launch until September. But Bakkt is simply a sign of times to come where the largest organizations on the planet are getting involved. Bitcoin is a not a stock where a business releases an earnings report or merger and then the price reacts. Bitcoin is about adoption, participation in the space, new industries getting on board, new on ramps between fiat and crypto, developments in the tech, halving of new bitcoin added to the supply, etc. One specific development, even one as big as ICE's involvement, is not the game changer. It's the cumulative efftect of industry that's constantly expanding around bitcoin, and there does not seem to be any lack of growth in that respect. Unless you're day trading the day to day price is not the focus. Look at the past 5 years and what's coming over the next 5.
@_date: 2019-08-20 13:01:54
So according to Blockchain.com, the Bitcoin hash rate has broken yet another new all-time high. The Bitcoin network keeps getting more secure. Remember when fools used to say Bitcoin will be replaced by some alt coin? Pfft, yeah right.

My only response could be to reinforce my previous point. It's multiple times safer than it was year ago and it didn't disappear then. Plus, in terms of safe, or secure, nothing is more secure than bitcoin. It has never been hacked, nor has the network ever gone down, in its ten years of existence.  This is why more and more trust is established in building upon the bitcoin protocol. Also, 1s and 0s are the building blocks of a vast amount of value in today's world.

Given time, I see bitcoin filling that role, at least as an alternative currency that aligns with the digital ecosystem, yes. Money  as streaming content. But I believe bitcoin will be a hybrid entity, functioning in many roles with multiple applications including store of value, investment asset, currency, and having multiple other capabilities added via layering. But I do think it's quite a few years away.

The last group you mentioned are very transparent, and I have enough faith in the intelligence of the average person to see right away that these posters are obviously either trolling or just little kids trying to stir the pot. Nobody is actually stupid enough to truly believe the things most of them say.
All this aside, I have seen this sub be helpful to many newcomers who have had questions regarding purchasing, storing and mining bitcoin, along with highlighting current development news. Nobody with millions in bitcoin is posting on here anyway, but for casual participants and even enthusiasts, it's not a bad sub to check in on. We'll never know the true intentions of the trolls, but they should remind us of how pathetic our lives could be. Imagine intentionally posting lies in a lame attempt to negatively influence someone for no personal gain whatever. That would be quite sad to live out.

Again, you are being hypocritical. I've held the same stance for years, and have been interested in bitcoin as a technology that works exceptionally well. Watching the inevitable growth of this peer to peer accounting and wealth exchange technology is great. Of course I invested in it, along with other things I think have potential. But as for the market manipulation, it's been like that for years dude - it's a natural byproduct of a new market that needs to mature. It's just price manipulation on the market, not bitcoin manipulation! You think it's worse now but with the additional players, regulations, and the distribution that comes with time, this will be less of a concern. If you're making money, go with it man, don't be on here whining for no reason.

BLOCKCHAIN IS THE BUBBLE.
  
I've thought this for a while and now I am hearing it being said more often. Here is a comment I posted summarizing my logic on this.  
Saying blockchain is the real bubble and not Bitcoin - It's like saying the endless list of companies that jumped on the dot com bandwagon, adding the dot com online portion of business to their model without any real implementation of it were a bubble, but some companies such as Amazon were the real deal.  
Very similarly, recently there was a wave of companies that added 'blockchain' to their business model and saw a surge in stock price only to crash again shortly after. There was also a wave of ICOs, raising millions on nothing but the concept of a blockchain project. But Bitcoin, the real original and functional blockchain, running stable with 99.99&amp; up time for 10 years and not one transaction compromised, is amazing.
  
I think many have been getting it wrong - Bitcoin is not the bubble, blockchain is. Bitcoin just had a bubble period in its price growth during the awareness stage in late 2017. It's still on the rise and only now beginning to see real progress in terms of infrastructure and real adoption.

I haven't seen an exact answer to this, but one thing that would make sense is that they bought up that low price range up from 3.2k last December to stock up. After all, Bakkt has been in the works for a while, and first announced it last August. I would think they sourced it from OTC, but they also may turn to exchanges when necessary, due to supply and demand. Then there's also the shorters who may provide some of the bitcoin that is being used as physical settlement. I'm sure they will eventually clarify all that!
@_date: 2019-08-14 04:32:03
Because other cryptocurrencies do not, and will not, have the combination of decentralization, universal application and security as their foundation. It took bitcoin 10 years to earn the confidence of developers who will build on top of its foundation for years to come. That's how solid protocols throughout history have positioned themselves as the core for endless future development. Particularly modern day protocols in the digital realm. You don't replace this, you build on top of it. Stable coins don't compete with bitcoin, they compliment it in a crypto ecosystem. It's already happening. I don't much care if bitcoin hits 8k or 18k in the short term. My background and history is in technology, and I'm looking at the big picture here.
The funny part is I had this exact conversation with people in 2015 and even last year when it was 3200. You need to look past the noise and clutter.
@_date: 2019-10-24 11:21:58
If bitcoin price stays at this level, buy it. If it drops to 5k, then I'd say buy it. If it pumps back up to 10k, well then you should buy it. Nothing has changed for those who are looking years ahead, and those who have been around 4 or 5 years understand this very well. I am not a financial adviser (buy it).

It's not crashing, the BTC price is doing what it's done for years, LONG before ICOs and these "shitcoins" you refer to. When selling is dominant, Bitcoin price drops, buying it rises. You don't need to always have a reason. That's the biggest problem with crypto, that some people always need to have a reason - tether conspiracy, hacked exchange, denied ETF, etc. NO - It's just buying and selling, and it's been like it since bitcoin has been traded.


That's because you always talk as though you have all the answers, but nothing you say lines up with reality. You change your "statistics" constantly (11% saturation of BTC buyers??!), you talk about alts and BS in bitcoin sub, you act as though you have made millions in this space and that you know it all - YET, you are barely even invested.

Actually Google trends show an increase in bitcoin related searches. But ... that being said, I have never put much weight in Google trends as a metric for bitcoin interest because what's trending is not a true indicator of interest in what may "not" be trending.

The closest Bitcoin can come to a payment system is an alternative system that runs along side fiat.  It will take generations to see Bitcoin replace fiat.
A store of value makes perfect sense. The value is in the incredible stability of the network, Not one single compromised transaction in it's 10 year run. Sounds like a hell of a safe place to store value and worth if you ask me. Can banks say that? The hardware and electricity used to mine and secure the transaction hold plenty of value.  What about when the next generation of digitally savvy investors come online?  
You can't compare Bitcoin to any other investment or currency, because it is both.

As I understand it, not until you convert your crypto to fiat, another crypto, or a product/service. Then you owe capital gains taxes on the amount it is worth in dollars over what you paid for it.

He has not been here that long. You don't talk like a child as he does,  and you don't bash an investment if you have made that kind gains on it. He sounds over the top pathetic. People like him just convince others to buy bitcoin without trying ..they see how hard these little kids try to be trolls and just get it lol.

I did this all year, and I'm only up in bitcoin by 16 times more than I am in all my stocks and other investments combined. Geez, I am such a sucker.
@_date: 2019-08-03 13:37:30
Do some research on the past 10 years, follow the developments, understand how the open source code is developed contributed and approved, and read up on the new money &amp; efforts being pumped into platforms, apps, onramps and infrastructure. There are a lot of scams out there and most of them make their payday with fiat. That doesn't make USD or any fiat a scam, and any scams that make a profit in  bitcoin doesn't make bitcoin itself a scam. Bitcoin is by far the most secure. Also, do you really think that the government would be creating regulations for a "scam"?
@_date: 2019-08-14 18:27:21
I've often wondered the same...about how long they've been playing around with bitcoin I mean. Plus we keep hearing about these big players who acted like Bitcoin was a bad word just a few years ago who now own loads of it, or have started a fund! A lot of people trying to pull the wool over us.
@_date: 2019-08-21 10:36:35
I'd have been happy with anywhere above 6k this soon. A lot of people who don't invest don't seem to comprehend how vast of a price increase it is for such a short time. But I never would have thought we would hit 10k this soon. Anyone following this space knows what's coming and the more time to accumulate the better. I'm not complaining that bitcoin is doing so incredibly well compared to pretty much all other investments on earth, but I won't complain if I have the rest of 2019 to accumulate either.
@_date: 2018-06-29 18:56:57
Dead again? Oh man I keep missing the death, that's like 300 times now. Oh well I guess you should sell it all at a loss instead of waiting to sell it on the next ATH. But wait, you're looking at a 6 month window and not a 10 year window, so you probably really believe that now .... after the vast infrastructure and global awareness, that it would actually go away? He he ... sorry man but anyone that's been watching this shit for a decade HAS to find that kind of amusing.
@_date: 2019-08-15 17:02:24
Not really. You see, Buffet seems to feel the same about both so this simply further supports that Bitcoin is digital gold.

@_date: 2019-08-21 17:32:07
\^ Exactly. You could pick any one year period from the past 10 years of bitcoin, and if you bought the same amount say every 2 weeks, based on today's price of 10k you would be up a significant amount of money. This makes bitcoin one of the best investments available on the planet.
@_date: 2019-08-15 17:41:46
Then by your own research, you feel the  Chinese Ponzi scheme has contributed significantly to this dip? Perfect! Personally, after surviving Mt. Gox, exchange hacks, the 2017 bubble, etc., this is a scratch and means nothing to me. I get that it damages global faith but in the big picture bitcoin's trajectory remains intact. It's noise that we will all forget about before the year is over.

@_date: 2019-08-24 17:38:07
Yes, if you are actively trading and timing the market and are successful, or if you hand off the management of it. Personally, the stress and time it takes to trade is no longer for me, and I prefer to cold storage and go with the higher probability of Bitcoin's rise in value over time. But one day in the not so distant future I do see a huge industry in key storage with loss coverage.
@_date: 2019-10-09 18:44:56
Fair enough ... there are some decent guys. In traditional stocks, I think TA is great. I just find Bitcoin so wildly unpredictable that it's difficult to really align TA to any trend other than a long term MA, if that makes sense?
@_date: 2019-08-22 01:31:58
Well if that's the case and it's like clockwork all traders would be making money on a schedule. But in any case if they have been dumping hopefully some of that BTC is being more widely distributed because it's obviously being bought.
@_date: 2019-08-18 20:50:24
Because we have the security needed. And now after a 10 year track record of proving its worth, there is enough confidence and processing power in the bitcoin network to build upon via layering. It's been proven to work with solid base layer protocols in the past like TCP, and we're only in the beginning phases of layering on the bitcoin protocol. We have the foundation, now it's time to build.
@_date: 2019-08-09 13:09:12
The same game is played with oil. A false perception of scarcity helps control the price. With bitcoin, there is no false perception of scarcity. Exact math dictates the supply and there will be no deception of how much bitcoin is out there.
@_date: 2019-08-12 22:11:39
Security is everything. The 10 year track record + the security is what makes bitcoin the foundation to attract future growth via layering and third party integration. This is how a solid secure protocol like TCP runs the entire internet. Cutting blocktime with all other variables of hardware and processing power remaining the same means a less challenging algorithm, which means less security. Why would anyone want to compromise the very fundamental value of the protocol when the speed and volume can come later?
@_date: 2019-08-14 23:35:59

You just answered your own question. When something is up 30% people often take profits. But many of us hold and DCA and grab up these dips when the opportunity presents itself. Also, it's quite normal to see some downward movement before we continue the climb. Patience is the best antidote for this market's volatility.
@_date: 2019-08-06 14:18:05
Wow, up $2,300 in 4 days! And the profit taking only retraced $700 down from $12,300. I like gains but I'd prefer this slows down a bit and grows over time. We don't need another bubble only to scare away the timid guys again.
@_date: 2019-08-13 19:51:43
Well, it has always moved like a snake up the hill. Just don't get too caught up in TA when it comes to Bitcoin. I watch trading view for stocks and it's often aligned with price movements. but Bitcoin? This shit can shoot up or down 20% like a shot out of the dark nobody saw coming LOL! I just buy it when I can.
@_date: 2018-06-28 11:19:35
You do? Ha ha ha, that's hilarious. You go ahead and feel bad, and stay inside your own world. Hope it's OK if a few of us grab some of this cheap Bitcoin though because although it may or may not drop a tad further, the long run looks pretty G damn prosperous. 
But hey, who cares what I think I know right?

I know you're joking, but the US can't ban bitcoin. Bitcoin is code, code is speech, and speech is protected. The United States Supreme Court has already opined on this.

A threat to the bitcoin of today, sure. The bitcoin of 10-20 years from now will look a lot different if the dev team continue their fine work.

The point is that as a value store, bitcoin does not need to be physically stored, guarded and accounted for. It is maintained by its own existence and is divisible, provides convenience of instant liquidity 24/7 and can be shared via the internet along with other modern day productivity and entertainment resources. It simply allows us to move forward with a value store that aligns with a digital society. The utility of gold in industry can remain.
@_date: 2019-08-24 11:33:43

Yeah, and we should have just given up on internet back when it was 56 kbit per sec because people tried watching video on it and realized it was too slow.

Obviously nobody knows if Hal Finney is/was Satoshi, but we know for sure he was very heavily  involved in the early stages of bitcoin development. Based on my time spent learning about this space, I feel that Hal Finney is the best version of Satoshi we could hope for.
Either way, both Finney and Kleiman are dead, and the 1 million Satoshi coins should probably be removed from the total supply. It even seems that Finney seemed to have considered this when he referred to the total supply as 20 million instead of 21 way back in early days. Anyone else here feel that Finney is their Satoshi?

Bitcoin will very likely bubble up and drop many times during the next few years. For the tiny percentage of people that got burned and turned there are still far more people who are only now considering a modest investment in the crypto space to catch potential of the next bubble.
Therefore, whether you are pessimistic or optimistic on Bitcoin price movement, you will eventually be right.

Google may have something in 10 years...that's a big maybe. They need to achieve entanglement of a large number of qbits even in theory to come close to breaking modern day encryption. Are you saying today's miners won't be upgraded once in the next 10 years? Twice in the next 10 years? How about 3 times? 4 times? So you really think the mining hardware to upgrade miners to be compatible with what will be a global requirement for ALL things encrypted will be an issue? What about bank accounts? Email? VPNs and all tunneling over internet connectivity? No...quantum computing is NOT a threat to bitcoin. If bitcoin can't even upgrade to scale with quantum, then what hope would it have to survive tech advancements that will inevitably occur over the next century? When people make quantum computing they will make quantum resistant technology to retain security levels. These things advance together, always have and always will.

It's fine just remember when you took the tape that already was being used, and then put it in a cassette player that was the exact same technology as the old player except it was...portable!! Nothing really new. Before that was 8 track and vinyl, after was Cd then streaming. Music can be transmitted over many mediums, but the protocol for music has been layered upon since it existed. Bitcoin's protol can be can be also layered upon and transmitted over any type of network. In fact no matter how computers (like the cassettes and vinyl) are advanced the protol can still be exchanged peer to peer. So bitcoin is like music!! Great comparison you just reminded me of. Thanks!

Not at all. In terms of 'Sats' (Satoshis), if fiat were not around, and things were valued in sats, then you could spend an increasingly smaller amount of sats to purchase the exact same item over time. It's just the opposite of inflation and we've just accepted that over time, the price of any given purchase in fiat will increase. We could easily adopt the opposite mindset in a deflationary, trustless global currency. The problem is, inflation allows governments and controlling entities to shift the supply to suit their needs and agenda. This can be beneficial in certain scenarios and devastating in others. It's the difference between funding a war, increasing your exports, and bailing companies out of a recession. But we're very adaptable as a species, I mean look how far we've come in the past few thousand years, specifically since the industrial revolution. I'm confident we could make it work :). For me though, in this time line, it's a value store and a damn good one!
@_date: 2019-08-22 13:05:32
Ha, well more of an observation. Every time the price stalls in a tight range there are a load of future tellers shouting that it's going to drop even more, making investors wait for further price decline that rarely happens. If you're looking long term, the best time to buy bitcoin is whenever you have some money you can afford to put in it.
@_date: 2019-10-23 15:26:16
Again? Fawk I can't keep up with the deaths. Though I have to say, you "bitcoin is dead" people are not nearly as vocal this past few years as you used to be. Which is frustrating because whenever people start calling bitcoin dead has been the very best time to buy more :).

You said below that you keep getting banned from this sub. The question is, why do you keep coming back?

A year lol. Ooohhh a whole year, what are we gonna do?! Come on man, any of us in this game for the long haul have been saying around the year 2025 since 2015. If you want fast moving wheels and the same volatility go play with pot stocks... grow it and distribute it, no tech infrastructure needed. Bitcoin is a long play and smart money is accumulating or trading the volatility... not complaining about monthly or yearly price swings.

Market manipulation and opportunists are not ponzi schemes. Bitcoin is a blockchain network based on open source software. Don't be another broken record of false claims of ponzi schemes and tulips. 
Even if you feel what's going on with the token price is manipulation, that doesn't make bitcoin itself a ponzi, that's just human greed taking advantage of an opportunity.

Holding isn't much good of you only bought once and then watch it go up and down for a year. If you DCA however, you buy small amounts once a week, 2 weeks, whatever, then you buy in at all price ranges and are rarely ever down money. Then as soon as the price goes over the average range you've been buying in you immediately see gains.
@_date: 2019-10-26 06:47:04

Ohhhh, OK I get it - you're a child. Well I tired anyway. Bitcoin is not going away. Agree, disagree, I could care less man. 
But you have to know on some level. If you really look at how some countries who can benefit from it the most have already adopted infrastructure to support it, and the massive efforts that the core developers are putting into the open source code to improve performance ,etc that this is just the very beginning. I'm not saying everyone should get rich, I'm saying this shit is not going away. Oh, and YES....100% YES history is an amazing teacher, and it does indeed indicate patterns that repeat.
@_date: 2018-06-24 23:23:54
People still calling Bitcoin the Myspace of crypto are just regurgitating crap they read on some BS clickbait article. Bitcoin will not be replaced anytime soon, simply because it has proven its network is stable and secure and it's been tested for 10 years...under the heaviest load that any crypto has endured. 
You don't replace that, you upgrade it. Layering technology and inovation will nurture Bitcoin well into the future IMO. The internet wasn't replaced ...it was improved! Same with Windows, Apple, Amazon etc. They evolved.
I guess that's more agreeing than debating but I've been following this a long time and I'm pleased to see that people like yourself are reason to believe that opinions are becoming more educated.
@_date: 2019-10-26 22:06:32
Of course not...with PCs. One of them is involved with a mining operation though, and it's quite elaborate. It's how tech evolves. Remember when you could create a website and make a fortune with affiliate marketing, sell domain names, or even more recently when you could use Facebook and Google Adwords for very cheap and generate business leads like it was nobody's business? You can still do all those things, but it's caught on that it's profitable, the space becomes more diluted, and this it requires far more expense and investment. Bitcoin's mining is a technology that requires more investment and effort to make money as more people get involved. There are countless mining operations and expect countless more to pop up as the tech evolves and energy innovation along with it. It will remain decentralized because even if a country funded mining, other countries will say we're not going to let that country monopolize this thing, and they'll do the same. It's still decentralized in that extreme hypothetical scenario because no one region or country will ever own bitcoin as their currency. It's global. 
As for manipulation, all market are manipulated, ALL! But the younger and smaller the market, the more impact manipulation will have. With patience and understanding, we will see the day when Bitcoin's price will be much more difficult to move. The main takeaway in all this is that these are very early days. I have lived long enough to know that when organizations like the NYSE get involved, it's because they know this thing is here to stay and going to be huge.
@_date: 2019-08-07 15:19:41

@_date: 2019-10-26 13:50:59
A lot of people made more gains in one day than they would make for a full year on the stock market. Few can resist taking some profit on that kind of gain, so naturally there will be some selling.  But I'd hardly call that a "pump and dump" as some people on here have been saying without even thinking. To jump from 7300 to 10500, and then settle somewhere around 9k is no pump and dump. There are a lot of unknowns in this move, but I guess we'll see what happens.
@_date: 2019-08-13 18:06:35

While anything is possible, next week is a bit ambitious lol. No worries though really, keep a 5 year time frame in mind with tech adoption and evolution. Bitcoin has gone from pennies to 6k in a decade and now only now are people really starting to pay attention. 
Read some in depth articles, listen to crypto podcasts, etc in the meantime. The more you learn about what's going on around the entire globe with bitcoin, and how much contribution is being made to the open source code of the network, the less you will worry about price. The day will come sooner than you even realize when the value of a single Bitcoin will be incredible.

I remember the first access to internet. Seemed like quite a hassle, tying up the phone line, dialing up sometimes multiple times to connect, and then waiting for ages to download anything of any size, etc. It took years and years to get DSL and then finally fiber and we are not near where we will be in another decade.
You get my point. Wallet address translation, functioning layers on the network, easier purchasing and storage, and much more will happen over the next few years.
You said Bitcoin has been around a decade right? Well that's the foundation that gives faith to build on. But remember until last year, most people didn't even know what Bitcoin was! Just wait and see what happens in the next few years. Bitcoin will get legs and walk, eventually run and shit will get real.

Then buy some at the lowest price you think it'll go. Now "that" would actually be a display of intelligence. Not guessing bitcoin price, which seems to hit pretty much every price within reason if you wait long enough.

Well you buy when it looks that way (It doesn't look fucked at all). Buy when things look the worst, that's how you make gains, and how we made gains from our buys last December.

Nobody knows, but of it were going to drop back below 11k in the near term, you'd think it would have done so yesterday and dropped below the support, instead of heading back up again.

Same reason they invest in other useless energy wasting things that had zero value until people collectively decided it had value. The same reason they play with futures contracts. 
The bitcoin network has value of course, and it's been talked about more than enough over the past decade, so if you don't get it by now, just forget about it. A global store of value, decentralized with multiple possible benefits ... but that's not what institutional investment cares about. At all. Not one bit.
@_date: 2019-10-16 17:20:57
DOS and 16 bit Windows that ran on top of it are actually great examples. Thus was the 80's so you must have barley caught the tail end of all that, although DOS was used a long time after that for other applications, networking and such. Great example though because tech doesn't often get replaced as many claim, it gets upgraded.

I'm just making an observation. I have no right to advise anyone else, and that's the point I guess. So many on here trying to suggest that they know how the price is going to move - nobody knows that. But based on history, both for bitcoin and most investments, the best time to buy is when negative sentiment is high. The best time to sell is when everyone is buying. Personally I just DCA so I can accumulate some BTC for what I believe is a future (5-10 years) where the price is far higher than it is now. The ups and downs between now and then don't mean a lot to me.

Correct, much cheaper if they achieve success based on current goals. However, currently the cost of producing even the basic workings of a machine is a few million dollars for parts and another few million dollars for labor. So the early released quantum computers that are available to the general public in the next 20+ years will probably come with a hefty price tag!
@_date: 2018-06-29 18:43:28


Ba hahha. You really believe this crap or are you just trolling. Bitcoin does this over and over because it's not only new, it's something that we need to learn how to deal with - both a currency AND an investment.Anyone that's been paying attention from the beginning is relaxed,  buying and will average down and then it will rise, and then likely fall again.It does NOT matter if it's $10 or $100,000, it's relative and it dropped almost 90&amp; a few years back. This is old news but many people here never even bought Bitcoin until a year (or less) ago lol.

Overnight? You think the years between now and quantum computing as a publicly accessible tech is not enough time for Bitcoin's development team to implement the upgrade?

@_date: 2019-10-24 11:32:35
Well ok, but when a tech has only fulfilled a very small percentage of its potential but contunues to grow for the first 10 years, and no reason for that growth to stop or slow, I'll bet on that continuing. You seem pretty confident so I'll assume you used to stress out with the rest of us back in the Mt Gox days and bitcoin really seemed dead days. Think about that for a second...regulations are a playground day compared to what bitcoin has already survived. Not the temporary price volatility...that will happen for several years sure. But the ides is to accumulate with money you can afford to lose so that if no critical system failure occurs, you can get a nice return over the next 5 to 10 years. It's not a retirement plan lol. It's a risky bet with a high potential for reward.
@_date: 2018-06-29 23:26:52
I don't disagree. Organic growth will render the impact of Futures manipulation as the people involved will become a much smaller piece of the pie. This seems kind of inevitable given the huge upward trajectory hat Bitcoin has been on this past 10 years. The only questions is how soon will more average Joe's want to own a small piece of the action for that 'just in case' moment and how soon will institutional investment start flowing in. I see this point of entry as attractive in terms of price, but public perception may need a little more time.
@_date: 2019-10-16 15:19:21
Of course not. Many believe that miners start holding their BTC after halvings, because the lesser supply generation versus stronger demand leads to an increased price. This way they can recoup some of the losses they incur when they start getting half the reward for the same investment and effort. You can't possibly bake that in like a stock price.
@_date: 2019-10-18 02:58:00
I don't think the bitcoin community would necessarily be the force of opposing it. I think it would be supporters of free speech and independence, etc. that would make it their cause too and back it with the Supreme court ruling. They know where that road would lead if government can start dictating the use of digital peer to peer data to that extreme. But hey man, I guess if they ever try to ban it we'll find out.
@_date: 2019-08-21 14:01:18
There are countless opinions on all this. For me, i see this as WAY too early to be able to use bitcoin that way in mass use, because the infrastructure just is not there yet. But it's happening. If I compare bitcoin and the crypto ecosystem now to when I first got involved, the difference is mind blowing. To buy bitcoin we used to have to jump through hoops. Now, I can open an app and in just a few clicks, own bitcoin or ether. Massive companies are only now getting involved, governments are acknowledging it, Layers like LN are being developed as we speak, and the security of the bitcoin network via hash rate is continually reaching new all time highs. Once bitcoin is used as a store of value mainstream, then we can worry about currency use. Once enough people hold somethings of value, the demand to make it easier to exchange it creates implementation and infrastructure to do so. These things take time, but as far as bitcoin goes, it's moving fast!!
@_date: 2019-08-05 15:46:15
No it has not, that's insane. Invest all initially depends 100% on timing, just as trading does. If you invested all initially in December 2017, you'd still be at a loss. Same if you'd done so recently when it hit over 13k. Sure, one day you should recover but DCA drastically lowers your average buy in, netting you more BTC and faster recovery from price drops.
@_date: 2019-08-09 01:32:48
Back when I first became interested in bitcoin, it was through a few friends of mine that mined it on what was the equivalent of a home PC. At first I was hesitant, and as they were explaining the basics to me, they said something that I am still reminded of by many people today - Financial professionals are mostly clueless when it comes to technology, and they will continue to challenge bitcoin on every front. Well, here we are years later and this remains the case. But there are those few rare cases where a few ambassadors for bitcoin are experts in both IT and economics. Listen to what these guys have say, and ignore the noise of one-sided complacency. We can not evaluate the future of this new technology based on old school economics. We need to think outside the box, because nothing like the hybrid entity of bitcoin has ever been here before.

@_date: 2019-10-16 12:32:25
Well no, but there's a fine line between profit taking and manipulation in a low volume market that has not yet matured. When the guys holding the heaviest stacks sell at low volume, the price is impacted significantly because selling fomo is triggered and the small market immediately reflects this in the price. Once a much larger number of participants are on board and value is attached to bitcoin on a main stream global level, there can easily be as much buying as there is selling at any given time drastically reducing the volatility. Whales take advantage of containing price for as long as they can, because buying low and selling high provides far more ROI and opportunity to multiply their investment in a somewhat controlled environment - where they can rinse and repeat.

POW is what makes bitcoin so secure. The cost of mining and the hash power. Take this away and there is no bitcoin. You want green bitcoin? Use clean, renewable energy to mine it. When people say that bitcoin is backed by computer processing power and energy, there's truth to it.

The BIS report was an obvious attempt to discredit Bitcoin and manipulate public perception.

@_date: 2019-08-21 17:14:44
Inform yes, but I never press anyone to buy. I usually end up focusing on the whole network value, digital gold, provides a solution as a trustless payment system, etc. I do go as far as making sure they are aware that nobody who invests with DCA over a reasonable period (about a year) has ever lost money in bitcoin, but that's where I stop. Because if someone invests money and takes a loss, they become bitter very quickly, and if there's someone to blame other than their own judgement, you fill that role.

That's just a natural beginning stage. All innovative technologies advance over multiple generations as they come out of the shadows and demand grows. The bitcoin infrastructure will continue to expand for many years to come. We didn't start out with 6 lane freeways, they came more than 100 years after the car was brought to us. Bitcoin needs at least a few decades before we really start seing its potential come into fruition.

365 contracts on bakkt today already up from like 20 or 30 some days. If you don't understand what that means in terms of where this headed as institutional investment becomes more and more common and as trust grows, then perhaps you need to look a little harder. To expect more than already is this soon is not rational. Trust takes time and familiarity. Give this about 5 years or so. We'll get there.

@_date: 2019-10-28 13:30:37
In the future? Depends on how long away you're referring to. It couldn't be more obvious that Bitcoin is being positioned as a value store and speculative investment when you look around at things like CME, Bakkt, Fidelity, hodlers, etc. But in time, once enough people own Bitcoin and the infrastructure is in place and layers are built on top of the Bitcoin protocol, I'd say there's a very good chance bitcoin will be used for transactions. The TCP protocol and the internet was too slow for things like cloud storage, Netflix and streaming, etc. for many years. Look at us now today. TCP was the foundation and we built on top of it with layers. Things take time - certainly a lot more than 10 years, but Bitcoin has already come further than we ever imagined in such a short time.

You had to block new user signups, scramble to address security issues, higher more staff than you ever prepared to have, and try to maintain a credible rep.

You pay taxes if you made money on it. NOT because you used it to make a transaction. It's capital gains, so if the bitcoin is worth more than what you paid for it when you exchange it, then you pay capital gains on the amount that it grew in value. People make a big deal out of it because they don't understand it. You're not being taxed because you used it, you're being taxed on your profit earned - IF there was a profit. If I work hard all day at a job and earn money, I pay a huge chunk of it to the government. And I worked hard for that. Yet we just accept that reality. But if we make money by clicking a few buttons to buy bitcoin and it doubles in value, and then have to pay taxes on the money we earned, we all complain about it. Yet that was WAY less work than the job scenario. Messed up world.
The only way we won't be paying taxes on bitcoin gains, is if its value were more of a constant and there were no gains to tax, or if everything is measured in bitcoin, for example if BTC became the reserve currency. So while anything is possible in a distant future, expect to pay taxes on your bitcoin gains, and be thankful you were able to make money that way as opposed to working hard on a 12 hour shift to make someone else money. Perhaps the tax laws will become more flexible one day, as bitcoin becomes used as much for a currency as it is for a speculative investment. Cryptocurrencies are nothing like traditional currencies, and the world needs to catch up in terms of how to deal with taxes on a currency that fluctuates wildly in value. But until then, don't expect to make money on an investment and not have to pay capital gains taxes on it, because it just isn't going to happen.
@_date: 2018-06-28 22:44:21
What you are saying is not common sense at all. You really think people who bought Bitcoin in hopes they'd double or triple their investment sold it because of speed or transaction fees? Really??
You're talking about Bitcoin like you just starting to get involved in it last year and expect the whole integration of Bitcoin to happen in a year lol. It takes way way longer than that, just as all disruptive tech has before. Bitcoin will almost certainly progress. And if you talk with developers who contribute to the open source code or look at how many times anything in the past has developed, you'll see that very little is ever accomplished without trying things and testing upgrades...because that's how you get it right..you fail a few times.
The other problem here is that you're evaluating the entire network and tech based on your emotional response to the price of the token. That's not common sense, that's not even sane.
@_date: 2019-10-05 23:58:21
Everything you say makes sense but the fact is that most people live check to check, and debt is at an all time high in North America. Also, many of the comments are from very young people and we were that young once. It takes time to become financially managed. One last thing - it's very common to contribute a portion of your pay to investments so that's also a reason for that type of perspective on buying bitcoin on payday for many people.

@_date: 2019-10-28 18:00:38
No tax requirements until you sell or exchange for a service, product or another concurrency. When you do this, you need to track the amount that your bitcoin has increased over the amount you paid for it. This is the amount you then pay capital gains tax on when you do your taxes for that year. As long as you just hold it, there are no taxes to worry about.

I know right? Comparing child porn to bitcoin is like comparing shooting an unarmed citizen and stealing their money to the legal possession of a gun collection owned for its value. But I wouldn't call the guy dumb, its just that many people are not aware of the laws in place, how they work, and what can and can not be done. Only for the insight I got from research attached to a large project I was a part of, I probably would not have been fully aware of the difference in what can be banned and what can be regulated. My main issue with above comment is trying to change to narrative to child porn, to question the credibility of the ones and zeros statement I made. That has nothing to do with bitcoin in any way!

A lot of people are waiting for the next price move, and few are acting during this sideways action. If you're not trading, and don't need the money in the short term then there's not a lot to be concerned with. Just accumulate an amount that you want to own through DCA and  if you believe that bitcoin's potential is going to be fulfilled within the next 5-10 years you can enjoy the reward from your patience then.

There's a hell of a lot more to look at than the market price if you're in this for the future as bitcoin continues to go viral.

Technically, every time you exchange your bitcoin for something else, you are supposed to pay capital gains taxes on the amount that bitcoin increased in value over what you paid for it. So if you paid $100 for bitcoin, and then when you exchanged that amount of bitcoin for a product, service or some other investment, it was worth $130, you owe capital gains taxes on the $30. 
This varies among different country's laws of course. For example in Canada you only pay capital gains on 50% of your gains, so in the above scenario you'd pay the taxes on $15.

Well for starters, there is the Lightning Network. You can do some research to dive into all this but the bottom line is that bitcoin can be slow and chunky if that's what makes it solid and secure. The layers added over the years to come can address speed and volume.

For anyone that says bitcoin can not become "digital gold" because gold has been around for thousands of years, they are missing a very simple fundamental point. It doesn't matter that gold has been around for thousands of years, because the internet just got here. And the internet changes EVERYTHING. We have transfered pretty much everything thay can be shared, streamed and distributed to the internet and it would be crazy to think that the world won't jump on a peer to peer decentralized open source digital store of value that can not be controlled by any one entity. Efficiency wins, and when it comes to 24/7 access/ liquidation with ease of transfer and exact supply to evaluate the supply and demand ratio, gold does not stand a chance against bitcoin in this new digitally connected society. I give gold a few more generations at most before bitcoin consumes its market share.

That's because once the experience is smooth, and the infrastructure to actually pay for things on a mainstream level is implemented, bitcoin will be insanely higher than 10k. It's only 10k because we are in such early days. 
Cars needed roads, trains needed tracks, internet needed protocols, packet switching, routers, etc., Netflix needed bandwidth and widespread access to the internet. Bitcoin is in the process of being synced with society via onramps, apps, layers and third party platforms. These things take a lot of time, just as they did with the above mentioned, but it's abundantly clear that they are well underway with the bitcoin ecosystem. Ten years from now things are going to look quite different.

You can't hack a cold wallet, clone away. And bitcoin isn't ready for mainstream currency yet. Store of value is there though and it's sick strong security, 24/7 liquidation and way more suitable for today's world. Currency in my opinion maybe by 2030 ...as a real start. It will be many years after that evolving though. Protocol building is a slow process, even slower to adopt as people's trust grows over each year. We'll get there! There have been people saying what you're expressing since day one and they'll keep saying it for years. That's good, it's quality assurance and keeps the standards high. Pessimists play a far bigger role than just annoying optimists.

Anyone predicting price is talking out of their ass yes, that goes for predicting increases and drops. But if you keep it simple, bitcoin has been around for 10 years and the money being invested into it's mining and infrastructure continues to increase. There's absolutely no reason "as of yet" for bitcoin to stop increasing in price over the years to come.

It's funny, you say that as though you don't acknowledge the massive gains made in BTC in the past decade. You did say invest where the most can be made right? 
Anyway, your approach on stocks is not wrong, but you can't put bitcoin in the same basket as stocks, and even the rest of the crypto market. If you think in terms of technology, you appreciate the protocol as much as the investment, and realize that bitcoin does not belong in the stock category. The foundation, track record and the security have been established. Whether you see it as your crop or your weed, Bitcoin is going viral fast. The spinoff industry has been insane and we are only in the preliminaries. Invest without bias in your stocks, sure. I know I do. But bitcoin is far bigger than the financials of a single company. This is a base level protocol that can be layered to serve endless roles in global finance. There's no cheerleading in opening your eyes and seeing what's already there. You think too small.

This below is what Warren Buffett said back in 1998. That was before high bandwidth internet and bitcoin. Now that we can liquidate with a few clicks and have an exact number of supply of a global peer to peer digital value store, maintained with perfect math (well close to perfect), how long do you honestly think it will be before bitcoin dominates gold? it's just a matter of time. Hold tight! Gold's market share is incoming.

Hmmm, you're stuck. Bitcoin is way more than just a gold alternative. Everything that most other alts do can be integrated into bitcoin via layering. As I tried to explain, the decade of surviving with no network downtime and no compromised data is an absolute necessity to bring programmers to the next phase where it is now worthy as a foundation to build these layers on. It's had the test phase and proven itself. The replacement you refer to can never catch up. I mean at least for the foreseeable decades anyway. You don't replace a proven foundation, you build on it.

If you wanna play that price game and trade and be stressed out over that shit, it's anyone's choice to make. Bitcoin's not going anywhere, there's too much money pumped into all the industry built...and being built around it. As soon as we reach a point where there's no barriers to entry, and anyone tech savvy or not, can buy it and store it easily and also trust that it's the real deal and see past all the fud from hacked exchanges and scams the price will explode. Either you're ready for that day or you're not. I can tell you right now it's NOT going to be tomorrow. It's going to be years. But you'll wish you had bought below 10k because this price is not going to last.

Or that Canda would legalize pot coast to coast?! These same guys would tell you you're crazy, just like they're doing now.  Bottom line, these are not the people who move the world or change the world in any way.

We've all been aware of this stage of evolution involving government, manipulation, regulations, etc., that is an inevitable part of the process that bitcoin has to go through as it integrates with society. It's playing out like a book, where  everything we've discussed over the years is coming into fruition. There's just no way to get to mass adoption without overcoming these challenges. It takes time, and the longer bitcoin is around and remains a solid secure protocol worth layering on top of, the more it will slowly earn the trust of the people. There are still older folks who don't trust making a purchase online. These things require generations before mass adoption is acquired.

Regardless of what anyone predicts, it is definitely only a guess. There's absolutely no way to predict the price any more than it is to predict stock prices or winning lotto numbers.
So, best to ignore them and let them amuse themselves with the guessing game. No harm done.  We can all agree that after 10 years and still thriving, the end result is a continuation of growth, but what price it gets to, and what price points it hits along the way is impossible to know.

Funny, that exact same thing was said countless times over the past 10 years about every price range that bitcoin traded in, and it was wrong every time (and no, the few days that it spiked up to 20k is not a measurable trading range... it was a short lived spike and that's all).

Just open a broader lens and relax. Bitcoin will first go dense in the countries that benefit the most from it. Then, placed under a load for another while, the developers will work out upgrade implementations like all open source software, and it will eventually make its way into more and more mainstream financial operations.   
The biggest problem with all of this is that people expect way too much too soon. The internet started with military in the 60's and took years to finally make it's way into mainstream use and then years more to accommodate large file transfers and now look at it. Bitcoin also starts with a niche group, and as it becomes more accessible and user friendly we'll be using it before you even realize.  
However, that being said, if you look at the investment more than the currency, you'll focus on the day to day token price and go mad. Hold it, buy more if you have money you can risk and wait it out. Only a fool would think Bitcoin is going away in terms of advancement over time.

From Dec of last year to March of this year, bitcoin ranged between 3-4k. So many people wish they'd bought more then, but many did not because at the time there was constant talk of it going lower. Same goes for all sideways movement periods. If you're waiting now because of all the click bait BS articles talking about it dropping to 8k, 6k, etc, you may again miss out on getting Bitcoin at current prices and wishing you'd bought more. 
It doesn't always pay to wait. Just DCA and remember: These news articles, trolls, naysayers etc., are all looking for your attention. Also, negative price news gets clicks, and clicks generate ad revenue. That's how MSM works. Follow current developments and if the fundamentals remain strong (which they most definitely do), all price news is speculation. Don't miss an opportunity to buy when there's a price dip. DCA!!
@_date: 2019-08-23 23:05:02
Typically the price increases 12-18 months after a halving to reach a new ath, followed by a drop to a new, but higher, low. The last halving happened in July, 2016 but it wasn't until 2017 that we saw a big increase in price which ran throughout the entire year, and fell back to a much higher low.
This is not just saying history will repeat either because there's logic to it. If the reward miners get for the same investment and effort is cut in half, but the tech continues to evolve and the demand continues to grow, then the demand increases far faster than the supply - skyrocketing the price. Miners hold this lower reward and when the price skyrockets, they take their profits which can trigger a sell off, dropping the price to level off at a higher bottom.
This time around may be quite different due to higher public awareness and institutional investor interest. If financial institutions place big positions, it could accelerate the whole thing. One thing is for sure: Bitcoin is NOTHING like a stock where news is priced in. Bitcoin's price is a reaction to supply and demand.
@_date: 2019-10-29 13:07:54

We only know that with the exception of a few very short lived spikes such as what happened in 2017, the price continues to establish a higher average year after year. It's a long game and will take years to reach mass adoption...but a game that has proved to definitely be worth playing.

There has, and the fact that Bitcoin continues on is a great signal of it's robustness. The power of a global currency is incredible and before long many of the possibilities for application and benefit of Bitcoin will be realized. You see signals that your country's currency is going to drop in value soon ..move it to a global hedge and retain that value. Or in the case of Bitcoin, potentially increase that value since Bitcoin has most likely taken the heavy hits and changing direction very soon. Remember, most people didn't even know what Bitcoin was a year ago. The awareness stage is only now upon us. Can you even imagine 5 years from now??

You are missing these points:
* TA has almost always been completely wrong for predicting future bitcoin price movement. The market is new, the volume is still low enough that the price is easily moved by large sells/buys from big players (TA can't account for a huge red or green candle that appears by surprise and moves the price by 2k in half an hour)
* The market is rapidly changing and the environment and conditions are completely different than they were in 2017.

Because they're imaginary. The only realistic prediction is that based on the increasing amount of investment being poured into bitcoin infrastructure and mining, there will continue to be an increase in demand "over time". The key is to be realistic about the "over time" part of that statement. This is money and financial infrastructure we're talking about, not a new iPad or OS. It takes years, not weeks. And bitcoin has already overcome what many expected to be impossible odds. To think that this growth would stop now, when bitcoin has finally built confidence in the robustness of its protocol, would be absurd. 
Logic dictates that now that we are seeing new onramps, ideas for second layers, sidechains, attention from governments, etc, future growth will continue. The price will catch up, particularly after another halving of the miner rewards and new supply. It's basic supply and demand.
@_date: 2018-06-18 18:12:45
I guess the basics of it is that all Alt coins are valued in Bitcoin, not in any country currency. So, if the value of Bitcoin changes in terms of what it's worth in say USD for example, then the value of alt coins change relative to the move. They don't change much in terms of how much Bitcoin it costs to purchase them, unless they have something going on in terms of the alt coin's success, adoption, partnership etc.

If you lack perspective of what's clearly happening,  you have nobody to blame for missing the opportunity but yourself. By the way, I'm no kid. I was investing traditionally for years before bitcoin was a thing. I simply jumped on board what is obviously a tremendous opportunity.

To anyone who truly believes bitcoin will play a large role in the future of global finance and will continue its path of going viral as it has for a decade, this means nothing.
@_date: 2019-08-21 13:41:21
What would be the point of holding something of value, if you don't eventually exchange it for something valuable? People hold bitcoin because the past decade shows us how rapidly it is increasing in value, and they want to be able to exchange it for things of value down the road. Bitcoin can succeed as a store of value just fine. In fact, it may prove to be the most efficient store of value the world has even seen.

Ok, that's much more civilized. For a second there I was thinking that if you let me.. some stranger on the internet... make you that upset, then bitcoin will own you like  a bitch.
I don't disagree with CME trading impacting price, and I'm sure that with enough money it's possible to manipulate a small market like Bitcoin, sure. I don't however believe that the  CFTC, the Treasury, and the SEC manufactured the whole thing to bring down bitcoin, not even for a second.  I don't care how many click bait articles you link, you're not proving that conspiracy. You give them far too much credit. I believe the CME futures were created for a much more powerful and simple reason - to make money.

That's a bit of a premature perspective, but as bitcoin is now it would be too volatile yes.
@_date: 2019-08-05 13:54:48
It's common sense really. Soon, they'll only be receiving half the bitcoin for the same investment and efforts, so naturally there's going to be a big push on mining efforts to earn the current reward before it gets cut in half. Great for hodlers because this will contribute significantly to the network value in the big picture, which becomes reflected in the price.

Dead cat bounce already happened. Look at the chart, it's probably the most clear cut dead cat bounce you'll ever see. Hell, they could use an image of that one to insert next to the definition of dead cat bounce lol. In any case, hopefully it may be upwards from here for a while.

Because they're not afraid of cash, they've known it all their lives and have an intimate relationship with it. Sure they may have thought futures would pop the bubble, but that doesn't mean they ever worked together to carry out that agenda. The price had to correct it was massively over over inflated with a too much, too soon scenario.
@_date: 2019-10-14 03:39:53
Yeah, like TCP. Like bitcoin, it was a protocol that many said would never scale and was considered pretty crappy and assumed it would be replaced. They layered on top of it because it proved to be a solid over time and now it runs the internet. The bitcoin of 10, 20, 30 years from now will look a lot different from the first version for sure, but make mo mistake, bitcoin is not going away.
@_date: 2019-08-14 17:56:51
Well, I did have this exact discussion with many forum users in 2015, and the acceleration of bitcoin's viral integration has never really slowed down. In 2013 people were talking about buying a bitcoin every paycheck, and I was the one doubting. So I mean, really anyone who has lived through the process of seeing things go mainstream, and have some appreciation and comprehension of the time line required can see that bitcoin is going viral. A lot of the kids on here simply expect too much too soon. They'll appreciate the pace in due time.
@_date: 2019-10-04 13:11:44
It's something to YOU and that's what matters. If you keep a level perspective and understand how slow the wheels of financial infrastructure chnage move...the  10% of a bitcoin may very likely be something you'll be very thankful to own one day.

I agree. I have never once made a specific prediction other than... it's going to continue going up with spikes and dips along the way. That user has openly said he bought bitcoin at the ath, and has been calling it a bear market ever since 2017, despite over 300% gains for 2019. That's some messed up logic right there.
@_date: 2019-10-18 11:10:04
For fawk sakes guys, once you see these kids come on here going on about moving averages and regurgitating crap they watched in some trading video on YouTube, you know it's a good time to buy. The dumbest ones usually go extreme and call drastic drops like they did when we were at 3200...which was also a good time to buy. After large corrections they keep calling for more selling, because they're reading it on clickbait and watching it on amature videos and believing that crap. All I know, is if there was actually anyone who knew the future, they would not be wasting  their time on this sub trying to convince you to sell your bitcoin lol.

@_date: 2019-08-21 14:22:06
Well, I see it first as value store and then as an "alternative" currency. Fixed supply encourages saving more than spending. Based on today's mindset, spending stimulates economies, but we are in dire need of a trustless payment option that spans globally without any control or manipulation from a single country or entity. This all needs to happen over generations, not a few  years. If i own a business, I want people spending, I want job creation, etc. But if over a long period of time, and significant advancement in infrastructure, etc, a fixed supply currency went mainstream, perhaps it could replace inflationary currencies! If a small fraction of a bitcoin is worth the same as a large amount of fiat, and you pay me for my product or service, I still get the value for my business, and you still get to "save" the majority share of your holdings as you spend increasingly smaller portions of your bitcoin for your day to day expenses. It's difficult to wrap our heads around a deflationary currency because most literature and education is based around the current structure of inflation. Only time will tell! Worst case scenario, bitcoin is looking like a solution for countless finance related applications. We can layer it endlessly now that the robust foundation has been established.
@_date: 2019-08-06 12:52:34
It's still over 2k higher than a few days ago. This isn't a crash just the reality that the price isn't able to climb endlessly straight up without some selling.
@_date: 2019-08-18 05:22:56
I guess if you go back to 2010 with any reasonable amount of money, you can just buy up a load of bitcoin. Is it a one way trip? If so, sell along the way in Dec 2017, and buy it again Dec 2018, and back to now a very rich man!
@_date: 2019-08-05 12:26:33

@_date: 2019-10-16 10:49:34
If you were really here since 2014, you'd have gone through periods of sideways price like this before. The manipulation of a small market is not something that can be prevented but if more and more people buy in, manipulation becomes less and less. I've always said that around the year 2025 things should really kick in, and people would say that was ridiculous, but I still feel that way today. The day will come when the buying will kick in so hard, whales sill not be able to contain the price any longer. It's so easy to see it coming, and it's enabled by simplifying the process to get onboard. People outside the tiny crypto community still don't want to mess with exchanges, wallet addresses, and cold storage, but things are changing and bitcoin is becomming a more common part of the financial conversation globally. Trust is growing and continues to as long as bitcoin sticks around.
@_date: 2018-06-29 00:08:08
Look, NOBODY makes real gains from jumping on board when there's no risk. It's when it's scary and most people wouldn't touch it with a ten foot pole that you buy, not when it's all smooth sailing and a comfortable decision. By then it's too late.

First of all, quantum computing is a long ways off. Secondly, by the time quantum computers are implemented all other technology will have had time to catch up, including bitcoin. And yes, if quantum computers are unleashed then that's what we'll be using to mine... a more complex algorithm.
There's no risk if quantum computing taking down our security because these things happen  over time. It would be like during WW1 if people said future stealth fighters could wipe out the enemy and win the war in a day.

Agreed. 11 years ago it didn't exist. What was a tiny project is now a serious contendor valued at thousands per coin. It doesn't  matter if the price spiked here and there on hype and fomo, that's just a part of the discovery process. 20k, 5k, who gives a shit. Focusing on price fluctuation (which is expected as we try to valuate this thing) only to ignore the fact that this is an explosive and disruptive entity means overlooking the growth in the space and surrounding infrastructure. That would be both passive and ignorant.
@_date: 2019-10-16 15:34:19
By the time people catch on to what this is, it will be too late to buy in at the "opportunity" level. The opportunity to make the insane gains of the first few years is gone yes, but the opportunity to still do very very well exists. As I explained in a comment below, most people alive today have never experienced disruptive technology like this outside of the internet itself - and anyone under 40 probably don't remember life without the internet. So, recognizing bitcoin for the disruption that it is can be very difficult for many. What we are experiencing with bitcoin only happens once in a lifetime for most, and by the time most people realize just how massive it is, it will be too late to get in on the investment because when the price does explode it is going to happen fast.

I don't see how that would make any impact at all. Miners upgrade their hardware very regularly. Consider how many mining machines they've gone through in recent years. Not to mention they'd have plenty of time to fit the next planned computer upgrade with the quantum resistant hardware that everyone everywhere will be phasing into. Not an issue in the tech world where hardware upgrades are more like a routine.
@_date: 2019-06-20 22:07:31
It'll happen. It might take a few cracks before it breaks through and holds, but it'll happen because so many expect bitcoin to rise they are buying...and buying is what makes it happen. As people jump on board when they realize how far this thing is going to go with next year's halving approaching fast, FOMO will be off the charts.

I mean it's your debt to carry, but you asked so an honest answer is the best anyone can give you. In general, it's never recommended to go into debt to invest. I'm as confident as anyone that bitcoin is going to be worth far more than it's previous ath one day, because technology with a foundation like bitcoin's past decade doesn't just stop evolving. However, nobody can say how long that will take.

@_date: 2019-08-21 16:00:21
The crypto market has not failed, it is thriving. Don't be deceived by a down turn, while new exchanges open and the top performing alts like Etherium prepare for POS and investor rewards (if they hold at least 32 ETH). Other alts such as Vechain and Ripple to barely scratch the surface also have enormous potential via partnerships and development. I stick to bitcoin but can't deny the growth of this new crypto market, A vast number of alts will serve speculative investing as being equivalent to penny stocks, but there's a demand for that too. The more exchanges that open, the more likely the crypto market is to thrive. This last year or so is no way to judge - give it another 5 years or so and then make your assessment.

Bcash was excreted out of BTC 2 years ago and hasn’t had an ath since Jan 2018 when Coinbase picked it up. It was almost instantly obliterated. It's time to make it a tiny footnote in the history of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-08-09 13:24:39
First of all, kudos for moving forward to accept bitcoin as payment and contributing to the adoption! As for the coinbase, Libra, etc., I think we all just need to accept that there will be endless spinoff developments in the crypto space. Something as disruptive as bitcoin will inevitably have a resonance and impact as other projects jump on board. This does not take away from bitcoin in my opinion, because these other developments will not have the decentralization and security to fill the role that Bitcoin plays. Currency use may be further down the road but many innovations end up as solutions for different problems than they were initially conceived to be. Right now, speculative investing like gold, and store of value use case is strong. As developments like LN and additional layers evolve over the years, bitcoin can fill endless roles.
@_date: 2019-08-15 15:13:19
Exactly. OP does not understand how things work with hedging. It's either before, or a while after other assets, stocks, bonds, whatever take a hit. NOT during same time or right away. If you wait until value of one asset drops before storing value in a hedge, that's not a hedge lol! Now if you decide that the first asset(s) are not recovering, and then choose to hedge, that's a common scenario (the 2008 example you provided above). Mostly though, these are very early days for bitcoin. People need to have mainstream on ramps, and they are coming in due time.
@_date: 2019-10-26 21:01:17
No but as technologies evolve, there is a very high likelihood that it will go on for a very long time. The early days of 1000x returns are gone forever. But this is still early as layers are being currently being developed to integrate on Bitcoin's protocol, and extremely good profits are still possible until it becomes easy for the mainstream public to trust and get onboard. Think online purchases... there are still some folks who don't trust purchasing via internet transactions. 20 years ago, hardly anyone trusted buying online. It takes time.
@_date: 2019-10-29 16:15:31
Lol, just looking at your post history - it's like you fell asleep in 2014 and just woke up. It never ceases to amaze me that there still people like yourself who are not able to take a look around and observe what's happening. The days of buying Bitcoin for a few dollars and making 1000X returns are long gone but it's still very early when you take a deeper look at development progress of the protocol. There's no "Bitcoin protocol replacement" coming, just like there was no TCP protocol replacement. Bitcoin is being built upon, and the millions being pumped into the surrounding infrastructure solidify the progression.

That's nothing. You can trade these moves or hold for 3 years and double, triple, or even quadruple your money. It's a win win. If you're worried about 1 or 2 years then you're in the wrong game as a long term investment. All the gloom and doom crap is a waste of time. There's loads if investment opportunities out there... granted nothing returns like bitcoin if you have 3-5 years. But pick your investment and don't waste your time and energy.

What about the people that bought it a year ago? 5 years ago? People that are buying it now? If we are looking at Bitcoin we have to look at the whole picture, not just the hyped stage. People who never even heard of it started jumping on board all at once and inflated the price and those who bought it long before that have been taking profits. That's not a scheme or a ponzi or anything odd or unexpected. Bitcoin will most likely continue on with its growth and this will be but one tiny piece of the timeline.

Up to now for the past year, one could sell and buy it back cheaper if they were lucky enough to strike the right timing, but it's moving too fast now. You'd have to be moving a lot of bitcoin to make any decent gain with these small dips, and then then you'd be risking a lot too. There's probably going to be a lot less selling now.
@_date: 2019-06-27 20:39:40
"Back up" would only refer to whay happened for a couple of days. Overall the price movement is up. Unless you're day trading, who really cares? I'm not stressing out over trying to sell every peak, that requires sitting and watching,  trying to time the market. Just cost average with a little purchase here and there and watch your money grow over the years. Bitcoin's obviously not going away.
@_date: 2019-10-23 20:36:02
Not related. There have been a few developments today that some think may have impacted the price, involving Libra and BitMex liquidation. But bakkt is not one of them. Physically settled futures are far more positive for the space than cash settled, but it will take a lot more time.

Same reason why we didn't replace TCP, which was pretty limited in the beginning. Like TCP, Bitcoin is a protocol that has proven itself to work exceptionally well. Today TCP runs the entire internet because it was worth building on top of. Bitcoin has the track record of 10 years proving itself as a solid foundation. Layers are being developed to run on top of Bitcoin and there's no reason why this will stop. No other crypto has that track record and certainly no other crypto has the security that Bitcoin offers.
When you have a solid, tested and efficient protocol you don't replace it. You build on it.

It should eventually become more difficult for whales to impact price but until the market matures, large buys will certainly impact price because of the percentage of the whole.

Lol, you mean if you started the line in Dec 2017? Bitcoin has a much longer story to tell than a couple of weeks out of 10 years. Bitcoin has been below 10k for most of its existence. If you study a chart of your heart beat over the years, and there was a only a couple of small blips where it spiked, due to some out of the ordinary excitement or anxiety you experienced, would you judge your heart health on those spike blips or on the other 98% of the time?
@_date: 2019-10-14 03:57:34
Yes that is true. If you bought the same amount of bitcoin every week for the past 4 years, you'd have bought it WAY more often at below 8k than above it, and would be in the green right now. Same can be said for any 4 year period since Bitcoin's inception if you pick any current price and look at past 4 years. 
How can anyone possibly think that's going to change now going forward - when bitcoin has more infrastructure growth, more investment in mining, more exchanges, apps and onramps to make it easier than ever before to buy bitcoin, along with stronger fundamentals for potential use cases via to second layer and sidechain implementation? It's a no brainer if you sit back and think about it. This thing is only finally getting off the ground.
@_date: 2019-10-28 13:22:38
ALL markets are manipulated to some extent, but there's more than just manipulation driving price moves. Shorts getting liquidated, bots, buy and sell orders get triggered, and a lot of money on the sidelines jumping in as FOMO gets triggered in both directions. Also, the younger and smaller a market is, the more impact manipulation will have. Once Bitcoin's market matures, the effects of manipulation will be smaller and the price will be harder to move. Take your position and enjoy the ride I say!!
@_date: 2019-10-16 13:40:55
if you need resources to be semi-liquid then you are not going to DCA into an investment, that's a given. But to your point about DCA only working in scenarios where price is rising over time I don't agree. DCA actually protects you in environments where the price is NOT rising constantly, that's the whole point. If the price fluctuates up and down and never passed a particular high, if you DCA then worst case scenario you at least stay even and don't lose money. The only risk is if the price crashes and never recovers, but hey - that's always a risk I suppose.

Its really difficult to explain the concept to anyone who has had no exposure to bitcoin. Today's new younger generation are growing up with bitcoin, and once they are the  mainstream buyers and sellers, business owners and politicians, etc, bitcoin will be mainstream. Try explaining 3D printing to an 80 year old. Try explaining machine learning,  etc. 
The reality is, most people won't grasp the concept of bitcoin even when they start using it. Almost everyone has a smart phone. How many of them can explain how it works?
All you can do is tell people that just like music, movies, and data of all variations is now streaming content, money will also be streaming content. Highly divisable, highly secure, and self maintained without the need for a middle man. Eliminating the moving parts and masssive verification expenses of today's currencies is reason to see how bitcoin will grow. Efficiency usually wins in the tech world.

It's an ecosystem. I'm pro bitcoin as much as anyone but without the alt, this market would not have gotten where it is today.

Many of the most disruptive technologies on earth gained mass adoption for something completely different than what they were initially "supposed to be". Governments won't outlaw BTC, even if they could. The money governments are making from this is astronomically higher than most people seem to have caught on to. They are approving more and more business in the space and infrastructure, a fact that seems to be oddly left out of the main stream media and crypto conversations. There has been an initial 2 or 3 decades to every great tech in history where discovery and advancement are just getting off the ground. Most people alive today have never experienced this outside of the internet itself - and anyone under 40 probably don't remember life without the internet. So, recognizing bitcoin for the disruption that it is can be very difficult for many. What we are experiencing with bitcoin only happens once in a lifetime for most, and by the time most people realize just how massive it is, it will be too late to get in on the investment because when the price does explode it is going to happen fast.

Exactly, their circuit focused architecture. Think of how registers in early CPUs made certain CPUs much more effective for some tasks...only now with ASIC the machine is designed with circuits soley for a specific task. Not sure how that makes a difference. Quantum computing doesn't hold a candle to some of the other challenges bitcoin will face over the next 50 years or so. It's just a planned roll out. Once they have the quantum resistant chain ready, they can start a countdown...in 300 days we will be switching to new chain..

Libra fell apart because it can't do what bitcoin can do. And that's to function completely independently without a controlling entity that all liability would fall upon. None of the big boys want the burden of that liability. Seems like all the content floating around about this latest Libra falling apart news whispers the backstory that bitcoin is indeed in a category of its own. I'd flag that as bullish.

Yes, it's an open source dev community, and HELL yes - quantum resistance is already in the works, although I wouldn't take the whole quantum threat as much of an issue in these early times. There would be ample time for roll out of the required hardware and software if needed going forward. The Google progress in quantum computing is worth celebrating as an achievement, but nowhere near the point of breaking modern cryptography. The articles and news about this has always been overstated because it generates clicks and ad revenue. Consider how many things in our digital society is protected via encryption, and how many things would be at risk if encryption were to be easily cracked by a quantum computer.
It's very interesting though, that for all the amazing things we could accomplish with quantum computing in medicine and a slew of other areas, that most of the news around this mentioned bitcoin to get readers. That speaks volumes to just how interested the world has become in bitcoin.

I wouldn't be so sure about that. These are times when a hedge like Bitcoin may be the perfect alternative for many. Especially now that it is at bottom prices. It lines up perfectly!  
A weaker Chinese currency in the months ahead would be a time that Bitcoin's store of value property could start looking a lot more attractive.
@_date: 2019-10-24 18:15:16
Fact: There is more money pumped into the bitcoin infrastructure and mining right now than ever, with new mining facilities being built at a rate like never before.
Fact: The hash rate, which provides the security, which along with the trustless exchange and decentralized attributes is why bitcoin blows any of these other centralized projects you mentioned out of the water...is higher than it has ever been in history as of yesterday.
Fact: Every day that bitcoin is still here, still never hacked, and still returning a higher average yearly value, is another day of trust and familiarity that is added to the general public.
Fact: you're baseless claims are full of shit.
It's a slow climb to mass adoption, but Bitcoin's fundamentals have NEVER been stronger. The volatility on the speculative market is business as usual, and doesn't mean a thing as long as the growth in every area that matters is there.

People are going to take profits young man, that's common sense. Do you realize that even if this settles at 8500, that's over a 1k jump in a day?? 
Look, I'll put it to you simple: The very fact that there's enough action in this space to see the price move we just had, along with a 1000% increase in institutional interest in bakkt, is more than enough evidence to solidify the FACT that you couldn't possibly be more wrong. In a very odd way I feel a little sorry for you because your posts scream resentment and desperation.

The biggest difference I've observed when I first entered the crypto space after only traditional investment experience, is that most stocks are limited (within reason) to the gains that can be made. There's still speculation, but most prices are a reflection of company financials. Crypto, bitcoin specifically, has an enormous ceiling and its price potential is based more and more on the math ratio of how many people there are to still jump on board to the supply. In short, the potential of how high this thing can go in comparison to traditional stocks is ridiculous.

Hey, it seems pretty normal to me. If you believe that in 5 years, 10 years, whenever, that bitcoin is going to be worth much more, than naturally you like getting more of it for your money now. Nothing wrong with that! The infrastructure is strong, the security is strong, and the community is strong.

What bitcoin is, how it works and the continued growth in it's ecosystem are all still very intact.

Bitcoin is easier to buy, many expect a lot of price gain leading up to the halving next year, bitcoin is far more well known, LN and developments in the space have increased confidence in its future potential, any disappointment in Bitcoin's use as a currency has been overshadowed by its potential as a value store - the gold of the crypto world, projects like Facebook's new crypto are legitimizing cryptocurrency as a very real part of the future economy, etc. 
Mostly though? More participants seem to expect the price to rise far greater and far faster these days so selling is perceived more and more of a risk than buying.

I work with tech every day, hell my whole life is tech. AOL is a company that profited from helping to deliver the internet and make it accessible. I guess if you had to make an analogy, you could say AOL was to internet as Exchanges are to Bitcoin. The internet started in the 60s and most people never even heard of it until years and years later. Bitcoin is very much like it. Ask anyone who contributes code to the core. 
And seriously man, like no disrespect but you gotta stop saying it failed because it didn't deliver in December or whatever. I mean that was less than a year ago. You can believe me or not but that kind of progress takes a long time. Code needs to be reviewed under open source protocol and then tested under load. It takes many attempts and even non open source like Microsoft and Apple take multiple attempts many times.

Well that's not true, because the last 5 months would recouped, plus you're assuming there was no cost averaging done before the 20k price.

Just a week ago most of us would have been pumped if we knew it was going to go from 7300 to even 8k. Here we are 9k, and still seeing negative posts. It's a strange world.
@_date: 2019-10-24 23:00:52
Lol, integrating and adopting a new disruptive tech that aligns with a new digital world is like winning a sports game with the same rules and odds over 100 years? Naw... I'll go with my own perspective. But please feel free to compare Bitcoin's evolution to carving a pumpkin, washing clothes, or whatever you like!
@_date: 2019-10-16 10:15:53
DCA and you won't give a shit. Just make a regular buy every so often, catching most prices up and down. Just remember there will ALWAYS be people saying what you are saying, just like there was at 1k when they said it would go lower but never, at 3.2k just last year when people said it was going lower but never, etc. So many people with so many guesses, and so many wrong. Just ignore anyone who pretends they know the future, DCA, and chill. It has never failed.

That's never a good idea. Invest what you can afford to lose without too much stress. Imagine if the bear market continues to last for months and you're paying interest on a loan amount for more than your bitcoin is worth. Not to mention buying a large amount in one shot removes your ability to average down in the event that it drops lower before the market turns.
@_date: 2019-06-04 22:14:12
Nothing much to lol at. Either you trade, short or buy the dips and hold as bitcoin slowly integrates with the social collective. Bitcoin is up and down for years, nothing new here.
@_date: 2019-02-04 13:14:27
Their reputation is literally what they thrive on. People trust them with their wealth, and you don't make moves to publicly support something that's a fad or a scam in that position. Besides, if promoting a bitcoin platform gives them free advertising, they must feel there is a lot of interest in bitcoin, so that just reinforces what I'm saying. Of course bitcoin is the future, and it's following the path of almost every technology we've seen over the past century. Bitcoin has already created more jobs than the US government - let's see pokemon cards do that. 
By the way, why in the hell would the NYSE need more advertising or exposure?? You can't really believe that.
@_date: 2019-06-29 03:17:59
Yes they're all sitting in position and secretly conspiring all over the world. Maybe they're on facetime lol. It's called profit taking, sell triggers, chain selling.  There's no big conspiracy man, chill. It's a volatile market, always has been.
@_date: 2019-06-28 11:21:22
Friday typically bodes well for Bitcoin. Looking good so far, but let's see what today brings.
@_date: 2019-06-02 18:15:40
Perhaps you should provide the explanation, you seem to feel you have some authority.
It's irrelevant...if it I walk outside and see that the ground is wet for as far as I can see.... I can safely assume it rained. No explanation of cloud formation, water states, humidity etc. is required. It's common sense that a 1k price move in minutes after days or weeks of low volume and sideways price action CAN NOT be organic collective of small buyers that just by coincidence happened to ALL buy/sell at the same moment in time. You know this.
@_date: 2019-06-29 14:32:09
Agreed. I think of them like penny stocks. They'll always be around as a part of this new market that will continue to mature over time.
@_date: 2019-02-02 20:42:48
True... bitcoin is superior as a value store. And once it matures and the development improves the infrastructure and onramping over the next 20 years, we'll see how many people still think digging rocks out of the ground for a value store holds up in an advanced digital society.
@_date: 2019-06-29 22:15:47
You're very odd. But hey man, whatever makes ya happy right? Preach it.
@_date: 2019-10-11 13:30:50
All interesting thoughts, but honestly, overthinking it never really leads to much. It's been years of people trying to identify a reason for every price move and sometimes there's no reason in particular. This morning, the price almost touched 8800, and it triggered profit taking. There will always be multiple things going on in the economic climate that we can contribute to price fluctuations, but I expect the discovery of bitcoin's price to go on for many years to come. A trader could make a lot of money in this market, as speculation is the prime force driving price, but trading can also stress you out and monopolize your life. As long as the fundamentals stay intact, I say DCA, hold, and wait for the infrastructure to be built. Once it becomes easy for the masses to jump on board without having to mess with exchanges, fear of the unknown, and tax confusion, bitcoin will come into its own. The worse thing we can do is listen to the FUD about how it's been 10 years and more should have been accomplished. That's BS - when it comes to finances, currencies and payment infrastructures, 10 years is a tiny drop in the bucket. Things take time and patience is rewarded.
@_date: 2019-02-14 20:00:47
That's irrelevant. Highly irrelevant. They share nothing in common.

@_date: 2019-06-12 20:51:27
Yes, and the infrastructure with institutional participation is key. Bitcoin has made unprecedented gains on hype and speculation even without the infrastructure currently in the works. One can only imagine the potential moving forward another 10 years, especially when the younger generation get their hands on wealth and enter the game.

A few buddies of mine have been in this space since they mined Bitcoin on their home PCs. They've been wrong about their price prediction over the years more times than I can count. Now, I don't know you but I'm almost 100% certain that they know a hell of a lot more about this space than you do. So when it comes to what the price will be and how it will get there, trust me when I say: You don't know shit.
@_date: 2019-10-04 22:10:05
Everytime the bitcoin community has been this silent in the past has been the best time to buy. I guess we're about to find out over the next month or so if that's the case this time.

Yes, great point. This is another of Bitcoin's many positive attributes for sure.
@_date: 2019-02-06 13:56:00
That's not really disagreeing though :). I feel the same way - any event at any time could impact the public demand for crypto.
@_date: 2019-06-21 17:45:47
Keep on watching the horizon. There's a hoard of new undecided buyers waiting to enter this space. Let's see what they do.
@_date: 2019-02-25 14:58:32
Business as usual. At least the movement over past month is up and selling below mid 3ks seems exhausted.
@_date: 2019-06-15 15:18:53
It always dips a little as it climbs, but the dip you're waiting for this time may only happen when it hits 9k, and only take you back to where we are now anyway. Food for thought :).

Exactly. When it kicks in, it kicks in fast.
@_date: 2019-06-25 11:23:00
Talking about how future tech could penetrate present day security is a moot point. Its like saying that the stealth bombers and other war machines of today could go back to WW1 and end it in minutes. Bitcoin, like all of our technology, will evolve.
@_date: 2019-06-26 14:35:57
Bitcoin is growing. However you rationalize it is laregly based upon information and perspective. The wealthy park their money in real estate, bonds, gold, etc. Bitcoin does not come with the same anchors as these, and can be liquidated fast, 24/7 and cheap. It just took a while for trust in the whole thing to grow, and it will continue to take time, but it's definitely happening. The attraction to buy BTC and make a profit is a big factor but that's always been a factor for investing.
@_date: 2019-06-23 15:03:26
It was, but a clunky read. I don't read as much these days, with work, side projects, etc., so I like a read that flows and has some element of relaxation lol. RP1 has a great plot but it was almost exhausting to read, if that makes any sense. The movie was actually better! Changed a few things from the book here and there, but a great movie. 
The in game currency is totally relatable to crypto.
@_date: 2019-06-27 10:45:47
Just keep DCAing. It works  very well and this is a long game.
@_date: 2019-06-21 16:51:19
I understand but I don't have loads of full bitcoins in the game so 200 bucks per coin owned is not in any way shape or form worth trying to time sells and buys. I know too many guys that get wrecked doing it with really big money. I consider any of us under at least 5 bitcoin in the game small players, so I just ignore $200 drops and lifts lol.
@_date: 2019-02-10 23:59:41
There's the technology and then there's the investment in that technology that many people hope to make gains on. But you've been in this sub a long time so you know that.

Not quite. The last dump was clearly carried out by a single entity. Trying to use ta in this space is like trying to check your blood pressure with a thermometer. 
@_date: 2019-06-26 00:26:38
Of course people are buying it to make gains. But they are doing so with a feeling that there's less risk than before when it appeared that the development and infrastructure would halt. They've seen LN, multiple apps, buy and sell and direct to bank account platforms popping up everywhere. Hell, even Microsoft recently added the BTC symbol to Excel, the spreadsheet used by most financial professionals, as a currency format. So yeah, of course people will see it as a far more legit investment than they did a few years ago. And it is the ultimate value store. Nothing out there comes close with regards to security and hack proof encryption, and the whole damn thing maintains itself. Higher highs and higher lows for years, and it's just getting started. Grester demand for a fixed supply. So if you're still stuck in the whole, bitcoin is just a speculation tool, your refusal to see the big picture may make you may feel left behind sooner than you know.
@_date: 2019-06-05 16:54:16
People getting stressed out over price fluctuations baffles me. This thing jas been going up for years and all facts points towards continuing increases for many years to come. How new would you have to be to sell or panic at this point? It doesn't matter how clear we make it, some people just panic and give their shit away at discounts.
@_date: 2019-08-21 14:51:05
No, not if you want the coffee today and this is the currency we all now use equally across the board. It points back to my initial answer. Regardless of what it will be worth tomorrow, you don't live forever, and you still need the coffee/other things of value to you. What good is any currency, or store of value, if you can't eventually exchange it for something valuable to you?
@_date: 2019-08-06 15:55:42
It went up 3k in 4 days and settled at being up 2400. That's a huge rapid gain, not a crash. Nothing goes straight up man.

Guess you were wrong about that hey? Since it's been resubmitted.
@_date: 2019-06-22 11:52:20
We hit 20k without the advancements in the infrastructure and the spinoff developments we have now. It's far easier to buy and sell bitcoin than it was 2 years ago. I highly doubt 20k will be the top this time.
@_date: 2019-10-13 17:55:27
Yeah I didn't mean you were spreading fud :). I just meant that the topic has been kicked around alot and I think there are people who know very little about it all and may interpret all the headlines as a reason to assume bitcoin will be "broken" by quantum computing. Just another public perception that we will overcome!
@_date: 2019-10-29 22:47:31
So the Bakkt consumer app and the halving are all coming up around same time. So many people are going to be wishing they bought Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-06-01 18:01:34
You need to look past all the bs of the present state, controversy, CW stirring the pot, speculative market, etc. Just focus on what Bitcoin was 6 or 7 years ago to what it is today. Speed and transactions fees will continue to improve with the technology via things like LN, sidechains, code integration and infrastructure. 
Bitcoin transactions are currently slow at times but the foundation that is needed to build on is there: SECURITY. Bitcoin's security comes at the sacrifice of speed and fees today but the future is what you invest in, not the present. Once store of value is mass adopted as we see happening currently, the use for currency transaction for mainstream purchases is the next logical step. History tells us that once something grows in value and is collected on mass level, it can then be used on mass level for currency. By then, the tech will almost certainly have caught up to allow faster and cheaper transactions. Right now we have the fundamental of security, and security trumps speed and fees, because security is the one factor that you can not function and grow without.

This is not 2005 anymore. Self education from resources like youtube have proven far more valuable and versatile than traditional post secondary education.

Scary that people still believe this. Guess what? Fiat has been used for weed, drugs and money laundering for many years and still is in far larger amounts than bitcoin. News articles like to announce whenever bitcoin is involved with criminal activity because it gets them clicks and ad revenue. A person can use a legit company and fiat to stimulate the economy, donate to a worthwhile charity, etc .... or they can use it for criminal activity. You can't blame it on the company or on fiat.
@_date: 2019-06-24 18:28:24
Exactly. It's all part of a crypto ecosystem, and bitcoin is the value store, the bank of the cryptosphere. Not to say bitcoin won't also be used for small transactions one day but it's looking more and more like its destiny is to be the king of value store. I for one am fine with this, because bitcoin has the security, scarcity, energy backing and all the characteristics to be one HELL of store of value.
@_date: 2019-06-29 12:54:48
But you're on here.
@_date: 2019-02-24 17:00:51
It's a game in the sense that all markets are a game. The main difference being that the crypto market is not nearly matured yet so big players have much more impact on the price than they do in traditional markets. For those of us trying to accumulate for the long term every price drop is an entry point.
@_date: 2019-02-05 21:26:09

At 100k per BTC, one satoshi will be 10 cents.  At 1 mil per BTC, one satoshi will be 1 dollar.
There are 100 million satoshi in 1 BTC, so OP was correct.

You need to think harder. You can't possibly compare a centralized database to blockchain. If you do, you're severely misinformed. Perhaps listening to the wrong people or reading the wrong sources. It's not about what you can do with a database, it's about the crypto ecosystem.
@_date: 2019-02-18 18:03:30

You're late to the party. The ship already went down ...for the third time. This is the phase where it starts to slowly resurface again. I respect your perspective, but after a decade of crypto there's one thing that has become undisputable - never compare bitcoin to traditional investing. It is a market yes, but that is where the similarities end.
@_date: 2019-02-12 05:38:29
Not so much with how people have been applying it to pricing simply because no theory has ever been accurate in making sense of bitcoin's price timing outside of understandable hype driven peaks and pull backs. As it applies to the culling of shit coins however, yes I think it's on point.
@_date: 2019-02-14 15:01:31
So all the exchanges, miners, software, OTCs, developers, platforms, etc would just shut down and walk away now after 10 years that the space has come this far why exactly? because the market price of bitcoin is not rebounding fast enough for you? If you really felt that way, why would you wait for another 3k drop to cut your losses? You can just cut them and walk away now.
@_date: 2019-02-03 14:11:48
So after all these years, you honestly don't understand the reason bitcoin is more valuable than just any other non-business type entity? You don't get why a peer to peer currency network that self maintains with perfect accurancy offers value above some common collectable? You sound like you were brainwashed by some old school accountant who shouts at bitcoin the way he shouts at kids to get off his lawn. You and I can talk about this, but our opinions don't change the fact that it's happening. Let's see Fidelity or the owners of the New York Stock Exchange put their reputation on the line for pokemon cards. And for god sakes stop talking about making millionaires. Even with the insane gains from 2017, I still never made millions. This is not about making millionaires it's about building the future.
@_date: 2019-06-11 12:35:57
Sell some stocks and use the money to buy bitcoin? :) 
Seriously though, most stocks that have associated themselves with bitcoin or blockchain are pretty much doing so for the very temporary price lift, and not usually worth the investment. The best way to invest in bitcoin is to buy bitcoin...hands down. No stock can come remotely close to the returns bitcoin has given over the past decade, and this thing has barely even kicked into gear yet.
@_date: 2019-06-13 21:14:25

So I guess you haven't been buying bitcoin for very long? When I bought BTC even as recent as 4 years ago, I had to jump through hoops. Now, I can install an app, fund the account with fiat, buy bitcoin, and cold storage it... all in 5 minutes. 
That's one example. Then there's the actual mining nodes. How secure do you think the bitcoin blockchain infrastructure is today compared to even 5 years ago? Take a wild guess, just based on the increase in algorithm difficulty, and number of miners. What about LN? Sidechains? Explosive growth in exchanges that opened up? Stablecoins? Futures? Fidelity? BAKKT? Oh, what about Blockstream's satellite service?!
These are just off the top of my head. And wait until the kids growing up today with bitcoin in their lives become the business owners, politicians, target market etc. of the world.

@_date: 2019-06-02 14:26:34
Again... when you see the price jump by 1k in less than a half an hour, you think that thousands of people communicated via telepathy and bought or sold all at the same time? Or that a very large player made a huge purchase, be it a whale or a institutions acting on behalf of multiple investors?
@_date: 2019-02-07 11:07:12
No, most people welcome constructive criticism or well thought push back. As far as trolls go, you'll bever beat the 2015 trolls they were brutal, and even then I'm pretty sure that we only reported anyone if they were out of line. 
Nobody cares if you don't think bitcoin is for you, or if you explain where you think it needs improvement, etc. There's just those few that ruin it for the many by posting childish insults and lowering the quality of the thread that should be reported imo.
@_date: 2019-02-02 19:49:46
You compare torrents to bitcoin why? Because of the peer to peer concept? You can send a bitcoin transaction using emojis if you had to. No banks are not going to collapse, and no bitcoin can not be easily shut down either.

95% of traders fail. Fact. Not to mention most people trading in this sub who are trading don't even own a full bitcoin so the whole thing is silly af anyway.

I realize that English may not be your first language, but you need to understand that combing words like dementia, which has nothing to do with anything that's been said here, with the concept of perspective indicates nothing more than a cheap insult. Perspective is based on experience and knowledge, while narrative is based on the context of communication. If you sold your bitcoin at a loss and someone else sold at 20k for a huge gain, then that would create two very different perspectives, just as an example. These things are not personal or any reason to personally attack anyone in this sub. You either support something or you don't. What really matters is that you look at all the information and accept that individuals will have differing perspectives. It's the reason for bear versus bull, religion versus non-religion, one political party versus another, etc. There is not always a defined right or wrong side to every scenario.

Nobody knows. 2019 was considered the year of accumulation. We breached 10k a lot sooner than expected by many.

This is absolutely nothing to worry about. If bitcoin can't be upgraded to be quantum resistant then why would we even be here. All cryptography based security in the world faces this same issue and we'll just move along and evolve we always have over the years. This quantum fud is getting old.

Lol, if course there's a reason. The same reason it's been going up for 10 years - people are increasingly seeing the value of owning and trading bitcoin. People want to invest in an asset that is backed by the resources of computer processing power and energy,  and is self maintained with exceptional security. Unlike stocks which are backed by company financials, AKA corporate politics and bullshit. I'm fortunate to see 10% in my stocks, but bitcoin has dwarfed that with 3x to 10x gains in my investment. Unless something outlandish happens, this increase in participants and business models being built around bitcoin is not going to stop. Remember, until now, the price has only been above 10k for 20 days out of 10 years so this is more of the top price than that 20k blip was in terms of sustainability. So yeah, there's a reason :).

Ha! You seem upset. "Made up"...ha ha, you mean like ALL technology?? Manipulation, you're referring to how price discovery in a very early,  small volume market is easy to impact. Sure! That's inevitable. It doesn't change the fact that bitcoin can make more gains in one day then the stock market can make in an entire year. Or the fact that even with the extreme volatility, bitcoin remains the best return for any investment on the planet....bitch.
@_date: 2019-06-11 12:45:24
Ha ha ha. Sure. I guess bitcoin needs a better browser then LMAO. Bitcoin IS the internet in your analogy. I've learned to love people like you over the years. There are far fewer of you left as any tech evolves, but your complacency and unwillingness to acknowledge reality provides investment opportunity to be drawn out for as long as possible. Remember those people that thought the internet was a huge waste of electricity and would be replaced by something more efficient? That's you. Keep up the good fight sir, your resistance to the natural flow promotes quality assurance :). 
Seriously though, do some research. Due to the nature of bitcoin, and the ten years of proving itself as having the hash power and security worthy of building on top of, it will remain. It will just be improved. It takes alot to establish what bitcoin has established, and there's absolutely no reason to replace it for it to function as needed. There will be other cryptos for niche purposes but not to replace bitcoin.

Also, who ever told you that the first entity is usually overtaken needs to brush up on their knowledge of how technology evolves. Did MS Windows dissapear or did it simply evolve? The dial up modem was slow af, but guess what...they improved it. Shocker! How about the internet itself? Did they give up on the car because it was less efficient than horses at the beginning, or did they continue to improve it? I've worked in IT my whole life, and I can tell you without a shred of doubt...bitcoin will not be replaced. It will be improved.

Of course. Anyone that has been doing this is way up in the green. But the sad reality is that just like it's always been with investing, the majority get emotional, invest too much too soon, and don't think long enough to DCA.

Because it isn't quite user friendly enough yet and the infrastructure for the average retailer is still improving. This is a good thing, because once there are obvious, easy to identify advantages to using bitcoin, the opportunity to buy at these prices will be gone forever.

The only strategy that makes sense is to accumulate in small increments, hopefully catching some or all of the lows.

You couldn't be more wrong...it's as though you're dazed, and maybe confused.
Bitcoin is NOT a product. It's a protocol, and the closest example of bitcoin in recent history would be TCP. At first, tcp was shit...I mean nobody in the industry really thought it would ever scale. Now today, decades later, it runs the entire internet. You are confusing bitcoin for the sceptical crypto market. Bitcoin will be layered upon and scaled for years. Today it is exactly where it should be after only ten years. It takes that long just to gain enough trust to make it worth building on top of.

I don't think many are looking for the one big thing, but there are some people who fall into one extreme, just as you fall into an opposite extreme with your whale theory. Of course there is manipulation in such a young market, but you neglect to acknowledge the driving forces that brought bitcoin from pennies to thousands of dollars in just 10 short years. I'm not claiming that bitcoin is going to be worth a million dollars anytime soon, but it is realistic to recognize that the same forces are still in play, and that crypto is a growing entity globally... not the market price of bitcoin, but the entity itself. It could easily be years before we see another hype pricing phase, but gradual growth relative to development and infrastructure is far more realistic than your whale conspiracy theory.

You think the innovation is going to stop? You think you can judge the future based on the current state of the technology? When in the history of technology has this even ever once been the case? Things can't go from zero to completely advanced without at least a few decades of steps in between.
Bitcoin has the security, which right now comes at the sacrifice of speed and fees. But the security blows the other crytpos out of the water. None of them compare. I couldn't be more confident that bitcoin tech will be built on top of this security for years to come.

The buying FOMO was enormous on Wednesday. I assure you, there was more than one player involved in that drop. I'm not sure what you don't understand about that.

But that would mean they took one lump sum and dropped it all at once during the highest price in 10 years (which lasted just a few days out of 10 years) and never bought any since to average in. That's a horrible example!! Most investing is done a little at a time, so much per week, month, whatever, so you are buying at all prices and not just one. People who save money do it a little at a time.

Hey man, I doubt it will happen anytime soon as well, but I'm just saying any one catalyst can send the price up very fast when it comes to bitcoin. Personally I'd prefer to see slow steady growth based on adoption and fundamentals, but we're talking about what 'can' happen.

The fact that you have to divide anything in to smaller units due to a limited supply of the whole unit, makes the whole unit along with its broken down portions higher in value the more you divide. And that's the point.
The fact that we "can" divide bitcoin into smaller units, is why the system can work very well into the foreseeable future.

It's not about needing an ETF. It's about the public sentiment. If you want to keep Bitcoin use confined within a tiny nich of users, fine. I see the goal of global adoption as the end game here. That does not include exceptions to ETFs or anything we're afraid of because of some theory you read online. It should include everything. 
@_date: 2019-06-03 04:07:48
You are gone way off course. When I bought my first bitcoin many years ago, there were large players in the space and this is more true today than ever. I don't participate with a million dollars so I don't know how I'd go about executing a buy of that size, nor do I waste time planning the hypothetical. Look, the 1k jumps that happen in minutes are absolutely the deep pocket buyers, it's all on the blockchain to see. Are you that new to this space that you don't understand this? 
I don't buy the manipulation theory nearly as much as many others in the space, but I'm simply telling you that a small few are moving the price and it's been that way for a long time. Personally I don't care. I've watched this thing grow and see it integrating with society. The end result remains the same regardless of large buyers impacting price. I initially commented on your post because you seemed quite confused on your understanding of equality on both sides of a trade. This conversation has become completely pointless. I do however wish you all the luck with your investing in this market! Cheers.

No, that is incorrect. How on earth do you propose the powers that be would successfully kill bitcoin? Not to mention these powers you refer to would have to come together and agree on a global level to push such an outrageous initiative. If anything, the powers that be will find a way to profit from bitcoin. There's no stopping bitcoin and crypto now, the integration with society has already begun. Perhaps 5 or 6 years ago they may have had a chance, but now there's no stopping this thing.

If you change the base unit then you could say that about ANYTHING you divide. Not to mention you can't change the base unit of BTC, it would destroy the entire concept and will never happen. Ever. 1 Bitcoin = 100 million Sats. That's not going to change. 1 Sat is 0.00000001 BTC for always. If they one day have to divide a satoshi then the value of 1 BTC would have had to increase astronomically. This debate has been had years ago, I've had this discussion with redditors a long time ago. Nothing new to determine.

Volatility is a result of it being both new and having a relatively small number of market participants. The more people that buy bitcoin, the more difficult it will be to move the price as large players hold a smaller percentage of the whole. The crypto market is still in its infancy.
@_date: 2019-06-25 11:27:45
There is a very good chance but this is bitcoin. Nothing should be ruled out completely. A lot of people were waiting for that 10k confirmation to jump in on this though.

Im referring to platforms to build upon like Ether and Neo, and inventory solutions like Vechain etc. I agree they are very few compared to what's out there, but there are a few projects that have great potential and strong partnerships with legit companies. Volatile price is just a result of early stage development, I wouldn't be too concerned there. They're only a few years old.
In any case I'm 90% more into bitcoin and I've never been more confident in its future positioning as a value store and eventual currency use than I am these days.

@_date: 2019-06-26 14:41:39
Bitcoin can potentially continue to increase in price until everyone on the planet who invests in anything, invests in some bitcoin. Yet the fixed amount will never increase. Rapidly growing demands for a fixed supply. You do the math. 20k? That's a joke compared to how high this can go.... before and after the halving.
@_date: 2019-02-01 00:48:20
Most people DCA with small amounts. 100 bucks here and there. If you have the discipline to still put that money away and hold on to it for the day that you 'think' it's going to rise rapidly, then sure that may work out. But in my experience, it's fairly difficult to catch and hard to know when a spike will continue to a bigger spike and eventually a bull market or bull run. Popping in a little money here and there is easier to manage.

Yeah for sure. I just buy small amounts here and there when it looks like a good buy. I don't see this as the moon ride though by any means.

@_date: 2019-02-07 17:25:22
I wish I knew, but hype and FOMO can be driven by so many unpredictable scenarios it's impossible to predict. I'd guess that there will be many other driving scenarios such as institutional investment via Fidelity/bakkt, security tokens, new developments in the tech, etc. 
A prolonged bear market certainly allows time for old wounds to heal, but the retail investment losses make up only a tiny fraction of potential investors. As on ramps to the crypto space become more user friendly and secure, the space may open up to a whole new group of investors. There's also the fact that while much focus has been on the losses, there were also a lot of gains. The drop from 20k to 3k means a lot of folks sold, so not everyone had a bad experience. The bad experiences just  get the loudest voice.
@_date: 2019-10-30 02:39:26

It's no reflection of interest dropping.
@_date: 2019-06-20 13:35:00
Most people in this space don't think that can happen in a year. But considering how it's gone from pennies to 9k in such a short time on low saturation, it would be rational to expect that the expanding infrastructure of advancing tech and increasing acceptance of Bitcoin's value will lead to a million dollar BTC in time.
@_date: 2019-10-24 13:37:03
If you make a big purchase sure. I just DCA and every price in these early years is a good day imo. But yeah....big drops like that always gets me buying lol.
@_date: 2019-06-27 18:12:01
Also, it isn't just whales. It's the follow the leader mentality and FOMO works both up and down in price. Plus it's difficult for people who have been buying since the 3000 range to not take profits.
@_date: 2019-06-13 21:21:31
But they pale in comparison with regards to security. Significantly less secure. And security is why bitcoin is king, and why it will be developed and improved for years to come. If you have security, you can always improve speed. The opposite is not the case.

Hmm, I don't recall saying exactly that, and I'd have no more way of knowing that than you would of knowing any differently. However, it seems to have sparked some emotion in you, so sure. Let's pretend that's what I said :).
Look, I added some valid points to my statement, as I usually try to do. But my initial statement was "people are increasingly seeing the value of owning and trading bitcoin". Bitcoin has graduated from the fad stage, and more people are accepting it as a legit investment. Considering the returns it's brought us, and the considering the definition of investment, I'd say it's alarming that people have been as slow as they have catching on.
@_date: 2019-06-12 15:34:21
I was about to comment on how incredibly unlikely it would be for history to be unwritten, progress to be undone and bitcoin to ever drop back to 1k. But then I checked your post history and realized you either know nothing about bitcoin or are bored af and have just been pretending to be brain dead to get a rise out of people on here because you have nothing more interesting to do. Either way.... a zombie apocalypse is more likely than a 1k bitcoin ...though many of us would probably love to have another chance to buy at 1k!!
@_date: 2019-06-03 14:13:18
You do. Otherwise you could never possibly need me to show you how to go to blockchain.com and view a transaction. The link for the transaction that caused the 9k spike was all over the net last week. Please at least look!

The reason Fidelity, bakkt and proposed ETF's are a thing is that they see a huge opportunity where most people are not comfortable with being solely responsible for their wealth. People like the concept of bitcoin, and it's clear after this past decade that a growing number of people want to own some bitcoin. But ... most people are fine with paying for the services that banks provide. They like that assurance that if something happens to their money, the banks have their back. So while many of us here in these forums like the idea of controlling our money and being responsible for our keys, the reality is that most people are not comfortable with this. That is why bakkt, Fidelity and many more businesses will make a killing over the years to come. That is also why banks will most likely not be made irrelevant. How would a bitcoin bank work? They will provide hassle free cold storage with insurance that your wealth in bitcoin will be covered in the event of a loss, theft, hack etc.... for a fee.
@_date: 2019-02-01 04:15:07

That's a long ways away. Most people don't even own any bitcoin yet. As more and more people start to buy, the price will likely continue upwards for years.

It will happen. Coders didn't build tcp and internet protocols because they wanted to use cloud storage, facetime or download porn. They code because that's what coders do. Bitcoin will continue to grow and evolve and integrate with society because the coders don't give a shit about its market price. But sure as the sun rises, the price will rise with the growth.
@_date: 2019-02-01 15:34:41
I just read this in an article on bitcoin's comparison to gold. This is so well stated:
"*The reality is that gold has thousands of years up on Bitcoin, which has only been around since 2009, and represents an entire paradigm shift in how we think of banking and money, one that will not be overcome without difficulty.*
*Although it has already held the distinction of best investment in the history of the world at the tender age of eight, Bitcoin is still not a mature currency, and its advocates are not under any illusions that it is, although it would appear that its critics are*."

I don't think he understands the concept of blocking torrents, or of bitcoin and bitcoin mining distribution, etc. He may be referring to his workplace blocking torrent traffic, if it were achieved through deep packet inspection of the actual protocol, but even then this is not likely in today's world. Torrents are used for too many software updates and are no longer throttled by ISPs or partially blocked by firewalls like they were 10 years ago. It was never really fully successful anyway. 
@_date: 2019-02-01 18:05:46
Crypto will co-exist with fiat for at least the remainder of our lifetimes anyway, so the whole thing is moot. Regardless of banks providing storage options or not, it would be up to an individual whether or not they use it and bitcoin is still decentralized and not tied to any one country or region.
@_date: 2019-02-01 04:36:29
Currently, very few I'd imagine. But it's the onramp into the crypto ecosystem that will involve the fiat/bitcoin conversion. Companies won't be dealing with bitcoin, nor will the owners of all the other assets that will be tokenized (real estate, art, etc.).

@_date: 2019-02-19 17:52:05
Irrelevant. If you can't eventually have the same options to use bitcoin as you use fiat, how do you expect to have complete adoption? Gold is different as it shares only the store of value component of use with Bitcoin but not the limited supply. You're missing the much MUCH bigger picture here. Once an ETF is approved, it would set in motion a public perspective of legitimacy, and the spin off effect and additional adoption that would result would dwarf the smaller issue of any manipulation enabled by the first approved ETF. Math dictates that manipulation becomes less and less possible when the amount used to action such manipulation becomes an increasingly smaller percentage of the whole.

Everytime you start hearing there's a drop coming, it almost always turns out to be wrong and sometimes even the opposite.

There are still people afraid to use banking apps. You can't change old school thinking and you can't make people embrace new technology that doesn't align with their fixed understanding of traditional investing. Some people feel an asset has to be backed by a company's financials to have value because that's all they know.
Give it a shot. Try and explain the incredible security of holding wealth in  bitcoin, the trustless exchange, the savings of eliminating the middleman &amp; freedom of exchange, money as streaming content, the massive growth over just 10 years, etc. If they can't get it, don't blame them or assume they're stupid.

When was it ever used on any magnitude as a currency? Its use as a decentralized value store with 24/7 liquidation options and higher security than any other digital asset on the planet is more than enough to see bitcoin succeed. Your nit carrying around gold bars, or turning real estate back into cash whenever you need with a few clicks. I also think currency use is still on the table but we need to be realistic - you don't change currency in 10 years lol. That takes generations.
@_date: 2019-02-13 14:43:45

It's already started. I don't have any crazy amount of investment in bitcoin, just include it with my other investments. But I did well with it since I bought it for quite a while. Certainly far from late to the party. Besdies, the party is barely started. You would think that considering we are here, having his discussion 10 years after bitcoin was created, you would be aware that this is happening. But you and I will be old before bitcoin really comes into fruition. Things don't just stop evolving. You honestly thought that after everything in this world that has converted to digital, store of value would not follow suit? How does one get so complacent?
@_date: 2019-02-05 23:43:38
In my opinion the time frames are what leads people like yourself to think it's nonsense. I'd like to think there's far more of us who are realistic in the whole mass adoption time. That's not happening overnight. I see no reason why there wouldn't be an ETF within the next few years though. I mean bakkt and Fidelity are fairly certain to happen, so an ETF doesn't seem all that much of a stretch from those platforms.

No, it's a a statistical fact that 5% of of traders are successful. In the crypto space it's hard af because multiple small traders are playing a game where a handful of whales are moving the lions share via multiple wallets. Also, it's about timing, not the number of sells and buys. You can sell at a profit and if you stop there then you win. But traders want to sell and buy again lower,  but a if a whale drives the price up higher as we've been seeing now for months, you better have some ninja timing skills to buy back before the next lift.

I'm not on board with that strategy. I prefer to spread it all around a little, and bitcoin definitely falls within my high risk potion of investments. It continues to grow, and as far as tokens are concerned, tokenization of assets is almost inevitable at this point. Guess what will be used to purchase tokens in a crypto ecosystem? Bitcoin, that's right. 
@_date: 2019-02-12 05:18:45
Give up what? It's  not a crossword puzzle and it's not like the posters in here are contributing code and working with the dev team. And if you're talking about investing in bitcoin, damn man... I've held investments for years before they paid off, and bitcoin has been way better  than most of them. I don't know what the hell anyone expects. It's up 300% since just 2 years ago and  only came into inception 10 years ago. How much faster can anyone expect this to grow? Another few years and we're probably even going to see a phase where it starts providing easy to use advantages to the mainstream public and then it's going to move even faster. This is not a logical time to talk about giving up. This shit is just getting started.

Anyone looking to get rich has likely moved on by now. But for making some gains on your money, including bitcoin in the high risk portion of your investments in the case that this thing continues to grow as it has been for a decade is not a bad move by any means. No, I don't agree with looking at only the first 9 years. To make an assessment using data, ALL the data must be used. Price will be up and down for a long time, but the building of a crypto ecosystem with bitcoin as the crown jewel has been VERY consistent and increasing over time. Anyone that thinks this is all going to stop being built at this point is most certainly not looking at all the data.

If it were going to affect the market it already would have. That being said, the whole thing seems very odd. A large exchange losing its access to cold storage like that is poor organization and protocol on the company's part for sure, but it also stresses the importance of not leaving your bitcoin on an exchange unless the exchange offers a guarantee to cover your losses.

Obviously if they are adults, then more people will have heard of ETF than bitcoin, but this is still early days. After years in this space, I've had my head in many things. An ETF is but one more brick in the wall. I occasionally run into people who have their mind made up already on particular stances, and you fall into that category. I am simply saying that you can not support total adoption and then make exceptions. ETFs are a growing investment vehicle  choice in today's world. If you truly believe that Bitcoin will succeed then forget about the potential manipulation of an ETF. The market will mature and besides, every ETF provides varying options and mechanics. You can't possible roll them all into one description.
@_date: 2019-02-19 17:03:52
People need to stop saying we don't want an ETF because we don't need it, and that it will just lead to more manipulation and all that BS. What anyone who supports bitcoin should want is additional adoption - period. That means that eventually anything and everything that people do with fiat they can do with bitcoin. That includes buying a pizza, ordering something online, investing, etc... and yes that includes an ETF along with multiple other investment options. People around the globe associate an ETF with legitimacy and that's a win for bitcoin once we get one. It would lead to a multitude of other developments. It's not about wanting banks to 'save' anyone, it's about ADOPTION.

Yes you are correct. However, NOT the exchange model of the future.  Anyone with even a small amount of brain activity understands that bitcoin is not to blame for the QuadrigaCX  blunder and mismanagement. If your family lost all its gold because you had it hidden, and then died without telling anyone else where it was, do you think people should blame the gold?
Oh but make no mistake, the media will try to spin this story to profit from the ignorant who believe bitcoin is the problem, when the reality is the problem here is lack of  due diligence on behalf of the company.
@_date: 2019-06-16 00:34:33
Well, to your point, I can certainly see a day when it won't be relevant what bitcoin is worth in USD,  because bitcoin will be the medium of exchange for pretty much anything you could ever need.
@_date: 2019-12-06 17:38:16
EDIT: Now Answering 1 &amp; 2 separately.


The value of Bitcoin is based on its use, security and efficiency of its network creating a "network effect". A successful currency must have scarcity, divisibility, utility and transferability. Bitcoin EXCELS in all these areas. What gives fiat value? Fiat currency is issued by a government, not backed by anything other than the faith that other parties will accept that currency.
Bitcoin is backed in a sense, by the mining technology, processing power, electricity and incredible security of its network. If anything, Bitcoin meets the definition of a currency better than any other currency in history - we just to let time do its job until more people become aware of this. It's already happening.


Supply and Demand. This is why halving the reward to miners every 4 years tends to increase the price over time after halving - the supply is capped, and the roll out of the supply is controlled by math. One could argue that Bitcoin is the most accurately valued asset/currency in history.


I have never ran a country (no surprise there lol), but I assume that if the government supported a replacement of their currency with a digital cryptocurrency equivalent, then they can. It's already happening in countries now. This is NOTHING like Bitcoin because it would be centralized and certainly no threat to Bitcoin, which is global, peer to peer, open source and decentralized.






I'll let someone else answer this. I have never thought about establishing a new country, and I never will :)
@_date: 2019-06-12 15:52:11
It'll be interesting to see how many people actually hold all the way to mass adoption. I know many say they won't sell until at least 100k, but people said similar about Amazon, Apple, Salesforce, etc but sold way before the top. Once you double, triple or quadruple your initial investment, it's hard for many to resist selling long before a price reaches its potential.
@_date: 2019-10-18 11:13:37
Ha ha ha. Yeah wait for 3100 man, you do that. Think I'll pass.
@_date: 2019-12-02 16:07:19
The bigger the battering the better the buy. In less you'd prefer to pay double or triple for it. It's only been 10 years but if one thing is abundantly clear, it's that Bitcoin is here to stay. So if you're going to buy it, then it's a no-brainer to get in for as low as possible and watch the show over the next few years. It's going to be a good show :).
@_date: 2019-12-08 17:12:18
Why would anyone think the price will pop on the very day of a halving? It never has before. The impact of a lower flow of supply needs time to be felt. Through the year that follows is when the price will start ramping up, assuming all things continue on track to progress as they have been.
@_date: 2019-02-21 23:13:05

Until it doesn't. Which will happen, unless "this time is different", which is unlikely since bitcoin reversed direction every other time in its history of downward movement.

@_date: 2019-12-02 17:36:16
This is how things evolve. It's difficult to get people to take a risk and buy Bitcoin at 7k. But if Bitcoin were mass accepted and trusted, people would buy at 50k (not always an entire coin of course) and not bat an eye.
The thing is, it's always those willing to take the risk and have patience that are rewarded in the end if the risk pays off.
@_date: 2019-06-12 13:32:14
It doesn't work that way, they'd have to at least borrow on the said amount. Even if this was possible it wouldn't destroy bitcoin.There are currently 17,739,812.5 bitcoins in circulation. 100,000 would be a minor setback at best. After all that bitcoin has endured this past 10 years and somehow managed to now thrive more than ever, it would take a hell of a lot more than this extremely hypothetical scenario to "destroy" bitcoin. Perhaps the complete destruction of the internet may destroy bitcoin, in which case we'd have more to worry about... and even that may not completely destroy it since there are multiple other ways to communicate a wallet address.

Regret it how? I've worked in tech for over 20 years, and I have multiple investments. I've studied how tech evolves, and I understand why Bitcoin's protocol has come so far in such a short time. The building on top of this protocol has only just now begun after it's had a decade to prove it's solid and stable. I love this shit, and I invest in multiple verticals. Why would I regret being into the one technology that I am most confident will succeed on a massive global level? Please enlighten me. What part of Bitcoin's massive network effect do you feel will fail and why?
@_date: 2019-02-07 16:05:15
You're welcome! It's worth mentioning that there was no way to see that 20k spike coming. It literally felt like the top all the way up. If I could go back in time would I have bought more before Dec 2017? Yes. Would I have sold more at 20k? yes - and reinvested it through averaging down to this point. Bottom line, when we hit 2 and 3k k again in 2017, that was already massive success. That 20k spike was an anomaly build from hype and ICOs, but now we're back on track and I'd be shocked if this thing doesn't continue to build momentum just as it has been for a decade.

There's going to be a lot of buying from this point onward for quite a while. People are catching on that bitcoin can no longer be ignored as a part of their investment strategy. It can no longer be called a fad by the ignorant. It's consistently provided returns that make the stock market pale in comparison. Every day bitcoin becomes less likely to ever go away. It's backed by the resources of computer processing power and energy, it's self-maintained, and its security is off the charts. Who the Fu with even a grain of sense wouldn't want to invest in that?
EDIT: Add to the above a growing demand for a limited supply, and it's not difficult to envision where this is headed.
@_date: 2019-06-24 00:52:12
Nobody knows for sure. I hope I'm wrong, because I'd actually prefer to have the remainder of the year to accumulate. But seeing so many more people looking at every small price dip as an opportunity, I honestly don't believe the price will be below 11k for long.

Nobody can possibly have those answers. The price doesn't follow an exact pattern. It reflects the public demand. Any development could occur at any time that changes things. All we know is that bitcoin has been growing steadily for a decade in terms of the technology and how it is being implemented via improvements, exchanges, apps, platforms, regulations, etc.
Just remember, there was a time when skeptics laughed and mocked the possibility of a $100 bitcoin. Since its inception it has been overcoming all odds.

Holding works best if you cost average. Even in the wackiest year of 2017, if you cost averaged, most of your buys would have been when Bitcoin was lower than 5k. If you cost averaged the same purchase amount you'd have also bought plenty between 3200 and 4k this year as well.
Anyone that says holding doesn't work are dense, and not considering that holders have been making regular buys and have been catching all prices. If you do this, you will almost certainly be in the green and can sell for a profit anytime you want or continue accumulating. People overcomplicate things, in a lot of cases because they want to appear smart. The stress of trying to time this market, in my opinion, makes trading completely not worth it. You'll most likely lose more than you gain.
@_date: 2019-06-23 21:39:18
Alot of people were waiting for this price range to feel confident that bitcoin has recovered. There's been a mental barrier for a lot of people who needed to see the price rise to over 10k and stay there to feel there is less risk in a bitcoin investment.

Lol sure. Listen I'm in this long term, so I'm all for getting an extra few bitcoin at 2k a pop. But logically there's no reason for that to happen. Any opportunity to sell has been had multiple times over. All we're seeing now is mini sells off the pumps that create new profits.

Coinbase is probably the last exchange I'd worry about...BUT I'd still suggest you store any BTC you plan to hold on to for long term on a cold wallet. Nano and Trezor are both very user friendly, easy to purchase, and provide the best peace of mind. Just be sure to store the seed words safely away and you can always restore your wallet even if you lose the Ledger Nano or Trezor device. If you can learn to use email, the features on smart phones, a spreadsheet and other business docs/apps, etc, or even just coming on here to post in a Reddit sub, you can use a cold wallet. Just REMEMBER your password for the device and store seed words in a SAFE place.
First time will be a small learning curve like anything because it's new, but you'll figure it out. Take your time and follow the steps provided. Ledger's website for example, lays it all out in easy to follow steps. Also, I'd suggest buying the Nano from the company website and not some third party seller. Another great benefit of all this is that you'll get comfortable with sending and receiving, using wallet addresses, etc. Good luck!

@_date: 2019-12-12 20:49:27
You can't price in a lack of supply that slowly builds demand pressure over time. That kind of thinking comes from ignorance of Bitcoin in the sense that many people only have an understanding of traditional stocks, based on a single company's performance, news, earnings reports, etc.
@_date: 2019-12-21 00:46:19
But my initial point is that many come to this sub to get answers to questions that have nothing to do with price. Not to mention, I'd hardly call speculation of price related in any way to news media. 
Many people, myself included, simply advise newcomers to invest only what they are comfortable with, warn them of the volatlity, and pass on the consistent success we've experienced thus far using a simple DCA strategy over at least 3 years or more. The price is all over the place but there is no debating that ever 3 or 4 years it does climb significantly. Now if trying to time buying and selling, trading, shorting, etc., there is a bitcoinmarkets sub for all that.
There's no need to cherry pick comments at all. There are some that focus on price sure, but there are also some that focus on the tech. If most people upvote positive price outlooks it's probably because most people in the sub feel the price has a positive outlook.
I couldn't care less about short term predictions. They're just noise, as I have been saying for years that I expect real development of the protocol within the next decade and the price should logically advance relatively as more and more people add Bitcoin to their investment portfolio, even if in small amounts. I'd say 10 years of running solid should start to instill confidence going forward but let's wait and see what happens. It's an interesting space for sure.
@_date: 2019-12-05 19:53:56
Well, sort of. I mean the independence of having complete control, almost like having your own bank, is one of the most attractive features of Bitcoin.  But as you said, this is not for everyone and we are so vastly early in the timeline, it is pretty much to be expected that it will be the younger generation who love having that control over their wealth and grew up using virtual currency online, even as basic as video game currencies and tokens for online interactions, that will drive adoption as they become the mass population of tomorrow.
Until then, Bitcoin is still one hell of an asset to dip into for a risk portion of a portfolio, even if a very small portion. Every 3 or 4 years the thing just doubles and triples in value as more and more people begin to explore moving into the ecosystem. The only thing Bitcoin needs is time. At least now, it has 10 years of data to evaluate its security and reliability as a network, and the findings are exceptionally impressive.

Yes there are a lot of factors to consider. But in my opinion, if Bitcoin managed to thrive through the oast decade, there's really nothing that can be worse that what's already been thrown at it. Quantum computing is a non issue, mostly just a fun way for media articles to get ckicks by posting future tech against present but on reality, things evolve relatively. Governments are highly unlikely to unite globally and ban Bitcoin, there are more thrid party industry and infrastructure than ever before, we are seeing the beginning of layers being developed on top of the Bitcoin protocol, similar to how TCP evolved, there are new investment olatforms and offerings popping up all the time, new mining operations, bitcoin mining hashrate is very high, bitcoin dominance is at an ath, and storage companies and custody solutions are coming out of the woodwork. If there was ever a time to bullish on Bitcoin price, it's over the next decade. Not a get rich quick method, but anyone with patience should do well if they xan stomach the volatility along the way.
@_date: 2019-02-06 13:16:51
There's no reason why Bitcoin's price should or should not do anything. It may be down a lot from the top price in Dec 2017, but it's up over 300% in the past 2 years. We all need to keep this in perspective. Understand that this whole thing has been reining back to a reasonable point where it could then easily continue on its climb. If you're averaging in to accumulate and you're not in a rush or delusional in some hope to become a millionaire overnight, then this is actually a positive thing. Because if you recall, there was very little time to grab bitcoin when the price was skyrocketing so fast in Dec 2017. Slow and steady always wins.

The waiting is the hardest part. It takes patience to let things develop over time naturally, and most people form opinions on the potential of things like Bitcoin after taking only between 5 minutes and an hour to learn about them.
Then there are the rest of us - those with patience, and a solid understand that the future potential of Bitcoin goes against everything we have come to understand about the world's financial system and investing as it has existed for most of our lives. Because it's about to change.

Transaction fees have leveled off in a very affordable range. These days, the total fees paid to miners is approximately $76,000 per day for about 300,000 different transactions. That makes the average fee is only 25 cents per transaction. 
There's also the overhead for much further improvement on top of this again. Honestly, I'd say this will continue to improve along with all the other bitcoin developments for years to come. Remember we are in extremely early days. The lightning network is a second layer over the bitcoin network, and lets people transfer Bitcoin instantly and without any fees. It creates payment channels between the users.  Imagine the endless possibilities of a payment system that can reach anyone instantly with no overhead. What has happened over recent years with audio and video streaming will likely happen to money. Streaming money! 
Remember, one of the main advantages that bitcoin brings us is to use money as routable digital content. The future of money is being built, and one only needs to look around at the past and the present to realistically envision the future of bitcoin.

I'm not propagating anything. You're the only person I've ever felt the need to mention it to :). I want this market to mature as much as anyone! I just realize it will take time. Pretty much everyone else involved in crypto is well aware that all of our little trades combined are like a pebble on a beach when the wallets with thousands of BTC make a move. This is not nonsense, it just is what it is. 
Here’s an example from 2013, where a single entity was largely responsible for pushing the price of Bitcoin from $150 to $1,000 in two months. 
Another paper that came out last summer shows how large amounts of USDT was used to manipulate Bitcoin prices: 
Again I see no reason to worry - new market. Until it matures there will be stop loss hunting, short and long hunting, spoofing and wash trading. This will get harder as more participants enter the space. 
I've worked in the tech industry for years, and the future looks incredible for bitcoin in my humble opinion. The security bitcoin offers with its decentralized and self maintained ledger has immense potential. Once this thing kicks in the sky is the limit. Forget the speculative market crap and the Craig Wright drama. When Microsoft added the bitcoin symbol to the excel spreadsheet as a currency format option last week? THAT'S an example of the small steps that build mass use. That's what I see as progress and what I choose to focus on.

True, there has been a lot of hype about the halving for sure. Many believe that 2020 is going to be a bullish year, but it's typical for the year after a halving to be bullish. And you can't really price in supply and demand before the fact. 
A big difference in now and 2017 is that there are more ways to buy, the purchase process itself has become much more user friendly, and exchanges have improved their infrastructure to handle more users. A lot of very smart people have pointed out that if the exchanges didn't get bottlenecked in 2017 and didn't have to start turning new users away to long wait lists, the price may very well have made it up to 30k or higher. That makes a lot of sense too, because once exchanges couldn't handle any more users the price climb stopped and everyone saw that as a signal to get out before it started falling. They'd have still sold, but it may have gotten much higher before the bubbble popped.
Guess we'll see what 2020 holds in store soon enough!

Because an investment in Bitcoin is a bet that it will be a more widely accepted value store and/or currency in the future. That's kind of the whole point of investing in it. The fact that many people still feel as you do is what creates the opportunity. If it were already a mass adopted success where would the opportunity be??
When Amazon was flopping back and forth and many believed the company was not going to thrive, that was the time to buy it, not 20 years later, now that it's a massive success. Bitcoin is not a new smart phone it's an entirely new concept for wealth storage and transaction. Ten years is not long enough to see it fully evolved, but long enough to see that it has established a solid and secure base protocol  for massive future success.
No opportunity exists without risk, otherwise we'd all be rich. I see the developments and innovation in the works right now that can build on top of, and take Bitcoin's protocol to a whole new level of global adoption and it's "because" there are many who raise the same concerns as you that I believe Bitcoin is a great investment opportunity. You don't buy it once it has achieved that level, you buy it now!

It doesn't matter if 99% of the demand is for BTC though does it. A fork is simply a copy of the software. There are plenty of open source software examples and you can freely copy all you like. But you won't have the developer support or network effect which is where the trust you referenced  comes from. They can fork all they want at this point, because Bitcoin has secured the network effect.

People think Bitcoin is a scam because it's a completely different way to transact wealth. People are often very skeptical of change,  which is why it often takes entire generations to see mass adoption in many areas. 
Also, there's been so many stories of hacked exchanges, lost keys, Bitcoin being used for criminal activity, dark web, get rich quick scams, etc., that anyone who doesn't understand what Bitcoin even is, fails to differentiate between shady activity involving Bitcoin, and actual Bitcoin itself. Truth is, fiat has been and still is used way more than Bitcoin for criminal activity but people are already familiar with fiat so they don't associate it with criminal use.
Then there's simply the pessimists who refuse to stop calling Bitcoin a fad, even after a decade. I was recently chatting with a person on Reddit who believes that the fact that most Bitcoin are already mined means that Bitcoin will be finished soon. And this seemed like a fairly intelligent person. That's what we're dealing with, so time is the only thing that will correct this. Bitcoin is not going away,  it just needs time.

I've been investing for 20 years or so, I'm fine ha ha. I was just trying to help you understand that Bitcoin blows your little Vanguard out of the water. How you don't see that sounds like you only bought it one time....at it's fucking high!!!!!! Why in the name of God would you buy it at 20k and not at 3200 just less than a year ago. If you can't look at at least a 3-4 year window, you're not investing, you're trading and gambling. I thought I'd try to pass on a little knowledge to you but if you believe Vanguard is a better investment than Bitcoin than you're a totally lost cause.
What on earth do you mean assuming you have money every week????!!! How the hell can you invest if you don't have money every week? You can't just buy something once if you're investing, you have to buy in increments to catch all price points, both high AND low. This applies to your Vanguard shares, etc., hell even a property mortgage requires regulat payments. If you buy Bitcoin only once OF COURSE you're not gonna make money!

It would increase the number of calculations that can be made in any given amount of time by an enormous amount. If and when a general use quantum computer becomes a reality then that processing technology will also be used across all computing. In the case of Bitcoin, the mining algorithm would have to evolve to a quantum resistant state and the mining rigs will also use quantum processors to solve and mine. Remember, there's a Bitcoin core update released every 6 months and all updates included are approved through a rigorous approval process within the opensource bitcoin dev community. Quantum computing is among the last things that pose a threat to Bitcoin.

It's difficult to define normal. I mean 2014 and 2015 were still the very worst years imo, so in terms of "this happens a lot", yes this is normal. But nobody ever likes it, the trolls WILL be out in full force, and weak hands will exit. But that's all necessary before a reversal so certainly nothing to be alarmed about, that's for sure. 
You need to remember, Bitcoin is not the crypto market, and Bitcoin is still being developed, still highly secure, and still has the exact same potential as it did just 5 months ago when it was much higher in price. The market price is based on speculation like precious metals. So as far as the market price goes, yes this is normal. Welcome to the most volatile investment you'll ever own, yet still the best investment of that past decade :).

@_date: 2019-12-18 15:31:52
Ha, well that's a bit extreme! I mean not as much chance as a single company's stock going to 0, but hey anything is possible right? If Bitcoin was going to zero, it would have happened in the past decade already, particularly after the whole Mt Gox mess. There's too much development, and money pumped into the surrounding industry around Bitcoin now days to see it go to zero, with all the programmers, exchanges, apps, proposed investment funds, futures markets, storage companies, new mining operations, etc., to see this go away now. 
I simply mean it's a risk because anything can happen, sure, and because it can go lower than your invested worth at any time, and you could be waiting a long time to see it rise again. But there's now an entire new market created around Bitcoin, with endless useless alt coins, almost mimicking the penny stocks of the traditional markets, etc. It's here to stay almost for certain. But there's a long road ahead, so we'll see where it takes us.

Lame is also generalization and stereotyping a group of people with little to no knowledge of the subject matter. If Bitcoin failed, I'd be dissapointed, but not so much about the money. 
What is it about some people that thier minds cannot grasp the timeline of all this stuff. I have been following this space for years and the concept of Bitcoin being 7k right now after just a few hundred dollars 4 years ago was every bit as much as crazy of a fantasy as saying now that it may reach 100k. Before that it was crazy to think it would have ever reached 100 dollars too, yet there have always been people like yourself making generalizations.
You call other people sheep, which is hilarious. You're the one following a negative perspective without a shred of reasoning. How many books did you read? Podcasts? Interviews with developers? What is your knowledge of the new developments currently being worked on to implement into future core updates? What exactly is it that you believe people are following blindly? Or have you wrapped us all up in the same ball of wax as the retail investors who FOMO'd in during late 2017?
Easy money? Lol, sure I suppose if you count the people who bought and held through the thick and thin. Many of us got in early, but sold after Bitcoin went many times its price, thinking it can't keep going up and up, yet it still is. Bitcoin is an investment that requires vision and an understanding of how long this takes. Also, it's gold that Bitcoin will displace, long before fiat. Get that straight or at least look around and be aware before you post ignorance.

It's not just another currency. It's an entirely new concept of money and asset class that requires a new way of looking at how wealth is transacted and stored. That takes generations to shift. It also requires infrastructure. 
Then there's the fact that asking an average person who knows little to nothing about what Bitcoin even is to trust putting their hard earned money into a new type of system that is foreign to their understanding and view of how they've always done things is a big deal. To think it was only a few hundred dollars 5 years ago and now it's 7k is already impressive for a new concept that has no company marketing team, promotion budget or government backing.
Now that Bitcoin has 10 years of running secure and stable more people will likely trust it with their wealth and more development can now be built on top of this proven solid base protocol. 
Add to all that the fact that the younger generation will be far more familiar with the digital gold and transaction concept, and I think the next decade is where we will see the real growth in Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-12-09 21:14:39
Well it's been challenged constantly for 10 years now, with pretty much every conspiracy theory possible, claims that it was a fad, a ponzi scheme, a scam, etc. Then there was a short stage where every bitter complacent old school economist was calling it dead until they finally realised it's not going away. Then there were the hacked exchanges, and the whole Mt Gox thing which painted Bitcoin in a negative light. Yet Bitcoin is thriving so .. yeah it's resilient alright!

That's a huge assumption. How long have they been holding out of the past decade? Did they start holding at $500? $2k? They they just get in on this in 2017 at 15k when it spiked for a little while?

Fawk no lol. It goes up, it goes down, and again and again. I have bought it at many price points, and if you DCA you stay in the green, giving it at least 3 to 4 years. I have what I like to think is a very diversified investment portfolio and I include Bitcoin because when it moves, it's fast and furious and brings a level of excitement that boring slow moving stocks and properties can't deliver. 
I wouldn't have it any other way. I do not want to be trying to time it, I just work in the tech space and I love the potential of Bitcoin. I can't imagine not having some stake in it. You don't buy an emerging asset or disruptive technology after it has already emerged and disrupted lol. The opportunity is to buy it before and take the risk. 
But to be clear, I don't reccomend anyone invest money in Bitcoin that they can't afford to risk, and I don't reccomend anyone invest if they don't have the stomach for volatility.
@_date: 2019-12-16 22:19:59

Exactly. This time last February, media highly impacted the price. Bear markets end with selling being exhausted and new buyers being hesitant. So the price moves sideways until people feel safe to jump in the water and then the next bull cycle begins. Rinse and repeat!

@_date: 2019-12-20 23:59:04
I believe it's because what you're calling an echo chamber is simply a shared perspective of support for Bitcoin and its potential. That really should not be overly surprising - that the majority of people who would be spending their time in a community sub for their topic of interest would be posting positive comments. 
If you visited a sub for the art collector's community, it would be likely that most comments will be pro art collecting lol. It's not like you need to like or even read the comments that don't align with your stance. But if you visit the sub and start speaking negatively about their shared interest, they may not respond kindly.
@_date: 2019-12-15 00:27:46
You need a lot more than 10 years to change the way people store and transact money. Bitcoin is doing amazing in my opinion. 10 short years ago Bitcoin didn't even have a market price, and didn't for the first 2 years. Now we have governments talking about it, more on ramps than we can count, storage companies, huge mining facilities, the beginnings of layers and sidechains and so much more. 
If you've lived for long enough and seen how previous technologies have evolved, then you understand it takes generations and this general pessimism is a very normal part of the growth. If you want to invest, do it when there are still pessimists claiming thier doubts like you are, not after it's taken off! If it doesn't pan out well, hey you need to take a risk here and there. 
Personally I have never felt more confident regarding Bitcoin's role in the future, but I welcome views like yours because they create the opportunity to profit as soon as within the next decade.
@_date: 2019-12-28 20:45:27

@_date: 2019-12-17 13:43:18
Depends on your personal investment goals. I've worked in the tech field all my life, so from a technology and development perspective, I have always had my sights set on around the year 2025 for when Bitcoin will really have enough functionality and surrounding infrastructure to really start taking hold in society. 
So in my opinion, any time is a good time to buy. Between now and then I believe the price will continue to trend up but you get these huge price swings along the way, and that's because the reality is for it is largely speculation on Bitcoin's future success that is driving the price. 
If you buy just hang tight and don't buy only once. Instead buy small amounts in regular intervals over time to catch most price points.  The building has only really just started with regards to surrounding infrastructure and layers, etc. Hang tight, enjoy the ride and good luck!

Lol, yeah sure ... get rich scheme. Is that really what you think of Bitcoin and it's community? Shows how little time you took to be informed before you commment. 
Your kind of perspective has been a constant in this space for years and your need to be pessimistic has extinguished your need to be informed. The development of Bitcoin's protocol is open source and takes a long time. Nobody in their right mind would call this a get rich quick scheme...well other than the trolls and naysayers lol, which are who seem to be the only ones to be saying it this past 5 or 6 years. Bitcoin has to take a long time to mature, certainly longer than 10 years. But at least we now have a decade of data establishing Bitcoin as a solid, secure base layer we can build on top of. The next decade will be very interesting.

Good things come to those who wait. Most of us that have been here a while understand the value of patience in all this. If you are in a rush for bitcoin to hit a new ath, ask yourself why you wish this. What's the rush? If you need the money that badly perhaps you invested more than you could afford to without stress. The longer we have to accumulate at these prices the better...within reason of course. The more bitcoin you own when mass adoption/ownership occurs, the better off you'll be. You want overnight riches? Buy a lotto ticket. The good things in life require time and smart decisions.

Wish I knew! I'm fairly confident large players sell once they've established that there is no rally left in the current year - that way they can claim capital losses on taxes, buy the Bitcoin back cheaper than they sold it for in the new year and ride it up throughout next year. 
If you think about it, why else would they sell end of year like this, when they could have sold for 12k, 10k, hell even 8k?

Once you ride it down and DCA a few times you get used to it. The thing is nobody knows how low it will go before it reverses. Once you buy it all the way down, you will thank yourself immensely (and I can't stress this enough) because once the price starts climbing back up, you create gains very quickly.
In 2017 it was as low as sub 1k, in 2018 it was as low as 3200, earlier this year 3500, and as long as you DCA and yearly lows keep rising it's a no brainer.

Security is where bitcoin shines. Fees and speed can be improved over time, but the disappointment of Bitcoin's use as currency is outweighed by it's incredible potential as a store of value. You don't need speed for that. It seems pretty much established that cryptocurrency will play a significant role in the future of our economy, and bitcoin is the gold of crypto. Use as a mainstream currency can easily come later.

Based on everything you said, it is my opinion that you should not buy Bitcoin :). 
You are just as biased in the opposite stance as those who think of Bitcoin as a get rich quick opportunity. Both opinions miss the reality of just the fact that its already happening. All stuff takes generations to happen. 
I've been following 3D printing for years, and the same point applies there as well. It is happening, but the wheels of adoption turn slow when the actual product or service needs to evolve and fulfill its full potential with the help of ingenuity and skilled coders and engineers.

No...no it does not. There was enormous pressure on Wednesday's run up, and people watch for opportunities to take profits and then chain selling, FOMO exit occurs. Yes, this is a new market and big players make more impact by simply being a larger percentage of the whole. But they don't control it to the extent that you seem to believe. To be realistic, it wasn't even to that extent back in 2015 or 2017 either. You seem very misguided.

Only if you're brain dead - anyone that has bought over a 3 year period, during ANY 3 years of Bitcoin's existence has grown their wealth slowly. But your first statement is true.
@_date: 2019-12-09 21:54:06
That's not what I was referring to, but I'm sure that there are plenty of people who got in early who cash out some hefty chunks when the price is right sure. That's an inevitable part of a young market. A lot of the bitcoin held in large amounts has never moved in years though.
It's thriving in the sense that for the first 2 years, Bitcoin never even had a market price. Somehow though, it grew to what is now looking like a serious contender for a value store for the next generation, and one day perhaps even a main stream alternative currency once the infrastructure is built. It's thriving because the mining industry and the development community around it have never been stronger. The third party infrastructure, investment and growth among investment products, storage companies, apps, exchanges, hardware vendors, etc. has never been bigger. The development of layers and sidechains on top of the the Bitcoin base layer protocol have never been more active. Lighting network is just the beginning, and is not bad for a first try. 
Now that Bitcoin's protocol has had a decade to prove itself as a solid secure base, the building is beginning. There's a lot more to Bitcoin than the crytpo market. A hell of a lot more.
By the way, if there's a cohort of regular buyers to snatch up what those holding large balances are selling, that's a good thing. It's slowly creating a better distribution which is necessary for long term success. I mean if I'd bought up a pile of Amazon shares at 10 bucks back in the day, I'd have been selling them off to new buyers and securing some gains too. Long as there are more buyers, I don't see how this is a problem. In fact, I'd even call that thriving :).
@_date: 2019-12-17 14:10:23

Naw that has nothing to do with Bitcoin's price going down or up. You really believe for a second that's why Bitcoin was under $1000 less than 3 years ago, and now it's over 6k? Or why it even spiked up to 20k for 5 minutes that one time? Of course not lol. 
It's a speculation like gold, and perhaps a part of that speculation has to do with Bitcoin's future use as currecy, but all the money, effort and time being poured into Bitcoin and its surrounding infrastructure lately has been geared towards its potential as a macro asset. Currency comes later, once enough people own it. Don't worry, Bitcoin isn't going away. There's a huge industry growing around it.

You don't invest much do you? Bitcoin is the least of my investments, I'll admit, but it's provided me with the highest yield returns by extreme margins... well except for a rental property I sold, that was unique circumstances lol.
You see, it has nothing to do with how much higher it was for 5 minutes when it hit 20k. It has to do with how disciplined you are as an investor. If you purchased the same amount of Bitcoin once a week since January of 2017..and that's only 3 years, many have been doing this much longer, then  most of the time you buy you'd have paid way below 6k. Right now you'd have tripped your money.
Don't ever just buy an asset at it's high price and hope for some day to come when it goes there again, that's not smart. Bitcoin goes up and down over years because it's a great investment, and people are buying and selling it. That's what makes a good investment,  somehthing with a price swing you can profit from, but if you hold it for 3+ years you also profit. If it fills both those attributes it's a great investment and Bitcoin does. 
I hope you can go learn a little more about this because there's a lot of money to be made out there. At the very least, rid yourself of the mindset of price high = good, price low = bad. Replace it with a mindset of long term for holding with regular buys, or short term for trading and price volatility. Otherwise you're going to find yourself just criticizing assets like Bitcoin everytime they drop, revealing to everyone else just how little you understand. 
I hope that helps! Nobody else is reading this thread, it's yesterday's, so I honestly am just trying to shed some light for you on why so many people still buy and trade Bitcoin even though this past 6 months weren't upward price movement. Good day.

It's like most technology - Once the development breaches the threshold where its use provides easy to identify advantages to the average person, the demand will increase, and the price along with it. The last few bubbles were speculation driven, and that may even drive the next one. But like all tech we will get there, and for now, accumulation in small regular buys still seems to be the best strategy regardless of all this looking for signs and signals stuff. Because once this thing kicks in, I mean really kicks in, there will be no more buying bitcoin sub 20k. Let the builders build, buy when you can, and ignore the trolls and their ignorance.
@_date: 2019-02-09 12:27:42

I don't see anything toxic about it. I just think many of the posters on Reddit are young and often say things that come from the excitement of potentially making gains. I've seen a lot young people spend their money on so very much worse things than bitcoin, and at least bitcoin gives back every few years. Plus this gets them used to the concept of putting some of their income aside and teaches that tech developments take time. It's all positive from my perspective.

Most of the greatest innovations of the past century gained mass adoption for something quite different than what they were originally conceived for. Bitcoin just happens to hold strong potential for multiple purposes, including digital gold,  assest class and currency. And this thing is only getting off the ground. Who knows what other purposes bitcoin may serve over the next few generations?

Well, hopefully you learned about the benefits of buying low and not during the top of a run up. Bitcoin has been the best investment out there with the exception of a few months out of 10 years. You'll occasionally see people post on here that have been on here for months and longer who bash bitcoin... they bought the top and are jaded and biased. Because let's face it, you don't hang out in a Reddit sub for something you think is useless right? They desperately want others to feel how they feel.... miserable. Don't be one of them.

That's your random prediction right to make lol. I see Bitcoin maturing as a marco asset in the next decade or so, because that's where the millions are spent currently in terms of efforts to grow the surrounding infrastructure.
The difference in money and currency is that money must be able to store value as well as transact. 
I have believed since long before 2017's hype spike in price, that we're looking at at least a decade or more of value store use, and then once enough people own bitcoin, once the protocol has enough developent, functionality and bandwith, and once the infrastructure for onramps, wallets, conversions and user friendly apps are built...then we'll see currency use. Guess we'll find out over the next decade!

Do you watch Altcoin Daily? Those guys are among the best quick fix content on YouTube. They shill nothing, and provide the good, bad and ugly. Despite their channel title, they talk mostly Bitcoin fundamentals and review latest news in the space.
Also, there have been multiple other very good channels affected by this that talk very little about price. It's not that what you are saying is wrong, it's just that you clearly are making assumptions about content you haven't even watched and then making a blanket, generalized statement. Please don't do that, we have enough of that going on already.

We're going through price discovery and will be for a long time to come. Asking that is like asking can anything go to zero. What value is there in me confirming that Bitcoin can go to zero if we don't clarify that it is exceptionally unlikely given the past decade of events? So yeah, if there is catastrophic failure in the network (which again, would have been uncovered by now), or if the internet goes down, or if there is an apocalypse, then sure it can go to zero.

That's the concept of investing money in any market. You hope you bought lower than future prices, but it's the not knowing that keeps the market wheels spinning. Because there's no possible way to know, i prefer to DCA to catch potential bottoms and lower average buy. it works very well in a market like this. To be honest I use DCA in most of my investments, not just Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-02-07 15:49:14
Well with regards to what I'm referring to above, the general sentiment was that Bitcoin was 100% dead. There was no way in hell it was ever going to rebound in the aftermath of Mt Gox. Trolls had a field day with us 'bitcoin extremists' which was a ridiculous way to view people who invested in something they felt had a strong future. But the general public view was to stay away from bitcoin, that it was a fad, a scam, a poison, etc. Then a few years later boom... people don't stay away, they jump back in the game because they realized this was here to stay. In my opinion, if Bitcoin survived that period then the ICO bubble and bear market we're in now is a joke.

Because bitcoin has proven that it works, is solid and secure af. What "other" blockchain is there? I mean what other blockchain that could provide any data on how well it works?? This is the reason the China news has been so positive for bitcoin. China's president didn't even mention Bitcoin, but we all know what it means when more and more people advocate for blockchain the older and more secure bitcoin becomes. It's basically a confirmation of legitimacy for bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-12-13 19:34:36
These points have been brought up multiple times over the years and we slowly see improvements, infrastructure growth, awareness and development increase. There is only one thing that Bitcoin needs, and it will get it - TIME. Maybe for a new iPAd 10 years seems like a very long time, but to see mass adoption of an entirely new asset class/currency over an entirely new digital ecosystem? Ten years is only a drop in the bucket. TIME.
@_date: 2019-12-16 22:14:47
Lol of course not.  Once something continues to be developed past 5 or 6 years, you can no longer call it a fad, or dead, or whatever. There's a core update released every 6 months and the dev community are strong.
In terms of the functionality that will likely be added to Bitcoin, the next decade looks very promising. I know you're referring to price, but there's loads of potential for the price to go far higher than 2017. You just have to be reasonable with regards to your time frame.
@_date: 2019-02-06 14:00:42
There is no floor, no set rules, no price guarantee. You got some money you want to put into a risk investment for potential high reward? Buy some bitcoin and ride it out!
Let the builders build, and let the innovation thrive. Eventually the technology will bring advantages to the average person and the demand would increase. Just like all tech of the past, except this is much bigger since we're dealing with a global currency and value store for future digital society. It also may take much longer to come into fruition because of political, regulatory, cultural and economical roadblocks. It will happen one day, but we'll all be much older.

Not in May, but if the payment to miners is cut in half but their expenses continue to escalate then it stands to reason that something has to eventually give. In past halvings the price has increased to  bridge that gap, but it takes time and usually occurs within a year or so.

The people you're referring to got in early or had a large sum of money to play with (money makes money). If you're looking to make a quick buck then go to Vegas, flip houses, work hard at a lucrative day job, etc. If you want to make a lot of money on a long term bet on bitcoin then accumulate when you have some extra cash and in 5-10 years from now there is a very good chance that you will have an exceptional return on your bitcoin investment. Be realistic - these are early days for crypto. Play the long game.

Things are very very different than they were in 2017 when exchanges had to turn thousands of people away because they could not handle the volume of new user sign ups. Now days the major Exchanges are ready, there are easy to use apps, and the process of buying bitcoin in general is significantly easier. I get why you like to lay out the future as though you had a crystal ball and you're not the only one speculating and presenting as fact, but the reality is there's no possible way any of us can know if Bitcoin will drop back down that much after the next ATH or not.

@_date: 2019-12-04 12:02:23
Don't worry, this has been thought about. It was discussed and debated and beat to death years ago. We're good:). 
Just remember the protocol has a decade of data to support it now and while you certainly don't have to take my word for it, I can assure you things will start building a much faster pace during the next decade. Well it already is if you jave been following the update details and can see past the "number down, bad...number up, good" point of view haha. 
Yes the algorithm needs to change...it's not nearly as big of a deal as you think. Imagine TCP had never changed or if ipv6 didn't come along after ipv4 was getting tired. Or if Windows 3.1 hadn't upgraded multiple times over the past almost 40 years, etc. But at the end of the day I have my point of view based on a lifetime of working in the tech and networking space and perhaps you have a point of view from years of being a financial professional, whatever. Nobody knows the future. Just do me a favor and don't assume you needed to explain the basics of quantum computing to me next time :) Assumptions rarely help anyone.
I feel sure about Bitcoin continuing to evolve, in fact it feels almost inevitable with so many developments and new finds now coming out allowing easier onramps to invest. But hey, continue to be skeptical. In fact you skeptics in these very early days. You guys always play an important role in these scenarios.
@_date: 2019-12-03 04:37:53
But what if you bought it only at the ATH? Then you'd be down but that would have been dumb. Like crossing the road during rush hours when you have days to get across it kind of dumb, you know what I mean? That's not on Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-12-15 01:22:00
Fair enough. And you have every reason to be cautious...it's your hard earned money we're talking about, so you should be. The internet started as a small project in a very niche group of people back in the 60's remember. So if Bitcoin, which also started among a very small niche group, is already where they say internet was in the 90's, I'd say it's doing just fine. 
As for 20k, that was only for a very tiny fraction of Bitcoin's life, and was driven from fomo of people wanting to get rich quick. Naturally many who got in early made lots of profit and cashed out... to enjoy that profit. It's a market, thats expected. Just happens that it's a young market so big moves impact the price more. Also to be expected.
Development, trust and ease of use needs a lot more time and we're seeing all that slowly happen. As for making money, anyone that bought Bitcoin in regular buys over a 3 year period or more has made plenty of gains, and I see no reason why that would stop. All the best to you whatever you choose bud!
@_date: 2019-12-18 14:07:43
I have always seen it as speculation of future potential, and events unfolding at the time may add some fuel sure but overall people are always looking for a reason. Other than the halvings impacting supply flow, I see little substance in much else. Bitcoin is not affected by these things like a company on the stock market. It's pure speculation until the protocol is built upon to increase bandwidth and use case, and until the surrounding infrastructure is mature.
@_date: 2019-04-04 11:33:44
All I can say is that anyone with your perspective should simply not spend any money on Bitcoin. You're entire argument is built on as much speculation as the those who beleive it will hit 1 mil per btc. I have no issues with any of this, although you have a poor sense of understanding timelines involved with regards to how long this should take. Doubt bitcoin, hell... preach from the roof tops that's it's useless for all I care, but understand this: Your comparison to VISA and existing curency and platforms is not logical. IT WILL HAVE to take multiple generations for bitcoin to be used as a mainstream alternative currency. There's no way around it. People will literally have to be born and raised with it in their environment as part of their practices. Were not simply changing the way we use an existing fiat, we're changing the currency itself. 10 years is a joke, and the fact that you think 10 years should have seen adoption tells me you're either a kid will very little life experience,  or you are totally yanking my chain. I used to swipe credit cards in a carbon copy device in the 80s, and 90% of customers and merchants avoided using it because it was a pain in the ass. 35 years later we got a card tap system that's instant and using cash now seems slow. Yet you can't wrap your head around the possibility that in another 35 years bitcoin will have features you can't even imagine yet? Open your mind and get real with the time frame.
As I said this is an interest. I put a very small portion of my investments in crypto and would not miss a cent of it if it crashed and burned. However, if it goes as I suspect, I have enough btc to make a nice gain. Anyone that can fault that must have a pretty sweet life of their own.
@_date: 2019-12-27 17:28:08
I don't believe anyone who says anything about price - up or down. And the more confident they sound, the less I believe them. Like at 3200 when they said over and over it was going to 2k. So many people, so confident. Didn't  happen.

That depends on who you explain it to. It seems that you believe that because you don't see value, that means there is none.
Over time, issues of transaction speeds and energy consumption will be resolved. Your responses above are not helping your case at all. Fiat was put in place before the world became digitally connected, and before travel abroad was as frequent as it is. A currency accepted anywhere for both in person and online transactions, without the need for conversion, will see increasing demand.
Let's agree to disagree. You need to see present value, and I'm referring to the beginning of a future value that is in my opinion inevitable.
@_date: 2019-06-27 18:06:22

Everything you express points back to the exact same issue with your perspective - you only see how things are and refuse to be open mined. The limitations with fiat are very very simple. It has nothing to do with all these prosesses you are caught up in. You're just outlining the current system and praising how efficient it is now. Which I understand because it's natural to use the present as a measuring stick, and not the future. You almost sound like an accountant with your conservative stance. We're not here to evaluate your knowledge of how the current economy functions. I get it, you want to highlight that and I think it's great that you like to learn.
Bitcoin consolidates numerous processes within one ecosystem. Is that simple enough for you? The technology surrounding fiat is not fiat, it's third party tech. The limitation of fiat is that it will always rely on third party technology. Bitcoin comes packaged with everything needed onboard and can be scaled infinitely. It's ironic that you say I'm not close enough to the technology, when that's the exact component of bitcoin that you are neglecting to acknowledge. All the trusted third parties you refer to that are required in addition to the currency are not the middlemen I am talking about, and you know that. There will also always be a need to borrow, and there will also always be interest rates, and many other moving parts but again, this is irrelevant to the consolidated nature of bitcoin that I'm pointing out as making fiat inferior.
Stop hoping to learn anything from any crypto conversation until you're ready to acccept that bitcoin has graduated far beyond the fad stage, or the forgotten invention stage. It is here to stay and will morph and shapeshift countless times from the original satoshi whitepaper until it becomes what is the most efficient form. Don't you get it? Bitcoin can be made into exactly what we need, but fiat can only ever rely on third party tech to be improved. And that's not even involving the advantages of being global and decentralized. 
You sound like a senior who refuses to use modern tech because things work just fine the way they are. And that's your choice. You should do you, as should everyone. We're not here for a long time.

No, it's grown. Significantly.  There are 14,346 venues globally that take BTC as payment - Only 1,789 merchants that accepted bitcoin about six years back. The majority of that growth has happened in the past few years. And it's not even easy to use yet in terms of user friendly interfaces for retail purchases and wallet address/scanning etc.. Personally, I believe Bitcoin will surely succeed as a value store and investment before it succeeds as a mainstream alternative currency to traditional currencies. Eventually the currency use will thrive simply because the world is getting smaller due to technology, so a global language, currency, etc is inevitable. Bitcoin as streaming content money is the future.

No, vendors won't accept it until the onboarding software and infrastructure is FAR more user friendly than it is now and that's reality. But it's almost certain to happen over another decade or so. Society didn't ask for any of the communication tech we use regularly, until decades after initial concepts were introduced to early adaptors. 
Besides, the use case for a value store is going to materialize first. Bitcoin is the ticker on market platforms and it's getting a lot of integration with third party investment firms like Fidelity. More people are starting to consider parking some money in bitcoin as a hedge and simply another way to contribute to diversity. Time will see volatility decrease, gains become slower and steadier, and the store of value and investment use case develop first. Currency mainstream will be years away. Sorry if that disappoints you, but it's the way it is.

If it settles at 4500 that's a great gain for a few days. If it has to hit 5k to move from 3800 to 4500, that's northward movement. Nothing goes straight up folks. It's natural for there to be some profit taking!
@_date: 2019-04-30 22:07:50
It's pretty straight logic... It definitely doesn't prove an artificial price. You are asuming that if tether didn't exist they wouldn't have purchased the bitcoin via another payment, be it fiat or another crypto. You can't know that. There are also loads if variables to consider, the frozen line of credit issue being just one.
In any case, 74% is way higher than the fed... WAY higher. So while one may say, that doesn't make it right, one does have to accept that in the playing field, it would be pretty absurd to condemn tether when they are batting a hell of a higher average than the banks :).

Jan 2015 Bitcoin price started going sideways for about a year, until it slowly ramped up toward the halving in mid 2016, then from there slowly ramped up until late 2017 when it spiked abnormally on all the hype. Sideways action before a halving is expected as the period is generally treated as an accumulation stage and a time when traders speculate and trade small margins. We just have a hell of a lot more margin trading these days.

@_date: 2019-12-18 02:20:28
You had months and months....and months to buy between 3.2k and 6k, in the past 12 months alone....and you're saying you've lost on Bitcoin? Something's very wrong with that. Now is the time to buy, just like it was last December, and now you're going to miss it
...again lol.
@_date: 2019-04-06 14:54:34
If you consider it as "wasting" your money then probably not. If you're willing to accept it may go on a roller coaster ride that you're OK with riding for at least a few years, then it could give you a great return. Personally, I never buy a large amount at once, because I prefer to make smaller purchases over time and try to catch lower prices during dips. 5k may drop again before it goes higher or it may continue to climb from here. Nobody could possibly know.
@_date: 2019-04-08 23:33:14
Your patience is being tested waiting for 4k, when it was just in that range and below for months? Just hold on until we go back to B&amp;W TV and dial up internet. Shouldn't be too long, hang tight.
@_date: 2019-04-03 12:39:26
To be specific, currently, there are 14,346 venues globally that take BTC as payment - Only 1,789 merchants that accepted bitcoin about six years back. The majority of the growth has happened in the past year.
Now that being said, I realize this is still a small number, but it's not even easy to use yet. And as I try to keep reminding people, Bitcoin will surely succeed as a value store and investment years before it succeeds as a mainstream alternative currency to traditional currencies. Eventually the currency use will thrive simply because the world is getting smaller and due to technology, so a global language, currency, etc is inevitable. 
@_date: 2019-04-04 12:30:36
I'm not "that' old ha ha. Things ramp up, so I'm guessing it will slowly progress and within the next decade there would be obvious signs of that progress. Point being that the investment opportunity is now, while there are still folks that think it's not going to happen.
@_date: 2019-12-16 22:15:36
You should have bought it at 3200. Sorry man.

@_date: 2019-12-04 12:07:12
No I mean all they had to do was DCA. Just buying during all those months on the 3k range would have recovered their investment easily. People forget it was only 20k for a few minutes lol. Most of Bitcoin's life it has been much lower than it is now.

You should have yes, but that ship may have sailed.
@_date: 2019-04-10 20:09:06
But I remenber they made a difference, particularly when they had a juicy run of bad events to run with in their stories. They just had more impact on the entire space in general than they do today. I would chalk it up to prolonged exposure increasing immunity lol.

He's desperate for views and knows that bitcoin supporters are a huge number of people. No way he's stupid enough to really believe what he's written there. Remember, those articles pay him for views and ad clicks. Pretty shady way to get user engagement.

Is that code for something, or did you pick random words and numbers out of a hat?
@_date: 2019-12-18 14:17:41
Not sure how you can say that. It's almost as though you're saying that you can price in the impact of reducing the supply while mining expenses remain the same and increase. You can't do that, and that's why the price coils up and increases durimg the year after as that supply tightening is felt.
LN is a great first effort, and came sooner than many thought, but I don't believe for a second that it represents all the layering that we're going to see on Bitcoin that will blow LN out of the water. Remember TCP!
@_date: 2019-04-10 11:02:36
It's always been this way. China has pulled this kind of thing multiple times over the years. They realize that most people are sheep, and too lazy to look deeper than the surface on the majority or world issues. So they use media to rally the troops, and sensitive issues like climate change make it easy to get people onboard. They've announced some sort of ban pretty much everytime bitcoin starts to show strength. 
What's impressive is the negativity that bitcoin has survived through since its inception...that kind of negativity would have obliterated the largest companies in the world. Yet bitcoin just gets stronger and stronger.
@_date: 2019-04-05 02:24:58
It's as itos said in the comment below. If you buy in smaller increments all the way down, you'll catch the bottom, lower your average buy, and start recovering much sooner when the price is headed north again.
@_date: 2019-04-07 14:53:28
You guys sure seem to love forking. Imagine how much further ahead we'd be today if your greed project had never existed.
@_date: 2019-04-04 18:43:53
^ Exactly. Nothing goes straight up. If it did I'd be very concerned about the fall that follows. Hitting 5k to settle anywhere above $4500, after being at $3800-4k just days ago is an incredible gain.

I have no major arguments with this, and I personally have no issues with using my credit card when I travel either. I like points :).
But as a technology, it may or may not surprise you how many stops and verifcations from third parties our credit card transactions have to pass through. While the individual doesn't care much about these background processes, it is natural for cheaper more efficient processes to win in the long term. I definitely see a place for bitcoin where it can simplify the execution and maintenance of global transactions.
Also, just worth noting, there are several apps that allow you to buy bitcoin without all the hassles you mentioned. They verify you with your cell phone number, and you can download the app and buy up to $2000 of bitcoin all within minutes. The fees are slightly higher than coinbase, but negligible considering the convenience. I see these types of apps becoming far more common.
Thanks for your answer about where you see things going long term. Both of our opinions are speculative but make for interesting conversation.
@_date: 2019-04-09 10:38:43
Nobody knows, but a drop back to 3500 seems highly unlikely. There's always going to be new buyers who would like a lower entry point, but that doesn't mean it will drop that low.
With bitcoin, nothing surprises me anymore. If it drops, I'll buy some for less. If it stays the same or rises I'll grab some then too. Long game for me.
@_date: 2019-12-18 19:00:25
This is the best and most accurate comment on Reddit today. That is all.

That guy has been posting under various user names and doing the exact same crap for ages. He posts something babbling and pretending to be an intellectual, then deletes his posts after. Perhaps he reads it back and realizes how stupid it sounds lol.
@_date: 2019-04-30 21:42:53
Definitely not. That would be an assumption, not proven fact. How is it any different from the way banks use fractional-reserve? By that I mean it's only an issue if Tether can't cover the 26%. Also, that 26% would be across the entire crypto space with only a small portion being bitcoin. And on top of all that, I can't recall any other time beside 2017 that tether printing has ever aligned with a significant hike in Bitcoin's price. To be honest I could care less about 99% of altcoins. It's usually when crypto is dropping that demand for tether increases, because large players don't want to liquidate to fiat, so they move into tether as a tool to buy back into crypto on the dip.
@_date: 2019-12-20 18:25:17
Ironic, since this is one of only a few toxic posts I've seen here in a while.
@_date: 2019-04-13 20:41:52
Lol, sure. Ten years later it's dead. Must be just one of those fads that gets stronger and stronger each year. It's like that internet thing and that crazy cell phone fad, am I right? Come back in anther year man.
@_date: 2019-12-05 20:00:35
I disagree. Social media has become a place where free speech is encouraged, yet if you don't word everything perfectly and walk on eggshells the over sensitive people start attacking like a pack of wolves. The man travels the world constantly and clearly welcomes diversity. He is simply saying he'd like a more diverse list of options here. That does not make one racist.
@_date: 2019-04-25 15:51:55
We went from 3k range to 4k range. Then from 4k eange to 5k range. Do you see any reason why this trend won't continue into the 6k range? Many thought they'd have the entire year to accumulate below 5k. They may have been very wrong.
@_date: 2019-12-01 14:11:19
Why? Bitcoin is much more sought after, has historically had better results than LTC during the year following a halving, and has a monumentally larger mining infrastructure. BTC price has more than doubled since the start of the year and has held its gains firmly, 
even spiking to 13kish at one point. LTC has not performed nearly as well, even in its halving year. Comparing the 2 doesn't even make sense.
@_date: 2019-04-10 10:18:16
There was definitely hype and there may always be...just as there is hype with stocks.
But so long as there is advancement within bitcoin itself as a technology and also advancement in third party support, there will also be valuation based on growing demand. 
Bitcoin continues to grow in these ways year over year, and the growth increases. The number of exchanges, apps, participants, etc. has grown far more in the past 5 years than it did in in the first 5. So it's certainly far more than a "bowl of hot air".
@_date: 2019-04-06 02:57:18
This reddit account only participates in bitcoin related posting. It's a very tiny fraction of my life. But you are free to percieve and believe as you will. It is irrelevant to me, though I have enjoyed your persistant reistance to an inevitability. It at least uses logic, and I believe that you honestly mean what you say. These conversations provide insight into the last wave of mindset that will hang on to the end.
All transactions are already accounted for. Well legal ones anyway. Bitcoin just provides a much more efficient means of accounting.  Math and consensus don't exactly hurt here.
Almost everything that has succeeded is an example of my point. Bitcoin is not a business so it won't go out of business, although there are many businesses that thrive off of the residual effect of it's existence. Do you think people welcomed the internet for the first while? Think they asked for it before it was a thing that eventually became easy to use? What about all these new payment features? Did I ask for a  new version of my credit card with the tap feature before it showed up in my mail? Did we ask for any of this before it was created? No. It was not demanded by consumers because consumers didn't even know these things existed until they were integrated. Now bitcoin has an advantage even though it doesn't have the commercialized marketing. It has an open source, made by the people, for the people, and maintained by the people thing going on. Marketing will never compete with that in the long term.
@_date: 2019-04-22 20:18:26
I agree with this. The overall trend that preceeded any lingering price has almost always been critical when trying to peg the following movement.
@_date: 2019-12-16 02:25:05
Ahhh, sorry thought you meant this sub. I guess you could assume Bitcoin began as an experiment, hard to say that definitively though. It was the output of creative programming too. Experiments are premeditated as experiments. 
The merging of peer to peer exchange with currency to form a protocol for globally owned and operated form of money that can attract wealth as a store of value for this new digital society. I believe there will be fascinating new use cases built on this Bitcoin protocol over the next decade. We'll see how it goes.
@_date: 2019-04-11 10:37:12
I did. Several times. There are many advantages, but even the one I mentioned above regarding a global currency that is accepted anywhere and online for digital puchases without any conversion would probably be enough to see it succeed as an alternative. Something costs x amount of btc, regardless who you are or where you are. 
For many years, all that was said about cars was that they were ridiculous, could never go where horses can, and that they spooked horses. They never invented the roof until much later :).
Why would you call it blind faith? It's not personal, and I'm not putting faith in something that will have any consequences for me or my well being. It's just an observation and an interest, that happens to provide me with great content for a small portion of my work.
How about you tell me something? The growth of Bitcoin's technology, layers, developments team, etc. and its third party support with exchanges, apps, merchants, investment platforms, etc. Is growing and has been for years.  That growth is increasing year over year regardless of the price on the crypto market. So what do you see happening? Do you think that after the past ten years of growth from nothing to the entity it has become, that the growth will suddenly halt? Do you think it will suddenly reverse and slack off over the next decade? Do you see a potential catastrophic failure in the code? Ten years in it no longer falls into the fad or failed invention category.
@_date: 2019-04-22 12:25:25
No, though it may be the catalyst that eventually prevents one.
@_date: 2019-04-02 23:22:22
So how many people are feeling FOMO and how many believe this will drop back before it climbs higher? It never really went back to $3300, so there's a good chance it won't return to $4300 either.
@_date: 2019-12-15 00:32:21
Remember the last 2 halvings? Think about what a halving does in this network ecosystem and how it takes the year or so after the event to impact price.
@_date: 2019-04-07 18:17:13
Wha? Banned for what? And where have I trolled? You post gibberish that has little to nothing to do with bitcoin and I pointed it out. You resort to name calling and bizarre unrelated comments. Maybe you should take ownership. But back to banning, no I did not in any way suggest you be banned. If you've been banned in the past, I assure that had nothing to do with me.
@_date: 2019-04-23 14:56:06
Many people have a poor understanding of how tech evolves and integrates with society. The fast pace of iPhone upgrades has created false expectations of fast turnaround. Bitcoin is not the same as a simple upgrading of existing tech. This is currency and disruption we're talking about. The reality is that ten years is a drop in the bucket, and bitcoin is barely even off the ground compared to how massive this space will eventually become.
@_date: 2019-04-09 23:55:33
Are you the same guy that told us that in 2014-2015? You'd think by now you'd have strengthened your math skills! Of course timing your exit is critical, and there will always be winners and losers, just like stocks. However... think ahead to when there will likely be millions more people purchasing bitcoin for multiple transaction types. As volatility lowers, and it's a one in, one out scenario. Until then though, yeah, it's about timing the exit.  So it's either sell higher, or hold much longer.
@_date: 2019-04-10 00:42:46
I believe that day will absolutely arrive, but I'm not certain I will live to see it. The negativity towards bitcoin is like a cancer for innovation and if you listen to a large percentage of people, that negativity and lack of vision is rampant. It's been this way throughout centuries of innovation. It may take several generations for bitcoin to fully thrive.

Not sure where you got that info. More merchants have accepted it in this past year than in the past 5 years. Search traffic is actually up significantly, with the exception of that weird late 2017 spike, but hey that's not what people should be judging the past decade on. The ICOs were simply the byproduct of any great disrupting innovation. They tried to emulate Bitcoin's success, and if anything showed the world that bitcoin is the real deal. Now with real money and real entities getting involved I believe the next 5-10 years will see the real growth phase where things will start becoming easy for the average user to adopt. It seems right on par with where it should be.
If not than I guess I'll have one less interest and no big deal. But I'm pretty sure I'm right about bitcoin. Again though, where did you get your statistics? They seem very skewed by that one small period of time in 2017.  
@_date: 2019-04-08 11:47:26
They've been selling at key points for years and have made a heck of a lot more money than me (the guys I know personally I mean), as I am far more conservative and still put the majority of my investments in stocks and real estate. My bitcoin and future tech indulgence is more interest than monetary. Well, my career is based around it all but my businesses are a different type of investment.
@_date: 2019-04-28 02:50:03
Lack of fundamental value? What did you just crawl out from under a rock and learn about bitcoin from one of those click bait articles? 
You're a few years behind it seems. We've already had the no fundamentals argument. Cute that you think 7 years in stocks makes you credible though!
@_date: 2019-04-10 19:26:09

@_date: 2019-12-14 14:29:17
That depends on how much you buy at 3k if that actually ever happened (I highly doubt it could drop below 6k range).
@_date: 2019-04-28 12:48:32
This has been explained and debated for years. So if you are not getting a lot of responses, it's probably because we are tired of the same narrow minded questions that we've already addressed more times than I can count over the years. You mentioned "much further research", yet your question implies that you've done very little research.
Oh, and please don't downplay decentralization as though it's no big deal. Centralization is fiat's biggest limitation, and the more digitally connected this world becomes, the more secure a place for an alternative, globally accepted digital currency, asset class and value store becomes. Bitcoin's pow, hash power deflationary properties, dev team and security just happen to make it an excellent fit to be that alternative. Now after 10 years of growth with mega companies like Samsung, Fidelity, NYSE, and so many more getting involved, there is little room for doubt that bitcoin will contiue to evolve into the foreseeable future.
@_date: 2019-04-03 11:01:36
Ha ha ha...wow, you really do believe your own madness. Perhaps you've been hiding under a rock but there's a lot going on in the crypto space... although there is a "hurd" mentality of people who will call  bitcoin dead again. Like a moron who keeps touching a hot burner rather than learning how to use it to cook.
@_date: 2019-04-08 11:24:03
If you are being serious, then that would defeat the purpose of how bitcoin functions as a currency. Bitcoin can be broken down into 100,000,000 satoshis, so everyone will always be able to afford bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-04-06 21:41:38
Yep. That's because there are more buyers than sellers, and probably will be for the remainder of this year according to perspective of most people engaged in all this. Even the permabears are bullish.
@_date: 2019-04-30 20:05:07
Good? The fact is that fractional-reserve banking is a reality of the world we live in, so I'm not sure what on earth you even mean by that question. Banks have been using it to expand money supply for years. At least we know bitcoin will always be an alternative that can never be expanded. Always remember, bitcoin is not propped up by tether despite the rumors - bitcoin is the only reason tether exists.
@_date: 2019-06-05 18:31:37
It's just traders. They buy it back again, and they're good for the market. They multiply in numbers and increase volume and price over time...which helps holders who also oncrease in number. They can continue to trade as the price increases and everyone wins. Play the long game if you hold and all is well.
@_date: 2019-04-08 15:51:56
Do you ever post anything actually related to bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-04-06 06:19:56
People don't want what they don't know is available. We've dicussed this, and now you're going in circles. People want it once it becomes obvious. As I have stated, this is already in motion and bitcoin will reach that point with the exception of some extreme circumstance that could impede history playing out it's current course, but it would require a very big disruption to prevent the evolution of bitcoin getting to the point you're referring to. As I've said, in my opinion this is inevitable. You're asking why anyone would want bitcoin is like asking why anyone would want a home computer before the GUI, a car before the vehicle and road systems were improved, or streaming services when DVDs were all the rage.
Tangent: don't get me started on streaming subscription services - I preached that streaming would replace the way people consumed music and movies, and so many called me crazy. When Netflix stopped home DVD delivery I argued it was a smart move to get a head start, and even my tech colleagues said I was wrong. Next up, streaming money as content,  and it's called bitcoin. 
I'm simply suggesting that you apply scaling to your vision of what is happening. Don't just judge based on the current scenario, because that scenario is rarely what opens future possibilities.
@_date: 2019-04-06 03:58:21
I've answered it. You just can't seem to break through your mental block of how things are, to see how they will become. You're not alone - it's been this way throughout history and all advancement has been a result of the minority out of the box thinking.
I have no idea why you'd use the phrase drunk the kool-aid. It implies I was won over by some hyped up concept or sold on some marketing agenda. I've been interested in bitcoin for quite a few years, and even today I remain objective, despite the fact that you assume that my opinion reflects bias. You mentioned my user name, and I told you it was a crypto content user name. I also had a different user account in 2014-2015 to discuss bitcoin on Reddit. There were people like yourself then too, who said that bitcoin had lost the interest of the public and was destined to fissile out and never increase in price. They said it was a fad (that one still makes me laugh out loud). Yet, here we are. I'm baffled that there's anyone who can simply look at all of this and not see where this road leads.

@_date: 2019-04-01 02:36:42
I don't disagree with any of that. But the stack of cash scenario applies to the digitization of society across the board, and doesn't really apply solely to bitcoin. As for banks folding, that's just nonsense tinfoil hat thinking anyway. I mean who knows way down the road, but bitcoin can succeed as an alternative payment method and as I have always said, its strongest potential lies with its value as a value store and hedge to contribute to diversity.
@_date: 2019-12-18 22:35:18
How ever much you can invest comfortably, with the understanding that this is an exceptionally volatile asset. If you are not going to stress about it, and can stomach watching your investment get cut in half one month but also potentially double the next month.... that's the amount to invest.
@_date: 2019-04-05 16:35:03

Tether is a trading tool. It was supposed to dry up about 50 other times. Will this be the time? How long do you think it would take for one of the many alternative stablecoins to take the top spot? In any case ... what happens to bitcoin? Nothing that will be a reflection of tether, we know that.

@_date: 2019-04-05 02:36:48
That question has a very logical answer. All the things you have referenced as what's happening in the regular payments space is not happening with fiat. It's happening with the payment methods and technologies of exchanging, and accounting for fiat. No matter how incredible these technologies may seem to become, fiat is still the currency. And when it comes to comparing fiat to bitcoin, as a currency, bitcoin is superior. It's IS the payment system, and the accounting and maintenance. It is the storage and limited supply. It is the currency and all the required arms to make it efficient. It literally eliminates the enormous expense of unnecessarily complicated and compromising middleman parts. 
Fiat can not possible compete with this over the long term. Bitcoin probably will not replace fiat in our lifetimes, but we will live to see it become an equally preferred alternative.

My favorite thing about this pump is that it's kind of an "in your face" and middle finger to the China FUD. Gone are the days that a spammy click bait article can make a difference. That gives me hope that people are starting to do their own research.
@_date: 2019-04-30 19:54:43
Which is leaps and bounds over what the FUD had led everyone to believe. I am no big tether supporter but I absolutely despise the scare tactics trolls have used when spreading the whole "bitcoin is propped up with tether" bullshit to try and frighten people away from the space.
The reality is that tether is a trading tool, and a damn utilized one. When they print more tether, it has always coincided with demand for its use. As an example, when alts drop by far more value than bitcoin increases, and the demand for tether spikes, is that really so difficult for trolls to comprehend?
@_date: 2019-04-12 04:44:28
None if what you're saying about swift and these great new payment technologies is an argument to Bitcoin's future. These technologies are not the competition. They're the third parties that can merge with bitcoin to create a powerful digital economy. 
Even with international payments there's still conversions and multiple verifications and non synchronized parts that make it messy.
When modern payment tech merges with the cryptocurrency ecosystem it will be scalable into centuries to come. The messy current system will linger and fade, like a phone book. The alternate combination of the two will thrive, no longer hindered by older currencies created before the world became digitally connected.
The reason I refer to Bitcoin more than general crypto is that I believe that regardless of how successful other cryptocurrencies are, Bitcoin is where many people will be storing a significant portion of their wealth. It will take time.

The concept is acceptable as a very slight possibility, based on the fact that the world has become more connected via modern transportation and internet, so other entities of society could evolve to cater to that new large and diverse system. But the reality is few countries can get along to the point of even being moderately civil. So that would be a very long time from now.

I don't bother much with those other coins. Bitcoin is the ticker on world markets, getting all the on ramps with investment corps like Fidelity, an it's the only one that sees real integration with third party software. It doesn't need to beat out PayPal or anything else. It just needs enough participants to feel it's a great hedge to park some dollars to diversify. Fixed supply experiencing more purchasing equals higher bitcoin price. That's why it's risen from a few cents to 4k this past decade, and unless all this integration with additional on ramping haults (which is near impossible at this point), then the movement will continue and the price will climb for years to come. I don't do a lot with it these days other than monitor it and average in. I have other crap to attend to lol. Good luck man!
@_date: 2019-12-17 12:55:07
I'm not living in past. You said since 2017 it's been garbage. Anybody can clearly see that we're all up since then if we bought regularly every week, 2 weeks, whatever. Average buy would be about 5k and nobody expected the gains that this year brought us, we were just accumulating... that was a bonus.

Just because you were one of the idiots in your lame little story one time, doesn't mean other people far smarter than you are not making money. If you think everyone believes they can get rich quick then you obviously are weak and easily led to believe stereotypes. Many of us just like the idea of putting some money into what is clearly a growing movement. 
Instead of regurgitating the same crap that we've heard for years now in a desperate attempt to be a blow hard know it all, you'd have been better off keeping your naive thoughts to yourself. But hey, you may not sound smart but you do sound like you actually believe your own crap anyway. Better to just be stupid than to be a troll, so at least you've got that right?

@_date: 2019-04-29 16:05:37
Nobody else can tell you that, since nobody knows your personal financial situation.
We do know though, that if you buy smaller amounts at regular increments that however low it drops, you'll catch the bottom and start making gains much sooner as the price increases.
We also know that bitcoin been growing and evolving for years and that the growth shows no signs of stopping, only accelerating. So whatever you buy at now, 5k, 3k, etc., there is a very high likelihood that it will be worth many times more as soon as within the next 5 years.
 Hold tight, accumulate, and don't try to time this kind of market unless you have money to burn. Good luck with it man!

Well, when you try to be an ambassador for something you believe is going to happen, proof is hard to come by.
Ripple is trying to be a crypto that gets earlier adoption because it integrates with fiat instead of threatening to offer an alternative to it. That's like coming up with a new way to distribute the hard copy newspaper. But who knows? By becoming useful earlier in the game, Ripple may create a catalyst that could catapult it well beyond the life of fiat and position itself for the tokenized economy of the future. Still, I believe bitcoin will be where wealty is stored, and bitcoin could be the currency bridge to all othe cryptos. Food for thought!

@_date: 2019-04-08 12:09:22
You've left out some key points and made inaccurate statements. 
First and foremost, loads of people involved can imagine what the benefit of bitcoin might be. That's really interesting,  how you refuse to acknowledge this. In fact, I thought I explained it fairly well to you. In short, modern payment methods are severely bottlenecked by fiat currency. Pairing the tech of modern payment methods with the tech of bitcoin not only removes that bottleneck, it provides infinite scalability into the future, because both are software and not vulnerable to the limitations of fiat. More importantly it removes enormous expense of middlemen. You really don't get this?
Regarding time frames, are you aware it took over 100 years for the car to be considered valuable?
Those 100,000 inventions and applications of ideas that never went anywhere... did they make world headlines on a daily basis? Rapidly grow from pennies to thousands in just 10 years? Still even exist with any merit in 10 years?
Look, you're in denial and the only thing that will change that is when it hits you straight in the face. That's fine, and if you're not working with bitcoin, invested in bitcoin, or looking to pay via bitcoin, then it makes no difference if your perspective is not on point, because whether you're right or wrong will have no impact. However, I would suggest that you avoid a career as  a fortune teller. :)
@_date: 2019-04-07 18:19:47
Then stop talking to me lol. It's not like I was trying to entertain you.
@_date: 2019-04-05 10:16:50
First of all, I'm not selling anything,  and if bitcoin and the entire crypto system dissapeared tomorrow it would have zero impact on my life, other than one of my many interests and investments would no longer be a thing. I love technology changes. I've come a long way from the gas station I used to run all those years ago.
Second of all, yes bitcoin is superior. Accounting has nothing to do with doing your taxes lol. I'm talking about accounting for every transaction in the world without paying a single cent to employ and house the millions of staff, equipment and real estate that costs an enormous amount of money. Many many times the cost of mining bitcoin that's for sure. You know what point you're missing? The fact that it's not about bitcoin  being better in a way that you or the consumer gives a shit about. It's about the more efficient solution across the board. What goes mainstream is NEVER what consumers or businesses request. It's what works better, and it takes time to materialize. As I explained to you before, nobody asked for today's bandaid, criss crossed payments tech with stripe or any of those. As messy as they are technically, they are best we can have currently with the fiat system. You're a perfect example. You think it's great because you don't realize the mess and unnecessary, convoluted steps that hapen on the backend. They then, cost more money to mitigate. And since bitcoin eliminates that mess, it will replace all this with a superior system, and one day you'll think that's great too. Although you seem pretty stubborn so you may pretend that it's not great. Lol. Good luck not investing man, but my advice? Take a chance occasionally...life is short. Seeing and acknowledging what's coming down the pipe in the future can reward you if you play it right. You don't need to take personally.
@_date: 2019-12-13 23:01:10
It doesn't matter what they do. They will NEVER be decentralized. The appeal of bitcoin is independance and decentralization. You're comparisons are not accurate because Bitcoin is nothing like some competing company trying to steal away a bank's market share or Visa's customers. Bitcoin is a completely different beast than anything before. 
Almost every concern or critique of  Bitcoin has been result of a lack of understanding that Bitcoin is not a company, is not a share, it is not a centralized currency, its 10 years of established stability and security it not going to be replaced by some whitepaper non tested currency. Bitcoin is a unique stand alone disruptive technology that can not be simply replaced, offers trustless transaction and has been growing since day 1.
@_date: 2019-04-09 10:14:04
Not just crypto. Innovative technology. It's a grey area though because my profession was primarily within IT and networking, but content creation and digital marketing have grown from a side gig to a much bigger venture for me.

I completely expected that response from you! The cynical usually resort to condescending behavior. It's like clockwork and sort of a pavlov's dog reaction to logic that doesn't align with their comfort zone.
It's so very much more complicated then just consolidation and compact efficiency of expensive resources. It's hardly possible to explain it in a Reddit comment, but when asked in public, I usually start with the fact that fiat is centralized, and that's the real limitation. The consolidation I mentioned allows global transactions to be efficiently logged in one decentralized ledger.
You still haven't even processed the idea that bitcoin isn't replacing fiat in our lifetime, but the world is no longer as it was. And this new digitally connected world absolutely needs a global currency as an ALTERNATIVE. 
Bitcoin will succeed as a value store first in my opinion. Anyway, you go back to your black and white world. I thank you for reminding me of the mindset that continues to challenge innovation...just as it always has.
@_date: 2019-04-13 01:17:47
Why do you think it's being held back? It wasn't even conceived as a concept until 2016, and didn't go live until a little over a year ago. I realize we expect instant gratification in today's workd of fast moving tech, but realistically, how much faster do you expect this to move?

The lower supply flow will most likely impact price over the year following the halving. This tightening of supply obviously takes time to be felt. It's not like some company stock recieved news of a partnership or good earnings report on the traditional markets. Bitcoin is supply and demand.

Shorting this market is a dangerous game. What's interesting is the attempt to make it seem like the tether thing had a negative impact on price. If media posts something often enough, there  are always some people who will believe it. The truth is though, the little step down in we had in price is no different than the step down we had early April. 1 step down, 2 steps up.

Bitcoin is only 10 years old and now the world is aware of it and it has become a regular topic in financial segments of huge news stations.  They didn't replace the internet, we've improved it. Same with cars etc. Bitcoin went from pennies to thousands in just 10 short years and is constantly being developed and improved by a growing development community. I'd hardly say it failed!!
@_date: 2018-11-30 21:02:23
Absolutely. If it can be successful as a store of value, then it will then be proven as able to function as a currency. Using your own example, an iPhone or OS can be integrated into mainstream use within several years these days, because it is merely a 'next step' to existing tech already used and the foundation has been laid.
Now if talking about currency, this is something that takes generations and generations to implement. Currency is embedded into the very fabric of our existence. As a child, what is the most recommended strategy for learning to count - currency! How many generation do you think it would take to shift the mindset to learning to count in Satoshi? To completely restructure, and reprogram the way existing purchases are made will take many many years. However, if bitcoin becomes utilized as a secure and mass adopted store of value, the use as a currency could be expedited by years. If you already have it, you're eventually more likely to spend it. But for now, in these EXCEPTIONALLY early days, the price could rapidly and dramatically change in one day due to the high volatility. So right now, at this point in time, whether you like it or not, Bitcoin is a high risk investment. That's a great start and I'll take it. Because one day many years from now, once the masses have stored wealth in Bitcoin, the price will settle after saturation of value-store adoption, and the volatility will level off. Then, and only then will most people be willing to spend this currency without having to worry that the Bitcoin they just used to buy that new TV now would be worth double had they kept it in their wallet. Nobody can blame a person for not wanting to spend it just yet.
So yeah, store of value works for me. I think it blows gold away as a store of value, and that more and more people will feel that way going forward. I might be right, I might be wrong, but that's my take on it.
@_date: 2018-11-19 19:16:03

There will be 4000 Bitcoin ATMs installed around the globe in about a week. This has grown rapidly and just the very beginning. We have companies like Fidelity,  Microsoft, Starbucks and more coming into the crypto space. This is the FIRST year we have seen that even being a possibility and there may even be ETF's launched within the next year. There are layering technologies like Lightning Network being implemented and improved upon, more coders joining the BTC dev community and far more user friendly interfaces being created.
So when you ask where I see this in a few years? For "ME", after working for years in IT, security, and digital marketing, it's a no-brainer - the space is maturing and will continue to grow for many many years to come. In that case, the price of the coin would have to catch up to accommodate relative pricing for the limited supply, assuming millions of investors jump in to the space. Once it becomes a strong investment that eventually stabilizes, it would then function as a store of value. Once the masses are using it to store value, the next step would be currency use. That being said, there are also some up-and-comers to keep an eye out for in the space as well, one of them being Stellar. Bottom line? Bitcoin is not going away and you really need to block out the dimwits on here saying stuff about how dumb it is etc.
It takes a long time for tech to merge into society. Want to see a realistic view of technology pricing in the market over time? Check out the Nasdaq Composite chart! Now consider that modern tech moves at a speed of about 5X faster (one year on the Bitcoin chart = approx 5 yrs on the composite chart). That will really give you lots to think about!

By accepting that we have to take Bitcoin's hard blows and painful lows if we want to take her high gains and ten year growth. People who are trolling on this sub and criticizing Bitcoin probably only bought it in the past year. People who are happy and bought it previous to last year are not on here whining. Bitcoin is growing but it's been cyclical since start. You don't see ETF's being proposed, New York Stock Exchange getting involved and the SEC taking things seriously if it were just tulips like the moron trolls post. They have little in life to make them happy, so they troll. Ignore them and look at the big piture - there's a very good reason why every time some increases in value, people say "only the lucky ones got in early". Trust me, this is early.

@_date: 2018-11-22 18:39:19
I couldn't agree more. This all started with technology and it will end with that technology being improved, expanded and integrated. The market is cyclical, BECAUSE of the technology growth. The infrastructure grows, the price catches up. The infrastructure pulls ahead again, then the price catches up. Anyone that can't see this are simply blinded by inflated prices that result from excessive hype. Too much too soon scenarios always need to pull back in markets, but in the long run there's been nothing but growth in both the tech and the price of BTC. 
Anyone who followed the simple rule of not investing more than they can afford should never be focused on the price too much anyway. Trolls think we're all over invested, but comments like yours help to provide insight that many of us simply enjoy following the tech evolution! I admit I'm a bit of a geek as an IT and network security admin, but you don't have to be a techie to enjoy following Bitcoin development. I'm looking forward to seeing what follows the market aspect - value store? alternative currency? Global ledger of financial records for a new gen? All?!

Poor example. That was one product from one company that fully expects that kind of turnaround and is on to the next product. Bitcoin is being developed ongoing and has been for 10 years.

Nobody can predict the future. Nor will you be here to validate your opinion, should it be a lucky guess. Blockchain wouldn't even be a discussion if it were not for bitcoin. Many people not directly involved in the coding community fail to realize that, which many of us blame on click bait articles that monetize their content via blockchain keywords to capitalize from the buzz. Knowledge is far more important than trend. 
@_date: 2018-11-23 15:42:22
It's called network value, and if you've ever ran a business or know someone who does, consider what they pay for a secure computer network. Now apply that value to a global network. Decentralized and not bound to any one country or region. Its accuracy impeccable, its stability more impressive than any other network on the globe. Its tamper proof features make other cyber security options pale in comparison.
The benefit of the options it provides to allow people to own a currency that is not ruled by any one country are endless. Speak with miners and investors that have been involved for at least 5+ years. Don't rely on these click-bait articles and statements from bankers and people heavily invested in the traditional system for your insight...OF COURSE they are going to down-play Bitcoin!
At the very least keep an open mind because the road ahead is a long one.

Code is better, dev community is better, this whole investment piece is easy to yet wrapped up in, but Bitcoin is much more than that...which is why the price continues to grow in the big picture.
@_date: 2018-11-28 00:01:42
You don't know shit so stop pretending you do. I don't either. The expert analysts don't know. Nobody knows. By saying "that's essentially gauranteed" you instantly become a talking turd with zero credibility. Who the hell are you even preaching to anyway? If anything the entire crypto market is speculation so buying in now makes a load more sense to buy than when it runs up to 20k like you clearly did! User name checks out anyway.
@_date: 2018-11-26 23:40:55
That depends on how accurate/lucky their calls are. Just because we're in a bear market, doesn't mean that shorting is a guarantee to profit at all. Shorts have expirations and are liquidated. If you catch a bad break on one of those pumps (which are impossible to predict) you lose.
@_date: 2018-11-26 23:50:37
Don't be silly. Tech doesn't attach to society that quickly it takes many years. Maybe if it was tech that was basically a 2.0 of existing technology but something as new and different as bitcoin needs more time to become user friendly and adopted. There's been no slow down in the dev community and market prices are just noise

About? Your successes or failures have zero impact on my day to day. To be honest I'd like to see everyone profit and thrive. But a price drop over time, even consistent down trend, does not make shorting any easier than an upwards price move over time and if you shorted you'd have to know that.

Misery loves company and the biggest fools think everyone in the crypto market is over invested.

Yes and it was far more "dead" then than anyone feels today. Naysayers will try to claim that last year was bigger and that now everyone is scared to re-enter the market but let me assure you people were far more concerned then. We had nothing to look forward to then, very little to even hope for. Today there's more infrastructure growth then we ever expected this soon. And bitcoin price is not such an issue when unlike stock shares, you don't have to purchase a whole bitcoin. So if you lose 85% of $X that you decided to invest, it's the exact same amount REGARDLESS of bitcoin price!  
Now we get to worry less about price and more about watching to see where this all leads. The potential applications of the Bitcoin blockchain are plentiful to say the least.

Anywhere below 6k could potentially reward you in a few years but you have to think long term, and you should NEVER invest more than you can afford to lose. The main reason there are so many trolls and non-invested people in a bitcoin sub is because they are teenagers and kids who still have not matured and enjoy schoolyard insults. BUT ... they do it because they think all crypto investors put way more money than they could afford to lose in the market and now their lives have collapsed. This is simply not true at all, but I would still offer you the above advice - don't feed the stereotype :).
@_date: 2018-11-28 01:16:33
Who said anything about holding coins? Who said anything about any of that rambling crap you just posted? Get over yourself and use your brain. Bitcoin, bitcoin Sv, whatever the hell ends up breaking the barrier, this thing is not going to go away because of some speculated price. Bitcoin technology offers the potential of a multipurpose global accounting system that maintains itself via the math, and remains decentralized. It can be a push payment system, and a store of value for a future society (assuming the volatility has dissipated) that will likey embrace such a digital ledger. Transferring wealth over seas to anyone, anywhere, without the need for an expensive middleman to intervene. 
What about the possibilities of potential we have not even dreamed up yet? Nobody envisioned the internet to deliever the way it does today. It's extremely difficult to envision innovation that has not yet been created. But there's no need to be so stubborn that your mind stays closed and complacent.
@_date: 2018-11-21 00:20:48
No a bubble is an inflated rate which can occur for many reasons. Take the real estate bubbles ...real estate still hold value after the bubble deflates. The problem with bitcoin is that a snowball effect resulted from people jumping on the bandwagon in hopes to grab a profit. Blaming this on Bitcoin is senseless. Bubbles are always a result of human greed and the deflating or bursting does not always reflect an issue with what was overpriced. For example, it is pure ignorance to compare tulips to the innovation of the bitcoin network which has multiple potential applications, many of which are unrealized. Nobody foresaw the application for which we use the internet today back in 1970 for example.

First of all, the fact that you care whether or not others appologize and you crave that validation suggests you may not be right very often. Second of all, have any of the trolls over past years ever apologized for claiming bitcoin was dead all those times? Nothing against you, people just rarely apologize for being wrong about bitcoin. That's been everyone at some point lol.
@_date: 2018-11-29 01:16:00
You realize you don't open a short for 10 months right? Shorting makes profits from tight time frames and whether the price is on a long term up or down trend is not relevant. You have the exact same opportunity to win or lose on a short regardless of the long term price trend.
@_date: 2018-11-26 15:21:39

That perspective is getting old and tired,  and is also naive. It's fine to speculate the price is lower but as a technology it most certainly does have fundamentals. The very least you guys could do is stop regurgitating the same ol argument.
To say Bitcoin has no fundamentals is an insult to the brilliant coders who have contributed thousands of hours.
@_date: 2018-11-26 04:41:31
The process is easy, making money on it is not always as easy as it appears from looking at a chart for price movement that has already occurred. You wouldn't be the first to assume that though so go find out for yourself. Google it, or check out BitMEX.
@_date: 2018-11-23 16:50:52
Some good points but the dot com bubble left us with the internet and the foundational organizations that run on it. So what took 5 years back then now takes about 1 year because the internet has fast tracked progress. That's why bitcoin only took 9 years to hit last year's high point and the internet took 25 years to reach the dot com bubble.
@_date: 2018-11-20 18:30:11

Again, network value. Ask any company what value they would place on an extremely robust, secure, redundant network that has never been hacked, run with 99% uptime for 10 years and still being improved upon as we are nowhere near where it will be. You can't fill a bathtub with it, but considering it's available to a global audience and busting with potential applications, now is when you invest. Not when the full potential has been realized. That's what high risk investing is all about. So don't try and tell others how to invest their money if you don't comprehend why this risk is an attractive one.

Problem is, complete decentralization means everyone is responsible for their wallets and private keys...in a world where the vast majority of people are still not technically confident enough to embrace that responsibility. Hell, there are still loads of people that struggle with organizing their email and the files on their PCs. 
So if you want mainstream ownership of crypto, you can either wait a few generations or be thankful for platforms that will allow people to buy bitcoin with a buy button in a familiar type of interface from a company they trust with their investment, so they won't have to worry about wallet addresses and storage responsibilities.
Then, just maybe, once people gain confidence in bitcoin, more people get on board, more get educated, more intuitive self-storage options open up and newer tech savvy generations enter the scene,  more and more people will start feeling confident with being responsible for their own bitcoin and crypto.
@_date: 2018-11-21 02:07:20

Of course it's not. Bitcoin could go to $1000 and still be just fine as it continues to thrive as developers continue to improve and build it's position for the future. The very fact that there's an entire crypto market and that we're even here talking about it is evidence of how far it's already come in only a decade. Imagine in another 10 years. Anyone can take a step back and see this. The crypto market is alive and well and if you call time of death every time bitcoin price rises and falls you'll be doing that years and years to come.

 "You need to invest with two attitudes: that you're going to hold it for years, even decades and that volatility is an inherent element of the asset"
\~ Ric Edelman, founder and executive chairman of Edelman Financial Services
That may sound like Captain Obvious, but it really is the most logical statement to sum up investing (NOT trading or shorting) in the crypto space. The mindless statements often made in this sub by those who wish to make you question your stance are background noise. As always, invest what you are prepared to lose, so you are in this with the perspective that it is a risk.  If you've stayed on the sidelines, now may the best time to get in because like all investments, you should buy when most people are over-cautious and the price is at a yearly low, because that's when it's usually the best entry point. Above ALL else: **DYOR** because most people post information that support their own perspective and agenda.
@_date: 2018-11-28 00:44:57
Ok good for you, but a lucky guess makes you any smarter than some of the successful businessmen that to this day feel it has a strong potential of success?
I don't have any better of a crystal ball than you do, but your head is so wrapped up in the speculative market that you completely dismissed that people buying and selling in cycles on what has become an increasingly popular trading market does not make bitcoin a shitcoin. The term shit coin was created to refer to the hundreds of alt coins created ONLY to try and emulate bitcoin's success. They never made it past the whitepaper! So consider that bitcoin's price is a result of whatever people are willing to pay for it.... but it's the exact same technology regardless of market noise. 
The dev community will contiue to improve it and it may or may not evolve into a mainstream currency. But make no mistake the speculated price tag has shown beyond any doubt that the market price has NOTHING to do with the technology. 
Do you think Bitcoin improved anything last November to justify 20k? Did it have a major tech failure to justify a 90% price drop? No to both! So my point is simple - price does not reflect the potential of the technology. It reflects speculation. To say bitcoin will be 100k by Dec was pure speculation and borderline insane, and to say it will go to 0 is equally as ludicrous.
@_date: 2018-11-29 00:36:56


You mean because he was  arguably the greatest Formula One drivers of all time and Bitcoin can be the greatest currency of all time? YES! I agree man! Wow, and you were acting so stupid in your last 100 posts.

@_date: 2018-11-19 21:21:19
Well then they probably won't until it is deemed safer. But an ETF for anyone with an appetite for risk is just fine. There are MULTIPLE factors contributing to the current price drop and yes, the Bcash mess is a huge part of this, but overall this too shall pass.
@_date: 2018-11-28 03:44:31


I don't think anyone said they expect that "anytime soon". How is it possible that anyone still attached to reality could think Bitcoin has failed because it can't displace a currency in 10 years? Think about that. This is not upgrading to the next version of the iPad. This is displacing the current shape of currency. It HAS to take generations.  The past ten years may be a small portion of a very long growth chart one day. Judging the future on such a small portion of early growth is futile.
@_date: 2018-11-20 17:48:39
Then you should not be wasting your time in here. I just threw my weekly payment into my stocks and I assure you there's plenty of controversy on that front too. Ten years is a drop in the bucket and I'm sure you've lived long enough to realize that. I'm not saying Bitcoin or anything is going to do anything for sure, but tech is rarely ever predicted to become what it does. You can preach all day that BTC will never be more than what it is ... you can't possibly know this and there's no debating that.
@_date: 2018-11-19 21:24:22

You are so ignorant. Ignorant regarding bitcoin, and even more ignorant to post in a bitcoin sub as though you have some special insight that the rest of the posters in here lack. I'm guessing you wouldn't be able to provide a basic explanation of what bitcoin even is. Well I suppose you can Google and copy/paste but most of you people who enjoy bashing bitcoin have very little insight on what you're even taking about. It was bad 4 or 5 years ago when the price dropped and the oh so sad people gathered some sort of self validation by telling us all that bitcoin was a 'fad'. A 'fad' they said! Oh now it's been 10 years and there is no definition of a fad that exceeds weeks or months. So you want to call Bitcoin bullshit hey? Do you feel better? Because I tell you what sir, in another 5 years you can come back and tell us again. You guys are hilarious!
@_date: 2018-11-29 17:46:03

No, but many like to relate their recent earnings report to crypto mining because it makes a good scapegoat. I've invested in chipmakers and have been following AI and machine learning stocks to stay in the know. All tech stocks took a beating past few months. Nvidia fell short of their estimates and their stock shares reflect that gap, simple as that.
@_date: 2018-11-25 18:57:59
It's a risky move, but as long as you're able to stomach the loss if it doesn't work out it is one that could provide incredible returns. Put it this way, bitcoin is going to continue to be developed and improved for years to come, even the ignorant trolls can't argue with that. Also, buying bitcoin is less of a risk now than it was when the hype was at full capacity and bitcoin was trading for almost 20k. That's the very worst time to buy it. Obviously there's no guarantee, but if you're want to make a risky investment in bitcoin, now is a better time to  make it.
@_date: 2018-11-09 00:00:56
Where is the contradiction? I never said I predicted anything. Also you know full well that I mean no rules to dictate the path that Bitcoin will follow because wildcards are plentiful. I find most of the stock market tactics simply do not apply to bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-11-25 21:53:14
No, it never has. It's simply the crypto market doing what the crypto market does.

Price drama is noise.

That's not what it's based on but do you see this as an issue? Your computing device is identified by it's name/IP and so is your home on your street by its address. It's more about math that ensures a working system.

@_date: 2018-11-20 00:32:25

I don't think bitcoin or this sub is for you sir. I wonder why you are are here, but truly I don't really care. Nor I am sure do you care why I am here. But your understanding of Bitcoin is completely wrong. Many atheists take the time to learn about several religions because they enjoy the conversations. you are currently not equipped to have a conversation about bitcoin, yet you are here trying to contribute to the discussion. You don't see how strange that might seem to me?
@_date: 2018-11-19 02:01:35
Not really.  The money from the 'first' purchasers of the stock can be used by the company throughout various initiatives yes, but after that the money generally goes to the previous owner of the stock, and that is usually not the company. 
In any case, investing in future potential takes balls, information and belief that you have realization of the potential. If you have neither of these just don't invest, it's simple. But for fuck sakes, don't be telling other risk takers how to invest, that's just being a pompous dick... that was my point. You don't go hang out in Vegas trying to convince the players to get the fuck out do you?
@_date: 2018-11-20 16:04:36

Well if you feel that way, you should just accept that you are not a candidate to invest in network value (because you clearly can't seem to relate to it) and walk away. It's not for everyone, no big deal right? I mean if you read back on the early articles criticizing the internet, many people just couldn't grasp the network value and sounded an awful lot like you. The potential is in the things we have NOT considered, not in what we already know... that's been milked already. I place bitcoin above my stocks and real estate, that's how confident I am. If I lose that's on me, nobody else.  You do you, and let everyone else do same.

Anyone who thought it would be used on any serious level this soon are as premature as those calling for Bitcoin to hit 100k by year end or those who believe it's going to drop to 1k and go away.

It's about having an option of a global decentralized currency that is sheltered from the corruption of any one controlling entity. Functioning as a currency may have been the original concept, but as we know from history, sometimes the most disruptive technologies used by society began as a solution or tool for a completely different use case than it became adopted for. 
Even if Bitcoin ever replaced FIAT, that would take many many years. But to function as an alternative currency, exceptional store of value that could easily return gains for years to come, high speed transfer of large amounts of money overseas and a bridge to cross currencies, and multiple uses not even thought of yet... Bitcoin has incredible potential for a growing digital society. 
It has the network value of computing power and can become the most accurate accounting tool to record wealth and transactions on a global level. It's potential to function as a hedge alone has barely even been recognized compared to how it will be utilized in years to come. This is just the beginning.

You could say that about any innovation before it matured. That's just stating the obvious and is irrelevant.

It's a culling. A culling of shitcoins, hype and over inflated prices. Bitcoin can take the hit, the other bullshit can't. In the end, bitcoin gets to continue thriving in a cleaner space until such time where once again the only blockchain that matters will need to seperate the wheat from the chaff.

The surface has barely been scratched. 
@_date: 2018-11-19 12:01:13
Well of it hits zero and erases the past 10 years of gains and infrastructure growth then I guess we'll all take our toys and go home lol. Personally I think it will continue growth right on track with the cyclical highs and lows along the way.

I do not only comment when it drops. I have said the same thing since my buddies who mine BTC got me into it many years ago. The exact same thing. My perspective has not changed, other than I have never been more confident in BTC than I am currently.
@_date: 2018-11-06 00:39:52
OP doesn't understand that the ONLY way for even a very small fraction of potential investors/owners/users of bitcoin to own any would be if the price goes far beyond the last ath. The OP has a basic grasp of regurgitating dot com historical info, but has no concept of basic math. 
He was correct about the hype phase, as was pretty much everyone who ever heard of the hype cycle, but recovery DOES NOT 'have' to take 3 to 6 years. There is no fixed time frame. It could be sparked by a major event, a breakthrough in the tech, or a huge stamp of approval from a large  Influencer.  In short - nobody knows the future.
@_date: 2018-11-21 00:46:04
What's my side? You really are a little child aren't you? Which would explain why you have the free time to hang out on reddit pretending to have investment insight but no investment.
@_date: 2018-11-20 13:26:14
Sure for all we know, it could go to 0 or 10k, it's always been this way since the fist day I heard of bitcoin. What exactly is your point? If you're bothered by this then you may have invested more than you can afford to lose. This is not a retirement plan it's just high risk stakes on what you believe the future holds. I've had loads if fun with 5% of my investments in this space for years!
@_date: 2018-11-20 19:03:54
It's a solid date. That's actually really good news.
@_date: 2018-11-22 19:07:25
Then stop expecting too much too soon. The only tech that evolves that fast would be tech that simply offers a 2.0 to something already implemented. This is currency we're talking about. Something that will take multiple generations at the very least to see fully realized. 
Also, people losing money by risking it on the potential outcome of this technology should realize that it needs to take time. They should also allocate no more than 5% of their investment money towards anything that they would need to cash out this soon. Long term investment means you haven't lost anything until you need to cash out. And tell me, why would anyone expect to cash out of such an incredibly new tech investment so soon? Outside of the big run up last year, the entire picture shows all of this very clearly.

@_date: 2018-11-25 22:14:33
Yes and that's why price drama is just noise. Depending on your age you may remember when sending an early email required basic coding and functioning in a text based OS. Nobody was going to mass adopt that! My point is that we can only guess how bitcoin will be shaped in another 10 years, but it would be logical to assume that after coming this far, the development is not just going to mysteriously halt.
@_date: 2018-11-26 12:26:40
Ha ha I was just reading down through the comments and you've said this same thing multiple times within the hour. You seem pretty involved for someone who thinks it's dumb money lol.
@_date: 2018-11-20 00:53:14
So how many of you bought BTC sub $500? How do you feel about the cry babies on here saying it's dead while you're up 10X? And if it was dead then how many mining machines have been turned off today? Any? Because the guys I know mining don't seem phased by this at all. They're disgusted by the Bcash crap but they don't seem in the least bit worried about moving forward.
@_date: 2018-11-18 22:01:44
Usually they bought at 14000? But it was only in that range for a tiny period of time.
@_date: 2018-11-16 14:38:40
@_date: 2018-11-23 15:01:18
I was just reading down through the comments and saw this. Was that a typo? Above 4300? It's over that price now and has recovered from far worse devastation over the years. This recent decline is simply a pull back to reality after the hype of last year catapulted the price into levels that could not be sustained with the current technical knowledge level of the average investor. It's getting much easier to buy bitcoin, and the technical level of entry required is lowering. Add to that an entire new generation of tech savvy investors about to come online. The only one who is delusional is he who can't see what is coming through the fog of what currently is right now.
@_date: 2018-11-19 17:54:37
Could still say the same! Nobody knows! Stocks are getting crushed today too .. averaging down ...It's worked for me for many years.
@_date: 2018-11-21 01:58:38
Oh I see. Thanks for educating me. I better sell now :). Look Instead of debating it, how about we just give it a few years and if you're wrong you can revise your perspective then.
@_date: 2018-11-26 15:39:45
They must be pretty amateur if they think posts in this sub have any impact on price. Price moves of $100+ in 5 minutes are not people in this sub buying or selling ha ha.

Again, it's a full-fledged, fully functional market now. Whatever ever the price of the coins or tokens, the market is growing, the infrastructure is growing, apps are being launched daily, ETF's, BAKKT, Futures etc. 
There's no stopping this now whether you chose to participate or not!
I never assumed you were a paid troll lol. But you seem desperate to convince that bitcoin is dead which is insane based on the growth. I've been messing around with this for years and my close friends have beein mining since the start (I love them but hate them too haha). You don't have to believe me, but get that silly price prediction nonsense out of your head and play the moves, up OR down. Or just hold and check back occasionally. If you had a lucky guess you NEED to accept that it was just luck. Everyone threw a guess in the hat and some were lucky. Bitcoin moves are determined by many variables and you need to first know what you 'don't' know. Nobody can predict Bitcoin, but take a guess and you might be right!!
@_date: 2018-11-11 13:59:33

This line from the article below sums up why I have felt it's foolish not to at least have 'some' money in crypto:
"If you have something that can potentially 50x, you must have 98% conviction that it’s not going to happen for you to not put money in."
@_date: 2018-11-24 18:37:32
That's what you said at 6300 too. You also said this on 3 of your your other Reddit user accounts last week, 2 yesterday, and ....
@_date: 2018-11-18 19:01:22
Well if out of 10 years of incredible growth, they only focus on the one last year because of the investment side of things being in a bear market, then you can assume they are likely uninformed or a shill lol.
@_date: 2018-11-19 17:09:43

@_date: 2018-11-24 04:06:29
You continue to stay far away?? The longest reddit post I've seen to date in a bitcoin sub is your idea of staying far away from bitcoin? I'd hate to see what an obsessive mess you'd be in if you were continuing to stay close.
@_date: 2018-11-19 14:27:46
Don't buy all in now, average down guys. I know a lot of people who bought all in during early 2014 and I was close to all in, only to drop deeper and wait for what felt like ages to recover. I know there's a lot more infrastructure these days, but I strongly suggest averaging down in case it drops a little lower.  This Bcash game and the panic selling will level off and rise back but you want to catch every opportunity!
@_date: 2018-11-21 21:00:57
Wow you must feel so validated and so much more of a man now that you just got that off your chest. All bitcoin investors must surely be unproductive and penniless because you said so.

At least he maintains his multiple Reddit accounts. Sad though.
@_date: 2018-11-29 17:54:30
Of course! After years of hearing both sides of the equation on Bitcoin, I can say with confidence that the average person who supports bitcoin (not the person who FOMO'd in for a few days last year), is of a higher intellect than the average person who does not. Most people who criticize Bitcoin have very little technical knowledge, and are not technically confident. They tend to say it has no intrinsic value because their perspective of finances is traditional and complacent. They are NOT open to change, and that's a mistake in today's world. The average person who is pro bitcoin seems far more in tune with the value of this new digital way of storing and exchanging value, because they take the time to learn about its potential before regurgitating the 'tulips' insults.
Now before anyone starts accusing me of stereotyping without justification, I repeat .."most" people. It's clear in the typical arguments we hear against Bitcoin that "most" people make, that they haven't really taken a lot of time to explore its potential.
@_date: 2018-11-23 15:53:39
I rest my case. You have zero insight and nothing to offer. Run along now.
@_date: 2018-11-01 02:13:11
Those replies were not hateful because you predicted a bear market. It's bear or bull - a drunk monkey can have a 50% chance of being right. The comments were made because you're full of shit.
@_date: 2018-11-18 02:11:04
Bears make a lot of stupid points, and hey so do bulls. But the dumbest thing I hear on this sub is that people are afraid to invest after the big spike and drop over this past year. That showed everyone what Bitcoin is capable of, without even being close to matured. People who buy Bitcoin are risk takers no doubt. Just like high risk stocks investors, gamblers, etc - people who love the rush of it. People who love the chance that the pay off will outweigh the risk.  There will NEVER be a shortage of people who want this, and now that we've seen that a small investment can go 10X and more in a short time, the risk takers will jump back in, make no mistake. That's what risk takers live for. Basically, stop saying stupid shit 'cough ..neveragain..cough...moron..cough. 
@_date: 2018-11-12 21:55:21
...if we're looking up at it. Lol
@_date: 2018-11-15 18:14:47
If you're not in invested in Bitcoin for the long game you better be a damn good trader. Either that or your only investment is to jump on Reddit and act like a blowhard know it all and tell everyone how stupid they are because you refuse to consider where this is all headed. Crypto is not going away, and some years will be bear and some bull. 
Accumulate if you believe that the growing infrastructure and integration will lead to a future where your investment pays off, trade, or walk away. Stressing out over current prices is not healthy and listening to people on here saying bitcoin is dead or bitcoin is going to 100k next month is not healthy either. Bitcoin has been following this familiar pattern for years, so if your accumulating for future potential, a bitcoin is a bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-11-21 23:13:57
That's because the absolute bottom of the barrel comes out to tell everybody how stupid they are for putting money into bicoin when the price is down. It makes them feel smart and they take that with them down the troll hole when the price is going up.
@_date: 2018-11-21 16:03:12
They can't mind their own business because they need a sense of validation to feel some kind of self-worth. Talking down to people who put money in bitcoin makes them feel smart lol. It's pathetic and I agree 100%.
@_date: 2018-11-21 21:03:56
Great, you just commented for the sole purpose of insulting a young bitcoin investor. Great use of your time. You must be proud.
@_date: 2018-11-25 18:38:39
That's why a culling of spinoffs, hype and over inflated prices is necessary every once in a while. This price drop doesn't even phase bitcoin's growth and development, it just cleans up the space. Bitcoin is the only reason blockchain is even talked about. Bitcoin can take the price hit and still be up over 100x what it was not so long ago, but the crap coins will be eradicated.
@_date: 2018-11-20 15:00:16
Sure it happened. They were saying last night that they noticed regular interval sells of up to 400BTC at a time from the same entity. If their pride and greed is that messed up, I say good riddance because in the long term they'll have done this space a favor. No one entity should have that much influence anyway.

It's worth what speculators are willing to pay for it, and you can expect that price to fluctuate wildly for years to come until either:
A. Bitcoin becomes a global ledger where wealth and transactions are maintained on a digital ledger that has the potential to advance into the single most efficient accounting system the world will have ever seen.
B. Something will go terribly wrong and the technology will fail.
Until that time expect the speculation circus to contunue..
@_date: 2018-11-28 00:18:37
"The technology didn't exist" ...wow you don't see how you just supported my perspective right? I was configuring enterprise networks when you were probably still learning to walk. I'm well aware of what tech existed and how it was improved over time with TCP, protocols, layers, DNS etc. Once bitcoin is brought to similar levels of improvement it will probably explode too. Or not! We'll just have to wait and see. But I will tell you that it's impossible to disrupt something as embedded in society as money in 10 years. It takes generations. Once the next generations of tech savvy kids become investors bitcoin may align very well with their lifestyles.
@_date: 2018-11-20 17:53:33
No . I've been averaging down of course!! Buying the shit out of it if you will haha. (within my 5% of total investment rule of course)
@_date: 2018-11-19 18:44:55
I fully understand how stock value and corporate value works, but thanks I realize you were trying to be helpful. Bitcoin is valued on its future potential and it is also extremely cyclical. Price outgrows infrastructure, then price pulls back and infrastructure outgrows price ...rinse and repeat. It's much like the internet, and that's based on my years in this space and my years of gains and losses on internet companies years ago. 
Basically, everyone thinks that as soon as people start buying Bitcoin more the price will soar but it's alot that happens before the prior to make this possible. Once revenue is generated using the Bitcoin network, just like it us using the internet, then value exists. Since there was no 'internet token' back in the day, we are all new to the process of valuing Bitcoin. Make no mistake though, regardless of what happens with the current price ..bitcoin is here to stay and that price will increase drastically over coming years.
@_date: 2018-11-29 15:56:30

Maybe crypto folks have multiple other investments and Bitcoin is one of many things they wanted to experiment with. If you really want to save some souls, go to Vegas and preach to all the gamblers about how they should spend their money. Open a shelter for homeless! How about starting a crypto hotline call-in show! :)
It's fascinating that so many people show up to preach to others on how they should spend their money. Almost as though they have nothing else to do with their time. If the feeling of being 'holier than thou' is really that important to you, than perhaps you should start by addressing your own issues.
@_date: 2018-11-16 01:38:43
It sailed to 20k (approx) last year for a joke. And that was before all the improved access to purchase that we see now, and with only a very tiny fraction of potential participants. I believe it will very easily surpass 20k in time. Once you have experienced the bull run of a global market you realize the sheer limitless possibilities.
@_date: 2018-11-23 15:22:04
Of course not. Although Bitcoin has made some impressive progress in the past 10 years compared to many other technologies that failed. My point, if you had taken the time to process what I wrote, as that many people evaluate future potential only on current state of a technology. This has been a big mistake multiple times throughout history, and it could very well end up being a mistake with some people's complacent stance on technologies like bitcoin. This whole market price thing has led people away from the fact that Bitcoin is an exceptionally secure and stable netork that maintains itself via perfect math. Maybe you don't see the value in that for potential future applications, but I believe it holds much value. We shall see over the next decade or so. Perhaps I am wrong, but at least open your mind.
@_date: 2018-11-19 20:22:41
Look at all the activity going on in here. So it takes a little drama in the price to create a little drama in the discussions I suppose. This too will pass jut like all the years before. Buy..sell..do whatever floats your boat, but BTC don't give a fawk about us and it isn't going away.
@_date: 2018-11-03 02:57:07
Ha ha ha... 'analysis'. Ha ha ha ha ha ha. 
First off, the 'analysis' is why the hell would anyone with no skin in the game be posting in here regularly?! You're telling me that your buddy/alt there has nothing else to do but come to a focus group to tell everyone how stupid they are? Give me a break.
@_date: 2018-11-18 20:46:48
Well that's common sense, because the price keeps creating higher all time highs. Just as many of us have been saying for years now, it's all a logical part of an expanding network (still in brutally early stages) that will exponentially increase in waves.
@_date: 2018-11-19 23:34:40
Sure man ...sure.
@_date: 2018-11-20 19:27:50
Only if the node hash power, network stability and security, etc are surpassed.  But let's be real ...Bitcoin is so far ahead of any other crypto project right now, it will take long time to be dethroned. and even if that happened, and that's a BIG if, there will still be plenty of coins/tokens on the crypto market.
@_date: 2018-11-20 21:42:35
I've lost some of my gains form pre last December but I'm more than confident they'll return. This is not the first rise and drop in BTC price you realize that right? It's been ten years, I've been here for half that and I know many that have been here since the start as miners. I hate listening to blowhards who constantly use insults to make a point. It's almost as though you all want some sort of validation, or get some personal satisfaction from "I told you so's" as though it matters in the big picture.
I mean let's be honest - if you truly are not invested, why are you wasting your time in here to 'warn' risk takers that they are taking a risk. Do you realize how crazy that is? Why don't you go down town and find some drug users and preach to them about the risks? Because that's not anonymous and you can't just jump on some thread and belittle others for your own personal sick satisfaction? Why not jump in a Reddit sub for cave divers and tell them they may lose their lives and that they are wasting their money and time on a rush that you don't feel is worth it??
My point ..we're all responsible for our own level of risk exposure and many like myself have solid investments outside the crypto market but very much enjoy playing around in here with 5% that I am OK with losing. I've felt some great rushes watching my $$ multiply many times and I've felt disappointment watching it fall. This is not the first year for Bitcoin like may of you seem to imply. Next year? We'll see and that's the fun of it!! You on the other hand, have no skin in the game and are just in here to tell us how bad our decisions are? Please. 
@_date: 2018-02-15 18:53:46
yeah, a little of all the above. The hearings definitely boosted the positive vibe though, no question. That kind of approval helps to write off the fears based on regulation. 
Overall though, yes it's a mixed bag. It's also momentum, because it snowballs in one direction or another and there are catalyst such as the senate hearings that provide the initial push.
@_date: 2018-11-26 19:38:34
Like I just said below, no matter how crappy things get with crypto prices, it could always be worse - you could be a troll LOL. They are the pathetic cancerous bottom feeders of any successful forum. You know bitcoin has found a bottom when there's an increase in bottom feeders posting!
@_date: 2018-11-19 12:09:07
Do what makes you feel least stressed out. Bitcoin has been growing for ten years, I just keep buying. I've been down on what I bought in the past year but I could care less about that, it moves in cycles and has for years. Nobody ever sees the next move coming so eventually you usually end up in the green after each bear market. 
@_date: 2018-11-30 20:08:22
Then perhaps the issue here is that you're stereotyping all bitcoin investors based on that experience. Many of us don't over-invest. Many of us are prepared to lose on this "small portion of our total investment money" risk. Many of us know what we got into, and if there's not this huge risk involved perhaps would have used that risk money elsewhere, but still in just as equally of a risk manner. You should not assume that everyone invested in bitcoin deserves to be spoken down to as though you are above them. Nobody will ever listen to that, nor should they.
@_date: 2018-11-19 14:40:20
On the bright side, investors in BAKKT and the ETPs etc, are going to love this price opportunity. There are a lot of deep pockets out there who salivate at these types of opportunities while the little trolls on here with their half a bitcoin call it dead lololol.

I was up a lot, but then the past 12 months cut into my gains. I'm not doing bad but I did average down with new $$ since February, so that portion is a bust. Bottom line it's approx 5% of my investment dollars, so my stocks and real estate are doing great lol.

Then don't if it's not for you, that's understandable. I'm sure you're not alone on that opinion. I invest in stocks and real estate first, Bitcoin is a risk I am 100% willing to take. I've worked in IT my whole life and I really see Bitcoin going somewhere as a new way to invest and store value. Who knows! If the tech experiences some sort of catastrophic failure (which I seriously doubt), then I'll take the loss and move on. If not, I believe this is only going to continue to get bigger in the years to come.
@_date: 2018-11-29 00:11:52
Realistically it will take longer. You can't displace currency without it taking generations. Children use money to learn how to count, and I can't imagine children counting in Satoshi's any time soon lol.

If you have thousands of miners get on board, with millions of $$ of computing equipment around the entire globe to reinforce, stabilize and secure your network, a growing community of brilliant developers contributing to the  code, improving it ongoing, with layers and protocols and side chains etc. Now if you just get 10 years in to build the foundation and confidence that it will run with 99.999% up time like Bitcoin then YEAH!! You sure could buddy, You go!
@_date: 2018-11-28 02:23:04
You want to know why alt coins exit? BITCOIN.
Why do crypto exchanges exist? BITCOIN.
Why does the entire crypto market exist? BITCOIN.
Why is crypto mining a thing? BITCOIN.
Why is anyone even talking about blockchain? BITCOIN.
Why does this Reddit sub exist? BITCOIN.
Why are you even here right now? BITCOIN.
...and you stupid trolls honestly think this is all over? That this is just going to stop because the market price dropped? If you really think Bitcoin is dead, then the only bubble is the one you're living in. Bitcoin has only just begun.
@_date: 2018-11-26 15:53:57
In terms of market price sure, but who cares! There will always be people with an appetite for risk and with this unpredictable market, why wouldn't they wanna play the game? As infrastructure grows there are endless possibilities for catalysts that could change public sentiment on a dime and see another bull run...only to once again crash and repeat the same cycle all over. The market does what it does and trying to advise anyone how to spend their money is futile.
@_date: 2018-11-21 00:28:08
Well I don't know you, but I don't think there are many experts on here, unless you have a degree in human greed lol. The closest I've come personally to an expert is a miner buddy of mine and he'd be the first to tell you he only knows the basics ...after a decade!! Blockchain is way more complicated than many people think.
My point above is that I don't ever advise anyone on anything. I simply like to debate based on my experience in investing and network security. Anyone asks I say if you want to invest, minimize it to what you can afford to lose. The rest is just exchanging ideas on a platform.
@_date: 2018-11-22 19:53:29
That's a market perspective - and we can all agree that in markets, people like to buy when prices are down, particularly if they've seen them reach the spectacular highs of this scenario. Well unless for example a company went bust or something, but we all know bitcoin is not going anywhere.
@_date: 2018-11-20 20:47:25
Well, no if you follow the markets, the penny stocks are equivalent to the alt coins that have no value because they have no network - I mean they literally have no computing power. Bitcoin has a network that has ran for 10 years with 99.999% up-time and not 1 single hack. It also has incredible accuracy backed by perfect math and impeccable redundancy on a global level. The equipment and network value could be worth as many millions as such stability in a network is worth to the user. Ask any company what such a computer network would be worth to them. 
Now these alt coins that disappear .. they have NO network. They are just a white paper. Thus, they compare to Penny stocks. make sense?
@_date: 2018-11-12 19:16:19
With Bitcoin, anything is possible with regard to price. Expect the unexpected.
@_date: 2018-11-19 19:51:36
I'm not sure what you mean, I've been trading and averaging down all the way. Of course I know the price lol! I meant that nobody knew before where it would be and nobody knows now where it will be ...period. Anyone can guess and be right, but I've been in this market a long time and I know it was no skill - just a guess.
@_date: 2018-11-20 01:08:34
Yes it does for sure. I'm just concerned that I'll be stubborn again and not sell the next top. I have had the year 2025 in my head for ages and I refused to sell until then. I may still resist selling the next top yet too lol.

I know you and I don't see eye to eye but here's a fact. There are desperate, sad, pathetic users in this sub who are each operating multiple accounts. They have been down-voting all positive comments such as yours and spamming the chat with negativity. They are accomplishing nothing, because there's nobody left to talk to. So if you think you are being down voted by popular opinion, it's just the same handful of pathetic no-life people using multiple accounts.

There are a lot of opinions, but I personally feel that the currency use thing is a long ways off and an investment as a store of value will almost certainly occur first. Bitcoin is currently worth a value that is based on the total amount of wealth that people choose to place within this new type of decentralized, digital container based on self-maintained accounting. Sure the potential of the tech is fantastic, but for now it's speculative, simple as that. Place your bet on the future and have fun. Don't invest more than you can afford to lose, yada yda ...the usual. Hey..I could be wrong but you have to bet on what you believe in after you DYOR.

So how much did you lose anyway? Surely you don't waste time regularly posting negative comments in a reddit group about something you think is worthless for no reason. Your life life can't be that boring!
So how did bitcoin hurt your feelings?
@_date: 2018-11-22 12:42:09
They used to complain that the internet was a waste of energy too. But as far as polluting the planet, there are many other concern that we need to address with pollution that push bitcoin  way down the list...despite the scare articles that were pushed out.
Several mining companies have been experimenting with recycling the energy and I recall reading about one that used the heat. We are barely getting off the ground with this technology so innovative ways to conserve and recycle energy will likely be a large part of the next ten years for bitcoin. There's also the possibility of computing power that requires less energy and more efficient ways of keeping the processor cool. Exciting times ahead!
@_date: 2018-11-21 01:31:37
Since I never promised it I can't tell you. Ive also never predicted price, I simply think that bitcoin has a great future. I can promise you is that if bitcoin hits 20k or 50k or whatever one day I'll be a much bigger man than you and NOT pretend you were wrong just because you didn't agree with me.
But hey you know what? You are in here right? Even though you don't really have any actual money in the kitty right? So you must not have a big lot going on in life. Tell you what, go ahead and lie like a motherfucker. Go ahead and pretend I promised instituional money as insane as that is. Because I'm gonna do what I've been doing anyway, and you'll gain some validation of self worth from your premature call on time of death for bitcoin.

"Fiat money is an intrinsically worthless object, such as paper money, that is deemed to be money by law".

Anyone that aquired Bitcoin for the first 9 years are not really worried about what the files contains. But what it represents in accounting for an amount of wealth...just like the file that represents your bank account. The same can be said for skilled traders and shorters for the past year. But if you are even slightly smarter than your question implies you are, you probably already knew that.
@_date: 2018-11-17 03:21:53
Nope, I've said years away, and have said that for as long as I have ever talked about bitcoin. I never predict prices, you got the wrong reddit name. It must be rough having to constantly criticize others to make up for your massive shortcomings. I don't care what you do with your crypto it's none of my business but leave me out of your posts please. This is getting pathetically redundant.

You need to learn what a 51% attack is. Ultimately it's hype news. It would also need to be executed by a mining outfit that requires immense resources and investment to build. So becoming that invested in something to destroy it would be irrational on a serious scale.

@_date: 2018-11-06 00:20:04
OK, so you're saying interest follows price, because once the whales took their profits, everyone panic sold, and the price tumbled back, everyone got scared away. 
When price pumped - people FOMO'd in, but when price dropped ..people left.
So, INTEREST FOLLOWS PRICE. Got it! Thanks man. interest follows price, interest follows price, interest follows price. GOT IT!!
@_date: 2018-11-26 04:22:35
Well I suppose it would be a funny world if everyone felt the same lol. I respectfully disagree..strongly disagree. But even after years as an IT professional, my knowledge of the Bitcoin blockchain barely scratches the surface. It's far more complex than most choose to acknowledge. 
As for your statements, I believe you should consider that Bitcoin has no marketing company to promote buzz, the bitcoin community throwing around technical jargon has no impact on price, and the FOMO experienced last year was retail based with people chasing the rising price in exponential numbers. That's a result of human greed and also a by product of markets. What I referred to with blockchain buzz and hype was a result of recalculated marketing to generate hype. There is a monumental difference.
Aside from all that, there are thousands of things to invest in! Why hang out in a bitcoin community Reddit sub if you feel the fundamentals are non-existent? You have to admit that's an odd choice when you could be investing in something with fundamentals you feel better about!

It was mainstream back in Mt. Gox too. And it was 100% BAD news mainstream!! I actually thought for a short time my money was gone and accepted it. If BTC survived that, this is a walk in the park.
@_date: 2018-11-27 00:16:04
I don't even know what they're thinking when they say bitcoin is dead. It's like they live under a rock .. well that's probably where they live actually. Do they even understand that the crypto market actually came after bitcoin and was birthed as a result of people wanting to obtain it? Bitcoin could care less what price it's at dirung any given time. It was never created only to be traded in a market, but either way, it's certainly not going away now after ten years.
@_date: 2018-11-30 03:59:51
It's not mainstream but it's on it's way. I don't know why you'd think I'm late in, its been a good few years. You just think it's mainstream to you, which I get. But no -  just hearing about it, which still represents a majority of the planet, is not the same as buying/trading it, using it or holding it. So yeah... mainstream network shows are actually great signals.
EDIT: It was a CATEGORY. That's called progress.
@_date: 2019-01-16 23:07:31
Diversification will always be important of course, so security tokens, stocks, real estate, etc. would be ideal. Tokens allow people to invest in something they could never otherwise afford.
Also, these exchanges would be the real deal and play by the rules and regulations. You could keep your tokens on these exchanges and likey be protected. This is not about the decentralized currency movement.

Once the price catches up with the infrastructure, it may be well above that in 2021 lol. People new to this space may fall for that bet because they look at current price and think "Oh no it's all gone". But the price pulls back, the infrastructure grows, the price catches up, rinse and repeat. If anyone takes your bet, at least explain to them how this works before they owe you 100k in few years. Oh wait ... they don't pay you? huh?

@_date: 2018-11-29 18:21:35
Why would they need to know about BitMEX to added a little money here and there over the years? By the exact same logic, in 7 years from now, the number of people who will have invested in, be considering investing in, or heard of Bitcoin will be equally as much larger than today, as today is than back in 2011. That's typically how technology integrates with society as it becomes improved, more user-friendly, and adopted over time. 10 years is but a drop in the bucket for something like a new concept of currency, which will inevitably take generations to fully implement.
@_date: 2018-11-18 14:38:34
You're obviously new and should go read up on the past decade of crypto before commenting and sounding like you live under a rock... or are simply an idiot. Every comment you make sounds like an old man shouting at bitcoin with zero information of the infrastructure growth taking place.

Many things have been compared this way, and there's many other examples. The point is simply that criticism and lack of knowledge of any tech during early stages is common.
@_date: 2019-01-12 04:59:46
No bitcoin is the only reason anyone even talks about blockchain. Blockchain is just a nice buzzword companies add to their profile to lift stock prices. There are some decent ideas in the works for blockchain use but not to replace bitcoin. Altavista was a search engine managing queries and data on the network. There will apps that come and go which manage bitcoin transactions too .. but bitcoin IS the network in this scenario. You don't seem to grasp this.
@_date: 2019-01-17 16:45:30
You mean why did I say it "may" be more likely? Because whenever we get organic growth of small staircase movement upward over time, there tends to be a single red candle of selloff that erases a week of gains in 20 minutes as some whale gobbles up all gains in one shot. But again, my point is largely that there is every bit as much reason to assume the price is being suppressed as it is to believe it is being inflated.
@_date: 2019-01-08 12:14:56
Nothing "has" to happen. If you've learned anything in the past decade you should have learned that. There's always someone who thinks they know the order of what has to happen and they're always wrong. Anyone who had bitcoin in Mt Gox days were hard core and will most likey hold on to it - considering they've seen several bubbles and the last one being 5X what's it's worth today. Unless they're in desperate need of the money, there's a good chance that they'll be waiting to sell much higher. 
@_date: 2018-11-30 15:19:53
Probably because he's doesn't seem smart enough to be taken seriously. He's obviously incredibly desperate to spread despair, but not wise enough to comprehend that posts in here can't possibly influence price.
That being said, since this is a sub for the bitcoin community to share and support one another I suspect his account will be banned due to all the mindless spamming he's doing. Sad fact is though, anyone that desperate will likely just create another account...assuming he's not already in here on multiple accounts already.

You're the one talking about bakkt, which hasn't even launched yet. I never said anything except that it was positive news, and that was ages ago. For some reason you've been bringing it up ever since. I'm doing what I've been doing for a very long time and if I lose all gains that's on me. Chatter on here is background noise, you should know that by now.
Oh and by the way, when the fuck did I ever price predict a price? I've been saying I'm OK with crypto maturing over several years and I've said it multiple times on here since day one. I'm fine with you or anyone else having different opinions than me but don't put words in mouth.
@_date: 2018-11-23 15:08:45
Bitcoin IS blockchain. PERIOD. If you don't realize this then you are not informed. All the efforts, all the node computing power, all the potential...lies within Bitcoin. All the altcoins, all the ICOs that failed, the entire crypto market.. is because of Bitcoin.
Remember back in the dot com days, when everyone would attach dot com to their business names to see their share price soar, only to crash and burn within the same year? Well that's EXACTLY what happened with blockchain. Businesses over this past year attached the buzzword blcokchain to their name and watched their share prices soar only to crash soon after. But Bitcoin ..like the internet ..is still here and the bitcoin blockchain grows stronger and stronger. Lightning network, side chains, growing dev community etc. I have no intention of being rude here, I simply want to correct you because you are after all, on a bitcoin Reddit sub. I'm sure there are many things I don't know, like all of us. But I can tell you this: Bitcoin is what will survive all of this, and all of us.

Well Microsoft was not always a huge company, but that's irrelevant because bitcoin is far more appropriately compared to the internet which also started out in a very small niche of users. It was slow, with not much use outside of networking whitepapers amongst a small group of military users. It was improved over 20 years or so with layers and protocols, and eventually adopted for individual use, but then criticized, called a massive waste of electricity and useless. Finally, it caught on. The biggest difference here is that bitcoin has been identified as a way to gamble via high risk investments and we've run with that use for now. 
I like many, am fine with that because it will help speed up  the transition to multiple other use cases over the coming years. I remember dial up internet well, and as smart as we all thought we were, very few were able to see where it was going. You are so far off base you are not even in the ball park.

Yes, I would say that a lot of people were expecting a breakout after that long period of sideways movement. Maybe that was the bottom until faketoshie and everything going on with bcash, or maybe it would have taken another step down anyways, there's really no way to know since the value is based on whatever anyone is willing to pay.
Bitcoin is creeping into more corners of life and will probably continue to grow for a long time to come. 
The value of Bitcoin will largely be a result of how much wealth people choose to hold in it. That 'could' over time, allow it to function as a currency and value store. Add to that the potential of the same system that stores the value having the technology to transfer it anywhere quick and cheap, and retain a single global equality - then you've got the beginnings of a successful Bitcoin. Either way, we're years away from that point. For now it's a market where people can line up to place their bets and hopefully, make themselves a little profit.

The dump was big and fast. This little lift we've seen over the last few days looks different in almost every way. The volume looks organic, the frequency looks organic, the purchase amounts look organic, and the slower burn looks organic. Now don't get me wrong, perhaps it's possible for this type of activity to be orchestrated by the right people, but it certainly does not look inverse in any way.

There was a war? Bitcoin isn't even old enough to shoot a gun yet. The banks have not been at war and it will be years before bitcoin becomes the global accounting ledger for financial transactions that it is destined to be. For now the speculation over price on a crypto market specifically made to speculate...does not mean shit.
@_date: 2019-01-26 12:51:46
You should start living in reality. Look around you at the difference in just the past 5 years. Exchanges, ATMs, developments like LN, sidechains, security tokens, proposed ETFs, bakkt, even Samsung is considering including a crypto wallet with the new Galaxy 10 Smartphone. If you deny this reality of the future for crypto, it is YOU who are living in a fantasy.

@_date: 2019-01-15 12:08:06
Doesn't work that way. The Bitcoin blockchain will be improved. The foundation is already there for ten years and the network it runs on will be organically updated as the nodes themselves are replaced with better computers over the years. This is happening whether you agree or not.

Why is it that crypto investors come in here and generally support each other consistently, while people like you just show up when the price is beat up to act like a horrible, toxic and jaded individual? What does that say about who is the better person?
@_date: 2018-11-22 12:32:00
Yeah you'd definitely be the guy who thought the car was a bad idea. And just like that guy, it's easy to act like you know when it requires generations to happen. At least your not important enough to be on the wrong side of history! Well, nor am I of course but just saying. To be honest I'm still not sure what stake you have in any of this, you definitely don't sound like someone who would put a dime in bitcoin!  I have 5% of my investments in crypto and I like idea of having it covered off on the event that it does take off one day as I think is very likely. In any case good luck with whatever you are invested in.

Wow, that's a lot dude. I'm not criticizing you, in fact I think bitcoin has an incredible future. But I also have a mortgage, real estate investments, and of course stocks and pension. So 5% is still a sizable portion and is what seems reasonable for a risk venture.
@_date: 2018-11-19 11:43:18
Same old song and dance. It's like people never ever learn, or have shit for a memory. It's almost unbelievable how much people say the exact same thing every time over and over like minions stuck in a loop.
Bitcoin hits ATH and everybody is whining "If I'd only bought more when it was so much lower. How did I not see this coming? I can't believe I didn't act on that"
Bitcoin drops and everybody is whining "Bitcoin is dead, nobody cares anymore. Why would I buy this crap?"
Ha ha if aliens were studying us from afar they'd be like "let's come back in another 500 years or so when their brains have evolved some more. They still learn nothing from past mistakes."
You don't make money investing at the high, you make money by investing when the price is beat up. Smart people buy and stupid people whine and complain. It's been that way for a very long time and certainly long before there was ever bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-11-23 21:04:35
OK, then don't invest in it. Anyone who invested in the past and lost 90% in 2015 were hit just as hard as anyone who invested in late 2017. The amount invested and the percentage lost is the same. The fact is you think that you and others are calling it a dead tech, a bubble, a shitty investment now are any different than those who said these EXACT same thing in 2014? Bitcoin was considered completely dead then, I mean just totally wrote off. Then it came back just as I believe it will do again. I bought it when it was beat up and everyone called it dead because it was dropping. I got it for 300 bucks and then again the next year it went even lower and I bought more. You don't buy when it's going great, you buy when it's beat up and not hyped. 
In any case, I understand the loss and the it is very frustrating because I've been there. I am there again now with anything I put in during the past year, so I am not being a hypocrite. I'm just tried of hearing people insulting everyone else on here, it's crazy.
@_date: 2018-11-28 01:39:32
Of course. I have been investing in stocks before bitcoin was ever a thing. I also own rental properties. You are being stubborn because you're dismissing where all this could be headed. You're not considering wallet address translation servers, which are most likely coming. You're judging future potential based on existing state. That's been a mistake more times in history than we can count. They used to say cars were not nearly as efficient as horses, because for the first 100 years...they weren't!! Trolls are bashing, not me. I'm saying not to be so quick to dismiss a future you can't possibly see.
@_date: 2018-11-20 17:56:12
The people that don't get this have very little skin in the game anyway. They just like to come on here and act like children. Since the 2008 stock mess and reality check I have not let much phase me. Crypto is a fun new market and I'm enjoying the hell out of it.

The best thing you can do is relax and not get sucked into the drama in this sub. As long as you never put more into the crypto market than you could afford to lose, all is well. The drama in here is highly exagerated. Bitcoin is not defined entirely by the volatility of the crypto market, it's the exact same thing as always. Markets take on a life of their own and prices don't always remain relative to what's being priced.
@_date: 2019-01-14 02:06:19
Ask yourself, if they never left before all the expanded infrastructure, do you honestly think they're going to leave now? Bitcoin has survived against incredible odds over this past decade. Nothing short of an apocalypse will kill it at this point.
@_date: 2018-11-27 22:54:04
A hell of a lot longer than ten years. This is money were talking about, not adding a higher speed connection port or QLED screen to existing tech. It took the internet about 30 years from the 60s to the 90s just to make it into the first few homes as a slow dial up service after it was criticized and ridiculed as being useless for years. Even with today's fast pace, it will take generations for bitcoin to become the global accounting ledger of worldwide financial transactions. But one thing you can absolutely count on - bitcoin development will not slow down. Think about the exchanges, apps, proposed etfs, bakkt, lighting network, sidechains, YouTube channels, advancement in mining tech, etc. And this is just the beginning.
@_date: 2019-01-11 20:30:10
People used to think that email was stupid and would never catch on. They also used to think that cars were for rich bored people because horses could go more places in the early days due to not enough roads and infrastructure to support cars. All in due time my friend. In the mean time, there's nothing wrong with educating people one at a time :).
@_date: 2018-11-26 01:51:51
Of course blockchain is the underlying tech, but for a large part of the past year many companies were falsely associating themselves with blockchain to boost their share prices, even though they did not necessarily implement blockchain into their business model. They also used the the 'buzz word' to inflate their social media engagement and generate hype. This is very much like what companies did when they associated themselves with dot com in the 90s to inflate their share prices only to go bust. There were also countless ICO's associating themselves with blockchain to sell their tokens, even though they did not even have a working blockchain at all! So no, to say it has become a buzz word to generate hype is not hypocritical nor is it a false claim. The bitcoin network however, like the internet, has survived all the buzz and all the hype and seems likely to thrive into the years ahead.
Also, coders such as Jimmy Song are very vocal about their opinion that Bitcoin and currency use is the very best implementation of blockchain, and the only reason blockchain is talked about.

Well I talk about it every day as part of my work. Tablets, phones, etc are not the same. They just taking an existing tech and expanding on it. The internet took about 30 years to catch on from the 60's to the 90's. I'm think Bitcoin can catch on ..not become a main currency or anything, but catch on, by the year 2025 at roughly half the time it took the internet. 
@_date: 2018-11-23 03:04:02
Interesting that your story excludes the first 9 years of bitcoin. Your explanation was fairly accurate, considering it was pre event, except for the saturation part. Most people by far were too intimidated by the required technical level of entry. So many people wanted to buy a little piece of the action but it was over their heads.
We may feel like it's second nature to grab a wallet address and configure cold storage etc, but the vast majorty of potential investors in crypto do not want to mess with such things. There are still loads of people who don't even know what bitcoin is other than they heard of it.
So no it was no where near saturated. User friendly onramps for crypto could easily increase the volume again. But if so, then it would still likely form another bubble scenario, I mean who doesn't love to cash out gains. Bitcoin also has begun the integration with digital money so who knows where it all will lead.
@_date: 2018-11-17 15:52:27

With this space, anything is possible. You just need to consider where I've been coming from on this. It's been many years and several close friends who got me into it were mining bitcoin on home PCs back in the day. I'm very much in reality I assure you :). Bitcoin does not have to replace fiat or the current system. 
Do I think that one day it may function as an alternative currency for a digital society? Yes, but first it needs to complete market saturation and then consolidate as a value store. That's where most of the guys deep into this see it headed first. Do I think it will be replaced? Hell no. It took ten years to just build  foundation to layer on. I've worked in the networking security field for years, and I can tell you - you don't replace networks, you upgrade them and replace the hardware. Bitcoin does not need anything else other than speed and upgrading. It doesn't need the fancy bells and whistles outlined on these crap whitepaper ICO's generated only to turn a profit. They barely have a functioning network yet! You can't believe that Lightning Network is the last update to Bitcoin do you? It's one of many many upgrades bitcoin will see over the next few decades. Devs are working this constantly and the Bitcoin dev team has grown much bigger over the past year.
@_date: 2019-01-22 16:46:39
There's been a lot of talk lately about Bitcoin dropping below 3k, and most of it has been in media and click bait articles. Of course nobody knows what is going to happen, just as nobody has known in the past - but it sure as hell seems like there's a setup in the works to liquidate a lot of short positions. Whenever there's been a lot of talk that convinces even the average small time investors like us that something is true, the opposite usually happens. Again, nobody knows, but caution is your friend.
@_date: 2019-01-29 05:42:59
People still use landlines, ride horses and eat what they kill too. Old and new will always coexist on some level. 50 years might be a bit exagerated but yeah of course it would have to take years.

Agreed. Price movement... within reason, doesn't bother me. I have been doing the same thing for years and that's buying a little bitcoin here and there. Accumulating as I go.  know that doesn't align with the currency use, but personally see Bitcoin making strides as an excellent value store before it succeeds fully as a widely adopted currency.

OK pessimists, so while you're all doom and gloom consider this. In 10 years the only time it has not been profitable to aquire bitcoin is if you aquired it in the past year. So 9 out of 10 years it was very profitable. 90% of the time Bitcoin has existed, it has given huge gains. Sounds like a pretty good investment to me.  And people wonder why miners are not worried about continuing to mine at current prices lol.
@_date: 2018-11-26 16:13:44

It will gain most traction as digital gold first. This has already begun and even in these very early stages, it's clear that after surviving these first 10 years despite massive odds, it's going to continue to thrive as a value store. One would have to be blind to not see this happening in front of them. Once enough people store a potion of wealth in bitcoin, it will easily function as a currency. It will take a while for this to mature but it's clear that bitcoin has aleady started to sync with society and the social collective.
@_date: 2019-01-10 23:26:51
There's not nearly enough user friendly platform infrastructure in place to see bitcoin being used to purchase goods yet, not for mass use. The average person spending bitcoin is coming but it has a good ways to go. 
I personally believe it will continue to grow as a store of value first and once enough people own it we'll see payment infrastructure grow. I think it's functionality as a new asset class and store of value is excellent for a new digital age and I like having it as a portion of my investments. I also know many others who have invested tens of thousands more than I who feel the same way.

Not really. Most modern day innovations were initially brainstormed to address a completely different issue than they were mass adopted for. Bitcoin may still displace FIAT in the future, but it's become an investment that currently holds worth based on network value. Perhaps the most robust, accurate and redundant global network to date. The remaining potential use of such a network is massive and will likely be unlocked as we progress into the future.

600 million in bitcoin was just sent internationally in minutes for 7 bucks in fees. Let that sink in, and if you don't know what that would usually cost or how long it usually takes ...prepare to be floored.

The comparisons to stocks are there, and I understand where you're coming from, but there are also many ways in which bitcoin and stocks are completely different. Bitcoin and crypto are about building the framework for a new kind of space. We've seen this in the past and should recognize the last 10 years as the making of something that is not going away. A bet on bitcoin is not like buying stocks.

First of all, that article was written with the agenda and bias of supporting Ripple XRP.  It's worth noting that we have much bigger contributing factors to global warming than bitcoin mining. 
Also consider the energy costs of using any other mechanism for keeping track of assets, for reconciling them, for ensuring that books are well-ordered, running a cash-based economy, printing money, handling cash, pulling banknotes out of circulation and printing new ones, etc. 
But to address your point there are potential solutions. One would be to recover the waste heat for heating homes and businesses. There are efforts to heat homes with exhaust from data centers for example.

That's your opinion. Keep that in mind and you'll be less disappointed when it doesn't play out the way you expect. Catalysts come in many shapes and sizes. Any single event could occur that could accelerate the price in either direction. This is a speculative market for now, on that you are correct. And speculative markets do not follow predictable trends. We all have our opinions but after years in this space there is one very clear fact I am positive on - if such a catalyst materializes, you WILL NOT see it coming.

No matter what time of day I check on here, the same 3 or 4 users are posting the same ridiculous negativity about bitcoin. I've never seen anyone so invested in something they think is a waste of time. 
They are literally the epitome of pathetic hypocrisy. But they do provide a few laughs like the clowns at children's bday parties. Well except the clowns actually get paid lol.

It could be at least one of the most impactful years anyway at least. Security tokens alone could open up an entire new space, where all tokens are purchased via bitcoin. Then there's bakkt, potential ETFs, new regulations, LN takeoff, etc.
@_date: 2019-01-15 23:52:21
Ahh, it must be nice to base your facts on your personal take from your taxi rides. That's solid research there buddy lol. Well, you go on and run with those 'facts' and don't buy any bitcoin and I'll just keep doing what I have for years, which is including it as part of my investment portfolio and we're both happy! Win win right? 
Everyone talks about the guys who lost money last year, yet nobody stops to understand that a 90% drop requires a LOT of selling. And I know quite a few people that made a LOT of money because they sold it for more than they bought it for. You think that's going to stop because of those who didn't make money then that's your choice.
@_date: 2019-01-29 16:21:11
I'm only one opinion so who knows man. I've also only been following this as close as my other investments for the past 6 years. Before that it was all second hand news from a few mining buddies. Either way, I plan to keep it in my investments and based on way too many things to type in here (you seem to have already made up your mind anyway and hey, whatever floats your boat I say!) I firmly believe bitcoin will continue to rise in both value and infrastructure growth for many years to come. I not betting hundreds of thousands on it, but after being a part of and watching countless tech projects evolve over the past 20 years, I have a pretty good idea of what will work and what will not. So a bad year here and there does not phase me in the least.

Those questions are purposely immature. You know exactly how security tokens are intended to work, and I assume you've at least invested in a REIT at some point in your life. All the expectations put forth in the crypto space and you find security tokens, the most straight forward use of crypto, hard to accept? I'm not buying it.
@_date: 2019-01-26 18:08:14
That's one of the most stupid things I have ever heard. The future fixes things, that's how advancement works!! Currently, the 
value of bitcoin for a transaction must be assigned a dollar amount, and you must use the exchange rate between the virtual currency and the dollar (depending on the country's law) on the day of the transaction. 
That's because it is so early in development, the system only accepts the dollar for taxes. Your putting forward an issue that would clearly be a NON issue if bitcoin becomes a mainstream currency, and it seems very obvious that one day it will.
Look, I get it - You want to troll and play devil's advocate, yada yada, but if you're going to evaluate the future potential of something, keep the associated processes involved relative to scaling process. Be a credible troll. :)
@_date: 2018-11-26 15:37:12
No, I work in IT and network security. My investments in crypto represent 5% of total investments. Real estate and stocks are by far the majority. I also have never for a second thought that getting rich quick was even an option outside of a lottery ticket lol. I have been involved in Bitcoin for a long time as well, but a few buddies of mine that have mined it since the early days are who got me involved. My opinion has not changed. 
The crypto market has taken on a life of its own. Bitcoin is still a tech under development and efforts to improve continue with a growing dev community. I'm no blockchain expert but any one who believes that ten years is enough time to see adoption of a new digital version of something as embedded in our society as money are technical illiterate. It will take generations. That doesn't change where Bitcoin is headed though, and there's no reason why an open source dev community would mysteriously disappear or halt their efforts just because of the market price. I guess if it got catastrophic and the majority of miners exited, then there would be less to roll out  improvements and test under a live scenario, sure. But even then I think it's logical to assume they'd keep going.

Not sure where you read it will go to zero but there have always been people saying this for years. Do plenty of your own research to get a grasp on where the value comes from, keep in mind that what's actually going on globally doesn't always reflect in the price until it catches up later, and don't get emotionally attached. I've loved having bitcoin as part of my investments for years! Some years are amazing and some are total shit, but it's not going away and it's a lot of fun to watch how far it's come.

None of those efforts with other coins are showing any potential to replace bitcoin. They have bells and whistles for features that Bitcoin does not need. In fact bitcoin is still considered the best use of blockchain, and this opinion comes from some of the top minds of developers in the space. 
If there's one thing that is critical to understand, it's that Bitcoin is far more likely to be improved, not replaced. Listen to a few interviews with developers like Jimmy Song for more insight into this. Things like Lightning Network are just the beginning of years if improvements via layers and upgrades coming down the pipe. People who think bitcoin will be replaced are probably reading this in fud clickbait articles, particularly older articles, as that was a popular fud angle for a while last year. Anyone still thinking this does not fully grasp the difference between bitcoin and shitcoins. Most of them are ideas, created to generate profits.
@_date: 2018-11-20 20:22:46
Yep ... there are more shit coins released into the market then we can keep track of! But it is a market and if you look at penny stocks on the traditional stock market, this should come as no surprise at all.

It is! But that would be cherry picking a saying that supports your personal stance, as there are hundreds. I mean that saying is almost as old as these:
**"Time in the market, not timing the market, is what builds wealth"**
***“If you aren’t thinking about owning a stock for 10 years, don’t even think about owning it for 10 minutes.”*** 
***"In investing, what is comfortable is rarely profitable."***
***“Only buy something that you’d be perfectly happy to hold if the market shut down for 10 years.”*** 
***“Forecasts may tell you a great deal about the forecaster; they tell you nothing about the future.”***
See? I can cherry pick too! :) Old sayings really mean very little.

No ...no it's not like that. At all. It's scary that after all these years there are still people that don't understand the difference between data, the network and the technology used to participate within this system. Understand where bitcoin fits in here as a hybrid entity, and then you will stop thinking that bitcoin will be replaced, and start knowing that it will be improved. It isn't going anywhere.

@_date: 2018-11-27 19:20:25
Who knows? Who cares? It's ALL speculation for now. Bitcoin is not being developed to trade it on a speculative market. Until Bitcoin fulfills its potential as a global ledger for transactions and as a blockchain accounting system, bitcoin will be worth whatever the speculators decide to pay for it. 
If the technology fails because of some catastrophic event then it will go to zero. But if it succeeds, and to say it that would take any less than 15-20 years minimum to even START is ludicrous, then it fails. No worry no fuss.  
@_date: 2018-11-20 01:34:06
Anything is possible, but honestly I'm being very realistic when I say the internet itself would almost have to come down to stop the growth of Bitcoin. The worst is over. Now the coin price will be up and down along the way via bull and bear market years, but the overall trend remains upwards.
@_date: 2018-11-29 00:20:51

Yeah, 10 years later and you don't see how that proves the whole "it's only hype" theory wrong? Payment method was a nice idea and will most likely be realized down the road. But you're telling me you are dismissing the growth of infrastructure and the entire crypto ecosystem built around bitcoin. You're just going to pretend that all the development, layering, LN, apps, atms, exchanges, mining companies, beefed up security protocols, proposed ETFs, Bakkt, SEC attention, etc that DIDN'T exist just 5 years ago is failure? 
Bitcoin is growing, and it's getting huge. Fuck the price that will continue to change and the high risk speculative investment use has become a big market that there will never be a shortage of participants for. Big players start the first buy in, millions more jump on the wagon, guess the top and take profits... this will never go away and the market has not even matured yet. The brightest developers including Jimmy Song have said over and over that Bitcoin is and will continue to be the best use case for blockchain and they have the most insight any human can offer to date.
Bitcoin has already begun to sync with society and the social collective and nothing short of an apocalypse will stop it. Agree, disagree, it does not matter. It has already begun.

The difficulty of the mining algorithm scales with the number of miners, as well as with the number of coins mined and the time taken to mine. That's the extremely simplified answer. The guys that got me interested in this space started out mining on older PCs, and it certainly did not cost 3k back then!
@_date: 2019-01-14 16:45:54
There will never be a shortage of people who are attracted to the crypto space as an investment opportunity. There will never be a shortage of innovative developers who want to improve it and be a part of the bitcoin evolution process. There will never be a shortage of participants who want to buy bitcoin low and sell it high. There will never be a shortage of people who support the decentralized dream. The world will never stop becoming more digital oriented as it moves further away from traditional mediums. Bitcoin is here to stay and so is the crypto ecosystem in general. Like it hate it, this is what it is.

So you said screw the whole "don't invest more than you are willing to lose" thing hey? :)
@_date: 2018-11-08 22:41:45
Honestly I don't think you are saying anything new or unknown. I, like many people have been saying that bitcoin is here to stay, and I've always said it could take years to change things related to how we do our finances. I've also bought when it was low and when it was high. After years in this space I've learned that anyone who constantly posts predictions, for bear or for bull, have some agenda...often to feel some sort of lacking sense if validation. Otherwise, why else constantly post in a preaching way, as though there's something you believe you know that the rest of us don't? 
I can assure you that there are no rules when it comes to bitcoin. No TA that has been accurate outside of pure luck and no way to predict fallouts like when we faced Mt Gox or spikes like the past 3 bullruns. You can say it will be years before the next ATH all you want, but I know from past experience that any given day a development could unfold that could send the price skyrocketing and you can be sure that the snowball effect of FOMO will kick in and interest will follow price... despite what you say. Just as easily, another development could tank it just as quick. Being realistic is easy, you just need to be aware of how much you don't know. Try it sometime.

You need to dig deeper. Your understanding of bitcoin sounds like it came from reading click-bait articles. This is what I work at for a living so I understand that many read about 'better' cryptocurrencies and the comparisons to old tech, etc. and believe that bitcoin will be replaced. That's nonsense. Bitcoin is already the best use of blockchain and this opinion is shared by the best and brightest developers in the field. It doesn't need do anything else outside of what it already does, it  just needs to be developed further for capacity and that will be implemented via layering and side chains, etc. Bitcoin is NOTHING like Altavista or the old Atari. That's actually the best laugh I had all day - thanks for that :).

Just simplify it. Anyone with common sense and a basic understanding of how tech becomes implemented into society, combined with the fact that we are rapidly evolving as a digital society, is not buying bitcoin because it can make life better right now. The development efforts for bitcoin are non-stop, and it's safe to say this will continue. Your credit card and it's current features took time to become what they are today. And that was based on an already established currency. Buying bitcoin today is a long term bet on the future. You don't go all in, you simply include it as a part of your high risk investment portfolio on the chance that this thing continues to transform and integrate with a future digital economy.

When would there be no fiat? I mean within the next 50 years or so anyway. Fiat and a healthy choice of bitcoin and other digital currencies will likely coexist for generations. There are political, cultural and economic factors that would have to be totally transformed before fiat dissapeared, and that's multiple generations away. Bitcoin presents money as digital content that is routable over a network without any middle man, and will take a long time to become a popular choice. People during the later stages of life tend to cling to traditional mediums, so for our lifetimes, the most we will see is the early beginnings of bitcoin as a popular alternative for currency transactions. Speculation will also remain a driving factor for market participation for the foreseeable future as a part of that progression.

It's the same with medicine, science and many innovations. Also, many of the technologies we enjoy today were birthed from war, porn and fast food. It doesn't really matter if you think it's stupid, it's fact. Bitcoin will thrive as a store of value, investment and eventually as a currency.

You seriously don't see why bakkt investors will love these prices? Look past a year...look all the way back.
@_date: 2018-11-20 18:51:47
Naw, right now it's a better investment than it's been all year if you're buying. Again ... it's about the perception of the market participant. And lots of holders are also buyers when the price is down, which compounded with newcomers to the space, eventually brings the price back up. A disaster of an investment for many this year. An AMAZING investment for many last year. Next year..?? Take your pick. Who cares anyway!!! LOL. Play in the market or give the money to a broker to put in high risk. None of it matters except what you do with your own money.
@_date: 2018-11-19 21:18:43
Man I hate to be rude, but that was the most stupid analogy I have ever heard on here. And I don't even get along with the OP, but your desperation to slam BTC is leaking out in your words.
@_date: 2019-01-04 15:29:32
Burned out waiting? Anyone burned out after a year never had realistic expectations to begin with. Bitcoin prices have only been going down for a year. Most people serious about accumulating bitcoin are not doing so for a year, they are looking year and years away. As advancements such as bio-metrics like you mentioned happen, so will advancements in the bitcoin network. I've never seen the crypto infrastructure grow as much as it did in this past year, and that's the trend to watch for. It's typically during lull periods in the price that the real growth and building happens. It's still early days and people waiting and watching have set unrealistic expectations. That being said, I would expect the previous ATH to be easily surpassed within the next year or 2, and price will catch up with infrastructure. 
@_date: 2019-01-12 15:43:39
Bitcoin IS blockchain. Nobody would have a clue what blockchain even is (you still don't clearly) if it weren't for bitcoin. It's hilarious that some people still say this, you actually belive that blockchain buzz hype lol.

I "see Bitcoin making strides as an excellent value store", means that in the not so distant future I believe it will first serve as digital gold before progressing on to become a mainstream alternative currency. Currently the value is in discovery phase and will continue to be volatile until it becomes more distributed. Saturation has barely begun, so going forward, there is a good chance that the returns will dwarf most other investment opportunities.

Plenty of people are buying, trading, etc. Nobody knows if it will move sideways, up or down in the short term but there's a hell of a lot more positive developments out there now days then in the past. The main thing though in all of this is to remember that of anyone says they know it's going to drop they are completely full of shit. Nobody knows.
@_date: 2018-11-20 21:47:37

Let's say you have 400k tied up in real estate and no spare cash. You  need 25k quickly for some reason, but as we know, taking equity from a home can be lengthy and a pain in the ass. If you had your money in tokens that represented real estate instead, you could cash out as much as you want, easily and anytime. Liquidation just became easy. Also, tokens would actually be very secure and the accounting would be exceptional.
@_date: 2019-01-14 19:34:01
Naw. You could say that any time the price dropped multiple times in the past. People sell and people buy. It's been that way for years and I fully expect it will continue with more participants going forward. There's price and then there's growth.
@_date: 2019-01-27 17:16:11
Please don't compare an emerging technology with multiple potential use cases as a  hybrid entity that can function to be exchanged as currency, as a store of value and facilitate and account for the exchanges ....to silver. Just don't. It implies that people are ignorant and I'd like to believe that people are at least informed enough to make comparisons that are logical.

Holy crap your posts are getting voted out of existence faster than anyone I have ever seen on any forum! The collective have spoken ... your input is garbage they wish to remove (and quickly by the looks of it!). When you think everyone else is wrong and you're right ... you're the problem.
@_date: 2018-11-24 17:36:37
Your just shallow and can't dig deep enough. Before tech is user friendly and easy to adopt, people generally want little to do with it. You're right about society adpoting new tech faster then ever though! The internet took 25-30 years to make it as a basic dial up in homes. Bitcoin already had 3 bubbles and will probably start to go mainstream within the next 5-10 years.
@_date: 2018-11-28 14:32:28
Bitcoin may drop but it will always recover. It's a container to hold a portion of your money. Anyone that debates Bitcoin's value needs to understand that the value is simply whatever combined amount people choose to put in...and there will never be a shortage of people who are willing to hold some of their wealth (even if only a tiny portion) in Bitcoin. When speculating price on the crypto market, it's fun to trade and short just like the stock market, but people need to consider that as Bitcoin continues to come out of the shadows, the more people that will likely want to throw a little cash in the game.
@_date: 2019-01-12 20:49:11
Just as I thought. You don't have any knowledge of this stuff. Stable coins and security tokens offer zero threat to bitcoin. They just tokenize what already exists. They are centralized and will offer no benefit as a value store over their physical form. They are literally completely different from bitcoin and will likely be purchased via bitcoin,  further strengthening bitcoin's use case. 
Besides troll, just go buy your useless shit coins and stop wasting time in a bitcoin sub.... unless you're a fake who is lying. It seems to me you're the one who has his head up someone's ass. Otherwise you wouldn't be posting non stop here, and have over 20 reddit accounts to downvote others and upvote yourself. You're pathetic.
@_date: 2019-01-14 03:40:03
Ha ha, that's still pretty funny. Nobody in their right mind expected it to be a mainstream payment method yet. Imagine revamping the payment infrastructure to buy goods all over the multitude of seller landscape, since that's where you seem to get your bitcoin has failed perspective. Thats going to take years. It isn't even a mainstream value store yet and naturally that has to occur first. 
@_date: 2019-01-15 00:03:42
You realize that it's dropped severely multiple times before and still saw an increase in market participants going forward right? So, despite your obvious effort to debate my point using semantics, I'm pretty sure you know exactly what I mean here. By your theory every time a market price drops it refelcts a shortage of investors, but that's just nit-picking. Basically, there will never be a shortage of investors to continue ramping up new ATH's. That worded better for ya?

Naw. Gold became a store of value because it was suitable for the time. There was no digital transfer of wealth and no digital society. Bitcoin will eventually  become a fantastic alternative. It doesn't need to replace gold or fiat, it simply offers an alternative that aligns with a digital society. If you think the price of bitcoin on the crypto market is a way to gauge what's being built in terms of infrastructure around the globe, then you've been living under a rock for the past decade.

If you knew anything about shorting, you'd probably understand that price does not go down in a straight movement and time on the short expires. Anyone can pretend they're an expert when look 'back' on a chart. If you were short yesterday before it jumped up 200 bucks then you lost.
Besides, anyone making money are not naive enough to think spamming bullshit in here could possibly impact price. Think about it ... if you were gullible enough to sell your bitcoin because of spamming posts from a user like that, how much bitcoin do really own? Anyone with any real skin in the game are smarter than that. No...people posting negatively in here day after day after day .. have too much free time or are paid trolls. And that is the actual bottom of the barrel.

Well, considering 2018 was a few weeks ago I guess one can think that lol. 
The launch of Bakkt’s Bitcoin futures and potential ETF's never happened in 2018 but are likely to happen in 2019. These could easily increase demand, and now there are also talks that the platform operators are considering adding other digital-assets. 2019 will likely see an expansion of the crypto payments sector, and partnerships like the one between Ledger and Crypto.com. A study from Visual Capitalist report shows the number of brick-and-mortar shops accepting cryptocurrencies grew by 30.3% in nearly 11,300 retailers worldwide. Plus, their forecast shows that the e-commerce and payments sector will experience exponential growth by 2021, rising from $528.2 billion to $885.4 billion. Then there's stablecoins which offer a convenient and safe place to put funds as Bitcoin and altcoins whipsaw back and forth for banks and businesses looking to enter in crypto. Oh and payments companies like Nexo, FOTON Bank and Revolut are already making it easier for crypto-holders looking to acquire capital or make crypto payments quickly and bypass taxable conversions. Lastly, the dev team are still working on bitcoin upgrades and new ideas for layering and sidechains, etc.
So no, you're not right.

Are you so naive? Relax most people don't have their life savings in here or anything. We lose money and make money all the time, it's life. Anyone with money in BTC is aware of the risk so most people are not as stressed as you may think. Why do people assume everyone put in more than they could lose?

@_date: 2018-11-19 14:14:02

A lot of people made a lot of money too in Dec, 2017. For some reason, few acknowledge this. For it to drop 90%, that required a lot of selling. I know quite a few people that made a lot of money. So whatever trick you're referring to, there are also plenty of people who didn't fall for anything - they simply did what many investors do. They sold it for more than they bought it for. To think there won't continue to be people wanting to do this for years to come would not be logical.
@_date: 2019-01-13 06:38:07
Well I suppose, if you were looking to sell it or buy something with it, but for me it was no more important than the years before when I was accumulating it at a lower price. I'm going to accumulate bitcoin and I like including it as a part of my investments. I'll want to sell it again in some years from now but presently these lower prices are much better for accumulation. So these are the days too.
@_date: 2019-01-08 15:47:26
Many see bitcoin as a growing alternative to gold, particularly now that is down significantly from the ATH and loads of headroom and saturation moving forward. In my opinion bitcoin will function extremely well as a digital value store before it eventually gains mass use as an alternative main stream currency once many more people hold wealth in the BTC blockchain.
@_date: 2019-01-20 12:45:02
Why, is there a particular thing you're referring to that happened, or just that you don't like the price volatility? Because these times seem a lot more positive than previous years, when there was much less development in the works.

@_date: 2019-01-22 17:34:15
You're somewhat right. That's where the large candles in both directions come from yes, that's a no-brainer. But the crypto community as a whole can, and have, moved the price in smaller increments. Both users and developers affect crypto prices a lot actually.  Crypto is still relatively young, so people are feeling their way through all this. 
@_date: 2019-01-12 05:20:11
Bitcoin will not be used as currency until it stabilizes as a value store first. Once enough people own it, it will be used to bargain and function properly as currency because there will be enough people wanting to transact with it to create the demand for payment infrastructure that can bring bitcoin currency use mainstream. The odd location accepting bitcoin and the odd person here and there who actually wants to spend it is simply not enough to create the demand. It will all come in time but first we need to progress from speculative asset to value store. Then from value store to currency. For now, it's a speculative investment that more and more players want in on as years go by. We'll get there. Stable coins and security tokens are in a different category. They simply provide another way to transact things that are alreay established. They do not threaten bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-01-15 23:35:40
It's actually positive. If they are using the time to improve the risk management, KYC process, anti-money laundering, and treasury operations, then they'll be starting off with a stronger offering. There's a hell of a lot more good news on the horizon then there was a few years ago I know that.
@_date: 2019-01-14 16:35:56


Yes, I agree. That is the takeaway. This is true for any currency in terms of an organically occurring currency anyway. People like to come up with reasons for value in gold with jewelry etc., and bitcoin with network value, etc.. Hell, I'm guilty of it myself! But the bottom line is that network value may help drive demand, but it is the demand itself that actually creates the value.  
@_date: 2019-01-13 20:22:19

@_date: 2018-11-20 20:16:55
LOL, simply play the market or don't. My point with the above post is simply that there is no way to predict that any specific tech will take hold. Very smart people dismissed the internet, the PC, cars etc. I'm not saying it's any worse to say that Bitcoin will 100% be a part of the future but there are two extremes to the scenario. Considering the foothold the crypto market already has in such a very short time, then I see no reason why it would stop maturing. Price of a coin is one thing, but the growth in this space in terms of infrastructure is rapid. If you dismiss that then you're dismissing a very important element of what defines future success.
@_date: 2018-11-20 14:36:47
The crypto Market may be the Wild West but it's still a market. And it's just getting started. So does anyone really believe that this Market is going to go away? 
On the stock market, if a share price falls, people usually buy it up... unless the company is going bust. Bitcoin is now stronger than it's ever been in terms of infrastructure, development, speed etc. So then why in the fuck is anyone worried if you're here for the long term? 
Even the bottom of the barrel troll knows that Bitcoin isn't going to die, it's just some stupid shit people have said over 300 times in the short 10 years that BTC has been around. They were wrong every single one of those times, so do you think now that we actually have a market with futures and proposed ETFs and Bakkt, etc, that they are right? Ha ha ..I think not.

Well that's the concept, but the tokens are tied to real world assets that may appreciate over time so very legit investments. A very real issue that needs a solution in today's world is liquidation of wealth.

Naw that's stupid. Most people still wouldn't even know where to go to buy bitcoin. You clearly have no clue as to just how tiny the fraction of people who bought bitcoin is ccompared o those who have not. The saturation is minuscule. People see low prices as another chance to get in the game, and that's why after these big 90% crashes it runs up again. Never underestimate human greed. Guess you'll just have to wait and see ol boy. Just wait and see. If I'm wrong I'll still be here as always and then we can discuss then.

"simply put, not enough time has passed" 
This statement you made above is perhaps the most simple way to explain to those who claim bitcoin has failed, that it takes far more time then 10 years. Calling it failed before it even gets started is extremely premature.

You didn't read what I wrote there? I said the crypto market is not close to mature. And that's true. The world doesn't care that it crashed 2 or 3 big times and certainly not the multiple smaller times it crashed. People like to buy low and sell high. Period.

Well you have some sort of stubborn wall up. You realize bitcoin ...for the foreseeable future anyway, doesn't need to replace all other currencies right? It's an alternative, a new entity. You're talking as if people expect an exclusive bitcoin economy. Nobody expects that. The store of value use is the one people are buying and accumulating bitcoin for. That and the potential gain from the speculative crypto market. Yes, most of us who support bitcoin would like to see it become a mainstream currency alternative, but the opportunity to make money has become the market highs and lows for now. Like it or not, the crypto market is huge and is here to stay. Your arguments are based on the initial whitepaper. Things change. Nobody knows what the future holds for bitcoin but it's safe to assume bitcoin is in it.
@_date: 2019-01-15 23:17:48
The closure of the SEC and the CFTC has put all key developments on hold, not just bakkt. Bakkt is in a holding pattern until regulators can open a 30-day public comment period which is required. They can't do that with the  government shutdown! The government shutdown just hit the record for the longest shutdown in US history. In short, this is nothing to worry about and does NOT reflect anything negative on bakkt.

@_date: 2019-01-29 17:02:55
I would need a lot more than this space to communicate it properly, but it mostly has to do with the digital transaction of money as routable content. A credit card transaction involves an enormous amount of middle men, and what may seem simple to you is way overly complicated. It also involves multiple points of failure, and protecting us from these risks costs a lot of money. Bitcoin however, is self-maintained and removes all the complications and costs of accounting, security, verification, etc. When something is more efficient, it usually gets implemented once it's tweaked to an acceptable level of production. The thing is 10 years is not long enough to see mainstream adoption, but it is long enough to establish a strong foundation that has proven to be worth building on. Now is when the real innovation begins. We're going to see a lot of layers, protocols, side chains, etc developed to improve the bitcoin network, and it's already happening as we speak. 
When in the history of technology have we ever said, "OK the systems we have in place already work fine, let's stop improving them now."? Never! Yes credit cards and current systems work, but bitcoin can definitely work better on multiple fronts of accounting, cross border translations, and overall efficiencies in way too many ways to mention. User friendly interfaces and things like wallet address translations,etc. will be built and if the past decade is any indication, this thing is not slowing down.

100x hey? That's very specific. Now clearly the lower volume of participants in this new crypro market means it is going to be more vulnerable to manipulation until it matures, but please provide the study and facts that you got the 100X information from. I'd love to read that because I haven't seen a source for that in years of following the space.
@_date: 2019-01-14 16:40:29


You can't really mean this right? I mean can you say that with a straight face? The market is not close to mature, it is barely off the ground, and the saturation overhead is massive. Take a real look around, not just at the price of a bitcoin. This market is huge, but it's getting bigger and bigger and there will never be a shortage of participants who want to buy low and sell high. If you don't believe that you're kidding yourself.

@_date: 2019-01-16 03:37:46
"extremely early"? Really? Literally anytime before mid 2017 would net you profits if you sold anytime between Dec 17 and now. That was a hell of lot of people. Yet everyone forgets about the great year the winners had and just groans about the losers. The winners are the very reason so many people play the game overdand over despite each run up crashing down. They can see bitcoin attaching itself to more and more of society year over year. So why not grab the opportunity to buy into the market and try and grab one of the  bottoms and time a sell on one of the tops? The thing is doing the snake all the way up and it's got quite a ways to go.
@_date: 2019-01-12 20:22:25

That's for sure... I steer clear of predicting anything in crypto or stocks. Only thing I'm betting on is the continuation of maturing in the crypto space. As for when, how or what will occur? I shouldn't dare fathom to pretend to know after the past few years of complete spontaneity lol.
@_date: 2018-11-20 20:49:47

@_date: 2018-11-20 18:24:21
Nobody called you an idiot because you guessed a price point. I think they called you an idiot because being validated and seeking credit for your opinion makes it obvious that you're making this all about you.
Wise up man, this is not about bitcoin dying, it's a fucking market and prices will go up and down, that's what markets do...and this market is still largely speculative so expect crazy moves. A LOT of people enjoy playing with risk money in this new market and unless you've been living under a rock, you may have noticed that Vegas, horse racing, sports betting, and high risk stocks are a HUGE industry. 2017 was great, the past year was bad and maybe next year will be either who knows. Look at what this is and stop trying to bait the crypto enthusiasts with your BS.

The ones i mentioned alone are gigantic. The world spends billions in interceptions of transactions and maintenance. But there many other advantages yes. You didn't 'want' the current version of your credit card. It showed up in the mail, as a replacement for your previous card. Technology has a way of creeping into our society. Younger tech savvy generations love the concept of crypto. Bitcoin is a push - NOT pull system. Someone has your credit card they can pull from it without you initiating the transaction. It aligns with pretty much everything else in society in terms of digital, routable content. Our music, our work, our communication, has all turned into digital routable content. The next logical step is money. 
Not to mention, Bitcoin is global and not tied to any one country or region. It's cheap to send, regardless of the amount you're sending. Currently we have many different currencies in the world, but Bitcoin is a global generic for ALL. If you want to convert from one currency to another, there is no middle step you can choose to hold the value in. Sure we have gold, but try liquidating gold in a simple click online. The potential of bitcoin is not even completely discovered, and already it looks incredible. 
@_date: 2019-01-02 05:18:21
Sure thing. You have to be aware on some level that people have been saying exactly what you're saying for years now since before it was a few hundred dollars. Even back then it started sounding ridiculous and that was before there were exchanges popping up everywhere, a huge increase in the number of Bitcoin ATM's, multiple developments and layering solutions, proposed ETF's, bakkt, an entire crypto ecosystem, apps, and much more. In general, it's a rapidly growing bitcoin infrastructure. You seriously believe that after surviving 10 years of massive challenges, that it will go away now with all this additional integration with society?? Forget about the price movement and think with logic. You'd have to be the most stubborn person on the planet to not acknowledge that you're wrong to dismiss the long path of growth bitcoin still has in front of it.
@_date: 2019-01-15 13:14:31
Sorry buddy but you're wrong. I've been working in network security for many years and I gaurentee you are wrong. Not one technical professional will ever tell you that bitcoin will be replaced. That kind of a working foundation will be improved. The only idiots saying Bitcoin will be replaced is old school economists, because they are technically illiterate and tend to defend their good ol fiat based concepts.
Look, as for your shallow understanding of networking I forgive you. The internet is a communication tool ...sort of. It's actually much more but anyway. Bitcoin is a currency, store of value and investment asset so far...it may even go on to serve more purposes.
But they are both first mover NETWORKs. You don't replace networks, you improve them via upgrades and replace the hardware that runs on them.
Don't worry, time will tell all and you can discuss this with me then... if you are still here to admit you're wrong that is. In the mean time, why in hell are you buying bitcoin if you feel this way? And don't say you're in a bitcoin reddit sub to geek out on discussion. I've been in this space many years and I know bullshit when I read it.
@_date: 2019-01-22 14:00:27
Someone told you bitcoin was like a stock because the word 'market' get thrown around...and you believed them?There are countless options for divi stocks, and I try to kep at least 50% of my investments in them. An investment in bitcoin is a bet that you will see a large return - could be in a year from now, could be in 10 years. I suggest spreading your money around stocks, GICs, crypto, and real estate. Bitcoin has a future in my opinion, and I think it will play an enormous role in the economy of future generations.
@_date: 2018-11-30 16:05:09
I keep it simple. For every 1k I pop into stocks, I pop 50-100 bucks in Bitcoin. Been doing this for a very long time - it adds up. I'm thinking 5-10 years from now there's a great chance my future self will thank my past self... or I'll have an "Oh well" moment. Little to lose, lots to gain. Simple.
@_date: 2019-01-16 14:13:11
Are you referring to just 2018 or since bitcoin has been a thing? Either way, a LOT of people sold last year. I don't know the exact number of people and let's be fair here, there are big players that move as much money's worth of bitcoin as 100s or even thousands of small players.
But there was just as much money made as there was lost is the point.
@_date: 2019-01-28 18:50:11
Naw, I don't see it that way. Selling for tax reasons would be done now.
@_date: 2019-01-18 14:57:37
Things are actually moving fast with bitcoin, despite how slow it may seem to many who are hoping for a price increase. I remember reading articles in 2015 that talked a lot about how universities will be teaching bitcoin courses in 20 years, and the price of a single bitcoin would be triple what it was then. Well, it's only been 3-4 years and that much has already been accomplished. Bitcoin is not a stock that represents a revenue generating business. It's about building the future, and an investment in bitcoin is a bet on that future. The sooner all the people who keep comparing bitcoin to a stock share and whine about the lack of intrinsic value grasp this, the better.
@_date: 2019-01-10 16:19:52
Yes it is. Think harder.

Bitcoin is the internet in this scenario. Bitcoin in 10 years will look much different from today. What did you think they're just going to stop upgrading after the Lightning Network? Or even if you'd like to use the computer analogy, MS Windows is still MS Windows just highly advanced from 3.1.
@_date: 2019-01-12 17:55:02
Oh well guess you won't be buying any bitcoin then, and will just keep regurgitating the EXACT same tired old arguments from years ago that have been already proven wrong, in a reddit sub for something you think has no future. Because that makes sense, lmao.
@_date: 2019-01-29 20:33:52
Excellent points. Also, with bitcoin the cost of reimbursing and detecting fraudulent action is reduced to a tiny fraction of what it is with the current system. Bitcoin is a self maintaining accounting system on a network that eliminates the middlemen and is facilitated by exceptional math. Once these benefits become realized on a global level there will be no turning back in my opinion.
@_date: 2019-01-30 14:04:27
Absolutely nothing. It's speculation fueled by shitty clickbait articles. Selling is becoming more and more exhausted and if we have not already hit bottom, then it's likely close. When you read all that crap about bitcoin going down way further, it's efforts of manipulation. And it doesn't just occur in the downward direction either - when headlines were calling for 100k by the end of 2018, that too was clickbait and manipulation. The best strategy is, and has always been, follow developments in the space, use common sense, and buy small amounts at a time to keep your average buy in check.

I don't need to convince anyone of anything. As I said, money is not digital today, you're confusing the transfer of currency over digital medium with the entity itself actually being digital. The fact is bitcoin is significantly less expensive and significantly more efficient. I work in technology with network security and have been involved with countless tech project over the years. I personally don't see how bitcoin will not continue to grow as it has done for the first 10 years. In my experience efficiency is not always obvious to the end user but implemented and synchronized with the social collective because of the savings and advantages in the back end. I grew up without internet and as it became mainstream, nobody asked for it ...it just became what it did because of it's benefit to the social collective.
My advice to you is to not buy crytpo because you don't seem to be onboard. So people with my perspective will buy in, people with yours will not. If it doesn't continue to evolve, then I guess it was not meant to be. I'll still have plenty of other investments and interests to focus on. All the best!
@_date: 2019-01-22 14:51:22
He's right. If you have ever owned a rental property, you'd relate to this. Real estate can drop in value significantly, but because you still see the physical building or land, and you still receive your rental income, you tend to not be as concerned that the property is valued lower. With Bitcoin however, we tend to see the lower value as a 'loss', but technically that's only the case if you sell it when the price is lower than what you paid. 
Oh, and it does not matter that he's 70, that only makes him wiser because he's seen more of what has changed over the years and what has worked. Donald Trump is 72, and like him or hate him, he's running the most powerful country in the world.
@_date: 2019-01-15 13:04:48
It makes perfect sense. For me pereonally, I should have sold less years ago and more Dec 2017, but so what? I still made money and I've had this exact discussion with many people 3 or 4 years ago. People literally said that too many were burned when it dropped 90, people were too turned from it after Mt. Gox, yada yada. And guess what? More investors still showed up! And they will again this time because yes, despite what you think people actually do like to buy low amd sell high. You talk like everyone lost on the last run up. Do you realize how many people made a lot of gains by selling between 15 and 20k?? A LOT of fawking people. You think that's not going to happen again? Please... don't tell me, ask me.
@_date: 2019-01-16 22:52:27
Idealy diversification would still be key. Some investments in security tokens, some in stocks, some in real estate etc. Plus it's a great way for the average Joe to own a piece of something they could never otherwise afford.

Sure man. The launch dates were announed to millions, and I repeated what I read. Don't let it bother you. Like I said, if this delay goes on for months when the government shutdown is not a valid reason? Then call it what you will. For now, let's give them a chance.
@_date: 2019-01-15 17:46:26
As I said, I have been having this conversation for years. Surely you didn't need me to spell out that I don't mean infinitely. It is so incredibly early in terms of how few people have even got on board yet, that I mean it will take years before we reach anywhere near market saturation. Bitcoin keeps growing on the back end with upgrades &amp; infrastructure and as more investors jump in the ATH's continue to grow. There is absolutely zero evidence that this will slow down anytime soon. We get a sell of and the builders build. Then we get another phase where Bitcoin steps further out of the shadows and into the public. 
Now that we have Bitcoin talked about on news segments, apps popping up everywhere, proposed ETFs, bakkt, exchanges beefing up security, layers like lightning network, side chains, and the list goes on and on and on ....now you think it's going to ease off? It never eased off before and we had none of these things. Think about that. There is no stopping this train my friend. 
@_date: 2019-01-15 19:18:36
Many innovations over the years have been mass adopted for a completely different purpose from what they were initially created to fulfill. We see this all the time. Bitcoin has a much better use case as an investment asset and store of value. Once the price settles after market saturation has been maxed out, only then can we truly see payment infrastructure that will support user friendly transactions. This is literally generations away, and the Bitcoin of tomorrow would have to look much different than today. Bitcoin already functions as an investment asset and hedge. I only have about 5% of my investments in bitcoin, but I have really enjoyed including it in my portfolio. The journey has been a fun ride. I think people need to stop thinking about the currency use case and let it all play out organically as it is doing. The average senior (not 50 year old as you implied - many of them are very in touch with tech as they were raised during the times when you needed to actually configure your computer) won't be around to see Bitcoin as a mainstream currency. People laugh when I say we are in early days, but they have no comprehension of how long these things take. I was creating batch files long before dial-up internet advanced to high bandwidth, and I am floored by how little people understand about the time lines involved. They think implementing a new currency is like upgrading an iPad lol.
@_date: 2018-02-18 00:09:15
This recovery is early and fast. If this is truly the yearly recovery that we've seen on the past, it can continue rising through to December, and the price it could reach by then may easily prove those prophecies of 100k+ right. With the momentum of new investors and the promise of the future of store of value gold 2.0, nobody knows just how crazy high this can go. 
@_date: 2019-01-29 23:16:57
Lol. And you're taking the time to hang out in a bitcoin sub, to type this why?

What's next, headed over to the marijuana investment sub and tell them it's all hype?
@_date: 2018-11-30 00:12:56
It's all part of how technology attaches to society over time. In truth, these types of subscriber stats, along with new exchanges, partnerships, apps, green lit and proposed investment products, crypto related news stories, and of course advancement and development of the tech that are true indicators of growth. 
The price is speculative but will catch up as people deposit more and more money into bitcoin going forward - something that is rapidly becoming easier to do as the infrastructure expands.
@_date: 2018-11-22 19:18:11
Have you been living under a rock? NOTHING has come close to the reputation damage caused by Mt. Gox. Is your memory really that selective or were you just not involved then? And Bitcoin not only recovered but went overboard with its recovery last year (if price is what you're looking at). Fast forward to today and we have a stronger dev community and a growing infrastructure. The forks are no more than a by product of any rising entity because human greed and envy fuel a push to emulate the same success.
@_date: 2018-11-18 14:41:43

Maybe bitcoin hurt his feelings because he bought at 20k.

I have stocks I've held for years. I've done pretty decent with bitcoin over the past years but why are some of you talking like you just discovered bitcoin last December? And if it stays low this time around I'm sure I'm not the only one who would just focus on other investments and occasionally check back with crypto to monitor its progress. Everyone is so dramatic like little kids arguing over things that just do not matter at all.
@_date: 2018-11-26 14:15:18

If all these trolls think that it's productive to troll when there's nobody left to troll let them play with themselves all day, they're good at that at least. Seriously, have you even looked at the number of posts from each one of these loony bins? All day long posting the same EXACT shit.

You're stuck in a loop with your thinking. If everyone was like you we'd have no innovation.
Look, I get where you developed your perspective, I've invested in stocks and real estate for many years. What you're dismissing here is the CRITICAL difference between bitcoin and every other investment. 
You're missing the fact that unlike other investments, bitcoin's onboarding for entry into the market is scaling as we speak. What was extremely overwhelming to acquire for most people of average technical skills is becoming easier and easier every day to acquire. New apps, improved user interfaces, ETFs, bakkt, platforms to trade for goods, OTCs, and more being added to equation. 
Once the sweet spot of public integration is hit, the hype you thought was the peak will look like a tiny blip, much like the previous all time highs look now when compared to the last run up...even though there were people just like you saying EXACTLY what you are saying then too. And just like you, they too were wrong.
@_date: 2018-11-28 03:52:48
Yes, I will agree with that. And unless it starts to climb above the usual levels typically seen after these drops, we haven't broken that trend yet.

As opposed to spending all your time trolling with stupid posts in a reddit sub all day, which contributes NOTHING other than confirming you do nothing productive. Wake up call: you can post in here every minute and it changes nothing. Bitcoin will continue to be developed for years to come, and the crypto market will remain a speculative play ground for anyone wishing to place a bet on the future.

Of course it's gambling. So is investing in marijuana stocks that just doubled and tripled and then crashed recently. It's all gambling, just some are more "glorified" gambling, and the risks are lower in say a blue chip stock than a new start up. But then, the gains are always relative to the risks, particularly short-term.
@_date: 2019-01-15 14:16:27
Nobody knows. There is far more infrastructure for on boarding new buyers, and certainly far more awareness then there was in 2015. But I agree with you that it will take some time. These are the periods where the real building happens, after the heavy load on the network during the last run up identified and helped prioritize where improvement is needed most. I remember many of the exact same discussions, same troll posts, same bullshit naive comments saying bitcoin will be replaced (It won't - it will be improved). etc. So there is a lot of similarity but we'll have to wait and see. There are definitely new developments in the works with proposed ETFs, bakkt, etc, so who knows.
@_date: 2019-01-16 01:36:51
Lol, that's pushing it. Well, it's only a month since it was initially supposed to be launched, and since the government is shut down there's no way we can pin the delay on bakkt. That being said, sure... if this delay goes on a few months even when govt is back up running then it would be fair to start calling bakkt out on it. We'll have to wait and see.
@_date: 2019-01-15 01:19:50
This debate was had years ago, so I doubt we'll add anything new to the discussion. It's dated, like the pyramid scheme theory and the no intrinsic value claims. Bitcoin is still here after all those claims and critiques. Gold has characteristics that bitcoin does not have, and bitcoin has characteristics that gold does not have. But bitcoin is far more aligned with future digital societies than a shiny rock dug out of the ground that suited the ways of days gone by.
@_date: 2019-01-06 19:43:13
It's not gold, that's simply a play on words and you know that I'm sure. Gold has characteristics that Bitcoin doesn't have, and Bitcoin has characteristics that gold doesn't have. But which do you think is more aligned to move forward with a digital society? When gold was put in place as a store of value, there was no digital communication, entertainment, digital data, etc.
For a global, decentralized digital store of value and currency to go mainstream is actually a very logical next step.
@_date: 2019-01-28 23:27:29
This thing is barely even of the ground. A lot of rocket launches crashed before they got one into space. Bitcoin is building the future of digital money as we move deeper into a digital society. The fact that people use just the one past year to evaluate bitcoin is insane. If you look at the past decade, I mean really look at the developments, the exchanges, apps, overall growth ...including the price which was pennies just 10 years ago, then you see clearly that this is taking off and the past year is not the big picture.
@_date: 2019-01-26 20:58:38

Look you just need to get more information, sorry if that makes you feel defensive but you're massively uninformed. So many people would buy bitcoin if they felt confident in the process, but it's as foriegn to most average people as rocket science is. Go ahead...ask around. Here on this sub it might seem like most people have a decent understanding, but this sub does not represent the average person. I am speaking from years of digital marketing and IT experience, plus years of investing, not from my ass.
@_date: 2019-01-28 13:30:51
There's just no way to know. Buying in smaller portions and averaging in is the only way to mitigate the risk of going all in at a price that may or may not drop. Selling seems to be exhausted but we all know anything can happen. The main thing is to not assume anything with price movement in either direction because again, nobody knows if the price will continue to move lower or not. Nobody.

This is no news.

I really don't see what all the fuss is about. Short it down and buy it up. The crypto market is growing and price fluctuations are only helping it become more active of a market.

You're benefiting from most of those things, unless you think the comforts we have in a first world country were free.

Because one was a company running on a network and bitcoin is the network. Bitcoin will be improved not replaced. It's only now that Bitcoin's network finally has 10 years of proven tried and tested use under its belt with a great track record of security and uptime that is worth building on. That provides a foundation. Companies won't be built on bitcoin, economies will be.

2/3 of the world's wealth is not is held in currency. It's held in assets, real estate, etc. There are many benefits of tokenization, but the best example I have heard to explain it would be this: 
Consider that there is art, some on display in museums, some held in private storage. Often a museum will work out a deal with a private owner to let them display the art in exchange for keeping it safe for the owner. Less wealthy people can't invest in expensive art because the pieces are way beyond what they can afford. If the art was sold via digital security tokens, hundreds or even thousands of people could own a small portion of an expensive piece, buying as little as 50 bucks or thousands if they prefer. For many sellers, this is a much easier way to sell than finding a single buyer. As the art appreciates, the investors all make money. This can be applied to almost anything and is a game changer that will receive instant demand. Keeping it all in the crypto ecosystem, it is almost certain that bitcoin will be the currency used to buy various tokens within security token exchanges and this may end up being the strongest use case for bitcoin as a currency that we've seen yet.

You are MASSIVELY under educated. The ten years is what makes bitcoin valuable. It doesn't need to do anything other than what it does and improvements upon what it does will continue to come down the pipe via layering development. Please learn more before you make these comments in a Reddit sub full of people who will instantly identify your ignorance. Plus you owe it to yourself to understand the difference in a ten year running network with actual hash power versus some alt coin that is no more than an idea on a whitepaper with no functional network that was designed only to capitalize upon ICO greed. GET EDUCATED or get out.

Not all tech gets replaced because sometimes they take that network without any company owner and make it better instead instead of replacing it? Because that's what centralized companies actually use without any of them owning it. Mind....blown.

Exactly.  Nice to read a comment that actually comes from someone who gets it.
@_date: 2018-02-02 16:24:25
Instead of looking at the past few hours, look at the past 9 years. Then consider that it's a proven technology that is also relatively new and growing year over year. There's also the Lightning Network update that's underway and far more points of entry to a new tech savvy generation. That makes long term holding pretty logical. If you need to get out now for financial reasons and take a loss from buying it when it was a higher price, then I suppose you have to do what you have to do. But a year from now, it will likely be higher if it continues on the trend of the past 9 years.  
@_date: 2019-01-10 20:12:12
As always with Bitcoin, patience is rewarded. It hasn't changed in years and it's sure as hell not going to change now that the infrastructure is being built much faster. Slow and steady wins.

Lol, try harder. Transactions have been steadily increasing for a while now, and not just in spikes as hackers try to wash their coins. I know you like the doom and gloom stuff but if you think stolen funds dominate the transaction volume to produce that kind of impact, you must think there's a lot more stealing going on then anyone else seems to know about. From multiple reports I've read, more people are purchasing smaller amounts. As far as I'm concerned, that's how it should be!
@_date: 2018-11-22 22:22:29
You didn't need to write a paper in it but you have at least researched before commenting. The fact is nobody wanted any of the most revolutionary technologies of recent times. It's because, wait for it... they didn't see how these things could provide value. They just couldn't envision solutions that didnt exist or how they would be of use. Especially the internet! Sound familiar??

Come on try harder, that was weak. You want me to reveal on a public forum how much Bitcoin I own? That's fucking hilarious. You can insult my Reddit username all day every day and accuse me of saying whatever bs you want or owning 2 satoshi. Only a moron broadcasts his stake on Reddit. Oh...wait, nevermind. You are a moron lol.
@_date: 2018-11-19 19:02:04
I don't think you are 'required' to see it or that we all see the same things. I have worked in IT and network security for many years, I can't help the fact that I see numerous similarities. I could go on forever but starting out in a niche environment, improved via layering and protocols, considered useless at first, laying down groundwork for future potential, being criticized for its energy use, bottle-necked due to processing power of the day, and so much more I could literally be here for ages typing the more technical similarities involved with the open source contribution and review.
The biggest thing is that people almost always fail to see potential until it is realized. So when I feel I see a glimpse of potential I invest. It's worked out great for me so far (fingers crossed). For example, just a few days ago $600 million in BTC was sent overseas for a cost of 7 bucks in fees in minutes. If you're aware of what this normally costs in time and fees, you can see just one of many potential uses of BTC.
@_date: 2018-02-12 13:17:53
Same mechanism that drove them way down recently. Many altcoins have made groundbreaking progress, only to have been drove back down by the recent correction in bitcoin price. It can indeed get frustrating to see some of these incredible projects remain so tied to the Bitcoin price, but since they are valued in terms of what they are worth in BTC, this is the way it is.
@_date: 2018-02-02 15:07:41
Of course it doesn't have to go back up to its ATH. That's a detail of 'how much it will go back up" that nobody knows for sure. However, given the past 9 years of data, this is a recurring event. Just because the last peak of almost 20k got more publicity, there's no reason to think the same thing won't happen again. ESPECIALLY since now it's easier to buy than ever before and it's slowly becoming an investment choice of the younger generation (who are becoming more a part of the mainstream investors every day as they get older). 
That being said, I personally hate the fact that Bitcoin is the entry point to altcoins such as VeChain and Walton which have a very promising future.  These are where new investment dollars should be able to go directly, not via Bitcoin. I think this is half the problem with all this. But onward into the future I'm confident we'll see opportunity to buy directly as a result of the demand to do so.
@_date: 2018-02-02 16:59:53
I've said this a ton of times but I'll say it again. First of all I agree with you. It's a growing technology, there's a new generation of tech-savvy investors who, according to statistics, would prefer to invest in Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies than the tradition stock market, there's updates and upgrades coming down the pipe such as Lightning Network which will for sure generate hype, and it's been embedding itself into our lives slowly year over year for 9 years now. And yeah, also the price is going up dramatically in the past few years :)
@_date: 2019-01-15 18:43:12

In all fairness, while you may be right, this may also be the aggressive bull run many have predicted. Thousands of new investors throwing $100-$1000+ at Bitcoin creates a very powerful domino-effect upward movement that gains momentum. It's a difficult movement to stop until the price reaches a profit taking point. We saw this in December, and nobody truly knows how high it will go this time. Advising people to not buy may leave them having to buy at a higher price. I realize it's all guessing but I just wanted to contribute to the point!
@_date: 2018-11-26 17:23:48


The inevitable is that people will continue to buy, sell, short and trade because it's a market. People may be trading crypto and not company shares, but there's plenty of people with an appetite to participate one way or another. Selling pumps and buying dumps will likely continue as long as the opportunity exists. Tether may be shady but it is a very utilized trading tool. The more that traders want to shift BTC $$ into tether, to keep it on the exchange for quick trades, the high the demand for tether. It is an alternative possibility to the easy to assume wash trading theory.
@_date: 2018-11-19 19:11:20
Well nobody knows, but if you are going to invest in crypto, the smart people will be in now and average down any further drops ... because it's a hell of a lot better than buying at 20k. And make no mistake BTC is not going away.

@_date: 2018-11-19 19:08:34
Then don't... simple. Investing is approached from many people in many ways. If you allocate a small portion of your investments to a high risk, BTC is currently a great fit. Most investors have a high risk allocation that they are prepared to lose on. I see immense potential in this young technology and if I lose out that's on me. I've stuck with it for years, and I only see it stronger than ever.
@_date: 2018-11-26 14:01:25
Depends on how you look at it. Past week or so has been a trader's paradise. I am pro-bitcoin and the future for Bitcoin still looks great but this is a market, and new traders may be attracted to the price swings.

@_date: 2018-11-07 15:47:17
Exactly. There are a multitude of variables that influence search trends, but all charts show that with Bitcoin, it's actually price that drives the interest and not the other way around. A rising price leads many new investors to the table. People don't want to miss out on the opportunity and then FOMO kicks in. Likewise, when big players sell off, it triggers a stage of panic selling. 
Interest follows price when referring to Bitcoin. Ask anyone else who works in marketing and based on last year's data, they'll tell you the same.

Not buying right now! I'm not sure if you caught my post earlier this week, but I won't breach my personal rule of no more than 5% of my investments in high risk markets. Remember, I'm one of the posters in here  that only supports the potential of this tech and challenges Redditors who make cheap shots at other users.

@_date: 2018-11-28 01:59:48
What would you like then? For some little kid to come here and agree with you? I've worked in IT and network security for years and I personally believe that the Bitcoin blockchain has the potential to be the most efficient accounting system on the planet. 
I'm willing to acknowledge that it may never happen. It's not a personal thing lol. We're each free to support whatever we want, and at the end of the day it won't impact your life enough to sound as upset as you seem to be.
Counter what points?
Volatility - Of fucking course it's volatile, it's price is speculated in a brand new immature market and it's still being evaluated. This could go on for years!
You can hire an accountant. This applies to everything that has advanced. You could have argued that a horse &gt; car...at first, post mail &gt; email...at first, Well &gt; town water and sewer..at first...etc etc. Your accountant won't be better than a matured bitcoin in 10-20 years.
Banks and credit cards are already working, but again things improve over time and all I'm saying is that I believe bitcoin can easily surpass these current services. Also, as I mentioned, new digital generation may prefer bitcoin as it would align more closely to their digital society.
So, if you enjoy debating then I respect that. But if you're just here to insult then it's a waste of time. As I said, presently bitcoin price is not directly correlated to the technology because while there have been some improvements in the tech this past year, there hasn't been enough to justify a run up to 20k and then back to 4k.

@_date: 2018-11-26 00:45:10
That's what I always say. Bitcoin IS blockchain. Without bitcoin, blockchain wouldn't even be a part of the discussion. Bitcoin has a strong growing dev community, with 10 years of fundamentals to build on top of. Blockchain is buzzword hype largely reserved for centralized application. 
@_date: 2018-11-16 20:54:31
And where would all these people come from lol. The crypto space is minuscule compared to other investment spaces. Even at the last hype cycle peak, as big as it was, it only represented a tiny fraction of the potential investors out there. Price and hype are factors, but only time will open up the gates. I know people want to see their investments swell but personally I'm quite happy waiting this out. It might drop it might rise but it's not going away, and like all other technologies before it, it takes many years to integrate with society. 
@_date: 2018-11-24 20:54:43

That's because the bad news is usually over-exaggerated, completely fabricated, or a  crappy headline of an article that says very little or re-spins old news. People are catching on and now that there's many X more new investors jumping on the wagon, the sky is the limit.

Bitcoin will go back up. It might be tomorrow, it might be December. You know how people love to jump into the stock market when ever it crashes to get a good price point of entry? Same with this, it's common sense. Look at the past nine years .. it's pretty much inevitable. The only question is, where is the bottom? Anyone who sells it now after buying it at 12k, 15k, whatever, is insane...unless they just desperately need the cash right now I guess. But man, what a crazy loss they are taking needlessly.

"Dying" ha ha. Sure it had a terrible year for price. It'll have lots of bad years and lots of great years for many many years to come. The crytpo market is just starting, give it time.
That being said, no you should not invest your money for risk into it if you feel that way. There's lots of risky invedtments for your 5 or 10% of investment. Do what makes you happy but don't be naive and call bitcoin dead. It's had an incredible 10 years so far and we're just getting off the ground.

Actually, the pathetic desperation that literally oozes from such a large volume of troll posts indicates that Bitcoin has a very bright future indeed. There's no need for trolls to post negativity with such transparent drama if they felt it was just going to die on its own. Also, when the price drops, insecurity reveals itself as trolls who have been claiming death to bitcoin for ages get to feel better about themselves briefly as they get to kick it when it's down and hope to inflict the most damage possible while there's a weakness.
Trolls are, and always have been, the lowest common denominator on any forum. That being said they also make the rest of us feel pretty damn fortunate regardless of the trivial stuff. Because no matter how bad things get, it could always be worse - you could be a troll.

Particularly if you're acquiring your knowledge of bitcoin and blockchain from clickbait articles written primarily to capture traffic to generate revenue from ad clicks. I actually work in the field. Even though I feel I am a credible source of information in this vertical, I am willing to admit that of course I may be wrong about Bitcoin's future.

At this point, whether it continues to rise all the way past ath, or drop agan - there's one thing that's certain: Technical Analysis is largely BS. It's about as accurate as throwing darts at a board at least in most cases. Sure, there are some scenarios where patterns are detected, but with the crypto space predictability is very rare. I've seen so many TAs on YouTube and everywhere else, and most times they just couldn't be more wrong. Occasionally they get it right, but I suppose if there are 100 TA's per minute on youtube, there's gonna be a few lucky hits. Anyway ...screw TA's for crypto and anyone thinks they are worth a damn, by all means, use them as your beacon. Not me.

LMAO, you have called everything from 4k to 8k and maybe the odd 9k range. I have a prediction too - it might go to 9k, or 10k, or if things get bad it can drop to 8k, and if nothing happens it will stay between 9k and 10.5k for the next 2 months, but if things go good it'll go above 12k, and if there's an asteroid strike it might plummet.

OF COURSE THEY ARE. AT least the articles I've read provide past patterns, current news, a change in public sentiment, etc. Then based on that they say Bitcoin "could" potentially reach their predicted price. I can live with that. This guy however, is just shouting at Bitcoin, and provides no basis or even any indication that he even understands what it is.
@_date: 2019-09-26 18:36:30
Bitcoin is a small market with a potentially enormous future. Until the market matures over the coming years, players can make a significant impact on the price when they sell or buy large amounts of bitcoin. They often sell and buy to capitalize on futures trading. This then triggers the smaller players waiting and watching on the sidelines to follow suit in the direction of the price movement, creating FOMO (fear of missing out) in a domino effect of selling or buying. Eventually, as more investors enter the space and bitcoin becomes more distributed, this type of manipulation by big players should become less of an issue.
@_date: 2018-07-12 23:46:19
Wow, you're out of the loop. This is just the very VERY beginning. Look around. Read something besides those crap click bait articles. At least learn about what coders are doing at the open source level. Learn about the massive infrastructure that's increasing at an accelerated pace.

As I recall Blockbuster enjoyed many years of success before becoming irrelevant as a result of failure to adapt. The comparison is premature. Bitcoin is only getting off the ground.
The only way you'll come around is if and when Bitcoin becomes a mainstream currency, but even then you'll probably just deny that reality as you seen to deny many of the current realities of Bitcoin progress.

But given that Bitcoin has been dealt some heavy blows, and I mean the kind of negative publicity that would shut down Apple sized corporations, and STILL ..it keeps rising from the ashes, I'd say this beast is not going to be beat down.

That's funny - What you've done here is called contextual evaluation. I can say that the first rocket launched in space was a piece of crap and worth nothing because it crashed and burned. So I guess that makes rockets useless? I mean who cares if they improved the rocket by testing it under various conditions and implemented countless solutions to its early issues right? Let's just say it was worth nothing and completely dismiss the stages any innovation goes through to get to its optimal state.

They were companies, driven by sales, and in a completely different playing field than an open source based cryptocurrency. In time, once the demand for usuage scales up we'll likely see innovation in the interface experience between users and bitcoin transactions. I think value store and trading platforms are the biggest use cases right now, so the demand for user friendly transactions to purchase goods/services just isn't there yet.
@_date: 2018-07-29 00:07:00
Great comment, the whole 80-20 thing is actually an excellent way to put it all in perspective.
What really peaks my interest regarding holders of large amounts of Bitcoin, is that there are some individuals/groups out there that hold so much Bitcoin... If the coin price hits half a million or more as many have  predicted, these people would be placed in a situation of unimaginable wealth.
@_date: 2018-07-18 22:05:24
Well you know what they say, sometimes it takes a duck to get the chickens to all come out and join the fun. Manipulation may have been the catalyst of the last run up, and it looks like it could easily be kickstarting the next one too. Difference being this time, there's a hell of a lot more infrastructure to onboard people to the crypto train. The only position I would not want to be in now is a short one.
@_date: 2019-09-23 19:08:14
Lol, it's only been half a day. Maybe in a few months if bakkt really ramps up we'll see an impact on price, but it's always been after the halving that most of us are really expecting "major" price increase. Bakkt is significant because it is a sign of the times, and marks advancement in the space.

@_date: 2018-07-13 20:48:10
But that was because they were hoping on the small change ce that just maybe one of them would stick and get a pump to make them a quick profit.
Basically ... people were hoping to find the next Bitcoin. But Bitcoin is the authentic currency blockchain and finally has that first decade of network stability under its belt to provide confidence to warrant the investment of more effort from coders to build it into what it needs to be. It has the foundation that no other crypto has come remotely close to achieving. Nobody needs to worry about Bitcoin going away. It only just reached a point where it can really begin scaling.
@_date: 2018-07-10 13:50:52
Crypto has bright future most people agree on that but it takes time.
As for people who were burned, they are a tiny fraction of the number of potential investors, but again these things take time. Own some crypto, a modest amount that isn't going to stress you out and one day in the hopefully not too distant future, you'll be glad you did. That's the only real solid strategy unless you have some inside information on these pump and dumps.

Right! That was the one that used cyberbucks. I remember reading about a few of them. I guess Bitcoin's origin could be kind of a combination of this early digital cash and things like Napster's peer to peer sharing. I'd like to think Bitcoin will not meet the same fate but yes, anything is possible!
@_date: 2019-09-12 17:20:31
Bakkt has been in the works for over a year, postponed, etc. If bitcoin were a stock with news of an acquisition or product release, earnings reports, etc., then things can be priced in as investors buy the rumor and sell the news. But bakkt has the potential to impact bitcoin price far more if it turns out to be successful, because it would mean a growing number of people participating in bakkt futures. This means more purchasing of bitcoin, and more demand against a fixed supply. If bakkt is going to affect bitcoin price it will be over time as its user base grows and more bitcoin is purchased to buy in to futures contracts.

@_date: 2018-07-14 00:15:19
So that's what you got from my comment hey? The coin price has little to do with the future of Bitcoin. The price will follow the adoption in due time. In fact according to the coders and the exchanges, they take full advantage of these lower volumes to focus on improving the infrastructure. 
Anyway, you are just looking with tunnel vision at the market and not at Bitcoin,  so there seems to be little point in this discussion.
@_date: 2018-07-27 16:31:45

@_date: 2018-07-13 18:37:11
You can't get that concept through the heads of anyone with one-dimensional thinking. They only see the way it is now and think that because the Bitcoin network has been running 10 years it should already be successful. But it took the internet about 40 years, and this is money we're talking about..
 and that is an even harder thing to transition. It's coming though. Anyone that can't see it yet will have to open their eyes eventually.

If you're naive enough to believe the extreme in either direction of price movement then you're obviously new to this space. While Bitcoin, in terms of the crypto market side of things, has made many radical price moves, nobody has ever accurately predicted them.
@_date: 2019-09-22 16:40:48
Most bitcoin purchased in large buys to participate in bakkt will be OTC for the first while. Given time though bakkt can definitely help BTC go higher in price as the platform matures.
@_date: 2019-09-24 02:12:26
Nope. After. Quite a little while after actually. Many smart people believe it's due to miners holding on to their BTC once the reward for the same effort and expense gets cut in half. They don't release the bitcoin into the available supply so the price rises and they sell higher to recoupe the lower Bitcoin reward.
@_date: 2018-07-11 18:01:28
It's crazy, but it's math! :)
@_date: 2018-07-13 01:26:58
You're hopeless. All you acknowledge is the crypto market side of things. You're dismissing what I'm talking about when I say ownership of Bitcoin. Well respected business people are predicting it will be highly used for real estate transactions. That's one of many many applications. Global transactions that will take only a fraction of the time a wire takes. It goes on and on.
First we need the infrastructure to catch up and the layering tech to accommodate the volume. 
Why talk like you don't know how these things slowly become entwined in our culture?

@_date: 2018-07-17 18:36:42
I remember almost this exact same thing happening less than a year ago and they said the same thing you're saying now. In  fact, we could probably go back and look at the comments. What followed was snowballing momentum that inflated to almost a 20k coin.
@_date: 2018-07-06 03:30:41
Yes, of course I understand 2008. You're basing your case of value on preature estimation of that value. Bitcoin has the potential to provide a great deal of value and few people consider that the infrastructure to support mass adoption is only just getting off the ground. There's a lot more to Bitcoin than a coin on an exchange. If and when it reaches value that's realized and embraced, holding it as a part of your investment portfolio could be just as sound as holding Amazon.
@_date: 2018-07-14 05:54:58
No that is not what I am referring to. You are not able to have this conversation. You are not equipped.
@_date: 2018-07-18 03:42:27
If you're treating Bitcoin like 'any investment', then you might need a new benchmark.
@_date: 2018-07-04 14:05:00
For the past 4 months I woulds have agreed with you. This time however, I would say there's an 85&amp; chance you are wrong. The things that have changed are just too impacting and the amount of money that will flow into this space simply creates a market environment that is much more difficult to manipulate. Plus, why would market manipulators want to interfere with a real potential of another run to 20k and above? They would see the logic in waiting until higher price ranges to make a move.
@_date: 2019-09-03 21:57:28

This is nothing compared to previous years. If it really seemed scary though, and people started selling, that's the absolute BEST time to buy.
@_date: 2019-09-23 15:44:25
It will take time to impact BTC price, but the volume is ramping up fast, and if it hits 10000? Yeah, then we're gonna have to see price impact.
@_date: 2018-02-15 18:08:40
in case your comment/question was not sarcasm, and you honestly don't know the answer to this, there are many things that make Bitcoin more valuable including but not limited to:
Bitcoin has much greater security and stability, as there is more mining support and infrastructure behind it -  Bitcoin currently has around 10x more full nodes than Bitcoin Cash, and so is a much more distributed network.
- Bitcoin has been running stable for 9 years and counting, earning its reputation.
- Bitcoin has a limited number of coins, making the value scale with demand for using the coins, especially as a store of value.
- Support of a vastly larger community, and since perspective is a defining piece of speculative value, Bitcoin destroys the forked competition.
- BRAND BRAND BRAND BRAND BRAND ....when a company is sold through acquisition, did you know the brand is valued just like the rest of the company's assets? Bitcoin is first out of the gate, considered the catalyst for blockchain's popularity.
I could go on but I think this establishes the point?

Again, I am not taking about the ETF, or ETN, or similar, I am taking about the confidence it would generate and the spinoff effect it would have on global perception. Fawk , it's amazing how many people bring their stock market perceptions to the crypto space and forget what crypto is. So many people looking to trade it and invest in it, and completely dismiss why Bitcoin exists. It needs to gain legitimacy and solidify its place as an alternative currency. Being taken more seriously is going to require serious players to get involved as part of the adoption cycle. This is more than something to trade and gamble on and to imagine how this space is going to look in 10 years from now, you have to broaden your perspective way past the stock market mentality.
Read up on some of projects underway to improve transaction rates, peer to peer trading, real estate purchasing, etc. It's not just another stock like entity. It's a game changer that will take years to mature.
If you're trading it and shorting it and what not, that's the only world where you see crypto and that's the only way you'll perceive it.

@_date: 2018-07-15 00:48:00
Nobody knows when, but interest has been expressed. Regulatory clarity needs to be in place before institutional money flows further into crypto. Don't kid yourself though, it's coming.
@_date: 2018-07-14 04:09:13
Ha ha. Reality will hit you harder than most. It takes years to prove it has the potential before real effort goes into it. There's no research and development team budget like a corporation. The creators are open source coders. But that is also it's biggest strength and why it will only continue to improve until it fulfills the role of a real solution. Believe it, don't believe it. Nobody really cares what either of us think. This stuff happens with or without us.

A large volume will yes of course. Despite what some trolls and newcomers may say, the saturation of the Bitcoin/crypto space is minuscule. It's only now that we are seeing things like bakkt, easier ways to purchase, LN, etc get off the ground. In such a small space, a high volume on bakkt can make a big impact, but I would expect much of the volume from big players to be transacted over OTC, at first anyway.

10 years is a decent starting point for early adopters, but not nearly enough to expect any real mass adoption regardless of fees. Even though 10 years is not a lot of time, it allows Bitcoin in these early days to be tested under multiple load environments to flush out the flaws so they can be addressed.It's critical to understand that most people do not understand how the technology they use even works. With Bitcoin this will be especially true. Understand that you are an early adopter. Regardless of the fees, or transaction times, early adopters are already using or at least buying Bitcoin. The ONLY thing that will lead to widespread adoption is incentive. Currently that incentive is the potential to profit from a rising coin price, and personally I think that's a great start.
By the way, the internet was not invented in 93. The internet began with the tech in 1969 used by early adopters in a niche military use environment. During the first few decades, issues were found and fixed as they implemented protocols, packet switching, and a slew of improvements. It was YEARS and YEARS later that it finally found its way into mainstream use. I'm not trying to be nit picky, but my work requires me to be well versed in the history of many innovative technologies quite extensively. Also, please consider the process involved for contributing code to the open source community. Bitcoin is progressing extremely well, but the past 10 years is only a drop.
@_date: 2018-07-13 23:31:27
In serious trouble how? There's more infrastructure, mining software, SEC acknowledgment, peer to peer exchanges, etc, then ever before. The open source community for Bitcoin is stronger than ever, and the Lightning Network is the beginning of much more layering and improvements coming down the pipe. There have been well respected business people claiming Bitcoin will be an excellent fit for real estate transactions among many applications. We don't even have wallet address translation yet, and non technical people have no user friendly platform for onboarding, but it's clearly coming. 
Focusing only in the coin price is silly, but there's the fact that Bitcoin jas crashed like this many many times, in fact it's crashed worse at a 90% drop once. We are in early days, but I do understand that a quick look at the outside view of this would lead one to feel pessimistic. Just remember, in the early days of cars, the speed limit was only 20 mph, because they didn't want to spook the horses.

Right on time with the futures close as usual, but it may be much less of a drop than the previous close dates. We will see over the next little while I guess! If Bitcoin retains most of the gains it's made this past few weeks then it will be in good shape.
@_date: 2019-09-29 14:58:55
The maximum difficulty is a ridiculously huge number (about 2^224). So we're good for a very long time. Obviously the bitcoin algorithm would be updated long before any issue of reaching a complexity maximum were to arise.
Even quantum computing would require a quantum machine containing 1500 Qubits to execute the algorithm for cracking bitcoin in theory and the theoretical Google breakthrough achieved only 53 qbits. So we're many years away from that, and quantum resistant encryption is already in the works. All things evolve together. None of this is worth worrying about. Otherwise we'd be worrying about every advancement mankind has seen that could override previous security technologies. It does however make for great conversations and click bait articles that generate ad revenue!
@_date: 2018-07-24 15:37:23

- Bakkt is not even live yet. It is expected to launch on the 23rd of September.
- Bitcoin is nothing like a stock. 
- It's hilarious when people say something like Bakkt is already priced in. Bitcoin has been around 10 years and there are still people who can't see the difference between it and a stock?? You want to talk about Bakkt being "priced in" as if bitcoin were a stock? Then find me a stock that has news of an upcoming event like bakkt, within a business that will buy more of said stock, and where the suppy is fixed forever, and where there is no centralization, no marketing team, no earnings report, etc. "Priced in", ha ha ha, cracks me up everytime.
- Bakkt will impact price if it is successful and leads to an increase in the purchasing of bitcoin as more and more people participate in bakkt futures. Simple as that. It may take some time, as it grows, like any new venture.

You don't really get the concept of holding for long term do you? I've been through this with bitcoin so many times over the years it doesn't phase me.  I DCA and accumulate, so I bought at many price points. It's simple and it works.  I have rarely ever been down because I simply see all price drops as an opportunity to get more bitcoin for my purchase. I have been saying around the year 2021-2025 I'll consider cashing out and I stick by that. If you think you can time the market and deal with constantly trying to sell higher and buy back lower, that's your choice but DCA never fails. I'm perfectly happy with this because I'm very confident that Bitcoin wil be worth many times more than it is today and these price fluctuations will be irrelevant.

You need to give it more time to evolve. Oh, and that catastrophe test you mentioned? Bitcoin has the best chances of surviving this because it's global. 
So, unless the catastrophe hit the entire world, Bitcoin would survive just fine, that's one of the many benefits of blockchain.

It should slowly contribute to onboarding more participants and impact the price over time. As we know this is not a stock where company news is priced in. Public sentiment is influenced by news no doubt, but ultimately supply and demand is how bakkt should eventually impact price if it takes off with success.
@_date: 2018-07-04 18:16:58


Did I say that? 'Your lol of the day' really? Clearly your a kid, but that's irrelevant. I was a smart kid, so maybe you are too :).
Anyway, sentiment of the general public is highly influenced by negative information, intentionally manufactured to attract ad clicks and views, and in some cases they are paid articles to promote FUD. This is a known fact. Anyone that has lived through previous technology disruptions such as the PC/OS, space travel, cellular communications, post military internet evolution, etc, is well aware that most of the solutions that bring any of these technologies mainstream are simply not invented yet. So without vision, many people don't open their minds to accept things like Bitcoin or AI advancement, etc. They see only their present state and evaluate their future success without considering the innovation that will eventually bring them mainstream.
Now back to your comment - Until people are more open to adoption, we have to wait for time to do its job. Before you know it, you'll be swiping your smart phone to scan your Bitcoin wallet and pay for gas. So no, I was not simply refering to people not thinking it was worth investing in.

This perhaps the most clueless, uneducated, amateurish prediction I've read regarding bitcoin price in a very long time - and I've read quite a few on multiple platforms. I could pick this apart and go on and on, but you're clearly trolling so I'll just say that you would need to find some evidence that bakkt boosted the price by 2-4k, for it to drop it by the said amount on launch date. THERE IS NO SUCH EVIDENCE.
Just in the case that you're not trolling, then you need to get your head out of stocks and realize bitcoin is not priced on some earnings report or quarter performance. Bakkt is a platform with "sky is the limit" growth in terms of offerings, and it is the actual buying of bitcoin to participate in bakkt that has the potential to influence price. Sure, we may see a slight dip at first from small fries like you with the stock mentality, but 2-4k? Lol, I'll go with naw.
@_date: 2019-09-24 15:36:00
LOL. It's nothing, Bitcoin has always had periods of downwards price movement as it grows over time. Great opportunities to buy if you're looking long term!
@_date: 2019-09-11 14:50:28
We were on a down swing, releasing pressure since the bubble popped at 20k. Now we are on an up swing, building pressure for the next year or so anyway. Probably longer. These little 5-10% drops along the way are perfectly normal and have always been part of the price movement.
@_date: 2019-09-24 14:25:08
DCA. If we hit 9200-9300 range though I personally see that as an excellent buy signal and have some fiat on reserve for that possibility. The very fact that we're still here after the wild ride that the last decade has taken us on verifies this is an insanely lucrative investment if you have patience, but there's nothing wrong with catching the best price points. DCA for best possible end game reward.

I love how naive people laugh at things like cars, the internet, streaming, and now bitcoin before they have a chance to advance. You guys are always so cute when you think living in your little box makes you smart. Crypto isn't a way around evil and corruption, that's just a tell tale sign of the quality of news you read. It is however, going to be just that once it evolves. You're a generation too early with your little comment from the cheap seats.
@_date: 2018-07-06 16:42:56
Depends on the investment goal. Money you can afford to lose, perhaps a modest investment that you can drop on Bitcoin and not obsess over wouldn't be a bad move based on sideways movement of a technology that is in the midst of growing infrastructure. 
There are plenty of people that might want to make that move to profit on the potential of future growth. Just embrace a realistic timeline.

Total BTC fees have decreased by 85 percent, even during times since 2017 when the number of transactions conducted have been comparable to the peak of the market in December of 2017. There are several factors that have contributed to this, such as:
- SegWit
- Transaction batching (mostly on exchanges)
- Lightening Network (which will improve further, along with other second layer innovations)

There's a long list of reasons why Bitcoin will inevitably continue to explode onto mainstream financial operations (despite the close minded pessimists who  can't open their minds). But there's one reason above all else why Bitcoin will almost DEFINITELY rise to many X its current value... HUMAN GREED. As long as there's a platform for people to triple their money, there will be people pumping money into it. High risk stocks, Vegas, betting on sporting events, etc.
Now couple that with an actually technology that could potentially revolutionize the way we exchange value, and you've got a hell of a resilient monster that will continue to grow for a very long time. But anyway, NOTHING can outperform human greed. Nothing.

This is the same thing people always say about new technologies. All the issues you mentioned will eventually be addressed. It would not be possible to advance any faster than it currently is. I remember how we mused about video chatting back when the internet was dial up. I also remember even earlier, loads of people not being able to grasp the internet as a useful tool. There were newspaper articles claiming the internet was the biggest waste of electricity the world has ever known and that it would not amount to anything. Yet here we are.
@_date: 2019-09-14 15:07:42
I think so too. Bakkt are doing things right and have been making sure they had all their ducks in a row before officially launching. People have been so caught up in the delays and click bait BS, many have lost sight of just how incredibly big ICE are. In fact it doesn't get any bigger in the investment world.

Oh, you mean if EVERY single time you made your call you were correct sure. But I will continue to make mad gains on a potentially larger amount because I buy regularly. The little I bought at 12k is down but everything between 500 and 8.5k is now solid. There's a reason the say time in the market beats timing the market. It's because it's true. If you are able to win every time you sell then you belong in the book of world records.

* First of all, if I had a dollar for every time an analyst said crypto was going to die, I wouldn't need to invest in anything.
* Second of all, don't invest more than you can afford to lose.
* Lastly, you should not be putting money into something you don't know anything about - because (and I STRESS this), if you think there's a chance that Bitcoin can die next week, you don't know anything about it.

I agree ... level of awareness and potential to be considered in actual use as a currency and/or store of value. After 8 years that I have been watching, I finally sense that people are beginning to take Bitcoin seriously. Eventually, there may even be enough people wanting to pay with Bitcoin, that it can be worth a retailers while to accept it as a payment option. The next few years will be interesting for Bitcoin and the crypto space.

Banks may actually be HELPING the adoption of Bitcoin. People are saying "We want a decentralized currency that gives us complete control of our money. We earned it, and want to be able to spend it how we see fit, and we want to buy Bitcoin. Bank's response: No, we won't allow you spend 'YOUR' money in 'YOUR' bank account on Bitcoin.
  
Aren't they kind of supporting the case of why we need more control over our money?

How you can be wrong as much as you are baffles me but hey, that's your issue right? :) and today its volume more than doubled yesterday.

Yes, gold investment played a fairly large role in the life of a close friend / businessman. The 2008 crisis also hit me hard.
This debate is pointless. You are limiting your vision of the enormous value Bitcoin has and more importantly, will have. The digital value is there, it's not a physical bar of gold dug up from the ground only to put back in vault, no. But that's old school and this type of technology did not exist then. 
You can't seem to wrap your head around the fact that Bitcoin does not need to be a company or a physical hunk of metal to have great value and that's unfortunate. You're using the traditional concept of stored value, because yes back in the day the gold standard meant that money was actually backed by gold. And this is something we could talk about all day.
I like gold, but things can change, and no it won't happen overnight. But if Bitcoin's price stabilizes, it could very easily become an efficient store of value, particularly for a digital generation. It has the scarcity and security. It's also backed by the hashing power of a very complex and distributed global network. New protocols are in the works to address the potential of a 51% attack, and as we move forward many additional innovations will be compounded into the equation. Give it time.

@_date: 2018-07-17 11:28:40

That has little to do with Bitcoin. It has to do with life, choices, corruption and manipulation. Bitcoin was not created to be a bubble, or a scam, or a medium for manipulation. These things find their way into any potential entity that allows them to thrive. That does not mean Bitcoin will not survive in the need, once that crap is weeded out of the space.

The Google trends thing is not a good indicator at this point because most people know what Bitcoin is already, and are more familiar with popular  exchanges. Last year there was a huge ramp up on searches as people were discovering what Bitcoin even was.

You are not alone ..a bubble means that FAR more must have bought at that price range. Kudos to you for having the patience and the balls for sticking it out this long! Many would have wept and sold at a massive loss out of fear.
Nobody knows when we get back to 15-20k, but even the most adamant crypto pessimists with any foresight will now admit that this thing is not going away. It's almost certain to get bigger and bigger for many year so to come. My point? You'll get your money back.

The Bitcoin network with it's security, stability for 10 years, millions in hard and software, mining revenue, investment, exchanges, job creation, and global infrastructure developing at an unprecedented rate, and I could go on ...is not a utility? We need to redefine how we measure value when it comes to bitcoin because it's a new entity. But one things is for damn sure - Still claiming it has no value is far more ignorant than buying it.  
As a system of accounting with it's defined scarcity and mathematical attributes, bitcoin has massive potential. This is a VERY early stage to evaluate it though, because with technology growth, we rarely consider the innovative solutions that we haven't thought of yet. In Bitcoin's case this involves user friendly entry points, wallet address translation, layers for scaling and much more.

Oh my god I'm cracking up here. This is BITCOIN!! You can't use TA to any degree of accuracy in this! Does TA predict those huge pumps and sells literally out of NOWHERE? Nobody will ever see them coming until Bitcoin see much larger scale distribution and that's not going to be for a while. So, put your TA machine away or go use it on the traditional stock markets. There's a reason why up until January there were TA's on  websites popping up everywhere, and every other YouTube was a crypto TA. Now it's become a  public joke and 90% of TA's on crypto have ceased. If you want to be still trying to use TA to predict Bitcoin prices that's your call, but please stop trying to push it on anyone else.
@_date: 2018-07-10 13:11:57
Yes you are right but most people panic and give up their shit for cheap. Most people don't look past next week let alone the time its takes for things like this to mature and thrive. Holding a modest amount of crypto will serve anyone well if they can get past this day to day shit. It takes years to evolve and nothing can change that.

"Now you understand why the claim that BTC will replace fiat is retarded?"
Can you sense the condescending and patronizing tone in that statement? That's what this guy does in all comments. He truly believes he is correct!! Its astonishing.
If you want some really interesting perspectives from a few guys that actually have a 'real' credible perspective on the Bitcoin as gold concept, watch this debate.

Considering this process had repeated itself multiple times over recent years, it wouldn't be a stretch. But it's unlikely to be the last time. Coin price stability is still a few years out imo. People say just because it's happened over and over that's no reason to assume it will happen again... but the fact is, history is undisputed as an indicator of future events. 
@_date: 2018-07-17 18:33:28
Eventually most people will choose Bitcoin, because if you had to look at both Bitcoin and Gold objectively, Bitcoin is many X more efficient as a store of value. That will take a new generation to become implemented though. 
Imagine being raised in a digital culture, and deciding between a solid running blockchain network that uses mathematical accounting to digitally store your value on a ledger that is tamper proof, and provides perfect record keeping and a fixed supply ...to a metal with an unknown supply that is dig up from the ground only to be locked up in a vault and put back in the dark again. It's a no brainer. Gold was great before we evolved, but how incredibly closed minded would you have to be to not see the inevitable future. It's quite a ways off, but it's coming.
@_date: 2018-07-18 03:36:27

I don't want to be too premature on my positive outlook here, but if the futures closing doesn't drive Bitcoin down (and if you look back at previous dates of close you'll see that it has), then I'd say we're in for some serious price climbing coming down the pipe.

Learn what bakkt is, and how you need to buy bitcoin to participate in it. Then understand that it may attract big players who will want to make million dollar orders, and that the user base could easily grow over time as bakkt matures. Now, how exactly do you "price in" the purchasing of bitcoin that hasn't happened yet, when it is the purchasing of bitcoin that increases the price?? Bitcoin...is...not...a...stock.
@_date: 2019-09-09 13:08:49
That would require you to:
-  Have all your bitcoin sitting on an exchange (risky)
-  Identify the ATH. Is it 21,000? 30,000? 50,000? It moves fast during the pump to an ATH, so you better be able to move fast too.
-  Trust Tether. Do you? I mean to shift all your bitcoin into tether, and then let it sit in tether, on an exchange, for possibly a very long time?

Every time we go through this it gets easier, and the drama queens on here get funnier. I don't know what prices you guys are looking at, but the $200 bottom turned into 1k, which turned into 3k, etc. If you're worried about the price volatility, then you must need the money you invested too soon to have been putting it into Bitcoin to begin with. THAT'S where the drama comes from... well, that, traders, and lame trolls lol.
If you trade you're stressed out. If you hodl, you just find the Bitcoin community more interesting today than other days. The long term looks exactly the same.
@_date: 2018-07-24 16:53:10
Depends on the timeline. If it takes 10 years to hit 100k then maybe no higher than that. If it hit 100k in 2019 however, I may wait until 300k or higher. There's only 21 million BTC ever going to be available, so despite all the other variables and details, that fact alone means one BTC almost inevitably hitting massive value. 
@_date: 2018-07-28 22:52:16
It's too soon for retailers to adopt it yet. Most online sellers have no incentive to accept it, and ecommerce solutions with Bitcoin integration are nowhere near mainstream. Then smaller retailers wouldn't even know how to buy it themselves yet. What is the proven equipment to accept it physically on site? There's much more to overcome than the volatility of the price... there's simply just not enough confidence in the entire process of paying with and accepting cryptocurrency. 
It takes time and expecting retailers to invest in the acceptance of Bitcoin which they need to convert back to FIAT to integrate with their day to day finances is not reasonable. Maybe the average person in this Reddit group thinks Bitcoin use is common, but only a very tiny percentage of people even think of paying with Bitcoin, and thus a tiny percentage of any retailer's customer base. That doesn't provide a retailer with any incentive because it doesn't make any real difference to their sales and bottom line.
 
It would be reasonable to assume it's about 5 years out, but also very reasonable to assume it's coming. This is not a price volatility or transaction speed, or even a fee issue. It's common sense, because businesses need to turn profits, so once Bitcoin acceptance helps to I create sales, then you will see retailers accepting it globally. It needs more time, and once it really starts, adoption will accelerate.
@_date: 2018-07-05 00:17:22
If it was accurately reporting but it's largely nonsense. In many cases, if things are good in the market, they'll write about something that happened months ago and make the headline look as though Bitcoin is doomed. Or they'll just use a headline that implies something has gone terribly wrong but the article is just a TA that shows the coin price can go either way.
I realize that clicks and views pay their bills, but I just feel it's gotten out if hand. It's difficult to get accurate information if you use these daily crypto articles as a resource. Eventually more and more people may choose not to use them, and then what value do they contribute to society?

Too many variables to even guess. First we have to allow a natural progression to continue, where people who lack imagination and vision slowly open their mind as they see the future of currency forming in and around the cryptocurrency space. Once we get past all the close minded pessimists, and adoption of real investment kicks in, the plateau price may be far more than we even anticipated.

I hear many opinions on this, and have had lengthy discussions with several financial professionals and even with a few investors and miners who have been involved with crypto for over 6 years. It never ceases to amaze me how equally intelligent and informed people can have such differing opinions on Bitcoin ETFs and institutional investment. 
If I could have one request granted regarding how people Express their side of a debate, it would be the communication of opinion versus proven fact. Because nobody can state their opinion on something that may or may not happen as though it's a fact. Proceeding one's thoughts with the phrase "in my opinion" could bring significant respect and credibility to 80% of the perspectives offered in this thread. Yet everyone seems to think they have a crystal ball.

Anyway this got to stop before I start thinking everyone out there is a non technical as you.
Later man .... troll the little reddit section all you want. I am now convinced that anyone who could be possible naive enough to hold ANY ounce of weight in your FUD comments are not needed in this community yet anyway.
You should message direct Matt Corallo or Jimmy Song and give them your input on 51% attacks. They could use a good laugh, ha ha ha ha ha.

And again ... I did not say what you implied. As long as you assume or take things out of context, you'll never have enough credibility for anyone to take you seriously. But you're on here to troll anyway, so who really gives a shit what you think? NOBODY.
@_date: 2018-07-27 22:04:32
Your goal here was to generate a conversation I assume. Other than that, the rest of what you said sounds completely irrational and lacks all reflection of any understanding of how technology actually evolves. 
The first ten years? That was establishing a basic level of stability in the sense that the network is not going down and has not been hacked. That period is CRUCIAL for any additional thought to be given to it regarding upgrades and improvements. It basically provides the confidence needed to make the additional effort worthwhile. NO other crypto can even come close to having this period of stressed testing. Plus a currency blockchain does NOT need the fancy bells and whistles many of the others are outlining in whitepapers, for projects not even started yet!
The internet started in the 60's with a small niche group of government based users, and over the next several decades improvement were added as it became evident that it was a useful tech. They added layers, packet switching, etc etc. Then in the 90's it started in homes, and much later could accommodate high bandwidth video and audio transfers....and we're still adding and improving.
So before you say Bitcoin had 9 years to attract retailers, try and understand that Bitcoin has not even begun to attract retailers...but it will. It almost definitely will. It needs to become much more user friendly, it needs to be gradually adopted, and it needs to come out of the shadows as improvements, layers and investment on-boarding invites more and more to the space. It won't need the timeline the internet needed, because well ...the internet is the foundation of Bitcoin's network, so the global connection is there. But it does need more time than this. Bitcoin is about as progressed as it should be at this point in time. When it actually hits though, I mean really sticks? You won't need anyone to tell you about it, put it that way.

Yes the whole world is wrong, including any financial expert or brilliant coder that feels there is a bright future for Bitcoin. Everyone!

I wouldn't call it a boom, but I'm sure that bakkt is one of many developments that increase a positive public sentiment. Ultimately, bakkt can impact price once it is up and running. If it is successful and a growing number of large players purchase bitcoin to participate in physically settled bitcoin futures, then yes this can contribute to a higher price.
@_date: 2019-09-24 17:44:34
Once again - no crying here, and no clue why you include me in that tribe simply because I call you out on your BS. Predictions are oxymorons, and you obviously have zero ability to accurately make them. Nobody can make them with bitcoin, not even my mining buddies who have more insight then most everyone on this sub combined. Otherwise you'd be ridiculously wealthy and the last thing you'd be doing is hanging out here pretending you can make predictions.

Anyone that has not yet watched the debate debate between  American stock broker Peter Schiff  and ShapeShift CEO Erik Voorhees, it was pretty cool to see how Erik swayed the crowd over to a positive perspective on Bitcoin's future.
Erik won the debate and shifted the crowd from 40&amp; believing that Bitcoin will be able to serve as digital gold to 55&amp; believing. He did a great job as an ambassador for Bitcoin!  
@_date: 2018-07-12 15:34:58
Just another day. Big players pumped it a few times over past few weeks and dumped it to grab profit past few days. Right back to where we were... so the reality is, without those market manipulators we're moving sideways.
That's better than the downward trend we were on, and with the right conditions, can eventually lead to an organic run up.
Look, if you see a huge green candle of growth that occurs within a 20 minute period, that NOT organic. Let time do it's job and when you see increased volume and smaller incremental upward movements that continue and form a trend...then you can call a potential bull market coming. 
Bottom line - Relax and let time do its job. You cant convert a monetary system overnight. Traders will gamble and holders will play the long game. There's no wrong or right, only your stance on it all.

If you used pattern recognition, you'd have noticed the lull this past month. For the first time since January, the crazy spikes and drops reduced significantly, and the price floated between 6k and 6600 moving sideways for the past month. This set a pretty good stage for another run up. Nobody knows for sure, but I would not want to be shorting during this period.
@_date: 2018-07-10 17:21:51
Yes ETFs will provide many with an easy point of entry and if they are offered globally, the volume will prevent smaller groups from synchronizing market manipulation. It may actually contribute to manipulation short term, but long term yes, this would be really good for crypto and for legitifying investment in this space.

It's easy to criticize Bitcoin when the coin price is down. Many people are so very stuck on the market aspect of Bitcoin they have no ability to comprehend the efforts underway to bring Bitcoin mainstream as a currency. It's almost as if they deny the potential intentionally to fulfill some agenda.
@_date: 2019-09-30 10:39:39
It doesn't work that way, and they aren't called classical computers ... that's a music genre. It's like you never read a word I said. Bitcoin may be more disruptive, but it is like any other tech and can  be upgraded infinitely. Think about how far we've come already with encryption. Imagine where post encryption tech is headed.
Computers have not continued on the sane pace of advancement because the efforts shifted drastically from speed to package size in recent years, to support mobile computing. Many think that speed will once again become the main goal so I guess  we'll see. There's a lot of challenges to overcome but we'll get there. The key to faster computing has not yet been discovered. Open mind thinking is required, just as it is to accept that bitcoin is not going away.
@_date: 2018-07-08 01:15:51
The solution to this is volume. A colony of ants can take down a much bigger insect and even small mammals. The greed is real and so is the manipulation but once the volume kicks in, the manipulation gets wrecked. 
Which is why ETFs will be good, not bad for Bitcoin. An ETF could place a big demand on a limited supply and improve public perception of legitimacy. The doors for market manipulation were already opened with futures but at least ETFs will start a domino effect of incoming Money to the space.

I don't think most average people even heard of Bitcoin until last year. I do however think that many younger people will drive the adoption of Bitcoin as they transition into mainstream consumers and investors. My optimistic opinion is based on a fairly lengthy timeline for Bitcoin. I believe that realistically, within 5-10 years we could see serious growth in Bitcoin adoption as a currency choice and yes, I feel this will positively influence the price of the coin.

Your brain has been trained to perceive value in the way we traditionally hold it. Bitcoin is a new 'hybrid' entity and trying to comprehend the value in a traditional sense is futile. You need to open up your perception to what can be and what will be. You think anyone in the 60s's would have even envisioned the internet, AI, or many of the innovations we enjoy today?

- They don't need to. There are many times more people who didn't even know what Bitcoin was then, or wanted to buy but couldn't get through the wait list for an exchange account - back in 2017 there was a huge bottleneck. And now it's way easier to purchase.
- You must mean people who "only" bought in Dec, 2017. Why the hell would you only buy once? And why the hell would you buy at 20k and not anywhere between 3.2k and now?? Smart people don't just buy one time, they buy at different price points, as you do with stocks.
- Why did people keep buying back when it was a only few dollars? A few hundred? A few thousand? There were bubbles then too, with just as great of a percentage of loss.
- Finally, people will fomo again, and again, and again, and again... because buying this time around to reach 50k or 100k, is the equivalent of buying last time to reach 20k.

@_date: 2019-09-27 11:06:54

Why not? It might drop even lower than you say and it might not even drop any more until after another little  pump. You cant possibly know when these large players organize these big sells and buys. If there's one thing they do well it's not giving any indication of when they will make their move. That much has been established.
@_date: 2018-07-13 19:46:32
Why?  It's the same price as it was last month. Sideways movement usually proceeds upward movement. In any case it seems to have leveled out somewhere between 5500 and 6500. 
Listen, and if you believe anything you read on here or wherever, please know this:
Bitcoin is NOT going away. There's a lot of shit I don't know, a lot. But I have an excellent understanding of how technology evolves and integrates with society. I am telling you right now .. Bitcoin is not going away. Anyone that says it is, well the real bubble is the one they're living in.

You're stuck in stock mode and comparing Bitcoin's value to a business model value. I get it, I really do. It's really difficult to nail how Bitcoin translates to value when it's a brand new monster. It can revolutionize how funds are exchanged gloabally and at the same time be traded on the market and eventually reach the potential of an exceptionally robust store of value as digital gold. It generates revenue for miners and hardware manufacturers. It's on it's way to becoming a massive industry of sorts, yet nobody knows how to value it. That's the truth of it. But just because I said it would be as sound to own as Amazon, doesn't mean it's evaluated in the same way. I mean, it's currency in itself. It could become a much bigger deal than most people envision.
@_date: 2018-07-17 11:20:56
Most people never even heard of Bitcoin until last year. Awareness is increasing and so is infrastructure. We are clearly following a typical hype cycle pattern...in fact it's almost exact. We are entering an upward phase next, and there's a hell of a lot of people out there who will be dipping their toes over the next few years.
@_date: 2018-07-27 16:44:09
My point is simple. Something this volatile is just not a good fit for TA. I have not seen much organic price movement in Bitcoin since December, and until organic movement returns to the space, TA will not serve much use.
@_date: 2018-07-24 15:15:44
That's what always happens in the initial stages of FOMO, but it applies only to people who have already invested in alts because for quite a while ..that's where the opportunity seemed to sit. Over the past week there was a temporary perspective of transferring existing alt investment into BTC, because it required no additional FIAT.
IMO, that phase is over and you'll start to see alts being dragged up right along with BTC again now. This whole market is one of balance, and unless you're trading daily, it won't affect you in the long term. BTC dominance is good for both Bitcoin and alts if you really think about it.
@_date: 2018-07-13 23:34:58

There is usually a large spike before a drop in thise scenarios but we have not had any pump that was a result of bakkt news so there's not likey to be a dump on launch. Since much of the large buys to play in the bakkt sandbox are expected to be over OTC, there won't likely be a price jump either.

There's  no real reason for bakkt launch to pump price, that takes time as bakkt onboards new users.

Ok so you disagree, got it. Many well respected and intelligent people have expressed their expectations on both sides of this, and it is not as simple as "oh look what happened in the post bubble days, we should avoid it like a plague". How you or I may disagree on the outcome is not relevant, I realize this, but my point is that many believe that regulatory clarity combined with a lower coin price point of entry may be an attractive scenario for many institutional investors. 
I still have no doubt that it will remain a high risk category, but there is demand for that. I've reviewed several proposed portfolio allocation charts. It's almost certain to happen eventually, but I am not so naive as to think this is going to occur tomorrow.

The biggest mistake people make is to evaluate the potential of any technology based ONLY on its current state. You can't imagine bitcoin in use with taxes and pension funds because you picture it as it is today. You imagine a volatile asset crashing and bubbling injecting chaos into the system. Why don't you consider what it is very likely to become? The developers are not slacking off - there are more of them and you must know they are going to continue improving the bitcoin blockchain.  We are in very early days here. So before you ridicule bitcoin, consider the incredible intellect of those involved with building it.

Very simple... if you guess right, you convince yourself you have an ability, if you guess wrong then you just say nothing. I get it, I really do. Before I lost big on investments during the 2008 recession I thought I was pretty decent at that stuff too. GL to you!

That's like asking what potential threat will military weapons in 20 years from now be to today's defences. Things evolve together, and Bitcoin, along with all other encryption based securities, will have to adjust accordingly. It's probably the last thing we should worry about at this point. Seems to keep getting online traffic and ad clicks for any media that publishes an article about it though.

Nope, and quantum computing is not near - it's actually a good ways down the road if you look into how far it has to go. It's no more of an issue to bitcoin than it would be an issue to banks, computer viruses, and encryption based security the world over. Future tech is not a problem because, well it's the future, and everything else evolves with it relatively.
@_date: 2018-07-27 10:06:25
As it should. If you read what the SEC said, it was actually positive. They said that they are NOT closing the door on an ETF for Bitcoin, but that this particular proposal did not meet their requirements. There's a good chance they will approve an ETF in the not so distant future. I was more worried about the Futures contract close to be honest, but it barely made a dent in the price considering it was 5700 just a little while ago. The market looks to be heading upward and we may see another aggressive bullish run up sooner than anticipated.

Excuse for what? Why would I be salty? You're not making a lot of sense. 9.2k is not what you said last week - I just found the notion of a big dump to 7k funny. But.....any time there is a big dump, I buy more because after all this time, there is 0 doubt that bitcoin is going away. The opportunity to buy bitcoin cheaper never lasts. This discussion was had at 1k, 2k, 3k, etc. If you cna buy bitcoin at 7k.....buy it.

Wow. It's almost difficult to believe that anyone could be as stubborn. You're an odd case, because from your comments you seem intelligent enough to consider alternative views.  But you stick like glue to your one dimensional view. I think the most bizarre part is that you just say the same thing in different words. You're not hearing us. Try to grasp one simple thing. IT'S TOO EARLY TO SAY IT FAILED. It's not Apple pay, or any of those systems built on existing platforms. It's an entirely new platform.
I could care less that you misunderstand, but anyone reading your comments will get a completely incorrect concept of how incredibly difficult things Lightning Network are to implement. If you're ignorant of how complex it is to add this layer on a new network model, and then tweak it under load, you should just stick to your silly comments of gloom and doom and how a crytpo ETF will bankrupt the country and all that to foolish tinfoil hat bullshit.
Seriously, some people just have to be called out on their crap. You'll be nowhere to be found on here in 3 years or so when bitcoin is an option at every online checkout right along side Visa, Debt, and PayPal etc. You're a victim of your own stubborn complacency to learn and expand your understanding. That's unfortunate.

I'm probably among the least paranoid of my IT colleagues. If you saw the things I've seen over the years, you'd probably feel the same! Your cold storage is safe of course, but announcing that you have a large amount of crypto can lead to very shady activity via your IP address, your phone, email etc. Imagine if BTC goes to 100k, and you have 19. Just sayin!
As for wishing I could have bought more, yes I often do, but people I know who bought bitcoin at 100 bucks and those who mined it, already felt like they made massive gains when it hit 1k, 2k, etc. So they never held it anyway and I'm guessing there are many others in that scenario.
@_date: 2018-07-02 01:04:08
I understand, but an interesting thing about technology is that we haven't thought of solutions that have not been created yet. This is way too early to assume LN or some later version of it won't deliver much more of what is needed.
Most people never heard of Bitcoin until last year. Look at all that has changed already. Regular crypto coverage in major News financial segments and the controversy over how to deal with this new hydrid entity should say enough. Imagine in 5 more years..
Of course the price of the coin was in a bubble phase last year, one of many in these early days of Bitcoin.
For all that gave it a go on the last run, there are many times more new people bound to make a modest investment to catch the next price swell and eventually it may level off and enter deeper into the store of value stage. 
Nobody knows for sure, but Bicoin will likely see far more days than us.
@_date: 2018-07-06 03:45:32
Theres been a dozen of these claims made, with attempts to look for a pattern in the numbers. There's also been a dozen arguments to refute them, based on the sheer volume of average Joe's that jumped in during the awareness stage of Bitcoin. There may have been some manipulation of price but based on the information available, the manipulation's role in the 20k run up may have been as a catalyst at most.
So what? All markets are manipulated on some level. During these early days the market needs to get all this out of the way and through regulations, it will most likely eventually find a Bitcoin price that is subject to less volatility. Its gonna take time though and more bubbles are very likely.
@_date: 2018-07-17 22:32:09
What happened to all the blow hard shorters who have been throwing shade at Bitcoin for last few weeks? They all just disappeared like magic since the price hit 7k. Guess they're licking their wounds.
Aside from the obvious benefits of seeing the price rally, it's almost benefit enough to finally have those narcissists finally shut up for a while lol.
@_date: 2018-07-12 02:15:32
How could you possibly expect any more acceptance than there already is. It just HAS to take longer, much longer. We don't even have an easy way for non technical people to purchase it yet. Early operating systems had no graphics, folders, mouse, nothing but code. Only geeks could even use them. Now everybody has GUI's on personal computer devices...several of them for each individual. Bitcoin is the one that will be always worth upgrading and improving. Even real estate purchases have been made, so imagine in 3 years, 5, 10. You have to admit you can see what's coming with mass adoption. It's extremely obvious.

Looks like a little pump happening. On another topic, many fail to realize the massive difference between cash settled CME futures and bakkt physically settled futures. Of course the cash settled futures had a much higher volume at their start, because their dealing with an already established currency. If you really think about it, bakkt is holding its volume quite well.

Ha ha that rumor came from a shady website that accepted crypto ages ago and has since been proven inaccurate.
In fact, less than 1% of all Bitcoin transactions have been used or even linked to any criminal activity. There was also a study published by the Foundation for Defense of Democracies that showed this along with other investigations into the use of crypto.
How can people still be saying this? You should not just hear some rumor and spread it on without verifying it.
@_date: 2018-07-28 04:26:23
Are you high? Most other tokens are concepts and those that actually function are too new and not tested under stress. Bitcoin has the longevity of a network that has proven stable under incredible stress and hack attempts. That's what creates a foundation you can build on. That initial period of nerwork stability holds more value than all the other shit coins and white papers combined. Think before you type.
@_date: 2019-09-03 22:35:12
Usually up to a week, give or take. You need to get a new account verified, and then you can purchase crypto. Yes, you will need to provide ID - passport, license, or proof of age card. You also need to provide your phone number as you first start to create your account. Completing all parts of the verification will open up full use of the account.

Not at all, it's actually not theoretical... well unless you fail to envision, assuming we continue to see computing power increase as it almost inevitably will, that mining equipment will be much more affordable.

Nobody ever has. Some are far worse than others of course. Tell tale sign someone is full of shit when they make a price call?

No question is naive DJ. In fact it's refreshing and admirable when people like yourself ask questions. You would not believe the comments that get posted on here from people trying to pretend they understand things like Bitcoin ETFs, 51% attacks etc, and they are clearly clueless but afraid to admit it.
So yes, miners continue to get paid transaction fees once all coins are mined. This is a very long ways in the future though, and evolving mining technology will likely address any discrepancy between cost of operation and earnings.

The dot com bubble shares far more with blockchain than it does with Bitcoin. Similar to the dot com era, many companies associated themselves with blockchain to get a quick value lift to lose it again later since the value was based on technology that was not actually implemented.
Bitcoin however, is more or less, money. Nothing carries more weight than money and Bitcoin's potential to be a reliable accounting system, currency, store of value is exceptional. It simply needs a few years like all tech for the value to be realized by the masses. The ironic thing here? It's that those who work in finances rarely embrace creativity and imagination... this is a statistical personality trait of most accountants. So it is actually those who work with 'money' and finances that are the last to envision what Bitcoin actually brings to the table.

Your thinking is locked inside of a box, limited by your understanding based only on characteristics of traditional currencies. The volatility in Bitcoin's price is an unavoidable part of the price discovery process as Bitcoin spreads and integrates with society. Any death spiral would have already happened by now after 10 years, and with all the money pumped into the growing infrastructure it's sure as hell not going to happen now.
@_date: 2019-09-24 20:27:37
Sorry it just sounds like you're reading from the TA handbook for beginners - the history of charting lol. The human movement you refer to was not manipulated. In low volume markets like Bitcoin, it only takes a few whales to drop big amounts then FOMO kicks in and others join the sell party. You can't do that in regular markets, so TA is slightly effective there.

Well, if you evaluate the potential of future Bitcoin prices based only the present "slump" as you called it, then you would be evaluating it only on its current coin price. That would be highly amateurish and lack forward thinking.
Also, what you said about them not wanting to touch Bitcoin in 2017 being the logic of why they would not touch it today.. that makes zero sense. Today it's a cheaper point if entry, Bitcoin has shown the enormous gains it has the potential to provide, and the infrastructure has multiplied by many many times.

Bitcoin will undoubtedly coexist with current currencies, but it's global and eliminated the need for a middleman.
It's not tied to any one country or region, and can make large transactions overseas far more efficient. There will be improvements to the network just as is with all tech, and perhaps one day it will replace many fiat currencies. That will require a generation of users that are comfortable managing their finances independently, but with the next generation  being raised in a digital culture, it may happen sooner than we anticipate.
@_date: 2018-07-13 00:51:09
They were businesses. You cant possibly compare Bitcoin to a business.

A hell of a lot of people paid taxes on crypto this year. Look it up.
You can exchange crypto for fiat on OTC exchanges, peer to peer exchanges, new app infrastructures, decentralized exchanges and more. These entities are growing in numbers at an accelerated pace. We're past the threat of government shutting it down, and again since it's global, every government of every country would have to shut it down. That's extremely unlikely.
@_date: 2018-07-17 01:45:56
Up to a month ago I may have agreed with you. But anyone that's been on this train for a 3 or 4 years knows that Bitcoin usually rebounds after ever drop, only to reach new highs. 
Now, the last month has been very different from the previous months since the initial push of the hype cycle kick start. Anyone shorting Bitcoin should probably be very on edge about now.

No, that was the limit of the current Bitcoin architecture. There's limits on current computing power too, but you asked under the premise of the computing technology adapting and advancing to accommodate a larger demand and solve much faster.

Why are so many people ignorant about investing habits? "Bag holders" is a fun term to throw around sure, but the reality is that most people holding bitcoin don't just buy it at the ath and then hold it after a drop waiting for it to return. They buy it at semi-regular intervals in small portions! So the tiny fraction purchased at 20k barely registers into the equation since it was only up that high for a blink in time. A true long term investor catches all price ranges and is rarely at a loss.

When you're trying to accumulate as much of something as you can for a long time down the road, you don't get upset with a lower price to acquire it :).

@_date: 2018-07-11 15:01:37
Oh OK, then maybe so but unless you have a large amount of disposable income to short BTC and try and time this unpredictable market, holding a modest amount for long term gain is the best way to remain unaffected by these day to day moves. Those big green candles have never occurred in a predictable manner. In fact, they usually occur when least expected because they are are not a result of volume, but rather big money that was bet against shorts. So ...basically manipulation lol.
@_date: 2018-07-13 19:44:57

ALL technology takes time, and personally I think Bitcoin is moving forward about as fast as possible considering the vast obstacles it has already overcome. Also of course, considering that this is currency we're dealing with here, and not just some site to post drunk pictures of your house party. This takes time. You're blaming FAR too much on the fees, when the reality is that the majority of the world simply need to slowly get on board over time, just like any other innovative tech. The fees, along with many other areas will be addressed with upgrading in due time.

Lol Bitcoin can not be accurately charted. You need trends for that, and all your data goes out the window as soon as a big red or green candle appears and makes the data useless. If it were that easy, the big boys would see it too (considering they have millions and can afford the best TA people put there) and NOT do the expected.

Well maybe history doesn't always repeat but it is undisputed as an excellent source of how patterns occur. As I mentioned, Bitcoin has crashed as much as 90% in the past, only to come back stronger... and that was before the enhanced infrastructure of today.
@_date: 2018-07-11 19:55:04
elaborate please
@_date: 2018-07-16 11:23:01
If you can afford to forget about it for a while, won't stress over it and won't be devastated in worst case scenarios, then focus on the fact that there's a lot of potential in the future of Bitcoin. Just learn to ignore pessimists and stick to what you can afford to lose. This is probably the best entry point you'll have, but nobody knows for sure.
@_date: 2018-07-10 14:14:32
Not quite. The good news has been coming from a wide variety of sources including a lot of bright and innovative thinkers. The problem here is that there seems to be a lack of understanding regarding the time frame. Technology like this will be adopted slowly over time and regulatory clarity is needed before more big enters the space. Most of the good news that's legit indicates a longer time span!
@_date: 2018-07-03 20:49:54
Sure. So could the internet, Space travel and many other things that completely overhaul the way things used to be done. I just highly doubt it.
@_date: 2018-07-06 03:18:02
If the use case you're referring to is as a currency, and it does have more use cases, then why would you think it failed just because it has not succeeded yet? There's just no way it could succeed as a currency of any real use until it becomes far more user friendly to exchange. Wallet address translation and layering, with easier storage, etc. That's what it needs, but why do you think it is not coming? It took the internet from the 60s   until the 90s just to get in homes. And this is money we're talking about now, that shit don't change easy.

You most likely lost him at "why mining is necessary". If you read back through his post history it's clear he's as immature as he is ignorant. He is quite persistent though with his trolling today, so I'm guessing either a paid troll (someone's not getting thier money's worth lol), or he got burned in a bitcoin investment.
@_date: 2019-09-25 13:33:50
I'm not "rich" from any of my investments, well not what I would call rich. I didn't realize becoming rich was a requirement. The bitcoin I've bought over the years is worth a lot more now than when I bought it though, so there's that.
@_date: 2018-07-24 16:49:31
He didn't buy at the top. He bought in the midst of all that momentum at 15k that shot it up to almost 20k. You don't go from 15k to 20k in 9 days without a hell of a lot of volume do you?
@_date: 2019-09-14 14:49:33
Bakkt is one of many projects in the works. Speculative trading over bakkt isn't likely going to move us out of this tight range, but ICE is not some ma and pop store - they don't mess around. Bakkt has the potential to bring in massive players, and if it takes off it could spiral into a big playing field where more and more deep pockets get involved in bakkt futures. This is how bakkt could really impact bitcoin price and it will take time as thier futures market matures. This whole "priced in" talk applies only to the speculation of proactive buying based on bakkt's potential. It's the actual buying of bitcoin to participate in bakkt futures that can really move the price going forward.
@_date: 2018-07-15 02:04:51
For the record, your arrogance is barely tolerable. If you communicate this way in a professional environment then you must eradicate any possibility of collaboration. My line of work involves a great deal of collaboration, exchange and contribution of new ideas so it's difficult to imagine a world that tolerates your attitude.
@_date: 2018-07-27 14:59:13
All you need to do is take 2 minutes. Look up all the dates of the last 6 months on Futures close. Now look at the Bitcoin price on those EXACT dates every time. Then tell me what you think.
@_date: 2018-07-06 02:52:00
I see your logic but the low 21 million limit on supply changes the game. Large companies like Amazon and Netflix have 100s of millions of shares. 
I agree, market manipulation is unavoidable... but with 21 million coins, only around 17 mil currently, if more money flows into the space on a large scale, the individual coin price could benefit.
@_date: 2018-07-14 15:12:49
Remember when it was $200? Its actually incredible how far Bitcoin has come in such a short time.
@_date: 2018-07-11 17:48:14
You're fairly accurate, but let's not be fickle over the details. Based on what you just said though, you MUST see the comparison to ICOs and not Bitcoin right?

When you state what is obviously an opinion as though it is a fact, you just look stupid.
@_date: 2019-09-04 20:00:03
The largest gains typically come after the halving. This is because miners, who then make half the bitcoin for the same efforts, hold their coins, reducing supply and contributing to a new ATH. Then once the price skyrockets they sell to take their profits, triggering a sell off, which results in the following drop as the cycle starts over again with higher highs and lows as supply continues to shrink. This time around though, there are a lot of different factors to consider such as institutional involvement, so the post ATH drop may not be nearly as severe.
@_date: 2018-07-27 01:31:16

@_date: 2018-07-06 18:28:47
You don't just comment negatively occasionally, you comment negatively consistently. Now it's your business to form your perspective based on the info you have. But why hang out in a Bitcoin forum where investors socialize and exchange info, if you simply just feel so negatively toward crypto? I've seen your comments and they are all gloom.
Clearly you're not going to invest in something you don't believe in, so what could you possibly gain from spending your time in this thread? Are you that bored?
@_date: 2018-07-10 17:24:55
Never invest money you need for anything else. PERIOD.
@_date: 2019-09-25 13:53:54
No, I can not answer the question. I would never talk about that and my advice to you, whether you think it's worthless or not, would be to do the same. If you really have 19 BTC though, which was recently worth over a quarter of a million, I'd suggest you not tell anyone on Reddit private chat or not. Are you aware of how risky that is with email, IP addresses, ISP, etc? Even if you don't have that much, it's not a good idea to say you do on an open public forum.
@_date: 2018-07-14 15:43:03
Ha ha, yeah something to be said for that whole process! I miss it too, except when the weather is crappy and I'm thankful for Netflix lol.
@_date: 2018-07-14 04:18:43
Dark activites lol. And nobody said it needs to replace anything. It need to provide an alternative that is well aligned with multiple types of transactions, without any global or total amount restrictions.
I don't anticipate your mind opening up much past what is currently in place. You need to remind yourself that many technologies we use today weren't even imagined when we were kids.

He he, funny guy. Nobody is calling for 8k. Some bearish TA calls have mentioned a possible brief dip to 9.2ish, but we all know that bitcoin TA is almost always wrong anyway. As for the triangle, it hasn't dropped below its bottom once since it formed. So let's be honest, there's nothing "accurate" about your prediction. The positive developments currently unfolding however, are very real and easy to see for anyone with an internet connection. There's Lolli's Crypto E-Commerce App, bakkt, 2 potential ETFs, the SEC publicly stating approval as being closer, a halving coming up and much more. So I'll go with saying you're full of shit, no disrespect:).
@_date: 2018-07-17 01:42:13
You post on here fairly regularly, and you seem like a stand up guy. I think the fact that you'd be willing to give that kind of value away to a good cause is admirable and kudos to you. To be honest, based on the way Bitcoin has taken off in the past few 3 or 4 years, I'd be surprised if it's not 100k within 5 years. 3 years might be a bit close but who really knows!!
@_date: 2018-07-16 17:15:32
Well it's crashed harder in the past and came back harder. It's in an exceptionally tight sync with a hype cycle pattern, and we're now entering into a much better phase.
@_date: 2019-09-13 15:12:07
In the US you pay capital gains on the amount in USD that the bitcoin has increased every time you transact the bitcoin for another crypto, product, or service. .... for now. 
If bitcoin continues to go viral at the pace it has been (and it almost certainly will), then the US and all countries will have to revisit this tax law soon. It would be absurd to expect everyone to account for every single transaction once we get to the point where each person is making hundreds of transactions in mass numbers of citizens.
@_date: 2019-09-07 01:53:35
You can gift up to a specific amount (way more than 2k so you're good). The person who converts bitcoin to another crypto, goods or services pays capital gains on the amount above 2k that it's worth during the time of transaction. In your example that person would be the recipient.
@_date: 2018-07-25 09:57:23
Don't worry about it. Not everyone can have common sense so don't beat yourself up over it. Just let that order sit there like an email to Mars that never gets answered. I'm sure there's other things that you can be good at so focus on that.

Not at all, in fact I enjoy all perspectives on topics I'm interested in. But this article is titled "why" something will happen. Then you read it, and it's just some guy saying he thinks Bitcoin is bad without any reason. He may as well have stuttered and drooled.
@_date: 2018-07-10 17:18:44
You cant reason with anyone that sees only the bubble and not the long term. Almost every mainstream innovative technology we use today began with bubbles. You will hear this from many nay sayers until crytpo is a mainstream alternative currency and value store. But by that time the ETFs will have already been readily available, legitifying crypto and providing a point of entry for many who are currently worried about their lack of technical comfort and the safety of storing crypto. 
I am very confident in the benefit that ETFs and the spin off crytpo investment vehicles will bring to the space. You really need to think long term though, WAY past the bubbles.
@_date: 2018-07-17 19:41:11
There's actually a compounding effect of positive news from multiple sources making a great impact. There's a very good chance that this run up may not have a reversal any time soon.

@_date: 2018-07-30 17:29:42
I'm all for positive Bitcoin movement, but if what you are saying was accurate then Bitcoin price would be increasing, but it's not, It's actually slightly down. If all the lost ALT $$ was flowing into Bitcoin it would be increasing the BTC price.
@_date: 2018-07-16 17:22:28
Volume is needed. Regardless of the multiple scenarios, negative or positive, volume is the answer. It's much more difficult to manipulate a quantity when your vested power is a percentage of an expanding total. The more that volume increases, the more that manipulation diminishes.
Bitcoin is moving almost exactly in a hype cycle pattern. If it continues to do so, then an organic increase in volume, enabled by increasing ease of entry is the next phase.
@_date: 2019-09-29 20:37:02
Absolutely. That's a class act thing to do man, kudos.
@_date: 2019-09-29 18:24:32
Lol then don't buy bitcoin. It's not like anyone here cares that you expected it to reach its full potential too quickly. This is maybe like dial up internet stage, and anyone following the progress even as a hobby can clearly see that technologies like this require full scale infrastructure and framework...that's years away man. If you are dissapointed it's because you had unrealistic expectations and a poor understanding of how technology integrates with society.
@_date: 2018-07-02 14:01:08

I know buddy, but if you step back it's just the most realistic example of what a correction is... it went up too much too fast and we're getting back to a more realistic movement. With the fast pace of infrastructure development in the crypto space, the next bull run will be much more solid. It'll happen, and with real investment and real world applications.
@_date: 2018-07-13 23:44:31
That's just you refusing to consider other possibilities outside what your brain has been exposed to. You do realize that if everyone thought that way, we'd have none of the innovations we enjoy today.
If a new generation that's been raised in a digital culture embrace Bitcoin, then it will be adopted. It's global and non centralized. I don't think it will replace the fiat system in all countries of the world any time soon, but it will almost certainly run along side as an alternative currency that is not tied to any one country or region.
I fully support  Bitcoin and see where it is headed, but as a network security specialist for years, I sometimes also see it as something that is possibly one of the most robust entities to ever come out of mankind's imagination. Think about what it has already survived... the negativity, and the paid studies from the BIS, all the crap thrown at it to beat it down over the years..yet it just keeps growing bigger and bigger (not the coin price, I mean the entity). One thing I know for sure...Bitcoin will outlive you and I.
@_date: 2018-07-28 04:21:53
You should stop man, you are just sounding dumb

That's not how Google Trends work. Just saying. Last year most people didn't even know what bitcoin was. Granted, it still has years to complete the natural evolution of a typical new technology, but the awareness phase peaked in December past. Most searches now are for specific news, exchanges etc.
@_date: 2019-09-27 17:01:54
I also have similar news to share: The Bitcoin CEO just released a report that they are merging with bullshit dot com because their carrier pigeons are being shot down and their private keys are being exposed. As you mentioned above, the Bitcoin technology will be purchased for pennies on the dollar, and the Bitcoin CEO (Mr. Chain Block) is fearful that his salary will be eradicated in a takeover. This merger will be good for no coiners and help feed trolls.
@_date: 2019-09-23 15:42:48
Holy crap, I checked bakkt volume earlier and it was at 28. I thought that was decent considering it just opened last night. Now a few hours later, it's at 51! If bakkt continues to pick up new participants at this rate, things are going to get very interesting.
@_date: 2019-09-29 14:26:41
What do you mean by mining that takes years? A block is mined every 10 minutes, and this is controlled by code in bitcoin. As hash rate increases, so does the mining difficulty, maintaining the ten minute block time. This is one of the many things that makes bitcoin innovation such an impressive technology.
@_date: 2018-07-02 00:36:10
You don't think the Bitcoin network and its software doesn't require hundreds of hours of skilled programming? As the software to improve Bitcoin is being upgraded there is an ongoing contribution of code added to the open source process. This code is reviewed and tested, and so forth. 
In this digital age it's surprising that there are still so many people that have not yet adapted to the concept of technology and today's digital value. The properties to work efficiently as a digital currency and store of value and the public acceptance are not advanced quite enough yet for many to envision where this is headed. 
But it's time to stop the "no value" claims. Think for a second about some of the things we place value on. Now think about the coders, miners, hardware and software that will be created to improve mining, the jobs it will create, the traders and investors, the infrastructure, how it's impacting countries all over the world, our financial news, and I could go on. 
Now ask yourelf again, compared to some of the ridiculous things we 'value' in the world of commerce, is it fair to say Bitcoin has no value?
@_date: 2018-07-14 04:03:45
We'll see. I'm not going to explain why 8 years is not only new, but in an infancy stage kind of new. There was no existing and working concept of Bitcoin to build on, it's the first one.
All this crypto ecosystem is new really. It's very easy to forget that.
@_date: 2019-09-24 10:22:06
Naw, sorry if you're shorting and you're trying to convince yourself but you must know that's unlikely. But even though there's no sell pressure there's not a lot of buy pressure either, so the most likely scenario is more sideways and slowly up as people accumulate... at least for the next while.
@_date: 2019-09-16 18:21:30
Exactly. So many people have no clue just how new all of this still is. I mean a year or 2 is a drop of time, and things like this take generations to go mainstream. We're barely in the internet dial up days.
@_date: 2019-09-29 14:20:33
The mining difficulty increases proportionally, as does all things in the tech world. When the time comes the bitcoin algorithm itself will also be upgraded with an agreed upon hard fork in the open source community. You're example is correct, but as I'm sure you've noticed, the storage space required today has increased along with the capacity to store.
@_date: 2018-07-14 06:09:44
Sure! ..First of all, a 51% attack is 'possible' but not probable. You can't take anyone's money using a 51% attack, you can only spend your own. Plus it only takes one miner to refuse to accept any block that seems malicious.
As for the protocol, you won't find this on your news sources, it's from the Bitcoin Core Developers. Matt Corallo has proposed BetterHash to replace Statum, the current protocol. Instead of allowing the mining pool to decide who gets the work, the miners can pick and create their own blocks. There's a lot of technical details to this, and I'm not sure if you're serious or trolling. So honestly I am not sure you'd understand this ...not an insult, most people don't.
@_date: 2019-09-23 15:44:58
Lol, so I'll never be asking.
@_date: 2019-09-24 01:29:31

@_date: 2019-09-13 11:00:01
If it is successful, and a growing number of people buy bitcoin to participate in bakkt futures, then yes of course it will move price. But it will take time to grow like any new business venture.
@_date: 2019-09-23 19:05:22
It's been explained for a long time now that bakkt will use their warehouse to store and deliver/settle, but institutions can use their own bitcoin, which they will likely acquire via OTC... for now anyway. If this things ramps up over time, then it can easily affect price, but I personally I see no major price change for a long time yet. My sights are set for after the halving.
@_date: 2018-07-05 20:19:57
@_date: 2019-09-03 03:40:08
Well, not enough people are using it to pay for things. I think most of us who buy bitcoin believe that going forward more and more people will be choosing to store value in bitcoin and paticipating in trading it. So we hold on to it as it increases in value. There's not enough demand for currency use yet.
@_date: 2019-09-04 18:12:02
You're gone way out there. My life, like many others I'm sure, has many moving parts. Bitcoin and this sub are a very tiny portion. Yes, I think bitcoin will play an enormous role in the future economy, but currently it's just one of my investments and I don't overthink it. You are taking this whole thing way further than you need to. These are just comments in one reddit sub.
@_date: 2018-07-24 15:26:52
We can't and don't know. But the reality is, the time that leads to the next big bull run could be the third..or the fourth ..or the seventh ...nobody knows. We do know though, that this recovery was lead by a longer period of sideways movement, and is complimented by the highest BTC dominance and wave after wave of positive news and developments, including serious consideration of an ETF. So, this run has a very strong chance to be the one.
@_date: 2018-07-17 18:16:33
"there will be more months of desperation in the future"

Well there many times more infrastructure, mining equipment, apps, peer to peer platforms, exchanges, OTCs, SEC attention, global job creation, and more than there has ever been since the birth of Bitcoin. 
So to assume the coin price will continue to rise year over year as it has been doing, even before all this recent development, would not be a stretch. Once crytpo ownership requires a less technical point of entry process, things will rapidly evolve.
@_date: 2018-07-18 23:20:50

Tell them that NOTHING goes straight up. A few dips here and there mean nothing. It will bubble up and dip many many times in the next few years, but knowing where it's headed is the only thing anyone should really be made aware of... in case they live under a rock and didn't already know. The fact that it is extremely likely that for a significant portion of lifetime for anyone under 60, Bitcoin will be be worth a small fortune. Knowing that is reason enough to own at least a little.

I think the market movers, who typically trigger fomo, are standing by. There are a lot of things soon to unfold including bakkt, regulatory clarity, and even 2 ETFs that could be approved in the near future. Just recently, the SEC publicly stated that YES, they are much closer to approving an ETF. Then you have uncertain times within global economies, coupled with decreasing interest rates and much talk of an inevitable recession. There could be a perfect storm on the works that could see bitcoin price 10X... or it could simply sit in this range for the rest of the year. Either way, lots of potential and  exciting times ahead!
@_date: 2018-07-03 20:46:55
I know you can't mean that. This sub does not account for even 1% of Bitcoin investment.

In serious trouble how? There's more infrastructure, mining software, SEC acknowledgment, peer to peer exchanges, etc, then ever before. The open source community for Bitcoin is stronger than ever, and the Lightning Network is the beginning of much more layering and improvements coming down the pipe. There have been well respected business people claiming Bitcoin will be a excellent for real estate transactions among many applications. We don't even have wallet address translation yet and non technical people have user friendly platform to onboarding but it's clearly coming. 
Focusing only in the coin price is silly, but there's the fact that Bitcoin jas crashed like this many many times, in fact it's crashed worse at a 90% drop once. We are in early days, but I do understand that a quick look at the outside view of this would lead one to feel pessimistic. Just remember, in the early days of cars, the speed limit was only 20 mph, because they didn't want to spook the horses.

Just because this is your first year, don't assume that there none of us that don't know the difference. The huge run up in December created massive gains for a lot of people who are profit taking. This can happen many times until Bitcoin becomes more than just a coin to trade in the market. Recent infrastructure has been underway on a bigger scale these last few years. It won't be much longer before Bitcoin becomes much more useful than it currently is, and this pump and dump scenarios will fade into the past.
@_date: 2018-07-08 05:15:48
You have such conviction in your own theory, that you state the potential scenario of your theory as fact ...though thousands of brilliant people all over the world have been wrong about the future of many issues. You're also so caught up in the weeds you are not seeing the rest of the field. 
An ETF provides a multitude of investors with an entry point into crypto that doesn't require technical savvy. It removes the risk and the worry of buying it, storing and securing it. The first step to Bitcoin growth, whether it be as an investment or as a currency, is removing the obstacle of technical confidence required to obtain it.
I've only invested modestly, but have been following this shit for years. The snowball effect of ETFs, and the statement of Bitcoin legitimacy it makes, could very easily ramp up the volume in a short time. All these details you are talk about in terms of how ETFs enable manipulation will be mute. The ability to manipulate diminishes with every increase in the number of players in the game.
Look at the whole playing board, not just the rules of one single square.
@_date: 2018-07-14 16:22:07
Please. You have never said a single positive thing about Bitcoin and you consistently turn every potentially positive turn of events into a conspiracy and gloom.
It's clear that you gather up what you farm from random news articles and try to put it into context on here but it shows. 
You never heard of a protocol and then a comment later, you proceed to explain why it can't be effective?? Come on man, you know that reeks of bullshit.
@_date: 2019-09-22 13:31:17
Are you high? Any of us that have been here since days of much lower prices have not been holding because of bakkt you fool. And why would anyone who understands what bakkt is expect there to be a price increase on the day it launches? If it takes off then sure, it will be one more reason for an increase in bitcoin purchases. At first though, I'd expect the big boys to be buying OTC for sure. 
Bitcoin is still new, and the sooner you get through your head that there are still years and years of advancement left, the sooner you'll understand that you don't need to sell before the bulls, or whatever the hell you're talking about, to make money. Because anyone that's held for even a measly 4 or 5 years are already way up in the green. And that was when bitcoin was harder to acquire. You think that's all going to just stop now? Really? 
People have been saying exactly what you're saying for years and you're as wrong as they were. Bakkt is just a sign of the times. No serious hodler gaf whether the price dips or jumps tomorrow or any other single day. This is a long game and we're still in the early dial up days of internet, or Amazon in 2003 by comparison.
@_date: 2019-09-11 17:29:44
Much respect
@_date: 2019-09-24 22:19:12
Honestly? If bitcoin goes to 3k or 20k, I have no plans to sell it until several years from now. I have been DCAing regularly so I don't find any one price gets me stressed out. I see constant addition to things being built around bitcoin and because I feel confident that the price will be many multiple times what it is now, a drop in price only means more bitcoin for my money when I buy. I fully expect drops, they have been a constant part of this journey.
@_date: 2019-09-17 20:26:32
In a generation or 2. Bitcoin has only been around for a decade. Anyone that expects anything more than what it has already accomplished is crazy. These are like the dial up days of the internet... the early dial up :).

You own this runup?
@_date: 2019-09-24 01:05:58
I've held through worse. The timing involved in the strategy you describe involves as much chance of having to buy it back higher as it does lower. Holding with DCA on the down curves has never failed. Sure man, if you care about having to hold at a loss for a while, roll the dice... but you just DCA your way out of that hole very easily by holding and accumulating.
@_date: 2019-09-24 01:24:45
Just DCA and hodl. Bitcoin's not going away.
@_date: 2018-07-06 03:09:50
One can support crypto and not hate banks lol. Crypto offers a lot of potential as an alternative currency.
The futures opened up a door that can  not be closed, and ETFs are no surprise. The additional money pumped into the space, however could still stimulate this whole market if there's enough of it. 
@_date: 2018-07-16 17:34:22
I'm pretty sure most people know what shorting is, and to be fair, you need to be playing with a significant amount of money to make any real gains (unless you're happy making 50 bucks here and there). 
The question is, what happens when that one catalyst occurs. That one event or release of information that hits public sentiment with a hammer and reverses everything to bullish. Because this is a very potential reality in this market, even if it results in another bubble that gets deflated once again in 6 months. 
You can't possibly believe that you'll get a heads up or some tip that it's coming.. because that's how it works.
@_date: 2018-04-14 17:12:55
How high do you think Bitcoin will get before people start trading it heavy for alts and another alt season begins?
@_date: 2018-07-06 22:02:50
After years I couldn't possibly tell you what Bitcoin will be worth a year from now but I'd defintiely say that based on escalating infrastructure and improvement, it will continue to be more. So what magical information source would you have to think you have credibility to advise someone not to invest in a rising technology?
@_date: 2018-07-17 11:24:57
Actually there's been far more good news than bad as of lately, and people getting angry are just the same old people who resist change, fear change, or like to complain and call everything a bubble or a scam etc etc. The truth? Most people in the world at this point don't really care. But that's exactly how new technology integrates with society and we're in for a lot of growth in the next 3-10 years.
@_date: 2018-07-27 00:56:25
This is such a boxed up way of thinking. That's like saying placing the heads of their enemies on display would do nothing for morale of the people because of the how bad they would smell, and how much work is involved in clean up later lol.
It's NOT about the initial mechanics of the stupid ETF!!! It's about the confidence it would instill in potential investors on the fence. It's the spinoff effect that everyone is stoked about, the millions and millions of dollars that would flow into the space. Why do you think Bitcoin can jump 3k on a "potential" ETF?
@_date: 2019-09-24 13:34:22
I'd hate to see how you though it looked in 2014-2015, or even this past December. It actually looks better than ever imo. Price may fluctuate of course, but that's just business as usual.

Now you're catching on. The internet was somewhat private in the 60s, as a category, but it still required massive upgrades. That took a long time regardless, because no mainstream public adoption is possible without ease of use. Perhaps you think Bitcoin is easy to use, but for the general public  it is not. For example, Wallet address translation will enable a transparent solution to start. I worked on early networks and many of my peers, including a few that have been mining and trading Bitcoin for years, see unbelieveable similarities here. But hey, it's ok to disagree. You'll hopefully retain your health and easily live long enough to see it yourself. My only input is if you want to own Bitcoin, it will cost you a hell of a lot more then. Let's watch it unfold and discuss it in 5 years.
By the way, if you really believe Bitcoin has been around since the 90's, somebody lied to you.
@_date: 2019-09-14 18:18:59
Yeah very possible. It's just that if bakkt really takes off, its user base will grow over the months and years and its impact on bitcoin price will grow with it....along with many other developments in this space.

You and that clueless JW4984 guy should start a website about all the idiotic things you have both said on reddit. You both suffer from the same thing: Your need to always be right has gotten in the way of your need to learn more so you can actually be right.
@_date: 2018-07-17 16:38:34
Bitcoin is following the hype cycle move for more...much like all innovative tech has in the past. Looks like we're heading into the "slope of enlightenment" and we could be looking at upwards price movement and gradually increasing adoption over the next months and years.
If Bitcoin continues on this path, I hope everyone accumulated while we had the dips!!
@_date: 2018-07-12 23:16:24
For years it's been this way. The price drops and all these obnoxious 'know-it-alls' come out if the wood work to compensate for their sorry lives, and get some pathetic pleasure out of telling crypto investors the whole "I told you so" verbal diarrhea.
Then when Bitcoin runs back up to a new ath they magically disappear. But then they always come back again just to be grasp a tiny bit of artificial credibility when the price is dropping to pretend they have some greater sense of financial understanding than the rest of us. 
They call crypto investors naive, greater fools and spew out the usual insults (because they lack the creativity to come up with anything new). It seems pretty obvious that they are the much greater fools.
@_date: 2018-07-27 15:52:34
It's neither good nor bad. It's just another tiny cog in a very big wheel.
@_date: 2018-07-17 11:46:33
It takes a long time. Most people adopt the use of technology without ever really understanding how it works, they just need incentives. For now, the main incentive is the fact that it may very likely go much higher in price again. There are small use cases as well, along with serious efforts being made to increase the ease of entry for institutional money. Realistically we should be headed upward for a good run. Maybe not explosive like the initial hype phases but who needs that anyway. Too much too soon is unsustainable.
@_date: 2018-07-13 20:34:33
It was much easier to use a horse and buggy before paved roads and highway infrastructure to accommodate cars at high speed transportation too. Give it time. The internet took 40 years to go mainstream and another 20 to accommodate bandwidth for today's many applications. Crytpo roots already run too deep for it to go away, and realistically, it can't be any further adopted than it is at this point in time.
@_date: 2018-07-14 04:29:08
Ever see the 8 year old concept of the internet? How about the 8 year old concept of the airplane? car? 3D Printing is still evolving, it generates a buzz every 4-5 years and just fades out of mainstream media over and over. It's still NEW. How about the cell phone after 8 years? Could you do banking on cell phones only 8 years after they were conceived? THINK before you type. It's not 8 year old tech, it's an 8 year old concept. The tech (hardware and software of the network) is being upgraded all the time, and will continue to ongoing. Get it now? It's the network that organically upgrades because the mining rigs and code will be upgraded for the remainder of its existence ... whether that's 1 month or 1000 years.
@_date: 2018-07-06 00:35:13
Yes. I have no info on why though.
@_date: 2018-07-27 03:40:12
You're drastically underestimating the impact that a much higher volume of moderate investments will have on the diminishing percentage held by who those you are referring to as whales.
Your prediction is based upon the current allocation of investments. It's the shift in that allocation that people refer to when they say that adoption will increase the value. Bitcoin is pretty much as volatile as it should be during this extremely early stage. Its value is being determined as its uses are being experimented with in a small niche environment. It's growing, evolving and thriving. All you need to do is look at how the entity itself has already changed in this past 10 years. Now continue the story for another 10 years. It's continued growth is near inevitable as a global entity of currency and value store that simply can not be stopped any more than torrent file sharing can be stopped. Just keep a realistic timeline in mind.
@_date: 2019-09-09 16:58:27

You actually sound like you believe that crap. That makes you no more credible than the crazies calling for 100k by July... anyone who thinks they can predict price is usually full of shit. If you're right I get cheap bitcoin, if you're wrong, I get a lift on the bitcoin I already bought. So either way wins imo. DCA...everything else is noise.
@_date: 2019-05-02 21:36:46
Bitcoin's best use case in short term is store of value. It has all the makings of digital gold,  plus it is far more divisible, transferable, and accountable. We know how much is out there, and it requires energy to mine. That's where the near future will see bitcoin in my opinion.
@_date: 2019-05-30 16:37:19
Fiat can't possibly hold up to the versatility of bitcoin as we move toward the future. Calling out its downfalls now is not rational. Unless there is a catastrophic failure in bitcoin, which I highly doubt, it will continue to grow and evolve for generations to come. Today's shortcomings are typical of any tech in its early years.
@_date: 2019-05-07 21:06:32
That'll probably happen after bitcoin goes for a run, not before.
@_date: 2019-05-13 23:00:07
Regardless of short term, never forget that only a very tiny parentage of people who could potentially buy bitcoin have actually entered this space yet. This recent kind of price action should be a reminder to all of just how massive this thing can go over the next 5-10 years. The past decade has only been test runs.
@_date: 2019-05-30 20:28:41
They'd have to be awfully new, since this has been the way bitcoin has moved for ages.

@_date: 2019-05-21 01:38:24
Bitcoin seems likely to have more sucess as an alternative store of value first. It has so much potential as an alternative to gold. With so many people trickling into the space, and so many more to come, it's positioned to continue rising in value for years. This encourages holding. By the time it saturates the mass public and the price rises level off, the infrastructure will likely be in place to enable mainstream currency use in transactions. Bitcoin has massive potential to do it all eventually.
@_date: 2019-05-30 16:06:18
Congrats to all who bought the bottom. To those who are new, keep in mind that whether it be institutional, individual, whatever, more and more people are wanting to own some bitcoin. And there's no logical reason why this will not continue for years to come. If you think it's too late, it's not. This is still VERY early and there's plenty of room for massive profits.
@_date: 2019-05-15 16:21:29
We're not quite there but improvements are in constant development. It takes time to build this new infrastructure. This is a good thing, because once we are there, far more people will own bitcoin, and the majority of the investment opportunity will be gone.
@_date: 2019-05-01 12:27:52
It did? Can you prove that? I mean really show how that 26% is allocated and how you feel that tether would have inflated the price of BTC? Maybe certain alts? Because other than once in 2017,  the printing of tether has never coincided with an increase in bitcoin price. I'd love to hear how you can make that statement as though it's fact and not just bullshit from a slew of clickbait articles that profit from gullible website traffic.
@_date: 2019-05-11 12:46:10

This has been said about every price increase since the bottom this past December. What amazes me is not the naivety of the comment, but how people state it with such certainty only to be wrong over and over.

Yep, and it's barely even started. Many people don't understand that this has already been set in motion.
@_date: 2019-05-04 15:36:10
Yeah, it's looking solid. The profit taking has only been resulting in small pull backs, not like the barts we were seeing before. We keep climbing with 2 steps forwards one step back. This is what we need. People just need to understand that nothing in history ever just moves straight up without dips.
@_date: 2019-05-11 06:36:52
Depends on the alt coins. Eth is getting a load of positive developments, and a few others are in trials with major players. Bitcoin is the king and will likely see the highest gains for the next while, but some alts will fare well.
@_date: 2019-05-30 12:12:41
So in other words, buy bitcoin now before that happens. Because it's once it happens the opportunity to make huge gains will be far smaller. And a quick look at the past decade shows pretty clearly that it is becoming easier and easier to purchase and store. Once store of value is mass adopted, currency use would be the next logical phase to occur.

I could ramble on about stacked developments in the space, value store fundamentals being acknowledged by big entities, moving averages crossing (like an hour ago), but nobody got time for that. 
All I can say is there have never been any guarantees in this space, but I've never seen it look more promising than it does now.

That seems to be debatable. If Tether can cover the 26% with investments and additional reserves that are not as liquid then they should be fine. Commercial banks only keep a small fraction of customers money on hand in cash form, usually less than 10%! So Tether holding 74% should not be heavily criticized when held against the standard of the banking system that is the reality in which we live. To condemn Tether for holding 74% would be ridiculous and hypocritical.

You're worried that tether may be taken out? Don't. It's a very big, very successful business. It's like an analyst I was listening to in a podcast earlier said, "There are only two kinds of people that are claiming that tether will collapse: those who were in crypto and got burned, and stupid people". Tether has zero impact on me and Ive been in this space a long time. So I'm pretty sure I'm not the only one who feels this way. When I buy bitcoin, I get bitcoin. When I've sold in the past I got fiat. I'm not wasting my energy whining about tether, but I can spot when people try to use the tether story to scare others from crypto or get web traffic to their crap articles. And that's way more annoying than tether not having cash for the 26%. Long as they can cover it with other reserves if it was required, who cares??!

Of course not. How do you replace or supplement a current version of money if you don't first become exchangeable with that version of money for a few generations? That's kind of the whole point of how money works. If you valued everything in silver pieces or shells, then the next generation of currency would obviously have to begin in its infancy by being valued in silver pieces or shells.
So ironic is the last thing I would call that. Common sense and obvious is the first thing I would call that. Also added to this equation is the fact that Bitcoin is destined to be accepted worldwide, to accommodate a connected, digital world with one globally accepted currency. It will need to rely on FIAT all around the world for generations as it continues on its current growth path.

Does anyone remember the interview with the wallstreet guy about a month ago where they were talking about institutional investment in Bitcoin? He said that if Bitcoin ever drops to $3500 it would be in a sweet spot where he and several others he knew would buy the hell out if it. They talked about several reasons why he felt that was the right entry point and I'd like to go back and watch it again if anyone has a link.
@_date: 2018-12-06 14:27:59
Ha who knows! Or if anything like that, it would be more likely that he is affiliated in some way with the group that used that pseudonym to name an author of the project.
@_date: 2018-12-03 20:26:17
That actually explains it quite well. The BIGGEST point missed by most trolls on here is simple: They think last year's bubble saturated the market, when the reality is, it was far too complicated and intimidating for about 85% of potential investors to even touch. I can't count how many people expressed last year that they'd have totally bought in had they felt comfortable with the getting verified on exchanges, cold storage, wallet addresses etc. Already in just a short year, Bitcoin is far easier to purchase, and with new apps, exchanges and proposed investment products coming down the pipe, it's only going to get easier. We have not come CLOSE to the level of market saturation that we can reach with Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-12-07 20:05:11
Trolls are a natural part of the Reddit ecosystem unfortunately man. It's fun to debate them but it's always 100% pointless. What is there to gain, if their only goal is to troll then they can change their stance all day long and still fulfill their purpose. They have no personal interest in Bitcoin, only in trying to bait those that do. They have always been here, and they have always been wrong for years. That should be satisfying enough for you :).

You should look up the definition of ballistic.
You are wrong, if someone created multiple (and I mean 10+) accounts to shill bitcoin and spammed all day that the price was going to 50k, I'm sure many of us would request they also be banned. Nobody tries that hard to create the illusion that multiple users are saying the same thing without malicious intent. Come on, I know we all have different opinions on bitcoin, but creating a dozen account to spam the sub is cause to be banned. I think that's reasonable.
@_date: 2018-12-18 02:59:52
Naw, you can go home and start your own version of Amazon, Microsoft, Apple, Wallmart, etc, but just because you copied the plan does not mean anyone will want to do business with you. It doesn't mean you'll have the partnerships and clients, etc. The whole fork theory of diluting supply is only a concern of those who do not fully understand what brings value to Bitcoin. That's why you hear a lot of people saying it has no value. They think value must be resemble a service or product and need to stretch the neurons a little more to grasp network value.

Anyone that was into bitcoin during Mt. Gox days are hard core and they know where bitcoin came from and where it is headed. We know better than to make assessments based only on this past year of bear market price declines. If anything, those individuals are still invested one way or another, especially considering how far things have come with exchanges, layers, sidechains and trading. If the price is still this low when they receive payment, it's a high probability that they'll use the money to further accumulate at an attractive entry point.

Considering how computing technology evolves, it would be reasonable to assume that tech that utilizes computing would evolve along with it. By the time quantum computers are mainstream, things like security and encryption will be enhanced. Basically, encryption would benefit from quantum computing, not be threatened by it. 
If quantum computers magically appeared out of nowhere without the years required for them to evolve, and then went online, well yes that would be a threat. But we could say that about any future tech taken back to a previous time in history. For example, If we could go back to WW1 with today's stealth fighters and war machines, we'd wipe out the enemy forces with ease. 
Bitcoin is already near impossible to hack due to the high level of encryption and blockchain redundancy. Imagine how incredibly secure it would be if bitcoin becomes forked to update the algorithm, and the bitcoin network is secured and run across quantum miners. Quantum computer development would be the opposite of a threat to encryption in my opinion. It would be an incredible upgrade.
@_date: 2018-12-17 02:35:43
Well to be fair I have worked in IT and network security for a very long time. I feel I have a good idea of how long it takes to integrate a new tech, but that isn't the issue here. What we're talking about is currency, and not a new payment platform for an existing currency. This means multiple generations at the very minimum. We are programmed to use fiat from a very early age. It's even how many children learn to count and manipulate numbers. Currency is something that is embedded into the very fabric of society and to think we can reshape it in 10 years is radical and irrational. It will take many years, as new generations become familiar with a new concept of currency at an early age. Even economists, as intelligent as they are, are programmed over years and their entire career to view money within the concept of fiat. Bitcoin does not align with their foundation of currency values and infrastructure. The economists of the future will see things differently.

By that logic, at the rate Bitcoin was going up last December, it should have hit 30k even fast than predicted. Except it never, because that's not how things work in markets. There tops and there are bottoms. They are connected to fatigue of buying and selling. It would be foolish to think Bitcoin could have kept going up forever, and just as foolish to think it can keep going down forever. People like investing when the prices are beat up and selling when they are high. It's basic market psyscology.

Are you still here trying to scare the children with your tether campfire stories? People bought bitcoin since the 3200 bottom and some of them are large players who bought a lot. Is it so irrational to people that they dump a big load to take profits? It's not exactly a new development since it's been happening for years. They never took my USD because I never sold my $3200 coins. And in a week when it's back up over 8k it will not affect me in the least, other than I just grabbed a discount on bitcoin. I'd also bet I'm not alone on that stance.

Ok, well Cash App for apps, but honestly Coinbase for US is probably the best choice. They also have an app of course and if you're looking to purchase a wide variety of alt coins, then just buy Bitcoin or Eth from Coinbase, send it to Binance and then exchange for the alt coins of your choice. Binance is the best choice for alts and you can't buy them directly with USD, which is why you need to purchase them with BTC or ETH. It might seem confusing at first but once you do it a few times it will make a lot more sense!

I think you're missing my point but that's the thing about differing opinions and perspectives I suppose. You convert USD to YEN, but that value must always exist in one of those states, constantly tied to a specific region. Enter Bitcoin, a new state of money that is not tied to any region and you can leave as much of your wealth in this state for as long as you wish. That characteristic adds an entire new layer to the concept of currency. A new type of existence for wealth on a new infrastructure that opens endless doors. This especially benefits digital purchases made online where the seller and the buyer interact seamlessly with an ecosystem that does not recognize geographic boundaries. I can go on a long time regarding the multitide of advantages this  brings and there are far more that will be discovered along the way.

I realize you think you have it all figured out, and all the other people who believe the fixed supply adds accounting accuracy are wrong, but accepting that many others are every bit as intelligent as you are, and some more, will serve you well. Stating your opinion as fact instantly degrades the credibility of your input. Collaboration between varying opinions is where success is birthed. The divisible units of fixed supply allow bitcoin to scale well into the distant future, and knowing the supply would actually eliminate volatility once that supply is mass distributed. Once again, you're thinking is premature. Existing currencies took hundreds, if not thousands of years to mature.

Bitcoin has the potential to be an EXCEPTIONAL store of value. It aligns with future digital society. If you think future generations will continue to dig shiny rocks out of the ground, just to stick them in a dark vault and buy ownership of them when they'll never see them, then you are not on the right side of evolution. Bitcoin is in it's extreme infancy stage. When gold was chosen as a store of value, it was a different era. Open your mind. 
@_date: 2018-12-04 20:07:12
The greater fool theory is getting kind of overused don't you think? It's been applied to real estate, stocks, crypto and basically anything that people have over evaluated. The whole concept is irrelevant because it's become the foundation for any investment that's over valued and these days, and that covers a hell of a lot of ground. Bitcoin will hold a value proportionate to the amount of value people choose to store on its blockchain.
If the number of people injecting money into bitcoin continues to increase at a pace similar to the past decade, then in another decade it will be worth far more, based on a fixed supply. It's like a bank account - it's just a placeholder and for that reason many like to argue it has no intrinsic value . Well sooner or later people will start to understand that the value lies in the potential of the accounting efficiency, and not in the actual bitcoin. It's difficult for people constrained within the mindset of traditional stocks to grasp this concept of a hybrid entity, but I think we've come a long way in a short ten years.

Not one well presented argument came from you. Get real troll.
@_date: 2018-12-04 23:34:25
No, you'll still need to try again. You're trying to use your traditional understanding of stocks and real estate to establish value on a new hybrid entity. Bitcoin is not a product. It's not a share of any company. It's not real estate. There is no owner, and no marketing department. It's a global accounting system, self maintained by it's mechanics of participants, security of math, and redundancy &amp; decentralization of the blockchain.
It's a placeholder, just like any other placeholder  in the history of currency. If people choose to store their value in this new currency then it will scale in value accordingly. After only 10 short years it's come from a tiny project and valued by participants at only pennies to being sold for thousands. As a society we're still in the early stages of discovering what the value will be, but we have generations to go. As long as people hold your perspective and try to value it like real estate or a car, then we have a ways to go.
@_date: 2018-12-05 23:29:12

Naw, Bitcoin is up over the years, with gains that are magnitudes better than any other investment out there. Certainly better than Vegas lol. It's a long game but if you play with money you don't need or mind losing it's loads of fun! Nobody forces anyone to participate and that's the main factor here.. too many people in this sub are posting as if it bothers them that other people they don't even know are willing to risk their money. If it goes a few years and stops gaining me money then perhaps I'll remove the crypto market from my portfolio, but so far it's been bull, bear, bull, bear and up up up for years. You do you and I'll do me and we're all happy:)
@_date: 2018-12-21 05:54:42
I am extremely versed in the history of the internet, it's kind of what I've been immersed in for many years of my career. Many technologies we enjoy today began in government, fast food and porn. It's not because of the intention that you seem to naively perceive. It's a simple matter of resources, demand and supply. If something has potential, it will eventually make its way to the masses, regardless of the initial purpose it was conceived to fulfill. Bitcoin began as a very small project, perhaps as far removed from government as possible. That's the difference - the origins of the internet, for example, were not disguised or hidden. I wouldn't dismiss your theory so quickly if you were to present it as a theory. But whenever anyone presents their perspective as a fact, there's a very high probability that they are full of shit. The smartest people I have ever known were aware of how much they still didn't know.
@_date: 2018-12-05 17:41:13
Only attention seekers predict prices, so whoever you're talking to about being wrong, I doubt they are listening. The only thing I've seen from you was talk about Bitcoin not capable of being used as a currency, which if you think has anything to do with last year's bull market or this year's bear market simply proves that you are trying to connect the wrong dots.
@_date: 2018-12-05 21:59:17
Yeah, it's been a rollercoaster for sure. Typically the tail end if the bull markets move fast and the biggest issue is getting in and being in before it hits. Liquidation was not fun either and good luck cashing out before a lot of people realized it topped. I'm thinking now that exchanges have ramped up their infrastructure, the bottlenecks won't be as bad for the next one. But the higher the price, the higher the FOMO, so it will be interesting to see how they hold up to the volume this time.
@_date: 2018-12-06 19:16:21
I rest my case. 
@_date: 2018-12-01 17:21:16
There's no way to know for sure but the S&amp;P doesn't look promising for the short term to come, so I assume that's why you're bringing that up? I guess one would have to look at previous down turns in the S&amp;P and note if there's ever been any correlation. I have no interest in doing that, because with all due respect, I don't care :).
Bitcoin is a new up and coming tech that provides an alternative to an aged currency system. It provides accuracy in accounting that FIAT and gold could never come close to providing. As we move further into becoming a digital society, Bitcoin will align more with our way of handling financial transactions. 
If you want consider market price of Bitcoin, and not the big picture, than consider that many people believe that the catalyst for Bitcoin's rise from a few nodes to a global power house blockchain network was the 2008 market crash. 
So that being the case, one could say Bitcoin may be seen as a hedge. Personally, I think it is far too volatile "yet" to function as a proper hedge, but the fact remains, it's growing. It's new in terms of being a currency or store of value - ten years is a blip. The S&amp;P is a representation of company share prices. Now I get it, this is a crypto 'market' so people tend to talk markets with the same toolbox of verbiage . But to approach crypto with the same mentality as a stock share is futile. They are different entities.

It's been rising value for ten years since its inception. And up till the past few years there wasn't even near as much public awareness. Sure there's been spikes and dips but the overall movement is up. Anyone that doesn't see what's happening is not looking at the big picture. So no, I don't believe you made a bad decision, but there's never 100% certainty I suppose. Play the long game and there's a very good chance your investment will increase in value. These are very early days!
@_date: 2019-05-20 02:19:56
The fact alone that there even was a 60 minutes Bitcoin segment says it all. Bitcoin is rising at an unprecedented rate. As far as I'm concerned it's unstoppable.

The reality is that even with last year's hype, only a very tiny percentage of people have ever actually bought bitcoin. There are still many who don't know what bitcoin is, just that they heard of it. Still, this entity continues to grow, and continues to be developed and improved. Last year, the wait time for being approved on an exchange was enough that many were turned away. The process of dealing with account approvals, wallet addresses and storage devices was way over the average person's head. Now exchanges have ramped up their infrastructure, there are apps that allow you to buy and store bitcoin with a few clicks, and mainstream platforms like bakkt and proposed ETFs are entering the scene. The next phase will have a much lower barrier for entry. 
So in short, yeah - I am definitely one of the guys who believe there are cycles and we are just in the very early stages.

@_date: 2018-12-15 20:44:23
That's too bad. Have you mined in the early days? Researched via podcasts and interviews with actual developers? 50x your investment? Had a 20 year long career in It and network security? Joined a group of miners? Anyway good luck with your little reddit comment research. As I said TO EACH THEIR OWN. Don't invest, nobody cares what any of us do. Get over yourself.
@_date: 2018-12-07 00:00:53
I'd sell half if it hits 25k, otherwise it's accumulate for 5 years or so. Either way, I'm not in the least bit worried. After Mt. Gox days I'm not phased by price drops anymore lol.
@_date: 2018-12-12 23:05:37
You just need to research a little more. Remember on your 1980spornstar user account, or your noouser account, when everyone told you that? How about just yesterday we told you that on the second last reddit accout you had before this one?
Bitcoin is not a trinket. In this new digital age if you don't have at least some concept of fixed supply and a global ledger with tamper proof, decentralized accounting, why have you created a dozen reddit usernames to comment? You don't have the knowledge to comment with one reddit user account let alone multiple.

Ok so you won't be investing. Your choice, your business.
@_date: 2018-12-04 16:07:01
I'm actually pretty pumped about what's coming up in the next year, because this stage we're in now where people sound like they've given up and the end is coming, etc... is EXACTLY like the last few times which led directly into milestones of all time high in publicity, price, hype etc. 
What amazes me is how people don't realize that what they're saying is exactly what's been said for years, and yet they act like it's all new. You tell them and they say that worn out line about "the past performance is not indicative of future results", which is stupid because they're literally repeating past in every word they say. On top of that, the PAST has become more a part of our analyzing future than it ever has in history. Big data, charts, analysis, search trends, website analytics, literally every technical analysis we make is based on the past. Well, when it comes to Bitcoin, the past has shown us that this thing is just getting started.  
@_date: 2018-12-27 21:08:36

Naw. I've held, I've sold, and I've tried trading and hated it in this market (Big green and red dildos tend to appear without warning). I've done well over the past several years, but I've never once wavered from my stance - Bitcoin is here to stay and it's only going to get bigger. Like it, hate it, ignore it. It's happening and only a fool would be blind to not see it.
@_date: 2018-12-14 14:48:51
YES I am, particularly on the stock market. Unless something has changed with a company, (i.e. a bad earning report, acquisition, marketing catastrophe, etc), then a lower price has ALWAYS been an opportunity. Bitcoin in that regard, is no different. Nothing has changed other than more people are selling than buying. Now the smart people buy and sell when more people are buying. Simple.

This thing has already seen 20k on a test run. 6k is peanuts and technical levels are not enough to dismiss the money on standby waiting for confirmation that a bull market is in full swing.
@_date: 2019-05-02 12:50:15
Well I'm biased because in my opinion bitcoin is going to eat up a large portion of gold investments as it's well positioned as a solid value store. That's not even taking currency adoption into consideration, which still looks promising with LN, etc.
 
But... while bitcoin offers the highest likely of continuing to increase into the foreseeable future, XLM offers the larger x mutliplier of your investment short term. It could easily shoot up to $1 in a very short time with the right news.
So it's bitcoin for safest bet of solid positioning and future potential, and XLM with a more unknown future, but strong chance of a large X TIMES your money in a small time period.
@_date: 2018-12-06 01:36:33
Exactly, and as long as cars were not as efficient as horses, it was unlikely they would be adopted as the preferred transportation system. Bitcoin is the future. If it was the present we wouldn't see any opportunity to invest in it.

You'll only lose it all if you sell. The instrinsic value crap is not relevant in a speculative market that has already seen multiple bull markets that each trump the previous. Vegas didn't shut down because people lose money. It just continues to grow as more and more people want in on the game.

So instead of actually addressing /AussieBitcoiner's well made point about the global ledger verification which alone brings value as distributed, tamper-proof information, you just repeat the same shit you've been saying with another set of duck soup words. This is how your short-sighted view has overpowered your ability to open your mind and see the path that has already been etched into progression. Bitcoin is already started to sync with the social collective. Everything is data. One more generation with bitcoin, and your tiny simplified reason of how bitcoin can not be accepted and utilized as an alternative and functional currency will be decimated. Simple.

If you've been here before, you're probably seeing the beginning of a recovery. This happens alot and could easily continue to ramp up to a new ATH. If you're new, as in only been in this space a year or so, then you've been so conditioned to expect a big drop that you are pessimistic. Understandable, but have faith... this appears to be building momentum. If you haven't experienced a Bitcoin bullrun before, you're in for a treat.
@_date: 2018-12-07 00:04:28
Lmao awesome.
@_date: 2018-12-17 00:35:44
10 years is a drop in the bucket. There will come a day when the power of bitcoin as a global currency is fully recognized as it aligns with a world becomming more and more connected via digital communication. Most technologies start off as potential alternatives to the current solution. At first many people wonder how it could ever be a better alternative... such as early code based email - everyone questioned how it could possibly be better than the post delivered letter because it was cumbersome and required digital savvy users. Now here we are today. There are countless examples but you get my point. Things take time, and the short 10 years of bitcoin has been a great start so far. 
@_date: 2018-12-15 18:47:57
Wow how are there still people who think on such an elementary level? Do you realize how far Bitcoin has come? Do your own research, don't rely on complacent opinions that are blind to the potential and innovation happening here.
@_date: 2018-12-24 05:58:44
No it's not at all like a ponzi scheme. But it is a lazy way of making a comparison. It's like comparing an orange to a pumpkin because they share the same color. Look harder before you say things that showcase your lazy research. The demand of participants is a common denominator across the board. No customers no business. A currency and store of value needs to be valued by participants in order to function as such. That's what is happening with bitcoin. It's what's been happening for a decade. Acknowledge it, or pretend you think it's a 10 year ponzi scheme, either way this is happening. You'd be a blind fool not to see it.
@_date: 2018-12-06 13:40:07

Awesome, good job man. No need to be sad for Bitcoin. Bitcoin doesn't give a f what we speculate its price at, it'll just keep doing what it's always done. If the price gets ahead of itself sell it, if it drops close to the previous cycle high, buy it. All in good market fun :)

There are always efforts to emulate success. Bitcoin was created long before any idea of a crypto market that would be growing at exponential rates existed. BCH was created specifically to capitalize on that market. If you don't see the difference then you should not be commenting.

Doubt it. 6k is not nearly enough upwards pressure to spring back that low. The 20k hype run built up enormous pressure with profits that few sane people could resist taking. You won't get that kind of sell pressure at 6k. 6k will just signal a time to get back on board.

Don't put it all in at once is my only suggestion. It's not about how low it goes, most people with insight and time in this space agree that it will go back up of course - it's a market, but nobody is foolish enough to pretend they know when. It's become a very real active market, and one that is growing rapidly. 
In markets, you buy bear and sell bull. Sounds easy enough, but guessing the bottoms and tops only appear easy when looking back on charts. It's not easy looking forward. Some are saying $3250 is bottom, others are saying as low as $2500. Nobody knows, and if you average down you reduce your break even point and will eventually be buying the bottom. Those buys at bottom will return gains as soon as the recovery begins. Ignore noise, Ignore ridiculous claims both high and low, ignore trolls and FUD. The path Bitcoin is on has already been etched into progression. Bitcoin has already started to sync with the social collective program of human society, and seems very likely to continue evolving. Everything is data. Good luck!! 
@_date: 2018-12-06 00:19:50
That's your answer? Lol, no man my losses are only from bitcoin I bought since last year. Negligible. So unlike your limited 1 year memory, mine is quite good.

@_date: 2018-12-07 17:42:43
I like averaging down and up. It's worked out great over the years. But man, I do regret a few sells and missed buys before I started averaging. Averaging gives a comfortable feeling that the all in buys never provided me with.

Calling people dumb, crazy, basement dwellers, is more insulting than criticizing, don't you think? I mean honestly, not trying to fuel an argument here. If you come to a community sub for people interested in bitcoin and the call them those things do you think they should react kindly?
@_date: 2019-05-29 20:49:08
Do you really believe that the very tiny percentage of the billions of people who could potentially buy bitcoin that actually bought some in 2017 are the only ones that count? What about the people who barely even heard of it, let alone bought it? There are so many people left to enter this space that the small portion of people who got burned in 2017 isn't even enough to register in to the equation.

Well it really doesn't matter who 'buys' anything I'm doing. I'm sure there are loads of people far more invested than I am. I've never over invested, but I have been consistent. You think anybody buys that you're regularly posting in this bitcoin sub even though you think there's no potential ...for what? The good of your heart to set us all straight? Who cares of people buy, sell or hold? Who cares if there are people who bought high hoping to recover losses? If there is enough new volume it won't matter and if there's not, well I guess a bull market won't be maintained anyway. Nobody knows for sure, but I really wish people would stop stereotyping everyone who invests in bitcoin.

Just an expression. You short something you believe will lose value over a specific time frame, and you long something that you believe will gain value going forward in the long term. The expression basically means that as we move forward, your money is better off in bitcoin than in banks. This may be true, but if so it's going to take some time, as in many, many years.

Bitcoin is a placeholder, and a damn efficient one on a global level. If 21 million units are eventually shared among a global population, then it won't be smaller than pennies, because a single bitcoin will be used to account for a much larger sum of value. The smaller divisible units allow for scalability far into the future. That's the whole point.
@_date: 2018-12-13 00:12:22

Don't be a fool... bitcoin is literally 20X more secure than btrash and 100+X more secure than most other alts. The future is being built, nobody said it was already finished. So yeah, "lmao" your little teenage face off, and see who gets the last laugh child.

Your perspective is extremely restricted. I'm not insulting you, you may be quite intelligent, but your allowing yourself to be limited by traditional thinking. If we all did that, we'd have zero innovation. 
It's never been just agreeing, it's about valuing. And it sure as hell is not about keeping their word lol. If people know that they can buy a Rolex watch for a certain amount of bitcoin, then the person selling that watch would know that he can get an equal amount of value for that bitcoin.
If it's not uncomfortable to think about outside your usual box, then it's not going to ever give you the tiniest glimpse of the future. Things we're doing today were completely unthinkable 100 years ago. You need to get your timeline straight - this kind of thing isn't going to happen next week. It takes generations.

If you feel that way how many others out there are in the same mindset would you say? PLENTY! So sit back, and take comfort that there will never be a shortage of people who want to put some money they can risk into this market. It had an exceptional run last year, way over the top kind of good, so this year had a way over the top kind of bad. Without balance there is nothing. I'm thinking we are at the bottom now and it will be slow upward growth from here. Take a look at the Nasdaq composite chart which represents thousands of tech companies and how hype played out in their early stages during the dot com bubble. Hype is hype ...it works very similar throughout all verticals - web, weed ,crypto etc. But after the hype there is real growth, and bitcoin being a currency hybrid asset, can experience multiple hype bubbles due to its nature and cross platform use.

Noooo, not the start yet. You won't need to ask me that question when it starts. You'll know. I have no argument, just that Bitcoin is overall on an upward trend since day one. It doesn't matter to me what anyone else does with their money or how they predict price movements you have to take your stance and hold it. We don't need to repeat the same old song and dance on this. I have been thinking around 2025 for some serious gains, plus I think that the time between now and then will allow for some layers that make ease of use a priority. But yeah, another bull run is coming, and I enjoy them. Not just for the gains but there's something about a bitcoin bull run that just makes stocks and other investments seem boring af lol.
@_date: 2018-12-07 20:26:25
They mined a lot of it years ago and bought more after that. I have heard prices in conversation and remember thinking that 80 bucks was too rich for my blood when they used to tell me I should get involved. I know ......I know, I was dumb lol. They have been using bitcoin to generate more bitcoin. They trade, use tether a lot and also use BitMEX. Sorry I don't have an exact answer for you!
@_date: 2018-12-14 14:33:38
So you're worried it can still go lower? Many people think it can but nobody knows. Bitcoin may be a completely new entity as a hybrid asset class/currency/value store, but in terms of the crypto market, it's still like the stock market in many ways.
Discovering bottoms is mostly guessing, but there are indicators and trends that analysts look for. Volume, averages etc.
It's largely physiology. Nobody knows for sure where the new buyers are comfortable, but because it's a market there's always going to be buyers who want to get in where they feel is the best entry point. If you're comfortable with shorts there's always that. Personally I prefer averaging down.

@_date: 2018-12-07 17:02:15
I hate price predictions and anyone that predicted a specific price for a specific time correctly was lucky. We can all agree on that.
I'm probably one of the more positive posters on here because I'm confident Bitcoin has a strong future.
That being said, in terms of the market, if you're averaging down you may want to buy your lion's share just a little lower, perhaps between 2900 and 3200. We may even see a short term bullish move but after a few meetings with 8 years bitcoiners this AM, the sentiment is that the bull market will likely kick in full swing somewhere very close to 3k within the next 2-4 months. You can take that  for what its worth, just passing along some info from a few guys who know this market very well.
@_date: 2018-12-09 03:58:32
No, it's a future that hasn't arrived yet, and for that reason people enjoy speculating on it. There are always multiple stances on these things, and though we are all guilty of getting carried away, it's not a reason to call people stupid or assume they're over invested and ruined. Bottom line, there's a huge difference in constructive criticism and not feeling a technology will thrive, and mindless insults for the sake of trolling to devalue a community sub.

Well you're wrong on both fronts. People love to speculate and there are entire industries built around it, the crypto market being one of the most recent rapidly growing industries. Bitcoin is very useful if you have vision. If you continue to evaluate it based on current conditions you will miss out. This is the future that everyone loves to speculate over!  Thankfully there are people like you though, otherwise everyone would acknowledge where this is all headed and there would be no opportunity for those of us who are betting on its success.
@_date: 2019-05-01 23:32:24
Because you didn't realize that reserves are not exclusive to cash, that makes me full of shit? He he. Look, you clearly were only regurgitating crap articles anyway, but you don't need to lower yourself to i insulting me, to try and divert attention away from your cluelessness. I was in this space since tether existed. You read bullshit on the internet and think you know things. Lol ... you couldn't even wrap your head around reserves that are not liquid.
@_date: 2018-12-07 04:50:05
Christ no. I talk very little about my investments with friends and family, and to be fair 90% of my investments are in dividend stocks and real estate. But I've done well in the past with bitcoin and they're aware of that. Not everyone has the stomach for this market's volatility. It's a bit of fun though you have to admit. I'll sell when it's high buy when it's low. We can post in here but need to ignore all this noise when buying, because you don't buy when people are taking out loans to buy btc at 20k, smart money buys it low.
@_date: 2018-12-07 00:57:12

That's what I said isn't it? This past year people predicting a pull back to the pre-Dec 17 runup were right, and now it's back to where it was. Nobody knows where it goes from here, but whether you predict a drop or another run up, you'll probably be right eventually :).

Perhaps you should familiarize yourself with the Lindy Effect. Nobody knows what the future holds, but the Lindy Effect tells us is that time is now on Bitcoin's side.
My intention is not to insult you at all, in fact I appreciate that there is usually a sound argument to every position. I just find it's dangerous whenever a person claims to be certain of anything regarding future events, particularly something that has been debated for years by very intelligent people. The thing to note here, is that the danger usually exists within that person's perceived reality that they could not possibly be wrong.

@_date: 2018-12-14 19:06:31
Yes, EXACTLY. What part of high-risk do you not understand? I've allocated a small portion of my investments to high risk for years, and since Bitcoin has been an option the high risk game has been a lot more enjoyable. Not to mention my gains up until this crappy year were awesome. It can't be a good year every year. If I loose what I left in, well that's the high risk game. I enjoy this market a lot. If you made through Mt. Gox, this is a joke. 
@_date: 2018-12-07 00:49:22
It's the 'future'. A single actor can swing the price because it's the present. As more people own bitcoin, it will be far more difficult to manipulate. It needs to be distributed even more.
@_date: 2018-12-08 03:36:46
Brings me back to when I was 5 and that shit was funny. Ahhhh, to be you.
@_date: 2018-12-14 14:40:17
Yes it is. And if you feel Bitcoin will go lower then short it, or stay away. That's what's funny about all of this. Not a single person can say they they didn't know that this market was new and largely based on speculation when they got in. So many of my acquaintances saw the profits I made and wanted in - I told them as I tell everyone, "you will need a strong stomach for the wild ride, and it is going to go down again at some point, it always does". But all anyone can see for the first ride is the ups, never the downs. So calling it gold at 20k or garbage at $1 is all perspective. If you're here to play the market, judge the bottom on the knowledge you've accumulated and be smart. Cheap digs about the price high or low is not going to get you anywhere.
@_date: 2018-12-11 00:08:01

I have no clue what you're talking about. You seem upset about something but it has nothing to do with me. I don't brag about my bitcoin investments nor any of my other investments. When we mined with GPU's we took what we thought at the time were great returns. Of course bitcoin sees corrections, it's just profit taking. But in the long term the trend is and I believe will continue to be, up for generations to come.

Edit: to be clear we're talking about a reserve, as I said in previous comment, "in this scenario". A reserve does not have to be cash. Did you even read the statement that Tether released on March 14th?
@_date: 2019-05-01 14:19:43
Well they clarified things pretty well in March. But if you want to go after non truths, then prepare to condemn every financial institution, politician, and government out there. And if you prioritize based on the severity and agenda of the lie, tether will be far from the top of your list. They've been pretty forthcoming as of late.

Your ignorance and lack of education are exceeded only by your obvious lack of self-esteem. Sorry man, whatever messed with you (bitcoin) did a real number on you. Most people I know invested in Bitcoin are using disposable income after other priorities and investments were met, and they worked very hard to be in that situation. Your ignorance of this is a reflection of what you hate about yourself. Snap out of it.
@_date: 2018-12-17 17:07:21
I can't know you're wrong anymore than you can know you're right, but $3200 is looking more and more like the bottom. And not just because of this little bounce in the price.
@_date: 2018-12-14 02:34:01
Yeah well 20 years in IT and systems security, I think I have a decent idea if what tech catches on. 
Listen, you just basically regurgitated what Ive been saying for years regarding crypto. You are contradicting your own perspective. You are absolutely correct, what Bitcoin has been doing this past decade is slowly emerging. But currency being of the nature that it is, embedded so deeply into the fabric of society, will take generations to change shape. Ten years is a drop in the bucket. That bitcoin is happening is hardly debatable because it's already happening! The only thing debatable is the market ups and downs.
@_date: 2018-12-12 06:18:50
Yes, and the time frame and  time in between buys would be your decision. Usually if something is moving fast, you buy more frequently, and if it's moving slowly you can buy every week or even two. Bitcoin may drop a little more, nobody knows where the price will bottom out before reversing and recovering. But that fact that so many people are now inquiring about buying this low is a good indicator that we're probably close!
@_date: 2018-12-05 01:42:47


He he, think about what you are saying. Everyone's goal is to sell it because they feel they'll get a great deal for it. That's why everyone's goal is to sell money in exchange for what it gets them as well. So I guess you are supporting the fact that Bitcoin can indeed function as money! Good job finally understanding this!
@_date: 2018-12-05 04:00:18

You guys are so dramatic ha ha. Remember the whole 'emotional detachment' rule of investing? It would do some good in this space. If you're day trading you can be making a killing and if you're going long then who cares about the current bear market? No situation should be emotional or dramatic.
@_date: 2018-12-02 12:33:14
Anyone that is weak and gullible enough to condemn bitcoin...or buy butcoin for that matter, based on a post by an annonymous Redditor without doing any of thier own research - well they were never going to make much of a difference anyway.
Edit: But I agree that trolls have no life. Think of it like a bad review - people who feel anger, or as though they were done wrong, are usually the ones that make 90% of the noise, while the pleased people feel
no urgency to vent their frustration. I honestly think most trolls are just bitcoin investors who put up more than they could afford to lose and are taking out their frustration on bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-12-01 19:09:45

Nothing wrong with taking profits but this thing appears to be building momentum. I haven't seen this many people on various boards ask about buying bitcoin since last year.
@_date: 2018-12-20 04:26:40
If you bank on your phone, like most of the modern day population, then are you worried about the same thing? A bitcoin wallet can be reinstalled and recovered if the device is lost or damaged. Also, you cold storage the larger amount (think savings, or held amount) and you carry with you on app a smaller amount for transactions.
@_date: 2018-12-16 06:38:27
Nobody knows, things are moving faster in this market all the time though and the process of buying bitcoin for newcomers to the space is way easier than it was even just last year. We'll see how it plays out. I can see a bull market coming, but not a bull run for a while, if that makes any sense.
@_date: 2018-12-05 12:21:07
Don't be such a drama queen. It's a market and the price will be up and down depending on the year. Don't let this past year shaoe your perspective. You buy bitcoin when the world has moved on, as you say lol. Sell when the world wants it.
@_date: 2018-12-03 23:34:48
If you invest 5k and lose 85% of it (assuming you had to sell), then the loss is exactly the same, regardless of the price of Bitcoin. I won't assume you weren't involved during the Mt. Gox days, but in case you weren't, let me tell you - the damage to investors then and the damage to Bitcoin's reputation then were both far greater than what I've seen this past year. Each time there's a run up the top gets higher, and each bubble dwarfs the previous, making it appear insignificant. this entire narrative is a repeat. When the price first hit 1k that seemed like a monstrosity of a bubble at the time. The next run up will make 20k look tiny, but I am not naive enough to assume I know when that will be.

@_date: 2018-12-10 03:16:43
Well I hate to get typical, but the global aspect of bitcoin, not being tied to any one fiat, provides something that a shrinking world could really benefit from. A store of value that aligns with a digital society and knows no geographical boundaries has great potential. As for the elderly  folks you speak of, they will be long deceased before something as etched into our lives as currency could ever be reshaped. Mass adoption would take generations at minimum. Many potential developments could divert the direction of all this so as I said earlier, all we have at this early point is speculation...as we see by the rapidly growing crypto market. I enjoy the high risk investment game, and I only use disposable income that I can afford to lose after other investments are secured.
@_date: 2018-12-06 18:56:31
Especially for me. I'll probably make more from this next bull market than the last 2 so yeah, amusing is one way of looking at it. Sorry if you only buy when everyone else is buying. I'll be selling you my coins then, and you can sell me yours now :)
@_date: 2018-12-07 18:37:27
Bitcoin has a self preservation mechanism whereby it monitors the amount of blocks mined over time (Ithink it's 2 weeks) and adjusts it's algorithm accordingly. You can research it further but basically it compensates for the addition and subtraction of miners and their equipment. So in the very worst case scenario it would drop back to being able to be mined on a PC (highly unlikely), in which case I know I would go back to mining and so would millions of others. Then the entire cycle would play out again. Either way, Bitcoin is not going anywhere, don't you worry.
@_date: 2019-05-18 20:56:38
You sound EXACTLY like so many others when it was 3200, 4k, 5k, 6k, 7k.... why do you guys say this everytime the big guys take profit? I've been listening to the same crap for so many years, and kuat genuinely curious how you guys never learn.
@_date: 2018-12-02 21:38:49
You're not the first to believe you can predict the future of bitcoin based on charts, and many intelligent people have been wrong on this front. 
Unfortunately, since the past year has seen a pullback from the hyped up fast rise of last December when the price got ahead of itself, more people than ever have become self proclaimed experts. A more realistic perspective is that the price is back to the path it was on before the hyped run up of Dec 2017.
@_date: 2018-12-05 23:23:12
Just stick around a while. Keep posting your opinion all you want with your high frequency, it's yours to have. But stick around, watch, and learn. This has been going on for a long time. Bitcoin has a great future and I believe will one day be used as a mainstream  currency and value store. But for now? It's a speculative market, and the game is simple. Drop it down till even the strongest hands drop their bags, and then grab it cheap, pump it up and rinse and repeat. Each bull being higher than the previous and this can go on for years. Once you learn the hard way, you tend to hold the bag a little tighter, because nobody knows where it tops or bottoms.

If you compare how the bottom of the last bear market felt to how it felt at $16,000, it wasn't even close. Sure, there was some negativity, there has ALWAYS been some. But only now does it actually feel like the bottom of the last bear market. As I said, when "most" people are crying that it's dead, and it seems that we are around that point now. Well, to be honest it seemed even more doomed during Mt. Gox, but it's pretty close!

You created a Reddit account just to come on here and promote negative sentiment for Bitcoin? That's cute.
But sorry, many others have tried this and it has been established over the past 5 years or so that user posts on Reddit have zero impact on price. Bitcoin just keeps getting bigger and bigger and bigger .. volatile? Hell yes. Some years with terrible price performance? Oh hell yeah, look at this past year. Shit show!
But overall in the big picture, Bitcoin is here to stay and will likely continue to grow its roots into every fabric of society over the next 50 years. And there's not a damn thing you can do about it.

Read a book or something, please get educated. Market price has no impact on bitcoin dying. This is not even insulting you and your trolling.

Well either way, ask youself. Do you really think the price dropped because bitcoin failed, or because things were chugging along for 9 years and all of a sudden, BAM price jumps from 1k to 20k in less than a year? It was hyped and way over inflated and absolutely had to correct. Perhaps in the future it will turn out that you're correct and the project fails,  but currently, I believe this is a retracement to the path it was on before that crazy bubble of 2017.

So you're rationalizing that this is a bear trap for shorters, which was created to set off a bull trap? No offence, but there doesn't always have to be a reason for everything.

No questions are dumb. Seeking information is always smart. Cash App is ideal for small purchases and in those cases, the ease of use and convenience are well worth it. If you are only buying $100 or less here and there, Cash App is a great choice. As for leaving it on the app, that's a bit subjective. I mean make sure that you log out of the app in case you lose your phone, or someone steals it for sure. Once you've accumulated several hundred or especially thousands of dollars though, I would definitely move the Bitcoin to a cold storage wallet such as the Ledger Nano S. This makes sense because you not only control your own private keys but you also drastically reduce the risk of theft. Now if you plan on spending the Bitcoin for purchases however, then keep it on the cash app!! 
The services such as the one you mentioned are each independently run, and like any service, some may be shady and others legit. Do your own research on each specific service, but don't expect to make much money from these - they most likely pay very low.

Of course the tech hasn't failed. A new currency takes generations to succeed. Called it failed before it even gets off the ground is incredibly premature.

They're valued in Bitcoin, because Bitcoin is the king of crypto. If Bitcoin price increases, then the amount of bitcoin that an alt coin is worth can remain the same, but the value in USD will show as higher.

You're being extremely short sighted, the single most common mistake in history when evaluating future potential. It's simply too soon to make the assumptions you hold. You don't condemn a successful moon landing before finishing the development of the thrusters, but you can be damn well sure there will be varying opinions regarding the potential outcome. In short, your perspective is premature.

Smart man. This is the best way hands down to recognize gains sooner.

So this is what you were referring to when you said you didn't bash Bitcoin? Ha ha - or would you like to be all passive aggressive again and say you're just here to discuss Bitcoin on a serious level? You are the joke. Market selling and buying is not a reason to name Bitcoin a shitcoin. Though based on the maturity of your previous comments, this is all we can expect from you. 
@_date: 2018-12-07 00:30:51
Same thing it always does. Nothing to see here. Mt. Gox, Craig Wright, there will always be something going on in these early wild west days of crypto. If it was boring none of us would be here.

The biggest problem with this is that you honestly don't even realize how stupid you sound. You should not be posting about bitcoin when you know so little. It just makes you sound like a moron.
@_date: 2018-12-12 23:48:00
Give it a rest. I already explained that several attempts to talk Bitcoin with you on a serious level just went around in circles. You don't repeatedly post on a forum for a community you have no support for. Sure, perhaps a random negative comment since you think Bitcoin is going to 1k, whatever. But talking down the price over and over?
@_date: 2018-12-05 22:45:32
Agreed. I've said to many skeptics, if Bitcoin survived Mt. Gox, it can survive anything. The negative publicity, damage to investors, damage to bitcoin reputation and people crying that bitcoin was dead back then was way worse than it is today, yet still it has thrived since then.

I understand my friend. But there will still be time. This catalyst is buy in from larger entities, and Fidelity pretty much gave us a heads up. Next will be Bakkt later in the year and several other institutional players. 20k will look like peanuts when this is played out, so there is still time.
@_date: 2018-12-03 12:47:38
Yeah but they're harmless. They're pissed at bitcoin and want to vent, probably because they bought in high with more than they could lose.
Unless anyone thinks they take the time to post about something they don't support because they're that bored.
@_date: 2018-12-07 19:47:05
It's so far away that realistically, at the rate at which tech evolves, there will be so much updated with the bitcoin network, the nodes the comprise it, side chains, protocols, layers, etc, that it is literally impossible to even speculate with any degree of accuracy. It's over 100 years away. There will be a worldwide massive ecosystem built around bitcoin by then, and you can rest assured that this issue will be addressed. 
@_date: 2018-12-15 20:51:14
I'm not insulting you, and if my risk money left in bitcoin brings me returns like I enjoyed precious years I still won't waste it on a Lamborghini. I'd probably just switch it into another high risk and pay off a few rental properties. 
Bitcoin is already syncing with society. It's a very slow process, and one that won't be fully recognized until we're dead and gone.
I can't begin to express the difference between now and when I first got involved with this space. I don't blame anyone for their negative perceptions based on this one past year. But the strives that this project has made in 10 short years is incredible, and it's a shame that so many judge it only on the speculated price in the crypto market.
@_date: 2018-12-14 02:47:51
Wow what happened man? You lost your job typing shit troll posts for pennies? Man that's rough. Sorry to hear. It just wasn't a good fit for you, let's face it - you couldn't make it work with the past 12 reddit user accounts. But you'll find your calling, keep the faith!
@_date: 2018-12-15 20:15:28
Don't mind the trolls they have little else to do and some are paid pennies per post to bullshit (someone's not getting their money's worth).
You only owe taxes on gains, so basically if you bought 9 out of 10 years, you'd have gains. This only applies of course if you actually sell.
@_date: 2018-12-14 18:16:14
If you put any weight in what analysts think, the general opinion is that the very bottom is somewhere around twice the value of the last cycle's peak. That was $1100. That's not saying we will ever drop to 2200, that's where analysts are saying the rock bottom is, based on volume, moving averages, market psychology, etc. Rock bottoms are rarely met unless something extreme happened. If you're lucky enough to buy at rock bottom, the more power to you but people who wait for that often end up having to buy higher. Averaging down is king. 
@_date: 2018-12-13 23:59:39
I agree with that. And as more money flows into bitcoin it will drive the price upward  we've been doing song and dance for years, not really news. Buy it, sell it , short it or hold it. Nothing's changed except upward long term trajectory.
@_date: 2018-12-10 23:00:53
What's this your 5th user account? 10th? You desperately need a life.
@_date: 2018-12-14 21:01:55
Ahhh, bought in the past year did you? Sorry man, but if you hold it, you'll recover your losses. I sold a lot of mine for many times what I paid, but I'm still holding a small portion from buys I made years ago, AND I've been averaging down with a little risk money this past year too!
If you think it's all a scheme or 'coupons' just don't put money in! It's not for everyone. I secure my main investments first, so this is play money and it's worked out great. It's fun too. But I'm not sure what you're doing in this thread - it can't be that enjoyable for anyone who thinks its worthless.
@_date: 2018-12-17 18:10:23
It's not that people don't want to answer you, it's that what you're asking has been asked so many times over the past  5+ years or so. We're just tried of answering the same questions.
I believe that a global currency on a tamper proof ledger that can be applied to endless scenarios to provide benefits going forward is worth betting on. Of course we want to see gains on our investment, but most people I know personally that are invested in Bitcoin also believe it has an incredibly bright future as an alternative mainstream currency, particularly for future generations in a digital society. That being said, this is indeed a very speculative market... but a very real market that is growing rapidly and not going away. So, in short to answer your question, a little of both!
@_date: 2018-12-07 17:53:59
Ok well, I can't know for certain, but I've only ever seen the term used when referring to those non investors who claim to never buy crypto but still make hundreds of posts in a crypto reddit sub like this one. The posts are usually talking down to a user who has money invested, and with little intention other than to insult them and criticize their person decision to do what they choose with their own money. So my guess would be that 'no coiner' is used to basically tell those people to mind their own business, since they are not even invested and have no stance to pass judgment.
@_date: 2018-12-05 17:45:35
Exactly. Whenever 'everyone' starts chiming in with the same expectations, expect the bigger, smarter money to do the exact opposite. 
@_date: 2019-05-14 13:35:57
Many of the most prominent, experienced, and most respected bitcoiners, podcast hosts, and influencers in the crypto space were adamant that we would see a significant drop after 6200, and then they all said it again about 7200. Neither happened, and here we are. Bottom line, nobody has a f'ing clue. Buy and hold.
@_date: 2018-12-04 00:00:00
Nope, I draw the line at people with your mentality. That you even used that word in that way shows your maturity level. I have multiple conversations going on, and not just on Reddit ..if you don't want me to reply then don't return comments. 
@_date: 2018-12-19 19:20:58
I've always been optimistic with Bitcoin. It's up over 750% in the past 3 years alone. I never look at one single year for Bitcoin which is a growing entity. It's saturation is so tiny compared to where it's going to be within the next decade. Whales can do their thing. Hell, they're going to be doing their thing for years to come, that's a given, but their pumps have always been the catalyst for bullruns in Bitcoin. If they see indication of momentum they'll obviously wait to dump a higher price just like they did last year. Why dump 4k when you can dump 10k, or whatever.
@_date: 2018-12-06 19:26:21

Over the next few years. Give it time. I know you're anxious to see your money grow but trust me, it takes time. Buy in 2014-2015, realize gains in 2017. Buy now, same time frame could be in store. Nobody knows.

Majority. For sure. That was a few months out of a decade where the fomo was out of control.
@_date: 2018-12-03 20:01:00
Anyone who says the price is going to drop to 3k or lower 'wants' it to drop. Anyone saying the price is going to climb up from here 'wants' it to rise. Nobody could possibly know. There's not a lot of Craig Wrights out there with millions, willing to sell their holdings at these prices to fuel a feud with their rival. Anyone that's been holding since before last year, and has not already sold would need a pretty strong reason to sell now. If it's profit taking, they'd have likely already sold at previous much higher prices, so there would have to be some scenario that's changed that required them to liquidate, and that's not something anyone here knows. What we're seeing here now is profit taking between 3700 and 4200, and this could go on for as long as the people involved are able to milk it. As for a more dramatic drop or rise in the market price, well that rides 100% on the speculation that has been the strategy of valuation since day 1.
@_date: 2018-12-17 18:31:47
You can't possibly paint everyone with the same brush. When Bitcoin was created there was no speculative market, yet it made enormous strides to eventually have an entirely new trading market built around it. If you can't see where this is heading, and heading fast, you are not looking.   
People are involved in Bitcoin for a wide variety of reasons. Sure, some are after gains, some love this shit. The guys that got me into Bitcoin were mining it back when their main reason was that they just loved the concept. You can't stereotype all bitcoin investors that way, and you have to know you're wrong.
@_date: 2018-12-21 01:10:45
Somebody lied to you. It's not like that at all. You look at how far Bitcoin is from market saturation and how many more people are jumping in the game. Now consider that the world is the market, not just one country. Then consider we have years to reach saturation and the supply remains fixed. It's not hard to do the math. There's no rush. Any of us in this ride for the past 5 years or so have the worst over with. We're certainly mot going anywhere now.
Where do you guys get this notion that the only holders are in the red? Did you just learn about bitcoin a year ago?
@_date: 2018-12-20 13:17:35

Deflecting much? You seems a little upset. Don't you worry little man, I can hold my own bags nice and tight untill I'm ready to release. It'll take more than your little peanut gallery comments to make any difference. Trust me .. I've had these debates with far smarter than you, and the only real conclusion is that this is a market. In markets, you buy low sell high, period. Nothing is dead, nothing is going away, there's high prices and low prices. You choose your entry point or fuck off and do something else.

I'm tired of explaining this to people like yourself. The internet is a free resource. I've answered countless questions on these forums over the years, but you're just talking ridiculous.
There are 195 countries in the world. There are approximately 25 federal countries in the world today, which together represent 40 per cent of the world's population. You honestly think for even a second that bitcoin was created by one of those governments as a global currency/asset? Think about what you're saying man.
@_date: 2018-12-12 14:53:32
Naw, it's easy to envision. Bitcoin is on a very clear path, already far to deeply etched into progression to stop now. There are loads of people waiting to buy in low just like any market. The crypto market is new and thriving - anyone that tells you otherwise has not taken a very deep look. 
@_date: 2019-05-23 00:19:16
It's expected to see profit taking on the way up. Nothing to worry about if you DCA.
@_date: 2018-12-22 21:43:46
So the conspiracy theory that the US government created bitcoin is false and this theory is true? :)
@_date: 2018-12-14 02:45:32
If that bothers you, then you'd be appalled at the origin of many of the things you say, eat and use every day.

@_date: 2018-12-07 01:16:24
It said a hell of a lot more than the bcash feud. And we lost a lot on the btc price for a long time. But the negativity and the poisen that flowed in forums and public sentiment was worse than now even. The credibility was devastated. Yet, somehow it came back. I sold half my holdings and regretted since. I'm more than confident we can come back from this one. 
The forks and tokens represent a byproduct of every successful project on the planet - an attempt to emulate that success. Anyone can copy a business model for example, but not make it work. These cheap imitations only further exhibit the popularity and success of bitcoin and will serve to strengthen it in the big picture.

I don't trade fool. When something goes from 1k to 20 k in a year wtf you trading for? I never got it all out at 20k but nevertheless it was unneccessary to trade. As for this time around if you can't see that FOMO is eating the selling pressure in very much the same way it did in the 2017 then you're not looking. If it does pull back a little along the way? I'll buy more. Don't overcomplicate this, the bear is over and thus most trading opportunity along with it.
@_date: 2018-12-01 20:20:39
I've learned over many years of involvement within technology trends, investing, flipping, etc, that anytime anyone ever says the words "I know, with 100% certainty", that there's a 90% chance they are full of shit. Especially when there are multiple intelligent people with nothing to gain who say otherwise. The first thing you need to consider is that there are endless possibilities of tweeks and improvements to any technology that nobody has even thought of yet. These changes can radically impact what you think is possible. The future has not happened yet - never say you can predict it with 100% certainly, it just makes you sound like a fool.

Fair enough, and yes we look for patterns. but when the price moves several hundred dollars within an hour like yesterday, we know it's big players doing their thing. Since they have the money, I wouldn't waste time trying to play their game, so like you I've been averaging down and accumulating.

@_date: 2018-12-08 16:49:52
No, but clearly you've got it all figured out because your understanding of deflation is extremely limited. I'm sure you'll take your opinion to the grave, even if Bitcoin continues to grow as it has for the past ten years. My first bitcoin cost me 570 bucks.

As usual hey? Thanks for owning up anyway. Man you're slow. That's hilarious.
@_date: 2018-12-01 15:27:12
You are spot on. The issue is not with the logic, or with the ability to comprehend it. The issue, as almost always with bitcoin, is the refusal of people with the anti-bitcoin perspective to accept it. 
I am noticing far fewer anti-bitcoin perspectives than I did a few years ago, so there is progress. I think informative, well explained information such as the above will continue to encourage the skeptics to open their mind. The world is ready for a much more accurate and accountable  digital currency and value store. One might even say we need it badly.

That was extrememly well said. Your analogy is dead on the mark, and is exactly my point. No buggy maker can only see things from the perspective of what he has lived and learned. The concept if cars and planes are science fiction at this point to this individual. Some may have vision, but more will not venture outside their comfort zone of perspective.
As for the name calling,  it is a complete waste of time, but people using upwards of a dozen or more user account on here really bugs me. I guess we all have our triggers!
Thanks for the insightful comment.
@_date: 2018-12-10 23:50:36
No, but to be honest I've never experienced that in years, though I've heard of delayed transactions, particularly last December. Improvements such as LN address this, and will continue to as we move forward. There was no future for streaming video when the first 30 years of internet had no bandwidth to accomodate. Email was text based at first, highly complicated for any average person and initially higly criticized as a potential means of mainstream communication. No sane supporter if bitcoin feels it could be mass adopted as it stands right now. We're betting on the future when we invest in high risk potential tech. If it was already evolved to mainstream status, there would be no investment opportunity.
@_date: 2018-12-18 17:21:29
Nobody can say where the best entry point is, so the bet strategy remains averaging down/up with smaller buy amounts. This way, you won't have put all your money in one price that could still drop. Also, if you buy in intervals you will have bought some at the lowest price and begin making gains on that buy as soon as the price recovers. This market is volatile and can move fast. Most selling seems to have been done, and it 'appears' we may be headed up going forward, but there is zero guarantee.  One would think that anyone who was going to sell a large amount would have done so by now but anything can happen.
@_date: 2018-12-12 13:33:57
Anyone could cherry pick an article from the past to align with whatever outcome they'd like to support. There have been literally thousands of articles with every possible perspective. That article did not predict anything.
It's a market and currently it's a bear market, but could change anytime. More and more people are talking about buying now that the price is at a low that aligns with their comfort point of entry. Nothing is dying or going away and smart money buys low averaging down, and sells high. No drama club necessary.

If depends on whether or not you want to start receiving inbound connections and allow your node to contribute to the network. There was talk years ago about vulnerabilities on the open port (usually TCP Port 8333), but don't think much came out of that claim. UPnP works on the LAN level. It allows individual client machines on your LAN to open a required port on the WAN-side of the router. You can also accomplish this with port forwarding Port 8333 on your router to whichever machine is running the node on your home network...if you're comfortable with leaving that port open.

It's refreshing to actually hear constructive criticism against bitcoin that DOESN'T once mention the phrase "zero value". That means you totally grasp the concept of it not being a product, service or company stock share. 
Yes, the future is unmapped and biometric payments are likely around the next tech curve and could radically improve existing fiat bridges. I can't disagree with any of this. I do however, think the volatility of bitcoin will mitigate once the supply is more distributed. Either way, it will be interesting to see how it plays out. For now, we've always got the good old speculative crypto market!!

NO. I only talk to those who 'think'. You aren't thinking, you're just spewing the same crap over and over.
@_date: 2018-12-06 20:32:53
Well then learn to read. I never tell anyone else to do anything and I never try to be foolish enough to predict the tops or bottoms. You need to think in terms of what you are doing with your money and less about what others are doing with theirs. When Bitcoin moves 85% in any directions that's 85% of your investment. So the bull runs are equally as impacting and yes there will be many more, it's common fucking sense. 
@_date: 2018-12-15 16:23:03
There's always people right about price guesss but the Mt. Gox thing is as much speculation as the price is. This thing is gonna go up and down for years to come. No drama necessary.

I absolutely don't take it as a slam. It was a mature and insightful comment and I very much appreciate the insight.
Since you have an angle with experience on the institutional side of things, what do you think of the information in the video linked below? Do you think the "facts" regarding these institutions buying bitcoin is accurate? I'd value your take on this:

Nope, they don't call me back. But terrorists and grandmothers and everyone in between can hold bitcoin, just like fiat. 
@_date: 2018-12-09 13:06:53
Is there any reason why you've been repetitively posting this same thing for almost a 24 hour period? If you think bitcoin is useless, then why would you dedicate such time and effort to post in its Reddit sub? 
I think that's a fair question, since posts in here have zero impact on price. I'm just curious.

Man Bitcoin is holding its own quite well in this stock mess. I did not expect the stock market to  come down this hard. A lot of people are going to have a pretty rough Christmas. I was expecting BTC to be hit but so far it's making out the  best of all of it!

@_date: 2018-12-28 15:17:50
This is not even in the same ballpark. Bitcoin is a hybrid entity as a currency, asset and store of value. It's decentralized and global. It's already the center of an entire crypto ecosystem. Any centralized Google coin or Amazon coin could never possibly replace bitcoin because it can't fulfill the same functionality and would be owned and controlled by a corporation. It's not in any way the same entity. Even entertaining this thinking would be impossible.
@_date: 2018-12-05 15:13:17
I hate to acknowledge it, but it looks like BCHSV is actually weathering this better than most crypto. Bcash is getting smashed more and more every day though. I'm not involved in the whole fork drama/feud but it seems like slow and steady is winning the race for the SV version. Either way, Bitcoin is still the king and will remain so, at least for many years to come.
@_date: 2018-12-03 22:50:47
You just keep peaching your price predictions, like thousands of other people...some who are far more involved. You might guess right and you might guess wrong. I've talked about the potential of this tech plenty in this sub, but occasionally I take a dig at people like you, because price predictions are a dime a dozen and everyone thinks they're an expert in a speculative market. It gets old. Instead of trying to be a price prophet, how about providing something useful about bitcoin's potential?
@_date: 2018-12-14 00:18:24
Pffft, it's a market. The most bearish analysts out there, even Bloomberg's McGlone expects another ath as bitcoin continues its growth into products, on-ramps and advanced exchanges in the growing crypto market. But in the meantime, trading is profitable in this bear market and averaging down is not a bad idea. Even if it drops to 2k, who cares? It's a huge market and only the brain dead would expect this to go away.
People would have bet their right arm it would never hit 20k and they'd bet their left arm that it would never drop below 5k again. They'd be armless now. Ignore that shit man, it's going to be up and down long after we're dead of old age. Don't be among the people trying to pretend you know it's going to stop. If anything it's barely started.
@_date: 2018-12-14 03:18:09

I hope there us at least a couple of people here who realize what's going on. Alts are dragged down when BTC drops. Well, just have a look at BCHSV. If you're wonder how the price is dropping so much in minutes, take a look at the gains on BCHSV. Now when it finally crushes BCH, and chest thumps it to the ground, where do you think the crypto money will go, now that bitcoin is nice and cheap?
@_date: 2018-12-03 16:31:05
You're cherry picking the bottom of the barrel, worst case scenario. You've bought in to the sterotype that all bitcoin investors over invested and are now crying through a living nightmare. You also assume everyone bought only since last year. Do you realize how shallow and over dramatic that perspective is??
For every one person who made such an irresponsible and dramatic all-in decision, I believe there are thousands who simply put a small 'risk portion' of their investments in bitcoin to have some skin in the game. Even now as prices are beat up, I have ZERO issue with averaging down using 5% of the money I put in stocks. I'm more than willing to take the risk without even an ounce of stress, because I believe that both bitcoin and the crypto market will be here for many years, and continue to experience radical highs and lows. I'm looking ahead a hell of a lot further than last year's high and this year's low. Some of us actually enjoy the risk, and enjoy following this entire space, so please stop painting us all with the same brush.

@_date: 2018-12-12 19:43:40
You do what you want with your money and FFS stop being so pompous as to think you can tell others what to do with theirs. Bitcoin has provided the best return on investment of any asset class in years. So if you're simply looking at this one past year, I'm sorry you got in and burned but many of us are aware that this is a bear market, and easily the best time to be buying.
I won't tell you how to use your money either, sound good? 
@_date: 2018-12-06 13:19:12
You're using it as it was intended to be used. It is people such as yourself that will eventually bring Bitcoin into fruition as a currency of the people. Anyone getting sour at you for that are probably not worth the concern. Most of us here are speculators, basically betting on a future where more people like yourself apply bitcoin to real-world usage in business and transactions.
@_date: 2018-12-15 14:20:51
That would be great. They haven't slowed progress and the market price has no more bearing on development when it's in a bear than it does when it's at ath. We need to stop all this judging bitcoin by its price on the market. The price is always going to be changing.
@_date: 2018-12-04 18:05:47
Bitcoin isn't going anywhere, there will always be trolls and also people who genuinely don't believe that Bitcoin will become the financial accounting system of the future (although, I suspect most of those people do not do a lot of homework on bitcoin's potential outside of click bait articles).  
So in the big picture a little criticism will only help make bitcoin stronger in the years to come because critics, as hated as they are, hold progress to a certain standard and challenge the curve.
@_date: 2018-12-08 16:40:12

I  agree and support the growing adoption of use too, but currently this is all market psychology. It does not need   utilization and adoption  to increase in price because the price has never been based on that - it's been based on buying and selling on the crypto market, and betting on a distant future where Bitcoin becomes more etched into society. Based on how far it's come, from a tiny project to a massive industry of miners, exchanges, apps, investment products, proposed ETF's, bakkt, etc., it would be foolish to think it's just goingto stop because the price on the market is low. If anything, that will eventually lead to more buyers picking up the beat up price.
@_date: 2019-05-18 01:48:29
I'd love a better invetment. I'm always looking fir a good investment, but even this past 5 months bitcoin has more than doubled. Nothing else I have found does that. And it's been doing it for years.

That's why he referenced the belief believe that it is possible for a sub-economy to emerge that is based on sound money. It's pretty common during early stages for many to dismiss the potential of things that go on to become staples of everyday life. Bitcoin's integration with society has already begun.

Ok now that I've stopped laughing, would you care to tell me which of the 195 countries in the world created bitcoin? Was it one of the 25 federal? You think one of them was stupid enough to intentionally create a global currency not tied to any one country or region? Considering Korea and China were the most involved for quite a while was it one of them? What about the whitepaper and the text instructions the devs were all sharing on their board to help miners configure the miner software when this all began? Were those developers working for the government too? Because many of them are still active. You just need to do one thing - THINK.
@_date: 2018-12-15 13:25:05
Nobody's giving up, and nothing's dying. Miners know what's coming. It's a market. Some years are great and some are crap. The efforts to portray bitcoin as dying are lame attempts to influence public sentiment. The trolls in this sub are really bad at what they do but still annoying. 
Right now while many are scared and many feel like it's a bad investment,  is in my opinion the very best time to buy. Last time things seemed this grim was the bottom of the last bear market. 
@_date: 2018-12-09 03:39:08
You have to understand that you sound exactly like many others who said same to me in 2015. Who knows, you might be right! I highly doubt it personally, as this emerging asset class is just getting going. 
If I lose my crypto money it doesn't phase me, if I needed it I'd have never put it in a high risk investment. This market has been a ton if fun for me, I really enjoy it. You should lighten up, do your thing and everyone else do that same. This is a community for bitcoin discussion. Don't take it so personally.
@_date: 2018-12-19 15:22:02
Of course it's speculation. Bitcoin's price is in discovery mode and will be for years. That's fine, it's what presents risk takers with massive opportunity.
@_date: 2018-12-23 17:01:14

Yesterday a good many of us wasted time trying to explain to you how bitcoin is a new entity and requires a new approach of thinking in terms of value.
Now you're here a day later saying the exact same shit with your 3 day old account. So either your life sucks balls and you like posting in Reddit subs for communities you have no support for or believe in. Or you're incredibly slow intellectually. Unless there's a third? Like maybe you're here for the good of mankind to try and argue crypto with people who actually have spent time learning about it? Or you want to save our souls?
@_date: 2018-12-06 12:52:12
Yes that applies to pretty much any risk or gamble. It is the extreme scenario. But buying Bitcoin when it's beat up and selling it during times like last December is the reason Bitcoin has produced better returns than almost any other investment in years. It's not really a mystery.
@_date: 2018-12-12 20:46:33
No clue. I just know that several times many of us have tried responding to you guys, and you in particular on a couple of your accounts. Tried the whole "talking about bitcoin" thing, but you simply revert back to repeating the exact same things. So clearly there is an agenda. 
I am interested in Bitcoin, and I am aware of the path this is all on, and it's not going away. The price thing? Well, this is a bear market, and who knows when it switches gears and reverts to bull. But are you trying to tell me that you are spending time in this sub for an asset and technology that you have nothing positive to say about, just because you enjoy writing pessimistic comments to a bitcoin community?
I barely have time to involve myself in the things I support and I can't imagine investing time on something I don't support, just to criticize it, unless I was being rewarded in some way. I mean would I go to church where a community of believers gathered, if I was not a believer myself? Just to tell them I believe they are wrong?? Would I expect a warm welcome? No! So, in short, this is why most people will assume your repeated visits to this sub are a result of paid trolling.

Is the bear going into hibernation for the winter? We may not see a bull "run" in the short term, but it looks like we may be on the verge of a new bull market anyway. It's a start! Perhaps a few more small drops to close the bear market, who knows.
@_date: 2018-12-29 03:10:49
You're incorrect.
1 - I never got excited (lol funny that you assume that from Reddit though, you kids crack me up)
2 - I specifically told you I am looking at 2025 before any serious traction
3 - I said 4 different times, that we are entering a bull "market" not a bull "run". Meaning we have found our bottom in my opinion. None of us know anything for a fact, it's all speculation. After the experiences I've had with  stocks previous years of bitcoin, this is all a game man. It means very little to me what the price does at this point, but I'd like to see bitcoin continue to grow after it's come this far.  
@_date: 2018-12-17 18:47:08

@_date: 2018-12-12 16:55:39
Until it's not. Then you sell at 3.6k, but it continues to go up and then you buy back in higher, losing all gains from the strategy you just mentioned. Very little beats averaging down in the long run.

When someone steals money...USD, Euro, whatever, does it impact the value of that money? If someone steals gold, does it impact the value of gold?

Lol I guess I'm both then. I probably should have sold more closer to top and bought it back now, but the problem is nobody ever knows for sure where the top or bottom is.

@_date: 2018-12-13 11:29:38
You can't just oversimplify things that way and then call it an issue. You need to stop listening to the run of the mill click bait article crap. Of all the criticism I've heard for bitcoin over the years, the issue of alts, forks and copycats has always been the most lazy critique. These copycats are a byproduct of any successful project or business because there's always going to be efforts to emulate that success. There's nothing to stop you from copying Amazon's business model, or Wallmart's, but will you have the support of buyers, sellers, infrastructure and the brand?
The people are what make Bitcoin what it has become. The hash power of thousands of  nodes that comprise the bitcoin network is what gives it value. The ten years of the network successfully running solid as a rock with 99.99% up time, without ever being hacked once gives Bitcoin an incredible head start. With networking, you need a solid  foundation to build upon and that ten years provides the confidence to developers that Bitcoin is not going away. The network value alone is incredible. More and more people are realizing this and there's no stopping what has been set in motion. I do hope you'll look into all this more. You'll understand that a simple whitepaper concept, which is what most alt coins are, has no network and no proven stability. These copycats are literally no threat to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-12-14 14:35:23

You sound like a child. People don't place high risk investments solely to get rich. High risk is a small portion of investments and this market is a blast to enjoy, so long as you don't overinvest and can stomach the highs and lows from one year to the next. 
@_date: 2018-12-01 21:45:32
Funny, I had this conversation with someone about 4 years ago and they sounded almost exactly like you - except they predicted it was just a long running fad and couldn't possibly go on any longer because the concept was flawed. Considering the definition of a fad usually refers to a few months - year, bitcoin sure is a hell of a long running fad!
In my opinion it will almost certainly become a viable store of value first. Currency is way down the road.
@_date: 2018-12-06 14:17:49
That's very odd, since you said yesterday that you felt the price should be less than a penny LMAO! I guess you don't have much commitment to your stance on things hey? Because I'm sure anyone who truly felt something was destined to be priced less than a penny would NOT be "in it for the price". You're hilarious.
@_date: 2018-12-14 20:09:14
I constantly say "in my opinion", and "nobody knows" and "Bitcoin has been thriving in terms of infrastructure growth and dev community", etc. I NEVER say anything regarding price as a fact, and I never use more than one account to up vote, down vote or post. So, if that's your idea of a troll, then it differs from mine.
@_date: 2018-12-06 20:35:43
Based on how it played out the last few times, I can honestly say that there's enough people sounding like they've lost hope to assume we are very close to the bottom. Just a few more trolls calling bitcoin dead and investors stupid and we're there! :)

Don't waste your time on this troll. Before you think about giving him another thought consider this: he posts all day long, has multiple accounts, but says he is against bitcoin. I'll say again... he gives up more effort and time to bitcoin ...the thing he apparently thinks is useless ... than anyone in this sub. Now why would any remotely sane individual do something like that? Also, my 10 year old nephew knows more about bitcoin from listening me talk about it the past 6 or 7 years than this troll could hope to comprehend. Ignore him and move on.

Seriously, bitcoin is an interest for me, not a retirement plan. I see it aligning well with a future digital society and I believe the best plan in terms of any investment is to average up and average down and wait at least 3-5 years. If I lost everything I put into it I would say 'oh well' and move on. It's a tiny fraction of my investments. However, I would love to see how Bitcoin advances over the coming decade and how it changes its shape in the financial world.

My thoughts as well. These hacks may be a downer, but they contribute to a more secure ecosystem of tomorrow. You break a lock, they make a stronger lock. That's how it's always been. Just don't store your crypto on exchanges until a viable service for insured crypto storage is available. Oh and people, please don't give me that bullshit about storage services being like banks, because they are nothing like banks if they only offer strictly storage. If you want adoption, it's common sense that large investments will require a commercially available storage solution. Nobody's going to want to use a store of value without a storage option that protects large amounts of investment from accidental loss. That's why Fidelity and these types of companies are critical for true mass adoption of store of value. As for currency use, we can always carry around smaller amounts in our own personal wallets.

Part 1. Bitcoin can and should be an alternative to existing curencies, is exceptionally new and will evolve to address many bottleneck and bandwidth issues. It will be used where it's application is best suited, particularly for online purchases at first.
Part 2. I'm not sure where you live but when internet goes down so does credit and debit card payments, and the temporary cash only signs go up. Fiat will continue to exist for many, many years. Bitcoin is an alternative, with incentives that will escalate in numbers going forward (push payment, low fees, investment/currency/value store,  deflationary, hybrid asset class).
Part 3. Nobody would be talking blockchain if not for bitcoin. Blockchain is the buzz word, dot com of the present day that companies associate themselves with to get short lived hype on the stock market. Bitcoin IS blockchain. Read a few thousand articles, listen to a few hundred podcasts, hear what the dev communities are saying. The hands down most efficient use of blockchain IS currency, and bitcoin has just about laid a stable enough of a foundation to really start building on now. Ten years under load, attacked, etc., now it has the credibility. Most other projects have not even passed the whitepaper stage. Maybe one day there will be a bitcoin 2.0  that eventually catches up to bitcoin's hash power and brand, but for now, this one is just getting started.
Part 4. Alt coins and ICOs are "mostly" an expected byproduct of Bitcoin. It's normal for success to be followed by attempts to emulate that success. It's human nature. I can copy Amazon's business model but that doesn't mean I'll have the resources and retailers jump on board with me.
Part 5. See above. Bitcoin and Fiat can co-exist, as they should for years to come.
You're welcome.

It's all speculation so the only thing would be a price that provides a balanced attraction to new buyers, miners, and holders. In other words,  not too low for miners and holders to stay engaged but low enough for new money to enter.

Bitcoin is not manipulatable, markets are. Huge difference. A while back someone asked how bitcoin has never been hacked when all these stories were floating around about stolen bitcoin. It's the same difference, bitcoin was not hacked, exchanges were. That's like blaming money that a bank was robbed. Bottom line, the kind of manipulation happening with markets will always be present  and regardless of the currencies we use, there will always be a small percentage of people with a large percentage of wealth, because some people are far more resourceful than others.
@_date: 2018-12-14 19:10:37
That's the speculation factor - low is whatever you perceive to be low. Based on this past year, it's quite low. Based this past decade it's quite high. As I said, the crypto market is  a lot of fun if you can handle the huge swings from one year to the next. But if you're putting money you can't afford to lose on a high risk investment, you can't blame that on Bitcoin.

@_date: 2018-12-18 14:33:53
Network value is directly correlated with its participants. There's computer networks and there's the general concept of network. If Bitcoin were a few years old, one could perhaps say that anyone could set up a decentralized network, but after 10 years and somewhere around 10,000 mining nodes to secure and maintain the transactions, good luck trying to emulate that kind of success. However, if someone does create a new network with the same security and participation then of course that network would also build value.
How much do you think a secure tamper-proof network maintained by perfect math and redundancy would be worth to a large business? What about Facebook's social network, how is it valued? - by participants. The inventor of Ethernet, Bob Metcalfe, created Metcalfe’s Law which states that a network’s value is proportional to the square of the number of its users. Networks need to have features that attract participants, and then the compounded value of the features plus the participants, creates total value. In Bitcoin's case, many add in the cost of production, or its POF feature which provides the exceptional security that Bitcoin has demonstrated for years.
Currently we are in the process of discovering value, and this will go on for decades in my opinion, as Bitcoin becomes more distributed and used as a container to store wealth. Because another argument, which makes a lot of sense, is that Bitcoin's value is directly proportional to the amount of money people store within it. The economists of the future definitely have their work cut out for them! Currently, they are having a hard time relating to value in this sense, because their entire concept of money and their careers, have been built upon the fiat system. We'll get there! One thing is for sure, Bitcoin is growing across the planet rapidly and will be here long after we are all dead.

We would still believe the earth was flat, which was indeed once a reality for everyone. We'd never have put man in space. We'd never be communicating on this platform via internet technology. None of these things were reality. Don't fall into the trap of thinking money can only function in the way your reality has been programmed. Have vision.
@_date: 2018-12-08 15:50:48
Well then criticize bitcoin. Explain where you think it falls short to eventually become adopted as an efficient placeholder of wealth like any other currency. We all know it's young and that the crypto market is speculation and not matured yet. That has nothing to do with how well bitcoin can serve as a currency. The price is rotating bull and bear market cycles because we're all speculating on the future use and as a market, there will be profit taking and hyped up prices etc. 
But simply insulting buyers and saying bitcoin is dead provides zero value to this sub. The value of a bitcoin is directly correlated to how much value people choose to hold in it, and many people believe that it will continue to increase as it has been doing over the past decade as it's gone from pennies to thousands. To assume that's going to stop now just because the crypto market is in a bear period is shallow thinking.

A new POS terminal? No, think bigger. Much bigger, and much further into the future. As I said in another comment, what we're talking about is currency, and not a new payment platform for an existing currency. This means multiple generations at the very minimum. We are programmed to use fiat from a very early age. It's even how many children learn to count and manipulate numbers. Currency is something that is embedded into the very fabric of society and to think we can reshape it in 10 years is radical and irrational. POS systems will slowly evolve and be reshaped over the years, just as have already been. Evolution is ongoing and never stops.

If quantum computers go mainstream, I'd think that the nodes on the bitcoin network would be quantum machines and the algorithm would be updated to implement quantum computing. One of the great things about bitcoin is that its hash power is increased as the machines rumming the mining software are upgraded over time. 
Oh and also, I'd think we'd have many other security issues if it happened in the way you're implying.
@_date: 2018-12-07 04:55:22
Be consistent with what I said. Of course buying it low is better than holding it low, and so is averaging down.  But if you hold through a bear market and sell higher it beats selling at a loss. Maybe this time will not cycle through to another bull, but this is a very real market now and I'd think this keeps going on for a long long time.

Anyone on her whining and complaining didn't listen. It's going to be attractive at a low price, and there's no shortage of high risk investors who are willing to put money in the game for the next round. No need for drama, it's the crypto market and this is what it does.

@_date: 2018-12-13 17:54:50
No, you're not basing your perspective on an understanding of what Bitcoin actually is. I'd suggest a few books, perhaps "The Bitcoin Standard" to start. I am not saying you are wrong or right, but you are not understanding the concept of hash power and network nodes - and how this transfers to use as a currency. 
Bitcoin is a ledger, shared among thousands of computers who each have an exact copy of that ledger. The ledger records how many 'placeholders' (Bitcoin) or portion of a placeholder (Satoshi) you changed from one wallet address to another, which are transactions. It's an accounting system, stored on a global database. The math, decentralized tamper proof ledger, global alignment, and redundancy is where the value is. I get your coming at this with MySpace and Yahoo examples, and I have worked in IT and Network Security for almost 20 years, so I have experienced these shifts first hand. Bitcoin is NOTHING like those examples. Consider for example, the Lindy effect. Technology comes in many forms, and the Bitcoin network is in no danger of being replaced by a 'Bitcoin 2.0' until long after you and I are dead and gone. 
The main take away I'd like for you to grasp, is that it does not matter how many forks or copycats are created, because they would have to get thousands of miners worldwide to jump in the game, build a brand and eventually be considered as a stable network to hold wealth and desired by people all over the globe. A Bloomberg analyst recently put it best - the additional coins are competition, but will eventually be purged and this will strengthen Bitcoin in the long run as those multiple low priced coins see the money flow back into BTC.

There is absolutely positively without any doubt NO way to know where the price will go. If you believe in a future where more people own bitcoin and potentially use it as a currency, store of value etc., then it makes no difference if you bought at 3500 or 4k. Personally, after the rollercoaster ride of the past few years, none of the current price movement makes a lot of difference unless you're trading daily. Anything under 6k is a good entry point if you're looking long term.

Calm down, you're going to hurt yourself. Saying bitcoin was a means to speculate is actually pretty insulting to the people who got the ball rolling on all this.
The more people that own it, with fixed supply, the more valuable it will become. Then just like digging shiny rocks out of the ground back before we had the internet to facilitate transfer, bitcoin can easily become a newer, more accountable, easier to exchange place holder and far better suited to a digital age. Then, in time don't worry - It will likely get to be the currency it can be but it will be generations from now.

I guess you are committed to living in your bubble, and if that contributed to your happiness I say go for it. Just know that nobody takes price predictions seriously, not even when thy come from the big boys. It doesn't matter that I don't comprehend why you place such importance on making a lucky guess. It doesn't make you money, and since this is not your real name, it doesn't add any credibility to your reputation. But again ... if such a tiny accomplishment makes you fulfilled, who am I to rain on your parade right?
@_date: 2018-12-20 16:22:25
That about sums up your vocabulary. I bet you say that every time Reddit bans one of your useless user accounts. What's this now? The 15th? 16th troll account you've created?
@_date: 2018-12-06 01:09:06
I assure you that's not just this past year. There was two years of bear 3 years back and it was brutal. But those of us that waited it out were well rewarded. If you think this time is different that's your choice and you should not buy in. I'll buy in for years because from my experience with bitcoin, this can go on for a long time to come. Don't try and time big players moves, just go along for the ride and occassionally take profits. 
But to address your claim, past bear markets went on for years and every single time people said exactly what you said, calling the last participants earky adopters. That's what "we" are to the buyers of 2022 :)
@_date: 2018-12-05 17:33:53
Then the little guys can jump back in with lower difficulty again. I'd start mining again and I know plenty of others who'd do the same. That would actually be amazing. Stop teasing!!!
@_date: 2018-12-06 01:53:20
Sounds about right. Currency used to take thousands of years to adopt fully, then hundreds. I'd say at least several generations, many upgrades and a few updates in complacent perspectives and we'll get there no problem. This is currency we're talking about, not a new PS4 game. It's GOT to take years. Oh, and "only" 3700? Are you mad? It went from pennies to thousands in 10 years, what in the hell do you want??!

I was following it when it was a very small project used only by true enthusiasts. A few close friends of mind mined it on their home built PCs. I'm sure you're just pretending to be void of information to troll on here. I've been in this space for a long time, and I've heard many silly arguments, but you're just acting like you're a moron. So, I'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt and assume you're not really this stupid.

It's just stress free. Buy when you have the money to spare and forget about it.  In 5 years you will have considerably more. That has been true and I believe it will remain. You can make more trading and you can also lose more. Personally I don't think it's worth the stress so I am long term.

Give it time, and it will make more sense. Look at the explosive growth in demand in only 10 years. All coins won't be mined until 2140. If this much growth has occured in 10 years, imagine in another 10, or another 25 years.

@_date: 2018-12-13 18:04:10
Bitcoin in long term looks very strong. If you're concerned about short term though? It could go lower. Remember that typically, Bitcoin's bear market lows are usually only no higher than twice the previous cycle's peak. That may sound bleak, since the previous cycle peak was only 1100ish. BUT ... keeping that in mind, imagine 20k being the next cycle's 'low'. Does that make waiting up to 4 or 5 years worth it? Now it could take a year or 5 years, NOBODY knows. But there is a very positive upside to all this for anyone with patience who understands how Bitcoin is shifting more and more into mainstream culture and society.

@_date: 2018-12-28 15:22:57
It's about aligning with the wants, needs and convenience of a digital society. To think that future generations will prefer to dig shiny rocks out of the ground over Bitcoin seems backwards and ludicrous. There was no digital exchange or internet when gold was chosen as a value store. The world has changed and just like everything else has evolved so too, will currency. 
We can agree to disagree and see what happens. 
@_date: 2018-12-05 01:16:06
100% irrelevant. Crypto market speculation and trading on exchanges has ZERO effect on the accuracy and "superior accounting" of Bitcoin. If you place a wager on the price of a Mercedes or a Rolex, it doesn't make those products any less superior to other vehicles and watches. It's difficult to believe that you even just said that as though you believe bots on an exchange have anything to do with the accounting accuracy of Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-12-14 02:40:37

Bitcoin needs useful constructive criticism to challenge its development. This has been beneficial to all emerging technologies, particularly during the first few decades of growth. 
So why can't we get some quality criticism in this sub? Why are we stuck with a handful of kiddies with multiple accounts spamming their ignorant schoolyard digs? Our sub has become riddled with highschool drop out trolls with the intellect of larva, spamming that bitcoin is worth zero. They have no knowledge of economics, and even less of technology. Soon they will be talking to themselves via their own multiple accounts, but bitcoin will continue to thrive as it has for a decade.

I have never made price predictions. I have simply answered the odd tech question on here and explained why I see Bitcoin as a global ledger of accounting for financial transactions of the future. Price predictions are noise in the background while real tech is being developed. 
Your comments regarding (autistic or have aspergers) again shows your lack of couth and is consistant with your use of the word retarded. It seems you are fixated on homosexuality and disease.

It can't be used directly as a currency until the volatility mitigates, which will take years. But it is still syncing with society and culture in many ways. Currently, buying and selling indicates an active market and in no way reflects any issues with Bitcoin. This is what the crypto market is going to do for a long time until we graduate past speculation.

Right now? Good luck with that. They're a mess and cash is pointless there as they scramble to use cards for everything. It would be chaos!! But for now, most things there are still valued in bolivars and you'd still be paying back the equivalent amount of bitcoin to equal the amount of bolivars to my understanding. So as I said, it would be chaos. Even with the new bolovar or the interbanex system, you're still valuing things there in traditional currency and thus it's the equivalent amount of bitcoin that you would pay.
@_date: 2019-05-23 19:17:21

You don't need to criticize people who like placing a little bet on the future. Bitcoin is still here and your perspective is getting weaker every year that Bitcoin continues to exist. 
@_date: 2019-05-17 15:39:44
Nobody knows these things man. Not even the smartest of the bunch knows the answer. We only know that bitcoin has been increasing in development and price for years. Play long game, DCA, and either hold long or sell in a few years or so and take a profit you're happy with. Remember, bitcoin was 3200 in December. It's not down, it's up. Long game has always won in this space. Anyone knows the 20k spike in 2017 shouldn't determine the entire past decade. There will always be trolls trying to scare the noobs away but trolls are full of shit.
@_date: 2018-12-14 20:01:07
So Bitcoin hurt you hey? Look, the whole bag holder only applies to times of beaten up prices. Fear Uncertainty and Doubt was going around even when the hype was on overdrive and the price was speculated to 20K. FUD exists not just to get people to sell, but to draw reader in to articles and generate ad revenue via traffic. Nobody likes a happy story and statistics show that FUD articles get more traffic.
@_date: 2018-12-12 13:58:23
I have multiple people every day asking if the price is going any lower because they are waiting to buy low. Just like stocks...nobody gives a shit about what happened last go around. If anything it shows them how high this thing can ramp up. Only difference is each bull run has people who learned from the last one, and get out with profits. It's a market and market mentality applies.
@_date: 2018-12-16 01:37:28
We need more info. Depends on how long we've been holding the bags. Any bags held long enough are now many X what we paid, in fact we can occasionally sell a few to install a full smart home system, and usually tip guys like you for delivering all the gear to the right door.

Try harder. While you talk yourself with multiple accounts, the only reality is your desperation. Mods just want to keel this kind of bullshit cleaned up in Reddit, they don't give a crap what the market price of bitcoin is. Bitcoin has not failed as a currency because it will take generations to succeed as a currency. Anyone with half a clue understands that. Let's just call everything failed before it gets off the ground. 10 years..pffft, this is just barely started troll. As I said, if you're going to troll...you need to get educated and try harder.

You don't need to agree with them all, or any of them for that matter. I've been investing for 20 years and I'm sorry but nothing has come remotely close to Bitcoin bull runs. Do I put a great deal of money in Bitcoin? Of course not! But I enjoy this market. It's my money and my time and my opinion. You really should not carry so much weight in what I or anyone else express on here. It's all speculation and will be for a very long time. There's far bigger things in life to stress out over. Oh and yes, 2025 is a year I have set in my head for when Bitcoin will really be syncing with the social collective, and I've been saying that for years. I might be wrong, but I have no idea why that statement would lead you to think I'm trolling! Hey man, all the best to you and your investments.

For the remainder of your life, that house will be valued in fiat, the equivalent amount of which in bitcoin is what you'll pay back.

And by then....they'll figure it out :).

Anyone criticizing this has clearly not looked at the prices because it's spot on.
@_date: 2018-12-08 17:07:04
Look, the current volatility is the result of one thing: speculation. We're all betting on how this will play out but nobody can predict the future. So it's a young, volatile market in the crypto space. Play at your own risk and be aware of the extreme volatility. It's anyone's own money to do with what they like. If you plan to spend your time trying to criticize people for what they believe, or support or how they spend a small portion of money they're will to place in a high risk investment, you've got your work cut out for you.

Faketoshi found a loophole via copyright laws. That's it, nothing more. US Government won't stop bitcoin, it's a global entity and not tied to any one region or country. I guess they could shut down the internet lol. All the governments on the planet would have to ban together to stop bitcoin, and with many of them supporting bitcoin, along with the massive revenue it generates, that's never going to happen.
@_date: 2018-12-08 18:23:42
What you do with you money is your business. Invest in crypto or avoid it like the plague. Just remember that this is a market. Bitcoin may be a new emerging asset class, but this is still a market.
Always keep in mind: The most gains are made by those who buy in a bear market. That will NEVER change. The fact that thousands bought at 15-20k only to lose 85%, and now when it's much cheaper people are panicked and afraid to buy is baffling to anyone that has spent 10-20 years or more on markets. Avoid the noise and keep perspective.

@_date: 2018-12-07 19:23:08
Yes, and one might even say that's worse than gambling. That would have been a terrible decision and bitcoin is not to blame. Anyone doing something like that would have most likely lost the money elsewhere. 
@_date: 2018-12-04 22:40:56
Well that will happen too, that's a given. No the past year was the result of obvious speculation which was put into overdrive by hype and fomo. The price got ahead of itself and there was an obvious and predictable pullback. That's been the storyline for bitcoin for years and if bitcoin is worth 100k one day, I'd bet there will be several more bull markets followed by bear along the way. It doesn't change the fact that bitcoin provides superior accounting. It represents the value being held in it collectively and if masive selling occurs then the price will drop. There will be plenty of years to come for people to buy low and sell high before volatility dissapears.

You may be on to something there. There's not a lot of safe haven places to put money in these days. I'm still OK with Bitcoin in the long term but anyone looking for short term growth doesn't have a lot of options right now.
@_date: 2018-12-29 03:18:25


Currently, there's nothing in it for them in terms of instant gratification. Once you can clearly see what's in it for them, it will be far too late to take advantage of the potential opportunity of accumulating any amount of bitcoin. The whole point of holding on to any amount of bitcoin is that you hope it increases in value with future increased adoption of use or use as a store of value. Otherwise people would be spending it and not holding it.  
Once enough people own it, exchanging it as a currency will make far more sense.
@_date: 2018-12-13 01:37:29
Litecoin was created to supplement bitcoin and work together with bitcoin in the same ecosystem. The concept was litecoin is to bitcoin as silver is to gold.
There's really very little to criticize about Litecoin. I think it simply got lost in the noise with all these flashy whitepaper alts and ICO's. When the hype was in full swing, litecoin was a very efficient and fast way of converting from one exchange to another, and transfers on the Litecoin network were always dependable.
Off-chain atomic swaps powered on LN seemed promising but the whole Litepay mess didn't do the coin any favors. If Bitcoin starts to becomes a mass adopted store of value within the next few decades (which I think is inevitable), I still see the litcoin concept working as long as both continue to get upgraded going forward.

Naw, it has an abundance of value for multiple reasons I've expressed on this sub more times than I care to count. Read a few books, do some research on the network value and the concept of Bitcoin - it is not supposed to have value as a product or company. If you truly understand why it's grown from pennies to thousands, and if you truly understand why it's still here after ten years of thriving in the most hostile environment, even after Mt Gox where EVERYONE assumed it was gone forever - then, and only then can you form an educated perspective.

It's a network not an iPad. The network will be vastly improved with layers and sidechains and who knows what else.

Tim has always been ahead of the curve and his instincts to jump on future innovation has served him well.
Hey, here is a great video interviewing non-crypto owners and how they view Bitcoin. I think it shows the huge potential of how much saturation is left in terms of future growth. If we can hit 20k with such a small % of potential participants, imagine what we can reach once more people jump on board.
@_date: 2018-12-17 03:20:22
You're still thinking based on what is currently in place. Nothing can evolve if that were how everyone approached change. Why should bitcoin have to replace anything? Why can't it be integrated into the existing system with it's own infrastructure and on/ramps? Hint...this is already happening :)
Fiat is liked to countries and regions, bitcoin is global and tamper proof. Think of the endless implementations.
@_date: 2018-12-14 14:03:57
It's a market, and currently the prices are beat up. So if you like buying lows now that it's reasonable to assume most selling has been exhausted, then why not be optimistic? Buy/average down in a bear market, then sell later during a bull market. Bitcoin isn't going away and it doesn't care what we speculate its price to be. It is still the tech it was when we were trading it at 20k. In fact, it's constantly being developed and will continue to be moving forward so unless you're only focusing on this one past year, what's there to be pessimistic about? I'm pretty optimistic when I get anything at a lower price :).

Once it teaches that point the investment opportunity will be much less. Now is the time to accumulate, not once it reaches mass adoption. Value store on place of gold will occur long before currency use in my opinion.

That's it? You just said nothing, ziltch. Currency can't mature in 10 years, it takes generations, and I'm sure you know that. The volatility is very expected as the price discovery process will be ongoing for many years to come. This is something we all have to accept, whether for, or against bitcoin as a currency for future generations.
I think you're confusing bitcoin for a product or company share that produces a product or service, which explains your trying to understand it. An empty bank account has more value as you deposit money into it. How you value the bank account as a service to hold your money,  and any conveniences it brings you is subjective. It's a slow process but as newer generations in a digtial society come online, bitcoin has a very strong chance of being their preffered choice, particularly for internet purchases. The crypto market also provides an investment space far more aligned with a digital age. 
Think future, not present. Anyone can condemn current performance as a failure if you don't allow time for success. If we all did that, we'd have none of today's tech, some of which took hundreds of years to become mainstream.

All in due time. Big players can move price until volume and number of participants grows and the market matures.

I don't think any intelligent person doubts that Bitcoin's price on the crypto market will catch up to the  infrastructure growth and continue to rise. But don't count on this moon  that everyone talks of happening quickly. The reastic view is that it will continue to grow over the next ten years as it has been doing. Then, if this fast rising moon happens soon, it will be a bonus. Setting expectation is mitigating disappointment.

Anyone that felt as convinced as you claim to be that bitcoin is worthless would not spend this much time and effort on bitcoin. You're fooling nobody. I've tried talking with you on several occasions about the pros and cons, the flaws and benefits, etc. You just go around in circles because you have no interest in exploring bitcoin in depth.

Yes, well you're half right. The people in Vegas don't have even bigger morons with holier than thou attitudes critizing their choice to have a little fun with money they can afford to risk.
I've never put more money in crypto than I was willing to lose, and unlike my other investments I get a rush from it, and enjoy it.
Now if you don't, and it's not for you, then I'm fairly certain none of us really care.
So yeah, crypto market, vegas, penny stocks, horse racing, poker, and whatever the hell else a person wants to enjoy should not be grounds to call them a moron. In fact that sounds like the words of a miserable human being who is reflecting some crappy life of their own. I work quite hard and invested quite strategically over the years to have disposable income to enjoy the crypto market, travel the world, try new things and not stress over the money. So while you struggle to get your pompous head out of your ass, I'll gladly take my profits from the next bullrun and see a great show in Vegas.

Yeah, it can be discouraging if you're counting on a certain price movement for sure. The thing is though, when it was soaring last year it was not rational to expect it to keep going up, and now, it is not rational to expect it to keep going down. Whether it was 3200 or if it drops back lower nobody can know, but it will almost certainly go back up.

I know plenty of people invested in Bitcoin, and not one of them feels like "teaching the whole world a lesson." That's an insane thing to think.

One Bcash will probably consume the other through cannibalization, but either way, Bitcoin can take this hit easily. Considering that regardless of all other factors, we can all agree that the Bcash feud definitely contributed to this new low in the Bitcoin price. I know it's a bear market, but that whole mess strengthened the blow to Bitcoin's price. So we may see a fast Bitcoin price recovery once these two versions of BCash have finished their chest thumping.

Of course, I realize that. But I didn't post it then. To be fair these guys have been profiting constantly both trading and shorting.

Banks are not the enemy and bank investment won't save bitcoin, but institutional investment could inflate the price again - due to the compounding of additional buying and the lift in public sentiment such news would trigger. Banks are not running scared, and they are not trying to tear down bitcoin. Banks are a collective of people in controlling positions and are a mammoth compared to the crypto market. Bitcoin can succeed but as a value store first. This must take years. Once you own enough of it, you can start to spend it, but again this is literally generations away. For now, we have a speculative market where everyone wants to place their bets and you know what? It's OK. Because no publicity is bad publicity and some of the biggest innovations on the planet were nurtured and developed while first utilized in the porn, defense, gambling and gaming industries. The fact that we get a new version of the market out of this is a bonus in my mind. It gives people something to focus on while the dev team do their job. 
Bitcoin can run WITH FIAT and banks can learn to benefit from it (they already have).

@_date: 2018-12-21 01:24:37
It will stay cyclical for another few phases but unlikely to always be that way because less and less of that "should" happen once bitcoin is further distributed. The buys and sells will be ongoing, and bitcoin will be constantly changing hands. The price would have to be a lot higher as we measure more and more in satoshi, and the price movement would become more like stock price movement. 
@_date: 2018-12-07 20:28:51

3200 felt like bottom, the sentiment was similar to 2015, selling was fatigued and the bcash mess was over. Nobody can say with crypto, but I think 3200 was bottom. The big players trigger bull markets and they also trigger sell-offs. This could be the beginning of another bull market ..not bull 'run', but it may be slowly up from here. We'll find out soon enough!

You are 100% correct, and while most people know this, it's very difficult for many people to see ahead. The adoption of Bitcoin is already on course and outside of total internet collapse, nothing can stop it. It's a very slow process though and many will doubt it because they are programmed to only see currency in one shape. In terms of the crypto market, there's a lot of psychological factors to consider. When everyone starts to see what's happening, then there will be no more opportunity to profit from the speculation, so for now I'm happy to buy at low prices :). It will be at least another generation before any real movement in adoption, so we may get a few more big run ups and strong corrections before the price starts to stabilize.

Considering each bull market topped at an average of 10X the previous one, and we haven't come even remotely close to market saturation, I'd say the next one will be the one that makes bitcoin become 'real' to the skeptics.

It's just short term mindset, not a lot you can do to convince newcomers to the space. If they only bought in last year for the first time, this would feel like the end.

@_date: 2018-12-06 23:55:07
People get so caught up in the market and the price they forget that bitcoin doesn't die because the price is down. The price dropped because it's a speculative market and it's going to be in bull and bear cycles for as long as there is speculation, buying and selling. If anyone is all stressed out over the price then they obviously over invested and didn't listen to everyone who has been saying only invest in crypto if you have the stomach for the volatility of extreme highs and lows. It's not like this is news, it's been this way for years.

Semantics. You can invest your time, effort or money in hopes to get a return. If you put a thousand dollars in bitcoin 3 or 4 years ago, you would have made a great return, and the vast majority would call that an investment. When an ETF for bitcoin is approved do you think they'll call it an investment product? Of course they will. Bitcoin is a hybrid entity.

It's already surpassed 10k, and yes it will easily hit it again. Here's the thing -  The market price of Bitcoin got way over hyped and flew ahead of itself, so as would happen in any situation like this, we got a typical pullback.

Bitcoin as a technology has been growing for ten years and the dev team are not slowing down because of it's price on the speculative crypto market. That's just the process of discovering how people will value  it. If it is identified as a placeholder for value then those rules of economics you refer to align quite well.
Anything can be currency if people collectively agree that it is. Considering how quickly bitcoin is growing, you'd have to be blind to not see that it is going to continue. The world is ready for a currency that fits into a digital society. Bitcoin has been labeled as the internet of money and it's not about how valuable the 1s and 0s are as binary code, but rather how many people are willing to use bitcoin as a new accounting system to track wealth.

Statistical fact...stock trading, specifically day trading has a 3.5% to 4.5% success rate. And that's stocks.

Well I have always worked with IT and networking, and was involved then - it felt the same. If you invested 5k and lost 85% in 2014 or 2018, it's the same loss. And let me tell you, the negativity and bad reputation caused by Mt. Gox dwarfs the negativity of today. If Bitcoin survived ...and thrived after that, I believe it can survive whatever gets thrown at it. Well, aside from a catastrophic technical failure of course.
The main point is to always consider Bitcoin as currency, is a tiny infant just starting to grow, because a currency takes many generations to implement into society. But as a tech, it's been developing for 10 years, and if something has been around and growing for 10 years, it's WAY past the 'fad' stage. It's here to stay. Familiarize yourself with the Lindy effect, for a deeper dive into that.

Exactly. You either believe bitcoin will continue to grow and want to be in front of that potential gain in your investment or you don't think it's worth the risk and you avoid it. To each their own.

It's going up with profit taking along the way. It was 3200 a very short time ago. You can't look at bitcoin with a narrow lens. There are very large players at work here. They sell large amounts, encouraging people like you to panic sell, then they buy back larger amounts at the lower price. Rinse and repeat. Until this market matures over the next several years, it's likely they will continue to do so up to the point when there are too many participants for their actions to move the price. The holder still gets his gains if you just DCA and sell at a profit you're happy with.... or hold for years.
