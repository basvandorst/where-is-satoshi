Nah mate I made it at work while I should have been working on other stuff.

Bitcoin is in a bit of a weird state for me right now.
On one hand it's the face of cryptocurrency, whether anyone likes it or not.
On the other hand there are other cryptocurrencies that do what bitcoin does but better, the only difference is how adopted bitcoin has become. I'm genuinely wondering if Bitcoin's household name status is enough to keep it top dog, or if one of the smaller coins will overtake it in due time.
Either way it's going to keep being a wild ride.

Aight mate, whatever you say. You clearly came here for a fight but if you're just going to double back and make vague statements like "Technical analysis is much more than just Head and Shoulders" when everyone fucking knows that and I even eluded to it in my own post, there isn't much to say here. 
I'd be extremely surprised if a 19 year old college freshmen has done much investing but who knows, maybe you're the next Warren Buffet. I wish you the best either way as a future investor.
As a Redditor though you're a bit of a cunt.

The image is accredited to Dr. Jean-Paul from Hofstra University.
He made it in 2008 to describe economic bubbles.
Whether or not you think it's accurate and useful is up to you.

Aight mate.
First off, I said that it was unlikely as fuck because it is. 
Secondly,  head and shoulders is a moderately known technical analysis pattern for stocks. Whether or not you put any faith in technical analysis is up to you, and most traders will tell you different things. 
Thirdly, fuck off ya uppidy first year college student. You didn't even bother to Google it before you called it imaginary.

Well, you could hope that this downward spike is the start of a reverse head and shoulders and it's the start of a breakthrough to $20k+, but it's a hell of a longshot.

I was saying that back at 19k.
Now it's at 12k in a month. 
I don't fully understand your statement. Bitcoin, until its adoption picks up, is a speculative investment. It has all the indicators of being in a massive bubble. I'm not saying is definitely going to keep going down, but I sure as shit wouldn't doubt it, not when everyone and their grandmother knows about it.

With the exception that BTC now has mass media attention and has become well known enough the common layman knows about it.
I'm not saying BTC is dead but to not accept the fact that this very well could be a bubble is simply denial.

No problem man.
