There are few things you can do:
1. In the dispute state that it was a digital good, PayPal does not approve disputes with digital good. They will cancel the dispute and the only option he will have is to chargeback (And you will be able to lawsuit him for that).
2. When you sell them you tell the buyer to open a dispute and close them afterwards, and that you will send the bitcoin after he does that. 
Both methods are not even close to 100%, but will help in some cases.

It's a shame you have no understanding of the situation.
If you would like to hear more, private channels will be better, As the conflict is not the topic here.

I don't think so.
People already have their mining hardware. as long as they don't lose money they will continue to mine.
And there is alot of Pre-Orders going through so Bitcoin price is probably hurting the miners the most.

You Have to pick a Restaurant, do a full order and then fill the address, and you will have the option to pay in Bitcoin.
