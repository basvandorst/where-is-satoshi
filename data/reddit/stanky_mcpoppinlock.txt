Here's a good idea:
When the bottom drops out of your ideal "hoarding" scenario, remember this post and the following statement, "If something has the name Mises in it, avoid it as a source of information because it is both lacking in scientific knowledge and general logic."

Seems to work pretty well for most of the world. Consumers have fraud protection, accounts have insurance, value remains mostly stable compared to all previous attempts at currency, and it is ubiquitous.
If a person sends money to the wrong account with traditional banking methods, there is a remedy to the situation. With bitcoin, there isn't. So who's working on a solution to this problem, as I always see it listed as a "[feature](
@_date: 2014-09-08 18:23:54
Except you can't claim it's extremely common, as I don't think there's any verifiable data on this, and the set of emails sent every day is so much more massive than the set of bitcoin transactions between two unique parties.

"Studying economics in my spare time" is like saying "studying chaos theory in my spare time" or "studying quantum mechanics in my spare time" or "studying evolutionary biology in my spare time".
And Austrian economics is like the Lamarckism of economics. At best it's a political tool of neoliberal entities. At worst it's a brand of philosophy built on false premises.

Yes, because I am a moron, like this guy.
Anyone who says anything bad around here about bitcoin (pointing out obvious flaws in the reasoning behind it) is called a troll. Don't even pretend like you guys are actually not just trying to actively create an echo chamber.
The weakest willed people rely on the type of defense you guys use against "trolls" (trolls being used loosely, here, based on what you deem inappropriate for hyping your internet money/goods/whatever it is that's fashionable amongst the neckbear demo at the time).

Perhaps you mean "investment banking".
The other types of banking are pretty legit. Like, you know, bank accounts and debit cards and stuff.

Dude, no one calls themselves those terms, at least not if they want to be taken seriously. That's all politics. Please stop talking.

So who is this "they" you speak of if not a centralized authority on what is and is not "fraud", and how will "they" implement it in a manner that is any different than "regulation"?

I don't see what was stupid about this decision. Or why you would claim that they also didn't defeat the Germans. The Russians, US, Britain, and resistance forces in Germany played the largest roles.
And below, I see a comment saying something like, "US leaders were smart about when they joined." Well, no shit, we knew there'd be a fight in the Pacific eventually, too, so why would you over-commit to Europe when Russia has millions of people they're willing to throw at Germany? No reason to waste your own people when someone else is already doing it for you.

Where is this reduction in friction? From only using bitcoin? Do you realize that, unless massive changes to it happen that no one I have ever heard of is working on, bitcoin has far more friction than the current monetary system?
I guess you could argue that if EVERYONE used it, it would be low(ish) friction, but I don't see this.
As for me, the general economic theories I have read that support my view are those revolving around fractional reserve banking (I know, evil). The increased lending power has made economies explode, as those who need capital can access it, and this increases overall economic growth and production power. It has pretty much allowed the modern world to exist, because with it, the amount of available capital to be used towards actual production increases (not just some BS money market stuff that provides "returns" for investors, but actual businesses getting far more capital than otherwise could exist), thus, actual production increases - as long as returns on the investment outweigh debt costs... which are fairly negligible, since [interest rates are typically quite low]( except in extremely poor economic times (see: the early 1980s USA).
It seriously encourages long term investment in physical capital.
I mean, let's look at what money market funds are:


Less than one year? Garbage investment for economies. It's like financial crack. Short term investment is why we are in the financial mess we are in today.
Now, equities can be good, given the right context. But, it still doesn't show itself to be a magic bullet. For instance, how would we have the sheer amount of business activity available to have a healthy equities trading market if large firms can't access large amounts of capital when needed? If all money is a fixed amount and cannot fluctuate with the economy? That's crazy dude!
Now, I will admit, the current system can be (and has been) abused from time to time, and it allows firms to exist when they otherwise should have failed. There is a possible moral hazard with easy lending towards large firms - see the bank bailout, for instance. A precedent has been set that they're so large we will cover their poor investment strategies, or poor financial instrument construction. So that is no good in that case. BUT, we can't just write the whole thing off and expect bitcoin to fix it. You need proper regulation that prevents firms from creating excessively risky financial instruments (like derivatives based off of "liar's loans", for instance), OR you need regulation that will hold firms more accountable in explaining how their instruments are created, or something like that.


I don't buy this, though. Cross-border capital flows will only increase for the smaller types - people sending money to other people. Large firms already easily send large amounts across borders.
Furthermore, I don't know if it's necessarily even good to let small amounts flow easily, as every small-time hopeful arbitrageur will try predicting currency fluctuations and develop some kind of trading schemes like that, possibly exacerbating economic crisis in countries having a difficult time (but this would require probably a PhD dissertation to make the case for, so I am not equipped to deal with that  at the moment in a reddit post).

See? You still can't address my points in a conversation, which means for all your supposed "first hand professional experience" (whatever that is, and why it is of relevance is still up for debate - for all I know you flip burgers, although it appears you are a "CPA" according to your username, which is hilarious, because all accountants actually are are adding machines who know nothing about any economic theory), you still can't efficiently and effectively put into words your argument against my points.
Not even so much as a debate against my point that short term investment is worse than long term investment. No direct comparison of "friction" of the currencies in question. No numbers disputing my view on small remittances being a major player versus large firms transferring funds internationally in comparison. You didn't even give me the obligatory pseudo-documentaries that hate (and misrepresent, for political reasons) fractional reserve banking (I'm looking at you, Zeitgeist).
You gave one source and it's a working paper from the IMF, and honestly, unless it's just the actual data they collect itself, I am leery of listening to the IMF on anything, as they're a pretty biased source.

Because the B's doing the 2 part aren't interested in the B2B use of it, as there isn't much. They are more interested in the free marketing that B2C gives them with a minimal cost. Marketing isn't cheap, and this is cheap marketing to the bitcoin demo.

I'm not "committing" any "fraud", I'm a member of both "communities" as I have posted in both for a pretty long time.
The point is, you're asking for a centralized source to determine what is and is not fraud, and to silence others based on their arbitrary definition of fraud. "Regulations" sound familiar?

It's either
1. Cognitive dissonance (I hate having my bank account info online in case of fraud! So let's use a currency that has historically had fraud issues and no fraud protection, unlike using my debit card!)
2. A false statement made to continue helping pump cryptocurrencies.
3. Because all they do is buy illegal shit online and they just don't want to come out and say it (understandable, as many things SHOULD be legal... Although the sad part of bitcoin is you don't know if they're supporting it because they just like to smoke a little weed, or if they like to jerk it to naked kids).

Well, according to [Reuben (and by extension, Gürerk et al]( as they proposed this from their study on the relevant slide in this presentation), people choose to align themselves into societies that punish those who don't cooperate for the general good of the population. This is done experimentally in a lab setting where a "public goods game" is played, which allows for investment, returns, and the ability to punish others (at a cost to both the punished and the punisher).

Well, spending now would technically help it not become worthless, as all the people hoarding it are helping it become worthless by inflating the value which will eventually end in a bubble and crash - and if it keeps bubbling and crashing, no one will ever seriously use it for anything but a speculative way to try to make money by trading back and forth between fiat and bitcoin.
You've got some short-sightedness over here despite all the claims of concerns of "the long term".

@_date: 2014-09-07 02:11:03
Yes. And hoarding doesn't actually make it DO anything. You want it to be this "currency", yet you keep treating it like a speculative good, and hoarding just causes weird price fluctuations that no business would tolerate for long. Nobody is going to keep buying imaginary speculative goods for very long, and the hype train is losing steam now. Enough bubbles and crashes and eventually people leave the market as it's a pointless investment and provides worse returns than other more tangible assets. And absolutely no actual investors are going to approach bitcoin unless they have inside information about large market makers, or unless they want to do so for the PR concerning the demographic that makes up bitcoin evangelists.
I'd go back to economics 101, but those classes are pointless once you've taken the more advanced stuff. If you want bitcoin to actually have a long life, you have to use it. If you're just in it for a quick buck (denominated in dirty, dirty fiat) then you can keep hoarding it, but eventually its value will be $0.
I assume you're in the latter group.
