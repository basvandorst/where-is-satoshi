OK. Understand. Which approach would you recommend? For a faster syncronization.
@_date: 2018-09-11 13:22:46
That's right: that was my problem. The sync was about 4 weeks :-)
@_date: 2018-09-11 18:06:13
Can you explain why saving time with the chainstate and blocks folder? Should I rather host them instead of the bootstrap.dat?

@_date: 2018-10-29 18:05:44
Awesome. Wehre can I buy that?
@_date: 2018-10-29 18:03:42

Today at work I had to work with CSS filters. I used as image the Bitcoin logo. When I came to the filter "hue-rotate", I suddenly saw the BCH logo. So all they did was turn the color space and change the tilt angle. Pooh. Very reprehensible. ;)

Absolutely nonsense.
