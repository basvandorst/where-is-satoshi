Steem the blockchain. It currently handles peak transaction volumes much higher than Ethereum just fine.
I don't agree with DPoS being mayority rule (which is true for pure PoS). It may be somewhat more hardfork resistant than PoW in the sense that consensus is reached among elected block producers but that doesn't make it more centralized. OTOH Bitcoin block producers are just a handful of mining pools.

Begging/asking for bitcoins is absolutely not allowed, no matter how badly you need the bitcoins.

This (hopefully temporary) situation is good as business seek to make an efficient use of blockchain space..
Blockchain bloat harms both users and nodes.
Remember SatoshiDice bloat? When fees gone up hey had to redesign their system to make better use of blockchain resources.
Same thing happens with many bitcoin systems today. Someone here mentioned coinbase makes a 2nd internal transaction for every deposit/withdrawal, that's just an example.

Delegated Proof Of Stake is the answer to your democratic needs. But I think all this greed of Bitcoin gives it better resilency.
