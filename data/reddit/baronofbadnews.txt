Both crashed in tandem so you won't get any more BTC for your BCH than you would have at any other time.
I think holding both is fine, I still have my BCH (although I left mine on Coinbase). It's a way of hedging your bets in my opinion.
Just so you know, if you're an American you'll owe taxes on the BCH as income. The internet is telling me that BCH was worth $450ish on August 1st so you should record $450 * 0.0705 as income from the fork.
Then if/when you sell the BCH your basis is $450 * 0.0705 so your taxable profit is whatever is over that.
@_date: 2018-01-19 17:41:41
It will not affect the BTC. Nothing that happens with the BCH impacts the BTC now. It's like a river that split into two rivers. You can piss in one without polluting the other. The BTC/BCH argument is over which of the two rivers should be considered the original river but it's a dumb argument because that's just not how rivers work.
In 2017 you got airdropped BCH that was worth $450/coin. The IRS wants income tax on that $450 * 0.0705 ($32) of income.
If you sell it today for, say, $1,800/coin then your short term capital gains is $1,350/coin so $1,350 * 0.0705 = $95. They'll want STCG tax on that next year.
Basically you're making an arbitrary assumption that whatever you originally paid for the BTC is the basis of the BTC side of the fork. Therefore the BCH side of the fork has no basis, you got it for nothing. The IRS want to know what it was worth when you got it ($32) so they can tax you on it because they call it earnings. That's already happened, that's 2017, that needs to go in your taxes as form 1040 line 21 other income, no matter what you do. Once you record it as $32 of income on your taxes your basis in the BCH is $32, that's what you "paid" for it.

They freaked out because of the ideological conflicts between the two options. In practice everyone holding bitcoin got their holdings replicated in both forks and so it would have been entirely possible for them to simply do nothing and come out ahead regardless of which succeeded. But there was a tendency for people to say "my bitcoin is the true bitcoin" and sell all of their forked holdings in one to increase their forked holdings in another.

Well, they've got it. But you can log in to your account and send it to an offline BCH wallet. Don't send it to a BTC address though.

Extract from Warren Buffett's 2014 letter to shareholders:
In 1986, I purchased a 400-acre farm, located 50 miles north of Omaha, from the FDIC. It cost me $280,000, considerably less than what a failed bank had lent against the farm a few years earlier. I knew nothing about operating a farm. But I have a son who loves farming, and I learned from him both how many bushels of corn and soybeans the farm would produce and what the operating expenses would be. From these estimates, I calculated the normalized return from the farm to then be about 10%. I also thought it was likely that productivity would improve over time and that crop prices would move higher as well. Both expectations proved out.
I needed no unusual knowledge or intelligence to conclude that the investment had no downside and potentially had substantial upside. There would, of course, be the occasional bad crop, and prices would sometimes disappoint. But so what? There would be some unusually good years as well, and I would never be under any pressure to sell the property. Now, 28 years later, the farm has tripled its earnings and is worth five times or more what I paid. I still know nothing about farming and recently made just my second visit to the farm.
In 1993, I made another small investment. Larry Silverstein, Salomon’s landlord when I was the company’s CEO, told me about a New York retail property adjacent to New York University that the Resolution Trust Corp. was selling. Again, a bubble had popped — this one involving commercial real estate — and the RTC had been created to dispose of the assets of failed savings institutions whose optimistic lending practices had fueled the folly.
Here, too, the analysis was simple. As had been the case with the farm, the unleveraged current yield from the property was about 10%. But the property had been undermanaged by the RTC, and its income would increase when several vacant stores were leased. Even more important, the largest tenant — who occupied around 20% of the project’s space — was paying rent of about $5 per foot, whereas other tenants averaged $70. The expiration of this bargain lease in nine years was certain to provide a major boost to earnings. The property’s location was also superb: NYU wasn’t going anywhere.
I joined a small group — including Larry and my friend Fred Rose — in purchasing the building. Fred was an experienced, high-grade real estate investor who, with his family, would manage the property. And manage it they did. As old leases expired, earnings tripled. Annual distributions now exceed 35% of our initial equity investment. Moreover, our original mortgage was refinanced in 1996 and again in 1999, moves that allowed several special distributions totaling more than 150% of what we had invested. I’ve yet to view the property.
Income from both the farm and the NYU real estate will probably increase in decades to come. Though the gains won’t be dramatic, the two investments will be solid and satisfactory holdings for my lifetime and, subsequently, for my children and grandchildren.
I tell these tales to illustrate certain fundamentals of investing:
* You don’t need to be an expert in order to achieve satisfactory investment returns. But if you aren’t, you must recognize your limitations and follow a course certain to work reasonably well. Keep things simple and don’t swing for the fences. When promised quick profits, respond with a quick “no.”
* Focus on the future productivity of the asset you are considering. If you don’t feel comfortable making a rough estimate of the asset’s future earnings, just forget it and move on. No one has the ability to evaluate every investment possibility. But omniscience isn’t necessary; you only need to understand the actions you undertake.
* If you instead focus on the prospective price change of a contemplated purchase, you are speculating. There is nothing improper about that. I know, however, that I am unable to speculate successfully, and I am skeptical of those who claim sustained success at doing so. Half of all coin-flippers will win their first toss; none of those winners has an expectation of profit if he continues to play the game. And the fact that a given asset has appreciated in the recent past is never a reason to buy it.
* With my two small investments, I thought only of what the properties would produce and cared not at all about their daily valuations. Games are won by players who focus on the playing field — not by those whose eyes are glued to the scoreboard. If you can enjoy Saturdays and Sundays without looking at stock prices, give it a try on weekdays.
* Forming macro opinions or listening to the macro or market predictions of others is a waste of time. Indeed, it is dangerous because it may blur your vision of the facts that are truly important. (When I hear TV commentators glibly opine on what the market will do next, I am reminded of Mickey Mantle’s scathing comment: “You don’t know how easy this game is until you get into that broadcasting booth.”)
My two purchases were made in 1986 and 1993. What the economy, interest rates, or the stock market might do in the years immediately following — 1987 and 1994 — was of no importance to me in determining the success of those investments. I can’t remember what the headlines or pundits were saying at the time. Whatever the chatter, corn would keep growing in Nebraska and students would flock to NYU.
There is one major difference between my two small investments and an investment in stocks. Stocks provide you minute-to-minute valuations for your holdings, whereas I have yet to see a quotation for either my farm or the New York real estate.
It should be an enormous advantage for investors in stocks to have those wildly fluctuating valuations placed on their holdings — and for some investors, it is. After all, if a moody fellow with a farm bordering my property yelled out a price every day to me at which he would either buy my farm or sell me his — and those prices varied widely over short periods of time depending on his mental state — how in the world could I be other than benefited by his erratic behavior? If his daily shout-out was ridiculously low, and I had some spare cash, I would buy his farm. If the number he yelled was absurdly high, I could either sell to him or just go on farming.
Owners of stocks, however, too often let the capricious and irrational behavior of their fellow owners cause them to behave irrationally as well. Because there is so much chatter about markets, the economy, interest rates, price behavior of stocks, etc., some investors believe it is important to listen to pundits — and, worse yet, important to consider acting upon their comments.
Those people who can sit quietly for decades when they own a farm or apartment house too often become frenetic when they are exposed to a stream of stock quotations and accompanying commentators delivering an implied message of “Don’t just sit there — do something.” For these investors, liquidity is transformed from the unqualified benefit it should be to a curse.
A “flash crash” or some other extreme market fluctuation can’t hurt an investor any more than an erratic and mouthy neighbor can hurt my farm investment. Indeed, tumbling markets can be helpful to the true investor if he has cash available when prices get far out of line with values. A climate of fear is your friend when investing; a euphoric world is your enemy.
During the extraordinary financial panic that occurred late in 2008, I never gave a thought to selling my farm or New York real estate, even though a severe recession was clearly brewing. And if I had owned 100% of a solid business with good long-term prospects, it would have been foolish for me to even consider dumping it. So why would I have sold my stocks that were small participations in wonderful businesses? True, any one of them might eventually disappoint, but as a group they were certain to do well. Could anyone really believe the earth was going to swallow up the incredible productive assets and unlimited human ingenuity existing in America?
When Charlie Munger and I buy stocks — which we think of as small portions of businesses — our analysis is very similar to that which we use in buying entire businesses. We first have to decide whether we can sensibly estimate an earnings range for five years out or more. If the answer is yes, we will buy the stock (or business) if it sells at a reasonable price in relation to the bottom boundary of our estimate. If, however, we lack the ability to estimate future earnings — which is usually the case — we simply move on to other prospects. In the 54 years we have worked together, we have never forgone an attractive purchase because of the macro or political environment, or the views of other people. In fact, these subjects never come up when we make decisions.
It’s vital, however, that we recognize the perimeter of our “circle of competence” and stay well inside of it. Even then, we will make some mistakes, both with stocks and businesses. But they will not be the disasters that occur, for example, when a long-rising market induces purchases that are based on anticipated price behavior and a desire to be where the action is.

My understanding was that a fraction of coins survived the hack of Mt.Gox and that these were to used to pay the creditors (those who had their coins stolen).

You have them either way. The entity to retrieve them from is you. If you held them in a private wallet before then you now have a BCH balance and a BTC balance in that private wallet. If you held them in an exchange then at some point the exchange should give you the BCH.
Forks don't create anything, they just fork. The BCH is the BTC you held prefork. It has the exact same transaction history, it was mined at the same time, it's in the same place. The BTC is also the BTC you held prefork.
It's better not to think about it in terms of one being the continuation of what you had and the other being an addition.

If it was on Coinbase at the time of the fork (August 1st I think) then they should have given you the BCH sometime in December. That's when they gave me mine. If it was in an offline wallet on August 1st then the offline wallet now contains both BCH and BTC. You don't need to do anything in that situation.
Whoever had the private key for the BTC on August 1st suddenly found that they had BCH and BTC associated with that private key. If that was you, great. If that was Coinbase, and you subsequently told Coinbase to give you the BTC they'd have given you the forked BTC only, they still have the BCH. That make sense?

I'm with him. Buffett is a value investor, and always has been. He looks at companies and breaks them down into assets, revenue streams, liabilities etc, his skill has always been in finding out what the value of a company is.
That's a very different philosophy than most, for whom the value is whatever someone else will pay for it. It might be rational to buy something that you think is completely worthless if you expect to be able to sell it on to someone else for more, there's a lot of money to be made in speculation and flipping etc.
But Buffett don't play that game. Buffett don't flip. If he buys something it's because he's priced the opportunity cost of the acquisition capital and he's calculated the value of the assets and the revenue stream and the latter is greater than the former. He buys to own the asset, and the output of that asset.
So, with all that said, yeah Buffett doesn't want cryptocurrencies any more than a vegan wants a steak dinner. He's not saying that nobody will make money on cryptocurrencies any more than he would say that nobody would make money from the dot com bubble. But it's just about the furthest thing from his taste you can get.
You've got to remember that we're not making value here, we're just moving it. We gave our dollars to the early adopters and then got our dollars back with extra from the latecomers. Bubbles don't make value, they make money.

Coinbase works for the masses. The interface is extremely clean and user friendly with the different wallets displayed for different currencies, nice little "buy" and "sell" buttons, easy to read graphs and no storage concerns or offline wallets required.
I don't use Coinbase anymore because I learned how to wire funds to Bitstamp but I can absolutely see why people do. Gemini caps ACH transfers at $500 and won't unlock the funds for a week and also won't work with a shitton of banks or in a shitton of states, Bitstamp makes you wire money to Slovenia, GDAX looks super intimidating to a novice, CEX is region locked and the website is pretty hard to use, BitFinex is region locked, and so forth.
Coinbase is winning market share because Coinbase is giving the users what they want. Not the users like you or I who want batching and Segwit, but the users like my father in law who wants to be able to enter in his credit card number and "invest" in bitcoin.
The new money pouring into bitcoin wants to be able to buy bitcoin in no more than five mouseclicks on big obvious buttons after entering their credit card/bank details. And they want the bitcoin stored for them free of charge the way a bank would. And then they want to sell it in no more than five mouseclicks on big obvious buttons, with the money withdrawn back to their bank.
Whether or not that's what the users "should" want is irrelevant. The users want what they want, and what they want is Coinbase.

The best poker players aren't playing with their own money buddy. They sell shares of their action to other poker professionals in staking agreements to limit variance.
It may be plus EV to enter the WSOP as a highly skilled tournament player, you may be statistically likely to win back more than your entry fee, but the odds of you winning any serious money are low. Plus EV, but high variance. It's much more rational to pay 1% of the entry fee of 100 different highly skilled tournament players.

Alternatively if you want to do "my fork is the one true fork, BCH is heresy" you could trade your BCH for even more BTC and then withdraw that to your BTC wallet. And yeah, transfer to GDAX and withdraw is the way to do it due to GDAX covering the fees. If you want to get really keen (and you traded the BCH for BTC), withdraw to a Segwit enabled wallet.

This is incorrect. The speculated price and the long term utility of cryptocurrencies have as much to do with each other as geocities being purchased for $4b and the success of the internet.
I'd actually argue the inverse, if you're here for the bubble and to make a quick buck then definitely hold. If you're here because you think cryptocurrencies are the future but you're not trying to speculate then you can get in whenever you want.
Cryptocurrencies do not currently work better than existing currencies. If you believe in them then you should transition when it becomes practical to do so, just as we all transitioned to buying on Amazon as they got their logistics network and product availability down.
If you're buying crypto today then you're doing the equivalent of ordering shit online in 1997 when it costs more than the local store and you had to print out an order form and mail it to them. It's speculation only. The tech doesn't need us to support it, it'll show up inevitably anyway.

I think rebalancing is totally healthy. Let's say you decide that 20% crypto is a good amount of high risk exposure to have. Your net worth is $30k so you buy $6k crypto, $24k stocks. The stocks grow 10% and the crypto grows 1000%. You now have $66k crypto and $26.4k stocks for a new net worth of $92.4k.
At that point it's perfectly rational to say "I still only want to be able to lose 20% of my net worth from a crypto crash at any given time" and convert $47.52k into stocks.

Nah. His point is legit. Gemini wire deposits go through in about 2 hours but Coinbase non-wire deposits take about a week to get the cash in. And on GDAX you can't buy if you don't have the cash deposited.
Coinbase charge scam level fees but part of what they do for those fees is buy a bitcoin for you and hold it while your bank payment clears. I was in the same position he was in and had to pay Coinbase $200 to do what'd cost $20 on GDAX, but I didn't have the ability to wire $ to Gemini from where I was.

As for a collapse of fiat currencies, it won't happen overnight and it won't happen without a transitional period.
There's no reason to think that the collapse of fiat would lead to mortgage defaults either. Right now if your paycheck covers your mortgage then that means the value of your labour exceeds the value of the house after it is broken up into 360 monthly chunks with interest added. Changing currency wouldn't change that. If I was paid in silver bullion and the bank wanted my mortgage in silver I could still pay it.
There really is no link between "crypto is the future" and "I should buy and hoard crypto right now" beyond "I think it's currently undervalued and I can flip it".

Bitcoin doesn't have any innate asset value, nor any future revenue streams. It's a currency, not an investment. You use it to buy and sell things, not to produce things.
If a company has $20 in assets and $10 in liabilities then I can establish a floor value of that company as $10 in equity alone. But let's say it also produces $1 in revenue each year. I can calculate the value of that annuity in today's dollars.
Add the two together and that gets my estimate at what the company is worth.

The IRS is both in control and totally reasonable. And also completely underfunded which means that the tax burden shifts onto those least able to attempt cheating bullshit that would be discovered through better computers and audits.
The IRS is your friend and if you actually fund it then they'll be able to get more money from high net worth tax cheats and not need so much from you.
This defund the IRS shit annoys me to no end. The less funding they have the more they rely upon W2 income, which is easy to check and easy to tax, to collect. The guy driving around a 20 year old piece of shit truck with defund the IRS bumper stickers is not the guy with the high priced accountants who is next in line to escape audit if the IRS lose funding.

At this point the price and the tech are completely not correlated. It's like the internet in 2000. Some people correctly understood that the internet was going to fundamentally change the world while many other people thought it was a fad. The "change the world" folks were right, but the dotcom bubble was still a bubble which completely failed to accurately assign values to internet stocks.
Whether the underlying tech is good has absolutely no bearing on whether the speculated price of assets tangentially related to the tech is accurate.

Let's say someone offers to a contract to buy a bitcoin in a month's time at a set price of $12k. It's currently $11.7k so if you have a bitcoin lying around then you'll think to yourself "my time value of $11.7k is for a month is less than $300, I'll buy one and fill that contract".
Let's say the bitcoin price rises above $12k. That contract can be sold by the issuer to third parties.
Now let's say they bundle together large amounts of bitcoin contracts. But obviously there's a potential for loss if they're forced to buy bitcoins at $12k and the market crashes. So they take out insurance against the loss from another player.
The other player wants to recoup their losses in the event that the market crashes and so they sell their own contracts requiring a buyer to buy from them at price below current market value six months out, should the first contract be completed.
All of these different instruments are based on the underlying asset but they all float freely. The contracts don't ever need to actually even be completed, the right to collect a profit is profit, the instruments replace the underlying asset.
If bitcoin is selling for $15k and you have a piece of paper giving you the right to buy one for $10k then you don't need to buy a bitcoin and then sell it to get your $5k cash, the piece of paper is worth $5k. You sell your paper on the paper market and you issue yet more paper.

Anyone, regardless of intelligence, who "knows" what bitcoin is going to do is lying to you. The tech is cool but what we're seeing at the moment is a speculative bubble based on that tech. The internet is some extremely clever and valuable tech but that didn't make the dot com bubble any less of a bubble.
Investors in 2001 couldn't separate "the internet going to change the world forever" with "geocities is worth $3,570,000,000".
The legitimacy of the underlying tech doesn't speak to any specific market valuation.
The reality is that if decentralized ledger tech does take over for making payments there is absolutely no reason why the general population can't slowly transition to it as it becomes more mainstream. Perhaps first using it for remittances and e-commerce, then settling between individuals, until finally it makes it onto the high street. The value of your assets will remain the same regardless of whether you're the first one in or the last. A house offers the same value to the buyer regardless of whether they pay in bitcoin or dollars, they'll give up currency equal to the utility it offers them.
Believing that the tech will eventually change the world doesn't in any way suggest that it is rational to start massing the currency before it becomes useful. If we're buying bitcoin for anything other than to use in the short term as a form of currency then we are speculating.
@_date: 2017-12-27 17:40:12
It's perfectly simple.
The decision to buy something is completely separate from the decision to reallocate between currencies.
If you buy something with bitcoin and do not replace the bitcoin to retain your previous currency allocation then you have not made a purchase, you have made a reallocation.
Let's use Euros and Dollars to make it simpler.
Imagine you have 500 dollars and 420 euros. You want to buy 10 pizzas. The pizza shop will accept payment as 100 dollars or 84 euros.
Let's say you pay him in dollars. You now have 400 dollars and 420 euros. What you have done here is a reallocation, your dollar to euro ratio has changed. Let's say the euro falls to 1.10 per dollar. That 100 dollars you paid for pizza is now worth 91 euros, and yet you could have settled the bill for 84 euros. If we follow your argument then it would be irrational to ever pay for the pizza in dollars because you could experience an exchange rate shift. The problem being that you could also experience an exchange rate shift in the opposite direction, and therefore it would also be irrational to buy the pizza in euros.
The problem is, of course, not with the currency used to purchase the pizza but rather with the fact that by using just one of the two currencies and then not replacing it you have done a reallocation of your net worth between the two currencies. And any time you do a reallocation in any direction you expose yourself to the potential for a loss from the exchange rate fluctuating.
It doesn't matter whether you use dollars or euros, what matters is if you pay in 100 dollars you should immediately swap 42 of your euros for 50 dollars to keep the ratio the same.

Unfortunately not in a hugely meaningful amount. To try and calculate the value you need to look at the supply compared to the demand. While gold does have uses the demand the supply is more than sufficient for them. Gold isn't an especially rare element, not when you consider how little we use.
It's expensive because of our desire to turn it into bars and bury it in vaults has contracted the supply, not because of the innate utility.
Diamonds are the same. They're rare, but they're not so rare that we couldn't easily supply enough for all the uses we have for them. But most diamonds mined are never sold, they're placed in vaults for all eternity to keep them off the market.

Why would you want to spend dollars on anything when the amount of bitcoin you could buy with those dollars is declining so rapidly? I once bought a pizza with dollars and the amount of BTC I could have bought with it back then is worth like $300 now.
Spending is different from reallocating. Let's say I have half my money in BTC and half my USD. If I spend BTC on expenses and don't move USD to keep my 50/50 split then what I've effectively done is sold BTC for USD. Same if I spend USD. But if I do keep that 50/50 ratio then it's the same either way.
The fees are the real issue.

The IRS is pretty reasonable if you make a good faith effort to comply, use an acceptable accounting method, and can show your records and calculations upon audit. Worst case scenario they'll run their own numbers and ask you for the difference. But it's the people not keeping any records and assuming all gains are tax free who are going to get fucked when they can't show their basis and the IRS taxes them on the total value.
If you used weighted average rather than LIFO you're not going to have issues.

So if you imagine a marketplace you'll have a differing number of buyers and sellers with differing amounts they want to pay. When there are more buyers than sellers the price moves up, when there are more sellers the price moves down, right?
Now consider that the GDAX marketplace (the one powering Coinbase) offers not just BTC/USD and ETH/USD but also ETH/BTC. The first two are unrelated, what BTC price does doesn't necessarily impact ETH price. But once you add that third one then suddenly you can convert from USD into BTC into ETH into USD.
That means that the third marketplace gives people the ability to trade between the first two if the prices are different. Let's say BTC was $100, ETH was $10, but ETH/BTC was 0.2. You could buy 10 ETH for $100, convert them into 2 BTC, and then sell those BTC for $200. But by making those middle man trades you add liquidity to the market, reducing that difference and making the market more efficient. If you and another guy are bidding for those middle man trades then eventually the exchange rate between the two will reach $100 = $100.
Now let's make it more complex. We'll throw in LTC and BCH. And Euros and GBP. Each crypto can now be traded for three different other cryptocurrencies and three different fiat currencies, all of which can in turn be traded. Now we have a complete mess of exchange rates, all of which represent opportunities to flip something at a profit.
People trade these and again they reach a fairly efficient equilibrium because of people doing arbitrage (buying on one at one price and selling on the other at another price until the two prices stabilize).
Now remember that we were only talking about one exchange. There are dozens of exchanges. Now shit gets really messy. The number of potential markets that need to stay accurately pegged against each other increases exponentially.

Rather than tracking the individual satoshi and their prices you assume they are commingled and that the average price for the group is the basis for all of them.
Let's say you buy one bitcoin for $5 and one for $9. If you trade a bitcoin for $8 of ethereum then that's a taxable event. You've sold a bitcoin. If you sold the $5 one you have a $3 profit. If you sold the $9 one you have a $1 loss. This very quickly gets very complicated.
Weighted average works by saying you don't have a $5 bitcoin and a $9 one, you have two $7 bitcoins and therefore you have a $1 gain on the sale.

It provides stability and predictability against the risk of fluctuations. Similar to insurance.
Imagine a world in which insurance was perfectly priced and perfectly efficient. Say a $1 contract to insure against a $100 risk with a 1% chance of happening.
Even though the two sides of the contract are mathematically identical the contract itself has value. It allows the insured party to free up liquidity, to improve long term planning, and to leverage greater risks. There's an argument to be made that commerce could not have effectively taken off on any level without risk mitigation.
Let's say I want to have a bitcoin in six months. The current price is $10k. If I buy one today for $10k then I am accepting that the price may drop down to $1k, resulting in a $9k effective loss. So I may prefer to not buy one until the day I need one. If there is one for sale today but I don't want to buy it for another six months then what I need is a middle man who is willing to hold it for those six months, paying the market price for it today, and selling it to me for the market price in six months. A third party who is willing to accept the risk that I am not.
@_date: 2017-12-26 19:04:02
This is what I'd do too. Technically every trade is a taxable event and the value of what you bought and sold at the time of the trade is needed to calculate the thousands of short term capital gains. That would be the correct way of doing it.
What I would do is treat the crypto as a black box. You put $10k into the black box. That's your basis. The first $10k you take back is reduction of basis. Every dollar after that is long term capital gains at your LTCG rate. It's not right, but they can only really see your entry and exit to banks, not what happens in between. It's good enough imo.

I think you're confused by what a run on the bank is. Banks use what is called fractional reserve lending. Basically they only have a small amount of customer deposits as cash at any given time, enough to cover their expected withdrawals in excess of expected new deposits. The rest is loaned out to other customers. This means that if everyone tries to withdraw their money from the bank at once then they'll find that the bank doesn't actually have their money. FDIC insurance offers to cover deposits up to $250k in that case.
If you have your bitcoin in your own wallet there is no bank, just as there isn't if you have gold bars under your bed. You don't need FDIC insurance for your gold bars under your bed because everyone won't come to your bed trying to withdraw their share of your gold bars under your bed because that's not a thing.
The fact that FDIC insurance is even a thing is evidence of a problem with the banking system, that it's run on trust that deposits will be available when you need them, even though you know rationally that that simply cannot be true for everyone.
None of that applies to bitcoin. It's good that bitcoin doesn't have FDIC insurance.

FDIC insures against a run on the bank causing the bank to be unable to honor customer deposits. With bitcoin there are no customer deposits.

You own part of the entity that generates revenues. If they give a dividend then they give all the owners a proportionate share of the cash. If they don't give a dividend the owners still all own a proportionate share of the cash.
If a company chooses to reinvest the cash into internal growth, as Netflix has always chosen to do for example, you can still simply award yourself a dividend each year by selling 5% (an example) of your overall holdings. As long as the company grows by at least 5% annually your dollar denominated holdings will remain constant while giving you a cash income.
Obviously it can get a little more complicated than that example in the real world but these days the market generally doesn't distinguish between cash dividends and reinvested growth, as long as the strategy is appropriate for the sector.
If a tech company started paying large cash dividends you would wonder why they're so low on good ways to use cash and good ideas to fund that they're just giving it back to the investors. In that sector cash dividends signal an end to innovation and internal reinvestment. Whereas if a utility started reinvesting all their earnings internally you'd be suspicious because it's not like they're about to invent a new type of electricity.

If your existing accountant is a CPA who cannot distinguish between an operating gain and a capital gain then yes, you should fire them.
It's not a question of whether you are making money, it's a question of where the money is coming from.
Imagine I buy a mining rig for $1,000 with a lifespan of 1 year. I spend 6 months mining and make $500 of bitcoin. I then sell the mining rig for $1,500 because it has appreciated in value due to changing market conditions. I now have $2,000, I started with $1,000, but that does not mean I have made $1,000 from mining bitcoin.
The bitcoin mining profits in the above situation are actually $0, the $500 of bitcoin is offset by the $500 of depreciation \(cost \* percent of useful life consumed\) on the mining rig. I have made $0 from mining bitcoin, and $1,000 from holding an asset that happened to appreciate significantly due to external market conditions which were independent of my mining activities. $0 from mining bitcoin, $1,000 from trading miners.
You can't simply combine the two. It doesn't work that way. Seriously, ask your CPA. They'll explain this to you.

No, it's literally how it works for companies that don't pay dividends. Berkshire Hathaway for example. Instead of giving you a portion of their profits as cash they reinvest the profits, year after year. But because they're making money the value of your stock increases. Your dividend is included within the value of your stock, you can sell some whenever you want to take it.
You own 10% of company A which has a total market cap of $2,000,000. Company A makes $100,000 profit and distributes it as a dividend. You receive $10,000. Company A is still worth $2,000,000 but now you have $10k cash. You can buy more company A stock if you like, increasing your holdings to $210,000, or keep cash. Up to you.
You also own 10% of company B which also has a total market cap of $2,000,000. It also makes $100,000 in profit, but company B reinvests the money itself. It is now worth $2,100,000 and your shares are worth $210,000. You can sell 4.7% of your shares for $10,000 if you want.
There's really no difference between the two. You don't care whether or not they distribute a dividend, you care whether they make money. You can choose to reinvest a cash dividend into increasing your investment if you want. You can choose to cash out an increase in the value of your investment if you want. They're the same thing.

Bitcoin is an open protocol.
There is no individual in the middle masterminding it. Nobody is secretly paying Peter with Paul's money. Nobody controls bitcoin.
There is no promise of returns through a secret mechanism. Quite the contrary, bitcoin is openly inert, all buyers know that if they buy one it won't produce more bitcoin, it'll always only ever be worth one bitcoin.
There is no fraudulent accounting taking place. When I make money from bitcoin I know that I have done so by selling it to someone else at a higher price. Likewise they know that they have bought bitcoin from me.
Because of the above facts it is immune from a Ponzi collapse. Ponzis are intrinsically unsustainable because they are built on fraudulent accounting that is covered up by constant growth. They promise a return paid from a secret mechanism that generates value, but actually provide the return by stealing from newer members. Because Ponzis cannot grow indefinitely they will always collapse, leaving the last round of participants penniless.
Bitcoin is a classic bubble. It couldn't be further from a Ponzi scheme because it is by its very nature open. The schedule of new bitcoins to be issued, the mechanism by which they're mined, how they are transacted, where they came from, and so forth, are all in the code.
Calling it a bubble isn't defending it, a bubble is still a bad thing. But a bubble is not a Ponzi, as I hope I have now shown you. These are different things.

Prior events have no relevance to that. You can’t net it all together. If you lost $1k in the January crash and then, in an unrelated decision, make a trade today that results in a $500 gain you didn’t still lose $500 on that second trade, even though you lost $500 overall.

If you take the popular idea of Nazis then you're thinking 1936 onward, to which the answer is no, those Nazis weren't socialists. No more than the Republic of China is in China. If you look at the economic governance of Nazi Germany then again, no socialism, no socialist policies.
But sure, if you wanna go back to the mid 1920s then you'll find yourself some people who believed in state ownership of the means of production.
The askhistorians wiki has a section devoted to this question if you're genuinely curious.
But basically the answer is no, Nazis were not in any way socialists. That's a myth perpetuated by lazy people more interested in memes than history. Don't be that guy.

Whether you buy, sell, or hold today has no impact on losses you have already realized so far this year. If you could buy in today at $6.7k and sell at $7k that's $0.3k profit on that trade, whether you're down $10k for the year or up $10k on the year

If the double bottom was bullish then the triple bottom wouldn't exist.
Let's say you see a double bottom, put your money in, and it drops. You're now at a double top so naturally you take your money out, that's a bearish pattern. The price recovers a little bit, and you're back at a triple bottom, time to put the money back in. Buy low, sell high, thanks TA.
Literally all of those chart patterns amount to "sometimes if it's going up it'll keep going up and sometimes if it's going down it'll keep going down" and in every case the preceding pattern makes a mockery of the predictive value of it.

In every trade there is a winner, a loser, and the broker's fee. If you're not the broker then that means that on average you lose money on every trade. Naturally if you can be on the winning side each time then that'd be best, but failing that it's probably best just to hold.

It's a spectrum. A completely privately owned society would have insurance based law enforcement etc where you pay your protection money to the equivalent of a local mafia and they guarantee that anyone who steals from you will end up regretting it. National defence contracts would be auctioned off to private armies. There would be a judge's guild famed for their knowledge and impartiality and people would pay top dollar for the best judges to decide their cases.
Obviously no country operates that way. The socialism vs capitalism debate occupies a relatively small area in the middle of the spectrum. Both sides agree on, maybe, 95% of economic activity.
It's important to recognize that this isn't an ideological chasm, it's nitpicking between two groups who pretty much agree on all the big issues.

He’s a shitty lawyer. I work for a good public accounting firm.
It’s very simple. Let’s say the auditing firm fuck up and miss a fraud. People who used the auditors report will attempt to recover from the auditor on the basis that they trusted the auditor’s opinion. We put a lot of language in the opinion explaining that we could be wrong and that all we’re saying is that we did our audit in a professional way and didn’t lie. What they would need to find is a client document showing the fraud **AND** evidence that we looked at it. If they get one of those they can argue that either we looked at it and therefore knew and lied, or we didn’t look at it, in which case we were negligent.
Auditor’s aren’t liable for fuckups as long as they are reasonable fuckups, not negligence. We delete all client files so that nobody can ever say “you had the document, you should have known”.

Basically you borrow a bitcoin from the exchange and sell it at the current price (they hold onto the money). Then, later on, you tell them to use some of the proceeds from the sale to buy back the bitcoin you owe them. If there's any money left over from your sale of the borrowed bitcoin then you get to keep that, that's your money.
Because you don't actually need to own the bitcoin to sell it you can leverage the fuck out of it. If you only have 1 bitcoin then the most you can do is sell it, wait for the price to go down, then buy it back lower. But if the exchange will let you do 5x leverage then you can borrow 5 bitcoins from the exchange, sell all 5, buy 5 back lower, and repay them with the new 5 at the lower price, pocketing the difference.
The problem is, what happens if the price goes up. You still need to repay the exchange their bitcoin but the money they're holding for you from the first sale isn't enough to cover it. They don't trust you not to default on repaying the bitcoins you borrowed if the price goes up so they normally require a deposit (hence needing 1 bitcoin of your own to sell 5 of theirs at 5x leverage). When the price goes up your deposit is no longer covering the difference, and so they ask you to start adding additional cash to make sure that they can rebuy the borrowed bitcoins with the cash they're holding for you.
If the price keeps going up you need to keep topping up the money they're holding for you to keep it at a certain ratio. If it goes up above that ratio then they'll liquidate the short, rebuy the coins they sold on your behalf with the money they have, and pocket anything left over.
In relatively stable markets with small swings leverage can be used with a degree of safety. You can give them some buffer and have time to top it up as needed. But in markets with 20% swings that's not going to work as well. You'll need large amounts of additional cash on hand to make sure you don't have the position closed on you (with a total loss), at which point the whole leverage idea is pretty pointless.
I read that Bitfinex was deliberately manipulating prices to close out big shorts. It doesn't matter if the price subsequently drops if the short has already been closed due to not making a margin call (topping it up). If Bitfinex spike the price of their exchange out of the acceptable margin for the short then they can legitimately end the short contract, seize whatever was deposited, and refuse to honour any proceeds that the contract would have made once the market spike stops. Similarly if the server goes down and they can't make the payments Bitfinex still closed out their shorts. Super shady stuff.

No they don't, lack of FDIC coverage isn't a problem with bitcoin. Banks use fractional reserve lending, they don't actually have your money, they have a tiny fraction of yours and everyone else's money and lend the rest out. This means your money isn't there. They keep enough money on hand to cover your expected day to day needs but you, and every other customer of the bank, all know that they can't possibly return all of your deposits.
And yet the only way the system can work is if you know that your money isn't there but choose to pretend that it is anyway. If we panic and try to recover our money then it's not there, if we trust that they have it then it is.
To resolve this issue the US gov offered to guarantee up to $250k of deposits in the event of a run on the bank causing the bank to be unable to honour deposits. The FDIC guarantee isn't an advantage of traditional banking, it's an attempt to paper over the glaring disadvantage of traditional banking, that it only works if you believe in something that you know to be untrue.
Saying that bitcoin is bad because it doesn't have FDIC coverage is like saying that bitcoin is bad because it doesn't have airbags. It doesn't need airbags because bitcoin is unlikely to have a high speed highway collision and it doesn't need FDIC coverage because the bitcoin isn't only in your wallet if you believe in it.

Bitcoins 100% bubbled. A bubble says nothing about what the subject intrinsically is, only how an irrational market subjectively values it. Beanie babies are soft toys, the beanie baby market was a bubble. Internet commerce companies are companies using a digital marketplace rather than a physical one. The dot com boom was a bubble. See the difference? Arguing about bubbles makes bitcoin supporters look dumb because bitcoin objectively bubbled last year. Rather than fight a pointless war simply dismiss the bubble as irrational market speculation that isn’t relevant to what the technology is.

They don't want you buying something liquid, immediately selling it for $, and then having the $. They want you to use the credit card for buying things, not for buying $.

That's a complicated question that deserves a better answer than I can give it but I'll try anyway.
1. You'd want a strong series of checks on the power of the central government, free independent press, independent judiciary, guaranteed constitutional freedoms, and police/army that would turn on their own government before they turned on the people. Without that there is nothing to prevent the national resources of the country being turned over to the brother of the leader. 
2. You'd want a high level of competence and experience in the civil administration, rather than it just being whoever supported the new socialist government at the right time.
3. Low levels of corruption within society as a whole.
4. A high level of economic education and experience within the central economic planning group. No 1+1=3 bullshit, a government that knows that if it wants to spend it actually has to tax.
5. Free and fair elections to hold the socialist government to account and to kick them out if necessary.
Probably some other things but those were the first ones to come to mind.
Regarding Blair, I'm not personally a fan, although it was his foreign policy that really annoyed me. He propelled Britain into two wars, neither of which the MoD were in any real position to fight, both of which we lost, both of which were ruinously expensive, almost entirely out of ego. A million people marched in the streets of London against the Iraq War and the Chilcot Report subsequently concluded that they were basically right. None of that is really relevant to his socialism though.
I didn't like university top-up fees which I believe lowered social mobility. I think the introduction of market forces and foundation hospitals into the NHS was pretty misguided. His refusal to raise taxes to pay for his plans led to increasing deficits through years of economic growth. Probably the only good things I'd say about him is that he was better than the Tories.
Still, he's not a bad socialist in the Maduro sense, he's wasn't locking people up for disagreeing with him or outlawing trading goods among the population. He's just a pretty shitty human being.

If you're a US taxpayer then bitcoin would be one of the most profitable ways to abuse the step up in basis while terminally ill.
In layman's terms, your basis is what you bought a thing at. So if you paid $1,000 for a bitcoin then your basis is $1,000. You pay tax on your capital gains, which is what you sold it for minus your basis. If you sell that bitcoin for $10,000 then $10,000 - your basis ($1,000) is your capital gains, $9,000.
When a long term investment passes from the deceased to the estate it receives a "step up in basis". The person inheriting has their basis set to the price at the time of death, rather than the basis carrying over. That way you can sell assets inherited for the market price without owing any tax.
If we assume that our friend here has an unrecognized capital gain of $1.6m then at 15% tax he has an unrecognized tax liability of $240,000. If he dies and passes the bitcoin on, that's wiped out, the inheritor gets the full amount tax free.

They're at the end of the line because E = A - L. L = creditors. The equity owned by shareholders in A is always equal to (A-L). That's simply how it works. Expressing it as a line isn't really valid.
Let's say you have $20. You borrow $20 off of one guy and $10 off of another. Your wallet now contains $50. However what you own is assets ($50) minus liabilities ($30), your equity is still $20.
If you want to dispose of the wallet then it wouldn't really be correct to say you're at the end of the line of people taking the money out of the wallet, rather that there's still only $20 of yours in the wallet.
Now let's say you were to buy $5 of candy with money from the wallet. What being at the end of the line means is that the two guys you borrowed money from each get their full amount back, and that the candy comes out of the $20 you put in.

You don't want to call it a hobby, you want to call it a business for the deductions of expenses. But the IRS wants to call it a hobby so that can tax you on revenue, not profits.
There is a pretty good case for them here too. It would depend upon whether he's doing this with an expectation of realizing a profit or whether he's an enthusiast. There was a recent case where a farm got declared a hobby farm because the IRS essentially said that he was clearly not running his farm with any intention of making money from it and was therefore a hobbyist, not a farmer.

If you knew how it worked we wouldn't be having this conversation.
They're deriving their value from the fact the bag has net assets in excess of liabilities.
Let's return to the wallet example. The wallet has $50 in it but the holder of the wallet owes $30 to other people.
If I were to sell you the wallet for $10 then I would not be deriving my $10 cashout from shifting the buck to a greater fool. I would be deriving it from the $20 equity within the wallet. You would not have been a fool to have bought the wallet. You're only right if you take it as axiomatically true that eventually the wallet will owe more money than it contains and there is absolutely no reason to believe that.
Also you're ignoring voluntary liquidations of small businesses, partnerships and so forth, and takeovers which are often done with cash. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:01:52
That's dumb as hell. The reason companies don't need to pay out dividends is because the ownership of the share represents incorporates the dividends.
Let's say you own 1% of Company A. Company A has assets worth $100,000 and your share is valued at $1,000 (this is a super simple example). If Company A has revenues of $1,000 then they could give each of their 100 shareholders $10 and continue to be worth $100,000. That's a dividend. But if they don't declare the dividend then they now have assets of $101,000, and you still own 1% of the company. Your share is now worth $1,010. You can simply sell 1% of your share and give yourself an effective dividend, getting your $10 and keeping your holdings steady at $1,000.
When you buy stocks you're buying a share of ownership in an enterprise, ideally a successful one. When it succeeds it doesn't matter whether they give you cash or whether they roll that cash back into the company, you own a share of that cash anyway.
It's nothing to do with Greater Fool Theory. Netflix has never paid dividends but if you were to offer to pay a Netflix shareholder twice what he paid for his shares five years ago you would not be a greater fool. The value of the underlying asset has changed therefore the value of ownership of that asset through shares has changed.
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:04:05
No it's not. It's tied to the market value of the assets + the market value of the projected revenue stream.

Don't do your own research and come to your own conclusions. The history of investing is full of failures that resulted from individual research. These people all believed themselves to be informed and sophisticated investors who knew a lot about the company they were investing in, for example.
The problem is the vast majority of us do not know enough about any complex field to judge the validity of the information we find when doing our own independent research.
The average person is not going to ever reach the level of doing primary experimental research in a highly technical field. The most they can hope for is to understand the papers written by the people that are. And when it comes to investing, that's dangerous. It's far, far more dangerous to think you know what you're doing than to know you don't know what you're doing.
Research if you like, but recognize that you're not equipped to judge the merits of any particular source you read and that any conclusions you reach could simply be due to limited exposure.
And then stay diversified. Don't invest more than you can afford to lose.

A lot of people apparently are enthusiasts for mining. People like to mine coins at a cost greater than market value in the hope that they can sell them at a profit when the price goes up, despite that being completely irrational. Additionally the correct tax treatment would be to recognize the value of the coins as revenue at market value when received, not when sold.

I deliberately simplified the hell out of it to make it easier for people to understand.
Obviously there is far more to stock valuation than the assets over liabilities, the purpose was to reflect that a cash dividend reflects an asset which the shareholders already own either way.
You're nitpicking, and doing so badly.
As for liquidation, normally it occurs involuntarily with failing companies which is why the shareholders being at the end of the line matters. E = A - L, if L &gt; A then yeah, the shareholders don't get shit. But if a successful company were to decide to liquidate overnight then they're absolutely going to get the net assets over liabilities. The only thing they wouldn't get is the value of the future revenue streams.
A company can be viewed as a combined asset (net assets in excess of liabilities) and future revenue stream. Whether the revenue stream is set to automatically reinvest or not is irrelevant.
Consider the question of what would happen if the hypothetical company above purchased one of its shares back with the $1,000, rather than issuing a dividend.

You were wrong then and you're wrong now. The way to fund a college education is not speculation, and let's be clear, until BTC replaces fiat currency it is speculation. If it does, great, I'm holding some, I win. But it's a speculative investment, high risk, high reward.
For every person who puts their kid's college fund in bitcoin and wins there are another ten who put their kid's college funds in other speculative investments and lose it. The argument "I won, therefore I was right to gamble" doesn't work when it's your kid's college fund you are gambling with.

No, you're missing the point. We're not talking wealth transfer taxes here (where the $5.3m applies), we're talking capital gain taxes.
If I give you $1.9m of cash then there is no tax liability because it's within my lifetime transfer allowance.
If I die and leave you $1.9m of cash then there is no tax liability because it's within my lifetime transfer allowance.
If I give you $1.9m of bitcoin where my basis is $100k then you don't pay tax on the receipt of the gift, but your basis is still $100k, just like mine was. So if you sell the bitcoins then you're still paying 15% tax on the $1.8m gain, regardless of whether you paid tax on the gift.
If I die and leave you $1.9m of bitcoin then your basis becomes the $1.9m they're worth on the day I die. You don't pay wealth transfer taxes or capital gains taxes.

The new tax reform fucks over the poor disproportionately and is generally kinda shitty. The personal exemption for a bigger deduction is not a good trade for example. Taxes can sometimes seem complicated but basically things got the way they did for a reason. The exemption and deduction are very different things which serve very different purposes.
The exemption is nothing more than a variable size 0% bracket linked to family size that exists under the other brackets. Logically you want that to be as high as reasonably possible and linked to cost of living, it exists to make sure that grocery/rent income isn't getting taxed. Currently it's set at $4,050 tax free dollars per household member.
The deduction is a completely different animal. The deduction exists to limit the tax penalties on socially positive expenses by allowing you to recover the taxes you paid on those expenses at your marginal tax rate. To reduce the cost of compliance you're allowed to assume $6,350 of socially positive expenses at the moment without providing proof. So you get taxes back at your marginal rate on the greater of $6,350 or what you can prove (with a bunch of bullshit Schedule A ceilings, floors, and other rules).
What this effectively means is that you "win" by having as few actually socially positive expenditures (charitable donations, paying for your own healthcare etc) as possible, giving you the biggest possible difference between your assumed $6,350 and what you actually spent. And you "lose" by having those expenditures at an amount near the assumed deduction, for example socially positive deductible expenditures of $6,400 would net you an additional refund of $12.50 ($50 * 25% tax bracket) over spending $0.
This tax plan abolishes the 0% bracket created by the exemptions. Now you're getting taxed on the poverty level living expenses with no allowance for family size etc. And it repays you by increasing the amount you can "win" by not making socially positive expenditures from ($6,350 * your marginal rate) to ($12,000 * your marginal rate).
What this means is that for anyone outside the 1% (where clearing $12k is a lot easier) most things just aren't deductible anymore.
Republicans like to say that the tax code is too complicated and that having exemptions + deductions is too hard but the people who built it knew what they were doing. And unfortunately so do the people voting to change it.
Probably the most obvious example of who this will hurt is anyone who regularly donates to charity (people who tithe at their church for example). But paying for your own healthcare expenses, paying state and local taxes, and a few things related to home ownership are all getting penalized.
The impact of that penalty decreases as the amount gets higher, someone who previously donated $13,000 goes from having a tax refund of $1,663 ((13,000-6,350) * assumed 25% tax rate) to $250 ((13,000-12,000) * assumed 25% tax rate). That's a 85% reduction in the tax benefit of charitable contributions for that person. Whereas someone who previously donated $130,000 goes from having a tax refund of $48,965 ((130,000-6,350) * assumed 39.6% tax rate) to $46,728 ((130,000-12,000) * assumed 39.6% tax rate). Their reduction is just 4% in their tax benefit.

Either way the poor are materially worse off.
It's no more a tax cut than a new credit card is a pay increase. All it does is hide the cost in the increased cost of government borrowing.

Debit cards don't have "cash advance" charges because you're not borrowing with them, you're simply accessing your own money. If you charge cash to a debit card you're simply withdrawing from the account.
Credit cards are typically for buying goods, up to your credit limit. They're not especially happy to extend you a cash loan up to your credit limit though. If they did that people would max out every credit card they had on the first of the month, hold the cash for 45 days and then repay on the 15th of the following month, before repeating.
Obviously people can still get cash from a credit card in a pinch, they could offer to buy things for other people and put them on their card or whatever. The credit card companies know that some people want to use their credit card to borrow cash so they added a cash advance function where you can buy cash with a credit card, but pay an extra fee. The cash advance limit is typically lower though.
Crypto was potentially a loophole area for people. They could buy a cryptocurrency with their credit card and have it charged as a purchase, then sell it immediately for cash to their bank account. By recategorizing cryptocurrency transactions as a cash advance the credit card companies protect themselves.
It's not really a big deal in my opinion. Credit cards aren't a good way to buy crypto anyway. Most exchanges have really low limits for credit card transactions and require a shitton of verification that you are the cardholder because if you subsequently contest the charge they have to prove beyond a crazy amount of doubt that it was genuine or the credit card company won't give them the money, even though there is no way for them to get their crypto back.

It is a bubble. Anyone who denies that doesn't know what a bubble is. Bitcoin may have some actual value, and it may even be higher than the current price, but that doesn't make it not a bubble. Right now the price of bitcoin is largely influenced by speculation, and the desire of speculators to get rich. People buy not because they think the bitcoin is worth the money, but because they think they'll be able to unload it to some greater fool down the line. That's bubble logic.
The underlying commodity doesn't need to be worthless for a bubble to exist. A bubble exists when the market is overtaken by a mania where irrationally buying something that you yourself believe is worthless becomes rational, as long as you plan to flip it before everyone else realizes that it's worthless.
The Dot Com Bubble was also a bubble. That doesn't mean the internet was worthless tech or that Amazon was overpriced back then, it means that the people driving up the stock prices were irrationally betting on the inflation of the market, rather than the stocks themselves.

No, these aren’t real loans. They’re coming from a company which is a related party and not in the business of giving loans to anyone else. They’re being given on payment terms that no real company would loan, and in amounts no real company would approve. With regard to tax obligations the IRS is actually allowed to reclassify your shit and tell you what they think you owe, they don’t have to use your books.
The rules that apply to real loans would never apply here in an audit situation because the IRS would never accept that these loans had any commercial substance. They’d say it was a dividend that the taxpayer fraudulently failed to report and go from there. And it literally doesn’t matter what OP says in reply, the IRS don’t care.
The only time when the IRS waive the right to adjust your books as they see fit regarding international transfers is if you go through the Advance Pricing Agreement Program. To do that you have to go to them ahead of time, tell them what you plan to do, show evidence that it has commercial substance and meets the arms length standard, and have them agree.

NHS is hugely underfunded compared to other healthcare systems. For example the US spends a greater portion of its GDP on government healthcare than the UK does, and yet people don’t have access to healthcare. The NHS is remarkable given the resource.

Gold isn't really money either to be fair. You could probably barter with it, to an extent. Like if you offered 10x the value of gold for groceries the next person in line would probably offer to put your groceries on their card and take the gold. But it's not a readily accepted currency in the US.

The man is a value investor. He's the guy who went to a Dairy Queen for a blizzard, thought to himself "this shit is good, people will buy this" and then bought Dairy Queen. He owns a lot of Coke, he owns a lot of Walmart, he owns the shit that he thinks people will use every single day. He's not gambling on a revolution, quite the opposite, he's betting that established brands will continue to capitalize on the customer base and reputation they've built over decades.
This sub often seems to have a hardon for some kind of feud with Buffett which is dumb as hell. Buffett doesn't hate bitcoin, he doesn't want to invest in it because it's not what he does. It's like a steakhouse trying to have a feud with a vegetarian cause they're not interested. What Buffett does is wait for Bank of America to offer him a ridiculously good deal if he loans them his name in 2008. The kind of deal where you'll never lose a cent.

The tax bill is closer to a flat tax than the status quo. It reduces the overall proportion of the total tax paid that the rich are paying considerably.
The government is spending more money than ever but the share of that that the rich are responsible for paying has gone down, while the share the middle class are responsible for paying has actually gone up.
Imagine you had previously planned to split an expense with another person where they pay $15 cash and you pay $5. They propose that you each put $10 on your credit card, insisting that that way you'll have an extra $5 in your pocket. The cash you have in your pocket might be slightly higher but the proportion of the overall liability that has to be paid has shifted against you.

While you're right that cancellation of debt is income, this isn't a real debt. The loans never had commercial substance, they were a cash transfer that was covered up by fraudulently misclassifying them as loans. The IRS won't fuck around arguing about whether or not the cancellation of debt was correctly reported, they'll just go straight for the fraudulent loans.

Hi, accountant here.
What you did was create an offshore shell company and pretend that the tax obligation belonged to the shell company, and not you. That might work, except you still needed to bring the money back on shore in order to use it, and that would mean a taxable distribution from the company, bringing you back to square one.
Your workaround for this is to create a series of structured transactions with no commercial basis, loans offered to a single related party on terms that no other similar company would offer to an unrelated party, with no expectation of repayment.
The IRS aren't stupid, and this isn't some new thing your accountant thought up. This has been around forever. When related parties (like you and your shell company) transact they often have to ask permission from the IRS ahead of time and show that their transactions have commercial substance. If they fail to do that, as you have, then the IRS will decide for themselves what they think is going on and then tax you accordingly. And they have the right to do that, they don't have to prove that you did it.
Your accountant presumably played the game where he feigns ignorance or tactfully makes you aware of the potential pitfalls while not asking any questions to cover his ass. Sucks to be him though because you were dumb enough to post about your illegal tax fraud on reddit, and how he helped you pull it off.
Good luck.

It assumes that your entire portfolio was traded at least once at FMV on 12/31. You don't need to end with 0 coins, you just need to have the recognized gain for the year equal the FMV minus the basis. In my case I was trading all through late Dec so it was pretty accurate. I may have overpaid a few dollars in tax but that'll all come back through a higher basis the following year.
I'm actually a CPA and do know how to track it properly. However, I was far more willing to spend 10 minutes and get my STCG accurate to within a few dollars than I was to spend a few hours and work them out exactly.

It's not on all assets, it's forced recognition of all deferred taxable gains. Essentially the way it works is that John Smith, US citizen, is treated as having sold all of his assets to John Smith, foreign citizen, and therefore John Smith, US citizen, owes taxes on all gains recognized through that sale. If you have cash in your pocket you won't pay an exit tax on that. If you have pre-tax money in your Traditional 401(k) then you're treated as if you cashed it out.
It actually makes perfect sense. A lot of tax law deals with recognition timing, the tax year that tax is owed on income. You can't just defer all your tax to a future year, renounce your citizenship and then beat the system.

I work in assurance, not tax, but my understanding is that the IRS don't care about people making good faith estimates of their crypto tax liability using reasonable assumptions, it's the guys who think crypto exempts them from tax that they'll go after. And as you say, it'll work itself over a few years.
Worst case scenario the IRS works out exactly what my tax liability was and asks for an extra few dollars (which is extremely unlikely in any case because they're terribly underfunded to the point that they don't have the resources to audit anyone where they don't expect to get a huge payout). But you don't get penalties etc for a reasonable estimate, that's only for attempted fraud.

You also need a motive, bitcoin discounts. Right now a plastic card will give you purchase protection, fraud protection, and 3% cashback, all of which comes baked into the cost of the product. When vendors knock 5% off of the price of your bill for using your bitcoin then people will use it.

This isn't correct.
The recipient of a gift never pays tax on the gift. Ever. It's the giver who has to pay the taxes.
The giver can give up to $5.34m (about to be uncapped by Trump) across their lifetime (and in their estate) without paying any tax. However, you don't need to record every time you put $20 in a Christmas card against that $5.34m limit. If you give less than $14k to an individual in a year then you don't need to count it against your limit at all.
People get these mixed up all the time, the $14k is just the threshold where you start to eat into your lifetime limit but you could give someone $14,001 every year for a few hundred years without ever owing a cent in tax.

Your basis in the asset is the value on the day you received it. While you are correct that you would have to pay taxes on gains once you sell the asset (as you would with any asset, receiving it as a gift is irrelevant), you only have to pay taxes on the gains over your basis. In this case you would have no gain, you received a gift worth $8k and you exchanged it for $8k, recognizing a $0 gain.
Hell, if you sold your bitcoin today you could recognize a $1,150 loss, count it against your regular income (you can deduct up to $3,000 of STCL), save $115 on your taxes ($1,150 deduction * 10% marginal rate), and then use the money to buy 1.02 bitcoin at your new basis of $6,965.

He's right. A good currency is one that people want to accept, one that makes them want to sell you goods and services for the currency you possess. You can't make bitcoin replace dollars by harassing grocery store clerks in Walmart, it actually has to offer something they need.

No, it's evasion. The transactions have no commercial substance lol. Avoidance would be structuring real transactions to minimize obligations. This is generating fake transactions to cover up income you brought onshore without paying taxes.

All of my gains were short term capital gains because I did crypto to crypto trades during the year. I took the value of my investments on midnight Jan 1, subtracted the dollars I'd paid through the year, and called that my STCG. Reported it as income and paid my taxes. Super easy, can be done by any idiot on turbotax.
It's actually going to work in my benefit because by paying taxes on the Jan 1 value I've now brought my basis up to that level. Whenever it drops below that level (which it now has) I can do crypto to crypto trades to create a STCL which I can deduct against up to $3k of my regular income. My 2018 tax rate is lower than my 2017 tax rate so I can effectively get money back from the tax man for it.
@_date: 2018-04-11 08:04:56
This is completely wrong.
Source: Am CPA.
Capital gains are either short term or long term. Short term capital gains are taxed at your marginal rate for income. Long term capital gains are taxed at a special lower rate which is dependent upon your marginal rate for income.
In the example of the gift the friend would have the tax liability on the deferred gain, not OP (unless the friend died and left it to OP). OP's basis in the gift is the price at which it was donated, $8,000, and therefore if he sells it for $8,000 he does not have a capital gain. The friend has a tax obligation on the unrecognized gain on the gift (unless OP is a recognized charity, you can donate assets with unrecognized gains to charities without first recognizing the gain).

STCG is taxed as income, you just add the gain onto whatever your regular income is and it is taxed at your marginal rate.
LTCG is taxed at a special rate dependent upon your marginal income. Basically you add the LTCG to your regular income and depending upon which regular income tax bracket the LTCG dollars would fall into they get assigned a rate. It sounds complex but basically the first $13,000 of your $30,000 would be tax free because that'd be in your 10% and 15% tax brackets, and the remaining $17,000 of your $30,000 would be taxed at 15% because it'd be in your 25% regular tax bracket.
Your basis in the bitcoin is whatever it was on the day your friend gifted it to you. That means if it was $8k that day and you sell it for $8k then you have $0 in gain. If your friend bought it for $6k then he owes taxes on the $2k gain, not you. Unrecognized gains on gifted assets must be recognized by the giver.
