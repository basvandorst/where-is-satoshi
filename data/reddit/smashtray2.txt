Hi, I was just wondering (regardless of softfork vs. hardfork, let's just say for the premise of this question that it was a "true" softfork) do you not like Segwit for a specific reason?

Noob question here.  Say Bob has a wallet with lightning enabled, would he then allocate 100mbtc to be on the coffeeshop "Channel" then not be able to spend them?  How does that affect Alice.  If she uses the same "channel"?

One of the reasons I like Bitcoin is all this Action!!!  I don't trade I just hold.  And I cashed out enough at $1,000 before the B(itcoin) Cash Fork that I have my initial investment back.  So I'm with you, this is very interesting with all these Alt-Coins people are freaking out over now.  Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Gold, Bitcoin Diamond all naming themselfs Bitcoin for some reason...  I remember Dogecoin-So Dreamy!! and Buttcoin, was Buttcoin an alt or just a sub?
@_date: 2017-12-13 08:16:59
Thanks for the reply.   Very interesting, I also wonder about on-line transactions using lightning.  I'm interested to know what kind of Channel-maps would be created. But I see how on chain transactions would be reduced for these repetitive smaller transactions.
@_date: 2018-08-25 00:49:36

Nice, I'm surprised no one has mentioned the NewEgg.com sale where they gave a 30% discount if you paid in BTC...  I'm still using my 2.5BTC, i5 Intel computer.  Got such a good deal back then. 
@_date: 2014-09-16 17:23:49
They do.  But not all the vendors they work with do.  So when you serch be sure to check the box to purchase from newegg only.

I Swear I will.  He's only 300 miles away, and I never quite know what to say.  But I am calling him for sure, I'll just ask how he's doing.  I wish I had some news to impress him... Maybe thats why I haven't called. I figured he would call me if he was bored.  BTW I'm 36 years old.  No wife no kids.  I can Assure you tho that just because your son dosent call DOES NOT mean he dosen't care.

Well I wanted a combo deal for a Mobo/cpu but combos were excluded for the deal.  So I got the following:

i5-4460 Quad-core 3.2GHz - 189.99
Corsair 16GB (2x8GB) DDR21866 - 159.99
DIYPC Case with USB 3.0 and lightup fans - 29.99
Total was $519.96 then with bitcoin discount it was  $376.95 or .7935 BTC - because of shipping.  FIRST TIME BITCOIN SPENDER!!!  So happy it worked great.  Now I guess I'll need to buy some bitcoin to replenish...

@_date: 2014-10-15 19:33:07
Upon taking a second look at this, I think that the reason that the majority of bitcoiners don't like this is because of the name in the title.  "Who REALLY uses bitcoin?" 
This makes it sound like people who use bitcoin are evil.
I think this post would have been more accepted if it was titled something like, "How the bad guys are turning to Bitcon".  It's still sensational and exciting, but also dosen't make an inaccurrate sweeping generalization.

Check out who Eliot Spitzer is.
He transferred arms to death squads by hiding them in "US humanitarian aid" to start civil wars to overthrow countries for Corporations profit.
If the US wanted Aid to go to Venezuela they could give it to the red cross. 
Instead the US imposed sanctions to starve the people and try to overthrow the democratic government. 
The last thing the "opposition" wants is an election monitored by the UN or Carter Center or anyone.  They would loose.  So they light fire to "aid" trucks in Columbia in order to gain traction for Trumps corporate coup.

I thought people on this Sub liked to learn about how fiat works.
But I see all are these comments about Socialism Vs. Capitalism.  It makes me think I'm reading r/TheDonald, or some other crazy conspiracy sub.
This has more to do with something called the "Petro-dollar".  Any country that goes against that is subject to this especially if their main export is Oil. 
Please learn more and research instead of Circle Jerking for fake internet points by parroting Fiat Elites.
Here is where you can start.  Try the 5 minute challenge- at least listen for 5 minutes!
US sanctions and Saudi Arabia over producing Oil to bring down the price along with a coup being planned by Trump.
Same as his predecessors.  Bush before him tried to kill Chaves.

If that was the most expensive lesson to date, good, you should now have learned to do research. (I assume your fairly young, and can recoup)  95% or higher of the alt/shit coins are scams. The others may offer unique stuff like being anonymous or being a good test ground for Bitcoin improvements.  But overall staying with the real crypto has benefits like the best devs and security.

I Agree, Also now that transactions have been upgraded to being cheap/fast, thru thoughtful upgrades to the protocol, I think Bitcoin will grow more naturally.
@_date: 2018-11-27 03:27:42
Great Points.  I agree but there are other, fundamental, things that make Bitcoin unlike a stock. I felt you left those out, but I see you are only regarding current price.  So with that perspective it makes sense to view it as a single stock. Thanks for your reply!  But also if it was a stock that was introduced in 2011 at .0001 cent, it's doing okay even at current price right?

Sorry you feel the need to troll on a throwaway account. 
 I'm guessing you FOMO'ed at the top and have lost money by selling low, why else waste time trolling.  I'm sorry for your loss.
  I do hear what I sound like, how long did e-mail exist before you used it?  That was a rhetorical question, I want you to look that up and be honest with yourself.  
The internet took years to be widely used and Bitcoin is the same type of system.  It is not going to just vanish, and people (who want to) will adopt it and use it as they see fit.
Don't invest more than you can lose in the future, and perhaps bitcoin is not for you.  
@_date: 2018-11-27 03:49:13
Okay, but GE was introduced as one of the original 12 company's on the Dow.  So you forgot to factor in the inflationary aspect of fiat currency. In 2018, GE ranked among the Fortune 500 as the 18th-largest firm in the U.S. by gross revenue.  
Whatever it was introduced at is worth more in today's dollars etc..
 Thanks for letting people know not to sell the farm, and their children's future on bitcoin.  I like how you say people could invest 3% and see how it goes.  
I know that at any point it could go to zero.  We post that all the time.

I agree, but it's still pretty cool.  This game is awesome.
@_date: 2018-11-27 03:20:00
Yeah, probably more like one in a million!!  LOL, but I hear where your coming from.  And It's sad that some businesses that used to accept it have dropped it.
But the point is that the internet didn't go away.  It is a system to exchange information quickly and easily.
Bitcoin/Blockchain is a system of trust.  It's the first digital scarcity, meaning you can't just copy or hack a bitcoin.
So the system of trust's most obvious use is currency, but later we will see smart contracts, easier and more trustworthy payment for taxi rides, home purchases, bets, etc...   
This is what makes Bitcoin different from ALT coins like BitcoinCash.  All the other coins are good for testing ideas, or scamming people, or money laundering etc...  But actual BTC is what all the greatest developers are focusing on while building the eco-system.  It will be around for quite awhile, and people will adopt and drop and buy and sell and hold and pump and dump.  But I for one am glad it was figured out, and like the prospects for it.  But it certainly is not for everyone.
@_date: 2018-11-27 01:37:29
Well, some people say they hodl,  But they still spend bitcoin and usually replenish what they spend.  So they still hodl the same amount overall.  That's what I do.  So just because they are not building, or don't know how to code, they are participating and adding to the overall idea.  I just say I'm a hodler because I don't day trade.  But you can still participate and not be just a speculator.

Bitcoin is not like a single stock.  Be open minded, learn more about it.

I've used an ATM before and had it make a paper wallet and also directly to Mycelium wallet.  Both times it shows up instantly, waiting for confirmations takes a minute maybe but it should have showed up instantly.  Definitely call the number they will be able to help for sure.

Look genius, the spelling of a word had nothing to do with the meaning of the comment anyhow.
My point stands.  Even if someone on the internet says they are responsible, that does not mean that they aren't doing propaganda.  Just saying your responsible doesn't make it fact.    
The elections were monitored by many.  But if someone, who claims they are responsible, says they aren't free elections.. Well forget the UN, forget the Carter Center, forget any group monitoring and claiming the elections are legit.  
Cause this dude on the internet says he's speaking "responsibly".  LOL,  Get out of here.

I was in Vegas about 1 month ago and used Bitcoin at the D in the gift shop with no problem and instant transaction.  I then went to the ATM at the D and took out $200 in USD from my BTC wallet on my phone.  That took 7 minutes to confirm and sent me a text to return to the machine and withdraw the money.  I also hear that the zipline on Freemont Street accepts BTC.  So you might be in for a happy surprise!
@_date: 2018-04-11 02:59:31
Bought some stuff in the giftshop using Mycelium wallet at normal fee and it was instant.  Then I used the ATM outside in the Casino to withdrawal $200 for gambling and that took about 7 minutes at normal fees to confirm.  The ATM texted me when it was confirmed and time to take cash from machine. 
@_date: 2018-04-11 04:34:31
Honestly it was overall more convenient than I expected at this point in BTC, especially using an ATM rather than a cashier in person (like in the giftshop).  The normal fee on Mycelenium was less than $1 I remember.  Same fee in gift shop was instant so that's odd.
-Edit spelling
@_date: 2018-04-23 04:06:51
I don't know.  Maybe there is an upper limit to how much you can pull out.  I only did $200 and that seemed to go fine.
@_date: 2018-04-23 01:34:18
When I used the ATM at the D casino it only asked for my phone number to text me once transaction was confirmed.  it took 7 minutes and worked fine using Mycelium wallet on my phone.  Never asked for ID or license.

It's the emergence of  the first instance of digital scarcity, made possible through mathematics actually.

Blockchain/Bitcoin is a network of Trust or Assurance in something solid and unhackable or breakable.

How dare you my good sir.
You are willing to assume that the internet could die off (to somehow prove a case that bitcoin would also die), but not assume people would resort to fail-safe measures?

It's the first instance of digital scarcity.  Peer to Peer money without a third party.  It dosen't even rely on the internet. 
 But it's a Network, and people at first, didn't understand the power of the internet.  They saw it as a fad.  Same is true with this network.  It's not going anywhere, it's out and people worldwide will use it. 
The internet network spread ideas and thought. 
The Blockchain network spreads Trust.

Yes.  People borrow money from a bank.  This bank is allowed to lend money it dosen't actually hold in reserves. It gets created on demand.  And Interest/debt is expected to be re payed upon this process.
The problem being that the money to re pay this interest does not exist.  So we have Quantitative easing, and more money printed, but only given to the rich in order to trickle down.
Please research **fractional reserve banking**.  That's the system that  is used in the US currently.

You agreed that it was created due to anyone asking for a loan.  And Quantitative Easing/distributing directly to the rich.

Rich sharks who sold paper that was supposed to represent bitcoin.  If they had bought bitcoin they would still have it, and be in a respectable spot even if they bought at a high based on the markets past.  But of course no body can predict what a market will do based on it's past.  
But those who own real private keys/bitcoin have some indicators (lightning network/Segwit) that show it's still growing and kicking.  A very resilient part of any portfolio.
The best way to get robbed by rich sharks is surely to put your dollars into a savings account, and watch inflation and money printing suck you dry.

Well, He said you can do more with bitcoins than cash, much like a banana...unlike cash, (and instead of eating them) you can instantly send them to your homies without a third party. Two parties is enough, after that, your just losing control. Too much partying leads to bad outcomes.
@_date: 2018-12-05 09:28:09
Obviously, without Internet access, the possibility to send and receive Bitcoins is significantly limited. In more general terms, Internet shutdowns weaken innovation and undermine users’ confidence in the future of digital currency.
There has been a lot of speculation around the topic with community members trying to imagine what would happen with Bitcoin if the entire Internet shuts down. Apparently, transactions with Bitcoin could still be possible even with no Internet connection. Some companies such as 37Coins suggest sending Bitcoin through the use of a third party SMS wallet provider. There is also a Finnish project called Kryptoradio which is researching possibilities of broadcasting Blockchain data over DVB-T.
So far, the Bitcoin community has proven to be extremely creative and open-minded. This makes all of us feel reassured- if the Internet shuts down, we will just take a deep breath and start sending and receiving Bitcoins through radio frequencies or through Morse code.
The internet replaced the BBS (bulletin Board System).  Before internet we would use modem and phone lines to call local BBS systems.  Or if we had money call long distance.  How old are you?
I don't get the craziness your saying about the moon.  But I assure you it's NOT made of cheese.
Yep, Bitcoin has taken 10 years to go from .06 cents to $3,500 US.  How long did that other thing, the internet, take to gain widespread adoption?

Hopefully Bitcoin.
Also you know the work that activists in America have fought for Amazon to get to $15.  
Originally US minimum wage was meant to be a living wage, where you did not need government assistance if you worked full time.  
Amazon and others like Walmart grew using tax payers to subsidize employee's wages by having them apply for food stamps and welfare.  I am glad some have recently slightly shifted perspectives.  And seemingly rely less on tax-payers for profits.

I Think it would be a pain in the ass to try to weigh all the gold and use it as a currency.  everyone would need to carry a scale and have to be able to shave off amounts of gold to do transactions. 
Then if you had a good amount, you may need to melt it into a bigger denomination. I think I'd rather use bitcoin via morse code and simple telegraph lines.  I mean you have taken us into some dystopian ideas, but bitcoin is strong in this scenario.
You say Bitcoin is missing core components that make it viable for use as currency.  What "gaping holes" are you now envisioning?

Especially if all these central banks can print "money" at their whims?

You are getting the term "Third Party" mixed up.  
A Third party is like a privately owned bank dealing with other powers to decide if you should have first say in the money of yours they control.
Similar to the bitcoin network, no one will ever own or control the Lightning Network.
The code is open source and free for anyone to download and review.
Anyone can run a node and be part of the network.  It's a part of the decentralization idea you should check out.

Well, you do admit that we are using a currency that is not sound. 
You claim that this is necessary to grow an economy.
History of money.  
 This is not a "free" or "sound" way to use money.  Especially now that gold standard is gone and money equals speech.  It's like saying someone who was born rich has a birthright to a greater say in our society, than the average citizen.

Actually, If it came to it, Bitcoin would still operate over radio or morse code, maybe even sms text messages on your phone or whatever we use by then.
