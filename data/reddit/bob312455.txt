If people start to notice that their transactions aren't going through in a timely manner then they will increase their fees, it's not like anyone has an issue with paying a few cents for a transaction anyway.

Delaying someones payment would only make sense if it was high value, and if it was high value the person sending it would likely include a high fee, in which case the transaction would get processed anyway.  As for the coinbase example that would only hurt bitcoins reputation as well as whoever was doing the attack so it would be counterproductive.
The point I was making is they would have to have a continual stream of coins to keep the attack going, meaning they have to either already have them or continue buying them, if they continue buying them then the price increases and everyone waits for the attack to stop, and all high value transactions go through anyway because they would likely be using higher fees.
Raising the blocksize would increase the cost of doing this type of attack as well though.

These 2 charts show exactly what I'm talking about, as transaction volume increases so do the fees paid to miners, blocksize should not change that.

What? that's never been the case, the fees haven't fallen to zero now and the blocks aren't full, why would that change?

I'm almost to that point myself, this is supposed to be a decentralized currency, not an interbank settlement system.

No, I just hope it doesn't become only the latter,  if it scales then it can be both.

The problem with being an attacker in this way is eventually they would run out of bitcoins, the price would rise (because they were buying more bitcoins to continue the attack) and less people would sell, so it seems it would hurt them overall and only effect the network for awhile while at the same time increasing their costs to continue.
It's possible some people would sell under these conditions but I think that most would just wait it out until the attacker had no money left.

If the blocksize is not increased however then micropayments will be a thing of the past and the entire network will only be used for large amounts. as for fees, the network can do either 1. large fees for fewer amounts of users, 2. many smaller fees for a lot of users. as the network scales the amount of fees will increase as well, so even if the fee amount stays similar to 0.0001 coins per transaction if there are many transactions then there will still be sufficient fees, even if we got to just paypal (which would be impressive) the 10 million transactions per day would then make the miners 1000 bitcoins per day even at current fees, which yes is less than the 3600 block reward per day, but by the time we get to that scale the value of bitcoins will likely be higher as well.

Or, they could use bitcoin for the elections, hand out a small amount of coins to each member then have them send those coins to the address of the specific people they want to vote for.

As far as voting anonymously I can see how it would be a problem.  I was thinking more of a system that assumed to trust the people giving out the coins.  Which could also be a problem.
-edit- ah, yeah I guess I can see how there would be more problems than I would have thought of at first.
