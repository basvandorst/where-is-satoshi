If you start valuing some tx more than others you will end up with only elite tx being included in the blocks. Then nobody can rely on bitcoin anymore, because nobody can be sure if they won't be excluded for any reason.  
Central control and fee market essentially both have this effect.

Compare those graphs (both have the same timescale):
  
tx/s increases slowly over several days, but the blockchain can keep up with it until nov 21. It is just that there are generally more tx than what can be included in blocks, and this excess just builds up to create this massive load in mempool. There is nothing special with the number of transactions in the last days, it's just that the normal growth exceeded the capacity at some point.

It is true, but also was written in 2011
So, we are waiting for the opportunity? How long? 2 years, 6 years - yes we already waited 6 years. Now 6 more years, or 20?
Back when the essay was written, Bitcoin was the only functional cryptocurrency out there. Today several altcoins are already technically better than bitcoin. The way bitcoin can keep up is to keep going.
What gwern wrote about is "Worse is Better", the principle that you get something working and imperfect instead of perfect and not working. What Alex B. says is; we have time to work on the perfect solution, no need to make bitcoin functional so soon.

So you really *do* believe it. In this case let me point you to [George Lakoff](
We start from different assumptions. Because those are so vastly different we won't be able to discuss on an analytical level - you won't understand me and I don't understand you. But we can look at the underlying assumptions and trace the causality from this starting point to our conclusions. Then we will see that both our opinions are in itself coherent and logical, but only in the frame we set out.  
Seriously, listen to that talk if you have the time. And if you have the time to make lengthy post on reddit you probably have the time.
What is your goal? What is Bitcoins goal? Is the use case of a settlement layer the goal itself or a way to reach it? Is it to make early adopters rich? To bank the unbanked? To replace all fiat?
@_date: 2016-11-08 19:59:59
You are right. That's how blocks are decided on. But development of the software was up till now always a matter of consensus (or "as good as concensus"). Like in most bigger open source software projects. When concerns where raised they where addressed.
Now we have the situation that there are concerns, but they get ignored. It's not a matter of "is this block valid", it's about the whole code and economics of the currency. Nothing where we should just ignore a good portion of the network.

Transactions are bundled into blocks roughly every ten minutes. When a transaction is in a block it is accepted by the network. Currently the size of blocks is limited to 1MB. Which effectively limits the number of transactions per second. There are proposals to get rid of this limit, so that miners and nods can decide on which limit they want collectively.
@_date: 2016-11-23 21:06:56
I am aware of the problem. But on which basis do you claim this to be an attack rather than just legitimate tx building up in the mempool?

I'm glad the internet separates you and me, so we can talk without violence.


I guess attacks like this will very likely happen in the beginning. It comes down to the formula: If they separate in peace, both win. If they separate in war, both lose. The important part is that either *both* win or *both* lose, it's very unlikely that one will succeed (just because the network is build to be resistant).  
However war is costly, so after some time the attacks will calm down and there will be two stable currencies.
Look at all those scrypt coins, they exist side by side. Or the etherums. There are even several SHA-256 coins of all sizes which haven't been crushed by bitcoin by now. The question is, what prevented such attacks by now, and how can we extend on this.
Saying that bitcoin could fork doesn't imply that everything has to be the same. There could be intentional alterations that make both coins incompatible.


They would be doubled. (As for "people will be confused", that's implementation details - something that can be solved.)


and *I* think I'd settle for a different altcoin to hold my value if bitcoin remains in this situation. Think about it. The only reason bitcoin is the Nr 1 is because it was the first, because it is the standard. Some altcoins offer better alternatives by now. If the fees remain as high there is no reason to use bitcoin at all.
@_date: 2016-11-19 15:33:09
TIL I'm a sock puppet.
@_date: 2016-11-23 20:41:46
Or maybe it is because high fee tx get included into the blocks and only low fee tx are left over to build up in the mempool.
@_date: 2016-11-29 08:01:53
Why is it so hard for some to believe that it was legitimate use? Because that would mean that the 1MB limit caused the problems.
@_date: 2016-11-29 08:09:29


That's an assumption on your side. The argument is actually: as more people use bitcoin, the bitcoins become more scarce and therefor more expensive.


Are you serious?
@_date: 2016-12-09 10:53:28
Yes, write access is privileged. Only the rich can afford it.
@_date: 2016-11-29 19:44:01
Bitcoin was made as an alternative to fiat. Now you are telling me a legitimate use case is only when it does something else than to replace fiat?
Do you honestly believe this or are you just trolling? In either way, I think discussion in worthless.
@_date: 2016-12-20 18:08:03
You can actually use bitcoin without running a full node.

Left over tx add up over time. Take a look at the [graph of tx/second]( There is no attack. The only reason the mempool spills over is because there is an artificial block size limit.
@_date: 2016-11-29 21:10:00


I agree on that one. The question is, which problem? (I have my guess what you mean but don't want to push in a certain direction.)
Then you are doing some jumps I can't follow.  
First, your ideal money is stable over long periods of time - do you mean robust, or stable in price? And how does this solve social problems?  Second, where does bitcoin in it's current state lack those properties? How do they change when it becomes a settlement layer?  
Third, when bitcoin becomes a settlement layer and we have lighting, then it will still be used for buying coffee, just on sidechains, there will still be the total amount of bitcoins and so forth.
