That is true and an important way of looking at it but I have two concerns:
A: my knowledge in blockchain and BITCOIN is limited and I am trying to look towards improving it. Any suggestions from experience will help. 
B:Although people say only invest what you can afford to lose, well I am going all in and trying to ensure that I make sound decisions ensuring that I covered every avenue. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 04:44:41
Will do, thank you
@_date: 2017-12-03 04:47:01
I need to verify on gdax and will but hardware ledger tomorrow or Monday
@_date: 2017-12-03 04:06:08
Brand new
@_date: 2017-12-28 20:45:37
What is mycelium or electrum?
@_date: 2017-12-27 21:04:34
I mean which processes I can use this in
@_date: 2017-12-03 03:35:17
Yes, say I buy at 5, goes to 10, exit at 8 whilst the crash stops at 2. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 05:31:49
Thank you, will search for them individually
@_date: 2017-12-03 10:15:10
Exactly, wish there was a definitive way of reducing risk
@_date: 2017-12-03 03:27:58
Yeah but without panick selling caused due to flash crash, I need programmers I think but not sure what we will have to account for 
@_date: 2017-12-03 03:50:52
Thank you, so in a flash crash second scenario would be devastating
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:29:08
What a fake website and poor attempt of advertising
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:44:13
Coinbase is a rip off right now
@_date: 2017-12-03 04:09:53
Yes, something like nano or trezor
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:07:25
Bitstamp and coindesk are 800 dollars apart!
@_date: 2017-12-06 14:16:46
Can I ask what is the direct site
@_date: 2017-12-25 17:30:03
Interesting thank you
@_date: 2017-12-03 03:34:00
No lol, I am just making sure I don't lose out if it does crash significantly
@_date: 2017-12-03 05:01:21
Can I ask, when you say purchase on coinbase, doesn't coinbase have high fees
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:42:42
It's a prediction based on what I am hearing.
@_date: 2017-12-03 09:40:03
So there is no recourse or protection if it were to crash
@_date: 2017-12-16 18:39:32
So electrum is a software
@_date: 2017-12-03 03:51:53
So how would one guarantee sale during flash crash?
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:07:31
Pure disregard for this is fucking alarming.
@_date: 2017-12-03 04:52:01
Nothing at all. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 14:53:19
I will open another thread for asking the same question as to why people believe it will crash
@_date: 2017-12-03 04:50:32
Leap of faith, or a huge leap towards the unknown. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 04:10:38
Nothing at all. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 04:10:05
@_date: 2017-12-03 16:04:03
So we only need an exchange like gdax or kraken to go down
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:16:07
So go with the flow
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:54:04
It sunk
@_date: 2017-12-16 17:30:13
Can I ask what electrum is
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:53:52
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:58:06
Important question when will it crash?
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:27:05
Can I please ask on what basis is the growth unsustainable?
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:28:34
Everywhere I hear that is what is being speculated
@_date: 2017-12-07 07:23:40
It's there's guide on the 5 dollar test?
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:12:33
Wow so it will drop to that point, no more 100k dream
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:00:18
What's happening I am out of the loop
@_date: 2017-12-16 18:40:25
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:53:26
Evidence of venture capital investments
@_date: 2017-12-03 16:03:17
What do you think will make it fall next
@_date: 2017-12-23 04:14:30
I am interested too, if there was a guide it would help
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:26:26
That's a great insight. So you are disagreeing with other people who say bitcoin will crash in a few days. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:13:23
That's amazing
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:05:30
So what's going to happen to bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-03 10:12:10
Interesting point
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:42:01
So you are saying it is imminent.
@_date: 2017-12-03 10:13:01
But on time of choosing could be completely uncorrelated with market movement
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:19:56
Interesting, is there more on this?
@_date: 2017-12-25 14:22:02
Can I ask what does withdrawal mean and what trading volume numbers refer to.
@_date: 2017-08-09 09:25:23
Wouldn't that be a huge problem not knowing where your remainder balance is? 
Also is there an easy guide to purchase one bitcoin in UK pound currency?
@_date: 2017-08-09 01:27:47
Can I please ask what sweep means?
@_date: 2017-09-16 23:39:29
@_date: 2017-09-14 21:21:27
Great post, would this be considered trading
@_date: 2017-09-17 02:11:14
Best wishes
@_date: 2017-09-14 21:22:26
@_date: 2017-09-14 11:37:11
Can I ask where to see these charts
@_date: 2017-09-14 23:14:02
This may seems stupid but what if you are only dealing with a fraction of money. Say you only want to invest $500-550 or say large amount of 40000-45000 . Would your guide still apply. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 22:48:52
In your experience what websites or platforms or advice forums have you come across that should be paid attention to. The reason I ask is because you have managed to take the big steps and I am too getting there but Reddit is proving to be a very poor place for proper information.
@_date: 2017-09-16 12:28:47
That confuses me too
@_date: 2017-09-17 21:06:23
What is 2fa and what should be done if not SMS or email
@_date: 2017-09-16 13:48:25
What would be the benefit of that
@_date: 2017-09-15 16:43:46
Good question
@_date: 2017-09-16 12:31:25
So gdax is not at trading value of btc
@_date: 2017-09-15 16:43:46
Good question
@_date: 2017-09-14 23:14:02

@_date: 2017-09-16 13:56:16
Thank you, would this be fixed at all
@_date: 2017-09-13 22:25:15
Good question, I tried looking and couldn't find any guide or anything
@_date: 2017-09-14 21:16:36
0.7 is not big enough, now this is where it becomes a problem and you can't ask the authorities for help either. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 21:21:27
Great post, would this be considered trading
@_date: 2017-09-14 21:22:26
@_date: 2017-09-16 17:04:10
Can I ask what the limit is on gdax
@_date: 2017-09-14 23:08:15
That I can fully agree with. But that could be perhaps a bunch of people saw that ark consistently had a rising trend during the bit co fiesta and decided it was the saviour. 
@_date: 2017-09-17 17:00:05
What about English
@_date: 2017-09-16 16:55:21
Can I ask of examples and what EFT means
@_date: 2017-09-14 21:37:15
What about UK
@_date: 2017-09-17 21:32:16
I see
@_date: 2017-09-17 19:47:35
I suppose
@_date: 2017-09-14 21:16:36
0.7 is not big enough, now this is where it becomes a problem and you can't ask the authorities for help either. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 23:45:53
Which market would that be right now
@_date: 2017-09-14 02:18:08
Can I ask what the price of this is? How did you jeopardize it?
Also what are the benefits of disadvantages of using this storage method?
Any advice will really help. Thank you
@_date: 2017-09-17 20:50:10
Close Ur effing account and open different. Teach them a lesson.
@_date: 2017-09-14 21:24:03
Could you please explain what this means, thanks
@_date: 2017-09-15 16:01:32
I think it all makes sense. Ofcourse it does. I am confident in saying you could actually time these events and know when the fluctuations will take place. If only bitcoins future was promising, so much time could be invested into it.
@_date: 2017-09-17 02:08:59
Hot damn 3 and not 300
@_date: 2017-09-16 14:19:02
This is really interesting. I guess this practice is in use on large scale by traders.

@_date: 2017-09-15 17:18:14
How everyone didn't see this coming is surprising
@_date: 2017-09-14 21:24:03

@_date: 2017-09-19 10:43:31
Interesting, expected
@_date: 2017-10-30 17:49:11
Is there a guide on this
@_date: 2017-09-14 23:08:15
That I can fully agree with. But that could be perhaps a bunch of people saw that ark consistently had a rising trend during the bit co fiesta and decided it was the saviour.

What about UK
@_date: 2017-09-14 02:20:23
What credibility did you have op? I am asking as a newbie
@_date: 2017-09-09 14:39:51
How to place this order, using what platform?
@_date: 2017-09-16 12:49:33
That just means gdax is no better than other platforms when it comes to price competitiveness
@_date: 2017-09-14 21:14:15
What do you think people are not paying attention to or what is being manipulated to be what. Thanks
@_date: 2017-09-16 16:55:36
How would that work, thanks
@_date: 2017-09-14 23:23:34
Can I ask which charts do you use for your analysis, thanks
