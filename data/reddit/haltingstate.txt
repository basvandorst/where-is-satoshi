The mining pool could give you H(S) without you knowing S. So it is still possible for you to generate blocks for the pool if you only use H(S).
If you can generate a hash for S, without knowing S then it does not work. You can generate hashes for H(S) without knowing S.
Its counter-intuitive. 3rd parties must be able to verify the hash without knowing S. However, you should only be able to generate hashes if you know S. If those two requirements are met, it works.

Instead of the nonce, you hash in the transaction body hash with the secret. Then they cannot download a torrent of precomputed values.

This means the characteristic 2 NIST curves are compromised. Bitcoin uses secp256k1, which has large characteristic, so this algorithm does not apply. However, it affects the ECC used on HTTPS and SSL.
Also, in Bitcoin, the public key is not published until you use the address in a send. So your Bitcoin are safe, as long as you dont reuse addresses.
Current state of the art ECC cracking, allows breaking keys with ~100 bits in about 600 CPU hours. Bitcoin uses 256 bits. This paper may reduce the security and allow larger keys to be broken with the same effort.

Dogecoin is a gateway drug into Bitcoin. Banning Dogecoin would be a mistake.
In the long term, we should not be invested in Bitcoin. Its the idea of Bitcoin that matters, Bitcoin is just a particular implementation and we should encourage competition and innovation.
People are losing prospective on Bitcoin. Everyone who was in Bitcoin from the beginning, understands that it was an experiment. Satoshi was not invested in Bitcoin, but created it as a proof of concept. Half the Bitcoin that exist are lost permanently. They were in wallets that were deleted by people, when thousands of Bitcoin were worth less than a penny.
People did not think to back up a wallet with $3 in coins in it, that are worth millions today. In the long term, Bitcoin as an implementation will probably fail. The core developer and people who have been here from the beginning acknowledge that, but are guarded because of the financial interests.
If Dogecoin succeeds at getting people to adapt cryptocurrencies, we should do everything we can to encourage it.
Dogecoin is a positive development and has gotten many more people involved with cryptocurrencies than would otherwise have occurred. Dogecoin is very popular among teenagers and people who cannot afford to own a whole Bitcoin. Any media attention directed at Dogecoin, also improves the visibility, legitimacy and mindshare of Bitcoin.

- They work for the foundation
- The existing developers are good and can be trusted
- What gets included is decided by the foundation, who controls the source code
- Hundreds of people have contributed to the source code however. Anyone can submit changes and they will be approved as long as they are approved by a foundation developer who controls the github repository.

It has happened to a large number of people. That is just the people who the news bothered to report about.  They have seized over five billion in assets through this program, just in California.
They tried reducing the limit to one year, from three.




They were sued for seizing and auctioning the property before notifying people.


They now pretend to try to find the person who owns the account, before seizing it.


I have even know someone who had their box drilled and all items removed and then box replaced with box with identical lock. The bank admitted it, but then said they were not liable under the contract because they followed the requirements set by state and did not violate their policy or contract.
In another case, a bank refused to deposit a check into an account (rejected the deposit). However, the bank debited from the account the check was drawn against, but the deposit was "refused" by the receiving bank and never credited to the account cashing the check. The bank just kept the money with no recourse.

In California, the government is seizing safe deposit boxes at banks, that have been "abandoned". A women lives two blocks from bank and cashes checks there every week.
She checks her safe deposit box and California declared it "abandoned property" after a year and auctioned off $300,000 in jewelry and stock certificates that were in her "abandoned" safe deposit box.

I have met people like this, and income/success is often overstated. Its confidence trick.
You announce your company was sold and friends leak rumors for amount that is much larger than actual amount. You show up with expensive house you borrow from friends and start throwing large parties with hot girls and wooing Chinese investors.
Even someone making 30k/year can appear to be successful and have money, if they spend all their money on clothing. 200k/yr from advisory roles buys you a lot of bling.
People with actual money and power, stay out of the spotlight.

Three years. They require documents to be stored for five years after abandoned property law sets in. The threshold in California is currently three years and they are trying to reduce it to one year.
In NY it is five years, but may be lowered if there is another budget crisis.

A lot of the early Bitcoin people sold at pennies. Some of the early people sold when it hit $1 because they never imagined it would get that far. Going from 0.00000000000045 to $1 is like "whoa".
Many of the earliest people had $2 in Bitcoin in their wallets. Deleted the wallet by accident, forgot password or reformatted hard drive or did not back them up. The coins were not worth anything at the time, but are worth millions of dollars now.
I think about half of the earliest Bitcoin are lost permanently.

I have met Brock. He is OK. Honestly, is a bit of an asshole.
I first met Brock at a Canadian consulate event at E3. I didnt know who he was and my impression was "wow, that person is an asshole". I did a background check on him and found the Den stuff. I thought the DEN video on Fuckedcompany was hilarious. 
I dont think Brock has done a good job handling the allegations and putting it behind him. 
The issue is that there is one guy who is making allegations against multiple people. The same person made allegations against DEN, Bryan Singer and Brock Pierce. He is now 30 and claims that when he was 14 he was drugged, and raped at gun point by these people. He was living in mansion with Den executives and Brock during the Den saga.
Brock is controversial because of the people he was involved with.
Brock is well connected and a potential asset, especially because of his Chinese relationships, but is also deeply flawed.
Brock has a Guanxi interpersonal style, which is alienating for western aspie tech business business people and can come across as shady or manipulative to westerners. However, he gets along very well with the Asian business culture and has valuable connections in Asia.
I dont know him well enough personally to defend him. My personal assessment, is that he had not handled the allegations against him well. I also feel like he alienates a lot of non-bullshit tech people.
Powerful people in Western business tend to be unassuming and modest. They dont seek attention and are only concerned with their ability to do what they need to. Brock seems attracted to media attention and wants to be in the spotlight. Very Hollywood.
Handling controversy is one of the requirements for a public facing role. Ideally, you want someone with good communication skills, who comes across as reliable and trustworthy. You want to avoid these kinds of controversies because they distract from the mission of the foundation.
You dont want to give the enemies of Bitcoin in the media any ammunition to shoot us with. However, in Brock's case, I think it is simply difficult to find a better representative in the community right now.
People joining the foundation are going to receive a lot of scrutiny from the media and may be targeted for harassment by the government in the event of a crackdown. I see the Bitcoin foundation more as a target list than anything else.
The reality is that the foundation does not do anything. The people doing real work dont have time for it.

We will have open source ASIC miners soon , just as we had open source GPU miners after a while.  The circuit for implementing a miner on an FPGA is trivial and it is only a matter of people and cash to go from FPGA to structured ASIC production run.
We dont need asicminer or organize this effort.  Structured ASIC miners are not actually faster than graphics cards.  They have lower G/hashes per dollar but higher G/hashes per watt than graphics card mining.
Here is the research paper "An FPGA Based SHA-256 Processor" which used the Pilchard FGPA board open ASIC is using.  
According to article the board does 80 MB/s of hashing.

When slaves revolt or during protests, the slave owners tell the slaves to be calm and not escalate to violence. They promise to make concessions. Then as soon as the threat has passed, they come in and violently murder the leaders of the revolt. Throughout history, for hundreds of years that has been the pattern.
Violence is legitimate if used by the masters, but violence is illegitimate when used by the subjugated. The masters putting down the slaves is "restoring law and order" and the slaves resisting domination is insurgency, violence, subjugation is insurgency and anarchy.
The elites, disarm the other elites. The first thing they do, is disarm the targeted rebelling population. They declaw the animal so that it cannot retaliate. Then they massacre the leadership of the revolt.
I am getting out of the country before the purges start. The US is replicating the black sites and methods of torture and terror used overseas, for domestic operations now. People are leaving the CIA and writing books about what the new government should look like after the war.
The government is so completely illegitimatized it is disturbing. Obama signed an order to drone strike a funeral, because someone they may have wanted to kill, may have shown up. So they killed everyone at the funnel. The elites in other countries, in France, in Germany, in Russia are looking at the US elites in disgust, like we are the Nazis. 
No one in the government believes there is any hope for political reform. The people leaving the government, the media and even CIA are involved in fermenting violence. Even the mainstream media is encouraging an enemy mentality towards police. Mainstream media is running stories on the government perceiving the citizens as enemies to be crushed, that only Alex Jones would publish before. There is elite support in whatever is brewing.
Bankers are other elites are buying land in New Zealand, outside of the east Asia, eastern Europe and Latin American conflict zones. The warning signs are here and people should begin preparing. They should protect themselves and get out of the conflict zone. We have a mixture of global regional wars, global financial collapse from the sovereign defaults and civil war coming up.

Coinbase is trustworthy as a company, but I do not believe they are FinCEN compliant.  They are not registered as a money transmitter in the states in which their customers are located.
The Coinbase "user agreement" specifically states "Coinbase is not a money transmitter. Coinbase assists its users in Bitcoin transactions".
Over two thirds of existing bitcoin exchanges have failed to date and the US government has not even intervened yet.  Regardless of the legal theory under which the exchanges believe themselves to be compliant with US FinCEN regulations, its likely that accounts will eventually be seized.
Coinbase is also violating the California Money Transmission Act registration requirement, but this is very selectively enforced.  Coinbase is one of the companies being sued by Greenspun over the selective enforcement of the CA MTA law

Bitcoin was merely the first cryptocurrency and it wont be the last or best cryptocurrency. Bitcoin may not be the dominate currency in five years. Many of the Bitcoin developers have acknowledged that Bitcoin is just the beginning and that they will move some of their assets into alternatives if a legitimate successor to Bitcoin appears.
Bitcoin is an idea. Bitcoin owners may suffer if Bitcoin declines as the dominant currency, but the community will survive and prosper.
Litecoin however does not represent fundamental innovation over Bitcoin.
"It dilutes the efforts and the funding of the Crypto-community. Instead of uniting behind one crypto, people would work on building one ecosystem against the other"
No.  Litecoin and Bitcoin are almost the same. Only difference for users is the logo.
We need multiple exchanges in case one exchange fails or is taken down, we need multiple wallets to support innovation in usability and we need multiple coins to support innovation at the core. Multiple projects are started and later projects adapt the best attributes of previous projects. That is how the community evolves.
