From my (very short) experience with coinbase, the ask price is always a ~$2-$4 higher than the "live" price...
What is the next best wallet option with lower fees?

Thank you. Excuse my ignorance, but when I log in to Coinbase, it says my coins are in a "BTC Wallet"?

I'm worried that this same might be true for LIFO?
@_date: 2018-01-22 17:25:23
Would you not trust software such as bitcoin.tax which supposedly calculated this for me?
@_date: 2018-01-29 14:15:12
Is anyone else using LIFO on their taxes?
@_date: 2018-01-29 16:21:32
I like Bitcoin.tax  
From the research I've done, if you're in the US, I would not use average price method. The IRS probably won't be cool with that.

Articles like this are what have me hesitant to use LIFO:

Same here. I haven't been able to log in for over an hour on APP or browser  
Good news, the price dropped since then so saved me some $$ when I was going to buy

Got it. Thanks.

Noob question: If transferring to a mobile wallet, are the coins only stored on that device (e.g. if my phone is stolen, are my coins gone along with it)?
@_date: 2016-12-26 00:41:32
yeah. I should have bought the dip!
@_date: 2016-12-25 04:18:52
Any news?
@_date: 2016-12-26 06:37:01
Yes, this arbitrage opportunity has been documented recently. The caveat here will be the Coinbase processing lag time. 
@_date: 2016-11-18 03:12:08
Thank you

Use limit and stop loss orders....

This happens every time there is a big swing. Unless you're new to this, you should expect it. I am not defending Coinbase, but especially with their user growth - they just can't keep up. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:20:03
Your cost basis will include your fees. So technically, yes.

Regarding LIFO:  
You state, "It’s important to keep and maintain detailed records to support the method used."  
Please be more specific as to what constitutes a detailed record. Would the transaction histories from each exchange be sufficient? 
@_date: 2018-02-02 15:25:12
What sources did you use to determine that this was acceptable? 
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:19:25
@_date: 2018-03-05 21:46:14
But you can choose to us FIFO for one coin and LIFO for another, correct?
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:17:16
Answer is not clear. Are you going to use LIFO for any of your clients?


@_date: 2018-02-01 19:20:21
Not unless you sold or traded
@_date: 2018-03-06 14:10:40
I'm confused.  
I know you must use the same for all your trades (in regards to each asset), but couldn't I for example choose LIFO for all my BTC trades, and FIFO for all ETH trades?
@_date: 2017-05-26 19:35:03
But determining where we are in the spectrum of fear to despair is the difficult part 
@_date: 2017-05-26 19:41:59
I agree. This is of course assuming that it will inevitably go up in the long run. 
@_date: 2017-07-19 19:27:57
Aww
