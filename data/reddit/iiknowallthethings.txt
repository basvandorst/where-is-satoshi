Life or death compared to having zero of something that didn’t exist before? What the actual fuck? What a terrible ass analogy. if you were that worried, you shouldn’t of had your btc on an Exchange in the first place

if he steals your money, you take him to small claims court.
 ‘We’re living in a society!!!’
but seriously, that sounds super dumb. It’s not the same thing at all, since your bank promises it will be there when you go to pulled out. And it’s backed by the FDIC.

people keep saying that coin base employees profited off of this, but there’s no actual proof of that. All I ever saw was the trading was halted, including purchase of bitcoin cash. I keep hearing people talk about people who got screwed by purchasing bitcoin cash at 8 or $9000, but I haven’t heard anyone specifically say that happened to them. Sources on any of that? maybe you’re right they should have had more of a notice that it was being added to the exchange, but the rest is all conjecture

how is this upvoted? insider trading does not ‘specifically refer to the illegal practice’. there are legal ways to do so. insider trading is just trading with insider information. what a dumb comment. nobody who speaks English needs the spelled out definition for that phrase, it defines itself

excited for Monero because of profitability? Or you mean as an actual currency? Because all I’ve heard is that it’s not much better than bitcoin in terms of scalability

this is from the FUCKING SEC WEBSITE:
Insider Trading
"Insider trading" is a term that most investors have heard and usually associate with illegal conduct. But the term actually includes both legal and illegal conduct.

I mean, it was definitely the biggest. ‘Decentralized’ has been the main point of all the cryptocurrencies, Even if most of them haven’t really achieved that because of centralized mining pools or nodes

I keep going because they’ll take any return no matter what. It’s like a lifetime warranty on clothes

Great analogy, but I guess I missed your point. the bank still owns the asset, whether it’s the house or the money that replaces it. So it belongs to the bank, and until it’s paid off, you’re really just a steward. Just like a bank is with my money. Are you arguing for me or against me?
