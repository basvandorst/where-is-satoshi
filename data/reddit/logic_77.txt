What other options are there? Is there anything that doesn't charge ridiculous fees and doesn't take a whole week to buy/sell?

I should've thought about that before. RIP to my coins now lol

Just make sure you remember your seed. I lost the paper mine was in and lost all my coins.

Fucking transferred my coins from my coinbase to electrum because I was told I could lose all my coins and now I can't log back into it. Rip.

I'm kinda new to all this but I'm guessing etf is part of the stock right and they got denied?

Do you recommend any? I don't really know much about Bitcoin so I had no idea.
@_date: 2017-03-11 01:44:02
Wait so what does this mean? Im coming from all and bought Bitcoin a while back and just have it hanging out in coinbase.
@_date: 2017-03-11 02:20:52
Why did Bitcoin price go down the toilet today?

So I just bought and I feel like I made a great mistake.

I'm not an expert so I'm not sure if every exchange does or doesn't but stuff like coinbase charges you a fee every time you buy or transfer to an outside wallet. And no problem it's kind of difficult at first since people throw out all these words at you but if you stick around you'll get it in no time.

Yeah you can buy as much as you want. Like lets just say you want to buy $100 it will be like 0.01 something of a coin instead of the full coin.

It seems like more news are coming out that's gonna make it go down more.
