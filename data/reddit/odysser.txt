(re-post from r/btc)
The problem with this post is that the analogy sucks. - It wouldn't suck if you had a magical way to shard the Bitcoin Network in a secure, decentralized, and safe way. However, even the brightest minds in the Bitcoin community haven't been able to come up with a way to do this with global consensus protocols. (The best so far are layer-2 solutions such as Lightning Network).
Now, as to explain why the analogy sucks. There is only one Bitcoin Blockchain. While there are 23,768 interdependent Starbucks stores. Starbucks practices sharing; some streets have even three or four Starbucks's within viewing distance.
Bitcoin IS analogous Osteria Francescana. There is only Massimo Bottura and his beloved restaurant. - It also is extremely successful. AND. Always sold out.

From my reading, if 51% of the miners choose to always make excessive blocks, then all BU nodes will always accept the excessive sized chain?
Do users who run BU understand this, that they are wholly handing over the block size control to the miners? BU gives the illusion of choice, but in-fact it is nothing more than a miner power-grab.

Most accurate depiction of Satoshi yet.

The Bitcoin community isn't limited by the block size in any meaningful way.
Going through the process to adapt to a real fee-market is critical for the long-term survival of Bitcoin; and will be less painful when Bitcoin is smaller, rather delayed and larger.
When people realise that blockspace is always going to be a scarce resource; and some low importance (as defined by the user willing to pay fee for it) are never going to fit on this 'bus', the entire community will be better of. I realised this back in 2011; however I can see that not everyone has a good understanding of both network theory and economics.

There are many, including I, who don't see the 'congestion' as the pressing problem that the people screaming for the block size increase make it out to be. When Hearn/Gavin wanted the original increase they screamed increase blocksize in 6months or DOOOM!!!!!1 &lt;---  About 18m ago now.
Since then the wallet software that makes stupid low Tx Fees has now been fixed, the network works fine. So yes, the 'congestion' issue has, for all account (other than broken wallet software needing fixing), has been a complete non-issue.
Oh yes, and those who transfer less than $6, and complain that the have more fees than MasterCard.  (Those who send more than $6, on average have less fees than MasterCard, if including the merchant fees that are always passed on to the buyer, somehow).

This is no 'equilibrium price', well at least in common economics. What you have is 'demand curve', with increased demand, the part of the demand curve that fits within the 1mb window becomes a smaller % of the entire curve.
Meaning, for every priority level (ie. economy, business, first, etc), will require a higher payment.

What bias dose have exactly?
The reddit user might have very strong supportive evidence to support the such claim. However without presenting it; the user just looks idiotic.
Or sorry, was your reply incorrectly linked to the wrong post, maybe it was you were responding to?

"bitcoincore user unaffected"

Correct; however you are being disingenuous. The most economically relevant selection of the '10Mb' of transactions will pass through the 1Mb window.
Meaning that the whales, and the deep pockets will keep on using Bitcoin without issue: having little negative effect on the price.
(The Bitcoin price is mostly based upon hodlers, who, but their very nature, make large and infrequent transactions).

It could be because scaling is an engineering hard problem; and just swapping a 1 for a 2 would be dumb.
(You can swap a 1 for a 2, and maybe a 2 for a 4), however each time you erode the engineering safety margin, that good engineers like to keep large.
In structural engineering the common safety factors are 4 to 7x.  That means that the bridge that you drive over is 4-7 times stronger than it EVER needs to be. (if no errors were made in it's design and building).

Regularly rotating out reddit accounts is prudent; just like rotating out old private keys. ;)
Bitcoin's core properties are betrayed if it is made into a popular payment network; (at layer 1). The fact is that we only have one bus, and making a bus 100m long will severely restrain what roads it can safely travel on. (While having only a moderate, linear, capacity increase).
So, if this is that case (as I believe it is), then the question is "what is the best way to allocate the limited bus seats". - Somebody is going to miss out either-way: so lets auction off the space.
The good-saving-grace is that that (layer 2) solutions really, and completely, solve the "Payment Network" question. - Something that layer 1 Bitcoin would never be good at, and shouldn't be shoehorned into becoming.

no, it means that the users who are willing to pay for their transactions will outbid the users that are unwilling to pay for their transactions.
The Bitcoin network and everyone will be just fine, except for the person wanting to send 3 cents in a joke transaction, who will choose not to pay the transaction fee (and elect not to send their joke transaction at all).
