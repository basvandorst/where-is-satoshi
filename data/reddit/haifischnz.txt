"Told you so"

lotsa very angry people here.  I get it...Terrible run.
I'm very glad i went for gold and silver.  I drive the Porsche.  You don't.
@_date: 2019-11-29 13:15:22
lol yep
Why are these people disliking me?
Is BTC backed by anything?  Oh yeah, it isn't.  I'm just not a part of your stupid cargo cult.

2019.10.22 =7300
2019.11.21=7500 this looks like a neck breaker
PS...Just looking at the live chart on Binance @ 7600.  That chart looks UGLY when the bottom falls out on that 200 buck spread, watch out below.  There's nothing to prop it up, there's no volume.

I'll see you when it hits 1500 clown

Doesn't surprise me
@_date: 2019-11-09 12:49:00
lol @ Peter Schiff...he's right there ready to pounce on this thing alright.
Talks crap about it all day...one of its bigger detractors...but he's right there...lurking.

Maybe you should be a responsible son and inform her that BTC is backed by nothing - I really don't give a flying fuck about dislikes.
Gold and Silver for your mum.

@_date: 2019-11-29 12:45:02

@_date: 2019-11-29 12:15:41
Your mum would really like me too ;)
I mean that in a very respectful way.
@_date: 2019-11-25 09:05:14
Next stop is about 3...then 1...then...  Poof
@_date: 2018-06-18 08:10:54
I'll buy your coin when it hits 1300
@_date: 2019-10-29 03:04:09
It's called QE.
@_date: 2019-12-05 07:35:55
