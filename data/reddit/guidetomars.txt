Here's Eric Schmidt learning about bitcoin for the first time from Julian Assange. I can't verify the transcript but many find it credible. Definitely interesting - reads like ancient history now.     Much in there besides bitcoin of interest.

My bank teller in Silicon Valley didn't know of bitcoin as of last month.  Palo Alto Apple store employee asked me for an explanation 2 days ago as in "where is it made?"

Worked for Elon Musk: "My proceeds from PayPal were $180M. I put $100M in SpaceX, $70M in Tesla, and $10M in SolarCity. I had to borrow money for rent." 
Not advice. Just saying.

Thank you. I'm only up to the tax section but the way you begin by exploring the world stage on which cryptocurrency is about to enter is really excellent. I see you even address the issue of child support later on. You know something is mainstream when you start addressing that! Grand of you to do this and I thank you.

This is like an epiphany for me. I suddenly realized how the people currently with coins are the type to fund the really dynamic, forward thinking places that need financial help.  Enough already with disease of the month clubs and pharmacy backed Think Pink type campaigns - they con for cash. This is great news. MAPS is awesome, this news is too.

Palo Alto city controls all utilities including trash/recycle, everything comes on one bill.  Fixed price, no shopping around, the only variable is size of recycle container and that makes only small difference.  You're right about salaries being higher here.  Everything is high here, housing is off the charts.

Only $20?  $50 here in Palo Alto. Includes one garbage and one recycling.
