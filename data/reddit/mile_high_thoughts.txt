Scaling Difficulty: 
The difficulty of Minesweeper is directly proportionate to the size of the grid and the number of mines on the map.
The time taken by a miner to discover a new block is directly proportional to the total processing power of the network, also known as hash rate
Unified Ruleset:
Identify every tile that is a mine.
Solve the blocks and add to the chain.
Replay Value:
Every map is different.
Every block is different.

The exchange does not set the price.

This is the best I can do.
If a seller places a bid higher than current price and a buyer buys it, the price goes up.
If a buyer places a bid lower than current price and a seller sells it, the price goes down.

You can't kill the Bitcoin The Bitcoin will live on BCH tried to kill the Bitcoin But they failed, as they were smite to the ground China tried to kill the Bitcoin But they failed, as they were striken down to the ground S2X tried to kill the Bitcoin

I'm sick of it Look at it, walking around splitting into you know what Forkin' the you know who "yeah, but it's so volatile though" Yea I probably got a couple of screws in its core loose But no worse than what's going on in your countries' central bank  Sometimes you want to sell and just let loose, but can't, But it's cool, just don't hump a dead moose Bitcoin is on your lips, Bitcoin is on your lips And if I'm lucky you might just give it a little kiss And that's the message that we deliver to little kids And expect them not to know what a Bitcoin is. Of course they gonna know what mining is, by the time they hit 4th grade, They got the YouTube channel don't they? We ain't nothing but hodlers,
Well some of us panic who sell low and buy high But if we can justify  Then there's no reason that a coin and another coin can't divide. But if you feel like I feel I got the BTC Miners sing with me, digital currency  
I'm B-T-C, yes I'm the real B-T-C All you other B-T-Cs are just copies So won't the real B-T-C,please stand up, Please stand up, Please stand up

So you guys can just lie to get me here? So you can split me here next to BCH. Shit, dogecoin better switch me chairs So I can sit next to LTC and ETH. And hear 'em argue over who going to moon on Coinbase first. Little BCH split from me  "Yeah its probably gonna die, he he he" I should mine some BCH  And show the whole world how to exchange it for BTC Sick of you little forks 
all you do is annoy me So I have been sent here to destroy thee And there's a million coins just like BTC  Who split like me, who just don't give a fuck like me, who moon like me Walk, talk and act like me, it just might be the next best thing, But not quite BTC 
I'm B-T-C, yes I'm the real B-T-C All you other B-T-Cs are just copies So won't the real B-T-C,please stand up, Please stand up, Please stand up 
Its like a head trip to listen to 'Cause Its only giving you, things you joke about with your friends Inside your mining room The only difference is BTC got the balls to moon in front of y'all And it don't gotta be false or sugar coat it at all I just hodl it, and whether you like to admit it (rip) Its just moonshines better than 90 percent of you coins out there Then I wonder how can you kids sell and panic, it's funny 'Cause at the rate I'm going when I'm hodling  I'll be the only person in the nursing home rolling  A Golden wheelchair And I'm just hodling in this whole crypto market of a decentralized nation And every altcoin is just a BTC imitation 
BCH probably workin' at Burger King Spitten on your onion rings Or in the parking lot circling, Screaming I don't give a fuck with its price down and hype ups  So will the real BTC, please stand up And put one of those fingers on each hand up And to be proud to be outta centrality and outta control And one more time, loud as you can, how does it go? 
I'm B-T-C, yes I'm the real B-T-C All you other B-T-Cs are just copies So won't the real B-T-C,please stand up, Please stand up, Please stand up

Here’s my answer:
Before you start day trading crypto currencies make sure you have a solid grasp of basic math. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 04:20:43
No and No.
Bitcoin is digital keys representing value. 
Coinbase is an online exchange where people buy and sell Bitcoin.

"Regulators have failed to protect consumers. 
Regulators have failed to jail bankers. Regulators have failed to stop fraud on epic proportions. 
Since 2008 we have found out:
Gold is rigged.
Markets are rigged.
Mortgages were fraudulent and rigged. 
Entire foreign exchanges mechanisms were rigged.
And so far no one has gone to jail.
The fines that they have charged are less than profits from the fraud.
And THAT is a license to continue crime.
Until regulators start protecting consumers, I don't think they have anything to add to Bitcoin. 
Bitcoin allows us to do consumer protection by putting control in the hands of consumers themselves.
Bitcoin is consumer protection because privacy is consumer protection.
Bitcoin is consumer protection because user control is consumer protection.
Regulators, they are just helping banks avoid competition. 
Therefore, when the press releases are written by the banks you are supposed to be regulating, you should be in jail too."

Fake news does not exist by the mistake of the writer. It is a way to force an alternate perspective on reality on an audience who is too lazy to research facts about reality. The problem most of the time is the hordes of mindless uneducated populace who read and pass on misinformation that only aligns with their agenda. 
Why did people believe JPM when they claim that Bitcoin is a fraud? Why did people believe JPM then purchased Bitcoin after it fell in price? Why is fake news still going around?
Politics. That's why.

Worldwide politics are being played by some of most powerful leaders in the media and governments. The Bitcoin community does not consist of only holders. Most of them are uneducated nitwits with diarrhea of the mouth as you have proven. Yes, I believe China's announcements and JPM's crying caused a dip in Bitcoin's price.

The Lazy Hodler Song
Today I don't feel like buying anything
I just wanna hodl my coins
Don't feel like taking a bank loan
I’d rather dream of moon stones
'Cause today I swear I'm not selling anything
Uh I'm gonna kick my feet up and stare at the fan
Turn the charts off
Throw my coins in my pants
Nobody's gon' tell me I cant, no
I'll be loungin' on the couch just chillin' in my snuggie
Flip to CNBC so I can listen to the FUD-y
'Cause in my castle I'm the hodlin’ man
Yes I hodl it
I hodl it
I hodl it 'cause I can
Today I don't feel like buying anything
I just wanna hodl my coins
Not caring when to buy or when to sell
And central banks you can go to hell
'Cause today I swear I'm not selling anything 
Nothing at all
Ooh hoo ooh hoo
Hoo ooh ooh
Nothing at all
Ooh hoo ooh hoo
Hoo ooh ooh
Tomorrow I'll wake up invest in some ICO
Have some really nice profits; watch my portfolio grow
And I’m gonna scream out this is great
I might mess around and get some Ethereum 
I bet old contracts won’t be so dumb
But sorry you'll just have to wait
Yes I hodl it
I hodl it
I hodl it 'cause I can
Today I don't feel like buying anything
I just wanna hodl my coins
But soon fiat will die in a blood bath
By people using computer math
'Cause today I swear I'm not selling anything
No I ain't gonna sell my share
'Cause I ain't goin' anywhere
No no no no no no no no no oh
I'll just hodl in my birthday suit
And never let my cryptos loose
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Oh, today I don't feel like buying anything 
I just wanna hodl my coins 
Don't feel like forking the blockchain
Even though they never remain
'Cause today I swear I'm not selling anything
Nothing at all
Ooh hoo ooh hoo
Hoo ooh ooh
Nothing at all
Ooh hoo ooh hoo
Hoo ooh ooh
Nothing at all

Bitcoin is not a pyramid scheme. 
In order to profit in a pyramid scheme you must recruit new investors, in which only you profit from your recruitments.  
I could never recruit a new Bitcoin user and still profit. 
The Bitcoin network could still gain value without a new user to its network. 
Pyramid scheme’s only work if new investors are in supply.

Three thirty in the morning 
Not a update insight 
The market lookin' like a ghost town 
On a moonless summer night 
Speculation on the message boards 
There's a storm moving in 
Can smell it headin' in from somewhere 
That it never should have been 
And the Bitcoin grows
And the Bitcoin grows
Every light is burnin' 
In a computer lab across town 
They're workin on an update 
To help transactions get around 
Askin' for miracle 
Hopin' they are right 
Prayin' it's the coding
That gets this done tonight 
And the Bitcoin grows
And the Bitcoin grows
The Bitcoin grows
And the lightnin' strikes 
Another altcoin goes cold 
On a sleepless night 
As the Bitcoin grows on 
Out of control 
Soon financial freedom 
Across the globe
We're waiting for the announcement 
When the update will arrive
The team finishes up
The beast is alive!
Now the crowds notice 
A strange new wind blows 
And the lightnin' flashes in their eyes 
And we know that they know
And the Bitcoin grows 
And the Bitcoin grows 
The Bitcoin grows
And the lightnin' strikes 
Another altcoin goes cold 
On a sleepless night 
As the Bitcoin grows on 
Out of control 
Soon financial freedom 
Across the globe
They all run to the bank 
Where they kept their dreams before 
Awaken by the light
They don't feel secure there no more
Tells the lady at the counter
They won't do this again 
Cause tonight will be the last time 
Fiat will fool them

My opinion is that the full nodes govern the Bitcoin network. 51% of consensus from the nodes is the deciding factor when verifying transactions. I would say it like this:
Money that is governed by game theory.
@_date: 2017-10-26 01:48:37
The private key must remain secret at all times, because revealing it to third parties is equivalent to giving them control over the bitcoins secured by that key. The private key must also be backed up and protected from accidental loss, because if it’s lost it cannot be recovered and the funds secured by it are forever lost, too.
-Andreas Antonopoulos 
@_date: 2017-10-27 03:12:18
Our current system is not the best we’ve got and your perception of the dollar working is wrong. 
You have the choice right now to opt out of a system that is corrupt and into a network where you trust no one but verify everything based on consensus rule. 
The time of trusting third parties to transact and regulate are over. We have created competition to the market and educating the public is the solution. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 01:17:43
However there is something wrong with a currency being controlled, manipulated, and corrupted by central authorities who need to suppress their users in order to keep their position of power. 
The users should benefit for their productivity and contributions to society by choosing how their wealth is managed and regulated.
