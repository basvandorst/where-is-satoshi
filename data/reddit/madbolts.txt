Won't hit $10K again. lmao dumbasses.
@_date: 2018-05-16 14:16:24
Sadly not anymore. Will never see $10k again. We’ll see 5k before we see 9300 again. Nothing is the same now. Federal gvt controls it and won’t allow us to get out of poverty

Who’s begging?
@_date: 2018-05-13 23:04:36
We’d be st 30k plus now if that were true

I'm open to proof that's not provided to us by the very people trying to push an agenda. 
Have YOU ever seen the Earth from far away? The answer is a resounding "FUCK NO YOU HAVEN'T"
NASA = Never A Straight Answer. I've no doubt we're being lied to. I'm just not dumb enough to buy and eat the shit they feed us. Clearly you think it's delicious and for that I'm truly sorry. 
Is the Earth Flat? maybe , I have no way of ever knowing.

What’s magma? Lava? Such an embarrassment 
@_date: 2018-05-03 21:32:58
That stopped in the late 60s 
@_date: 2018-05-05 20:46:06
That's awesome!

Yes, GoX is temporary. 
$50,000? Never lmfao.. not a chance in Hell.
They're not "grey hairs" yeah they're old AF but it's their team that is paid money you and I and the rest of world will never see , with access to things we'll never understand that are in control of something that can't be controlled.
You really think someone named "Satoshi" created Bitcoin? You think they didn't know all about it years before it was launched and weren't *there* the day it did. 
@_date: 2018-05-13 22:22:31
It's reached critical mass. The 3 lettered governments are involved and control some of it, MT. Gox selling off thousand of BTC at a time and waiting until the price increases to just under 10K, sells thousands more.. 
Point is, people and government can control the price. So they are. We'll never see $10K BTC again. It's over.
@_date: 2018-05-16 13:41:54
what's fishy? crypto is dead Mt Gox    and the us government control it now. It's over. 
@_date: 2018-05-06 00:37:55
You can't buy shit with Bitcoin so until then, noooope.
@_date: 2018-05-04 20:13:19
I really wish the Bcash people would just stop pretending, stop being afraid to be Bcash.
@_date: 2018-05-15 18:17:01
Yep. Crypto is over. But these fools with their optimism will soon be parted.
@_date: 2018-05-18 10:51:44
How much? They should have led the LN with this and not all the extra steps it takes to buy a coffee, it's horribly designed and inconvenient but if you make money.. then how much?
@_date: 2018-05-15 16:56:47
what's bitcoin core? is that a fork of Bcash?
I've only heard of Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-05-09 20:15:34
We won't see $10K again. It's over.
@_date: 2018-05-16 14:14:09
Sure block chain tech is amazing and that’s all that’s thriving. No one will become rich off crypto anymore
@_date: 2018-05-21 12:44:28
There won't be anymore bull runs because the US Government has obtained control over \*Most\* Cryptos BTC included. In addition to that, Mt. GoX is dumping 100s of thousands of BTC when the price peaks close to 9.5K \+ killing any chance of of anyone making any money anymore.
Crypto is dead as fuck. Do you think the Government will allow the poor to become wealthy? lmfao. slapdicks. 
Bull run.. BTC won't $10K ever again. 
@_date: 2018-05-18 21:01:40
Easy to say when you’re already wealthy. (In fiat) you want more people to join your cause . 
Lift them out of poverty. Paycheck to paycheck prison. 80/ hour weeks.
Start with me: 1DNpFfd4dqEtsJC5vgjh37NBUymjE4hyes
One by one people helping others will make this happen. 
Otherwise. Crypto dies as it has been all of 2018
