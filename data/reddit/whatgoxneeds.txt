• Provide solution architecture and oversight for in-flight Payments projects

Unless you are doing a lot of volume, the cost of rent alone for a larger 2/way machine is going to kill you.  Keep in mind the pwr/internet/physical security costs.  
 
A good option would be to find a high-traffic educational institution or such if that was your goal.
If you are looking to be a proud owner of a smaller machine like a skyhook, they can be placed/secured on a counter in a public area, perhaps a storefront.. for much less cost, as you can tell the storeowner that it will generate traffic to his/her establishment..   Then promote the hell out of it.

I used /changetip to tip them both, giving them their first bit of crypto to either hodl, hoard, or pay forward.

Assuming that a person is in this for the long term, and that the hashrate stabilizes, most mining calculators will calculate an ROI date that is completely immaterial.  
If the current hashrate stays the same, or within a 20% gain before stabilizing, most miners with 1st Gen technology, will be turning off..       
Anybody in for the longterm will want the most efficent gear available..   Purchase it, and leave it on for the long term...    It can always double as a space-heater..

With bitcoin's relatively small market cap, It's expected that to fight us best, the 'establishment' would drive the price down into the crapper.. disillusioning the miners, industry newcomers, and anybody who saw 'potential' in this technology... because other than that, the base technology is unstoppable. 
With the price plummeting, I can't help but think we've entered the FIGHT stage:
First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, THEN THEY FIGHT YOU, then you win.

Hey, thanks for stepping up... I've had experience with several Canadian exchanges.. Both currently existing and long gone.. Looking forward to giving your a look as well.  Where is Cancoin based, what makes you different?  What are your deposit and trading fees, funding options, etc?
(I could always look it up, but why not share here?)
(Currently using QuadrigaCX, Kraken, and local options)
Edit:  I see it's kind of like a merger between Mycellium marketplace and LocalBitcoins..  A buy/sell option across Canada peer-to-peer, unlike an exchange for trading or larger buys..    Great option for anyone without a BitcoinATM nearby or doesn't like exchange AML/KYC)

-- it's nice to see that many column-inches dedicated to bitcoin, and targeting the right market..    Eventually they'll realize that regardless of other private blockchains, Bitcoin will become the 'standard'.. and you need some to play the game.
 
Mp3 came long before ogg, flac, and ITunes.. it's technically inferior, but the average person equates digital music with MP3  synonymously as 'Geletin' is Jello, 'disposable diapers' are pampers, 'tissue paper' is 'Kleenex'..  
Bitcoin has become the standard the average 'Joe' will use for transactions and investment... It will hold value.
Transaction times, block sizes and civil war won't matter when it comes to investments and holding..  In fact, the more that industry adopts their fancy private blockchains and promotes them in the media "Hey, Look at us!", the more the average person will jump on the bitcoin bandwagon.
I remember teaching email to one of my employers and setting it up...   having to check it every day and print them out on paper so they could 'do email'.. read them, write a reply, and have someone type it out to send...       Dinosaurs will always need youth to help them take advantage of new technology --    So work on your blockchain skills, build your knowledge of how things work, and buy a few bitcoin... eventually someone will want to hire you for it.... Perhaps the people who read this article.
tl/dr. - Leverage your knowledge.. learn bitcoin, learn distributed blockchain ledgers, buy bitcoin..   Get a kick ass job working for some believer with lots to invest...  and get paid in Bitcoin...    Build your future.

Cheapest is an exchange.  QuadrigaCX is one of Canada's best for large ($50 -- $50k) amounts... But don't be shy about proving who you are with ID.
For a few hundred dollars worth, you can either use a bitcoin ATM, or localbitcoins.
If you have Mycellium (Android wallet), you can use the buy/sell feature to locate somebody near you, and meetup in person.
Others will hopefully answer here with more specifics..  
QuadrigaCX will end up costing you about 2% over spot by the time you are done.   
Other options will cost 3-7% more depending, but are more anonymous.    
Depends why you want bitcoin, really...  For drugs and gambling, or for trading and speculation, for example.
If you post your addrrzs, people may send you $1 or so, so that you can learn how it works before jumping in with both feet.

To be honest, although grass-roots adoption is great, if they don't have somewhere to use it, and a reason to use it, then it is a lost cause.
 
Case in point:  If a local bitcoin seller hung out at starbucks and offered to fill people's gift cards for 10% off, the average consumer won't care, as a $25 fill would only save them $2.50..   ie: Buy 10 get one free type savings.     
20% - the fold app.. will definitely get their attention... you donate your time for free in education, but it might stick if they have a source of bitcoins.. which kind of nullifys the entire idea.
However:   Talking to a few managers in the Starbucks down in the city core, and finding out that they Cater to local office towers... then you have a business case.     Those clients buy larger quantities, and the savings matter to the one person who has to orchestrate it for the office...  savings enough they may buy/use bitcoin.

Your welcome!  -- For all the words I hear about needing to get bitcoins adoption, I find it pretty embarrassing that there are only a few thousand full nodes world wide, and most are out of date... And those running them get very little support..
Td;lr - Miners wouldn't mine without $ as incentive...but running a Node at your own cost is truly supporting bitcoin ecosysyem... They should stand up and take a bow.

...also running a full node here...  of 23 connections, only 4 of mine are running Satoshi:0.11.0
  --  I'd happily tip nodes running the latest build if there way only a way...  
 
  Edit:   Pointed a browser at each connected IP, and discovered  ....       I don't know who you are, but i've sent a thanks..  You Rock!
  
  Edit2:  Other 0.11.0 nodes are 85.10.202.167, 70.75.54.6, and 68.39.91.115.    If you PM me proof, i'll send you bits as well..    
  Any others out there?

4) - Hashrate drops substantially..  All community miners drop out due to expenses, and larger corporate mines duke it out for the remaining profit. --  They refuse to dump any longer, so 1) Price doubles and users begin to hoard, awaiting 'mass adoption'..   Silicon Valley bankers get rich on IPOs, and we all wonder what happened...

Some groundwork has been laid already...  I think there are two or three completely different demographics to be targeting though...  
1) Students, and Adults under 35ish --  They understand technology, grew up with Google, MP3 and digital photography..   To them, it's a natural fit... they are not as conservative as business or older generations, and have the disposible income.    Target items would be gurilla marketing, bumper sticks and such...  Areas would be places of education, malls etc..  Clubs could furnish speakers for meetups to the other demographics.
 
2) Adults in Business &amp;/or Corporate Settings..  Serious money and potential to help them in business and travel situations.    To get their attention, it has to be all about saving them money and adding convenience.     Corporate gas cards, business travel, anything billed ongoing to a visa card in large dollars..    They need a 30 second pitch that says "I can save you serious business costs by channeling your costs over this direction...".     It means more than hand holding...   It means partnering with resource partners and bitpay to streamline their needs, doing all the legwork to make it seamless as well ..    The business just need to know results... The end result is they talk to other people.  "This bitcoin thing.. is saving us money.. not sure how, but it is... call these guys.."
3) Merchants and vendors -  Business adoption...     This third group is where you would fit 'Backpage' clients, as well as small businesses.     Small business needs an edge to survive over the Walmarts of the world.    They need places that they can buy supplies with the BTC they receive, and somehow at a discount... this will drive them to use and adopt..  and it's our job as a community to spend our BTC with them as loyal customers, even if it means costing a bit more to us...   
 
Examples here would vary depending on community, but it becomes a grass roots thing.   Can that coffee shop buy supplies or advertising in BTC, and can you frequent that coffee shop often?     Can you insert BTC into the economy on both sides.. for example --  The University book store that accepts BTC from the students to buy books?    - The students use it, the university book store accepts it, and although a closed economy..its big enough to drive adoption.
There are lots of ways that BTC can benefit organizations, but not without us helping drive it.

Personally, i'm running the latest bitcoin node 0.11.0.
I find connected client running an open port 80, and then donate.    For example, If I find port 8333 is open, i hit up port 80...   Sometimes I see stuff like this:   or this 
I'm currently rewarding any 0.11.0 nodes i can identify.
 Just sayin...  Not everyone's a 'l33t h4x0rz' ... some just donate :)

Hi.  I'm a recent transplant from Vancouver, and I definitely agree that the city if Calgary is sleeping. :)
It takes a lot of time and energy to self-promote bitcoins, and Calgarians seem sceptical.. As in, why are you telling  me this, what's in it for me?
Suggestion &amp; Support:  I am quite tech savvy, with lots of experience in the AV and Digital signage industries.... It might help to take a different approach here than in Vancouver..
I have a few things in mind, and I'll run them past Bitnational when I'm downtown next... They'd take some resources ($) and time, but would boost exposure and business at the same time.

I received a panic call from a "friend of a friend" who bought bitcoin and litecoin during the $1000 high, and had them on VoS..    He found out they were shutting down but didn't know how to create a wallet.
Long story short, I 'rescued' his bitcoin to a new address in exchange for a bottle of decent rum..   As there was an error withdrawing the LTC, Multiple emails to VoS regarding the Litecoin sent to VoS, and Ignored.
Between 'We are shutting down' and the '25% charges', He lost about 700 LTC, simply because we couldn't withdraw, and got no responses from our attempts.   It could be worse, so he licked his wounds and walked away.

A friend was interested in adding bitcoin to a new web business he is setting up, but unsure of anything else...  I sen him $5, walked him through a wallet and chatted for an hour...  Now he's sold, and finding an ATM to throw in $50 to play with... As an avid Starbucks visitor, I clinched his enthusiasm with "20% more coffee with bitcoin!"

The OP should be aware the guy might be planning a Metasploit against any XP systems he can find..   if port 2869 is avail/open, then it may indicate a Metasploit vulnerability.
-- Thats hoping for a vulnerable XP system running a bitcoin daemon that he can grab a 'wallet.dat' file from..   Older systems might also indicate a no-so-savvy user, so probably an unencrypted wallet.dat at that.

For those that remember the 'financial debt ceiling' in america, they have to either vote to increase it (republicans AND democrats all agreeing) and get the president to sign-off,  or simply default on debts and be unable to pay their own government employees..   A few years ago they kicked the can again up to about March 2017.. but shit's happened since then, and the debt problems has gotten a whole lot worse. 
 
tl;dr -   Shit will get real in March 2017, because America's gov't max'ed out their 'credit limit' again, and gets to chose between shutting down government to save $, or apply for more credit cards!

Vancouver has a great Bitcoin scene..
I would suggest you head to Bitnational's offices in the Waves coffee shop on Howe Street, downtown Vancouver to exchange any serious quantity.
While you're in Vancouver, there a million must-see things, and every kind of food imaginable... But if you like sushi, I can recommend Shabusan, Burrard Street near Robson...  Robson Street, Davie Street, and Commercial Drive are also all good spots to check out..

I'll second sumwhatkiller..    Hands-down, QuadrigaCx is responsive and the exchange is solid.    KYC may suck, but unlike the US, they're not asking for blood and stool samples.. The KYC need is something to satisfy the fiat deposit/withdrawal banking relationships. 
 
Oh.. and they keep their cash in Canadian accounts, protected by the FDIC...   
Oh.. and when Vogogo disappears, stranding coinbase peeps,  Quadriga will still be there..  They accept interac e-transfers, and many other fiat options.
They also have a nice physical presence.

Buy now.. Soon because anyone remotely stuck in ETH  has a quick way to swap into BTC to preserve their $ while the DAO issue waits for a 'Resolution"..    BTC is a safehaven for other cryptos even without the halfing..  There is a lot of ETH out there that might be worth ZERO in two weeks.. (If not zero, a huge drop in reclaimable value.. It will make a 10% drop look like a regular day in BTC land...suicide hotline and all ;)
