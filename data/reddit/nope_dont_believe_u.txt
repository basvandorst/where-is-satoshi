Adam appears earnest and reasonable. There is a *much* larger issue here though IMHO. Please see my comment here as it would be too much for me to re-type:

I hope you appreciate how immature and ridiculous almost everyone at your company with the exception of looks in this debate. Petty little snide people desperately clinging to ownership of bitcoin by relying on condescension and sly underhanded coercion. That's the perception. **and are taking on a group of technical bullies in broad daylight.** They don't need to for personal reasons. I'm sure they don't enjoy this big dramatic mess but they believe bitcoin can and should scale.
There is also a more significant meta-debate at play. Who controls bitcoin? **Why should Blockstream have veto power of bitcoin?** It isn't healthy. All of this talk of "consensus" is nauseating. It's a tool for Blockstream to maintain control. I'm still waiting for anyone to define what the fuck they mean when they play this consensus card. The game is rigged. You might fool some but you don't fool us all. You don't fool the VCs funding bitcoin businesses. You don't fool the wallet developers. You don't fool the API providers. You are completely obvious. And now you are rightfully frightened that maybe your little group's project will be ripped away from you: rightly fucking so. You guys didn't invent bitcoin. You have worked on it because you enjoy it but that doesn't give you any right over me or anyone else in the system. YOU DO NOT CONTROL US. WE OWE YOU NOTHING.
All of this aside, affiliation with this toxic guy is a massively big political mistake for your company. He is a deranged lunatic. This isn't some controversial opinion. Look at his god damned reddit history for fuck's sake. His views on humanity are abysmal. It shows how disturbed he is and paints a clear picture for why he enjoys telling people how to use bitcoin and what they ought to do.
You got your clique funded but you didn't really fully consider the public perception of this action because let's face it when it comes to bitcoin you don't value other people's opinions at all. The "consensus" of your clique is all that matters to you and that is not real consensus. You reap what you sow.
