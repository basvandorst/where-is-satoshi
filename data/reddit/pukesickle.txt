The future of currency is a stable one that doesn't have speculators hoping for volatility

Pump and dump baby.

I think you are seeing the speculators take profits, and then other people see the price drop and try to cash out while they can. This is typical stock behavior, just with very high volatility.

That is terrifying to me as an investor. As a trader, maybe not.

If bitcoin is ruled by traders, this volatility will be the norm.

Warren Buffet bought stocks this way.

I completely agree.

Emotional trading makes bad choices.

I agree. Headline risk from governments will probably be around for a while, including statements from the US. Traders may jump out each time, and this could be a recurring event. Hopefully not.

When I see the 'to the moon' comments I think that this volatility will never calm down.  Traders and speculators cause this, investors don't.

Absolutely. As long as a company's fundamentals were good, he would buy depressed stocks like they were going out of style. He bought Bank of America stock at 7 dollars when everyone else hated it, but he knew it had underlying value beyond the crappy headlines that were beating it down. Now it's at 15 and change.

Its interesting to see how investing and trading get so emotional, leading to more volatility, leading to more emotion, etc.

You have to ask yourself why you picked that entry point, and where you expect it to go? Are you trading or holding for the long term?
If you think that's gonna go up from here, don't panic, but be careful about catching a falling knife. There isn't a ton of support below the current levels.
