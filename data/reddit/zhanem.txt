You literally made that argument before.  “You’ve only been a redditor for 2 weeks so you can’t be an expert at crypto”, “I was educated by a formal institution so I’m right”  Sound familiar? Also argument by authority. Was just mocking you but now can see you were too stupid to see even that.  Hypocrite.  Also what happened to being done with me? xD

LOL you are so persistent at being stupid.  When did I say I was self educated?  But even if I was you are just plain wrong.  Look at the history of BTC.  Learn behavioral economics.  PM me and I’d be happy to direct you to a few resources.  Also nice job being “done” with me.  Primitive monkey brain lmaooo.

Whales.  You can’t really explain a 500$ jump in price without good news about bitcoin.

Sure bud you argued back in the last one btw.  Can’t even keep consistent.  My formal institution’s probably better too lmao, not that it matters, but shouldn’t I be the one mocking you?  Your argument is perfectly representative of people who buy BTC with no understanding of markets.

You’re wrong and this isn’t even debatable, this is pretty basic market theory.  It jumped $700 in less than a day.  A couple people bought a lot, increasing volume.  An increase in volume drives price up because it creates an illusion of demand.  And people see it going up, buy it, so that’ll drive the price up even more, then the whales sell it for a profit.  I’m all for riding waves (I am) but don’t be mistaken that this is regular growth, especially the jump today.

When one person demands it with the sole intention to sell high and let price fall it’s called manipulation because no one will rebuy what he sold LOL.  Also what happened to being done with me? :P  I’m really sorry you weren’t privileged enough to educate yourself but don’t take it out on me buddy.

Make a new account every year hehe.  But I also didn’t know that the longer you were a redditor the more knowledge you have in crypto, what an insanely stupid argument.  I’ll also take your statement to say that you do not in fact have a college degree.  But hey, who needs college when you’re a redditor LOLOL.  Fuck outta here with your stupid ass.  The point is your original post is a bad look for bitcoin and your lack of understanding is really apparent in your comments.

So all those people decided to buy at the EXACT same time on the EXACT same day.  Look at the graph bud.  It’s a statistic impossibility.   A market is a market, currency or stock - you described it yourself.  You’re actually too uneducated to be discussing with LOL.  I’m not about to be your intro college prof.  Because I actually really doubt you went to college.  And hey I’m all for the increase of BTC so really we’re on the same side.  The difference is I understand the market and you don’t.

Healthy growth of $700 in price comes slowly day by day for like a month.  This isn't my "theory", anyone with a degree in economics (Or take intro econ) would be able to tell you this much.  The illusion of demand is created because one person is buying a large supply with the intention to manipulate the price.  And as you said - its like the past, BTC has always been manipulated in the past.  In fact MOST if not ALL emerging markets go through manipulation.  The rise to 20k was because of manipulation - plain and simple.  And if the only appeal of BTC is it's collectible, then fine your argument somewhat makes sense -  though I also have a gripe with this.  But I just have a general problem with your original post.  It's like a loser won the lottery and said "I wonder where all those people who said I'd be a failure are now?".  No one yet knows the viability of BTC, its a risky investment, and you drew a parallel to Supreme - I hope theres more viability than that.  Mind you my cost average for BTC is $1300 and have been a long term HODLer so it's not like I'm hating on the rise of BTC.  But the statement just comes off as stupid which I feel is a bad look for this subreddit.

This is pure market manipulation tho.
