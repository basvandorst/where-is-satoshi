Have made a diary note for May 2017 to check see how Preston's prediction turns out. In the meantime, looking for a smart betting contract to take a wager he's right.

The position throughout the EU is largely the same: if you are registered for VAT and you sell BTC then you must account for VAT on BTC sales. Similarly, if you purchase BTC from a VAT-registered seller then you can reclaim the VAT paid. The net effect is to hand over to your government the difference between VAT on sales and VAT on purchases (EUR 0.95 in your example).
There is no real price implication for VAT-registered businesses doing business with other VAT-registered businesses and for non-registered businesses and private individuals transacting BTC with one another. The **real** issue is the difference in price of BTC between VAT-registered businesses and those who are not registered for VAT. 
Until there are changes in EU law (which effectively excludes cryptocurrencies from being considered *legal tender*), BTC's position in EU member states will remain anomalous, confused and costly.

Sadly, CNBC's headline:


is plain wrong. Rather the opposite: Germany does **not** recognise Bitcoin as legal tender. The German Finance Ministry clarified Bitcoin's status as being *Rechnungseinheiten* or *units of account*, excellently described by Adrianne Jeffries in her recent [The Verge article]( as:


What I really like is the German financial regulator's (BaFin) grouping of Bitcoin in the same category as the IMF's Special Drawing Rights. Sweet! 
The German Finance Ministry's response to Schäffler's official enquiry does much to elevate Bitcoin's respectability index but there is a very long way to go yet.

If you are a VAT-registered business in the EU, the sale of Bitcoin is taxed **as well as** the goods and services purchased with those Bitcoin. As it stands at present, BTC is not legal tender or *money* (in the legal sense) and so transactions in BTC are considered barter. This results in both commodities being taxable.
From an income/capital gains tax perspective, each EU member state has its own rules for determining when a profit (or loss) on the sale of BTC occurs but, from my research, all member states expect their share of profits derived from your realised sales of BTC (albeit with exemptions and reductions, in some cases, for long-term holdings).

So, basically, a good news / bad news story! 
Good news: 'We will never be able to de-anonymize all Tor users all the time'.
Bad news:  '... with manual analysis we can de-anonymize a very small fraction of Tor users'.

Tradehill has moved its banking to the Internet Archive Federal Credit Union [
 
UK-based Bitcoin businesses find it virtually impossible to obtain bank accounts without going offshore. Could credit unions hold the answer? Anyone working on this or interested in pursuing the idea further?
