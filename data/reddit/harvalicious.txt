i'm sorry i know i could probably find this out on my own but can you purchase with a debit card?  Is it safe?

3root.  your response made me wonder, if this "currency" is so susceptible to theft, how will it ever be commonly used? 
@_date: 2013-11-19 05:30:46
yes.  exactly.  as i responded to someone else...
i understand the basics of supply and demand but when i'm looking at the live ticker and I see it go up and down what is that based on?? if i buy one from a friend does that make it go up, or does it have to be from a miner? what happens when a new coin comes into circulation?

really?  i don't know why don't you ask 28,000,000 japanese.  i suppose maybe Fumiko Chiyo got to buy himself a nice new off road mountain bike and go for a ride before he died two years later from a boating accident.  Furthermore, what are the 'tangible' benefits of bitcoins?  
I appreciate what you're trying to do here socrates but i need more.

From 1989 to 2003, the Japanese economy was suffering from a long deflationary period. On June 2003, over a 15 month period, the Japanese central bank intervened in the YEN/USD currency markets by creating over 35 trillion Yen of currency ("printing" money). This currency was then used to buy 320 billion U.S. dollars, which were in turn invested into U.S. treasuries. This increased the supply of yen, weakening the yen against the dollar, improving exports and lifting Japan out of a deflationary period. At the same time, the U.S. was lifted out of the 2001-2003 recession with the ability to keep interest rates low, despite growing trade and government deficits.

Thanks for the tips!  Will do.  50 years from now when I've  good and forgotten them a lucky reddit user will find my hidden safe.   Reddit drama will ensue, the safe will be opened and a new multimillionaire will be born.
