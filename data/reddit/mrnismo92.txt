I didn't mention "start up". I said "tech stocks".
Also, I'd argue that Boeing is 10x more innovative than Tesla.

Before you blast Warren for not investing in tech stocks...
Berkshire Hathaway owns 6.3% of IBM, which was initially purchased in 2011 (so not too long ago).

Can somebody explain to me the benefits of having a btc ATM? Thanks!
@_date: 2014-02-27 19:13:04
Thanks! Two more Qs:
Do you receive some sort of receipt with a QR code?
Can you turn in your bitcoins for cash @ the ATM?

Ha, you think this is crazy--check out the pre-FOMC  statement trading action on the SPY and TLT!

I'm a bit confused about this line--what do you mean by "all across"?
Other than that, I agree with pretty much everything you said!
I've been telling people that the form-factor for payments via BTC needs to be MUCH more easier/secure to use than credit-cards/cash for BTC to gain popularity @ brick&amp;mortars.

Well...this was in 1998 so I don't blame him.
The odds of you improperly valuing an internet company @ the time was pretty damn high.
Yes, he's old and doesn't understand the long-term value of some internet services, but internet companies were a completely different breed before 2000.

Awesome! Thanks for the thorough answer.

BUT! I should add, heightened activity from the dev community will eventually make it easier for developers across the board (with varying skills) to embed BTC payments in their applications.
Bravo to those contributing.

Completely agree with you.
However, for it to gain traction--payments gateways/processors need to utilize an easier form factor for payments and this goes all the way from syscalls -&gt; consumer interface.
But yeah, I was surprised to see how easy it was to process payments!

Apples to oranges.
PayPal is way closer to market saturation than BTC.

Way too many screens for BTC price.
You need to have some orderbooks or LevelIIs for a major currency pair EURUSD (or whatever currency you're trading BTC against) to compare your BTC trades to.
Regardless, happy trading!
