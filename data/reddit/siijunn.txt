I still don't understand all the hate towards Coinbase. Price Crash? If you're getting into this and you don't know that can happen, that is your fault. Sorry.
It feels like Coinbase is getting blamed for people being irresponsible. Not their fault (in fact, they actively encourage security and remind of the volatility).

Ha, same here bro. Not so much about the losing but the hiding.

As far as I’m concerned, most of the stuff I’ve read from analyst (from months ago) was 10k by December, and then double that by March. Seem to be doing fine

I don't think so. There was so much to do, but if it did it was an easy scan. 
It asked me to set up a "pin" with my phone number and a pin number. Then it asked how much I wanted to take out / sell. Then it calculated the exact amount (fees included) to send, and a QR code to send. It then sent me a text with a confirmation number. Then it gave me a receipt with ANOTHER number to enter after the blockchain was updated. Waited approx 10, hit the withdrawal button, and entered the number. 
FYI, it was a rockitcoin ATM. The cashier asked me what I was doing, because ever since it was installed no one had used it. Felt pretty cool.

Can someone give me a little information on the difference between coinbase / gdax? If I can buy from gdax... what the heck do I need coinbase for ?

Perfect answer. Thank you!

I remember this! 
I remember thinking about doing it, but not wanting to go through the hassle of setting up a wallet, etc. Thinking “i have no idea how to even cash it in...”

Thanks- yeah I've figured that one out ;)

There are actually quite a few bit coin ATMs here. Another one that I use is at the downtown Merchandise Mart. Lots in the burbs too!
