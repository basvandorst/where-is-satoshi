They are assisting in exploring thought further. Of course they are legitimate concerns.

I am getting a clearer picture of your point here and appreciate the response. Diving a little deeper I have some follow-up questions, playing devil's advocate here.
What do you say to the potential of companies that use price gouging until a competitor arises and then utilize price discrimination in the area near that just-starting, small scale competitor? Is it the responsibility of a consumer to not buy from that company even though the prices are lower for a same or similar product? Or is that not necessary? Is the power of the company justified here even though they are intentionally trying to force an anti-competitive market?
Touching on your patent point, don't you think that when removing the patent protection you will see less progress in those markets? If a product can be directly copied what is the incentive for an inventor to create, produce, and sell that product? Profits would be short lived and it would cost more initially for the person with the original idea. Cost wouldn't be replenished unless no one decided to replicate the product, which if it is a good, marketable idea, is unlikely.
Doesn't the idea of a free market require the assumption that corporations are inherently good and will not manipulate the consumers or the market itself?

You peeked my interest with such an rarely seen, at least on my end, point of view. How would your view address things like monopolies that spring up in a free-market?

I was using it more as questions to further explore the thought, delve deeper into the argument / debate. I wasn't taking a position on either side, but merely 'poking' at the ideas presented. Maybe devil's advocate isn't the write phrase there, but I figured that would best represent the tone of my questions.
