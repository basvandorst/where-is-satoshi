I would as well but it's a little too sketchy for me getting something shipped to my house. So. Same. 
@_date: 2018-05-07 09:00:29
You started by saying "good news" but then continued to say terrible news. LOLLLL 
@_date: 2018-03-14 17:49:19
I'm confused, weren't we at these same prices just a few days ago?
@_date: 2018-03-09 05:19:20
He isn't really wrong... Trying to time the bottom was what lost me a lot of money because I never guessed correctly. Just go in when you feel comfortable.
@_date: 2018-03-07 20:30:48
Not sure where you are quoting me saying I was knowledgeable? You are calling me out for something that even you do not know. Am I right about my 5.5K support? Maybe? Am I wrong? Maybe. You know no more than I. So quit the bullshit, my point still stands, this won't happen in one fucking day. 
@_date: 2018-03-07 19:22:38
Not as extreme as Mt. Gox as of now but it isn't rubbish, this is going to really disrupt the market even more for a bit. 
@_date: 2018-03-15 02:24:45
Well. Fuck. My apologies. 
@_date: 2018-03-10 22:40:42
Bro. I'll make him stop spamming shit if it means I get some coins. Lol. 
Nate, tell me, where do I go to beat your ass?
@_date: 2018-03-09 06:13:59
We won't go below 8K. You can hold me to that.
@_date: 2018-03-11 18:42:19
Just came back to say, as of yet, we still have not gone below 8K. :)
@_date: 2018-03-12 20:28:57
Maybe. They seemed to help us out lately. We will see. 
@_date: 2018-03-09 02:03:48
I am well aware when I SHOULD have gotten out. But here I am....
@_date: 2018-03-08 02:15:17
Is anyone invested happy with it going down? Why would they be?
@_date: 2018-03-09 06:38:38
They aren't being sold yet.
@_date: 2018-03-11 18:42:51
It's been over 2 days days, still not below 8K.
@_date: 2018-03-07 19:59:42
Really? So you are saying it is more likely to drop %59 to 4K than rise 52% to 15K?
@_date: 2018-03-05 04:06:24
Nope. Got burned last week thinking it would dip. Not again I said. Not again.
@_date: 2018-03-08 23:43:58
Better than down I suppose. LOL
@_date: 2018-03-07 23:15:52
Is this due to Binance resuming withdraws again?
@_date: 2018-03-09 20:45:49
I'm probably wrong, like always but I want it on record if I'm right....
We will drop down to around $8,200 on tomorrows candle, which starts in about 3 hours. Then we will shoot back up and be green for the day. That will be the end of this dip and we will continue upward to 11K over the next week.
@_date: 2018-03-10 22:13:12
Not you again.... Mt. Gox can't sell his stuff at the moment. These sell offs are not him.
@_date: 2018-03-10 23:44:47
I am talking about the daily chart. I was wrong though, unless we go up $500 in 15 minutes the candle isn't flipping green. Hopefully tomorrow I guess. 
@_date: 2018-03-10 05:18:36
Truth! Just makes sure you only invest what you can absolutely afford is what I tell people. Otherwise. Do you!
@_date: 2018-03-08 04:03:59
Kill me now and don't activate quantum immortality.
@_date: 2018-03-08 17:08:17
Not that it means anything but dump ended at 9:15PST yesterday. So hopefully same thing happens today.
@_date: 2018-03-08 17:40:04
I agree 1000%. Had I done that. Well, I would be a very happy man. LOL
@_date: 2018-03-08 16:56:07
I wish I had seen this when I first started in Crypto. I made a lot of money and NEVER took profits because someone told me to "keep it in there to make more". Now I'm super depressed because I'm way down on my investment and don't see myself ever getting it back. 
@_date: 2018-03-07 17:19:51
Well, I would tread lightly on buying in right now since the drop is due to a hack. 
@_date: 2018-03-12 19:42:15
Your dice let me down. :(
@_date: 2018-03-07 19:49:00
Such nonsense? LOL. The support wall at 5.5K was giant when we hit 6K. I wouldn't say it is nonsense. Give or take $500 maybe but it won't go below that in one day unless something much more drastic happens than this.
@_date: 2018-03-09 02:56:45
I have lost 5K starting today. :(
@_date: 2018-03-07 19:25:16
Okay, that is just a ridiculous statement. This is going to drop further but it won't go down to 4K in one day. Even if it started to the support at 5.5K is too strong. 
@_date: 2018-03-06 22:54:13
No one can tell you. I would wait about an hour to see what happens. Take what I say with a grain of salt though. 
@_date: 2018-03-09 06:45:25
He has to be joking. No way could his luck be THAT bad. LOL.
@_date: 2018-03-09 06:51:26
LOL. Jesus. If you bought at 20K what would even be the point of selling at 6K? Already lost that much.
@_date: 2018-03-08 17:48:45
A day of silence for those that bought at ATHs. RIP.
@_date: 2018-02-26 06:45:55
As I said. The night was still young. Down she goes.
@_date: 2018-03-08 17:34:10
As of now, the dump seemed to stop at 9:18PST. Crossing fingers we can get a little bit of relief.
@_date: 2018-03-09 17:53:06
If you are a bear and you bring up a valid argument, I will %100 listen to you. I am in between on where I feel the markets going to go. However, if you just throw random numbers out without any real explanation, you can piss the fuck off.
@_date: 2018-03-07 20:59:30
*yawn* Haven't heard that 50 times before....
@_date: 2018-03-14 18:00:42
Gotcha. Thanks you!
@_date: 2018-03-09 18:19:43
I agree, I would be happy with some regulation. But everyone here wants Lambos overnight and that isn't as likely with regulation.
@_date: 2018-03-10 20:58:12
The chance of this flipping to a green candle today is pretty high. Bitcoin has only had this many red candles in a row 1 time in the past 6+ months and that was coming off of the ATH. 
@_date: 2018-03-11 18:46:53
Seems so far I was right, it just took 1 day longer for it to happen. :)
@_date: 2018-03-09 00:00:54
I think he is worried it MAY not go up again in the near future so he doesn't want to play risk at this point incase it tanks and doesn't recover. 
@_date: 2018-03-07 17:45:13
I wouldn't fall for this bounce either. I could be wrong but I think it is going to continue down for a few days. 
@_date: 2018-03-26 14:26:17
Y'all think this is bad? Come join us ETHers, we're getting executed. LOL. 
@_date: 2018-03-09 02:06:11
Yeah, I have looked at the daily and 4 red candles in a row has happened very few times in the past 6 months. So, I think this dip will flip and the candle will turn green today.
@_date: 2018-03-10 21:14:25
Fairly certain people have been warning of this same thing for years. You telling us or not won't be the deciding factor if we stay in or pull out. LOL. So, please, do yourself a favor and do something more productive with your time. 
@_date: 2018-03-07 20:57:31
That is what I am thinking. It will either be a hard dip or a quick spike back to where it came from. It won't hold here for more than another hour or two. 
@_date: 2018-03-14 04:09:38
About to really do a hard long dip here. :(
@_date: 2018-03-08 18:44:09
It's okay, just hold, don't sell when it goes through. We will get back and you will stay on top. Don't sweat it.
@_date: 2018-03-08 17:03:03
Dump happened at the exact same time yesterday.....
@_date: 2018-02-28 15:20:57
Honestly, some people in crypto are ridiculous. Barely goes down and they claim it's crashing. Five minutes later it barely goes up and they claim we will see 20k the next day....
@_date: 2018-03-06 23:01:03
Gotcha. Well, it is a lot of luck my friend. Take the gamble now or wait to see if it goes lower/higher. Although I feel the 15 minute chart looks pretty good. 
@_date: 2018-03-10 21:04:20
Bro. Do you have anything to do other than waste your time on here? I don't go to random subreddits I don't support, so why the fuck are you here?
@_date: 2018-03-14 17:36:03
Saw everyone freaking out and thought shit had been going down hard. Looked like just the usual 8am or 9am PST dip though? This has been happening almost everyday for over a week now?
@_date: 2018-03-09 18:58:22
I really wanted to try to day trade the dump today but I knew the second I sold would be the day they pump it instead of dump it.
@_date: 2018-02-25 23:42:47
This had me laughing for a good two minutes. Thanks!
@_date: 2018-03-04 23:33:49
Here we go bitches....
@_date: 2018-03-07 20:08:33
Okay? My main point still stands. It will NOT drop to 4K in one day without something far more serious happening. You are right, maybe the buy wall will be elsewhere but a 58% drop over something that isn't at the level of Mt. Gox in one day won't happen. Keep dreaming. 
@_date: 2018-02-26 02:59:34
This is the truth. Gave me some serious FUD talking their Sunday night dip and now I'm on the sidelines with puppy eyes. The night is still young though I guess...
@_date: 2018-03-12 20:19:56
If it happens in the very short term, it will happen tomorrow. Hoping not though. Hoping not.
@_date: 2018-03-09 20:57:55
Ohh gosh. Tell me about it. Lol
@_date: 2018-03-10 00:18:04
Has the Sunday dip happened the past two weeks? I think it's due to happen this week.
@_date: 2018-03-06 22:22:10
Doesn't matter. If there is a red candle on the one minute chart. It is safe to say we ARE crashing. 
@_date: 2018-03-09 01:58:50
If he feels he wouldn't be comfortable loosing money further, I don't necessarily think selling is a bad idea. I wish I had sold earlier but now I am so deep in losses it wouldn't be worth it, :(
@_date: 2018-03-07 18:27:32
Haven't you seen enough brutality for one day?
@_date: 2018-03-07 17:50:57
But what was the rumor. LOL
@_date: 2018-03-09 01:57:00
You were correct.
@_date: 2018-03-09 06:24:35
@_date: 2018-03-12 20:32:19
Hmm. I don't know if it's just people dumping out of fear. If it was in a steady downtrend throughout the day, I might believe that but it just falls of the cliff at specific times. I'm thinking it's likely whale bots. Obviously a little bit of it is fear no doubt but I'm thinking it's mainly whales.
@_date: 2018-02-26 00:55:36
Looking at this post three weeks later.... Plenty of people bought at 6K and they didn't even have to HODL for more than two weeks before they doubled their money. Just sayin'.
@_date: 2018-03-09 17:34:03
This made me choke. Lol
@_date: 2018-03-10 21:11:51
Just did. A few days ago he said 4K by weeks end. Now he's saying 4K by April. He's a flopper alright.
@_date: 2018-03-09 20:06:33
After every sell I make there is a pump to be had. After every buy I take there is a dump to be given.
@_date: 2018-03-07 19:02:12
I am thinking we will see the mid 8Ks in the next few hours. :(
@_date: 2018-03-08 18:46:21
Don't sell right now man. I promise, you won't regret it in a few days. Never sell on these red candles. We should have a green one tomorrow.
@_date: 2018-03-07 20:24:43
@_date: 2018-03-09 01:02:07
Erm. What?
