I think you have some more prospecting to do.

Is there a reverse of that site where you advertise yourself and then turn down people that contact you if the jobs aren't interesting enough? :P

sorry grandma. try hitting ctrl-z.

They are all highly speculative, but quite enjoyable to read. I don't think that people rich in Bitcoin will have any more control than people like Bill Gates do now.

You don't, you can generate the WIF private key. 64 rolls of a hex dice will give you that. You can also use regular 6 sided dice (100 rolls) and then use a standard unix command to convert those rolls.

This is only an issue if they aren't buying their island with bitcoin. It will get there sooner than you think.

I don't know enough to verify that the software I'm using doesn't have issues (generates keys from a small subspace). I like to roll dice to make my own keys.

London and its industry of finance will be the hardest hit by Bitcoin. They will do their best to resist it, no matter what comes out of their mouths.

Cheer up Johnnycoin, I'm sure someone will give you a tractor for your bitcoins. Why don't you ask these guys:

Why should I use Peter Todd? Isn't he a little argumentative?
@_date: 2014-11-03 22:27:19
Same gut feeling here.
@_date: 2014-10-24 01:29:57
wow, this is a good solution.

Are you pm'ing all these people the list? In that case, can you pm me it?

Time will fix this.

And in 10 years maybe 0.43 bits.

This is not the way to do it. You publish the list. Then you set up a receiving address for each domain. Then you give the domain to the person who sent the most to that address and can prove ownership of the address. You may not get much, but at least people will pay a little to get something (unless someone else pays more).

I got my $10... eventually... I can't complain.

Re payments: you send 100 around enough times and take 5% off each time you are left with something real small. Forget about volatility being a concern when the parasites are taking 5% off every transaction adding huge amounts of friction.
Re distribution: it doesn't matter what the distribution is, it could be far worse in Bitcoin and it wouldn't matter because there is no continual wealth transfer from the poor to the rich, and if the rich want to sell out, that only helps the distribution.
This article seems like FUD to me. Good luck getting cheaper coins ;)

Here are the times smiling dave likes to publish his articles (may not be 100% accurate as I don't have time for these sorts of people): 
The four dots on the left happen before that time where there is no price data from bitstamp.

It's easy to say 'decentralise all exchanges', it's another thing to implement functionally. Centralised exchanges provide numerous benefits at the moment.
@_date: 2014-10-23 12:03:44
This is not a sensible way to approach things... centralised entities are highly beneficial in some instances. Without exchanges, Bitcoin would have no value at all right now. It's just that they should have been regulated to a degree.
@_date: 2014-11-03 22:10:45
Not sure why the downvote. Some people have no sense of humor.

At least they named it appropriately. Would you like to buy some aether?

That's not an issue, you just use two independent softwares, and if they give you the same address, then you are fine. You can be extremely confident that they don't both have the same issue. If you are still having trust issues, then you can use three. The important part is getting your private key yourself.

When you post multiple times, people think you are desperate for attention.

It does require labor and technical knowledge. This should not be a problem for the poor receivers though as the amount they save for that labor will be extremely worthwhile for them. Also, if this happens enough, small semi-centralised networks will emerge where people sell their bitcoins to the local high volume seller and this high volume seller sells them on to people who want bitcoins (the rich in that country). This means that the high volume seller can make a living just doing this and they can also help every person with the technical barriers.

No one wants to be like Russia and China... the way things are panning out looks very promising. 'They' don't fully understand the true potential of Bitcoin and will be quite blindsided by it. Defectors of fiat will abound. Read some of these articles:  ... and tell me what in there you disagree with. They are the most pro Bitcoin posts I've seen... anywhere, and I'm afraid that I tend to agree with them. 
@_date: 2014-08-08 22:31:31
How about you buy 1 BTC from me for $1000000. Just before that though, buy quite a lot at market value... this way, you are sure to make gains when the price goes up.

You don't need a safe. Sell all your gold and silver, buy bitcoins, create BIP38 encoded paper wallets with a single reasonable password and leave multiple coppies around your house.

No one wants to risk keeping their money in altcoins at the moment. Oh wait, a few people. The foolish.

You are ignoring the type of remittances where the receiver of bitcoin is a seller on something like Mycelium local trader. Sure, the migrant worker has to pay 1-3% over market rate to buy it in the first world country, but given sufficient demand, the receiver should be able to sell it anywhere from 5-10% over market rate. This is because it's harder to get bitcoins in third world countries because of capital controls. This means that the process is actually a net gain, nevermind being better than current options, they gain value when they move their money in this way.

The sad thing is that centralised entities like this that hold other people's bitcoins should be regulated to a degree to prevent these sorts of scams from happening. Bitcoin should not be regulated, but organisations that hold other people's bitcoins should be.
