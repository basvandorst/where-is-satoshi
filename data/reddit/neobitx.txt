Let me know when they start listing their products using Bitcoins...

I wouldn't be surprised if that's how Maduro's cronies are planning on taking their funds out, now that now even [the Swiss]( are giving them trouble to move their money. Any independent bitcoin operation is still a clandestine operation (even though bitcoin it's legal)

My main issue I have with localbitcoin is the need to share banking / id information with every potential buyer / seller if you want to have the funds transferred electronically, there are no ways to "email" money like paypal (well, there is Mercadopago, but that's limited to I think $30/month or so). With Surbitcoin, I was not too comfortable either, but it was like dealing with only one guy
Anyway, the point seems moot at this point since [Surbitcoin has halted their operations](

rumor has it that there is [one bakery in Caracas]( accepting them.

if it looks too good to be true, it probably ain't true (and if it's true, it ain't going to last long)

Well I sold at 750, start the withdrawal request, 2 days later no signs of the withdraw and only excuses via chat. BTC surges to 900, I'm pissed off (I could have waited to sell at 900), 4 days more go by, withdraw  still in process, BTC drops to 720, I cancel the whole withdraw and get the bitcoins out. Yay! I made a tiny profit, yet the whole point was getting VEF, so I end up losing trading elsewhere. Luckily I was not counting on those VEF to eat, but I could see that becoming more of an issue. Surbitcoin is broken for me (at least at the moment), they even suggested I should open an account in Banesco (one of their friendly banks I guess), but then I see their facebook post about having issues with Banesco's API.

Wouldn't this actually have the opposite effect? I had trouble withdrawing fiat (VEF), It was taking more than a week, so I cancelled and bought bitcoins instead and had those delivered to my wallet within a couple of hours. They have problems with their Venezuelans banks, this should be pushing the BTC price up (what else could you do with the VEF you can't withdraw). I think this already happened, since I saw a peak close to 900k VEF/BTC
Now, they could be having issues with deposits too, which could be reducing the pool of potential buyers for those bitcoins people need to sell to cover basic stuff. Localbitcoins prices are about 100k above
To me, this is not looking good for Surbitcoin. I want to be wrong

So something like a blockchain.info wallet,  is it safe? 
Edit: I got my answer [here](
