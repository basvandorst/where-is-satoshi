bitfinex should be willing to return the losses to its users over time.

What kind of hate do they get if you don't mind me asking?  I use polo and find it great. Never had any kind of problem.

A decade from now I'll wave at you from my yacht.

Haha, pretty much along the lines of what I was going to write. If they are worried, then I want to buy more. Bitcoin is IMMUTABLE.

This con artist clearly just wants to find a way to scam people. I wouldn't be surprised if he claimed ownership of all bitcoin. If he truly is S.N. he would be able to PROVE it.

So how is this not a pyramid scheme?

A dinosaur letting us know his kind once ruled the world. Enjoy extinction Stiglosaurus.

Let them know that the entire banking system is propped up on consumer banking which will eventually collapse for various reasons. Then let them know that bail-ins are the new bail-outs and when (not if) the next global financial crisis hits, they simply won't be allowed to access their own money (remember Cyprus?).  Just saying :)

Check again bro, pretty sure I sent you 10btc

Random chance that they started the chart from 2014? I don't think so.

Bitcoin is digital gold, let's see how quickly people can send physical gold to the other side of the planet.

I wonder how long until centralised governance is made illegal by DAO's?

I will try buy land using Bitcoin in a private agreement with the owner. The 'official' amount on the contract will be €1. What can the authorities do to prevent this?
@_date: 2016-07-06 06:19:44
Good one bro. I have no job, a mounting study loan (somewhere between €50k-€100k, too afraid to check). But I'm pouring cash into Bitcoin, I have 5btc now. I promise, we'll be rich soon.

Also trade. Pump and dump any/all shitcoins in order  to increase your Bitcoins holdings. The market is full of predictable idiots who basically throw money into any altcoin simply because other people have done so. Like taking candy from a baby.

It's terrible how much control government's have over us and our finances. What's even worse, is how much the public trusts them...

I think it is possible to quit my degree and tell them I wasn't able to complete it due to medical circumstances. They would write off the entire amount.
