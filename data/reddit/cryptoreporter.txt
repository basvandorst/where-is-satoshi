I think this is the problem. They only have a ghost office or virtual office in HK for legal reasons and it provides some forms of safe haven and/or privacy from U.S. authorities (same for their addresses in the Virgin Islands). I have a few friends that have opened accounts in HK for this very reason. The Bitfinex "staff" are comprised of a handful of employees located across the globe.

Just received SMS from Bitfinex the security breach has been resolved.
Investigating - We are currently in an ongoing process of restoring limited functionality in a secure environment, with full functionality coming afterwards in progressive stages. The first step is bringing the site online and allowing users to login and view the state of their accounts. Note that initially trading, deposits, withdrawals, and other core site functionality will be disabled. 
To accommodate the relaunch, all withdrawals, open orders, and open funding offers will be canceled. Furthermore, in order to compute losses for relevant parties, settlement must occur in the affected accounts. Margin positions for all pairs will be settled and closed using the following prices, representing the midpoint of the bid and ask on August 2, 2016 at 18:00:00 UTC: 
BTCUSD:	604.06000000 
ETHUSD:	10.19050000 
ETHBTC:	0.01689900 
ETCUSD:	2.83700000 
ETCBTC:	0.00471495 
LTCUSD:	3.75180000 
LTCBTC:	0.00621295 
Further announcements about the next steps of the relaunch will be posted as progress is made. All significant changes to feature availability will be announced in advance. We will strive to keep you as informed as we can.

Questions, questions. 
- Who has the most to gain from this hack?
- How exactly did it happen? Through server access.... or a Nigerian email that a Bitfinex employee clicked on?
- So which sorts of people would have the detailed information how Bitfinex runs everything?
- When will Bitfinex go live again?
- Besides hard forking, is there any way for the bitcoin world to block usage of those stolen coins?

Im just looking for a digital "wallet" where i can move BTC into USD instantly while BTC price is dropping and then from USD back to BTC when price is rising. Ive had Coinbase forever and they do have this USD "wallet" feature but they charge the standard 1% fee. Moving $20K is going to cost me $200. This is effing insane since im not doing a ACH transfer back to my bank account.
I just tried the Coinpult wallet. Sent myself $2 in BTC to USD... not sure if the 3 cents was the BTC transaction fee or a conversion to USD... Will try transferring a larger amount, but so far looks like the best option.

The email came directly from Clef stating that their users accounts &amp; servers were not affected in any why by the Bitfinex hack.
I take that to read users Clef accounts, but Bitfinex accounts would still be susceptible to the breach. Clef just allows you to log into your Bitfinex account more securely. I dont think it protects fund transfers (but i could be mistaken).

Without posting links and doing research (scotch whiskey is gooood) I have read that 2FA is completely hackable. Theres dupe software to simulate a persons phone to receive SMS and run a ghost version of android on a desktop (with a phone 
Bitfinex should look internally to see if their email servers have been hacked into in the past year (should really have 2FA on emails also, especially if operating in the bitcoin world). Email accounts are a lot easier to hack into than a bitcoin account. Its really the weakest link and if someone had months to read through Bitfinex emails they might have found a way in.

Im using a google chrome app called "ARC welder" which allows some APK to be run on desktops.

Legally speaking, yes. Many of the people who filed correctly with the Mt Gox claims will be receiving their coins back sometime this year.

Can we get some discussion on how this could have happened? Although we dont know the full details, we do have some info such as only bitcoin wallets were affected and there is also a connection to BitGo which I find interesting theres no news on their blog or twitter account. Kinda feels like BitGo had to be compromised first. Would love to pool our brains and think of the possibilities of how this could have happened.
@_date: 2016-08-23 17:19:22
Frankly, I would just use Coinbase BTC to USD wallets but they still charge a 1% fee between wallets as I understand it.

@_date: 2016-08-22 19:33:08
So YES it is possible but the options available are basically the same as Bitfinex. You give up control.
Essentially what would be ideal... a multibit or armory offline wallet where I can convert BTC to USD. I would think this would not be too difficult to do. I sent 1 BTC to my USD wallet and price is locked to USD. When I do this with Mycelium/Coinapult all Im doing is sending BTC from one address to another address. Coinapult locks in the USD rate. Im guessing Tether USDT works basically the same.

So bottom line... if Charlie was just a regular person and not a company he really doesnt need to follow any KYC or AML since he wouldnt be classified as a business.
Lets say I just transferred 100 BTC from my wallet to my sisters wallet as a Christmas gift. Was I supposed to report that or only if I was a business? She cashes some of it in with her new coinbase account. What if she, in a year, decides to buy some mary jane while at a night club off the coast of Greece and she told me she might. (yeah, you do wanna know my sister). So would that put my in the lockbox like Charlie?

I ended up not getting into bitcoin mining back in 2011 which was a mistake :| I did finally start some miners early 2013 at around $75 after the price had peaked over $200.
My friend sent me 0.05 bitcoins during that first bitcoin chat, what is now $15 today (5 cents back in 2011). I checked blockchain and the wallet he had sent from had 183 bitcoins in it. He retired at the age of 40 when BTC reached the $200s. We all used Dwolla/Mt. Gox back then and we both always transferred our coins out daily. A buddy of ours (who didnt listen to us) has well over a million dollars stuck in Mt Gox still. Luckily he had some offline coins that he cashed out to pay for a new house.

The government isnt poor. The NK government has plenty of money.
So the link between the two is this... When ever there was uncertainty in the world we would see gold prices go up. Bitcoin is gold 2.0 and much easier for NK to obtain than gold. They can make their own via mining. The missile launches provide the uncertainty needed to push up bitcoin price, ie "Gold 2.0". Similar to a fireman setting fires for job security.

This is a test post because the article I posted an hour ago about North Korea is still sitting at 1 view. Apparently anything in /Bitcoin or /Bitcoinmarkets with NK or North Korea in the title is being scrubbed.
**The Connection Between North Korea and Bitcoin Price**
With recent news that NK is mining bitcoin (  ) and NK hacking South Korean exchanges (  ), its clear that North Korea has plenty of skin in the bitcoin atmosphere. That said, could Kim Jong Un specifically be launching missile tests to boost his profit? Could the missile launches be correlated to bitcoin price?
I went back to the beginning of 2013 and although I provide no graph there does appear to be some connection. The 16 or so missile events since 2013 the price of bitcoin has gone up an average of 16% with only 3 times did it drop after a missile launch.
List of NK launches... 
We know North Korea has had a thriving bitcoin economy for at least 3 years... 
However, I dont know how long Kim Jong Un has been in the state run mining biz. NK has really increased their missile tests in 2017 and bitcoin price has really moved up.
However, the last 5 missile launches this year doesnt seem to have had as big of an effect on price with only an increase in bitcoin price of 2.8% instead of the average of 16%
According to western news, NK plans more launches in the future. It would be interesting to know or find a list of projected launch dates.
For what its worth... top forecaster Martin Armstrong who predicted the 1987 Black Monday crash as well as the 1998 Russian financial collapse is "predicting" a major confrontation between NK and the US between now and September 12th.
Would love to hear your thoughts on all of this!
@_date: 2017-08-30 21:53:05

For anyone interested I have been testing a few options...
Vaultoro = converting BTC to gold. It took approx 3 hours to convert 0.1 BTC into gold. They also charge 0.5% per conversion each way.
Coinbase GDAX = Convert BTC to USD. Instant conversion. They charge 0.25% taker fee only.
Tether = Convert BTC to USD. 11 HOURS later and it still hasnt converted 0.1 BTC to USD. no fees for conversions.
Uphold = Convert BTC to USD.  Converting from BTC into a USD was instant. 0.75% conversion fee each way.
Coinapult = Easy &amp; instant to convert from BTC to USD and back again and out to offline wallet.  0.75% conversion fee each way.
Vaultoro is out of the running since gold fluctuates and they have 1% fee total. Uphold... Ok, it finally went through after 2 hours. It works fine, however I dont like their 1.5% total fee. Coinbase is probably the safest option and is actually cheaper than Bitfinex, plus its instant. Tether works pretty well until you convert from BTC to TUSD. I waited around 11+ hours (eleven!) waiting from the conversion to finish.

I have both Coinbase and Circle accounts. They were easy to set up and did not require anywhere near the amount of KYC info that WU asked for. It literally took minutes to do compared to WU. I personally am not concerned with KYC or AML. Im just sending money. Nothing secretive. If I had no BTC, Id have gone to Circle as its easy to set up and connect a credit card (get card points) and ready to send it to family half way around the world in seconds.
So cheapest method: 0% fees with Circle &amp; 3.5% with LBC in Moscow.
or... 0% fees with Circle &amp; family works deal with surgeon to pay in BTC and possibly save money too

**UPDATE  We walked into Western Union today to send the money. We were asked for the receivers name and their city/country. I was asked for my name and to flash my drivers license. This was an all verbal transaction, no need to fill anything out. The lady didnt even look at my license (i know, besides the point). I find this a bit ridiculous considering Western Union is a money transmitter, so where is the AML/KYC when sending money in person?
The clerk printed up the transaction and as I handed her my credit card we noticed that the receiver would not be able to receive USD even though that was how we were paying. The receiver would get 63 rubles per dollar. Yet, if my relative tried to cash the rubles to dollars, she would only get 70 rubles per dollar. A 10% difference. Its VERY obvious now this is how Western Union makes their money off of the exchange rates. They are arbitraging their clients :) on top of their transaction fees.
So the 10% difference in exchange of $50 + the $50 fee for instantly available money comes out to $100, or 20% in fees.

More importantly, whats the point of AML and KYC for Western Union if one can carry $500 in cash, obtain fake ID in any large US city and wear a baseball cap and Magnum PI mustache? The WU clerks dont verify anything. You dont need to give them your address. They just ask to see ID and if the photo looks like you thats it. Its a farce is what it is.

Do you know anything about linux? If I was in this situation I might download and burn an ISO of Ultimate Boot CD and then run it on your computer as a Live CD. Go into Parted Magic and run the ClamVirus scanner. Ive used linux for 9 years without a prob.

"Then why did you spend so much focus on it in your original post if you're not concerned?"
FYI... my wife filled out all the forms, not me. She was in the living room doing it while I was in the computer room. I also went to the bathroom during the hour she spent filling it out. Had I seen everything she had to go through, I would have cancelled it.
Point is its difficult to get people to change habits. I would have sent the coins and had family meet LB person and been done with it.
The KYC on Western Union was simple at first. Obviously Im concerned once it went past a certain point as it became more and more intrusive. The time involved with everything was also a concern. The Nigerian customer service was a concern. I pretty much laid it out in my post. GL

So I am back at home trying to do the transaction online again. This time using a credit card instead of my bank account. Any advice? Ive tried sending all sorts of amounts.... $500, $490, $475, $600 now... nothing goes through. If I send less ($100 or $200) the WU fees are greater, so Im trying to send around $500 since that is what my relative needs. Honestly I have no idea why its being declined. Never had this problem with WU before. Could it be.... P U T I N ??? haha

Obviously you are really hung up on ID and verification to obtain bitcoin. You want your bitcoin anonymous. GOT IT. Look, I like anonymous bitcoin too. Just be a good boy when buying your bitcoin, then run it through your Dark Wallet if you need to. If all that is too much then mine bitcoin. I am personally not interested about 3% fees from whomever. 10%? Yeah. Different story.

So is there any news on what Bitfinex is doing for their customers? I made good money on Tuesday during the crash. I thought the crash was insane so I was taking screenshots the entire time. I made my money, my account was credited and it was several minutes later after refreshing did I notice that Bitfinex had put me into a new massive margin trade, one I could never had made on my own with the bitcoin I was holding. Looking at my history in Bitfinex also backs up my story. I closed my trade, my account was correctly credited and then 3 minutes later, I was put into that ridiculous new margin trade (essentially wiping out all my profits). I had nothing to do with that. By all accounts, Bitfinex owes me that profit on Tuesday.

Not sure where you are looking. If I send BTC to a relative, they need to "sell" bitcoins. There are buyers in Moscow for cash transactions willing to pay anywhere from $203-$226 ($226, $211, $203, $223, $219).
There are a couple buyers out there with 100+ transactions. One guy has 3000+ transactions.

**UPDATE  After talking with a WU chat rep, I was advised to make the transaction over the phone where my voice would be recorded for security purposes. As with all of the extra information they have about me, they now have my voice fingerprint. I called WU, placed the transaction and as the rep was about to give me the MTCN transaction  he was shocked to see the transfer was declined. He told me directly that he doesnt think the Security or Verification department can help me with my transaction. He did have an idea! Go to a local Western Union again and pick up the secretive black phone and enter a secret code he gave me and the transfer will go through without any problems whatsoever (no joking).

Can you direct me to anything here? Ive read many times in the past about people who send funds to certain marketplaces and then their accounts are frozen or whatever, but dont know much about Coinbase/Circle giving too many problems over KYC stuff. Most of that gets verified electronically a number of ways through IP, geolocation, ID search, and other methods. Ive worked in the industry so Ive seen the steps and processes. Many people try to use VPNs to open accounts or info just doesnt check out and get flagged. Usually there is a key reason why people dont pass KYC. Western Union could not give me that information. One of the 13 people told me to just try sending the money again. Another person told me to send smaller amounts to see if it goes through (at higher fees).
@_date: 2015-08-22 00:12:56
Yes. I dont know how it works actually. Other online sites like Mint.com use the same protocol (whatever it is) to log into your credit card &amp; other banking accounts to scrape your data.

If you connect a bank account to Circle there are no transaction fees. The 2.9% fee when using credit cards is the fee they pass on from their credit processor.

It really is ridiculous. The future is already here. 
Your friend could put a simple BTC wallet on their phone. Any number of choices now. In seconds you send the bitcoins to them. They then go to Expedia, CheapAir, or wherever and book a hotel in a couple of minutes. DONE DEAL.
As with most peoples families, my relatives are too lazy to research bitcoin or install a phone wallet. So sending them bitcoin wasnt a big option for me. They could have spoken to the surgeon directly and asked if he would take bitcoin directly. Being Russian he probably would have ;) LocalBitcoins could have been an easy option with me setting up the entire thing for them and they just meet the person at a local bank. There are literally tons of Moscow-vites on LB with excellent reviews.
@_date: 2019-04-16 19:41:26
It depends on a users use case scenario. Maybe for you it has no real usage ;) But I can use bitcoin right now to send to family members across the world for almost nothing. Bitcoin is still a store of value, its relatively cheap to obtain, cheap to transact, payments are fast, no banks are required, no charge backs, etc. There are PLENTY of reasons why bitcoin continues to gain public adoption. If your use case is gambling or renting nekkid women then you just need to move your coins off of coinbase. Relatively simple.

Bulgaria? Russia? Cyprus? Czech Republic? Ukraine? Germany? Virgin Islands? They are fundamentally set up to exit scam at some point.

Good question really. The reason why I left them was I had asked myself these types of questions... 
* What do we know about BTC-e?
* Who runs it?
* Where exactly are they located?
* Why do they have whois guard on their domain name?
I never could get clear answers so no point risking money on an exchange I knew nothing about. Now, my rationale is... if I cant go to their place of business and knock on the door to talk to someone, something is odd.

Disagree on this. Its definitely news to BTC traders. Historically the price has risen $50-$80 in the week or two before the auction (its gone up from $236-$294 this time=$58) and in the month after the auction the price goes backdown to its pre-auction price. Then, continues to slide.
Just knowing this with a little research has made awesome $$ for us traders.

Just run the numbers. Lets say you have 1 BTC bought at $236, sold at $294. You just made $58. Not bad for one week right? If the price comes back down to $236 as historically is the case you can now buy 1.25 BTC.
If you did it on 3x margin at (insert exchange here) thats a $174 profit allowing you to buy 1.75 BTC when the price goes back to $236.
All hypothetical of course ;) Use charts, learn indicators/fundamentals, follow whale traders, use stoplosses, etc to gain better perspective and make smart trade decisions. Ive done well &amp; done bad. I'm currently doing quite well by getting away from day trading and reading longer time periods (2H, 4H, 1D).

A few months ago I converted all of my alt coins to BTC to transfer out (something like 15 btc) as I had had enough of Cryptsy. I personally noticed larger then normal "fees" when converting my alts to btc. I found it strange and while I didnt have enough time to investigate further, I did some calculations and they were triple charging me fees for selling some of my alt coins. And then.... *POOF* my BTC balance disappeared for several days! I sent a couple requests and all I got back was "it should be there". I waited a good 7 business days and my BTC re-appeared but I was down almost 2 bitcoins from the time they were there after converting my alts, then disappeared and then came back. I immediately transfered my remaining bitcoins out ASAP and then I complained and got zero reply. Glad Im not with them anymore.
The only reason this makes sense to me is they are having some serious problems and are about ready to ponzi everyone at some point and go dark.
