Put a graphic on your site that says "I accept Bitcoin", linked to a page instructing users to email you for a new bitcoin address to send their payment to.  Once you have recieved the funds, send off the shirts.
There may be automated services, and if not I am sure they are coming.  My solution is pretty easy to implement though, so I recommend it until a better solution comes your way.

Documentation.  Find your transaction in the block explorer, take screenshots of all correspondence attempts, then post it all on reddit and the bitcoin forums.  Mtgox tends to reply quickly when they see an angered mob forming.

One of the pains of BTC is that it takes about an hour from sending a transaction to the other client receiving enough confirming blocks to be comfortable considering the payment as "cleared".  A centralized debit system can have a reputation, so people trust information from them.  You put your money in the debit system, then you  can send up to your balance to anyone, and get instant confirmation from the trusted system that they have indeed sent along the BTC and they will be arriving shortly (and they guarantee that they will re-send the coins if the transaction didn't go through for any reason).  
This is currently something standing in the way of commerce with bitcoins, because waiting an hour for transaction to clear is not feasible in most cases.

I disagree: 


No, they will drop their selling price if the price falls.  It hasn't seriously fallen yet, giving them room to be hopeful.


Joe Everyone is buying bitcoins at $30 right now, and is going to be crying his eyes out when they drop. They are overvalued right now.
Also, you left out people who want to use bitcoins as a discreet store of value or exchange mechanism.
@_date: 2011-06-08 22:17:44
I disagree: I think they will stabilize between $5-15 until an economy gets started, and then will rise slowly.  The prices can only rise at this point from increased utility, or increased speculation.  I think spectators are starting to get nervous, recognizing that the bitcoin economy isn't truly worth 100+ million yet. People who are in it just for the money are going to start selling.
I don't have my coins yet, but I look forward to snatching some more up in two weeks when it comes back down to $15.

I have a used kleenex that, its very possible years from now will be worth millions of dollars.  I'll give it to you for a steal of only one bitcoin ;-)

HEY GUYS! I CAN IMAGINE THAT I AM A MILLIONAIRE!

I believe we will see a player working the debit model soon, giving users the ability to spend as many coins as they have in their account instantly.
@_date: 2011-06-10 06:41:11
There are clearer correlations in price changes with blog and media coverage.  
Google news is a good resource for anticipating price changes.

I came here to say this, but you already did so let me re-emphasize this point:
**someone else making money that you did not does not mean you got screwed.**
@_date: 2011-06-15 19:23:01
Sounds like the maintainer of bitcoincharts is in possession of stolen property.  They guy who runs it can probably be legally compelled to return it.  He probably should voluntarily to be a good guy.  It could threaten the system if people can be compelled to return transactions.
@_date: 2011-06-15 01:06:38
Build a bitcoin debit system, which allows you to instantly confirm payments, so long as you have already deposited the funds with the service.  It is centralized, so it can give instant feedback.
@_date: 2011-06-15 19:36:00
I think a reasonably strong case could be made in court that stolen fungible goods (every unit is the same, ex. a pound of lead, a dollar bill, a bitcoin) must be returned in equivalency without necessarily needing to prove that it is the "same" bitcoin/pound of lead.
@_date: 2011-06-10 06:12:52
If I have a farm, and grow my own food, and sell it, where does the $$ come from?  others buying it for $?  well, in a very direct way, yes, but not really.  Are they 'losing' because I am making money?  Absolutely not.
 **The money comes from the fact that I have created value**.  Early adopters increased the value of the bitcoin economy by participating: the more people that recognize it, the more valuable it is.  All of them "paid" for their tokens. They did not affect your wallet whatsoever.  Nobody lost anything. The world has become more wealthy.
Greedy speculators will lose money, and people investing into the bubble without understanding it will lose money, but that is not the early-adopters fault or responsibility.
@_date: 2011-06-24 01:11:23
Haha, I completely forgot about this from all the craziness of the past two weeks.  Thanks for the reminder.

**If you don't plan on encrypting and backing up, don't buy bitcoins.** 
Bitcoins are cool because they are (theoretically) more secure than storing them in a bank.  By keeping them in a simple, password-accessible account, your money is actually less secure than in a bank.  
@_date: 2011-06-17 19:11:57
Either you don't know what literally means, or you should go to the hospital.
@_date: 2011-06-22 22:17:26
Does anyone know if you can send bitcoins to the same address that is it from?  will the transaction go through?
@_date: 2011-06-09 00:35:39
"cannot" is much stronger than my sentiment.
I, and I presume others, would love to snatch up coins for pennies on the dollar, just as an interesting new way to send money to friends.  As the price falls, people like myself who love the idea of bitcoin but don't think its economically prudent to put money into a bubble will buy some of them.  
I think plummet to zero is unlikely unless governmental action or a security hole threatens their security.  Otherwise, someone will want them, if only for their ability to conduct illicit trade.  I think the speculators are going to get out, and it will flatten within the next few months.

I would be extremely surprised if it hit $30 in the next week.

By definition, the early-adopters used to have 100% of the market, some purchased, some mined.  The bitcoins wouldn't just be sitting around unclaimed, they have to belong to someone.  Early-adopters are controlling the release of money with the rate they sell their BTC, but they did not and likely are still not "buying" the market.
Speculators are the ones keeping late-comers from being able to buy at a lower price.  They created the bubble.  They should be the object of our disdain. 
@_date: 2011-06-10 19:03:38
Great article. This.

I would call the Mt. Gox hack incident of selling down to $0.01 the first crash.  
@_date: 2011-06-08 23:07:28
No, but the rewards of mining will stabilize at the cost of electricity to generate it. 
@_date: 2011-06-10 17:36:43
Good point.  An application which facilitates BTC transfers is probably much **better* for the economy than just a new merchant opening up, because the application will help hundreds of new merchants accept BTC.

Are all stocks pyramid schemes as well?  In those, the creators of the company offer a commodity (the stock) at a low price, with the intention of selling them at a higher price later so they can make money.  
Welcome to the economy.

Not everyone is using btc to buy drugs and hos.  Legitimate transactions perhaps
@_date: 2011-06-08 22:19:32
You could say that... and you would be wrong!
@_date: 2011-06-29 00:45:38
I think the Mtgox incident stabilized trading because it scared away the speculators who were making the price jump +/- $5 a day
@_date: 2011-06-09 00:42:01
If this was posted today, why does it have an outdated price?  It is at $30 on MtGox right now. 
@_date: 2011-06-10 19:27:53
There are a lot of bids at 22.  it will hold steady for 6000 BTC at that point.  It will probably close around there tonight.
@_date: 2011-06-08 22:49:26
**Late-comers are not getting screwed.** 
This is a free market.  Everyone has the choice whether to buy in or not.  If the price is below or equal to their value to you, buy them.   If you buy bitcoins at a price higher than their value to you, you are a greedy idiot.  Idiots always screw themselves.  Whats the problem?
@_date: 2011-06-10 07:35:31
upvoted for humility
@_date: 2011-06-09 20:42:13
Making a choice that is a poor financial decision is not "getting screwed", it is "screwing yourself".  I think it is an important distinction.

Wild swings will me happening in the next two weeks.  The recent changes have been from a huge increase in awareness. I am sure more news coverage is coming, but I would guess that at this point the majority(&gt;50%) of interested nerds are already aware of it.  I think it is going to settle down.

At current price of $26.44 and 6.5 million coins in circulation, the entire bitcoin economy is priced at 158 million.  If you compare that to all non-currency goods and services you can purchase with BTC, I think it is easy to see that there is not yet $158 million of purchasing power yet.  
This page has many of places you can spend your bitcoin.  There are less than 1000 on this page.  
  
Do you think the average merchant is earning anywhere close to $158,000?  No way.
@_date: 2011-06-11 18:53:23
I am an ideological bitcoin enthusiast, but I wasn't able to buy bitcoins before the big bubble.  Once it comes down and stabilizes, i plan on putting a couple hundred in to seed a digital economy between me and my friends.  I anticipate there are many others like me.  I doubt it will fall below $1 or $2, but if that is catastrophic, you should probably sell now.
@_date: 2011-06-11 19:06:46
I was quoting you.
@_date: 2011-06-10 06:56:20
There are a **LOT** of people holding bitcoin with just that intention: getting rich quick.  In terms of the utility of the money, it is grossly overvalued, by a factor of 4-10x by my estimate.  
Bitcoin is a promising new technology, which I am also very excited about.  But **the price reflects the future exchange value, rather than the current value**, which is considerably lower.   If the bitcoin economy (as in what you can spend BTC on) does not grow fast enough, speculators are going to pull out their money.  This could cause a crash.
I am buying bitcoins when they equalize with their real value.  This means either a dramatic price reduction, or a dramatic increase in what you can spend them on.  I hope for both!
