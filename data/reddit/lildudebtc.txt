1. I think a usb pendrive is best way to solve OP issue n°1 even if after it evolves into an NFC card, the software would remain similar.
I found here a process for usb pendrive: 
But the process is a bit complex, if there was some script or aplication that would do all of this without having to move file around manually it would be nice.
2. Just wait a couple of months. Its like paypal in the beginning, nobody accepted it, look now. Also just look at the main reddit page about bitcoin and see how many companies are starting to accept bitcoin.
3. For a person that has tried to buy bitcoins for the last week, UNSUCCESSFULLY, even falling by lack of luck in the bitcoin-24 mess...I must completely agree with you. Its DAMN HARD to buy bitcoin, in europe at least.... I mean i'm willing to spend lot of money on it, but i can't.
4. Agreed. But bitcoin is actually simple, there is just too much not needed explanation. Only needed explanation is this. BITCOIN IS LIMITED THEREFORE IT WILL ALWAYS HAVE VALUE and by extension it cannot be created out of thin air, it needs to be mined, like gold, mining requires time and resources which guarantees bitcoin will always be worth at least the cost to mine (like gold, diamond, every limited resource). 
Actual problem with Dollars, Yens and Euros (not yet but soon) is when a crisis comes where money value drops and drops (cause of banks playing with the buy and sell game), government just needs to print more money (which is creating money out of thin air basically), so bank can continue playing with it and that creates inflation in the process since its costs nothing to create. Real money is just feeding on itself and that must collapses sooner or later.

From what i understand only the German bank account is available but he can't send money out of it due to very low limitations on money sending. So from there, you have two possibilities:
1)You wait and wait and wait till your lawyers manage nothing (just knowing the German govt has not yet contacted you tells it all), and then in a week or a month the German account gets locked too and we are all fucked.
2)Reopen the site as fast as possible to let your customer use their money which is in your personal German bank account. Even if we can't move OUR euros from your account, at least we can buy bitcoins and get out there before OUR money is definitely locked/lost in the German government bureaucracy. 
After all, isnt this one of the reason why bitcoin exists ? So it's not under government control ? 
Please let us access bitcoin-24 and use our money before its too late.

"The Germans think now, that I am trying to get money with this methode. So they look now, where I have money and try to close all bank accounts."
You know what is coming, you know OUR money is going to get locked and lost.
You MUST act now not tomorrow or in a week, and start reimbursing / giving back access to the user, or the situation will be worse and worse for each second you wait without CONCRETE Action.
This is the way you solve problem, you don't try to calm down people with words, overall when their money is in the trade. YOU TAKE CONCRETE ACTIONS so people start calming down.
The more you wait, the more people will fill complains/take legal actions. At a point which is getting closer, it won't be about money anymore, but about your liberty, YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE, you are in charge sir.

I'm done with waiting. It's been more than 72 hours since MY money is not available, we have NO ETA at all on when site will be back (if it will). So i just mailed my banks on the steps to take so I get my money back.
And I'm sure they will ask me to go to the police and fill a complaint for scamming. And i will do it in 48h max if its the only GUARANTEED way i see my money back.
I've lost even MORE money considering that if bitcoin-24 did work i could have bought BTC at 50$, and since now its 100$ i'd have been on x2 money. I should ask for interests imo...

It is one thing, we all agree, that Simon is guilty of many of the problems happening now, and im the first to point at him, HOWEVER most of the question you are asking have actually been answered in the irc log previously linked, so you didnt even bother to read it, you just had to search for &lt;TAiS46&gt; and it would have taken 10 minutes. Make some efforts please.

Let's say i bought 1000$ worth of bitcoin at that moment. Now i'd have 4 bitcoins, worth around 400$. I'd hold around 60 to 75% of my bitcoins, because if i sell everything it would be pure loss. I'd use the remaining 40 to 25% so i try to make for my 600$ loss day by day. If you look at a daily graph, you should see a pattern on when the prices go down and up, and bet accordingly. You should be able to make 10 15$ per day per bitcoin (but you have to factor that this variation isnt going to stay like this for long, market will stabilize one day or another). So if you use 25% or your 4btc, it should be 1btc. If you make 10$ per day, it should take you around 60 days, to get your money back.
And I'm sure it will go up again to 300 400$, just because people like new technologies, and being able to pay with money which is no money but is money. I give you a hint on another very probable crash. When BFL ship their ordered ASICs. Price will drastically go down, as the hashrate drastically increase over the world, it means more bitcoins on the market, means prices go down. However price will rapidly go up again as difficulty increases and less bitcoins are discovered.
And another crash is probably when bitcoin-24 will come back, but i'm doubting this will happen the more times passes by.

Is there some program that would move / create a wallet to usb pendrive so i can use this wallet only if my usb drive is plugged in ?
So if I want it safe i just need to unplug it.

Im not sure the German bank account is frozen, he says:
"The Comerzbank (German bank account) is closed in 2 Month....
Why is not the Commerzbank still closed? The reason is, that it is not so easy in Germany to close an bank account within some minutes like it is in poland."

See If I had my money I would buy right now, or in couple hours max....right now BTC is at 75$ and going down, I'm pretty sure tomorrow it will go back to 100$, that's an easy +25%.
edit: 64$

This is just what is needed to be a bit reassured Simon. We need to know what you are doing, and when you hope it can be done.
WHAT and WHEN. Just answer those two questions as often as possible and people will be OK.
Even if you don't meet the When its OK, just explain WHY. We understand its not easy, at moment we just need TRANSPARENCY, clear water TRANSPARENCY.
