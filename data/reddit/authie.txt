A would really recommend a Ledger in this case. it's a hardware wallet that makes sure your funds will not be stolen, better spend 58€ to secure 20,000$.

That's a pretty awesome plate! maybe he bought this Volvo by buying bitcoins in 2011.

Everyone wants your information to buy bitcoins online. That's why I only buy coins for cash or using a bitcoin ATM.
@_date: 2016-11-14 14:45:22
But, for example, when someone withdrawn their bitcoins from mtgox, which wallet was sending the tx? I suppose they had one giant wallet like most exchanges. or maybe they had many small ones?

Looks like it works in my country but I don't have an Amazon account. how long does it usually take until I receive bitcoins from there?
@_date: 2016-11-08 16:18:15
Okay, I might try them out, thanks!

Most people use HD wallets nowadays. blockchain.info is an HD wallet and so is Bitcoin Core.

The Nigerian prince is exchanging all the cash he earned to bitcoin.

They sell the keys for a little higher. People send them BTC and buy keys at around 2.1x$.
@_date: 2016-11-06 14:46:02
That's a REALLY high fee. fees of around 0.1$/250byte get me a next block confirmation, beyond that amount you are donating to the miners (: And 1$ is still really high and not needed.

Oh, thanks for the explanation man. Glad to see this little centralized alert system getting retired.

Those are basically 15 USD notes.. 
@_date: 2016-11-08 17:53:04
Yeah haha, 2.0x USD, the 'x' represents cents. the price is changing.
@_date: 2016-11-13 16:56:33
Haha. let's hope you won't make a "$600!" post soon.

I have a feeling Trump's gonna win because of this thread.
@_date: 2016-11-14 13:20:10
They probably had a cold storage wallet with most of the funds (or maybe a hot wallet, in Mtgox's case) even if it was much smaller than the actual number of bitcoins people had onsite where is it? nobody knows the address?
@_date: 2016-11-08 23:43:11
Honestly haven't really tried them, but I'm pretty sure they require IDs and such and I'm not really into giving personal info.
@_date: 2016-11-15 07:21:59
Looks really awesome, looking forward to see it supported outside of Europe.
@_date: 2016-11-09 13:28:34
Would love to see it implemented!

Damn I bought a Nexus 5.

When they release the notification key to the public, will people running earlier versions receive many messages because everyone has the key and can make an alert?
@_date: 2016-10-22 18:03:38
Maybe they send different emails based on the IP address. does it look Google-translated?
@_date: 2016-10-25 00:35:03
Looks really good. always had good experience with BitPay.
@_date: 2016-10-27 13:11:15
A chance of one in 328166830 doesn't sound like a really good one. Especially when the prize is only 12.5 BTC+fees.
@_date: 2016-10-22 11:10:40
If they pay him in a way he could cash out without a raid on his house I think he might seriously consider this option. He's gonna have a pretty big trouble exchanging the stolen bitcoins for anything else.
@_date: 2016-10-27 13:27:16
More like 1 USD = 0.0014 BTC
@_date: 2016-10-22 15:30:48
Just noticed it myself, 670$/BTC on Bitfinex. Maybe inside news about the hacker?
@_date: 2016-10-22 16:37:04
It's weird they managed to target you in your native language. you have no accounts on German websites with this email?
@_date: 2016-10-21 12:44:28
Bitcointalk was hacked recently and emails are not hashed because they are used for password recovery, it makes sense.
@_date: 2016-10-21 11:52:56
If the email was only used for Bitstamp then I guess someone got hold of the emails in their database.
Can you post the scam attempt you received so people can confirm they received the same thing?
@_date: 2016-10-22 22:29:09
Really weird then. maybe they send all email in German and it's just a coincidence? do you have any guess?
@_date: 2016-10-26 14:34:45
5.5GH/s, so pointless.. you're never gonna find a block with that hashrate.
