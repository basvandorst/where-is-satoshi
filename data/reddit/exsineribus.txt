thanks a ton for this, most helpful information I've gotten thus far.
dumb question incoming though, why are there some wallets with millions in btc and why is my ledger wallet never changing?

noted lol, I think I will go with what was suggested (using a different address) 
I originally wanted to just confirm all the transactions manually anyways so I can know how much is going where and make sure it arrives in the ledger and everything.

thanks for the info! 
it would be 100% online, software.  Can't give good numbers as not sure how many ppl would start using bitcoin but I would say under 10 a day.  It would be ~$100.
Will look into btcpay for sure! I was just seeing if I could get the process down to two input fields, btc address and email.  I wouldn't mind having them manually approved at first as its a bit experimental

just adding, I would love for this to be an option to just accumulate coins.  Trying to just have it go straight to the ledger.  Sort of like a btc savings account lol
If I have to use something like bitpay or some 3rd party I suppose I can, I feel it almost defeats the purpose

forgive me, I only have a ledger right now, just getting into it.
Is it possible/easy to simply just send your transaction with a "note" or "message" so the person is able to know the wallet really does belong to them?
I suppose someone could email you first, say "my wallet is X" and then you say "my wallet is Y", right?

messaging part?
And honestly the simplest solution might be the best, not expecting a huge rush of ppl using bitcoin.  I might just set it up as a live chat sort of deal, confirm the transaction then send it.
trying to think a head though (and scaling) not sure how best this would work if two people happen to buy at the same time and we only get one transaction.

I suppose that is a possibility.  Just trying to make it as simple as possible though.  
I'll do a bit more research then go with a plan, thanks for the suggestion though! its definitely on the table now! :)
