i've never understood the logic behind this, unless the three groups are the NSA, Mossad, and KGB the long and short of it is no, and I'm not even sure those groups would be interested in doing that.  What value is there in crashing the currency when the represented hardware cost hundreds of thousands if not millions of dollars that become essentially useless if the value of the currency is debased.

irrational as far as overarching policy, but specific "covert" initiatives are a staple of american government, and this undoubtedly sounds conspiracy-minded, but I thoroughly believe the government to have individuals intelligent enough to see btc for the opportunity it is and act on it.

at the current time, nothing, market cap well exceeds anything that would be touched by silk road, not to mention legitimate investors have moved into market who would actually respond favorably if it shut down.

I've thought ever since I first heard of bitcoins that the government would have loved to have thought of it first and replaced paper currency with government databases that do almost exactly what the blockchain does.

its not just out, i was to have 8.7 btc hit my account an hour ago, still waiting on them,  I'm guessing that its just major overload right now as much new business as is coming there way currently.  I will say I have been extremely disappointed with their customer service, but I have had no previous problem depositing or withdrawing

Right now, there is no reason.  But the money the speculators has injected into the market is fueling innovation that is going to shape bitcoin into something much more market friendly.  I would like to see a chain of bitcoin based "western union or moneygram" style cash places.  I'm not an expert by any means on the subject, but I would believe using bitcoins as the backbone for such a service would significantly reduce operating overhead.  Since Bitcoin wallets can be attached to QR codes, why is it unfeasible that a ATM style machine that is redeemable around the world in a local currency could cut out almost all overhead.  Instead of paying western union 15% you can text a QR code to anyone worldwide and instantly redeem it for cash at a minimal charge.  Of course this could create some centralization as you would have to hold the coins on a specific exchange, in order for the company operating the machines to verify the value instantly as the blockchain will likely never "verify" instantly. Western Union operating income in 2010 was $1.3 billion, whereas current market cap of bitcoin is roughly $500 million.  This is just one possible future innovation to be a part of what bitcoin can eventually become.

haha, its def not big money, there is just no resistance, its a sellers market right now, and I think that is only going to become more dramatically the case in the next few days.

not really any different as a percentage than other dips

there is nothing to worry about, they are just really backed up, they've been operating beyond peak capacity for over a week now. I had a transaction get stuck where I was purchasing coins, last night.  It came through about 4-6 hrs late, not to say that these are typical times.  I also sent btc, and that hasn't went through yet 12 hrs later

this is the best argument for bitcoins I've ever heard.

this is the most interesting thing anyone has said on here in days

I'm waiting for resolution for a similar issue, I was told by support that standard procedure was to honor the transaction, but so far they have only offered me a free .3955 btc on a 14.5 btc transaction at $34.50 that they failed to respond to me for 4 weeks after repeated emails from me.  For now I will reserve judgement because no question they have been up to their eyeballs in new customers and "growing pains" due to the explosion of bitcoins, but if this is the only resolution I'm offered, I told them they could keep it and I'd bring my grievance to the forums and see what the public thinks.  Keep in mind I was considerably proactive in requesting the transaction be honored immediately after and repeatedly, now they have told me this is standard procedure, and yet currently they refuse to honor the transaction after not responding to my requests in a timely manner.

this sounds extremely accurate
