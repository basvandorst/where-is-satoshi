There is no such thing as free energy.
No wonder you guys believe Lightning network actually works.

Literally a who bank

It was hacked just because you don't like the content?
@_date: 2018-01-05 21:11:44
He will never use Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-05 21:26:25
Yeah, until the network gets clogged up.
I'm still waiting for simulations showing 1000000+ random nodes making transactions all over the LN using simulated real world constraints. 
@_date: 2018-01-05 21:02:38
LOL wasn't LN designed to allow Bitcoin replace Visa? What the fuck are you crying about? 
@_date: 2018-01-20 16:09:24
I thought LN coins had lower fees and 10 times faster than Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-05 21:30:05
You might as well keep using your current bank and avoid the hassle.
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:25:33
Holy shit, Bitcoin is beyond dead if this is the average bagholder.
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:22:10
And he doesn't even know about Bitfinex.
@_date: 2018-01-05 21:36:00
If there are thousands of routing failures when using this highly idealized model I don't even want to think how many routing failures will occur when this atrocity starts being used under real world conditions.

Says some random twitter user while my grandma is already talking about Bitcoin.
wow such facts, many confidence
@_date: 2018-01-05 21:56:58
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:21:11
I don't see the slightest relationship between any of those charts.
@_date: 2018-01-05 21:20:43
Except doge, which is actually faster and cheaper to transfer.
@_date: 2018-01-05 22:01:45
Yeah, this reddit has been going south for a while.
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:11:35
What? I'm not talking about religion here, LN is inconsistent with the original Bitcoin protocol, that's a fact.
@_date: 2017-12-27 03:23:26
You sound like a religious fanatic who bought ATH and now you are expecting a miracle because you think LN is a real solution to this mess.
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:08:12
Is it p2p? No.
What's the title of the whitepaper? Yeah.
LN is just another thing.
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:04:14
The relationship between Tether printing and Bitcoin price rising is undeniable. 
I think most of you are just being selectively blind to this issue.
@_date: 2017-12-26 23:21:52
I thought you were testing this since 2016. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:04:46
Any INDEPENDENT readings?
@_date: 2017-12-27 17:37:53
You are just a SECT.
@_date: 2017-12-30 21:31:09
You are not even talking about the awful fundamentals that triggered this crash, rendering your analysis is pointless.
@_date: 2017-12-28 20:19:30
No drama, people with really large positions started selling since 20k, that's it.
@_date: 2017-12-17 17:30:48
LOL, is that even a fact? You are pushing those LN numbers unbelievably high.
Where are the studies demonstrating that LN under heavy loads can carry that amount of tx?
@_date: 2017-12-26 23:24:27
Seriously, that's your best answer? A conspiracy theory?
We'll see who is the liar when LN ends up not working like it should. Good luck with your bank layer.
@_date: 2017-12-27 03:15:31
You clearly don't understand what p2p  and POW mean. By the way, there ZERO guarantee that a LN node (which is just a fancy name for a centralized BTC bucket)can find a path between you and your peer unless the network grows exponentially.
@_date: 2017-12-26 21:51:50
It already did and then it crashed.
@_date: 2017-12-27 01:08:00
I'm having a hard time finding a relationship between a centralized non-p2p 2nd layer tx solution (these are facts) with miners competing with each other to determine who will add the next block to the database. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 18:23:06
Maybe Bitcoin Cash won't be fast, but it will always be p2p and trustless.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:52:29
LN is not a solution, otherwise Bitcoin price would tell a different story.
Stop pushing this.
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:22:20
@_date: 2017-12-27 17:38:26
Nope, no results, I just can't publish a new article. I give up.
@_date: 2017-12-27 01:00:53
Nope, not my error.
@_date: 2017-12-28 18:11:06
Bitcoin protocol doesn't depend on trust, that's why it works and that's why LN will never work.
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:47:57
Preaching requires fanatism, and that generally implies a personal interpretation of a source of information. I'm just reading the title of the original whitepaper, nothing more. LN tx's are not p2p, that's it.
@_date: 2017-12-27 17:37:37
They just downvote everything that isn't 100% in line with their internal narrative, like a sect.
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:08:51
Funny how skype, twitch, youtube and snapchat are ALL CENTRALIZED.
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:29:34
Of course I want Bitcoin to evolve, I just think LN is a step back.
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:12:24
LN is not a real solution because it cripples the original protocol.
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:09:26
I'm worried because IT IS NOT p2p
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:48:03
If you think LN is the solution you might as well use a credit card or a bank transfer
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:16:34
Crippling the protocol = destroying the ability to do real p2p transactions. LN is just a banking layer, that's it.
@_date: 2017-12-16 01:05:37
Three of those questions have clear answers:
if Bitcoin is going to crash: Yes, definitely.
if high fees will kill Bitcoin: High fees kills anything honestly
if we're in a bubble: Yes, 100%. We just don't know when it will pop yet.
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:00:14
It doesn't makes sense.
@_date: 2017-12-26 23:30:51
It is centralized and also not p2p, because with LN your transactions rely on a third party.
@_date: 2017-12-26 22:01:27
I'm just getting constant payment errors. "Great stuff"
@_date: 2017-12-27 23:55:29
@_date: 2017-08-02 02:10:04
That's what payment channels are for. Blocksize increment just delays the issue, and at the same time centralizes the mining power even more.
@_date: 2017-08-01 18:07:40
LOL, he is losing it
@_date: 2017-08-01 16:51:48
Nah, it's meant to be a joke. Google it
@_date: 2017-08-25 14:50:40
It's an altcoin named Bcash.
@_date: 2017-08-01 15:55:18
DELET THIS
@_date: 2017-08-01 17:41:54
Textbook shitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-03 22:32:22
All cryptocurrencies = BTC + alts.
@_date: 2017-08-03 03:59:10
I stopped reading at "without 2FA". Sorry 
@_date: 2017-08-25 14:57:07
A separate project?
Bcash is BCH lmao.
@_date: 2017-11-14 17:26:33
It says two confirmations.
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:45:37
I've been here for a while now, thanks. On the other hand, I have no clue how the hell are you decoupling tech limitations from current market behavior. This crash is a delayed response to a lot of things, including the awful problem of scaling, which is yet to be solved.
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:35:18
Nodes with more funds (BTC banks) will overtake smaller ones because those nodes will naturally create more paths due to high liquidity, therefore centralizing the entire network.
@_date: 2018-02-01 15:06:58
Blockstream must think people is really, really stupid to believe this crap:
- unlimited transactions per second
- truly instant confirmations
- high level of security
What the fuck is this?
Unlimited? Seriously?
Not a single one of those things is true.
This sounds like an ad, a really cheap one.
@_date: 2018-02-01 14:37:09
They are a chip manufacturer providing hardware for efficient mining. 
They are not buying Bitcoin lmao
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:20:34
Centralized funds are 100 times worse than having a centralized mining force, which will still exist if LN goes live (big IF).
Ligthning Network implies having the original blockchain mostly in charge of Bitmain just like today + centralized nodes with lots of liquidity, so you are just adding a new problem to an unsolved one.
@_date: 2018-02-01 14:43:53
No one really likes Bitcoin Segwit, but without it fees and transaction times spike like hell.
This is a lose lose situation
@_date: 2018-02-01 15:07:35
Because it probably is.
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:35:33
Confirmation time metrics are only relevant when the network is fully populated (+100000 users), which is not the case.
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:22:24
- automatically rejecting nodes with higher funds to avoid centralization
Yeah, THAT will never happen.
@_date: 2018-02-01 15:13:16
If you close the channel during a transaction I assume you keep Bob's money captive, unless this thing has some sort of time restriction to reverse a failed transaction.
Now, imagine if all nodes start doing this lmao.
@_date: 2018-02-03 15:47:59
LN is centralized control of wealth because only the biggest nodes will have enough liquidity to keep transactions alive without filling the entire network with bottlenecks. This protocol is dead on arrival and I will be laughing my ass off when you finally realize you made the wrong bet with LN.
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:35:16
I agree.
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:56:09
Why would you assume I'm freaking out? lol
We are talking about BTC here though, which is &gt;50% down since the bubble popped, and I'm ok with that.
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:09:14
@_date: 2018-02-01 14:38:58
Confirmation bias in a nutshell. This is getting sad
@_date: 2018-02-01 15:15:49
Yeah, going from 2 usd to 1 usd, from 10k to 5k, from 20k to 10k is exactly the same as going from 100k to 50k.
No difference at all.
@_date: 2018-02-01 14:47:28
Yeah, because hitting 10k while going up is exactly like hitting 10k while crashing and burning.
Holy shit.
@_date: 2017-07-24 13:05:12
BCC is an altcoin.
@_date: 2017-07-27 13:22:12
Well the infrastructure to move money directly from one person to another is already here, and it's groundbreaking on it's own because it solved a hard problem that no one could effectively solve before. Look for the Bizantine Generals' Problem, it's pretty interesting and I'm sure will make you scratch your head quite a bit.
Also, code has the advantage of being extremelly flexible in the hands of professional developers/programmers and it can be adapted to handle a wide variety of problems given enough time, BUT code should never become so incredibly complex because the risk of error naturally rises with complexity. So, my guess is, if legal writings are complex on their own, in order to map those writings into code with 0 risk ideally, the law itself should start adapting at some point, and by extension, the state.
 If we all want an interface between the state and the economics of Bitcoin, then the state needs more wiggle room, otherwise this economic system will start naturally growing it's own rules by simple demand, and those who can't keep in pace will eventually see their internal economies slowly collapse. Why you may ask? Because in the future, why would someone prefer a piece of paper that says he owns some car in his state, when that person can easily prove to anybody in the entire world (and without doubt) ownership of that same car because there is unbreakable cryptographic proof of it? Which weights more, a piece of paper with limited validity, or cryptographic proof with undeniable mathematical validity?
That's why Bitcoin is much more bigger than people think, and I have no doubt that this transition will happen this century. 
@_date: 2017-07-24 17:25:12
Wow, easy there fake satoshi.
@_date: 2017-07-25 13:23:16
Was creating a temporary scam coin named BCC part of the agreement? Was violently disturb the market before 2x part of the agreement?
@_date: 2017-07-26 16:17:03
I can't even comprehend how people literally threatening to harm the entire network to get what they want can talk about integrity even for a second. If that's integrity, then a 2 year old kid has integrity too.
@_date: 2017-07-31 17:06:39
That answer is so stupid in so many levels.
@_date: 2017-07-27 00:51:20
The way I see it, a smart contract tries to replace human signatures, complex bindings and major institutions with digital signatures, complex code and the blockchain respectively. 
Translating complex legal writings into code could take years though, but I figure that, for example, a simple human invoice for buying a computer can be easily mapped into the crypto space by encoding your computer serial number signed with your digital signature into the blockchain at the moment of the transaction, so it can be used as proof of ownership. That's one simple example I can imagine but I'm no expert.
@_date: 2017-07-31 19:14:26
LMAO, so it's even worst than I thought. Thank you, I will be installing that BCC, BCH, BCwhatever software on some old computer that I don't give a fuck about. 
@_date: 2017-07-26 23:55:33
This is a slightly technical video, but it's pretty well made. In a nutshell, smart contracts could be perfected to transfer property directly between two peers without intermediaries:

Do you understand what happens when your original Electrum folders are overwritten? Are you aware that Electrum's official twitter is advicing against installing this Electron Cash software in the same machine because it is a really poorly planned release?. No wonder the website is being locked by A/V software.
@_date: 2017-07-26 23:41:27
Do they have some sort of 2FA validation? If that's the case, did you enable it?
@_date: 2017-07-25 01:03:45
I knew BCC standards were low, but not THIS low. 
@_date: 2017-07-25 15:27:56
Making sure by threatening the entire network. Nice.
