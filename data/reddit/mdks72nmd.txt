Taurus and QuadrigaCX are fully Canadian exchanges that I've tried.

Everybody is biased, no surprise here.

Lol, that's silly. They are owners, not admins. Which means they can do whatever the hell they want with it.

Digatrade is weird, they never really try to attract customers and promote the exchange. I'm happy using QuadrigaCX as well as Taurus for arbitrage opportunities.

Buy and sell from local traders or bitcoin ATMs. Problem solved.

Use Coinbase with the tradeoff described by the OP. Use a bitcoin ATM with the tradeoff described by you above. It depends on what is more important to you.

[E-coin.io]( looks interesting. Has anyone tried it? How does it compare to Xapo when it comes to reliability?

Apologies, I didn't intend to hurt your feelings. I simply believe that both Bitcoin and projects like BitMarkets do not need to succumb to the current "mainstream" perception of the world. They are here to disrupt the very notion of money and trade as we know it. Those who are afraid of "dark markets" or "black markets" are not ready for them and will be the last to adopt them, which is fine. When all markets switch to this model, there will be no distinction between "regular" and "dark".

This transaction was sent from my bitcoind wallet a few hours ago. I see this message when I paste the tx ID in the search field on blockchain.info. However, if I paste the receiving address, I can see it but zero incoming transactions.
On Biteasy it's vice-versa: I can see the transaction if I put the tx ID but if I paste the address Biteasy says they don't have it in their database.
A fee of 0.0001 BTC was paid.
Now, what do I do about it? It seems like the transaction amount was deducted from the wallet.

As long as Taurus offers 0% fees, I'll stick to them for my random purchases. Canada is bloated with exchanges already.

Bitstamp has been nice most of the time but they started asking too many questions recently. With BitLicense I expect them to become even more intrusive.

You can find the black and white design across all their projects. It's minimalistic and has everything you need. 
As for the wording, it doesn't matter. If you care about colorful VC-backed non-anonymous storefronts with ponies, flowers and "careful" wording, wait for OB. If you need a decentralized anonymous marketplace that works right now, try BM.

Go for QuadrigaCX or one of the smaller exchanges like Taurus or Cointrader. Cavirtex was good in 2011 when there were no options, but now you have more.

For now yes, although many get an MSB license anyway just to have it when the laws are there.

Thanks for the video! 
Does having Trezor eliminate all these steps? Trezor is basically an offline single-purpose computer, isn't it?
@_date: 2015-08-10 22:38:27
Awesome! It'll be interesting to see both concepts (OB's third party escrow and BM's Nash equilibrium) compete.
You guys need to do some more marketing as the market seems dead but I'm sure it will pick up as soon as people do a few successful trades and spread the word.

Canadians don't need a license to sell bitcoins yet (unless they are in Quebec) but the lawmakers may make it otherwise soon.

My withdrawal on Taurus was fine. Not sure what they use for their hot wallets but wouldn't higher transaction fees resolve the problem?

QuadrigaCX, Virtex, Taurus, Cointrader and now Kraken and Coinbase. Quite a few options.
