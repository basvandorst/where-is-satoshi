Great. But when is it coming? A few months and Bitcoin Cash takes over as digital currency.

If you invest in it A LOT, you're gonna say such things A LOT

2 things I wish someone had told me 6 years ago:
1. Mine it!
2. Save your SSD!

Finally, something that really is a big deal.
Wall Street buying actual BitCoin and not printing funny money from spot prices like the futures do.

Holding 1 btc is like being extremely nervous 100% of time
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:28:58
This should make Bitcoin prices less volatile

Every investor should know as much as possible on his investment, and knowing enough means he is closing in on insider info. Then he must graft the regulators to keep them off his back.

Dont accept bitcoin tips. As you said its gonna crash, so you better use another payment method.﻿

Everything he says is a lie. bcash can't use the developments from bitcoin because it doesn't have segwit, and how is it better than litecoin, bcash is just a clone of an old version of bitcoin without all the updates. It is a cheap imitation pushed by scammers like Roger Ver. The only difference with bcash and the old version of bitcoin is that bcash changed a parameter that will make it worse for the future, while bitcoin unlike bcash will be able to scale with lightning network.﻿

You can't pay taxes on bitcoins. THat's just stupid
THey may want you to pay taxes on fiat but not crypto
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:39:25
It's about quick gainz not the "idea" haha
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:36:48
THIS is the kind of people we need representing cryptocurrencies. Not rude and selfish people like Roger Ver.﻿
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:24:24
People always forget this.
Bitcoin is not just about "quick gainz". It's a new paradigm
@_date: 2018-03-06 15:05:26
I'm unable to uninstall or install any new apps. I don't get any confirmations on my ledger when trying to do either. Anybody have this problem before?

And if the said crypto used for paying taxes increases in value, will Arizona need to pay capital gain taxes to the federal government?
Just a thought, probably stupid but hey...
