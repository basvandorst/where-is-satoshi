Thanks for your submission! I wonder what % of investors actually fit into the “not your keys, not your coin” paradigm.

I’m a student at the Georgia Institute of Technology doing research on investor behavior in crypto. I'd greatly appreciate if you could take 5 minutes of your time to fill out this [typeform survey](
Posted this yesterday as well and got over 100 responses! Thanks to everyone that already filled it out. I'll keep posting for another 2 days to get my desired sample size and will then stop bothering you guys.
Once again, thanks for your support so far!

Good question! I would speculate that there’s a large percentage of investors who are in the space because they believe in the underlying technology, and also a significant portion who are in it to have control of their own money.

Hey r/bitcoin,
A week ago, I posted [this survey]( in several cryptocurrency subreddits and daily discussions. My goal was to learn about investor behavior in crypto, and I received **over 200 responses**! Thank you so much for your support. If you'd like to see the results or have any questions, check out this [Reddit thread](
For the next part of my research, I'm diving deeper into market demographics and looking to gain more insights into your investment behavior. Here's the [follow-up survey]( and thanks in advance for your time!

Good insight, I was trying to make it as simple as possible! You're right, just because you're together doesn't mean you have to get married. Thanks for participating either way. Much appreciated

I agree 100%

Thanks for catching that! Just edited. 
I'll keep that in mind for the next study and try to find out exactly how often people check their investments in a given day.
