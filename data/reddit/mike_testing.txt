I think it should be pronounced as hold but written as hodl. When there can be silent letters in word, we can also have this. In due time, when bitcoin reaches the moon, it will be included officially in Oxford dictionary!!!

And you can run your mining grid from university electricity!

I need a t-shirt with this quote.

Do check this.  As I  understand it is based on mesh networks. Seems to be quite popular in Europe.
@_date: 2017-12-18 18:26:13
How are you verifying the information? Without any verification, it would invite lot of shitty lies.

You may be interested in looking at Himalayan Institute of Alternatives, Ladakh started by Sonam Wanghuk in India. He has become a household name in India thanks to a recent  blockbuster Bollywood movie '3 idiots' which is supposedly roughly based on his life on trying alternative models of studies which are more practical than the rote learning which is being followed generally.

He was a visionary in so many ways.

For someone who is a regular reader, I can say from my experience that you will soon get used to this and start participating. The sub discusses everything new, tech and non tech both. If you stay long enough, then you obviously don't come to the sub for just regular info which is available on any search engine, you come here to be part of the community, to celebrate the good times and to warn about the bad times. Just hodl on the sub and you will enjoy it.

And 15 Bitcoin Cash which she is going to get for free. :-P

I agree mining cost may not be profitable in immediate future. I am more interested to be part of it to keep it as a decentralised currency. I am looking at it in the long run. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 18:48:39
Surprised that nobody else was interested in this. Looks like I am missing something in understanding about bitcoin mining.
@_date: 2017-11-04 20:18:14
That is one way but then doesn't it fail the purpose of bitcoin if mining is not so decentralised? Shouldn't we make it more and more available for users to run mining hardware so that even that is decentralised.

Thank you all for explaining it to me that the issue is more with respect to USD.
@_date: 2018-03-06 02:06:30
Oh thanks. Can you suggest some place where I can find the number of wallets with non-zero bitcoins and how it has changed overtime.
@_date: 2017-09-16 19:44:11
Me too. From what I could understand, it seemed reliable for a newbie to buy some with USD.
@_date: 2018-02-25 19:30:24
And people said bitcoin is all about distributed systems and technology. /s
@_date: 2017-10-22 18:25:12
But since number of transactions is limited in a block, 1000 transactions of $10 may not be same as 10000 transactions of $1 as not all of them might fit into same number of blocks like the 1000 ones. 
@_date: 2017-09-16 19:48:35
So many gujjus here. 
@_date: 2017-10-30 16:56:51
So how do you find out the stats about the new wallets being created? Also I was told by someone that wallet's public key is used to verify transactions from the wallet. Where can I find public keys of all the wallets. How is it distributed amongst miners.

Definitely we don't know what position US would have been, but it also definitely wouldn't have been in so many wars and it definitely wouldn't have armed bases across the globe. If you think that the debt is being used by US to develop the nation, you are in for a surprise. Check how much each wars have costed the US govt and you will know how the debt has grown to this level.

If secondary layer ensures that users have to pay less fees, then doesn't it mean in all miners would get less fees for mining those transactions when they come to primary layer. What am I missing?
@_date: 2018-02-23 17:55:41
Didn't know that. That would be interesting, looking at large entities running mining operations and trying to balance each other out.
@_date: 2018-02-18 12:41:57
Reminds me of matrix. Why, why do you stand up?
@_date: 2018-02-23 17:12:46
But how do they buy BTC? In this case they are hoping that the crypto being backed by their oil reserves will give them a way to get money out of it. So this is the only way they could.
@_date: 2017-10-22 18:31:25
Ok, got it.
