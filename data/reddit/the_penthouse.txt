Can you talk more about the tax side of things? Say that you sold of $200K worth. Obviously - you have to pay tax on that, so does that tax liability come from the $200K you sold immediately, or are you simply obligated to pay your tax come tax season?

Love it so far. A little bit slow/buggy on Windows. One little thing though - can you add the ability to resize the window?
