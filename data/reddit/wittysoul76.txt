What Lefthello said. With the Ledger Nano S, you get three tries to guess your pin and then that specific device is done and reset.

Yes, you order a new one and initialize it with your old seed words to recover your wallet.

What I’ve read seems to suggest you trigger taxable events when you either a) cash out or b) trade them for alts. Not when you simply move to a wallet. Let me know if you conclude otherwise.
@_date: 2017-12-06 04:13:47
Good question. The former. I’m wrestling with the latter myself. I think miners can use solar or wind farms (with batteries to take care of the intermittent production) to mitigate the carbon footprint concerns.

Sure, you can create raw transactions and transmit it to the network yourself. It’s a great way to learn about bitcoin. Here is a good read:

Miguel, great article. You made some really good points that resonated. Gotta fall in love with the tech first, see the valuable problem it solved, have a tiny vision of the future possibilities and the rest will come. The price today is almost the least interesting sideshow.

Sorry I’ll do my own research but is this essentially taking SCRIPT and adding opcodes to it like loops to make it Turing complete or is this based on a completely new language?
@_date: 2017-12-01 14:08:40
Sounds good! 
@_date: 2017-12-04 20:06:28
Got it, thanks! Seems like the best of both worlds. Get the power of a full Turing complete language while leaving the main chain protected from dumb/malicious code. Easiness craziness that ETH has seen lately.

Pretty awesome!

Start with Andreas’ book Mastering Bitcoin. You can skip past the lines of code if you want to.
The Princeton book was also very helpful.

From Mastering Bitcoin, Chapter 10
Satoshi Nakamoto’s main invention is the decentralized mechanism for emergent consensus. Emergent, because consensus is not achieved explicitly—there is no election or fixed moment when consensus occurs. Instead, consensus is an emergent artifact of the asynchronous interaction of thousands of independent nodes, all following simple rules. All the properties of bitcoin, including currency, transactions, payments, and the security model that does not depend on central authority or trust, derive from this invention.
Bitcoin’s decentralized consensus emerges from the interplay of four processes that occur independently on nodes across the network:
Independent verification of each transaction, by every full node, based on a comprehensive list of criteria
Independent aggregation of those transactions into new blocks by mining nodes, coupled with demonstrated computation through a Proof-of-Work algorithm
Independent verification of the new blocks by every node and assembly into a chain
Independent selection, by every node, of the chain with the most cumulative computation demonstrated through Proof-of-Work

True, their new DAA would kick in very quickly and jack up the difficulty in that scenario. I got it. Thanks for the dialogue. Here’s hoping miners stay rational.
@_date: 2017-11-16 07:28:32
Hmmm, you may be on to something here. Let me see if I'm understanding you right. Jihan and co switch to mining BTC and the increased hash power will cause a difficulty increase in a few days (when the current 2016 block set wraps up). That's then locked in for two weeks, and during those two weeks, they turn back to BCH and the BTC mempool slows to a crawl (maybe they introduce spam transactions for good measure).
Jeez! I hope I'm being super far fetched here! What can BTC do to defend against this?
@_date: 2017-11-16 21:46:31
Good point. Thanks for that. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 05:51:26
Please do. I also posted a good link above.
@_date: 2017-11-16 21:38:07
Thanks for that response. Any thoughts on the related questions?
@_date: 2017-11-09 06:12:30
Oooh, thanks! That explains it. Yes, I did select a segwit address type when I configured the Ledger!
The stuff I am reading to learn all this (Mastering Bitcoin, and other online resources) are a few years old so of course I won't find segwit technicals there. I guess I will have to learn how segwit works later.
@_date: 2017-11-14 20:43:47
Wait, I understand your comment in the context of the EDA they had before yesterday's hardfork. Are you saying their new DAA is still vulnerable to this? It's not quite obvious to me how.
@_date: 2017-11-07 06:19:46
Thank you both. So, if the block reward is only known 100 blocks later / ~17 hrs, does that mean that the miner who created the block cannot then submit a transaction spending coins generated in that block for 100 blocks/17 hours? Isn't that penalizing them compared to other users whose transactions are essentially confirmed after 6 blocks and they can spend their received coins right after that?
@_date: 2017-11-16 06:02:30
If you (conservatively) only ascribe the "store of value" concept to Bitcoin, gold becomes a natural comp. Market cap of gold is of the order of 7 trillion USD. Let's say Bitcoin replaces even 25-30% of this. That's a 2 trillion dollar market cap. There will only ever be 21m bitcoins. At least 2-3m are forever lost. So 2T/18m = 111k/Bitcoin. That's one way to look at it.
Then, if you think it takes on other aspects of money, you can start looking at M2 or M3 money in circulation globally and use similar analysis, and the value rises meteorically.
As to why Bitcoin and no other crypto, I think the first mover advantage is huge because it's a large positive feedback loop of adoption begetting liquidity begetting further adoption etc. 
Plus I think they have really sharp technical people really playing the long game here - the whole scaling debate that you witness. Long term thinking wins out usually.

I guess the 160 bit unique address hash is still coming from a 256 bit private key to public key to ripemd160(sha256()) if I understand right, so someone else hitting your private key randomly is still the astronomical 1/2^256 probability.
This stuff gets more and more ingenious the more I dive into it! Brilliant stuff on the distributed consensus protocol  too.
@_date: 2017-11-16 21:49:41
This is what I think too. Thanks. As someone else pointed out, as long as reasonably low fee transactions are clearing, mempool being full of fake Txs doesn’t matter. Genuine people who put in the super low fee Tx’s can RBF up. I feel better :)
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:53:25
Yeah, I haven't felt this excited about something new in a long time :)
@_date: 2017-11-06 23:17:54
Thank you all for the quick responses. I understand why it is safe for a truly random address. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 01:02:43
If you want a light intro to it, Andreas’ book Mastering Bitcoin (free on GitHub) has the chapter on keys talking about ECC briefly.
If you want the heavy math (way over my head personally, but I still like to browse) look at Stanford Professor Dan Boneh’s free crypto course textbook.
Sorry would link, but too lazy to right now. Both should be easily found via Google.
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:44:18
Haha, nice!
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:12:51
Yes, definitely good to read *Mastering Bitcoin*. I'm also in the 'got the basics down and now looking to increase my in depth understanding' category. Also check out some of the more advanced resources at [Lopp's Bitcoin site](

Humans are bad at being random so don't try do it without something like dice.
Very true.
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:44:09
Awesome. Glad to hear that. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:31:48
You’re welcome. Start by reading Mastering Bitcoin. I’ve linked to a page where you can find that book online for free and many other resources elsewhere in this post. Good luck!
@_date: 2017-11-11 07:36:00
Right. I get all that and thanks. I was basically struggling to wrap my head around the recursive loop created by signing a transaction when the output of the signature is part of the input of the message being signed (under my old erroneous assumption).
Also in theory you can sign the string “I love dogs!” and the ECDSA would still only uniquely verify to your public key, proving you were the owner of the previous output. At least I think that’s the case. The specific group of bytes being signed doesn’t really matter I think. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 15:48:52
I think you mean milliBTC (8 in your example) instead of Satoshis. 1 Satoshi is 100 millionth of a Bitcoin.
Also note that a transaction has to be for at least a minimum number of Satoshis today. Anything lower is considered “dust” and not considered a valid Tx. There is a formula for it, it’s something like 550 sats today.
@_date: 2017-11-16 21:39:17
Thanks. Do you have any insight on the other questions?
@_date: 2017-11-16 08:00:45
It really is! And in the midst of unlocking some deep insight, I’ll have a random colleague come up and say “Reading about bitcoins? Tulips bro!” or some such shit. I just give a zen smile and move on.
@_date: 2017-11-20 16:42:01
So if your only movement with BTC is transferring from Coinbase to a hardware wallet, that transaction is not a taxable event, right? I’m in the US.
@_date: 2017-11-11 16:46:05
@_date: 2017-11-11 06:39:51
Oooh so you are not signing the current transaction but the one where the ScriptPubKey is coming from? Have I got that right? If so, that makes sense! Thank you both. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 06:25:12
Got it, thank you.
@_date: 2017-11-16 07:18:12


Sure, per unit is just easier to understand.


I think short term value is driven by speculation for sure, but ultimately if this continues to take off, the potential is massive. If you spend some time understanding  decentralized cryptocurrency, you might (like me) conclude one day that the concept is revolutionary and we are at the dawn of the next big thing like the Internet was back in the day. Valuation under that framework and mindset is where the gold and money supply comps come in.
Also, you might find it very useful to watch some of [Andreas Antonopoulos' videos.](


This is going to depend on how much mining hashrate ultimately comes into play. I think I read somewhere that the current bitcoin network consumes about 350 MW of power (roughly 1 Watt/Gigahash/sec currently), which isn't too bad (less than a single typical baseload power plant).
@_date: 2017-11-16 05:23:25
Maybe a miner got lucky on the first few nonces and found a hash less than the target immediately and they simply rushed it out to the network to get the 12.5 BTC instead of including a bunch of transactions and resolving the hash puzzle? I can see why some miners might do that and give up the Tx fees. I see someone commented that it happens quite often, wonder how often.
@_date: 2017-11-13 22:35:46
This is at the very essence of Bitcoin. This was Satoshi's genius stroke. This is part of bitcoin already from day 1, an implementation without this would not work as a (decentralized) blockchain.
@_date: 2017-11-06 23:35:51
Yes, thanks, this was the second part of my question. I guess a faulty wallet creator might use non-random addresses, and people using those might get their BTC stolen at a future date because some bot simply cycled through a subset of a deterministic (pseudo random)256 bit  address space in a reasonsable amount of time and hope to hit paydirt. It truly hits home for me the need for a true random number! Thanks.

Hi. I had a question about gdax, or rather buying/selling bitcoin through limit orders. Given the huge volatility in BTC, let’s say you set a limit order to sell at a price of 5.5k. If there is a flash crash very rapidly down to a much lower value, is there risk that your sell order will clear at a much lower price than what you set or does gdax take that risk and you get to sell at a price of 5.5k if it ever goes below that? Thanks in advance.

Hi, first post here! Have benefited a lot from reading various things here, so firstly a general thank you to all.
My question is if I had (say) 1 BTC I bought on Coinbase  pre August fork but then sell it (I know, I know I’m going to HODL most of my holdings but for this example let’s say I do sell it) before Nov hardfork. What happens to my 1 BCH which Coinbase has said they will make available to us in January. Is it transferred to the buyer without me getting value for it at time of sale? Or will the BCH suddenly show up in my name in January when Coinbase starts supporting it?
Thanks in advance!
