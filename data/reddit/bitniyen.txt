This doesn't seem right.  When you hold BTC in an exchange, you expect BTC related/hacker risk. When you have USD you don't expect this (unless it's an exit scam).

As someone who has six figures in assets on BFX, this seems logical and a better outcome than immediate bankruptcy.   A socialized fractionalization is painful, but really is the only legally defensible strategy.  Then, give us a token (without waiving legal action) and try to make that token worth something. If the DAO can raise $150MM, I'm sure BFX can make a token backed by equity/cash flows worth $70MM.  One thing you did forget however... How the fuck this happened!

mycelium.com has never failed me for a mobile wallet.  For long-term storage use paper wallet like bitaddress.org.  For something cool, use cryptoart.com, but be sure to change the private key for large amounts of BTC.  If you must go with an exchange, coinbase's vault works well.

Well said.  There were two reasonable options; **a small block size bump** until layer two solutions materialize or **incentivize nodes** making centralization a mute point.  It's disappointing the Bitcoin community couldn't come together on this. On the other hand, anyone that understands these simple solutions is able to reap the rewards from other coins that do.

As someone that has written a couple contracts on Ethereum and invests in both BTC and ETH, I would like to suggest that sidechains will not make alts useless.  This is not the nature of an efficient marketplace.   Companies that are more profitable than their parents, are better to spin off and leverage on their own.  The same will be for alts (assuming sidechains work)-- if they can securely stand on their own, they will.  If I am a miner, I will mine the most profitable coin.  If I am a contract creator, I will concentrate on the token with the most upside.  As a community that is supposed to champion decentralization, we should welcome this.  Let's evolve past the NIH and stop settling for less secure models.

Coinwallet makes a market in BTC. How do we know they don't have a short position and are using this "test" to manipulate the market?
edit:  Go ahead and downvote me,  but if done correctly, they could make millions here.  This is fact.  BTW-- I'm all for a blocksize increase.
edit2:  Does anyone know about coinwallet.eu?  Their address is a virtual office space.  I see nothing on them in archive.org.  Have they proven reserves of customer funds?  Are their executives known and can they guarantee they don't have a short position?  
edit3:  After some simple google searching, it looks like the only presence coinwallet.eu has are posts trying to rally people for another Bitcoin stress test.  This includes posts over at  Their site is a themeforest wordpress and their domain is enom.  I've sent a DM to them asking them to publicly declare the identities of their principals.  That shouldn't be much to ask if they are indeed based in the UK as stated on their website.  Whatever you do, do not send BTC to these guys!

They were truly compromise about a month ago, and weren't exactly forthcoming about it. BTW - the first I heard about the leak was Nov 30, when they sent me this email. 
Dear Valued Customer, 
On November 17, we were privately notified of an IP address leak vulnerability affecting the port forwarding feature of our service. Essentially, anyone connecting to a forwarded port on any of our VPN gateways could have their real IP address leaked to an attacker specifically targeting a PIA user. 
Within 12 hours of the initial report, we developed and tested what we thought was a complete fix, and deployed it to all of our VPN gateways. 
On November 26, the researchers who discovered the vulnerability made it public and we quickly noticed that our service was still vulnerable to the IP address leak in certain cases, despite our initial fix. After further investigation, we also realized there was a separate but related issue on our desktop client. To fix this issue we are releasing updated VPN apps to prevent any leaks. We released v.52 on November 27. 
Protecting your privacy is our top priority and although exploiting this vulnerability is difficult and requires an attacker to specifically target you, we feel like we let you down with our initial response. Please accept our apologies, we are sorry. 
We highly recommend users update to v.52 (or later) of the client. To ensure all of our beloved users remain protected, we have pushed an update to existing clients. Please update immediately from the application or visit one of the following links: 
Technical Facts: 
The vulnerability relies on the fact that a direct route exists between the VPN client and server. If the client accesses a forwarded port on the VPN server that is maliciously set up by an attacker, the client will use the direct route using the user's default route, bypassing the VPN entirely. 
Our initial fix was to block VPN clients from accessing forwarded ports on the same server at the VPN gateway firewall level, but we soon discovered a flaw in our desktop clients that made the fix incomplete. When the client disconnected, the direct route to the VPN gateway was not removed, thereby making users vulnerable even after they disconnected from the VPN. Beginning with v.52, we remove these "lingering" direct routes to the VPN gateway at disconnect time. 
Note: If you are connecting to our service with a native OpenVPN client, or PIA's Android or iOS apps, you do not need a client-side fix.

Agreed. This conversation is idiotic. I feel stupider for even trying listen to the idea that a merchant processor doesn't want the ability to provide cheaper transactions at scale.  They've lost a ton a merchants because of the higher fees. Moreover, the cost of running a full node for a non-bitcoin company is not in the hardware and bandwidth, it's the expertise to secure and integrate it-- which is why most will just use a processor.

If they incentivized nodes like some other coins, centralization would be a moot point. Some of these other coins won't bring down their stake requirements because they would actually have too many nodes.  There is a also the side benefit of locking coins away that drive up price and make it impossible for a 51% attack (can't buy enough).  Any discussion on this?

No. They said they would have both coins trading within four hours. When it becomes obvious what the market wants, they may rename B2X as BTC.  So, if the 2x price is only 15% they won't rename it. However, if the market price is reversed, you can bet they will.

Honestly, after this "test", I don't see the blocksize as that big of a problem. I just sent 8 transactions and all got confirmed on the first block.  I just raised the fee. The mempool uses a swap, so it doesn't look like that is a problem.  If fees get too high, more offchain tech will emerge... which is what we really need for microtransactions.  We need a bunch of competing offchain options that are quick, can scale, and don't store every 10 bit transaction forever.  Downvote me if you like.

BFX can't transfer out USD because Well Fargo (an intermediary bank) is blocking wires from their Taiwanese bank. No ETA on getting it resolved. You can transfer out in some other currencies, and more will come online next week (hopefully EUR).  Theoretically, the premium should be close to transfer/exchange fees, but a bunch of sockpuppet/shorts are screaming Bitfinex is insolvent with complete lack of evidence.  BFX has issued a statement that that they have all reserves dollar for dollar. Give it a couple weeks, and things will be resolved.  I wouldn't be surprised if BFX creates a new banking relationship that can't be blocked by Well Fargo.  Moral:  Don't panic on FUD manufactured on Reddit; don't bank at Well Fargo.

I don't argue that point. We should keep them as low as possible during growth.  My feeling is 2-3 cents now, about twice that after the halving, up to maybe $0.10 in a couple years.  This way, you use a lighting option for free (or close to it), or if it is a really important transactions, you pay a little.

You are so funny Atlas.  It must really hurt knowing you sold all your BTC, spent so much time trying to talk the price down, and watching it skyrocket.  Keep at it man. It's working!

Sure, but it is VERY hard... this is what BU is doing and it involves a contentious fork.  So, acting like 100+ computer scientists came it consensus is disingenuous when the power of just a couple people dictates what miners can vote on without a contentious fork.  Gavin had a simple BIP that bumped the block size, and miners were not even allowed to vote on it.

People on the other side of the debate would disagree with these statements-- hence it falls under the category of politics.  Again, if we are creating a vast new form of money, the average person doesn't have time to take sides.

@_date: 2015-11-12 06:34:52
The major dump in BTC from 1200 was caused by the ability to short. Shorting is why we are not at 100B marketcap now.  This recent correction is just that.  Too much world-wide interest in Bitcoin happening to be this cheap.  We'll see new highs before the halving.

It doesn't matter how many are in circulation.  It matters about adoption and security of the network.  As long as the block reward subsidy is in effect, it should be used to its fullest extent without sacrificing security. Put another way, $0.05 is nothing compared to the block reward.  Why charge it if it is going to prevent usage?

It's just a way for enterprise to spin up private chains for testing and later be deployed (hopefully) onto public ledgers.
@_date: 2015-10-13 17:09:05
Because creating shitcoins has more upside for the developers and investors.  This is why public companies spin off faster growing divisions from the parent company.  The only reason to put something on a sidechain is if the utility is not great enough to securely stand alone, or as in the case of liquid, creates utility for Bitcoin or allows for a permissioned service.  All successful sidechains will spin off to create alt coins -- count on it.


The counter argument is the mental hoops "some" bitcoins will jump through to centralize all progress onto one chain.

BFX became the dominant exchange because it offered p2p lending for BTC and LTC; it gave people the ability to earn interest on their dollars and crypto and traders to margin and short. Polo trumped BFX by allowing p2p lending for alts and soon became the biggest exchange.  The only way to beat polo is to offer more lending, margin, and shorting options (more pairs, etc).
edit: To add to this-- The good thing, after the CFTC investigation into BFX, p2p lending seems to be allowed under certain conditions (that BFX now seems to be compliant with). This, combined with the fact that polo has not been shut down, seems to imply there is opportunity if not more room. They just need to re-evaluate and execute.

@_date: 2016-07-31 18:27:05
You need to look at BTC Margin Funding.  Notice the jump in the total amount of BTC that is being borrowed.  Speculators will borrow BTC on the hope to buy it back at a lower price.  Remember, there are other exchanges, so the short is probably much larger.  If you believe the price of BTC will rise longer term, it's a good time to buy.  If enough people buy, the short will get squeezed and the price will rise much higher when they are forced to buy back.  On the other hand, if people panic, they will buy back at a lower price and profit.
