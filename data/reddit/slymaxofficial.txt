Users need a software layer to implement any developments, and that software layer will make it seamless. There might be a channel factory broadcast network developed using the BitTorrent protocol to match users into random channel factories seamlessly within wallet software, for example, and then you don't have to do anything.

What are you smoking? Do you just not understand LN?
@_date: 2017-12-28 22:10:20
I think this is short term thinking. LN provides fundamental and immediate benefits. SegWit just makes the chair scale a little bit but doesn't impact the user directly. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 21:24:09
There is no trust issue. Cryptography brother. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 12:56:05
Side chains enable coloured coins, ICOs, asset transfer, service markets, file storage, etc etc etc. 
A lot of newer bitcoiners don't understand the reason a) why people aren't up for increasing block size, b) that bitcoin has always been a base layer protocol capable of so much more. 
The answer to a) is because bitcoin is capable of scaling without increased block size, so block bloat is a problem to avoid because it isn't a solution to a problem.  
@_date: 2017-12-09 13:09:59
It could switch to proof of stake in theory, but that would be a hard fork. There's no need to switch either. In time mining fees and therefore energy output will be far more sensible and reasonable.
@_date: 2017-12-30 21:16:31
Give me a technical reason you're right, or I'm wrong?
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:23:50
You don't know what satoshis vision about asics was, other than that he did envision them. And bitcoin isn't satoshi. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 09:09:22
And bitcoin has the same. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 12:49:17
That is exactly what it means. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 12:57:12
Another point - there's been cross coin transactions between bitcoin and dcred and in theory it's possible with other coins/chains. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 22:12:17
You're not considering the future. Buy from a LN exchange into your LN wallet and transact with other LN wallets. In theory you don't ever have to go "on chain". 
@_date: 2017-12-09 11:55:12
The you don't know what bitcoin is capable of 
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:16:11
Segwit is required for lightning iirc
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:53:51
Bitcoin is capable of facilitating the same services. So I'm not wrong. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 07:06:30
Two different scenarios here: 
the first is you have your own LN wallet which was opened with an on-chain btc wallet. You have 1:1 representation and your funds are guaranteed. Even if you never close the LN channel.
The second, which you're referring to, is a virtual wallet. This is the same as an exchange account and as was the case at mtGox, doesn't have to have any real coin behind it. This isn't a LN channel. 
You asked about channels closing. Either end of the channel can close it at any time. Just publish the latest commitment transaction to the blockchain. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 21:53:22
Perhaps the bit you're missing is that each LN channel is between two parties only. You can't double spend. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 06:25:30
You are absolutely wrong.  Once the channel is open, commitment transactions are used to update the balance between the two parties. This is a cryptographic signature by both parties. Revocation keys are used to ensure only the latest version of the commitment transaction can be published to the blockchain to close a channel. If either party is dishonest and publishes an outdated commitment transaction, the revocation key can be used to assign all funds in the channel to the honest party (penalty). 
I'll Skype with you to explain all this is its helpful? Or discord.

I've been in bitcoin since 2012.... I sometimes forget to check the price once a day. That gif of mr bean on the rollercoaster, that's me. 
The previous two bubbles though, I had bitcoinity on my second monitor permanently. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 07:41:45
But why is that actually a problem? People aren't required to spend from their wallets. It's just coins in limbo a far as the blockchain is concerned. And from users perspective although the channel isn't required to close either side can close it at any point. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 22:08:22
Yes, hence why LN channels are opened and closed on the public ledger. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 22:07:50
That's exactly correct. But that vendor may have channels open with other vendors and transactions can be forwarded through the network. Hence lightning network. Same as the theory behind ripple. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:53:11
I'd like to ask you the same question. Fees will come down with lightning without bloating the public ledger. And mining electricity usage could be absolutely minuscule without negative effect. It's just so profitable right now that people pump a lot of power into it. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:25:15
True, but that's why there are protocol layers. UDP, TCP, IP, UDP, HTTP, HTML etc. It's not sensible for one to try to do everything, and my point is that bitcoin can facilitate these via higher level protocols. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 22:09:20
I suggest you read a more I depth explanation. You will find I'm not wrong, and you'll hopefully learn something ;)
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:06:44
I've got a lot of mining coins so there are lots of inputs. Which makes the Bytes/fee quite low. :-(
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:14:36
To my knowledge there isn't a single useful function in Alts that isn't already possible in bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 12:00:59
You can sign shit on the blockchain and with bitcoin private keys off the blockchain. This means you can sign any string of text, including code, and confirm it either on the blockchain or via a LN transaction. This means, in turn, that bitcoin is capable of facilitating everything else. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 21:50:07
No - when you transact on LN you sign bitcoin to somebody else. The same as on-chain transactions. If you sell 100btc you have to sign a transaction. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 11:32:59
This is accurate and I realised my mistake after posting. But if every user only needs two blockchain entries that's hella better and much more scalable. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 21:22:41
No - LN transactions are bitcoin transactions, backed 1:1 by bitcoin in the blockchain. 
It's literally just a different way to transact that massively increases scalability. There's. thing fractional about it at all. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 12:49:48
Let me elaborate. It enables side chains, and side chains can have whatever rules you want. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:11:50
About fucking time. I've got a $110k transaction with $66 fee that is 30 hours unconfirmed. And a $110k transaction with $250 fee that's now 24 hours unconfirmed. Getting pretty disillusioned with the state of bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-02-02 22:11:46

Can we stop with these posts. They're too frequent and too frequently wrong. It's getting fucking boring (hodling since 2012)
@_date: 2017-01-02 20:27:36
Only 9 days (24 hour periods actually) the price traded above today's price. Nothing to do with open or close prices.
Many of those people could still have made money. 
So if you bought bitcoin on any other day, and simply held on to them, you would be in profit right now. Simple fact. 
@_date: 2016-12-29 09:48:54
Since 2012 - at the moment things are still ridiculously tame in the grand scheme of bitcoin. There are bursts of "to the moon" every few months. 
The $266, $1200 bubbles both followed a pattern of going absolutely unbelievably nuts. Both also held a pattern of settling ABOVE the previous bubbles highs. The same holds true going back to the $32 bubble.
Log scale graphs really help in judging the crazyness.
For prior history you need to look at mtgox logscale graph:

The guy is legitimately a nobody and we're giving him more attention than he's ever had.... works for him I guess.

Bitcoin is essentially instant. But not going to debate the technical aspects of this here. I understand there are caveats.

Sorry pumper, ripple is already a failed experiment. You can't convince anybody with a brain that ripple is any good. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 19:06:06
It's easy to fake transaction volumes with zero fees. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 19:30:05
If the transaction was €9000 then that's enough to move the litecoin market. It's a nothing coin. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 09:35:59
oh yeah, forgot about that reason. That was probably a good 50% of bitcoiners back then.

No, the current average fee over the last 24hours was $7 but many transactions had far lower fees. I don't pay anything else. Miners get new minted coins as reward but nobody pays for this. "We all" nothing. This is not how fees work. 
My WU fee was actually £40billion because western union costs a lot to run. No, doesn't work like that.

To conflate an organisation accepting bitcoin with that organisation having a major impact on bitcoins history is a bit absurd. And I think the libertarian mantle was well and truly earned by Ulbricht, who deved a platform to function in harmony with bitcoin, Assange merely posted a bitcoin address. 
Sorry but, Assange has as much to do with bitcoin as I have Todo with shagging sheep because I met a new zealander once. And a Welshman.

Exactly the same position as you (bought for $10) and added to the mix for me is the whole bitcoin startups stuff with ActiveMining swallowing 220btc - i did the BFL miners, and 28nm gear, etc. 
This shit isn't exciting for my any more even if the vast proportion of my wealth is still in btc. 
I just feel sorry for the eth kids about to be slapped.
