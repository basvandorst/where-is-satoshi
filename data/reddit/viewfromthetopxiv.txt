Dumbest post I have read all day. Sounds like you have too much skin in the game. Sounds best if you got out completely. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 03:28:21
No we don’t.

Bought some ETH to help balance. I’ll consider it a discounted buy!

Or short term investments? Very confused here...I am seeing this on the balance sheets of several companies...
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:44:34
Oh really? 
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:13:00
So that line on their balance sheet called long term investments is comprised of what? I can’t seem to figure that out...

You calling today an apocalypse?

No dumb questions, right? If I am in the USA does it matter if I get Trezor or Ledger? When I googled it they were priced in British Pounds?

Thanks for looking out for us.

Retirement might be coming sooner than you think :)

Is this the dip? 
@_date: 2017-08-31 23:28:33
Why is that?
@_date: 2017-08-19 02:34:55
Oh.

Are hardware wallets on extreme back order?

As far as I know, high schools still don't teach basic personal finance. We are far away from learning about blockchains.

Wish I knew what the price was going to be today. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:02:09
Yes. This is going to correct hard and fast. Be prepared.

At the same time, when was the last time anyone bought something with gold?
@_date: 2017-11-29 13:37:42
10s. Growth was slow a year ago...
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:56:08
This is so childish. Hopefully this is the last dumb thing this sub-reddit does and we can start being a meaningful resource once again.

How about blockchain.info?
@_date: 2017-10-09 22:22:52
If I moved bitcoin from blockchain.info to Breadwallet after the fork, but had my bitcoin in blockchain.info at the fork, where is my bitcoin cash now?
Can I still apply the same procedures above to extract bitcoin cash from blockchain.info?
