To someone like me who buys a little every month, now is probably a better time than last week... but next week? Who knows.
@_date: 2016-08-11 13:46:23
I use bittylicious every month for my monthly buy.
i know the rate they give isn't the best, but hot damn is it quick, easy and convenient.
Never had a bad experience with them and have put through like 30+ buys.
@_date: 2016-04-27 13:07:17
I know right, my monthly buy is planned for tomorrow, so if this climb could just chill the fuck out for 24 hours, that'd be great.
@_date: 2016-04-18 11:22:05
I think you would struggle to buy such a small amount, as transaction fees alone would probably be more.
Back in the day there were "taps" online that would give out small amounts per click or whatever, but I've not heard of any still running at this point.
I personally get my monthly BTC from bittylicious, it's not the cheapest way but i've had nothing but successful transactions with them and find it quick easy and convenient.
i tend to buy £10, or £20 or £30 at a time, so they do deal with smaller transactions. Not sure about as small as you want though.

@_date: 2016-04-18 11:56:54
Ah, bummer.
Might be worth googling around for some bitcoin "taps" or bitcoin "faucets" they let users claim tiny amounts of BTC every 24 hours for filling in captcha things. 
Like i say not sure if many are still running, but a lucky click on one might just give you the amount you're after.
@_date: 2016-04-18 11:10:21
Personally i'd do a low value buy, like $10.00 or whatever, and add on the amount i need to round out my balance too.

I've been dumping a small amount into bitcoin each month growing a nice supply.
I've got a Mastercard (from ecoin) onto which i can load bitcoin and spend GBP. I've been buying food, fuel, shopping, practically anything, essentially with bitcoin, without the retailer even knowing bitcoin is involved.
Shit is mainstream.

Depends which event you're referring to.
When the American Neo-Liberal's and their pals the Chicago boys shocked Chile into capitalism and installed Pinochet, he killed tens of thousands, tortured many more and "dissapeared" (read left on the roadside with single bullet wound to the head as a warning to others) thousands more, pretty much anyone who was a political opponent. Not to mention the 200,000 odd that simply fled.
All in the name of forcing neo-liberal capitalism onto the Nation.
Despite killing and dissapearing his opponenets, the people rose up and it only lasted 10 years before they regained some form of democracy, but their entire economy and social structure was ruined forever.
Or maybe Iraq? Where they're still trying to figure out how many people were killed in the attempt to turn Iraq into "the Dubai or Singapore of the Middle East." (ie, a friendly, market based economy open to foreign investment)
Let alone the enormous economic damage and pain and sufferring from having their National wealth wiped out paying American companies to kinda rebuild the place, with imported labour and materials at extortionate prices. (those cost + contracts allow American company's to charge the American tax payer, and the host Nation "whatever it costs, plus profit."
(Wait, we're broke? We need Austerity? And you paid Haliburton HOW MUCH to partially, and badly rebuild iraq in a failed experiment?) - hint it was in the region of $20bn to Haliburton.
Or perhaps the economic failure caused by forcing Gorbachev out and replacing him with Yeltsin as a frontman to force Chicago boys style capitalism onto the Russian people? Or is it the sufferring the Russian people still feel today at the Mafia capitalism we left them with?
Hell, at least those Countries kept their pain and sufferring to themselves. They didn't go on a highly profitable tour of the World trying to kill and intimidate their economic plans onto everyone else.
Or are you talking about the actual American people? those who die because they can't afford healthcare? Or the huge portion of a specific racial group imprisoned for profit? Or the way that economics in the USA are failing right now, banks too big to fail, completely out of control inequality, rapid destruction of our planet (for profit) and a complete and utter lack of real democracy?
I'm not sure which thing you're referring to.
From where I'm standing, a reasonable understanding of economics, a half decent knowledge of history and managaing to avoid the American neo-liberal indoctrination as much as possible, kinda make the American neo-liberals look like one of the worst evils this World has ever seen.
At least Hitler kept his focus on specific groups, and at least Saddam kept his brutality to his own people, seems American neo-liberals will destroy anyone who gets in their way no matter what race, colour or creed they are, well, they'll help someone else to do it, save getting their own hands dirty, keep that facade up, and will literally brain wash the children at home, via every possible channel, almost a bombardment to overload the senses, to think they're the good guys and their way is the only way.
Thought Obama would be an end to it. But turns out he's just another pointless face in the sham democracy they fool the American people so well with.
Maybe secure some "freedom" at home, before forcing, militarily, your kind of "freedom" on other Nations eh.

So you get $0.35 tip, and you make a post on and get a couple more little tips.
Now you've got a dollar or so in your changetip account, so you get a wallet and send it there.
(In all honesty, who can really be bothered to learn about and setup a wallet for that $0.35 changetip balance?)
You watch it grow a little, read and learn more about BTC, and start changing fiat into BTC, just a little, just for fun.
Before you know it, you've traded in your old games consoles and phones for BTC, bought take aways and a memory card with your BTC and you're kind of a legitimate user securing it's future as a relevant currency, a tiny bit at a time, with each transaction you make.
You feel you can afford to chop a couple of dollars out of your wallet to use for tips... The cycle continues and the currency grows.
The main thing that personally got me fully involved, was discussing BTC right here in this sub, and some kind stranger decided to double my BTC wallet, I only had maybe $5-6 in there, but a redditor turned it into $10-12 and I felt compelled to add to it from there on.
I don't mind if you post here fishing for tips, just make sure that sooner or later you pass them on, and avoid using BTc like some kind of pump and dump stock.
Exchange it, earn it, spend it, tip it, donate it, buy it, hodl it, whatever.
Just use it.

I'm a totaly layman when it comes to this stuff... just like most of the public. I have a rough understanding of how bitcoin works, and I kinda collect it.
I've never heard of Stellar before you mentioned it and I don't know what a "Facebook auth" is. 
Yet I just had goods delivered that I bought with 0.2 BTC it was quick, it was easy and it was kinda really cool to send money from my phone to a company via a QR code.
I'm pretty sure Bitcoin, with all it's news coverage and public figures speaking about or using it, with all it's merchants accepting it and sources to buy it from, will be far easier to sell the public on than introducing yet another weird internet money thing that has some kind of link to facebook or something??
@_date: 2014-07-09 11:20:45

Not trying to bag on you at all, but I don't see how this can be a revalation to so many people.
"The Free Market" sounds all warm and fuzzy and "free" but it essentially means "Make as much fucking money as possible at all costs no matter who or what it harms or destroys"
If it stands to make us money, support it. If it stands to cost us money, destroy it.
The Free Market is not about you being free to choose products, as says the fairy tale they've fed us for generations. It's about businesses being "free" to exploit both it's employees and it's customers at every possible opportunity.
@_date: 2014-07-31 09:24:17

Don't send me any, I just wanted to say, this is how I started,  someone tipped me some bits.

I think the downvotes are because you're clearly in it to make a profit.
Personally I just want to already have some BTC when the banking industry implodes, again.
I spend it knowing that i'm paying more in the longrun, or that that take away could be worth $1000s in a year or so, just to support it.

Lol.  Almost. Almost. Luckily I checked it pretty carefully and noticed right away.

Usually US intervention.
Be it Nixon "making Chile's economy Scream" - He actually gave that order, then eventually supported, and backed Pinochet's violent, torturous, illegal and anti-democratic coup.
Or something simple like Cuba's trade embargo.
Almost like Capitalist states really didn't want socialist democracies to work for some wierd reason.
"History is written by the victor" Everything you learned in school and out, was built on the basis that Friedman was right and Free Market Capitalism works.
The experiment in reality should have come to an end a few times, but you tell everyone it's the most important thing from an early age, discredit any other options, and they'll support you while you keep resuscitating the broken economic plan till it's no longer an experiment and people just don't know any different.

UK here too, I've been trading my old games, consoles (PS3) and mobile, to webuy dot com for BTC.

I made a couple of BTc transactions over the weekend.
the one and only point where it wasn't lovely and simple, was where the take away asked for 0.02125 BTC and I had my phone wallet set up for bits, almost sent them £380 instead of £38. lol.
A smaller, standard denomination is much needed.
@_date: 2014-08-07 08:32:00
I personally stick with BTc because i feel it has the highest chance of public acceptance.
Having the public accept any "one of those wierd internet money things" is tough, having them accept "THE internet currency" is far easier.
All these altcoins just muddy the issue of crypto's becoming widely accepted and kind of skew the issue of BTC being finite. "If it's finite, why not just create a new one?"
I dunno. I just dislike the idea of all these different cryptos, I mean it's good to have lots of people working on improvements which can be fed into BTC, but it certainly hurts the public image of cryptos.

@_date: 2014-02-21 12:46:00
I grab about £20 worth of BTC each time i get paid, like 1% of my income.
Some months it buys me a little BTC, others it buys me much more, but it all adds up.
I'm just collecting it to use as currency as soon as I can, if that means one day i can order a £10 pizza for BTC I paid £1 for well that's a bonus!
I'm looking forward to this months buy as obviously the price hasn't been so low for a long time, I should get a nice BTC injection!
@_date: 2014-08-07 22:26:02
Oh no, I don't have overdraft protection, hell no.
These are "unarranged overdraft fees" Neither the bank nor myself arranged the overdraft, but I'm the one who has to pay!
And "Payment referral fees" for deciding if 70p is enough money to pay a £10 bill. Apparently it is, and luckily for the bank that puts the account into a state where they can charge the £5 per day unarranged overdraft fee.
It's a fucking massive scam.
In my run in mentioned above, I actually, after them closing, and me reopening a complaint 3 times, and bringing in the financial ombudsman, got it all refunded, plus a good will apology payment. However it took some serious work on my part not to end up paying at least 20x the original bill, because the bank's system is designed to fuck customers over.

I live in the UK, and collect BTC for fun, never really expecting it to take off over here properly.
This weekend I sold my PS3 and some games to webuy.com for BTC.
To celebrate I ordered an Indian take away from takeaway.com and paid with BTC.
BTC was the perfect currency to use for both transactions, made it super easy.
I used to work at an online guitar shop. One time we had a stack of customer orders, with CC numbers, expiry datesa and security (is it CVC? or Cv2? something like that) written on them in black marker, along with name, address, pretty much everything you need....
That stack got dropped by accident, by a drunk colleague, into someone's box, which we then shipped out to them.
Neither of the companies i dealt with this weekend have any useful financial information on me, nor access to any of my money.

I think the opposite of this, I feel that in the near future, possibly within our lifetime, humanity will have an existential crisis.
With billions of humans being born into poverty, and not enough resources for all combined with our current "competitionist" culture, I belive will create a World of violence and war over what we consider basic resources like food and water.
When society collapses (as many others have at around this point in their progression) and regular money becomes irrellivant, those of us who hold stock in a ready-to-go alternative will be in a really good position.
TL;DR I'm collecting and holding BTC to capitalise on the downfall of Western, if not all, society.

Since the unions, and the very idea of unions were literally killed in the 70's, no, the employees have no say in the matter.
They have the option to work under the conditions imposed, or not to. Combined with the terrible treatment of the poor, it's a pretty easy decision, even if it's anything but "free."
In parts of the market, usually luxury goods, sure we can choose to buy or not buy a product.
But what about utilities? Or housing? Food and healthcare? We need these things to live, so do we just find the supplier we least disagree with?
I agree though, my problem is corporatism, (you bought up capitalism) and the fundamentalist, extremist support of what they call the "free market."
I'm all for a more moderate support of the free market. I'm just against free market extremism.

No they don't.
Not if they went through the Propoga.... I mean school system.
They were taught, "haha look at Russia, communism doesn't work. (just totally ignore what happened when we tried to shock them, and many Nations into capitalism, we've nearly got that experiment working, look at Iraq! Almost worked! Well, worked much better than Russia or Chile!)"
"Capitalism, specifically this extremist version of "free market" capitalism works perfectly and is the only possible way for anyone, ever, anywhere to live. It's also somehow synonymous with democracy. Democracy is about giving you the freedom to buy what you want, not the freedom to live a fulfilling life, silly.
Success is measured by bank balance, life isn't fair, being rich will make you happy and is the only way to acheive that, and if you're struggling you're just not working hard enough. Also, if you think it's unfair that some people are born rich and others struggle their whole lives, then you're a filthy communist who doesn't want hard working people to keep their hard earned (or inherited) money."
Add in some, "Socialism is communism" and a sprinkle of "Friedman's economics is only economics" with a drop of "Keynesian economics doesn't work" and bam, you've got yourself a seriously fucked up system that will fuck it's self until it's got no fucks left, borrow some fucks from it's slave masters to fuck it's self some more. All while defending it's right to fuck it's self and celebrating whoever fucks themselves the hardest.
Ideally we would find a nice, moderate middle ground between Friedman and Keynes, and Laissez-faire and socialism. Pick the best parts of each and create something new.
But instead we have extremists on one side wanting the  most extreme version of their preference and pointing out how the most extreme, or not technically "by the book" version of the other side didn't work (specially after some serious sabotage in the case of Socialist democracies and military coups)
The problem we have in the 21st century, is that the people benefitting most from the economic system, are the people who decide how to manage that economic system. Not only that but we only really have one option to vote for too. You can vote to continue the current experiment under a guy in a blue tie, or continue the current experiement under a guy in a red tie.
TL;DR we're fucked.

I think with you only betting against each other and not a "house" kind of figure, and with the organizers taking a cut, there's not much to be gained.

When I have a payment due and not enough money in my bank account, the payment still goes out, and the bank charges me £25 to make the payment, plus £5 a day until I clear the unrequested debt.
Earlier this year my bank did this for an old, cancelled payment, put me £9 overdrawn and had added £200+ in fees and charges before i even noticed this old, unused account had even had any activity. (I get monthly emails asking to check my statement, but it's had 70p left in there for over a year and all payments were supposedly cancelled).
Let me know if I've got the wrong end of the stick here, but if I was making my payments in BTC it would be impossible for this to happen, right?
All i want is for payments to be rejected if there's not enough money in the account, this seems impossible with regular current acocunts though as they all include "buffers" and other unrequested overdraft facilities.
I think there are benefits to using BTc in the UK.

Yup. At perpetual war with weaker nations for my entire lifetime (31), champions the "winners make money and losers are poor" narrative while allowing it's entire political class to be controlled by corporate influence. Imprisoning 1/3 of an entire ethnic minority in for-profit prisons, exploiting the sick in a private healthcare system, enforcing a taxation rate that sees millionaires paying a smaller percentage of their income into the system than the people who clean their offices.
I see the USA as one of the most dangerous and damging forces for evil on the planet, and it exports this culture across the globe in a bright, shiny marketing package, while ignoring the enormous, fundamental problems it causes.
You know when you watch Star Wars, and you see the Empire and understand they're the bad guys, do you think the people and the society they're out "protecting" actually believe they're run by the "bad guys?" you know the evil the Empire do is all in the name of keeping their society safe and protected.
The USA is exactly the same, a formidable military force, who crushes ideology that opposes their own, uses war, exploitation and imprisonment to maintain it's economy and to keep it's military strong to continue the cycle.
It's like a religious extremist Nation, only the God it serves is Capitalism.
Sure capitalism isn't all bad, when controlled, when regulated, when maintained, when used for the good of the public, as it was a couple of generations ago, but by using wealth as a metric for success, we handed control of the economy over to those who benefit most from it, which in turn turned it into a tool for exploitation. If you allow the lunatics to take control of the asylum you start to think that the normal people are crazy.
I don't want some hard left communist world, i don't want the USA to turn into Venezuela, but this idea that hard right politics is moderate, and anything else is crazy, is absolutely borked, and is making a mockery of democracy.
American democracy was lost once the Establishment took control of the media and with it dictated the position of the overton window.
Break up the big banking groups, impose controls and restrictions on monopolies and media groups, enforce some kind of wealth distribution model that doesn't see stagnated living standards for workers funding unimaginable wealth gains for the rich.
Hardly turning the USA into Venezuela, just making it a bit more fair, reigniting the chances of normal people living the American dream, rather than spending their lives fighting against their employers and those who hold their surival to ransom for profit.
Humans are a social species, we work in communities and societies, we need a system built upon this ideal, rather than one that pits us all against one another in a race to accrue the most shiny things. A race in which the role of moderator has been assumed by the winners, who in turn have skewed the rules to ensure they always remain winners.
TL;DR: The USA is the real World fucking Sith Empire.

I've been.... now I'm not sure of the right verb here, "using" i suppose, Bitcoin for a couple of years now.
I didn't get in early enough to really win on it's big climb, but I bought in, in a small amount, when it was about $200 odd per coin, maybe a little lower I forget.
I keep like 10% of my monthly income in bitcoin, i use it to buy videogames and take aways when I run out of fiat, and i sell my old videogames and other tech (phones, consoles tablets etc) for Bitcoin to webuy dot com. If my wallet is looking low i'll buy some to top it off.
It's just nice to have a seperate currency to use for that kind of stuff and i like the novelty of how paying works. lol.
I don't know if i'm a typical bitcoin user or not, but all this huff and puff and sensationalist headlines mean nothing to me.
I use bitcoin because it's the main crypto, and i think crypto is a good idea that i want to support. I'm not about to go "branching" into one of the many other cryptos when BTC suits me perfectly.
@_date: 2016-06-17 10:56:35
This is the key issue.
Some of us want a nice stable currency to use (the fact that the Kebab i bought on Monday cost me BTC that would have been worth 15-20% more today is not a good thing) while others seem to wantto buy in, watch it grow and cash out.
This seems to be the issue with a lot of wealthy, investor types. They don't like it cause it's too volatile. Last wealthy investor type i spoke to said: "BTC's going to cause a lot of tears" and "If you don't understand it, stay away from it."
They're looking at it as an investment, rather than a currency.
We saw it shoot up to $1000 in the recent past. Then drop back down to $400.
This spike to $700 isn't really all that newsworthy. i'm more interested in where it's going to land when it comes back down. Where the new normal is.

ITT Lots of folks who don't seem to realise than laissez faire neoliberal capitalism makes people starve too.
I'd blame this more on basing your entire economy on oil, than on socialism. I mean did anyone else notice that oil now costs half what it used to? 
Surely any Country, socialist, capitalist, whatever, who has an economy so hugely reliant on one single commodity, would go into meltdown if that commodity lost 50% of it's value?
I mean, if everyone on Earth stopped killing each other, the USA's and UK's arms export business would completely fall apart shedding a huge portion of GDP.
But oh no, in "all or nothing, black or white, good guys and bad guys" American culture, the idea of a compromise, or blend, or balance between socialism and laissez faire neo liberal capitalism isn't even an option, "oh look a socialist country is in trouble, guess that means we're the winners. lol" 
Ignore those people eating rats in tent cities, ignore those people bankrupted by cancer, ignore the wealthy avoiding their contributions to society, ignore the homeless living outside unoccupied houses, ignore the working poor, ignore the creeping authoritarian state, happy to regulate the public while allowing commerce to run wild, ignore the outrageous inequality gap... no everything is brilliant in the neoliberal laissez faire world, eveything is fine, cause i've got food, and someone else has a mega yacht, it's all fine if you ignore the bad sides!
The self attribution fallacy, allows me to blame those people for their suffering, and let's our greedy, selfish ideology off the fucking hook.

Lego Jurassic World PS4 game for my son with BTC from webuy dot com.
Some PSN credit for myself.
And I sold / liquidated about 0.3 BTC to cover the fuel required to take my wife and kids to Wales for the weekend.
Ideally I wouldn't have had to sell at this kinda price, but cashflow eh.
I'm hoping the cost keeps low, so even though i sold low, when I get paid on Friday I can buy even lower.
If not, eh, i'm buying anyway, it's like a pay day ritual.
@_date: 2015-08-25 15:08:31

The UK government has been reducing the debt to GDP ratio, not the debt it's self.
They've been reducing it, by bumping up the GDP figures with everything they can find, including theoretical drug and prostitution spending.
They estimated that they would borrow £20bn this coming year, and have revised that figure to £69bn. I'm intrigued as to how that could constitute paying down debt?

I had an account awaiting activation, activated, and transferred the $17 to get a physical card.
By the time my transfer went through my $17 was only worth $16.99, so I sent another 3c.
By the time THAT went through my initial transfer was worth $16.96, so when the 3c landed i was still at $16.99.
So i sent like $20 worth to my account and hopefully I can use whatever is left to top up my card.

"self made" is an interesting description of someone who claims billions of pounds of state support in the form of corporate subsidies.
edit: But I get it, championing him as "self made" helps to convince everyone that "hey, you can do it too!" and keeps everyone feeling like [temporarily embarrassed millionaires.](
Edit: Doesn't really sound like the actions of a ["self made man"](
"Let's deal with the open-air subsidies first. If you tot up all the direct subsidies Branson's west coast mainline service received between 1997 and 2012, and convert them to today's prices, you get a sum of £2.79bn handed over by us – before a single ticket has been sold. And it is certainly before you factor in the service's upgrade (worth around £9bn, and paid for by the public), and the fleet of Pendolino trains (again, largely subsidised by the government)."
He's as much a "self made man" as a benefit theif is a "contributory member of society."

To be fair though, there have been a few situations in recent memory, where if you got more than a few thousand dollars worth of bitcoin, and didn't manage to change it to fiat in time it could have lost a lot of value.
I think it's just the riskiness and volatility that keeps businesses away.

I think the important thing to keep in mind, is that it's not an investment. It's not a tool to make money.
It's a currency, if you think of it as one, and use it as one, it's simply a currency that can be more easily transferred and moved around than other currencies.
As soon as you're in it to "make gains" you've abandoned the point of it, and have become somewhat of an abuser of it.
I'm in the UK, and the other day, in seconds, a stranger from Argentina sent me 0.04 BTC for a digital download code. Within seconds of me giving him my address, my phone went "cha-ching" and I sent him the code, no 3rd party, bank or authority involved, from him to me.

I was thinking about this at lunch, and I worked out that my car is currently worth about 11 BTC.
It is not a flashy beemer, rather an old workhorse.

I think it's down to much more than just them being idiots.
Perhaps, living a life whereby you have little to no satisfaction, very little to look forward to, literally working to earn your poverty, you feel you deserve better, or at least something, and credit offers you that.
Just like drink and smoking, and drugs, we all know that they're bad for us, and we all know they're not a good decision to make, but for many people they're the only real chance at satisfaction that they can get.
Combine, a workforce where all the hard, but rewarding production jobs have been eaten by technology, leaving only short term, temporary, service type jobs, a complete lack of any feeling of value to your life. You're not a valued human resource with experience and skill, part of a tight nit workplace community, you're a disposable robot in the robot farm, waiting to go home along with all the other robots.
..with, a consumerist system, extremely high levels of emotional, phsychological marketing and advertising at every possible opportunity. A media controlled mindset and genuine belief that expensive products will make you happy.
...and a banking system which profits on debt, and is encouraged to lend by the government.
...and it's incredibly easy to see why people would over spend on credit, buying the things that the TV tells them all day long, in such emotive ways, will make them happier, because there's an enormous defecit of actual genuine happiness, value and satisfaction in their lives.
It's easy to say that idiots overspend and run up too much credit, and in doing so we're simply ignoring the problem and attributing it to idiots.
Those "idiots" make up a huge proportion of the Worlds people, businesses, and Nations.

Be it religion, politics, profit, or simply the result of propaganda, all and any reason why another person should not use a natural herb for recreational enjoyment, is a bullshit reason.
I just wish we could keep our noses out of other people's business.
What drugs you use, your sexual preference, who you want to marry, all things we waste so much political time on, send decades arguing about, when really, the bottom line is, if it's not hurting anyone, or even if it's only hurting those who choose to do it, leave it the fuck alone.

Of course, because you don't want people linking your name to a company in Panama that consists of a mail box.
That's the kicker for me in all these Panama stories, if you can justify that the off shore company is a genuine, operating company, with assets in that country, then fine.
But if it's a "shell company" then you can eat a dick. Pay your fucking taxes.

Check out bittylicious. Chose how much you want, confirm the deal, served a bank transfer with a specific reference, and btc lands in your wallet a few minutes later.
@_date: 2015-02-16 10:51:09
Correct me if I'm wrong, but doesn't storing your digital cash in a third party exchange defeat the entire point of bitcoin?

I'm in my 30's, full time decent office job, Mortgage, BMW, 2 kids, wife, cat.
I've got about half a bitcoin so far. Finding enough to buy a whole bitcoin after paying all my families bills and living expenses is difficult.
I grab maybe £20 worth each month, and spend some here and there too.
In fact I **had** about half a bitcoin, but spent like 0.2BTC on a takeaway over the weekend.
I **could** afford more, hell I could grab a whole coin now if i wanted to, but "don't invest more than you can afford to lose."
Struggling to find money you can afford to lose in the midst of a global recession, with stagnant wages and inflated living costs, does not a 12 year old make.
Edit: just spent most of my btc on a video game... Maybe I am 12 after all. Haha.

Indeed. However as we peel through this onion we then find that the laws imposed by the government were actually written by folks who, do, did or will work for those lenders.
If you were asked to write a rule for your next employer, I think something along the lines of "make loads of risky money and if you fuck up we'll cover your ass" would be a popular choice.
This place is some kinda fucked up.
@_date: 2015-02-19 14:19:20
I use bittylicious, it's not the cheapest, but I can grab £20 or £30 worth in a few minutes using a back transfer.

LOL. Brexit hasn't even begun yet.
1) Article 50
2) 2 years + of negotiations
3) Official Brexit
The economy has bounced back, from the initial shock to speculation caused by the referendum result. The actual effects of Brexit will not be seen or known until at least 2018.

Who would have thought that continuing in the same way we did before the crisis, could lead to another crisis?
Oh no it's OK, we forced austerity onto the people and gave all the money to the banks. 
That'll fix the credit crisis!!

But behind every reckless borrower, is a reckless lender. It's a two way deal, and the current mindset of "well you shouldn't have borrowed it" ignoring the "well they shouldn't have lent you it" is doing the whole situation a disservice.
This is on an international level as well, we see a lot of reports about Greece not wanting to pay back it's debts, but never a mention about how we probably shouldn't have forced them to borrow so much...

Originally I did the whole buy via mobile bill, pay nearly 100% in fees thing.
So my £5 worth actuall cost closer to £10. (I really wanted to grab some while it was low, more for the novelty than the value).
Although I found a site called bittylicious?? or something like that which i'm going to try when i get paid, set up an account and it looks promising.
@_date: 2013-11-25 11:16:25

Gutted mate.
I'm on Android, but I make a copy of my encrypted wallet backup from my phone and keep one on a USB stick, and one on my PC.
I tend to make a fresh backup after any large buys, just in case.
A few times I've updated firmware, or once factory reset my phone without thinking, and luckily a quick copy from my PC or USB stick and my wallet is back as it was.

Hey Bitcoin, if you could just stop rising for a couple of days so I can buy up some of your lovely bits to add to my small collection when I get paid on Friday, that'd be great.
@_date: 2013-11-18 14:52:54
Same happened to me! Someone here tipped me $1. Then I thought i'd add to it and figure out how to buy BTC, bought another £3 worth.
Watched that grow to £6 worth, mentioned it on here and another awesome internet stranger tipped me £6 worth, doubling my investment just because they could!
So i had 0.04BTC which was £12 worth, which is now worth £17 thanks to the rising value.
BTC is fucking awesome right now!
@_date: 2013-11-29 12:57:16
If that's what's important to you, you enjoy it buddy!
Personally, i have a lot of things to juggle in my life, gaming at the highest possible resolution comes after job performance, family happiness, sex life, how my car is running, etc etc etc.
You can't have the very best of everything, you have to sacrifice some things for others. So rather than an awesome high res game playing PC, I've got a happy family, decent job, satisfied wife, healthy kids, a fast car, and a PS4.
I'm happy with my setup. i hope you're happy with yours too.
much love.
@_date: 2013-11-25 11:09:01
You're full of helpful tips ain'tcha!
Hahaha, seriously, thanks, you may have just solved my monthly buying issue for me.
If I had more than 0.04BTC i'd tip you some!
@_date: 2013-11-14 15:38:49
I'm new to this so excuse my stupidity, but how did you turn 0.1 into 3.2?

@_date: 2013-11-29 12:07:19
Why's that?
I'd say anyone smart enough to buy bitcoin is smart enough to know that PC gaming is far more hassle than it's worth, and that the ease, simplicity and reliability of console gaming is more than worth a tiny drop in graphical fidelity.
Take that PC master race shit back to thanks.
Also, anyone smart enough to buy BTC is smart enough to understand the phrase "horses, for courses"
@_date: 2013-11-25 11:01:09
Awesome thank you!!
@_date: 2013-11-29 12:34:44
Excellent! Thanks.
I shall keep an eye on it and get collecting up some BTC!
@_date: 2013-11-27 11:10:44
Sure the BTC "would be" worth $10k but at the time they actually acquired the coins they were probably either mined or bought a super low value.
So on one hand it's a $10k pizza, on the other it's a $0 (or at least very little) pizza.
Kinda like a modern glass half full situation.
@_date: 2013-11-14 14:25:43
I'm a bigtime investor too, bought 0.02 bitcoins a while back for like £3, they're now worth £7.
Massive returns!
I wish i had money to invest properly :( Although it's fun to get involved and watch the situation without any real money riding on it.

I'm in the UK, and I'd love to collect BTC for a few months and eventually spend it on a holiday in that lovely cottage!
So yes. Accept BTC! I'll pay!
I had a quick look at it on the site, but didn't see any pricing? Any info on pricing? So i know how much BTC to accrue between now and summer?

Oh man, being unemployed must suck, but hey at least you have time to read those system requirements, upgrade that hardware and hunt out that incompatibility!
I get most of my games from ps+ and buy only a couple a year.
When you get yourself a job you'll realise that time is actually more valuable than money.
@_date: 2013-11-27 17:30:50
See I'm already on the "want some bitcoins" side of the fence, but with it as volatile as it is, and being in no rush to get them, keeping an eye out for a low point doesn't hurt.
I'm only doing it for fun, with tiny amounts of money.
@_date: 2013-12-03 12:01:31
That's amazing.
Just last week I had to fuck around with poor exchange rates and timed bank transfers.
That escalated quickly!
@_date: 2013-11-29 12:32:52
I won a £1000 PC in a competition 3 years ago - it sucks balls at gaming and can barely run the latest Civ game.
So I don't use it for games.
I haven't got space for fucking tower blocks, and monitors and keyboards and mousemats.
I do have however, a PS4 arriving today which will sit nicely under my TV and play any game labelled "PS4" without having to check requirements and upgrade anything, without any worry that i'll get it home and some incompatibility somewhere will stop it from working.
For a nerd, living in a basement, with the time to fuck around and the money to spend on upgrades i'm sure PC's are awesome. For a Dad, with a mortgage, and a family to spend time with / feed etc being able to just sit down in the living room, on a sofa, and play, everytime, without spending any time dicking about with the guts of my gaming machine, console gaming is by far the best option.
Would you kindly stop following me around reddit trolling all my unrelated comments? Is that the kind of thing a PC gamer has time to do??? Wow.
@_date: 2013-11-25 18:16:57
The tip bot makes you like a reddit wallet, from which you can forward btc to your own wallet.
It's pretty nice.

Cool! Good to know! thanks.
@_date: 2013-11-25 09:23:21
It's how i got started, someone tipped me $1 worth of BTC, encourgaing me to create a wallet, which looked a bit lonely, so i added £5 worth myself.
...which is now worth £23!
From now on i'm going to be buying a little BTC every time i get paid, just so that when i can spend it in shops around here I've got some to try it out with!
Can't wait.
Viva la revolution!
@_date: 2013-11-27 10:58:24
As a person who considered investing at £15, but didn't bother, then jumped in at £150 and watched my tiny investment grow rapidly - DO IT NOW. (or at least next time it dips a little).
@_date: 2013-11-20 13:06:00
I just want to collect BTC at low values for (hopefully) spending on "stuff" in the future.
Does it make me part of the problem that I buy when it dips low?
Right now I'm only buying tiny amounts, but I'm going to start putting some cash aside each payday to grab BTC at it's lower points through the month.
I don't want to get rich off of it, i just want to spend £1 on BTC and buy a £5 Lunch with it when the value gets back up.
Is that bad?
