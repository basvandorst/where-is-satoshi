Yup... Actually the Jiaozi, the first Chinese paper currency ever to exist, while "backed by gold" couldn't be redeemed / converted back into gold / silver / silk.  That one failed, but not before the obligatory high inflation.  Yuan Dynasty also have "bank notes", but they also failed.  
Something about paper money and failing.  Seems to be a theme here.

Sadly you're being down voted, but your are correct.  The "unbacked" paper money will be the downfall.  So yes, they were right the whole time.

Actually with a caveat though.  Every single society that tried to diminish their currency through inflation failed.  
Paper can be printed, the Ming Dynasty banned paper money.  Even though it was "backed" by gold/silver/silk, it could always be printed and lied about.
Rome, used Denarius.  Silver and gold coins.  It wasn't until they started adding impurities to the silver to "stretch" how many coins were made (inflating the currency) did inflation occur (more coins to equal the same amount of silver) and the fall eventually happen. 
It always fell with the politicians thought they knew better, thought the people were stupid, and figured they could get away with it.
Even our constitution even states that debts must only be redeemable in silver or gold.  (Article 1, section 10)  
But somewhere along the line even we lost our way.  We got off the gold standard only in 1971, and that's when the real inflation occurred.
But don't take some random dudes word for it on the internet.  Look it all up and you'll see it's all true and the fact that very very few people know any of this is why were doomed to repeat history... all over again.
