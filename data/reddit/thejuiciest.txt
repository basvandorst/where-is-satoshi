I don't have any Bitcoin cash. I have Bitcoin and Litecoin. You can call it whatever you want. I was just explaining why some people don't like the word Bcash. I don't really care what you call it.

I have no fucking Bitcoin Cash. I've said this already.

You know flogging is bad right?

Where did you get the idea I like Bitcoin Cash? My point is if you fuck with their name they'll fuck with yours. 6 letters don't take that long to type.

My point was that they will mess with your name if you mess with theirs. If you call it Bcash they will call Bitcoin Bitcoin core.

I didn't get my Bitcoin until after the fork.
@_date: 2018-01-16 03:40:50
That makes sense.

This statement is quite hypocritical. You are ok with calling Bitcoin cash Bcash but not the reverse. If you want Bitcoin to be called Bitcoin, then call Bitcoin Cash Bitcoin Cash.

Oh I see.
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:54:46
I've never heard of it used that way.

This shit is really sketchy. But is bitcoin cash  itself worse, or is it just the behind the scenes stuff that's bad? I'm just curious.

So antbleed allows bitmain to shut of asic miners?
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:02:15
So they could cripple Bitcoin by disabling BTC miners?
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:05:26
Oh. Good. But they were trying to do that?

I've never used it. Sorry.

The coinbase wallet isn't really a wallet. Your private keys are stored in coinbase servers rather than on your device.
