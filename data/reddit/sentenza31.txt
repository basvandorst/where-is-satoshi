I agree with you i am pro segwit, and i dont support bitcoin cash at all. But i have to say bitcoin will die if nothing happen.
Myself i have a website or you pay 50$ in btc only, i loose customer beacause of fee, we are working to propose LTC payment.....
Why we dont increase block size now we have segwit ?

The people behind was a problem for me too.
And as a dev myself i see the benefit of segwit to optimize the network, but it's not incompatible with block size increase

This ! You have made mistake but the altcoin will rise after BTC rally pause.

I really want LN, i was not aware some guy bitching about LN.
I look forward to have some kind of debit card for BTC, and leave my bank. Small stack on LN channel (centralization is bad i know) and the rest on main blockchain.

Unpopular opinion, I think it has some part right.
I am a true bitcoin believer ... but volatility kills the initiative buisness, I accept bitcoin on my small site, most of my payments are from December, I did not convert to fiat, I let you imagine how much money I lose .. Hoppefully i  do not need this money. Imagine a real business in this situation.
Steam stop bitcoin payment for the same reason.
What to do ? I do not know, I do not want centralization, maybe Bitcoin needs more liquidity.
But clearly, we will not use Bitcoin every day in the current situation.
I know that I will be crucified for saying this: D
Do we want a currency who free people, or ponzy schema ?

If I still need fiat what the point of btc

When bitcoin is in bull run, nobody wants to spend it, its a problem too.
