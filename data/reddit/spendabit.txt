What people say they want is often very different from what they ask (or vote) for. And in this case, people may be more angry about the fact the guy "hiding" money was an agent of the state (a *head* of state/government no less) than they are about the fact he was hiding money -- that he's a hypocrite and lives by different rules than the 'commoners'.

As the [OP points out]( the Bitcoin payment option that comes with this tool is probably useless at this point in time...

That's only half of the problem. True, perhaps, if *everyone* knew about the possibilities cryptography provides, the public pressure would bring it to adoption. But the current system is thoroughly convenient for the "PTB", so they not only wish to preserve the thoroughly corrupt system (voting and the rest of it) but also (we can be sure) want to make sure people *don't even know* there's the possibility of something better.

Yes, you're right (as far as I understand) -- coins moved to RSK that get hacked/stolen over there would affect the overall BTC ecosystem. However, it would not (directly) affect those that were conservative and chose not to use RSK; they would not lose funds (though you could argue they would be indirectly affected).
Contrast that with Ethereum, where a heist led to a full-blown currency/block-chain fork, and to this day we have two distinct "Ethereums".

My hope is we can use the analogy of "checking" versus "savings" accounts to teach people how to use LN... If the answer to your question is in the affirmative, then presumably the analogy will work.

I didn't say Bitcoin was stable (yet), but it has a longer track-record than Ethereum.
EDIT: Also, if contracts are hacked on Rootstock, it won't affect the heart of the currency/monetary system. I expect bugs and 'hacks' will occur, but it'll happen on a separate blockchain altogether.
@_date: 2017-12-02 02:57:46
It is bad 'economics', but I think his (presumed) point is still valid... The same sort of simpleton reasoning is used to show why "Bitcoin's a bubble" (and I am _not_ saying we aren't in another short-term/medium-term/long-term Bitcoin 'bubble').
@_date: 2017-12-04 17:04:33

First, you're putting words in my mouth... But since I do maintain that a society without institutionalized violence (i.e., without a 'State') is "an ideal" let's run with it.
More to your point, one of the biggest problems we see today is fascism -- corporations and (so called) 'government' buddying up. The money-and-banking system is likely the worst example of this scam, and, as is the case in virtually every example of corporations "abusing their power" I have seen, these abuses are allowed to occur, and even become institutionalized (ultra-low interest rates / free money for the banks being a recent example), because "the government" gives a green light to the abuses.
Abuses surely occur, but [they are magnified 100-fold]( when done, or aided, by 'governments'.

I suspect what you really want to know is, "why prefer a smart-contract platform that's Bitcoin-based rather than Ethereum". If so, I think the answer is (essentially) because Bitcoin is a more proven system that puts security, reliability, scalability, and decentralization ahead of shiny new features.
IMHO, Ethereum puts the cart (sophisticated contracts) before the horse (stable monetary unit)... You need a stable currency before complex contracts are of much use. By example, imagine Venezuela trying to solve their problems by reforming their contract law, whilst their currency continues to hyperinflate. (Not to say Ethereum is as corrupt or stupid as the Venezuelan elite.)

Your assumption is that jacking up the block-size does not "place the future of [the] network" into harm's way. suggested a hard-fork block-size increase for "the meantime".
The block-size has to go up (but hopefully not too much, too quickly), and the Lightning Network (or similar "layer 2" tech) is necessary if Bitcoin is ever to scale to compete with other global payment networks -- regardless of how big we make the blocks (because, as even the biggest proponents of big blocks will admit, blocks can only be so large -- and not large enough to do millions of transactions per second).

This guys views imply a sort of scary 'idealism': "If there were a unified world government, with the world united in a singular society, then cryptocurrencies would be perfect for such a world."
The great thing about Bitcoin, which he apparently doesn't see, is that we all have a choice as to whether or not we use it; a world "united" by a "world government" would surely be the least-free world one could possibly imagine.

While it's true that merchants liquidating bitcoins will put some downward pressure on the price, if Bitcoin is ever to be seen as a real 'currency' in the eyes of the majority (or even a sizable minority), we need real businesses 'accepting' it (even if, unfortunately, many liquidate upon receipt).
So, in the short run more merchants may be bearish... but in the long run we think it's a positive. :-)
@_date: 2014-10-20 04:22:50

Casey Research has had a bad track record for the last few years... but it's my view that history will probably prove them "too early" rather than "wrong".

The dollar-denominated price of Bitcoin [rose about 100-fold in 2013]( To gloss over the underlying (mostly psychological) reasons, it's just to be expected of any market that goes up that much, that quickly; corrections tend to be a part of the process with a significant rise in the value of an asset, unfortunately. :-P

Precisely. And at no point does Bitcoin's money-supply shrink.
The bogeyman of "deflation" arises from a history of credit contractions causing havoc... Credit contractions are primarily due to the scam called fractional-reserve banking.

You're right. Probably should have mentioned it in the blog-post, but we view Bitcoin like a "startup currency"... Right now it's not for the faint of heart, but once it grows up (assuming this grand experiment succeeds), these wild price swings will be tamed.
In fact, there's no reason to think Bitcoin won't be the thing people use to measure the value of fiat, as they point out how unstable those currencies are.
@_date: 2014-09-23 19:43:01
Of course it is, but wasn't your point that credit cards are filthy, as well?
Paper money is (oftentimes) filthy, but it's just such an unimportant thing, I find it to be a silly argument. See [empire314's astute point]( on the matter as well.

Please follow bitpar's advice and disable JavaScript if you're worried about privacy (though in our case, we do not use JS to do anything aside analytics and improve the user-interface experience). Clearing out cookies (using a browser extension, for example) may also not be a bad idea. Personally, I have used both such tactics.
A website can only "collect" as much information as your web-browser and the Internet connection you use to connect to that website will give it; our Privacy Policy states clearly that we *may* make use of that info, but we certainly don't do so with intentions of spying on our users.

@_date: 2014-09-23 00:20:31
Yeah, to some degree it's all subjective -- chicken-and-egg, as you say... But that said, there's a reason gold's a sort of safe-haven (thousands-year history). So I guess it'd be pretty premature to consider Bitcoin a true safe-haven (though its track record so far is impressive).

Yeah, another good point. But if you compare the growth-rate chart (of money supply) of Bitcoin to that of about any other currency, you'll see something like the inverse -- fiat money supplies tend to increase exponentially; Bitcoin's is logarithmic (and orderly).

Widespread Bitcoin adoption may not end war entirely, but it would surely make boondoggles like the Iraq War much less likely -- consider the stereotypical supporters and opponents of the Iraq War:
* Stereotypical "conservatives" tended to support the war.
* Stereotypical "liberals" tended to oppose the war.
"Conservatives" hate paying taxes; they probably would not have supported a nominal tax increase (as opposed to a sneaky inflation tax) to fund the war. "Liberals" generally opposed the war, so likely would not have supported more taxation for that purpose likewise.

These 'problems' are almost entirely due to the fact Bitcoin is still young, and thus, its "infrastructure" and knowledge amongst the public is not as high as that of credit cards. I wish I had time to go through these one by one, but I'll just say two things:
1. "You are vulnerable to additional scams, or wallet stealing" in the same way you would be if you left your money under your bed (and indeed, even with online banking and credit cards these are problems), but in the future we will have more "Bitcoin banks" like Circle and Coinbase that take care of most of the security issues for you.
2. You're missing Bitcoin's *most important* **pro**, alongside its transfer-ability: Bitcoin is [honest money]( -- Bitcoin is a currency, an implementation of money, in its own right; credit cards are simply a gateway to other forms of money (other currencies), and all the currencies used with credit cards are raught with corruption. They're all virtually guaranteed to be worth less next year than they are this year.
This may not seem that important, but over the course of decades, it can make the difference between a [poor country]( and a [rich one]( to speak nothing of the individual hardships people go through.

He's just sayin' how it is; my guess is he's not actually in favor of the system as is. 
It's certainly true that fiat currencies *tend to* be more stable because they *tend to* have a higher market-cap... You can find the same phenomenon in stock markets -- compare the movements of blue-chip stocks to junior mining companies on the Canadian Venture Exchange, for example.
None of this is an endorsement of central banking or fiat money, though, [obviously](

I think most of what you say is merited, but we're really arguing from the "long view" (as we kind-of summed up in the last two paragraphs)... It's not reasonable to accept a five-year old currency to be stable vis-a-vis those that are *at least* decades old -- let alone a new type of money *altogether* (crypto-currency) -- but in the long run, if this grand experiment succeeds, we think the tables will be turned, be it 20, 30, 50 years down the road.

The point was simply that most major currencies (and by extension the currencies in use by a lot of people) are not an order of magnitude away from USD in terms of their base unit (dollar, pound, euro, etc). In other words, the Yen is more of the exception than the norm.

More than one of us (at Spendabit) have personally sold bitcoins in Argentina, while living there over the course of several months, in order to avoid the Queen's Rate and get the real free-market exchange rate ("dólar blue") for pesos. LocalBitcoins.com should find you buyers in BsAs, perhaps other significant cities (e.g., Córdoba). Also have had luck with the relevant Facebook groups.
BTW, the rate is currently soaring (in favor of the dollar) -- you can live quite handsomely in northern Argentina right now! (Probably other parts, as well, but speaking first hand...)

Bitcoin adoption will be a process... Just think how silly the long-standing Bitcoin-accepting merchants must feel about the coins they liquidated two years ago.
In time, as the price rises (as it must, if Bitcoin adoption is to continue) merchants that now liquidate upon receipt will warm up to the idea of holding some Bitcoin 'on the books', and they will slowly become more of a boon, than burden, to the price.
@_date: 2017-02-08 01:02:01
Agreed -- defining the meaning of our words is extremely important, at the end of the day. I would say, however, sometimes it's easier to get your foot in the door if you approach it like, "I'm in favor of government (law, order, police of some sort, etc), but I think we can find ways to fund those services without coercion." Whereas, "I'm in favor of anarchy -- but wait, you don't understand what that means," is a bit harder to get through.


Also agree, but unfortunately for a segment of the population, they shut down when they hear the word (in certain contexts)... However, regardless of the current atmosphere, I would argue that "private" is not a good word for what we're arguing; what we really mean is "not funded through coercive means".
Two cases in point: 1. The Federal Reserve is (supposedly) a "private" institution, yet it has a legal monopoly on money. 2. There exist "public" spaces that are "privately"-owned. In theory (and probably in practice in some places in the world), those privately-owned public spaces may even be "more public" than the (so-called) "publicly-owned" public spaces -- meaning, they may have more relaxed rules and hours than the "public" ones.
Hope that makes sense. :-)

There must be a limit -- whether it's one megabyte or one terabyte. Everyone agrees the limit should be greater than one megabyte (though some want it to be at a later date), and no-one thinks it should be as large as even 1 gig (at this point in time).
However, it's better if we can "test the limits" earlier rather than later, while Bitcoin is still relatively young and niche. It doesn't matter what the limit is (and there must be one), to prevent spam and, more generally, to keep the system secure/distributed.
(P.S. I had a transaction fail to get through today/yesterday, but I'm happy to deal with this short-term pain for a longer-term, stronger Bitcoin.)

Arguing that people won't upgrade their nodes is useless. Or, at best, it's an argument in favor of the soft-fork approach. (But in reality, if history's any guide, we should expect people to upgrade their software, though perhaps not as quickly as we'd like.)

One crucial thing to grasp with regard to "inflation/deflation" (which is slightly tangential to your question), is the reason so many people, usually self-described "economists", think "deflation" is bad... There are two very different phenomenon that both get conflated as "deflation":
1. The general price level falling due to increased productivity.
2. The general price level falling due to a shrinking money supply, due to a contraction of credit (i.e., loans going bad).
\ is a good thing.  is generally viewed as a bad thing, but it only happens in fractional-reserve banking systems, so (setting aside occasional bad-actors/incompetents a la Mt. Gox) it's irrelevant when talking about Bitcoin; Bitcoin is not inherently built upon a fractional-reserve, print-money-out-of-thin-air system.
Calling Bitcoin a "deflationary currency" is kind of a misnomer though; Bitcoin's supply *does not* shrink (and it in fact increases at present). But the reason "prices fall" vis-a-vis Bitcoin is due to increased demand for the currency -- so it's closer to deflation definition  than  It's a 'Good Thing' for people already holding bitcoins and arguably a neutral thing for those buying in at any given point in time.

Certainly there are people that are idiots, and since pretty much everyone is entitled to vote, then there will be some idiots voting. But you've failed to demonstrate with logic how we end up with a better result when the "idiots" vote for _some guy_, that then votes for the 'laws'... How do we go from idiots to non-idiot?
Further, I know from experience that idiots are less likely to bother with voting than non-idiots -- probably even less so in a scenario where they were voting on issues frequently, say every week or so (as would perhaps be the case under a 'direct democracy').
FWIW, I might agree with you about the lottery; we may well end up with more honest, down-to-earth people in office if it were just done by random drawing of names. :-)
@_date: 2017-08-27 20:53:32
Personally I prefer moving towards less-state/no-state (and Bitcoin is probably the most successful real-world initiative towards that goal), but if we're going to create 'laws' to jerk each other around, I fail to see how it's better to have a bunch of aristocrats (politicians) deciding "laws based on which side had a better hour long special", than people in general deciding.
In fact, we know from experience that politicians will do even worse: They will 'decide on laws' based on bribes, ideology, towing the party line, back-scratching, and power-lust. "Voters" can theoretically make decisions for all those reasons too, but power-lust will get you nowhere (when you're 1 of millions), and bribing will never pay off when you've got to bribe millions.

Nonsense. Austrian economics is more prescient now than ever; we live in a world awash of funny-money and distorted economies, _because_ of the completely-fiat system of the present era.


It's all based on principles of property rights; from there, the logic unfolds naturally. Not sure what you mean by "rentier activity", but every mainstream school of economic thought I'm aware of holds the renter/landlord relationship as acceptable.


Were you forced to take money from said "private bank"?
Ironically, most people _are_ forced to pay _more than_ 20% of their income to their feudal overlords -- sorry, "government".

There's no point in arguing about this sort of thing; it's opinion versus opinion. But I don't know where you get evidence for claims like these:

* "seashells [..] played the same role [..] for tens of thousands of years." Evidence? I don't doubt seashells were used as money for long periods of time, in certain places, but I doubt they were used for thousands of years.

The comparisons between Bitcoin and gold are completely apropos -- both are "financial assets that are not simultaneously someone else's liability", in a sense.
What doesn't make that much sense is comparing the _price_ of Bitcoin to the _price_ of gold -- that there are a max 21-million BTC is arbitrary, and (even assuming all of those had been mined and none lost) it's a pittance compared to something on the order of 5-billion above-ground ounces of gold.
But in any case, the price parity will probably have some psychological effect and the media will surely love it.

Its poor fungibility is a problem, and probably the next-most-important thing next to scaling up that we (the Bitcoin community) need to focus on. But usually when people say "sound money" they're referring to its resistance to dilution, so I wouldn't say therefore Bitcoin is not sound.

Please. Understand there's a difference between "deflation" caused by a collapsing money-supply (collapsing "credit", in reality) and "deflation" caused by increased economic productivity. I'll elaborate if it helps.
All of the banking stuff (fractional-reserving, in particular) the OP alluded to are the source of the sort of "deflation" you seem to be worried about.
(Bitcoin's "deflation" is actually from a separate source -- increased demand -- but that's largely just because Bitcoin is unique vis-a-vis traditional monies... It requires new demand; it started from zero -- necessarily. And I'm sure many people can tell you first hand, this type of deflation has *not* hurt anyone.)

It inflates the "money supply" leading to higher prices (which wouldn't be as much of a problem w/out central-banking -- as there would be no corresponding base-money increase when the lending pyramid crashed), and 2. it distorts the "capital structure" by giving an overwhelming influence on capital allocation to banking institutions.

Serious answer: You don't have to use those 'alt' coins. (In fact, you don't have to use *any* crypto-coins, but you do have the option now.)
It is a fair question though, and I can see why it bothers people that haven't spent much time studying "network effect" as well as how the crypto-currency space itself has operated for years. That said, this 'bcash' phenomenon will be a great test-case: If bcash manages to gain/retain traction as more than a niche alt-coin, then your concern may be valid -- but even then, so far it seems to have not put a dent in Bitcoin proper and has 1/10 the value.

People vote for politicians (celebrities, basically) because of where they stand on issues (at best), oftentimes one issue (as you point out). Thus, I'm concurring with your comment but also saying, how could it possibly be better to have people voting for a politician, because he's on their side on a particular issue, than it would be to just have them vote on the issue themselves? There's no rational reason we should expect the politician to be better-informed than the voter for *that* issue or any other issue -- and we'll be lucky if he (the politician) sticks to his original position on the one issue! :-)

Yes, people will need/demand loans in a Bitcoin economy, and I expect there will be willing lenders (indeed, there already are in some niche uses, like crypto-coin traders). And there will be 'banks' (there are now -- Coinbase, etc). However, just because there will be loans, it doesn't follow that there will be fractional-reserving... As long as Bitcoin remains relatively decentralized and the average person can afford to make important (high-value) transactions on the blockchain, it will act as a "check" to reveal any institution that might try to fractional-reserve.
FWIW, there already exist institutions that make loans without creating money/credit out of thin air.

Agree with your assessment in that there's opportunity here, but don't necessarily think "government" is the best adjective; a lot of people actually feel a positive connotation toward that word, especially when it comes to financial matters (however ironic). Witness this in the use of the phrase "full faith and credit of ...".
How about "printable money"?
At the end of the day, what I've discovered as an "advocate for liberty", is that certain words and certain angles work better with some people; other words/arguments work better with others -- it helps to be flexible and "feel people out" to see what things matter to them.

Individual miners have the ability to choose their pool. Better to be on the safe side... If it were clear as day the vast majority of the community wanted a change, but 90% consensus could not be achieved solely due to one or two mining pools, then the threshold could be lowered retroactively -- this of course requiring another client-upgrade for all miners wishing to implement the hard-fork, but if the majority were that cut-and-dry and the "will of the miners" that resounding, then having to upgrade one's client as an act of casting a ballot would just prove as another small safety-measure to ensure the majority were sincere and willful.
75% IMO is too low, because as you point out "one or two large mining pools" can make the difference, overnight.

Do you have a source for that?  I think you're confusing what describes for a genuine belief that transactions should be scarce.
The truth is they *are* scarce -- not *very* scarce (at least not relative to current demand), but they do have a cost. Even if the block-size limit is removed altogether, the transactions have a cost. And even if miners may allow zero-fee transactions to get through, there's still a cost, presently being subsidized by the block reward.

Preposterous. There are not two black-and-white groups of bitcoiners... Almost everyone wants the block-size to grow -- it's only a matter of how much and how quickly.
If there were no technological limits and/or nobody cared about decentralization (which is at the heart of Bitcoin's origins and usefulness) then there would be no debate... Everyone *would like* there to be limitless transactions for cheap, but balancing that with decentralization (i.e. making it so it's practical for most people to run full nodes) is the problem.
It's not black versus white.

I think you're assuming the same black-and-white choice that so many others seemed to have assumed: that we must, in essence, choose between Bitcoin being a "payment network" or a "settlement mechanism".
And I think it's probably a false choice; the payments versus settlement analogy may not hold that much water. We know the two extremes don't work: If the block-size is too small (say even less than 1MB, just for the sake of argument) then Bitcoin couldn't even be a settlement network of any real significance; on the other hand, if, to use the popular example, we want Bitcoin to be the way everyone pays for coffee and for micro-payments to stream movies, that won't scale.
However, if we can have "compromise" (however much I hate to hear that word used in politics*) it may be the case that new developments that come about before "five or eight years down the road" *de-necessitate* huge blocks; *OR*, it could be that enhancements in Internet connections make bigger blocks more practical -- who knows.
* There is a huge difference between this kind of "compromise" and the kind they make in Washington, though -- no-one is forced into it (except to the extent he wishes to continue using Bitcoin).

This is the same rationale used by both sides; it's hard to buy.
What's so frustrating is that the two sides can't seem to agree on some "middle of the road" approach... Everyone agrees the block-size should go up eventually and to some degree, at minimum. Surely it wouldn't be the end of decentralization if the block-size were bumped to 2mb and had built-in growth from there, but OTOH saying "the hell with" a large proportion of the core devs and racing ahead with 8mb blocks seems extremely brash and completely unnecessary/premature.
@_date: 2015-08-20 15:25:12


Put another way, what they're doing is not like trying to fork an email client to add new features, but more like trying to *fork the email protocol* (which would result in two separate email systems that cannot communicate with one-another).

This is a false choice; there's no more urgency now to make this decision (if it *ever* really needs to be made in such black-and-white terms) than there was years back when Satoshi added the block-size limit.
What I'm saying is, worst case, if people can keep their heads, we could have a simple step up to 2-megabyte blocks to get us through a few more years. (Not saying that's the best approach, but it would be much better, IMO, than splitting the community into tatters.)

In the strictest sense it's probably fair to say currencies are not investments, but your "post is dumb" in asserting that poor people are poor because they sit on cash. In my experience, poor people are poor because they lack motivation, knowledge, or interest in saving.
But more to your point, there are many people that are much more poor than they ought be (I'm thinking of prudent elderly people in particular) because they sit on cash. But it's not cash per se that's making them poor -- it's _fiat_ cash. Sound money tends to retain its value, despite your cherry-picked example.

Certainly it would be _better_ if we had true democracy, but it still doesn't justify coercing your neighbor to pay for pet-projects of the majority.
FWIW, "true democracy" is a bit of a pipe dream -- something you can perhaps aim for but probably never quite achieve. That said, IMO, anything closer to direct-democracy would be infinitely better than what we have in most "democratic" nations on Earth today. (Notwithstanding the grade-school propaganda about the "ignorant masses" being too dumb to vote on issues. There are certainly a lot of ignoramuses, but how do we expect them to choose good politicians if they're too stupid to even understand the issues?)

1. Would it be roughly accurate to say that the only "advantage" this exchange offers over Bitsquare is that it is browser-based (which has its obvious disadvantages as well)?
2. Could this exchange be reworked to use the same trading network as Bitsquare (so a seller on the one exchange could sell to a buyer on the other, and vice versa), increasing the liquidity of both and avoiding more dilution in an already super-thin market?

You're drowning yourselves in language. Throw out the words "public" and "private" -- they've become almost worthless in the context of politics and economics; they're just the kind of hollow buzz-words politicians use to slither around definitions like snakes.
When most people say "public", they mean something that's *owned* by 'the government' (owned by a State). But generally speaking, someone from "the public" is just as welcome to walk into a "private" Wal-Mart as he is into a "public" park.
When speaking of a traditional "public good" (something like a park), the important questions are: who sets the rules for ("owns") the property, and how did they pay for it? In the case of a "public" park, a 'government' sets the rules for (owns) the park, and they paid for it by coercing money out of people (who may or may not have wished to pay for it). With a Wal-Mart store, it's owned by a company that voluntarily acquired funds, one way or another. Likewise, there are "privately-owned" parks that are fully open to "the public", but that were not funded using coercion ("taxes").
But none of this makes any sense in the context of Bitcoin. What Martin meant by "private" was "not state-issued". But unfortunately he's under the same "public/private" delusion as everyone else it seems. :-P

Wrote a [blog post]( on that, a couple years back, which may be of some value.
The key thing Keynesians (and the general public) fail to grasp is that there are multiple types of "deflation", and only one of them is ostensibly bad. In other words, prices can fall because (a) economic productivity (and thus wealth) increases, (b) the demand for the monetary unit goes up (Bitcoin's case), or (c) because money (or credit) is destroyed.
Only (c) is "bad deflation", and it's actually *necessary* because it is artificial credit that is being destroyed, and it must be destroyed (or become a permanent money-supply increase) eventually.
@_date: 2017-09-08 14:42:42
On what time-frame? Of course if you arbitrarily pick the last 8 years, "stocks" win. Usually when talking store-of-value people think more in the decades range, though; try comparing the two for the last 100 years -- I don't have any figures offhand, but I suspect gold will be the winner. (And sorry you can't just pick "the stock market", you have to pick *particular stocks* to do the comparison -- there were no vehicles like ETFs that would have represented "the stock market" over that whole period, and there probably never will be, due to the fact specific companies come and go so frequently.)
@_date: 2017-09-08 14:55:23
You allude to a good point: "the economy" really a bit of an illusion; it's the economic activity and well-being of millions of people that are of concern. Once you break it down like that, you can ask *who* will benefit and *who* will lose.
With Bitcoin it's fairly obvious who loses (banks, politicians, and their buddies); it's less clear who benefits, but I would argue *everyone else*.

One more point (though this thread is running a bit long in the tooth by now): There could hypothetically be multiple "referendums" (proposals up for a vote) every week -- even every day -- but the vast majority of people need not vote for every issue. Any given person wouldn't have an opinion nor expertise on most issues (as is the case today -- most people are oblivious), and therefore shouldn't vote on the issue. And since we can do voting electronically now, casting a vote (say once a week) could (keyword: could) be no more of a hassle than checking your bank account.
(This also begs a question of whether there must be some minimal number of "voters" for a proposal to pass. I'd suggest, say, a super-majority must vote on the issue for it to pass -- and then a majority of that super-majority must vote *in favor* of it, still.)

He's implying we shouldn't assume the control to "authority" (the "high priests")... Lest we end up with a Bitcoin that's not too unlike the fiat-currency system, wherein we assume "The Fed" (etc) knows best.
More pragmatically, although your point probably has merit when considering "end users" on a 1-to-1 basis, that doesn't take into account the fact most end users interact with Bitcoin through a wallet software -- and wallet-software creators have an incentive to see a healthy Bitcoin ecosystem (as do all Bitcoin stakeholders, in the broad sense), so it's plausible some of them would include some sort of "block-size limit" (presumably not hard-coded, but growing based on some algorithm) in their software.
My thought is, this looks like a way to give other stakeholders in the ecosystem a "vote" on the block-size debate -- not just the core developers and miners.

Precisely. And the reason Singapore is a trade, investment, and shipping hub? Because it's one of the free-est countries on Earth (in the "economic freedom" sense). The people of Singapore are able to have plenty of 'resources', despite their native land lacking them, because they're freedom provides them the opportunity to create value for the outside world.
On the other hand, the world is full of countries that are resource rich, where the inhabitants within hardly make ends-meat because they are prevented from creating sufficient wealth (harvesting the 'resources' of their country, if you will) due to bureaucracy, corruption, "laws", etc. Sticking to the same part of the world, compare Singapore to Myanmar (which is apparently improving -- due to its markets being freed up -- but that's an aside).
For a really great example, see the contrast between Chile and its neighbors (Bolivia, in particular, is shockingly different)... And only a few decades ago Chile was poorer than some, if not all, of its neighbors.

From a security standpoint, "keychain" definitely would be better... I'm going to stick with "wallet", for the case where I'm trying to get somebody new on board, but the "keychain" analogy might be useful for explaining security (and the technical reality) to people that are already convinced of Bitcoin's usefulness.
@_date: 2015-09-04 18:15:24
There seems to be a lot of confusion with regard to what "off-chain" means... From my understanding, there are two broad but quite different categories of off-chain transactions:
1. Non-Bitcoin, off-chain transactions occurring at centralized hubs -- think Coinbase. (These are already happening.)
2. Bitcoin-compatible, off-chain transactions routed through a somewhat decentralized network of nodes. (These are still mostly theoretical, but apparently work is underway to make them reality.)
Being opposed to number 1 in lieu of "on-chain" transactions is understandable: using only off-chain transactions of type 1 would leave us in the same predicament we have with the legacy financial system with regard to privacy, trust, censorship, etc. -- the "banks" (or exchanges or wallets) have too much power.
Off-chain transactions of type 2 are entirely different though; from my understanding, they are genuine Bitcoin transactions, but they've simply *not yet* been *"branded"* into the ledger (the blockchain). These are the types of transactions the Lightning Network promises to bring.
Off-chain transactions of type 2, while they may not be as 'decentralized' as on-chain Bitcoin transactions, they are very different from, e.g., Coinbase off-chain transactions, since theoretically anyone can boot up a "hub" to route these payments around, creating a network of "routers" similar to the Internet itself -- i.e., there's no reliance on one single point of failure, nor a small set of central points of failure.
Having established the distinction, the irony of increasing the block-size too much is that the core Bitcoin network (the blockchain and mining) will become less decentralized, even though the goal is to allow for more on-chain transactions. From what I gather, everyone agrees on this point, they simply disagree (by a huge margin) on what the "magic numbers" are for the block-size -- what size it should be now and how fast it should grow.
(This is not an endorsement for or against X-megabyte blocks, but just an attempt to clarify the situation... Please critique -- this is just my understanding of the present situation/debate.)

If it's the case that having a limit to the block-size is unnecessary, then the proposal would not help scale Bitcoin. However, if it's the case that there needs to be some "artificial" constraint to the block-size (which most seem to agree on at this point in time, including even those working on Bitcoin XT -- who have included a change that merely increases the block-size limit considerably, as opposed to removing it) then this offers a new way of thinking about how we impose that "artificial" limit.
@_date: 2015-09-04 18:29:04
There was a point in time, I'll remind you, that *Bitcoin* did not exist, and everybody doubted "internet cash" was possible -- yet someone (something Nakamoto) persisted in implementing a crazy theoretical solution.
Regardless, point stands: the whole world simply *can't* use Bitcoin to perform all their transactions on-chain. (But that's not to say whether and/or how much the blockchain size should be raised today.)
@_date: 2015-09-06 19:42:45
First of all, my comment was "not an endorsement" of a certain block-size, but while we're on the subject...


The block-size must go up (and I don't claim to know by how much, when, nor how often), but I think we should be careful with this logic. Just because it's clear a majority thinks a certain action is safe does not necessarily make it so (and in this case it's not at all clear there's a majority in favor of a specific plan of action).
Additionally, we should keep in mind that Bitcoin does have enemies, and if they saw a direction that could harm Bitcoin, surely they'd agitate in favor of that direction. (I'm *not* asserting that, e.g., BitPay or Coinbase want to harm Bitcoin or see it less decentralized.)


I've seen this point made before (by you and others), but this is a good way to put it. I tend to agree (but would much rather tread lightly with any block-size changes).


This oversimplifies the situation. I'll respond with another question: who is going to keep all their funds "off-chain"?
Personally, when and if we see Lightning Network(s) come online, I would plan to keep the bulk of my BTC in on-chain-secured transactions, but LN would surely make an increasing amount of sense for day-to-day transactions as traditional Bitcoin transaction-fees go up (which they must eventually do, from what I understand, regardless of block-size changes).


Agreed. But again, I'd tend towards "better safe than sorry".
@_date: 2015-09-06 19:16:23
That depends on how you define "Bitcoin transaction"... Some might say it's not a "Bitcoin transaction" until it's recorded on the blockchain. (I'm not saying that, but there's certainly a distinction to be made.)

The whole point of these proposals (if I'm understanding them correctly) is to *help scale* Bitcoin properly... The second proposal (transaction is invalid if placed in a block that's "too large"), in particular, on its face appears to provide a way for *users* of Bitcoin (as opposed to only miners) to have a sort of "vote" with regard to what the block-size should be.

It's a moral question, not a pragmatic one. But if we're on the subject of practicality...


These are both tiny countries (relatively), each one smaller than the average "state" in the United States*. Break the U.S. into its component parts and you'll probably get a few states with 'good' education systems and others with well-run transportation.
Add to that, [both of these countries are much more free-market-oriented than the average country]( -- Switzerland being in the top five! (But I would, generally speaking, take those Heritage rankings with a grain of salt.)

My understanding is, "side-chain" usually refers to *separate* blockchains that contain bitcoin-denominated transactions. In other words, they're like alt-coins that can move bitcoins around instead of the native currency that an alt-coin usually has. (And this is where the "two-way peg" stuff becomes important, but that's getting into the details...)
Lightning Network transactions (again, from my understanding) won't really be on a "chain" at all (though they do *depend* on the main blockchain, and will be moved to the blockchain in cases where things "go wrong" on the LN).
Side-chains may be useful for scaling up the number of transactions we can do in Bitcoin-land, in addition to LN, but it sounds like the excitement with side-chains is more related to new experimental features rather than scaling (for example, more privacy in transacting).

Here are some quick responses that might help spearhead the rebuttal conversation:
1. Ask your critic to clarify what he means by "deflationary". As others have pointed out, this claim is a myth, and its genesis lies in a confusion/conflation between price-deflation (falling prices) caused by increased economic productivity (which is a good thing) and price-deflation caused by a deflating 'money' supply (which is [ostensibly] a bad thing, but it only happens because of fractional-reserve banking, which Bitcoin as a currency makes unnecessary and Bitcoin as a philosophy/community tends to abhor).
2. This (illegitimate) critique can be levered at *any* investment; every investment rewards early-adopters more than late-comers. In fact, Bitcoin could never work without this attribute, because there would be no incentive for the early-adopters to get involved (aside from technological curiosity, which almost certainly would not have been sufficient).
A ponzi scheme is a zero-sum game. Real value-adding systems (or investments) are not zero-sum; the late-comers -- even the last person to adopt -- can benefit in addition to the early-adopters (assuming they don't buy into a frenzy/bubble and get burnt when the price corrects). Compare to mobile phones, for example: the early-adopters -- and especially the early investors in the technology -- benefited the most, but that doesn't take away from the value the late-comers can gain.

Hey I've removed the limitation on searching for numeric-only values (greater than 9), so you can now search for things like [470]( (though in this case, you'll get [much better results if you search for "470 radeon"]( for example). Regarding prices in BTC, we're hoping to do a redesign of our product grid soon (the results page), and in doing so, we'll see if we can fit in the BTC price alongside (or below) the native-currency (e.g., USD) price. :-)
Thanks, and please [send more feedback]( our way when you have further complaints/ideas!
@_date: 2017-05-08 18:41:41
Cool -- hadn't come across that. Went ahead and x-posted. :-)
@_date: 2017-05-08 22:08:36
Thanks for pointing this out. What were you searching for (if you don't mind sharing)?
This has been a longstanding problem, and we put in a lot of work to minimize the issue a while ago -- but unfortunately there's no straightforward way to distinguish Newegg's "marketplace" products from their in-house products in all cases (some marketplace products have a special kind of product ID, but not all of them).
I will try to add in a custom hook for Newegg, to treat these products as "defunct", when our back-end "trash collection" process checks up on products. If you can provide any queries that have such products that would be a help. (They aren't all that common, AFAICT -- I haven't see one for a little while.)
@_date: 2017-05-04 21:32:59
Most credit-card transactions are probably still above the cost to send BTC ([assuming]( 2.3% plus a 10-cent tx fee, and that an average payment is only $20), and for sending money of any significance (say $100+), the fee is a pittance compared to any other [cross-border] mechanism. Although we'd all like lower fees, there has to be a balance; we're going to need "second layers" regardless of the block-size, eventually.

But likely if Bitcoin survives long enough, with no obviously preferable alternative or serious unforeseen problems (technical or political) arising... but hard to imagine that being any close than 10 years away (to pick a number).
@_date: 2017-05-09 19:20:20
This is wrong; a supply increase could be the stimulus to "pop" a bubble, but so too could a demand decrease... Eventually you will "run out of suckers". (Not saying we're near that with BTC at the moment, but who knows.)
I expect that (if Bitcoin continues to succeed against technical, political, etc. obstacles) we'll eventually see one last bubble -- this one perhaps a genuine one -- where Bitcoin (or, a bitcoin) truly is overvalued and is possibly on par with other major currencies (in terms of market-cap). Then, once that bubble deflates, the market could be deep enough to avoid big price spikes but still be a good store of value.

Okay, thanks for the feedback. Glad you didn't give up right away.
Regarding the number searches (470, 480, etc), we put in a limitation there to avoid people putting in useless searches like "7" or "a", which would just put extra load on our database. However, I will re-jigger things to allow for larger numbers -- but what specifically were you looking for?
Regarding the currencies, the plan was to allow the user to choose the currency -- that enhancement just kinda fell to the wayside. But I will see if we can get that back on the table.

Nice. Had intended to write a piece myself to critique this (ridiculous) idea that crypto-currency needs a "stabilization mechanism" (but so far [only hinted at it]( in other writing).
Still, there's one crucial point I think you may not have drove home: Traditional currencies (fiat monies) are only "stable" because they are such "liquid" pools of capital -- because their "market caps" are so large relative to everything else.
(This assuming we buy the argument that national currencies are stable in the first place... We have to admit, in the short run, they do tend to be more stable than other things -- usually. The recent action regarding the Swiss Franc demonstrates a great counter-example. And with all the money printing we've got to think these kinds of fluctuations will become more common, not less, in the near future.)
Best line: "Bitcoin’s exponential growth is a very strong signal, and if Bitcoin were stable, there would be no such signal."

Mr. Wu may well be a menace, but that doesn't mean the solution is forcing a chain-split (at least not so quickly and rashly).
It's interesting that one of the primary motivators (AFAICT) for choosing SegWit over other scaling methods was its ability to be implemented as a soft-fork -- to avoid the risks (a chain-split, mainly) of a hard-fork -- yet some SegWit supporters now insist it's so important that it's *worth* a chain-split.
I think Segregated Witness seems like a good scaling measure because it (as far as I understand) also brings along some beneficial "side-effects", but I hope we can activate it in a safe manner (even if it means we ultimately have to "give the finger" to one or more large mining pools).

This is the silly "currency has value because it's accepted for taxes" theory. This theory is demonstrably false, by Bitcoin's very existence; no-one (at least until recently, with the development in Switzerland) accepts BTC for tax. Gold's continued ability to hold value is another demonstration. And if you're still not convinced, spend some time in a country like Argentina, where people prefer to hold their wealth in USD to ARS (pesos), despite "their government" only accepting ARS.
I suppose one could argue that given two currencies, one accepted for taxes and one not, all else being equal, people would prefer the currency accepted for tax. But I don't think that's what we're talking about here.

Rubbish. Bigger blocks *now* may (maybe/probably) lead to more centralization. But enhancements in technology (network capacity, computing power, storage, etc) should provide a natural decentralizing force (which is why we have Bitcoin at all). The only hotly-debated question is "when" is it safe.

Bitcoin's block-size limit functions like a city gate/wall; it provides a level of security, and it's not (necessarily) something that is hoisted upon its "users" (the city-dwellers). The people living inside the wall do so at their choice, even if they would (ideally) like to see the city continue to grow as well.
The block-size limit is not the same as artificial, State-dictated production limits (for example), as some have argued -- those limits bring no security, or other, value to the system as a whole.
I'm *not* saying the block-size limit should be 1 megabyte... but whether it should be 1, 2, 4, or 400 MB, there should be a limit.

My hope is that we'll be able to design wallets that have a UX analogous to a bank 'account' that has both a "checking" and a "savings" option -- then we could completely sidestep technical explanations of what "Lightning Network" is for non-techie users.
Judging from the comments here, it sounds like this may be possible: If exchanges and other "gateways" into Bitcoin (e.g., Coinbase) allow for LN-based withdrawals, we can basically train people to use the "checking" section of their Bitcoin wallet for daily transactions, but to move (presumably larger chunks of) money to their "savings" when/if they want the funds to be more secure.

It's not clear to me that would be worse than what UASF may bring... It may come to that (that we have to allow a chain-split due to a rogue miner), but I don't see it as so urgent we need to *force* a fork. At least in that case -- if it truly were just one (or maybe a couple) major miners that didn't want an upgrade, but 90%-plus full-nodes and most miners were clearly signaling the upgrade -- users would be unlikely to get burned, since the vast majority of full-nodes would *ignore* the rogue chain.
