Woah. I actually got a coconut from the internet.

"World's first", "patented technology", "groundbreaking". You forgot "revolutionary" and "cutting edge".
You should have spent an extra 5 minutes to register a domain and hosting instead of making up vague descriptions with buzzwords.

You're no longer a full node if you enable auto pruning.
@_date: 2014-10-12 04:33:22
So does this make it just as fast as using bootstrap.dat?
@_date: 2014-10-12 08:34:46
I run a few full nodes. Please give me a coconut to encourage what I'm doing.

I'll be happy when I can pay for any eBay auction with Bitcoin without requiring any steps from the seller.

    &gt;If everybody runs that patch then the network would not be able to sync any new nodes.
Those who don't want to use a lot of space are already moving to lightweight clients. Those of us who want to run a full node will always run a full node.
@_date: 2014-10-14 03:55:06


That's an appropriate name.
@_date: 2014-10-12 08:31:29
Pruning is an option for those who want it. You have the option to choose whether you want to prune or run a full node. The patch doesn't force you to change the way you use your client.

The price charts on the left taking up half the page is annoying as hell. Didn't read.

Is there a live demo somewhere?
@_date: 2014-10-12 08:58:31
I think I now understand what this patch does.

How are you sacrificing anything when you could just use a different --datadir for testing without affecting your default directory?

    &gt;most cell phone networks are behind NAT
That's not necessarily true in all countries. In India, with a few exceptions (Vodafone), most aren't behind NAT and none of your ports are blocked. I've tested on Airtel, Tata Docomo, BSNL and Reliance.

Isn't large amounts of I/O going to reduce the life of your SD card? My 64 GB Sandisk MicroSD card died after 6 months.

Most providers don't really care what you do on your server  as long as they don't get a complaint. How long ago was this? Did you ask them to show you where in their ToS it states whether or not you're allowed to run a Bitcoin node? According to [**this story**] ( (Wikipedia), some Bitcoin users on their servers have been the target of attacks before and they probably just assumed you're also a victim.

I've seen a video on YouTube (Forgot if it was DEFCON or Blackhat; I can't seem to find that video now) but the speaker demonstrated a modified Android phone that was able to skim credit cards by spoofing itself as a POS terminal.
Is the HeliosCard resistant to such attacks?
I'll buy one anyway for small amounts for day to day use but I don't like the idea of reusing addresses. Is there a way to rewrite the card with new addresses/private keys?

I'm assuming you're talking about a specific client and the security of the money in your wallet and not the Bitcoin network itself. Trust isn't *required* but it's extremely difficult if not impossible to make it bulletproof.
1. The developer could insert a backdoor in the distributed binaries to steal private keys. Even though they will get caught almost immediately when people realize it's not a deterministic build, it could still do irreversible damage to a large number of people.
2. The website could be set up in a way that it serves the real binary to one group of people and a malicious binary to another group of people.
3. There could be bugs in one of the libraries that Bitcoin depends on (OpenSSL, Qt, Boost, miniupnpc, qrencode etc) that can cause the client to behave badly through no fault of the core developers. These bugs could be deliberately crafted by developers of those libraries. Read about [**The Underhanded C Contest**]( to understand what's possible.
4. [**The Ken Thompson Hack**]( is very difficult to detect.
5. There could be [**hardware backdoors**]( that the code can take advantage of that will mostly go unnoticed if implemented well.
TLDR; Banks can do the same and get away with it more easily so Bitcoin is relatively safe.

No, they don't.


Nice attempt at spreading FUD. Maybe you can try writing about how major [banks are involved in laundering drug money]( but it won't be fiction anymore.

How does one go about verifying that this card does what it claims to and doesn't do anything malicious?

   &gt;Much faster if you also include the time it takes to download bootsrap.dat.
That's a little vague. Are you implying it takes a long time to download bootstrap.dat?
I don't quite understand how this works but I'll test it this week when I get back home to see how much of a difference this makes. I'm not entirely sure which part of the syncing process is done faster but downloading the blockchain over BitTorrent will always be faster since it connects to more peers to fetch data in parallel to saturate your link. With about 200 connections in rtorrent, I downloaded bootstrap.dat (22 GB) in less than 10 minutes on my VPS (Approx 50 MB/s). Are there any optimizations done to make the download process somewhat comparable to doing it over BitTorrent?
If it's almost as fast then this is great news for new users.

The owner still needs to know his system is vulnerable.

You can see the progress in realtime If you run it with the *-printtoconsole* flag.

What would be the size of a block if there aren't enough transactions to fill the 20 MB space? Exactly 20 MB or would it be compressible? If not, I'm not even sure if we're at a point where the block size should be increased by 20 times. Is it not possible to have variable size blocks?
