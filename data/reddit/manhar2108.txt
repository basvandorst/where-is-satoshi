True, but they cannot stop it and they know it. Here in India, the cases are being filed and a lot of protest against that decision. Let's see how the crowd reacts in Zimbabwe
@_date: 2019-04-01 17:23:24
Lol, give it a read mate. It uses crypto for payments. No visa. 
@_date: 2018-03-30 14:06:35
Just sharing the positive news :) 
@_date: 2018-03-27 10:27:44
True. waiting for the time when it covers almost all the countries
@_date: 2018-03-27 14:32:49
Now I know why your name starts with Bitcoin ;) 
I too am gonna risk my earnings now just to tell my grandkids what I did :) 
@_date: 2018-03-27 12:47:34
You sure will :) 
@_date: 2018-03-30 18:57:02
Do share the screenshot. The link is working I checked myself again
@_date: 2018-03-27 12:53:36
Wait for Lightning to Hit or till then you can use LTC or some other crypto. 
@_date: 2018-03-28 00:39:41
Ah, I love BCASHHHHHHHHHH

The pic you sent is a possible malware, be safe and close other tabs first
@_date: 2018-03-30 19:36:42
Lol, check the link.
Open the same link in some other browser/incognito mode
@_date: 2018-03-30 20:34:10
ok, if you really think those ads are mine, go on and report the links but i won't ever do that as I am planning long term here, why would I spam people with such ads? 
@_date: 2018-03-27 14:03:32
Imagine the guy who took the loan and bought at 19k? 
@_date: 2018-03-27 15:00:34
True believer, I see. I do feel I am not ready to risk all that but yeh all investments are risky. 
@_date: 2018-03-30 08:15:24
I am holding! And buying more if we reach 5.5k 
@_date: 2018-03-27 12:05:10
This guy understands what I wanted to say. 
@_date: 2018-03-28 00:38:52
Not at all. With LN coming soon, I am bullish about btc and finally happy to be able to use btc to make small transactions. It's patience that we need now
@_date: 2018-03-27 14:22:53
I do respect your optimistic view but it is too risky if you ask me.
@_date: 2018-03-27 19:13:21
Ah, If price defined everything then VIB was supposed to be the best coin after the Binance pump! 
Let the bulls accumulate and wait
@_date: 2018-03-30 18:54:15
How exactly? 
@_date: 2018-03-27 11:07:14
That was intentional to raise awareness about scams like bitcoin cash ;)
@_date: 2018-03-27 14:59:38
True. That's the main concern.
@_date: 2018-03-27 10:28:10
Will be trying myself soon 
@_date: 2018-03-27 12:22:35
See, this is where the adoption begins. 
Thanks mate for this gesture :) 
@_date: 2018-03-30 15:53:47
@_date: 2018-03-30 21:12:44
For the last time, my website is not affected. Do you think other Reddit users won't have reported or commented the same if the issue was there? 
 
Check the link yourself. 
@_date: 2018-03-27 19:12:39
That's temp. And you really think anyone will give gold using BTC? As of now, the time and fee are too much being practical. 
@_date: 2018-03-28 16:03:04
It surely is! 
Fewer scams, more trust on crypto, more adoption= Better crypto world!
@_date: 2018-03-30 18:17:12
Yes, money is important but not worth destroying our self!
Walks, Music, Family time anything which makes us feels good can help.  
@_date: 2018-03-27 13:17:42
Do update the comment when you finally do it. If you need anyhelp, do message me. I'll try to do as much as I can :) 
@_date: 2018-03-28 16:35:56
Exactly my point! 
@_date: 2018-04-03 15:24:08
They blamed transparency and Regulations for the same! 
Transparency? seriously? 
@_date: 2018-04-08 10:03:51
True! 
@_date: 2018-04-08 10:03:15
Apparently yes, they have internet. They are more advanced than you think
@_date: 2018-04-05 16:05:02
When we signup on an exchange, they take our details and those exchanges are bound to share the same for Tax and stuff. Further, the banks linked can easily tell them about the BIG WHALES, No need for an email address dude. 
Get it now? 
@_date: 2018-04-02 21:18:17
I know it is not that big an issue but for a bearish market like this, this can affect a lot! Let's see how the market reacts. 
If you ask me, 6k for sure this time and hopefully the bottom! 
@_date: 2018-04-02 21:29:04
Surely a good news but whenever we see the word ban, the reaction is always panic
@_date: 2018-04-08 10:43:33
Again, less advanced than you think ������
@_date: 2018-04-02 21:47:30
True, it's next to worthless but those companies make a lot by fooling many 
@_date: 2018-04-02 21:55:08
Ah, just search youtube and how many people are interested in that free money which they will never get
@_date: 2018-04-05 15:39:30
They do listen to the people. This is the least we can do. 
@_date: 2018-04-05 15:51:18
They have all our details already. What good is a email.
