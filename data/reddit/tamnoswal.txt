Ok, so this whole Baidu situation may be overstated...

The Moonshot, as a price, will be an effect of a much wider adoption of Bitcoin.  That's my end game, that is my hope: that Bitcoin is exposed and accessible to as many people as possible.  If that means certain points of this process are regulated or centralized, so be it.
I agree with the core tenets of Bitcoin (decentralization, personal responsibility, distributed consensus network, etc.) but we have to realize that for Bitcoin to expand and become available to the average user we'll face a litany of rules and regulations over the course of the next several decades.
Regrettably, there will always be corruption regardless of how positive the innovation.  Bitcoin is still a "Wild West frontier," and while there are many hard-working, honest people trying to build something good and pure there are always bandits and grifters looking to take advantage.  Personally, I don't see a need for The Bitcoin Foundation, as I don't see them really doing what they've promised, but that's just one man's opinion.
This is reality, and I appreciate your idealism.  It's still so early in the game, and we can only fathom as to what Bitcoin will become over the next few years.  My thought is that financial institutions will simply use Bitcoin to offer inexpensive money transfer services.  Perhaps, further down the road, Bitcoin will be used to back other currencies and we may see a Bitcoin standard emerge.  
There are so many possibilities, and I just want Bitcoin to get its fair shot, regardless of those who believe they'll be able to control it.  That said, bring on the regulations and bring on the Dark Wallets.

Cold storage is cool, but definitely get that BTC off Coinbase and into a wallet you control (ideally Bitcoin-QT on your comp) until you're ready to move it to cold storage.  Create a bad-fucking-ass passphrase and back the wallet up on a flashdrive.

Working and saving the past couple years (I'm not married, don't have kids, no girlfriend currently) so I was fortunate enough to be able to scrimp and save.
I've been following Bitcoin for almost 3 years now, and I try and get as much information as possible.  I've also gotten more interested in money markets and foreign exchange from researching Bitcoin.
The best article that I read was by Justin Rowlatt (BBC World Service) [Why do we value gold?](  It got me thinking about why we value gold and how that valuation differs from (and in many ways mirrors) how we value Bitcoin.  
Please [read the article]( but the TLDR; is that of all the elements on Earth only 8 noble metals (platinum, palladium, rhodium, iridium, osmium, ruthenium, gold and silver) had suitable attributes to be considered for coined currency (a standardized store of value).  However, most of these 8 were too rare to work as a functional currency for the ancient world, platinum couldn't be melted with ancient forges (1768C melting point), which basically left only gold and silver as true functional candidates for ancient currency.
So the real reason that we use gold and silver, is that we've all decided to based on the favorable attributes and properties of these metals.  Ancient Romans weren't thinking about computer components or conducting electricity, so inherent value was based on the usability and suitability of these elements, namely, gold and silver for a functional currency.
This was the shit that blew my mind.  Bitcoin offers and entirely new set of properties and attributes that align with our current needs and take advantage of modern technology (WiFi, smart phones, e-commerce, etc.).  This is why I believe Bitcoin (and the concept of decentralized cryptocurrencies) will be huge.  This is why I'm buying in.  When the world is ready to adopt Bitcoin on the same scale it adopted gold long ago, we'll be in effin' business.

The market cap for Bitcoin is currently $USD 8.17B, while the global economy market cap is roughly $USD 71.83T (2012).  So currently, Bitcoin represents ~0.01% of the world economy.  By "massive scale" I mean if Bitcoin became even 0.1% of the global market cap.
Did you actually believe that Bitcoin would exist and grow without drawing the attention of financial regulatory agencies around the world? Do you actually believe that this is the end-all, be-all regulation that Bitcoin users will have to embrace for the next 20 years?  Do you actually believe that this regulation will hinder the relentless innovations that are occurring in the Bitcoin economy on a global scale?
The main priority of Bitcoin should be getting it into the hands of every single person that wants to own and use it, regardless of technology, nationality or base regulations that will make this a reality.  I'm not a proponent of regulation, but I realize that it is incipient and inevitable.

I wouldn't worry too much about the buy-in price, since you can slowly accumulate Bitcoin with small 0.1BTC - 0.01BTC buys.
I've seen a number of people miss out by "waiting for the price to go a little lower," like my buddy who was waiting for Bitcoin to go down to $75 before it jumped up to $255, and then $1100.
That said, don't feel rushed and invest when/if you feel comfortable.

It all comes down to a guessing game. I believe I'm about as well positioned as I can be if the market continues with a downward trend, but I believe we may have hit the bottom of the trough.
Back in 2011, I was buying BTC at $11/each headed down to $3 and I was unphased (southside of broke, $13K debt, but unphased).  The tech is solid and the innovative potential is seemingly limitless.

We must conceptualize bigger things for Bitcoin (and the Blockchain) than simply transferring value.  The very notion of a decentralized, globally-shared stream of information affords such great potential.  The Blockchain will be used for much more than just a record of Bitcoin transactions, perhaps a variety of sidechains to store publicly assessible information (geographically specific public transit info, annual reports for publicly traded companies, social media profiles, etc.).
I can't count how many times I've seen this graph over the last few bubbles ($33, $255, $1175), but the only thing we need to accept is that Bitcoin and the tech derived from it are still in the early stages of development.
I used to be like you and the hot tub used to be boiling, but I've gotten used to it.  I value crashes to shake the tree and send all the fairweather Bitcoiners, looking to make a quick buck, into a panic sell; weak constitutions challenged.
Let's start looking at Bitcoin for the Blockchain, not the price.

I saw [this article]( discussing why we view gold as having value as a good starting point.  
The TLDR; of it is that of all the elements on the periodic table, only 8 noble metals exist, of which 2 (gold/silver) were the only suitable elements for coinage (other noble metals too scarce or unable to melt with ancient forges).
So this opens a person's mind up to the concept of "intrinsic value," after all Ancient Romans weren't planning on gold and silver being used in computer components.  I then say, "Bitcoin is to gold, as email is to letters," and watch their fucking mind get blown.
As they are questioning the very reality that surrounds them, the rest is a walk in the park; describing the features of Bitcoin and overviewing the recent events in policy, adoption and technological updates.
Then, you know what I do?  I don't talk to them about it again. 
Not until they ask me.  It may take a month or two, but they always come back to ask about it.

Bulls are generally buying (positive outlook) and Bears are generally selling (negative outlook).  This makes sense when we look at [the stages of an economic bubble]( and see the Bear Trap and Bull Trap.
The Bear Trap comes first, as the bearish investor sees the asset begin to rise in value and wants to make whatever money possible and get rid of the asset.  This occurs before the meteoric rise and the bearish investor weeps thereafter.
The Bull Trap comes after the asset value has seemingly peaked. A sudden shift back up in value will entice the Bullish investor, believing the asset has rallied and will continue upwards again, into buying more of the asset before the "correction."  The bullish investor weeps thereafter.

Here was my thinking:
* Bitcoin is some solid tech with a huge potential (and its value is generally pegged to utilization, volume)
* For me, I figured out how much I could invest in Bitcoin, and then cut that amount in half.
* I came up with a plan of action (Buy-in, Sell Off, Contingencies) I'm putting in $5000 and trying to get my principal back with Bitcoin to spare.
* I'm sticking to my plan.  I've seen my friends getting greedy and screwing themselves over with panic buys and panic sells.

There's a lot of flak being directed at Ben Lawsky and I honestly can't understand why.
This is just the next new set of financial regulations, the first of presumably several iterations in NYS.  Are some ridiculous and seemingly unsustainable? Yes, but the fact that Mr. Lawsky is trying to bring Bitcoin into the mainstream, albeit by appeasing the unreasonable demands of the current financial system, should be commended.  I can't even imagine the amount of shit this guy probably had to eat to even get to this point.  You don't have to agree with the result, but you should certainly respect the effort.
When FinCEN declared Bitcoin a currency I recall a great deal of jubilation and well as curmudgeonly groans on r/Bitcoin, and the same went for when the IRS declared it an asset.  The classification and regulation of Bitcoin is what needs to happen for it to be adopted on the massive scale required (by financial institutions, small business innovators and consumers) for the proverbial "Moonshot."  Whether the purist Bitcoin users follow these regulations, or find creative loopholes, is an entirely separate matter.

What about those unbanked people without computers, smart phones, or electricity?  How can they benefit from Bitcoin in this "pull your head out of your ass" system?
Bitcoin will become so much more than what we currently understand and justify.  That said, I'm all about personal responsibility and recognize that centralization goes against the ideals of Bitcoin.  However, if a person needs to temporarily use a centralized system to acquire Bitcoin (and then transfer it to a wallet of which they are the sole possessor) that's fine with me.
The flexible sapling survives the storm, while the rigid oak is uprooted.  We just need to stay flexible and realize that most of this regulation will prove to be ineffective.

**8 Bitcoin Rules**
1) If you don't possess the private keys, you don't own the BTCs.
2) Backup, backup, backup.
3) Use strong passwords, never lose your passwords.
4) Be accountable for your Bitcoin or contribute to "The Void"
5) Take it easy. Yes, it's the decentralized money of the future, and yes as the "Internet of Money" Bitcoin has the potential to be something truly powerful and empowering... anyways, so those of us within the Bitcoin community understand that you'll have this, "Holy F s this could be like,  being able to buy shares in a New Internet... omg" moment. Dude, seriously, been there. Haha... seriously, though. Oh man, my omg moment? So I read this article back in late 2013, a BBC piece about why we value gold like how did gold come to be valued where it's at today. And long, insightful article short; modern features and adoption. Bitcoin is like the perfect store-of-value/token for the Internet Age that is being run on the biggest, best, most diverse network available on Earth.
See what I'm doing here?
It's easy to get carried away. Short bursts.
6) Don't invest more than you can afford to lose.
7) Backup, backup, backup, backup, backup.
8) All good things take time.

By storing your Bitcoin on Coinbase you do not possess the private keys, so there isn't much you can back up.

I'm still trying to wrap my head around this idea of "free Bitcoin Cash." You need BTC to claim BCH, but from where is BCH's value derived?
Why do I have this uneasy feeling that by claiming any BCH I would be tainting my existing BTC holdings? Is BCH's value simply that it serves as a marker for existing BTC?
By claiming/creating BCH what effect will that have on the BTC used to claim BCH? Could the generated BCH then be utilized to gain access to the original BTC used to claim/create.
If Bitcoin has taught me anything, it's that *nothing is free*.

I was truly excited when I read about the possibility of USPS operating as Bitcoin exchanges, and while people would relinquish aspects of their privacy (and personal responsibility), ease-of-use increases.
Additionally, having a USPS "Bitcoin-trained" exchange rep to aid in transactions for inexperienced Bitcoin users may serve to reassure and support the inexperienced and bolster adoption.

I look at this the way that I look at the Internet.
There is a "safe and regulated" visible Internet, that's accessible via consumer browsers and searchable via Google, Yahoo and Bing.  However a majority of the Internet is the "Deep Web" that most consumer Internet users ~~never~~ rarely visit.  
More personal responsibility is required to effectively benefit from use of the Deep Web, similar to managing personal wallets and private keys with use of Bitcoin.  Ideally, Bitcoin users will possess the private keys for all their wallets.
Nonetheless, Bitcoin users may elect to surrender some or all of that personal responsibility for ease-of-use and/or perceived security in the same manner people keep most of their cash in the bank and not under a mattress.
So, no need to admonish anyone for using Coinbase or other third-party services; they serve a purpose and act as catalysts for widespread adoption.  Create Bitcoin resources, tutorials and walk-throughs to help new users access Bitcoin as it was intended.  Our personal responsibility doesn't just end with managing our own private keys; we must share our knowledge to empower new users and allow the Bitcoin economy to flourish.

Coinbase is probably getting fucking shelacked when everyone and their brother is slamming the system trying to buy/sell/transfer their funds, effectively DDoSing the shit out of their servers.

Not sure if we should all start freaking out, but when I logged into my Mt. Gox account, my buy orders (around $80 - $50) were missing.
Furthermore, when I checked [Bitcoinity]( I noticed that all the buy an sell orders in the cumulative depth chart outside of the $107 - $117 range are missing as well.

The charge for transferring from Mt. Gox to OKPay was only $7.46USD, so I'd imagine it'd be something reasonable.  
Where I got jammed up was using OKPay's wire transfer which cost me close to $80.00USD to transfer to a checking account in the US.

I heard the same thing about Bitcoin never hitting $100 after the $30 crash. Bitcoin in unprecedented, but not fucking magical. Straight gains of  150%+ daily were bound to run out of steam in this undeniable bubble.
I def got caught in the Bear trap around $21, and sold a handful. However, I was able to sell all the way up to $241 and avoided the Bull trap yesterday, when the price rebounded from $105 to $180.  I really hope people weren't buying in heavy at that time.
We'll probably see Bitcoin come back down around $50-$75 depending on the staunchness of the miners/sellers.  It'll be hard going back to selling BTC for $20 a pop when you saw the mountain-top at $266.

People trying to day-trade in Bitcoins are absolutely ridiculous, and will most likely end up poor and Bitcoinless.  Those who are in it for the long-haul, are kicking back and watching the panicky dim-wits eating eachother alive.
I think it's kind of funny (in a sick sadistic way) that all these Bitcoiners were seeing their BTC portfolios explode in value over the past 2 months but unwilling to cash out to see their gains realized for the concern that they could profit more from a continued rise.  
At the time, the opportunity cost of losing out on more profits, exceeded the gains that could be made from selling at $150, $175, $190, $210.

Hindsight is 20/20.  
Also, numerous traders may fail to consider the capital gains taxation on all their earnings.  This can be especially risky when a trader sells a bunch of Bitcoin for a profit, buys back in with the profit and then Bitcoin tanks.  The trader is still responsible for the capital gains made on the initial profit, even if all profits were reinvested and value is lost as the price sinks.
Buy 20 BTC @ $20 ($400 principal) 
Sell 20 BTC @ $1000 ($19600 profit)
Buy 21.77777777 BTC @ $900 ($19600 reinvested)
Bitcoin drops to $500 ($10888 portfolio value)
Capital gains ~28-30% (assets held less than a year)
$19600 * 30% = $5880 capital gains tax
You'd have to sell 11.76BTC to cover your tax liability, leaving you with ~10BTC about half of what you started with.
Obviously, I'm a big BTC fan boy, and I hold a shred of resentment for those simply looking to get rich quick instead of gaining a greater appreciation for what Bitcoin represents and its potential for growth and adoption.

I didn't take into account that if you sold your 11.76BTC @ $500 you'd be selling at a loss of $400/each, which would give you a $4704 loss against the profit of $19600, netting $14896 (now $4468.80 in tax liability @ 30%).  However, to do this you'd be selling at a loss to cover only a fraction of the taxes.
This consideration is based on the IRS noting that BTC was exchanged for USD (even if the USD was still on the marketplace and not withdrawn into a bank account).  This is certainly a gray area, as the US Government has only recently declared Bitcoin to be a legitimate currency.

It really is frustrating when Bitcoin's relative anonymity is constantly associated with illicit activities.  
I'd speculate that more drug trade and illicit activity is conducted using US dollars than any other currency on Earth, but the US dollar hasn't been demonized as the currency of choice for human traffickers and drug cartels.
The potential exists to murder an individual with a hammer, the same as the potential exists to use Bitcoin to conduct illegal activities.  Thankfully, we've recognized that both (hammers and Bitcoin) are extremely useful tools that can do a great deal of good in the hands of reasonable and kind-hearted people.

Gotta love how all the speculators, transfixed on the price and trying to make those sweet short gains, are also the ones panic-selling and losing their shirts.

If by paperwork, you mean: they lied on their application claiming, fraudulently, that they would not be using their Dwolla account for everything they used it for; then yes, it was simply a paperwork issue.
Since they so radically violated Dwolla's terms, I doubt we'll see Dwolla back on Mt. Gox. Maybe they can pay some ridiculous fee like HSBC did for laundering cartel funds.
