I guess I'll be the mature one.
T.I despite his many issues with the law is definitely not a dummy rapper T.I and T.I the person who is articulate come across very differently.
He's not dumb is what I'm trying to say  despite everyone assuming he is.. because of course "rappers must be dumb".
That aside I doubt he quite understood what he was promoting he's never come across as tech savvy. To some degree he has a responsibility to be mindful of what he is promoting putting his name in the headline of the article and/or the lawsuit is just a way of getting publicity.

I usually just lurk in this sub. I'm into crypto but CURRENTLY own no BTC for reference.  Gold and Silver have value because society as a whole has come to a consensus that it is indeed valuable, while I admit it is more than it just being pretty, the value exists now because it is ingrained in us as a society.  It is the perception that the commodity is valuable which makes it such, if tomorrow everyone thought bottlecaps had value, guess what, you could buy shit with bottle caps.  
Bitcoin has value, whether you believe the intrinsic value is $4000, $400, or $4 is up to you, but you appear to be dismissing it simply because it doesn't fall in line with what (up into the last decade) society normally perceived as a valued asset.  
As far as copying code...I can copy a dollar, it does not give that copied dollar value. You can copy Bitcoin, but people will have to accept the copy to give it value.

the action or process of investing money for profit or material result
In what world is an investment only in companies???
I don't think you quite have the understanding of value you think you do. You mentioned a couple of times there are 1072 cryptocurrencies as if that is supposed to devalue it...there are 81 metals, I admit, not as many cryptocurrencies, but metal is still valuable and each metal has it's own unique value.
