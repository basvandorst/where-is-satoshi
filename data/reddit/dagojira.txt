It is essentially barter

No, converting to a different asset is still a taxable event.
It might be hard for authorities to enforce it, but taxes are owed.

So lets talk numbers here.
What is your estimate of the percentage of the sales price that a stock photo site pays to a PSP (payment service provider)?
I would estimate this figure to be below 5%.
So using Bitcoin would allow you to be cheaper by e.g. 4%. Question is whether that will suffice to attract users.
When it comes to decreasing your own share of profit (unrelated with payment methods offered) I would ask myself why people haven't founded a new site that does exactly that. Could be that there is cost associated with getting traffic to your site for example.
