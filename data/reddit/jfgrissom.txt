Way too many ways to answer your question:
Assuming you are not trading with margin...
Here is one thing you could do. When you see 100% profit sell 50%. Then you got your initial investment back. Good way to "play reasonably safe".
Hold it for the next 2 years and see what happens. Some are "forecasting" $13K BTC by next February. Stranger things have happened.
Me personally, I buy and hold for at least a year (assuming you are going to pay taxes on your gains this is ideal for paying the lowest amount of capital gains).
I usually plan for an exit a long time out. For me, the long game has been the lowest stress and biggest gains.
I hope you figure out what you want to do.

That isn’t the price, it’s the number of open shorts. Right?
It would be awesome if the price “dropped” to 17,118 USD.

I'm doing a Litecoin video today so hopefully that will offer something useful to you.
Regarding OMG:
I have not personally traded any assets like OMG.
Currencies (fiat and cryptos), stocks, and commodities are all I really understand. I have not wrapped my mind around crypto assets just yet.
It is nice to meet you. Always good to touch base with others who trade. 
I'll have another video for you in a few hours.

As promised, I just published an LTC video over on YT and DT. 
I hope it's useful.

For any fans of steemit, I cross-posted this on dtube also.
I hope it's helpful.
