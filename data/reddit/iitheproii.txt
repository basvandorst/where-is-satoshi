Difficulty isn't reflected by the price of bitcoin the difficulty is determined by how many blocks are mined. if bitcoin suddenly hit 1 million dollars then it would be profitable for anyone to mine at this difficulty but bitcoin  will never hit 1 million because there isn't that kind of demand. If you wanna make bitcoins the easy way is to mine scrypt algorithm coins like litecoin. Dogecoin is doing better then litecoin, mine that and exchange it on cryptsy for bitcoin. You still get bitcoin but your not mining it, your mining litecoin then exchanging it, and the difficulty isn't destroyed by asics or fpgas so basically anyone with a gpu can mine and make some money.

If you buy bitcoins and they make it out alive then the market goes back up to 800 then you have made money, its likely that mt gox will recover then the market will go back to normal, the downside being that mt gox runs away with everyones money witch i think is unlikely.

If they are worth 1 million each of course they would be profitable i would be making 300$ a day on 800kh you wont need asic performance if bitcoin was worth 1 million

The title should be "Drug dealers have second thoughts about selling there drugs online" most people are going back to silkroad because drug dealers want money and junkies want a fix.

Sorry i ment profitability not probability, with a knc miner you would brake even in 10 days at current difficulty
