OP Ignore this stupid advice.  You lose money when the price goes down.  You gain it back when the price goes up.  If you need your money before now and possible date when the price goes back up you will be sol. And no one knows if/when it will happen.  
If you are investing money that you actually need then you need to rethink whether that money should be in crypto.  If you don’t need it then decide if you want to wait it out or not.  
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:32:23
I don’t know what your situation is.  The truth is that NO ONE knows what’s going to happen.  I “know” based on my analysis.  I think we’ll see a new low today.  I could be wrong. Do your research.

I just tried out long range modeling and some interesting things show up.  
1. long range (year +) modeling error rate is insanely erratic.  Its almost comical.  However - and this may be an error - the error shows a decreasing frequency. like its trending towards stability.  I need to figure out what the hell I am looking at but thats interesting.  I've not tried this before so not sure if this is the right interpretation.
2. there is room for 5-7 cryptos to exist and thrive.  Asymmetry goes crazy after 7 but seems to start at 5 hence my range.  Im talking global here btw.  No idea about local - too hard to reconfigure for this.  It could be the asymmetry is a function of the algorithm but thought id share in any case. 
Interesting. 
If you have a model that can do this and is showing similar things (or opposite :) ) let me know. Would be cool to compare notes.

There is no reason to think it will drop.  Any BTC owner that wanted to dump BCH would have done so long ago.  They are both going up - why not stay diversified?  Plus there are a ton of people that bought after and dont have BCH and they are going to pour money into it because there is a lot of public hype about it.  
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:01:38

Yeah. I was expecting the gold analogy to come up.  While there are similarities only a fool would think they are identical.  Two important things to note - 1. the value of gold is highly volatile and it is not on a never ending rise to the moon.  2. There are other very useful golds out there.  Bitcoin is not perfect.  By far. It’s advantage is being the first mover but “First” becomes murky in time.  
To be clear I’m not saying it will not have value.  Im just saying that it needs to have more utility than just a bunch of wishful thinkers hoping it goes up. 
Blind optimism is not the recipe for success.  It IS the problem.  
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:46:54

My model only knows about bitcoin.  I try and under other coins movement based on it but I’m just human. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:38:06
Uhhh... you mean the severely glitched view in gdax?   Thats a bug.  If there was a blood bath coming people would be dumping everywhere else. But they are not and the price is actually going up.  
You do know that coinbase is not the only trading platform right?
Bitcoin is going to drop when BCH trading actually opens. How low and for how long I have no idea.  As i've posted about in other places - its going to get bumpy. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:36:23
Yes.  But it went back into 13s before it did that.  
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:39:25
Coinbase is under a lot of load right now.  :)
I can't even see the depth chart.  Plus trading coinbase is showing the actual price of BCH though gdax is showing the wrong price.

Uhhh i can’t screen shot a neural network.  The interface is cli over net to hosted cloud.  I just ask it for a prediction on a particular timeframe and I get a price and a confidence.  It’s pretty lame and I guess I could spiff it up with UI but it’s not intended to be a product.  So I just run a script that checked predictions in Fibonacci hours (because why not) and usually things stay pretty consistent from run to run within a short span. But now I’m seeing confidence variance changing for longer timescales  but it’s consistently showing a drop.  I’ve not seen this before.  I can’t explain the confidence changing so wildly within an hour and more confusing is why the price prediction is consistent despite the variance. The only way I’ll really know if it’s wrong is if it turns out to be wrong.   I can yank the data source I added recently and see if that changes but I can see how that source would be driving this. It’s not had enough time to influence much. I don’t know.

The problem is hype.  My model is showing some very strong and disturbing signs.  At least my guess is hype. I don’t understand my model anymore.  In any case dark clouds.   Or my model is becoming a crazy old man with schizophrenia .. which is a possibility.  
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:46:07
It went down to 13.5 after going back up over 15.  Look at up. Models aren’t perfect but it showed a big dip which it did do.   Same model is showing one coming.  This time it’s 13 and not 11 or 12 as the past one showed. If you are a hodler ignore this.  Keep hodling.  If you are a trader then you might find it useful.  
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:29:41
Actually I changed my prediction from 11 to 12.  And it went to 13.5 from 15.7. So 1.5.  Which is off but not 2.5 off.  If you have a better model - by all means share it.    This one is pretty good.  
I bought btc a while back and forgot about it.  I wasn't an expert then FOR SURE.  Excuse me for geeking out on it every day since bought it.  But I have a ton of experience in currency trading.  Whether you like it or not this is a currency.  And it behaves in a lot of ways like a currency of a small emerging country.  The big difference is that it is operating at a global scale.  
So not knowing about the intricacies of hardware wallets or the best way to convert coins doesn't invalidate my opinion.  
My model has now shifted the drop from 13 to 14.    It may change again.  This is based on a AI model that I have used on currencies and it is now learning how to function with BTC.   I am making money trading.  Its working for me.  I simply publish when I get bigger indications in an attempt be helpful.  And if you are curious the timeframe is usually within the next 6 to 12 hours.  If you want to know what is going to happen at 2:27 PM ET then sorry I cant help.  
Is it possible that it will be completely wrong?  YEP!  It can be wrong and will be wrong.  For sure.   Is it still a useful tool and is it getting better with time?  Absolutely.  
Philosophically the long term with BTC is sound.  It will go much higher.  This is something I "believe" - not something that a model is showing me.  The short term is absolutely not sound and I cannot see this kind of volatility and not try and make more money on it.  
Now as to this local prediction - there is still a some pending lack of support.  So I expect a drop.  I may hit 15 or just under.  If the model is working well then it will go to 14.   if shits on fire it may go to 13 though based the prediction trend I dont see that happening.  I see interesting stuff happening on monday as well but the confidence in those prediction is very low at the moment.  
Do with this as you please.  
@_date: 2017-12-31 03:39:15
Perfect example of the stupidity at play.  I’m sorry for using that strong word but holding is NOT using it.  I understand your first order thinking but this requires a bit more to understand.  
@_date: 2017-12-31 04:41:00
You’re confusing speculating use and utility use.  Money in a bank account generates some return.  Usually.  It’s shitty but it’s there. So the use of that money is to accrue value st a snails pace.  The money itself is actually being actively used - hence the reason the bank can offer a return in the first place.  
Holding bitcoin is not like this at all.  It’s like hoarding beanie babies because you think beanie babies will be valuable in the future.  They will be or a short time but the lack of practical use will doom beanie babies where only a fringe number of collectors will buy them.  And given that there are still millions in circulation the price won’t be that high.  Like decorative plates and stamps.  
Bitcoin can only only have widespread value if it has practical utility.  Otherwise it is doomed. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:21:32
@_date: 2017-12-31 04:22:48
That was about holding being the same as using.  That idea is just stupid.  
@_date: 2017-12-23 06:11:17
I am a HUGE supporter of the idea of bitcoin.  It is the future without a doubt. 
But whether bitcoin is the one to rule the future is very much up in the air.  Technology is technology.  It changes.  Also do not underestimate the fees problem.  Bitcoin also has an insanely long confirmation period.  There are better options right now.   
Nokia was THE cell phone maker until it wasn’t. 
I have made more than my share of money with bitcoin and I will always love it for this reason.   But what it am seeing now with everyone, literally everyone, becoming an “investor”.  And bitcoin has some serious problems.   Deep problems.  Fixable problems but still problems.  Problems that will require cooperation and agreement with the miners.   I can’t pretend to know the future but my brain hurts when I try and solve for bitcoin specifically.  Crypto is fine but any one is just super hard.  Anyways...I’m rambling.  Back to my movie.  
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:50:49
$1000 is not really a lot.  If you are very nervous about it - dump now.  You shouldn't be in the market to begin with.

What is your mechanism for fall off of requests to a limited resource under load?   I use fib in those cases because it works pretty well. In this case it’s not load but error so I’m just using it because as I said in my comment “why not”.  
Are you modeling?  I’m happy to geek out and talk models.  I just don’t want to get into a who’s smarter than who with someone that just took an undergrad course on AI and now thinks he knows everything.   I’m not claiming to be a genius or extremely knowledgeable but I’m working on a pet project and I’m trying to validate its output.  Only one person has actually earnestly asked to learn more. Most people doubt.  Some people just want to benefit from it.  And then some want to claim superiority.  Anyways...
@_date: 2017-12-31 04:43:05
Yeah. It was a cool story.  
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:43:54
This is not a “model” in the classic sense. It is an “open ended” learning algorithm.  Not anywhere close to the big ones but it’s my experiment in this space.  So this is a game and it’s trying to win. And I am able to add data sources to the game and it learns to include, and in some cases I’m sure exclude, the data.  So I’m pretty careful about adding new sources as they would be in for the long haul ..which would just cost me more money but that’s another matter.  
Initially I could approximate what the predictions were based on but now it’s very hard to know.  Which is scary in a way.  Because if it’s having a meltdown there no way to really know until you’ve lived through its massive error.   
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:11:34
Just FYI:  my model shows the price going to 15 or 15.5 in the next 24 hrs.   Can’t see beyond that other than turbulence but that’s what it’s showing.

@_date: 2017-12-21 18:08:59
I’ve thought about that.  It’s a running model so at this point “open sourcing” it is having others build their own model and plug in their own data sets to it. The other thing is to let others access my model.  I will not do the latter because people knowing the details of my model can attempt to counter it.   The former though would be interesting.    I think once I become more confident that it’s just not a luck machine and that it’s not in the middle of a meltdown then I’d be open to it.

The mainstream public will be led by usability as it relates to their ability to make purchases.  And that is predicated by retailers accepting the terms.  And bitcoin is not usable as a utility.  It’s still just a good idea.  In fact usability is getting worse.  
Regarding their ability to understand multiple coins.... 99.99999 don’t understand bitcoin. They don’t know what it is!   It’s shocking.  I’ve asked lots of so called experts to test their understanding and only a very few actually get it.  Which means the pressure points and fragile points are just not understood.  In all fairness fiat is not well understood either but holy shit this is technology based currency.  All the safeguards learned over thousands of years with fiat don’t exist at all. And the opportunity for fraud is going to be expand exponentially before it starts getting reigned in.  I laugh because the model of having a safe owned currency faces the same problem of having a safe computer.  LOL. And computers previously just had value in that they could be used as bots and the occasional op to impersonate but now they are literally storehouses of real actual value.  
And so on and so on....things will get worse before they get better.  And part of getting better requires large scale education of how crypto works and how to be secure.  This will take time.  
And this is not even counting black swans.  Like quantum which now has extra fuel.

That would be easier but no. AI trading program.  It’s getting a bit spooky as more often than not I can’t explain why it’s making the predictions it’s making.  
[Yesterday](  it was showing a drop in the 24 hrs to 15 or 15.5.   I didn’t think it was realistic but we’re now near 15.5.  
It will continue to fluctuate for the next while but something big is coming.  And it could be a glitch and the error may go away over time but right now the prediction is a biiiig drop within a month.
