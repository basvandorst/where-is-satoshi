Coinbase may not necessary support these forks on day1. You may have to transfer your coins to a Trezor wallet and if Trezor supports the new coin you will get it there.
So get your wallet ready (to avoid last minute rush).

You get free coins which would be of value....as long as you own btc by time of split..
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:18:44
Prob not. You have to check which wallet/wxchange supports it
