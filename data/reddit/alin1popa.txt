Many quantum-resistant algorithms have been developed. You could have a look at the list of post-quantum encryption algos that NIST has been trying to push, following its algorithm creation competition.
Bitcoin can and will definitely adapt, although that will involve making drastic changes to current hashing algorithms. I believe all current equipment (ASICs etc) will become obsolete after this change, but who knows - time will tell

To be fair there's no issue with the statement "Bitcoin is based on thin air", it's the "unlike the dollar" that is wrong

Agree on both, although for the average person both would probably fall within the "thin air" category, as neither of them is a tangible, physical, valuable, easy to understand, limited-quantity asset (as most people view gold and the economy).

Can you elaborate?

I can elaborate:
1. Money is worthless by itself
2. Money adds value to a society by allowing members to use it among them to exchange products and services
3. Money not used for exchanging things is therefore not adding value to society
4. People are inherently greedy
5. Being greedy, people have a natural tendency to store money and not use it
6. Money stored and not used is not adding value to society
7. Thus, greedy people that store money instead of making it circulate through the economy need an incentive to spend their money in order to add value to society
8. Inflation is that incentive
But obv inflation has to be in balance with all the above - e.g. a society where people never store their money does not need inflation at all, but that's not happening in the real world
