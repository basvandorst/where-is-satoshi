You spelled hold incorrectly.

This will be what drives the adoption of cryptos like Bitcoin.  The $ becomes so tainted, so abused by the government that the best course is to abandon it and redefine value.  This was the idea from the start.

You bought 1.5 btc worth of gold and asked someone else to hold it for you?  In Dubai?  Seems legit.

Yes, this is not a practical problem, now.  Today, robbers demand cash, jewels, etc.  There is very little reward vs. risk in going after bitcoin by force, today.
In this thought experiment I'm imagining a future where (almost) everyone carries a wallet.  Will it be easier to steal by force in this situation or does something like multisig with a remote 3rd party offer protection against this kind of theft?  Think about a place like a large city in a developing society, where everyone carries coin and the law is sparsely enforced... how will these folks protect themselves and their coin assets?

This is cash my man - electronic cash.  You have to think about it in this way.  The genesis of the tech is that people were looking for ways to replicate a cash-based system of transacting with all that this brings - anonymity, instant reconciliation, trust, etc.
The beauty of *this* tech is that it does all of that without the central banking authority required by FIAT.  So, if the idea of using cash to transact on a global scale, electronically, instantly, without the need for a central banking authority or government, appeals to you, then you can begin to see where this may lead and what the overall appeal is.
@_date: 2014-09-25 02:21:40
Does it?  That's the question.  Can you explain how it does when, in the future, most people carry a wallet?
@_date: 2017-02-06 12:11:58
He did explain it to you.  Nobody knows where the price will be at any given time.  You cannot time the market.  Buy when you can and hodl.

That's the irony here: he's killed SV in this process.  To raise a fraction of the capital he needs he'll have to flood the market with SV, which will kill it off.

You can't get your bitcoins out of Robinhood.  There are no bitcoins to withdraw.  Convert your holdings to USD and take your money out.  Buy bitcoin somewhere else.

No, what qualifies you as a moron is your generalization that "most people" believe something that isn't true.  Unfortunately, it means you're also delusional.  Bad news for you, I'm afraid.  Leave the forward thinking to those of us who understand these issues a bit more deeply.  You'll feel better about yourself.
@_date: 2017-11-02 14:53:27
If you are hodling, any time is a good time to buy.
We're a few years away from understanding what the real valuation of BTC is.  This is not mainstream, yet.  The broader market does not know what this is, at this time.
Buy now, pledge to sit on it for 5 years.

Yes Weedsmoker4hunnid20, your dad is right!  We're still early in the game, here.  Just about anything *could* happen.

Forgetting about the price of Bitcoin for a few years.  It doesn't matter.
@_date: 2017-10-24 19:21:01
No, I didn't. 
This is a consumer protection issue.  Without the law, these terms can be buried in legalese.   You should look up the definition of that word; it implies exploitation.  This law is meant to protect against exploitation of consumers.  It is not meant to absolve people from having to understand agreements they enter, as you describe.
Do you understand the culture from which bitcoin came to be?  Bitcoin was (still is) reactionary against an unfair and exploitative financial class.
@_date: 2017-10-24 17:46:54
No, they want to overturn a rule which prohibits them from burying binding arbitration clauses into agreements for financial services. 
You have your lawyer read every line of the agreement before you sign up for a credit card, right?  Actually, no one does, and so this law was meant to protect consumers who act reasonably and in good faith.
Stick with bitcoin.
