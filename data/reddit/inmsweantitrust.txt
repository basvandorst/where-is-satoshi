I know BFL specifically had issues with power consumption/heat and I remember them saying there definitely will be some variance between actual shipped products as well, but if mine hit's 80c I'm getting external cooling.

That's definitely plausible.  People have a lot invested in USD, even entire institutions built around a singular currency; everywhere I look, I see people who only want to keep the status quo; except of course here on :)

My thoughts:
* You can create transactions with no transaction fee and while miners don't have an incentive to process it, I would hope it would get included in the blockchain eventually.  I'm not as familiar with bitcoin mining concerning transaction fees as I'd like to be.
* The other side to this is this is expected; there will be private keys lost forever and coins in wallets that will never leave them that contribute to a deflation of the currency, which is not necessarily a bad thing.  I liken it to people losing real money, or it getting destroyed in one way or another, but the thing to remember is while we're on this blockchain, there is an upper limit to the amount of bitcoins in circulation.

Well, it appears some users [are getting their chips]( at least.  Keep in mind, these orders were placed in June, 2012.

Great article for the most part, but...


Please point us to your concerns, Nicholas.  Show us how you have compromised the blockchain or how giving economic value to a virtual currency is any crazier than giving value to a diamond, block of gold or a work of art.

[disclaimer: I ordered one of these a while back]  At best, BL is optimistically inept, at worst it's the most convoluted scam in history.  Either way, it's nice to see the possibility of a return on my investment.
@_date: 2013-05-09 11:47:58
I've always maintained that BFL were just inept and from what I see, that's kind of how it's been playing out.  Consider what happens when BFL keeps us in the loop:
* "Okay so you got the wafers back but when am I getting my damn unit?!"
* "Okay so you shipped some units to the press but when am I getting my damn unit?!"
Consider what happens when BFL keeps quiet:
* "BFL haven't updated their forum in a week, they're obviously cutting and running at this point"
* "BFL has the wafers but haven't started shipping, they're obviously mining with our units"
It seems like no matter what they do, whether or not they're legitimate, people will be exceptionally harsh on them.  I knew back in March that at best, I probably wouldn't receive my miner in the year 2013.  I was okay with that, and still am.  Bitcoin miners aren't the only way to make bitcoins; accepting bitcoin as payment for goods and services is another (exceptionally easier) way.

Hacking is a balance between one side's investment over another's, kind of like an arms race where instead of nukes it's dollars/time.  On our side, we have things like OSes bombarded for years and gradually strengthened through "trial-and-error", publicly vetted encryption and open source software, and other controls such as firewalls, antivirus and so forth.  On "Their side" they will have anywhere from nearly zero resources to nearly unlimited, depending on who "they" are.  So if we're talking about a single dude in Brazil, if he wanted to get into most normal people's systems he couldn't, at least without detection/social engineering.  If we're talking about the NSA or the state of China, they could almost definitely get into any one system they wanted, and they might be able to do it without being detected.  They will have to invest much more than what a single dude in Brazil could.
To answer your question more directly, I feel that "the defaults" are actually pretty good*.  I know there are probably some compromising pieces of code on some of my systems somewhere that an attacker aware of this code could use to get in, but they aren't as likely now as any other time in history.  Nowadays, most exploits are caused by sloppy coding, not deliberate "backdoors", because if you put a backdoor in a product, someone will reverse engineer your product, find it, and extort you for money, sell it on the black market or go public with it and hurt your business (see HP recently).  The "new thing" I feel is poorly implemented crypto, which can be a sort of a backdoor because as the makers of Cryptocat recently learned, good crypto implemented incorrectly is bad crypto.
*One point I'd like to make is early adopters.  New technologies tend to have security holes, so "the defaults" being enough really only apply to years-old technology, like current-gen wifi that has been through a lot of revisions to make "the default" more secure (look up WEP hacking if you're unfamiliar)
**TL;DR**: Do the basics like have a firewall, don't download files from untrusted sources and use antivirus and you will probably be safe.  Read up about NetSec (maybe check out MIT's free courses) and hang out with us on if you want to learn more/be safer.

That's awesome! Is there any way this could be scripted so we can watch the market share from day-to-day? Maybe something like this already exists?
@_date: 2013-05-09 21:23:07
Oh no don't get me wrong, they're definitely failing on a few fronts but I think it may be safe to say its probably not a scam.

Just wanted to show you folks how the media still perceives bitcoin.  Most of the issues they raise are rather laughable, such as we shouldn't use it because the creator is pseudo-anonymous (he doesn't mention the fact that the entire system is open-source), or that mt.gox used to trade magic cards before bitcoin (remember when Nintendo used to just make playing cards?) but others are very real (such as the prevalence of malware with the specific intent of stealing wallets if bitcoin starts to gain more of a widespread use).  I just wanted to see what you fine folks thought.

If you want this to be done, make sure to post a comment on the article, Ars makes money by publishing popular stories and BFLs if nothing else will definitely be popular.

I believe that you are incorrect; although I do not know the workings of the bitcoin protocol intimately, according to [this link]( a transaction can include up to 120 bytes of arbitrary data.  Also, see [this post]( for more examples.

I still want to see the transaction fees lowered.

There have been fluctuations in value of, for example, the dollar ("back in my day you could get two loaves of bread for..."), mostly I was lamenting because instead of using goods and bitcoin together to determine bitcoin's true value, we're still determining bitcoin's value against other currencies. The exchange rate changes constantly for the dollar, but I pay the same price day in and day out at any given fast food joint for the same thing, and I want bitcoin to be the same way.

I think this might be the only comment we need here. Maybe we should add it or something like it to the sidebar as we get more visitors to the sub asking similar questions?
@_date: 2013-04-11 23:01:48
I think the important takeaway from this article isn't that bitcoin is surely the future and that this will end up being a hilarious example of people not "getting with the times", but a great example that having a closed mind about new opportunities will exclude you from the potential benefits.  Will bitcoin persevere? Will it be litecoin? Will it be a next-generation cryptocurrency in lieu of bitcoin? No one can know the answers until we reach the future, but those who scoff and dismiss new ideas will surely miss out on investing in them.

* wasting bitcoin: A transaction can be created with any bitcoin amount you want, so you could theoretically create an unlimited number of transactions with only one satoshi to start off with.
* Program to rebuild the data: see [this link]( which references a program that already exists to extract the data.

Submitted a steam ticket and emailed Gabe; we'll see if either provide fruitful results.
@_date: 2013-04-26 16:20:46
One idea I had that I don't even know how it would work is that we could "restart" the blockchain by using a large-bit hash of the current blockchain and use it to create a new one that only includes accounts that have a balance and that's what miners and people who want to include the "full" blockchain use.  It's mostly a band-aid because that won't stop people from including illegal data in the blockchain and it could introduce problems as people try to use legitimiate extra data in the blockchain.
EDIT: because I was curious, [here]( is an example of an illegal number in the blockchain.

Well, I can't say for sure it's not a scam because at any point BFL could cut and run but the fact that they have started shipping units out to reporters and the first in line suggests that they actually have a product and it's not vaporware.
