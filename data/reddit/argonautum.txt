Mt Gox's lack of control with their holdings and transactions are just another aspect of Bitcoin's volatility. It is the same as a central government falling victim to a coup and shutting down; currency devalued or worse, changed. I get that MtG's assets were hacked and stolen. Without more stringent security protocols in place it still makes Bitcoin a VERY volatile financial vehicle. I'm not saying don't invest, I'm saying to understand that Btc has risk and invest only up to the level of your risk tolerance. 
Right now Btc is in its infancy and there will be a lot of bumps and bruises to investors, like the MtG debacle. As Btc matures and more sophistication on both sides of the transaction is understood, we will see less and less of these sorts of scenarios. Tremendous reward has been had by those early adopters, but it isn't without risk.
Great discussion.

I am sorry for your financial loss. The unique investment opportunity of Bitcoin is a added level of volatility we haven't had in investments for awhile. Or just a new game to play. Balancing your portfolio based on risk tolerance is always wise. I suppose I could say don't be emotional about money, but let's face it people are and can be. My only advice is "money is a tool". Good luck and I know you will recover your losses.

Would credit or leveraging BTC have to happen? If the limit is the blockchain would a secondary market with parallel chains have to be built with an exchange serving as an intermediary?

Shorting however has no limit on what you can lose theoretically. If you short a position and that position rises and never falls and splits etc. your loss is ridiculously huge.

Thank you. Excited for Entropy. Well, the device. The law... I guess given a long enough time line death rate is somewhere near 100%ish. So I got that going for me. Which is nice. Haven't caddy'd for the Lama yet to receive total consciousness.
