Let's be honest, cash is generally  terrific (as far anonymity in person  transactions), banks are horrible.
Demonetisation in India woke up a lot of people in the developing world to how the fed (doesn't matter which one) can collab with the government to pull ridiculous stunts to force people's money to be worthless.
And that's why crypto has got so important over there.
Crypto, gold, cash I don't have a problem with any of them, it's just cash can be stripped of its value instantly which has made it less of a standard of value now.
I can see big finance sectors wanting to hasten the demise of physical cash because then that gives them more control over the common man

Buffet doesn't have to be right 100% of the time, just 55% of the time.
He missed the technology boat but got coca cola right.
So bitcoin may be in the area in which he's wrong in

Don't send me 0.1 btc because you were an early investor and have more money than you know what to do with and no way to get it all out without alerting the IRS or the student debt people that want to take a chunk of your change before you even cash your earnings

That's not my advice, stole it from a wall street bankers blog that was bullish on crypto long before most people were.
They actually exited wall street last year because they know how much displacement crypto will have on  institutions

Financiers are pragmatic, they see it as competition. A total extinction level event for them. So they're going to do the next best thing. Make their own crypto. One Downside of bitcoin is that I see the old guard using this as an excuse to declare war on cash. Which was also a relatively anonymous medium of exchange (and why they want to kill it off) 
@_date: 2017-12-17 01:43:51
Yes I would like to know this as well. Especially for UK people

Someone should just make a rating system of all the exchanges based on user reports and reviews. That this hasn't been done yet is mindboggling

The issue I'm thinking about is repatriating any profits if we sell some 5 years later.
Like I see bitcoin as an awesome hedge against brexit and how hard the pound is going to sink post eu exit.
If we get to as crazy as 100,000 per btc how on earth do we take that money out and do right tax wise when literally every tax and banking institution wants to milk you dry with fees and costs when you live.
Not to mention the wary as fuck compliance officers about how you got your money

I had a chat with my friend who is a PhD and  was very involved with crypto and had some Acquaintances at uni that became bitcoin millionaires.
He was telling me that the underlying fundamentals of bitcoin specifically are Horrendous but that altcoins that have better fundamentals are losing to Bitcoin due to all the new money sloshing about from new dumb money  people wanting to X  return on  their investment and only really knowing bitcoin. It's based on beliefs rather than usage as a currency. 
If bitcoin was to go down significantly  it would take  down the value of a most of the altcoins with it.
Its why financial investors talk up bitcoin so much even if they don't have it. If more people invest in bitcoin, the value of Etherium and litecoin go up as well. 
Then they can sell their own coin and say they are divesting assets for the good of the community or some bullshit. 
Most of crypto currently is just about people timing the bubble and who is left with the empty bag at the end when all the dumb money runs away after bad news/high volatility. 
So then the question becomes, which crypto has good fundamentals and will increase in value and then mainstream adoption in the medium and long term   even if there's a huge bitcoin and altcoin pop?
And that's the trillion dollar question

Also did the charities sell their btc at the peak price or has their value declined now?
Thanks again for all you did man

So to avoid short term cap gains on each individual purchase and having to remember what price you buy them at, it seems easier to buy a ton in one go. The downside being a volatile price means you never know if you got in at a good value

Awesome! I wanted to do dollar cost averaging but i don't earn money evenly through out the year and didn't want to file multiple points of when i bought  bitcoin because there is a change of tax and capital gains  considerations that come with what what part of bitcoin you withdraw at what time
