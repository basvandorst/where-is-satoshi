actually bitcoin cash will be scaling to 32mb some time this week. its  been tested with massive gig blocks. thats only the half of it. The problems you see with bch is all crap. lies.

which link? eric? this is not trolling. simply exposure
@_date: 2017-12-16 00:07:42
big blocks are not centralised if competition for mining is encouraged. its very hard for a miner to own more than 50%
@_date: 2017-12-16 13:34:50
Thank you Eric for coming out with the truth!
@_date: 2017-12-14 14:18:20
they announced full adoption of bitcoin cash. blochain.info now has bitcoin cash fully implemented. So i can answer all the concerns of this post buy saying there is no issue. Bigger blocks is bitcoin cash. smaller blocks is bitcoin core. and there is no single entity that has any control. Visa is now a utility used on the bitcoin cash chain. like an exchange, only inside a card. Im sorry to tell you the reality, but There is no need for bitcoin core anymore. Greed has taken its soul.

it was tested to above 300gig at a home. an insane internet connection is required. but tested 300+gig block is possible at a house.

you must not be reading anything then, this is a copy and paste from the link i sent..     
Bitcoin ABC implements the Bitcoin Cash protocol. Miners can choose the size of the blocks they want to mine, and node operators can choose the size of blocks they will accept, with default block size limit of 8 MB.

Miners can choose the size of the blocks they want to mine, and node operators can choose the size of blocks they will accept. a node operator can be anyone. but useless to a home computer. if you have 20k go out and buy some equipment and mine something worthwhile.

it seems there is a shift for the truth. and i believe Bitcoin will become bitcoin again. which is essentially what bitcoin cash is. if ppl believe it or not its their choice. it wont change the truth of this video

it is not a scam, you are in a toxic space that will do what it takes to try take down anyone who does not agree with their "views" i must be careful what i say because they auto ban on words like c.e n/s/or s.h?ip. the app is free to use and is a great easy app. u may use it for bitcoin or bitcoin cash the choice is yours.

impossible to lose funds.  c.e n/s/or s.h?ip lies at the heart of r/bitcoin. you must not be fooled by the shills and trolls that lie in here as they try to own bitcoin and your wallet with big transaction fees. bitcoin cash is bitcoin with fast transactions and low fees. just like it used to be before blockstream hijacked it.

so ask your self, why would you want to be on a government's side? because you sound like his a threat to your superiors. fees, fast transactions, aiming to take on visa, master card.. his a threat to big banks, and who loves big banks? governments. and i bet all this trolling against him is part of the plan. how much you get paid? 0.00001 segwit? i wonder how much you pay back in fees?

Segwit is an intention move to destroy it! and you people are buying it!! the problem is replay protection.
Bitcoin Cash includes strong 2 way protection, such that users and exchanges are protected, because Bitcoin Cash transactions are invalid on Bitcoin and Bitcoin transactions are invalid on Bitcoin Cash. In contrast, SegWit2x (B2X), does not include such protection, this is likely to cause mass loss of funds for users and exchanges.
Bitcoin Cash had a new downward difficulty adjustment, this made the Bitcoin Cash block header invalid according to Bitcoin’s rules. Mobile wallets therefore need to upgrade to follow the Bitcoin Cash chain. In contrast, the SegWit2x block header will be considered valid by existing mobile wallets, this could cause chaos, with wallets switching from chain to chain or following a different chain to the one their transactions occurred on.
Since SegWit2x doesn’t have safety features, that ensure both coins can seamlessly exists side by side, it is considered by many as a hostile attack on Bitcoin, without respecting user rights to use and trade in the coin of their choice. In contrast Bitcoin Cash does respect user rights and is therefore respected by almost all sections of the Bitcoin community and not regarded as hostile. the destruction of bitcoin is funded from state level! us military manipulating social media... like i said at the beginning, Segwit is an intention move to destroy it! and you people are buying it.

Concerns raised by Bitcoin Core contributors and Bitcoin community members about the Segwit2x proposal have not been adequately addressed by its proponents. The details of the proposal were established before Bitcoin’s Segregated Witness activation, and before the recent creation of the BCH currency. It is irresponsible to ignore the outcome of these events when planning for the future. As an example, we’ve seen the confusion that arises when a single address is valid across two chains, yet the Segwit2x proposal intends to repeat the same mistake. Furthermore, BCH’s implementation of strong replay protection provided significant protection to users of both BCH, as well as Bitcoin, something Segwit2x does not plan on providing.
“I don’t believe a second, compatible implementation of Bitcoin will ever be a good idea. So much of the design depends on all nodes getting exactly identical results in lockstep that a second implementation would be a menace to the network.” — Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcointalk (2010)

no worries. i have plenty more material..

just you, from the things ive watched/read. Roger has been doing the opposite, or whatever is required that is equal to balance the volume of transactions on bitcoin cash. 
this is essentially in situ to Satoshi's white paper. :O

which after Adam Backs leaks and rectifications on twitter, i would say blockstream wont end up being used by many.. Blockstream and core's partnership are completely compromised, Adam even went as far as to say what their agenda is on r/bitcoin. So, at the end of the day, if i had a choice to follow a coin based on what goes on behind the scene, and what their consensus is, I would no doubt not be with core/stream. i expect csw to crush them by developing things on BCC that corestream could only dream about. just like the way BCC has scaled so large, it has proven to handle 1gig blocks, ultimately shaming the capabilities of visa. i believe everything CSW posts. His not a paid robot.
