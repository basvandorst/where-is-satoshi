On top of that he had tweeted ltc was headed for a bear phase right after it blew up. I don't own any ltc, but if I did I would be wary. For me personally, I like to see someone stand by their product by using it. 
It could be nothing, but it just smells a little fishy to me. Someone mentioned that he might have been asked to dump it by a potential employer. That would make sense if true.

There was only long delays cuz so many people were trying to send them at once and they got overloaded. With the sudden popularity of crypto they have not been able to keep up with the amount of new users. They are swamped with work and this is normal for a growing business. They just grew wayyy too fast.

But you can share tweets on Reddit also and discuss them...

Hell yes it is!

I agree. Much more digestable number for people.

 Anyone can be a day trader /s
@_date: 2017-12-14 19:11:35
Everyone making more money than me boo hoo. 
Blame the system, not the people making money. And crypto is probably the solution to fix the system. IMO there is a much bigger impact that crypto will bring to the world than some people making some money trading.

I think litecoins success has a lot to do with the fact that they are on the coinbase app which is the most popular right now for acquiring crypto. I think people dont really know what crypto is so they go in coinbase and see Bitcoins price and are thrown off by such a high number so they go for the cheap one. Also they are saying that ltc is faster and has lower fees, which i think is only due to not as many people using it.
I'm hoping once people understand crypto, they will realize that litecoin has nothing to offer that Bitcoin doesn't already do and it will die.

No, I think everything is dropping a bit since people wanted to get their hands on some bch in anticipation of the coinbase bump to make a few bucks. And they haven't even dropped that low. People really need to chill. When you guys freak out like that, it makes bitcoin look weak. If you really believe in this technology and movement, then don't sweat that stuff. Who cares what others are doing. Realize that yes there are some people here just to get rich and that's ok, they are helping crypto become more popular in the bigger picture.

Creator of LTC tweeted that he dumped all of his coin. I would consider that drama-ish...

You didnt have to go to GDAX but you had to enlarge the picture in the tweet to see what was going on. 
You're welcome, glad I could help!

You think they want to help the transition from their FIAT currency? And I don't understand why we would want countries accumulating BTC. I want people to accumulate it. I think the battle has just begun to become "here to stay" for crypto.

It's the early days of adoption for the mainstream

Instead of sitting around or complaining, why don't you pick up a keyboard and a computer and start working on solutions for these problems yourself. Scalability is being talked about constantly and there are numerous developers working on it already. I'm sure even visa did not process as many transactions in the beginning as they do now. This is cutting edge tech that will change the world, and Rome wasn't built in a day. Some patience and faith will go a long way. If you really believe in the technology then you should be fine waiting a bit. I for one am just happy to be witnessing history in the making.

Yes governments are made of people but they don't always act in the best interests of the people. IMO all governments need to fall and I hope bitcoin will accomplish this. People will suffer short term and my hope is other people would quickly step up and help each other. Then we can rebuild something great.
I'd prefer peaceful hand over as well, I just don't think it's likely to happen peacefully with money and power on the line.

And people are forgetting that there are some very wealthy people that own some Bitcoin. Sure futures could mean downward pressure on the price of Bitcoin, but there are whales protecting their investment. Like when the Winklevoss twins were daring people to put their money where their mouth was and short Bitcoin.

On the bottom graph in the chart, you can see a big red jump at 17,250 often referred to as a sell wall. The bottom graph represents the number of buy/sell orders there currently are. If you mouse over the chart it tells you how much the order would be worth.

Only time you have to worry about counterfeits in crypto is if you own bitcoin cash lol
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:10:20
That's how I see it too. And if I held any ltc I would be extremely nervous.

You can set your sell price on an exchange so if the price goes above what you set it at it will sell automatically. OP is saying there is $20,000,000 currently for sale at that price, and you can change your limits at any time. Which means for the price to go above that all of those open sell orders would have to be sold in order for the price to jump above that. There are some "bluffs" on there though to where if you start buying through a sale order they will move it up to a higher price cuz they did not actually want to sell.
