You need to have a minimum of 100 XRD to withdraw, and from what i heard XRB transfers are pretty much instant!

That would be worth more like $750,000 today.

I’m guessing your from America not England, but my regional council have recently announced plans to close down our leisure Center. The local parish council are looking around desperately for sponsors to build a new one so the kids will have somewhere to learn to swim and everything like that!
Another thing is to donate to the struggling families, we were made aware of 4 families with 8 children that have literally nothing this year for Christmas. We pulled together the community, and have made some nice donations for Christmas but there are thousands like this.
Finally, the homeless. I always like to make packages (toothpaste, dry soap, deodorant, vouchers for local food, fresh socks etc) and hand them out, you would be amazed how many homeless there are.
Whatever you do, well done. The world could use more people like you!

Thanks for the replies, and yeah i understand why the fee's are high but in all honesty its the first time that i've actually tried moving any BTC and was shocked! I excpected (knowing that fees were high) that it would be around 10% i didnt realise how bad it actually was at the minute!
Iv been buying bits for a while, so have lots of smaller transactions which makes it even worse!

I cancelled it, no one in there right mind would pay that.
Its like the credit card company asking for a £75 fee for a £100 purchase!

If you can’t afford to lose it then don’t gamble.
