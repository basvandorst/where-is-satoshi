I'm the owner Hedge Fund BTC list today in BitcoinBourse ticker HFB and Hedge Fund LTC list today in LitecoinInvest ticker HFLTC (
Today BitcoinBourse change terms for merchants. I consider than are unacceptables.
For this reason I study any solution for BitcoinBourse shareholders.
If BitcoinBourse don't reconsiders her new maintenance fees perhaps we need to any of this:
- Migrate to any other exchange.
- Convert shares to private shares.
- Convert BitcoinBourse shares (HFB) to LitecoinInvest shares (HFLTC).
Don't worry. I pay weekly dividends normally.
Thanks for your comprension.

WEEKLY DIVIDEND
You can expect tomorrow Monday 23 Jun 2014 next weekly dividend. For Hedge Fund LTC wil be 0.00019 LTC. For Hedge Fund BTC will be 0.000019 BTC.
How you know main earnings are thanks my BTC-EUR trade on LocalBitcoins. It would be interesting to move more money (aprox 5 BTC or 200 LTC). With this money could increase weekly dividend considerably. With actual share prices profitability is up 100% year.
If any want private BTC investments please contact me. Minimum is 0,10 BTC = 100 shares Hedge Fund BTC. Now I work for to list Hedge Fund BTC in any exchange. When I obtain it it's possible migrate private shares to new exchange.
Thanks for your support.

Today (15-Jun-2014) BitcoinBourse stop trade HFB (Hedge Fund BTC).
Changed terms for merchants. Want earn fee 1 BTC/month. I consider than is unacceptable.
BitcoinBourse say than I can't pay 1 BTC/month.
Hedge Fund BTC say than BitcoinBourse sell shares loss than 1 BTC/month. With this sales is one unjustified rate.
For this reason I offer this solutions for BitcoinBourse shareholders:
- Migrate to any other exchange. I work for this. I hope than early we can do it.
- Convert shares to private shares. If you have more than 100 shares it's possible to pay directly to bitcoin adress.
- Convert BitcoinBourse shares (HFB) to LitecoinInvest shares (HFLTC).
Don't worry. I pay weekly dividends normally.
Tomorrow Monday you can expect next weekly dividend: 0.000019 BTC/share.
Thanks for your comprension.
