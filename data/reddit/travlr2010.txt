I have read this somewhere. 
I'm not sure why it's not prominently featured on the home page of bitcoinfoundation.org though.
If they (the foundation) are to be the voice of Bitcoin, shouldn't they be a little more proactive in getting these statements out? I heard about gox suspending BTC withdrawls, then Bitstamp doing the same, before this came out. 
Isn't one exchange enough of an issue to warrant a response? Or does it take this long to identify the problem and formulate an appropriate response?
Are these people full time employees or do they have day jobs that require their attention as well?

If you leave your coins in an exchange like MtGox and it disappears, that's your mistake. Personally holding bitcoin paper wallets is fairly easy. A little research goes a long way. 
And on the inflation front, just wait a bit. What is the FED's response when inflation hits? They lower interest rates. Where are interest rates now? How are they going to lower them from here? QE is being tapered as we speak. 
Excuse me I have to go buy some bitcoin.

At this point it looks like just a novelty, and there are other ways to pay, but two of the brick and mortar places that accept bitcoin currently offer a 10% discount. So if you're shopping there, you get your money back instantly. 
On the other hand, if you want to buy a small amount of bitcoin and don't want to go through the KYC/AML stuff with a major exchange, this is a good way to go. 
If you're shopping online, for instance, or wiring money overseas to relatives, this is a great way to get BTC fast, without a bank account or a utility bill in your name.

Companies like Wells Fargo started off building safes that people used to keep valuables, including cash, well ... safe. 
Personal responsibility for valuables is difficult the bigger and more difficult to hide those valuables are. Bitcoins are very easy to keep safe with a combination of paper wallets, encrypted USB drives, the Trezor hardware wallet coming soon, and others. 
Just searching YouTube for wallet security will give you an hour's worth of decent to excellent advice on keeping your Bitcoin safe from hackers and thieves if you don't want to go to the arduous effort of using the search feature here on Reddit and reading it for yourself.

My point is MtGox isn't a bank. And AFAIK, not even insolvent. But people don't even leave their long term holdings in NYSE or NASDAQ, because that's what brokerage firms are for. They provide security for assets in exchange for fees unless you opt to hold the certificates yourself.

Copypasta for the lazy:
The Commission has a policy of encouraging innovation. Virtual currencies are an area of innovation which the Commission continues to monitor closely while recognising that there are currently significant risks associated with them. In the light of those risks, the Commission will adopt a cautious approach and may well refuse applications to register financial services business where the use of virtual currency is involved. However, this approach will be regularly reviewed in the light of international developments.

Name one stock that you can HOLD in an account at the NYSE.
I am looking at bitcoin as a commodity, I'm saying you can be your own broker instead of paying fees to Wall Street by holding your bitcoin yourself so that if one exchange goes down, you don't lose anything. You can still sell your bitcoin on another exchange.

We've gotten a little off topic here, but OK.
Banks were "encouraged" by every President since Carter to expand the base of home owners. 
That meant loosening underwriting requirements. But it didn't matter since housing hadn't had a negative growth quarter since the great depression.
So with those orders loan programs were expanded. 
I'm not saying there weren't some bad actors in the private sector, but the regulators share in the blame as well. 
@_date: 2014-04-02 07:58:12
Sounds like you're familiar with the operations of gas stations. Do you know local regulations about how pumps are certified? In most places, pumps must be inspected periodically. My best guess is that this is for accurate reporting of flow rates. If that's all it is, you should be good to go. If it's anything more, you will need to be prepared. I'd love to hear about the inspection process once you get one installed. Make sure the security cameras aimed at that unit are high Res and have sound recording. I predict YouTube gold with that conversation.

Good synopsis of some of the "Best of" press clippings for Bitcoin, but he didn't go very far out on the limb to say that the platform will be significant at some point in the distant future.

If you are actively trading bitcoin on an exchange, you don't very likely have ALL your bitcoin involved. Losing one trade shouldn't bankrupt anyone. 
This assumes that the exchange goes from being healthy one second and dead the next as if someone just pulled the plug. In the case of MtGox, trading there has been known to be risky for some time. So, yeah, if you lose by trading on MtGox, that's on you at this point. But you should only lose what you would normally have in one trade, not your entire holdings.
Because exchanges are not banks. 
@_date: 2014-02-21 16:37:45

Maybe some enlightened studio exec will want to distribute coupons for discounted movie tickets for anyone who pays for a torrent of a movie. 
Cinema receipts are still solid when a movie is good. Look at American Sniper. The politics surrounding it helped a bit, but overall, to set a record like it did, there is a huge overlap between people who saw it via torrent and people who saw it in a cinema. 
What other "add on services" would people be willing to pay for?

@_date: 2015-01-22 13:59:49
It's great that you are looking for a way to get the studios involved.
I think the studios will have to keep this model in mind throughout the process of making movies. 
One way for studios to monetize torrented content is to use a "bug" like your local TV station does during your favorite show. That semi-transparent logo in one corner of the screen that your mind automatically ignores after seeing it not move for the first 45 seconds or so of watching something. That is some very valuable screen "real estate" and TV producers are waking up to it. Watch it next time you see a sports replay. It will likely turn into a corporate logo of a sponsor of the coverage of the match. 
Another way is product placements. Movie producers are very familiar with this, but it has a bad name among pure arteests (sic). They will have to get over their bad selves and befriend corporate sponsors before they start filming their next masterpiece. 
But the best way is to do what we're discussing here, create a direct payment channel between the viewer and the producers. Without this, big budget films will go the way of the dinosaur and people will be saying "This (piracy) is why we can't have nice things."

Excellent point. Nationalism is widely cited as a major driving power of Trump's campaign. But I think it's more about a deep dissatisfaction with all politicians, including Ted Cruz. If Ted Cruz had used his convention speech as his stump speech, this would have been a very different primary. Instead he played games and acted like an insider power broker. But I digress. 
Trump is definitely playing on Nationalism trends, but all politicians wrap themselves in the flag and say "follow me". 
I don't think that Johnson would be able to implement an open border policy as envisioned by the most devout libertarians, even IF he wins.

You're essentially describing most versions of the "Fair Tax", which also include a "prebate card" which is loaded with the amount of taxes that a person earning poverty level wages (or some low income number) would pay.

There are multiple versions of the "FairTax", not all of them regressive. And the Libertarian candidates this year are likely to do a much better job than Hillary for sure, and would probably build a better cabinet to help them than Trump will. 
I just hope that they make it to the debates so that everyone can see them and what they stand for. I think this year we'll have record voter turnout, mainly people voting AGAINST either Democrats or Republicans. Given this choice, I think these guys have a solid chance to win and shrink the government in some key areas. They won't be able to enact their entire agenda any more than the other candidates will.
