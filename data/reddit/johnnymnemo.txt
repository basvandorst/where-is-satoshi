In light of Citizen's United, in which SCOTUS established that money = speech, I don't believe this would stand a SCOTUS challenge.  I'd be interested in a real lawyer commenting on this.
Never did I think that CU could be of benefit.

I admire your courage.  I hope, for the sanity of our Republic, it's not actually put to the test.

Snowden is a tax-deduct charity?  Even if it's arguably legal to give him money, claiming it on your taxes is a whole nother ballgame.

As a BTC newbie, I'd appreciate some help with this.  This is the most legitimate use I can think of for BTC.
I'm aware of the wiki page of BTC, but haven't followed it in some time and this would probably be my only immediate term use of the concept.  Can you give a newb a rundown on how one might best and safely conduct a transaction to donate to Snowden?

It does some things well, like anonymous transfers.  Also the transaction feeds are lower, so places like Kickstarter or other sites that use micropayments would benefit.
However, those markets are relatively small.  If and when I was interested in either of those, I would buy bt for that value.  Buying it to expect to sell it to others with that need is a gamble;  expecting that kind of need to grow faster than the rate of currency accumulation is an even longer shot.

What are the fundamentals?
