Ah. So rewards will halve to the point where we are mining half of a half of a bitcoin then half of that so on forever. Also measured in denominations these rewards will seem like more. In the future block rewards may be something like 50 bits instead of 50 bitcoins. This makes perfect sense now. I'm more confident in this tech now. Thanks.
Edit: never mind.  The block reward will eventually be reduced to 0 satashi. In order to get beyond 8 decimals the network would have to hard fork, which is very undesirable if not impossible for bitcoin.

Thanks.

Right. Backed by the strongest economy and protected by the us government.

Market cap is measurement of many different things: Business acceptance, ubiquity,  liquidity, confidence and trust in the tech. Also interesting to see how bitcoin stacks up against traditional equities. Too many meat heads in this sub.

Its simple; usd is considered a safety haven currency around the world because it is backed by the most powerful government on earth. People can easily perceive it's value. 
Bitcoin is a little more esoteric; really only techies understand that bitcoins value can be derived from its network strength, merchant adoption,  and power as a financial instrument.

To me technological adoption = People buy bitcoins. I guess you can contradict this assumption if you want to be pedantic, obtuse, etc.

I imagine a bulk of them were lost when bitcoin was in the 'neat' stage.
@_date: 2014-05-08 01:58:03
Excuse my ignorance. How does this create more bitcoins?

I never asked about worth. Go back and read my question. Actually,  fuck it. I don't need a worthless answer from someone who is more interested in flaming rather than making intelligible opinions.

Just asking for some informed speculation. Nothing more, nothing less. Thanks for your input.

If china was smart(or less afraid) they'd see a huge opportunity in crypto. If they supported the businesses and exchanges leading this revolution they could surely capitalize and create massive opportunity for their country and people.

Do you think the bitcoin network will ever adjust the block rewards so that at least one bitcoin can be mined?
@_date: 2015-08-24 23:39:55
Yes! this is what I'm looking for. Have huobi on my watch list now. Thanks a ton
@_date: 2015-08-24 22:21:58
Thanks. That's what my research is pointing to as well. :D

I'll probably just put it away and forget about it. I'm trying to avoid the obsession part too.

Ltc dump.

OP, that really sucks. Being a victim of theft is always an traumatic experience. When I was 17 I used to leave my wallet in the car with my doors unlucked? WTF. lol I just didnt care or worry. That didn't last long. 
I just really don't see you as a careless person. You were more cautious than the average bitcoin Joe. It's easy to go back and criticize weakpoints in your security but hindsight being 2020 I'm sure no one else could have seen this coming. Sometimes folks are just victims. 
I'm sure someone else will come along soon with a similar story. I really think that that mobile devices coupled with extra security layers is the future. 
Right now, in the state of arizona it is perfectly fine to present your proof of insurance with an E-card on your phone. I see us doing to the same thing with our drivers license. Banking and bitcoin. 
Coinbase, insurance companies, and mobile devices will make bitcoin palatable for the masses.

I think it's easy on the conscious to steal from faceless strangers over the Internet. kinda like finding a loaded wallet on the ground. 
In 4th grade I stole a buddies gameboy. Felt so friggin terrible for it. I put it in the closet and refused to play it for years.
