I did not now you could buy fractions until recently. If I had known things would be very different.

Is Coinbase secure or should I transfer to a personal wallet?

Ultimately it’s up to you and how much you want to risk selling and rebuying. You may end up having to buy higher then what you sold for if it rebounds too fast.

I’d still consider switching banks.

I paid $3 on Coinbase to transfer $250

Buying large quantities or selling large quantities at once to cause a panic and take advantage of the lower / higher prices.

I know that, but others may not understand that this happens in all markets.

I’d venture to say at this point there are no trends. It’s all uncharted so trying to predict anything is foolish.

What about old December?

Pretty sure you will have to transfer. This is also how Coinbase works. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 03:37:25
Not a bad idea

How is Gdax compared to Coinbase? I just started buying into bitcoin and am still trying to decide who I want to use. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:35:50
Supply and demand. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:23:12
I realize that now. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:32:45
Fees have increased with popularity
@_date: 2017-12-15 03:34:58
How many of the 21 million are actually usable. Some are lost forever 
@_date: 2017-12-09 00:42:27
If it drops buy low and even out your average cost. Don’t sell 
@_date: 2017-12-15 16:48:04
Get a job and be unpoor. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:27:35
Didn’t sell high enough. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:45:05
What does that mean?
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:25:34
Cash is ass
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:24:05
People selling and I’m buying
@_date: 2017-12-18 17:50:50
It was AI. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:50:19
Where do you see that?
@_date: 2019-11-09 06:09:22
Yes
