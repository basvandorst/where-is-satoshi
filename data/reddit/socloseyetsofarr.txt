Can someone please explain the significance of this and "Segwit" in potato terms? I'm a potato. Thank you.

that's a 50% return in a month. How did you do that? Mind sharing tips? I'm VERY new to this..

do you use zero knowledge cloud servers or something like icloud/google drive with 2-factor?

Ah yes..

Putting in $50-100 per week is doable but where do I put it.. I kind of am almost clueless about the process. The earning I mentioned in my original post were just me following video instructions off youtube..

What's happening on Dec 16?

Its own wallet system? I am expecting mine in a few days and that part of your post made me concerned about something. What if ledger stops updating/developing its app? What happens next? I also know that Ledgers can store many types of currency under one passphrase. How is that possible? Aren't we supposed to have a seed for every wallet inside of it? It almost feels like if Ledger sinks, all my currency will sink with it. 
I'd love to be corrected though..

Let's say that I have Ether, Litecoin, and Bitcoin and let's say that in the future, ledger ceases to exist and I find myself in a hypothetical position where my only choice to gain access back to my crypto is through MEW, Electrum-LTC, and Electrum. Do I use the same and one and only 24-word seed that the ledger spit out on each of these wallets to regain access? I highly doubt that that's the case.
My other concern is compatibility. Electrum for example deals with 12-word seeds while a wallet like MEW doesn't even use a seed as one of its access options. What do I do with the 24-word seed the ledger gave me then? Sorry if I sound very clueless but that's my assumption in the meantime..

I'm not sure what you're referring to when you say "fees", but how bitfinex works, i sort of leant my btc out of my funding wallet and got back the same amount + a payout equivalent to 2 USD.
How can I improve this? (sorry but I'm very new to this..)

Oh now I get you. Maybe I wasn't clear. I have no issues with buying bitcoin with fiat. What I'm asking about is how I can make my bitcoin generate more bitcoin like the case of margin trading. Margin trading is risky though so there's this alternative called margin funding that I'm using, but I just happened to find that the returns were almost nothing (about $52 a month). I was wondering if there's a better way to go on about this.

How would I be able to put in that much per week? I feel like I am missing something to be honest.
