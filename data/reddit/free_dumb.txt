Bad news still needs to get reported. Acting like it doesn't exist isn't a good way to go about it. 
@_date: 2014-02-03 20:59:21
Not trying to sound too harsh but isn't this an extremely bad idea? I lurk in this subreddit and have seen that a couple early bitcoiners have thousands of bitcoins right? So couldn't they crash the entire value of bitcoin if they wanted to? Or they could have their wallet stolen? 
@_date: 2014-04-09 15:26:44
Yeah I don't think you'll be able to convince most people on this sub but what your statement is completely true. Bitcoin is tied to the dollar. If the dollar collapses then so would bitcoin. No one would care about bitcoin if the dollar collapse in all reality. 
@_date: 2014-02-26 13:41:47
But you can keep it away from other people in a private wallet. 
@_date: 2014-11-25 14:44:12
A lawyer for a facebook post? Come on
@_date: 2014-03-14 19:07:43
It's value is that every single business in America is legally obligated to accept dollars. That gives it value. You never have to worry about businesses accepting dollars unlike bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-10-14 09:48:29
Yeah that's the whole point of the website. To get payed to be a walking billboard. 
@_date: 2014-02-03 16:14:17
I think the Oregon and New Jersey keep it legal and say it is so handicapped people who can't pump gas on their own can still go and get gas independently.

Eclipse the dollar? It will never replace the dollar or any currency. It's crazy you think that is at all possible. Bitcoin is decentralized which has it's pros and cons obviously. It will never take over a centralized currency. Most People want their assets safe and it is safe to have it in dollar. Not in a currency that can easily lose ten percent of it's value overnight. 
@_date: 2014-03-14 19:02:44
Yeah I was about to point this out. I'm surprised this has so many up votes. Bitcoin inflates and deflates faster than any major currency. 
@_date: 2014-10-13 11:30:50
Still obviously have to pay a monthly fee to bitpay which could actually end up costing the business if no one accepts Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-07-13 15:22:03
Those two situations aren't even comparable in the slightest. I can't tell if your serious. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 14:28:49
Yeah and that "bank" lost everyone's money that they were holding. Making people lose trust in exchanges but more importantly in bitcoin  itself. 
@_date: 2014-02-03 20:55:23
That's honestly just unbelievable that you wouldn't donate just because they don't accept bitcoins. A lot of companies simply are not set up to accept bitcoins at this point in time. If you actually wanted to donate that badly you would just donate dollars. 
@_date: 2014-05-29 14:35:04
Except bad news still makes the price drop. 
@_date: 2014-10-13 11:37:03
Why is it the merchant's fault if no one is spending in Bitcoin? 
@_date: 2014-02-03 21:02:57
So those people without credit cards buy bitcoins in cash/in person? 
@_date: 2014-02-26 13:43:44
Not op, but is that a serious question? Some people literally lost hundreds of thousands of dollars. That's insane. Yes they shouldn't have held all that in an exchange but a lot of people didn't think gox would be able to lose/steal all the bitcoins. 
@_date: 2014-03-04 04:17:13
Well... I agree with you. It seems pretty futile to try to argue with bitcoin enthusiasts. 
@_date: 2014-08-22 12:23:49
No he's talking about doing that to build fake rep. Then he would be able to send an incorrect answer to a real person and they would believe based on his rep. 
@_date: 2014-02-14 01:47:34
What website is good for checking on bitcoin price? 
@_date: 2015-05-01 12:10:13
Wow why don't you just stop critiquing this guy and start your own Bitcoin business? Like holy shit, private businesses have no need to publicly display their business plans. Which businesses do you know of that actually does that? 
@_date: 2015-05-15 18:42:23
I don't think fiat is going anywhere, but if it were like you were staying, then stocks in any country would become worthless. Every business runs on fist and if it become worthless, so would the entire economy that runs on it. 
@_date: 2015-08-01 23:18:27
Yup just a war on the poor. Not on cash, but bitcoiners are trying to make their own headline of a story, 
@_date: 2015-08-05 20:37:41
Yeah you got quite the classic reply. This subreddit really struggles with realizing that Bitcoin isn't some perfectly created currency. Long confirmation times, the fact that large amount of coins are held by a select few early adopters, and of course the fact that their is no ability to chargeback. The no chargeback feature is NOT consumer friendly at all, and something that will make widespread consumer adoption impossible IMO. Trusting a company to payback when they need to is an obviously broken system. 
@_date: 2015-08-06 17:05:38
Maybe missing some crucial info on your ITT hate train. I agree it's a shitty school, but you really got dropped from the class for being late to one meeting? I'm guessing you missed more than once and that the syllabus clearly outlined the number you can miss before being dropped. 
@_date: 2015-08-01 22:40:42
Funny your at -1. How else can a company still make a profit from giving you 25% off?
@_date: 2015-08-01 22:29:38
Even if he did do you really think he would publicly state it? 
@_date: 2015-04-27 19:09:35
Way more people use credit cards so obviously more theft is going to occur. Not sure what your point is. 
@_date: 2015-04-27 19:05:00
Yeah I'm not sure what these people are talking about. People only cold cop for hard drugs like heroin and crack, and that's only if all their connects are out and their desperate. The same people cold copping are not the ones who would wait on drugs to ship from an unknown location. 
@_date: 2015-04-29 17:33:42
Are you stating that taxation is the government stealing from citizens? Are you serious? If your american every single road, all the protection of police, fire departments, are all tax payer funded. 
@_date: 2015-09-18 20:22:45
Making six figures isn't considered rich to you guys? Seriously? Making a 6 figure salary puts you as some of the richest humans currently alive. Top 1% globally. 
@_date: 2015-04-27 22:55:07
Do you really think IBM is fudging numbers because their afraid of Bitcoin? No one "fears" Bitcoin. Banks don't. They really don't sorry to burst your bubble. 
@_date: 2015-03-12 00:57:16
Faith in their government is understanding the power of currency. The U.S. Dollar is backed by the government and legal tender to all debts in America legally, as well as a very common trade currency in other countries that have shitty currency. The dollar isn't nearly as weak as you bitcoiners make it out to be. Every business in America by law has to accept US currency. That's a lot of power that seems to be misunderstood on this subreddit. 
@_date: 2015-03-12 00:59:04
Yeah that silly american dollar has only been around for the existence of America, and yes I'm aware it's no longer backed by gold but my point still stands. This currency isn't going ANYWHERE anytime soon. 
@_date: 2015-10-13 17:31:55
What? How is this relatable at all to gerrymandering. Im genuinely curious. 
@_date: 2015-10-13 18:35:35
Or do. I don't give a shit about votes really. People probably thought I was being sarcastic or something. 
@_date: 2015-02-14 15:22:09
Perfect response haha. Good use of "arse" too.
@_date: 2015-02-13 16:23:11
This belongs in I hope your a troll. 
@_date: 2015-02-13 18:43:10
Yeah I understand those are separate city-states/territories. My question was to prove the financial abuse you claim, which you can't seem to do. 
@_date: 2015-02-12 21:45:01
Any sources for your bold claim?
