Gains are realized when you sell. That phrase “can’t lose money if you never sell” is especially true for taxes and applies to gains as well.
@_date: 2019-07-29 00:25:43
Yes, that is how living in a non-libertarian society works.
Alternative view: if you're not paying the taxes you owe, you're stealing from society everytime you use something paid for by taxes (roads, mail services, fire fighters, etc).
@_date: 2019-07-26 22:24:35
Legally, yes that counts as income.
Practically, no. The IRS doesn’t care about $100 and wouldn’t come after you about that. The cutoff for the recent letters was $20,000 bought/sold.
@_date: 2019-07-26 22:43:19
Yes, and since you were holding short term you’ll be paying short term capital gains rates rather than long term, which is equivalent to your federal income tax bracket.
Really it’s still up to the IRS. Technically, you are required to report and pay taxes on that UNLESS it’s offset by something like other losses or covered by the standard deduction. However, they might decide they don’t care about the ~$20 you’d have to pay on that $100 and just do nothing.
EDIT: you may also have to pay fees/fines/interest if these taxes are past due.

Are not aware of what taxes are? You're not paying the IRS because they deserve it, you're paying the IRS because that's what you owe the government.
@_date: 2019-07-26 22:45:56
Misread your post, it’s the net profit. It would be somewhere in the neighborhood of $20-30 due + any fees or fines for a late payment.
@_date: 2019-07-27 00:59:50
$20,000 in transactions, cumulative between 2013 and 2015. Likely that’s just because that’s all the data the IRS has currently, but they’ll certainly be getting 2015-Present eventually.

Undervalued by $2? I guess the price is pretty accurate then.

Surely you realize this isn’t a selling point for Bitcoin, because that will never be a result the average person can expect. Value has to come from somewhere, regardless if you’re taking fiat or bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-03-07 20:28:34


You’re proving his point. Comparing performance of two assets over a short 5-year time span is not a financially literate thing to do, first of all. Second of all, it’s much easier for a single small asset (Bitcoin) to double in value than the ENTIRE stock market (VTI). If you wanted a more apt comparison, then cherry pick the best performing asset from the VTI fund and compare its annual return to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-03-07 21:02:41
Five years is definitely not enough time to establish a true trend. Five years isn’t even a full market cycle. If you really do have a degree in a finance-related field, then you should be familiar with how many hedge fund managers are able to post very impressive % gains over short periods (years), yet virtually none of them can sustain those gains for more than a decade. The universe loves S curves.

What are you confused about?
@_date: 2019-03-07 20:51:54


Yes, and that’s not enough value to turn the average bitcoin investor into someone who can buy a house and a Lambo.


Complete 100% bullshit comparison. Comparing Amazon’s general purpose computing power to Bitcoin’s extremely specialized, ASIC-powered hashing power is not a valid comparison. Amazon has enough money to buy/develop enough ASICs to launch an indefinite 51% attack on Bitcoin if they wanted to. 
If you think this is a fair comparison, then here’s another: did you know if you combined all Bitcoin ASICS together they don’t have the computational power to train a single neural network that Amazon can train with 0.0001% of their total computing power?
@_date: 2019-03-08 16:55:32




Nope again. You have no idea what you're talking about. ASICs are not general purpose, they do exactly one specific calculation fast and nothing else. Bitcoin's mining network is inferior to AWS is every way EXPECT that it can calculate SHA-256 hashes faster. In every other metric, AWS wins.
It's always hilarious seeing people who don't even know how Bitcoin works acting like Bitcoin is untouchable.
@_date: 2017-01-07 09:43:53
This is the most important thing people need to keep in mind. There is always risk, and you shouldn't be risking money you can't afford to lose. Everybody who claims with certainty that Bitcoin or any other thing is going to the moon due to x, y, and z is 100% full of shit. If they really knew it, they wouldn't be telling anybody and would be opening every line of credit they possibly could to buy more.

Classic [gambler's fallacy](
@_date: 2016-12-23 21:14:35
Don't risk anything you can't afford to lose based on this prediction. There's always tons of predictions about every currency and stock. When you look at how well the predictions match reality, some of them will inevitable appear to be good matches. Is this because the author had some knowledge nobody else had? Maybe, but most of the time it's pure chance. When you take those same models that are currently looking good and come back to them a few months later, you'll see most of them failing.
TL;DR: Survivorship bias is real, and it doesn't mean the model is any good.

You could block it fairly easy with a firewall. IPTables or ufw are good options if you're on Linux. Then, you just need to IP ranges.

First, that’s not reclaiming energy, that’s simply using the waste heat as heat. Second, that’s not an energy efficient way to get heat in the first place, a heat pump is far more efficient. Third, this requires investing in the infrastructure to pump heat around a city / town / neighborhood, which isn’t cheap. Fourth, this assumes heat is actually useful where the crypto mining is occurring, which means this heat recycling technique is useless in warm climates or in most areas during the summer.
@_date: 2019-02-12 03:20:28
Now consider that a typical heat pump will have a comparable efficiency of 300%. For every 1kW you use with a heat pump, you get 3kW of thermal energy. Use 1kW on an ASIC, and you get 1kW of thermal energy. That’s why bitcoin mining is far less efficient at heating than using a heat pump.
@_date: 2019-02-11 21:50:58


No, heat is waste product. We have no good way to reclaim energy from waste heat. Not to mention the temperature gradients between bitcoin miners and room temperature are too small to be that useful for energy generation.

What I said holds true for Bitcoin as well.
@_date: 2019-01-22 05:39:15


This is simply, indisputably false based on historical data. Cryptocurrency, so far, has been a bad stable store of value.
@_date: 2019-01-22 20:17:07
Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency, and people like you who think it’s somehow elevated to some higher form are just drinking too much of the koolaid.
If those people disagree with me, then they have no idea what a value store is. Buyers between 2010-2016 have had their asset’s value fluctuate wildly and unpredictably, making bitcoin a bad value store. The fact that an asset has appreciated *so far* does not make it a good store of value. Just because beanie baby’s appreciated in value greatly for people who bought them before 1995 does not mean they’re a good value store.
@_date: 2019-01-22 17:44:24
You forgot the most important part about value stores, they need to have stable or at least predictable value. Bitcoin et al do not have a stable value, and their future value cannot be predicted yet, as evidenced by the hoards of price predictions that have been wrong so far.
@_date: 2018-02-08 01:40:23
But they’re not telling you the future of crypto currency, they’re telling you that the future cannot be reliably predicted.
@_date: 2019-01-22 18:33:12
Any A or higher rated bonds, USD, and real estate (not individual properties, but averaged values) off the top of my head. You could likely predict their values to within 10% 11 months out.
@_date: 2019-01-22 06:13:02
That's fairly circular logic you got there. You're saying volatility won't prevent cryptocurrency's growth, because it's growth will prevent volatility? But it has to grow in the first place to become less volatile, and if it remains this volatile it's never going to be adopted by the average person.

Based on historical data, we clearly do not need to hunt for food and live in caves anymore. If you're claiming you know the future, and *without* even using historical data to identify trends, you're just crazy.

Are you willing to give me a price prediction for 2020 right now, and pull a McAfee and eat your own dick if you’re wrong? Since apparently you have some divine mechanism for bitcoin price prediction that no one else has.

I’d wager that they’re right. If the future value of an asset can be reliably predicted, then the prediction will already be factored into the price.
