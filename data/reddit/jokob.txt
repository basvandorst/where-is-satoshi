They are actively marketing this (found adds). I posted this a few days ago with incorrect title so I've got downvoted, didn't bother to repost. Screenshots of the add in the comments.

1 "Our analysis estimated the intrinsic value bitcoinu to 1300 dollars."
David Woo, an analyst at Bank of America (5 December 2013 on the virtual currency Bitcoin)
Only the future will show whether it is correct to assign this currency intrinsic value. While the price of bitcoin bounces as it pleases.

I was thinking of the possibility of fiat withdrawals, but you are right it takes ages too and also if someone would take this as actual advice... 
@_date: 2014-01-27 11:29:17
small amount BTC withdrawals are OK for the most part (e.g. &lt;3BTC), larger ones 10,20,30 take forever 2-5 days. List of unprocessed withdrawals (value removed from MtGox account, but not shown in the wallets of recipients)

Which app do you mean?

Hi Guys, 
I am too affected by this issue, as most of you in this thread. I've send an email to the bitcoin foundation to clarify whats going on:






































I've sent it to their general email address:

I find it a bit sad that these kind of issues are not worked on together. Maybe a reference document for implementing wallet software is necessary, so the issue doesn't have to be fixed by every developer/software differently. Or package/dll containing all the necessary methods for implementing these kind of things could be open sourced and used in all programs so fixing it in one place would fix it everywhere. Again, I am no expert at cryptography, but these things seem to be easily implemented outside of the specific wallet code.

I wouldn't mind, but the registration fees are paid in BTC, which are currently stuck on MtGOX for me :)
@_date: 2014-02-10 10:56:02
I am not sure, if it's a minor issue, but I am by no means any expert, anyone able to support this? Is someone able to estimate the effort to fix this?
@_date: 2014-02-10 14:49:02
feeling the same, that's why I had to joke a bit to get it out of the system 
@_date: 2014-02-10 13:23:51
thank you kind stranger, I'll add these safely to my other funds on MtGox
@_date: 2014-01-25 20:23:48
Ahh yea,  sorry, you are right, sorry for the mistake, up vote for visibility

No email received and I had a kick starter account. I am using 2fa for gox and my email for any new device trying to login.

That's quite an expensive apartment :) no joking, in Czech republic you could get an apartment for about 2/3 of that right now,

In fact it is, this was already repeated a few times, back in the days, MtGox was the only exchange, so any issues with the exchange, caused prices to drop. Also there is much more liquidity in the market, which makes it less volatile (in %). I am not an investor, just my two satoshis.
@_date: 2013-04-12 11:15:40
Fun fact: I bought my first BitCoins 2 days before the crash of 2011, so I don't think I will forget that one :)
I am glad to see that the attitude didn't change much, the ones thinking BitCoin has a chance support it still.
@_date: 2013-08-22 19:38:57
so guys, this got me scared a bit, I have all my BC in mt gox (no USD funds), should I withdraw them? I like the security (2 step verification with google they are using). If yes, which wallet service do you suggest (local PC, mobile phone, on-line wallet)? I have some BTC, and I don't feel safe to carry them around in my phone and also placing them in a physical wallet doesn't seem extra safe.
@_date: 2013-08-22 20:14:31
Sounds very reasonable... if that's not much to ask, shoot me a PM if you are going to do so, so I don't miss it. I will of course keep an eye for this, but you never know...

I've misread it as "Russian Subway sandwich **stops** now accepting Bitcoin." ... :)

I am sorry to hear that too, many great suggestions in this thread, but the easiest and most foolproof thing is to set up Two Factor Authentication on the exchange you are using. This way the exchange itself needs to be compromised to get to your money or someone needs to have your login, password and device (phone/tablet - even a dedicated one) at the same time. Also, don't re-use usernames/passwords/emails for this account. A lot of people are taught some basic skills in protecting their property, but these work only for trivial "hacking" if we may call it that way (viruses, malware). The problem is now, that bitcoin hacking is too rewarding. So these basics aren't sufficient anymore, because hackers are more likely to invest more time into it. We need to step up our security game.

My mistake. I bought a couple of BTC on Mt.Gox so I am usually talking in the context of this exchange. Mt. Gox and most of the exchanges support 2FA (2 factor authentication) which combined with the things I mentioned above make it pretty safe. I haven't heard of any theft happening, where 2FA was enabled. That's why trust this approach so far, I don't like to store my money in the physical world (fires, robberies, floods), so I am storing it on an exchange, but that's my personal opinion. I mentioned the problems before (exchange goes out of business - that's why I am on Mt.Gox, which is around for quite some time). Cold storage methods are great, but I like to have access to my money basically immediately. An alternative would be having the wallet online and offline, but this means you have to think about security both, in the physical and virtual world. In general if you have 2FA you install an app on your phone, which generates access codes (every cca 30 seconds a new code) and you have to enter this code during logon/transactions on the exchange. I hope this helps.
@_date: 2013-11-30 20:04:53
Please add a note into your story about not setting up 2FA to educate people.
