I really like trybtc.com. It may be good for the popular links page we're putting together at Coinster.info. It's already added to the directory :)

This is horrible, but I can see it happening again. Bitcoin is highly technical but average users, as it gets more mainstream, are not. The restaurant owner wanted to make it easy for customers to send in payment, so a QR code sticker seemed simple.
We put up a utility at  to make exchanging wallet addresses in person easy. It's meant to be a sort of Internet hosted clipboard, accessible to any Internet connected device. QR codes are not easily human readable, but wallet addresses are, even if they're not easily memorable. This might have helped in this case.

Thanks, I've added that page to the directory :)
I really do like trybtc.com though and have known about it before it was posted to reddit. I like that it has a simplified big button type user experience.

Working on an eBay alternative now at Coinster.info :)
Low fees are the goal. Listing is free and there is only a 1.5% final value fee. Optional escrow is 1.5% and the plan is to create an escrow market where trusted escrow providers can compete to offer escrow at even lower prices.

Great job coinkite! You're on our popular links page under merchant services, which was looking thin with only BitPay and Coinbase. Keep up the great work!
