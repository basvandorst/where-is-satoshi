Thanks for your advice! Just now I notice that I can store USDT in the omni wallet.
I did not know BitFinex and [Tether.to]( is the same until your comment too. But why the min withdraw is too high? Min: $10k is acceptable but not $100k

If they allow me to withdraw USDT, this topic will never be created. There is no option to withdraw USDT currently. They force me to withdraw fiat.

Do you have any link about this scammy altcoins?

bitfinex is a good exchange. What is the relationship between 2 of them ? Can you give me a particular link? Thank you.

Fully verify, they have charged me 150 USDT for verified fee ... 
I store USDT here because I think it's the safest place to store. The exchange ( [btc-e.com]( ) can close anytime to stole your USDT. But, I think I'm wrong again :(

Seem like I'm going to lost my $10k USDT :(
@_date: 2019-10-17 18:09:35
Ok, now tell me how to withdraw $10k USDT ? I don't have option to send USDT but only withdraw. But the min withdraw is $100k USDT ???

But I did not store USDT on BFX, I stored it on Tether.to. U mean I have to create an account on BFX and ask them to transfer USDT from Tether.to?

I store tether in [tether.to]( and now I can't send it to any exchanges because of their rule. They only allow me to withdraw fiat to bank account with min: $100K ...

It's too old, 1 year ago, but USDT is still being kept on several exchanges? Seem like many people still trust USDT.
I don't have problem with USDT but [tether.to](
@_date: 2019-10-17 18:10:04
I have contacted them but they do no resolve this problem, so I have to create this topic.
