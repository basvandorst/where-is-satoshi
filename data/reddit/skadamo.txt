I hope John Ratliff updates his gbtc NAV calculator! ��

Good question. I believe if you own it before split you get the split. Really you get the same pie divided in 91 slices instead of 1 if that makes sense. So yeah, it has to work that way. No deadline.

Usually stock splits draw attention. Other than that it is irrelevant. Like exchanging 100 pennies for a dollar. 
Warren Buffett does not believe in stock splits. Check Berkshire Hathaway stock price. $300k per share.

I look forward to telling people I owned gbtc before the 91:1 stock split.
@_date: 2018-01-13 04:47:04
Hmm not sure.

Agreed. Buying BTC is harder than it should be. Coinbase fails when you try to add a credit card. Your credit card freezes your cc. Your credit union blocks the link to coinbase. Then you pay a $20 fee to buy $500 of BTC.
Buying gbtc with my fat stock market wins from 2017 is so much easier.
Edit: forgot to mention that as soon as BTC rises or falls quickly coinbase is unusable. It’s amateur hour there. TD Ameritrade can handle the volume, coinbase can’t.

Hey thanks and thanks for the reply.
Good question. I think about selling before the weekend but have never done it. I have about 5% of my retirement in gbtc so it won’t kill me if it drops. The 5% has grown to 10% at least. I am more concerned about missing a weekend pump then riding a dip out. If we pop to $25k BTC or a new high by next Friday I consider selling for the weekend. If I had 50% of my portfolio in gbtc I’d be much more likely to sell before weekend. 
I wish I could buy/sell like you are but my day job is to demanding. I have a few days off this week and I might give it a shot. For now I’m just buying dips.

My take....
After thanksgiving everyone signed up for Coinbase and tried to add a credit card. CC failed for some reason as is common for coinbase or they balked. It is still way to hard to buy crypto which is great for the persistent people and shows it is still early days.
After more fomo driven research they found out about GBTC and bought inside their self directed IRA or 401k that is brimming with cash from the last years market gains and due for a dip anyway. Then they realized the 70% premium exists. Profit taking started, followed by panic selling by people who bought at the top. 
Now it is bouncing back as people see a sale price. 
This will repeat all year so just buy a little more each dip. We get 30% tax shelter so 30% premium is OK imho.

Thanks! I thought it was way to high at $500 honestly. But BTC just kept going up. It all depends which way BTC goes. I’d say move into it slowly and see how it goes if you think BTC will correct soon. I wish I had a better answer.
@_date: 2017-12-16 18:08:17
Yes he is, you’re unnice.

I am fine with gbtc staying closer to Net Asset Value. Add to position if you like BTC.
@_date: 2017-12-06 16:12:24
My personal feeling is...
1) if futures drive BTC price down then gbtc will follow. The inverse holds as well.
2) if introduction of futures brings many crypto ETF choices to investors than the NAV of gbtc will drop and hold closer to tracking with BTC moves.
These are best guesses and I honestly don’t know. It is a great question and I want to hear from those more knowledgeable.
I’m long gbtc.

In the last 4 months I made a lot in gbtc with a fraction of the total value of my IRA. ( 401k rolled over to self directed IRA) I have thought about going “all in” many times. I would have killed it if I did it the first time it entered my mind. I probably won’t do it as much as I want to. ;)  Don’t bet the farm based on the past. ...I hope I listen to my own advice! Wish me luck. Don’t do it. ...even though I might.

If you have a 401k or IRA or other tax sheltered fund buy gbtc in that. This way you can avoid capital gains if you sell. 
If your buying with cash just buy BTC straight away.  
I’ve made more with gbtc in the last 4 months than I’ve made in 10 years with s&amp;p 500 ETFs. With less money invested. But who knows what the future holds.

Gbtc doing a stock split and BTC forking are two completely different things. If BTC forks then gbtc will own coins of BTC and its fork. They are paying out the bitcoin cash they got after the fork to share holders.

Tulips had less utility than bitcoin so I’d say we have some upside left.

This chart should help everyone with gbtc premium questions.
@_date: 2017-10-11 08:45:30
Yeah I guess I'm more of a forum guy. For some reason I never got active on Reddit.

The way I look at it is I can buy $gbtc tax sheltered in my 401k / IRA. This is a 30% savings vs. buying BTC after the gov takes a 30% cut from my paycheck. Then if I sell in less than 1 year I don't pay capital gains. So $gbtc is worth a premium over buying BTC to me. Maybe not 100% as I understand it currently is. 
I don't see how the fork affects $gbtc. The Greyscale gets the bitcoin gold and hopefully distributes to $gbtc owners like they say they will with Bitcoin Cash. Yes lots of ifs and assumptions. Maybe people are just buying BTC straight and not $gbtc now that they are more savvy?

Tone is one of the few people who use logic to predict price movement of bitcoin and explains it to people in ways they can understand it. Keep it up Tone!
Honestly I ignore most of his altcoin thoughts even though many of them are correct.
