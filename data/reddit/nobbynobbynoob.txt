Don't know really.
Bitcoin may become more widely used in a deflationary depression[*], but the price action might not be too bullish in an absolute sense but only relative to other assets. This would be a parallel with gold/silver.
Bitcoin price may skyrocket _hard_ during hyperinflation.
All of the above assumes the Internet doesn't die.
[*] as if our central bankster overlords would let this happen easily - they're gonna print print print, in part due to their pathological fear of a deflationary depression, in part due to the insurmountable debt mountain they have foisted upon us.

The key thing to understand is that you never use a paper wallet more than once. Either HODL the 'coin or redeem it, but after redemption, the paper wallet should be considered null and void, thus be disposed of.
@_date: 2016-08-03 14:15:52

HODL has been the in crowd's phrase for keeping your bitcoin and not selling them, since about late 2013. :)

Bitcoin itself isn't a tax evasion scheme, but one advantage it has over cash or PMs in this respect is that it can be used to evade Customs or capital controls.
@_date: 2016-08-20 18:24:55
Correct - never reuse a paper wallet after spending the funds, they must be redeemed all in one go. This isn't a problem, because paper wallets are for longer-term cold storage, and when you want to use it, you sweep _all_ the funds from the paper wallet to a hot or "live" wallet, and if you want to cold store some leftovers, you create a _new_ paper wallet (or keypair) to do that.

Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency but the client software does not use export-restricted encryption AFAIK, unless the wallet encryption feature counts.

In the US and many other places, trading in itself is clearly not taxable - but *profiting* from trades *is*.

**This is not legal advice**.
You can get away with that perhaps if you stay strictly off the books: cash in hand, goods in hand, no Coinbase or banks, no outrageously large acquisitions of assets in your name you cannot reasonably explain away.
Remember though: you don't *pay* taxes, they *take* taxes. While criminal prosecution for simple non reporting would be extreme (and costly for the State), remember the IRS and other tax authorities can and do just come and seize your stuff if they have enough to believe you're a tax delinquent.

Sometimes. Many cryptos, particularly the older, more established ones such as BTC and LTC, go up and down roughly in tandem - but not exactly so. LTC trades in a much thinner market so its spikes and troughs can be more accentuated than BTC ones.
In the past, it was easy to build a crypto stack by flipping LTC to BTC and back, buying LTC at ~5 mBTC/coin and selling it back to BTC at 20+ mBTC/coin, rinse, repeat and profit. This became less effective as the volatility subsided and became less frequent. To profit like this now often requires taking bigger risks on more "out there", ultra-thinly-traded ultra-speculative alts.

If you're looking for *legal* methods to pay less tax, then the normal term is "tax avoidance". "Tax evasion" implies *breaking the law* to pay less tax, and no one is going to give advice on doing that on a public forum such as reddit.
Moving to Germany may help you lower your CGT liabilities, but in other areas you would probably pay much *higher* taxes in Germany, e.g. about 6 USD per gallon of gasoline, most of which is tax (but in western Europe, driving is generally not totally necessary).
Sadly, US citizenship is a burden in this regard because the IRS claims the right to tax all US citizens anywhere on Earth (figure that out!) and Uncle Sam has done all kinds of spit such as FATCA to try to enforce that tax net to a degree as well, which ultimately means you'd need to renounce your US citizenship or otherwise make do with illegal tax evasion. Leaving the US, followed by *never* filing a US tax return ever again, along with never renewing US passport, would work for most; however this is still technically "tax evasion" according to Uncle Sam.

Yes, British dependencies are under "British sovereignty", but it is that of the *Crown* and *not* of the scumbag crookèd Westminster politicians, unless the territorial government in question has delegated such powers to them, for example the case of delegation of oversight of the Channel Islands, the Isle of Man and Gibraltar's application of the European Convention on Human Rights.
An example of how this pans out in practice is that if a British dependent territory wishes to execute a convicted criminal, the Westminster parliament has *no* right or power to prevent this, but Her Majesty can and does intervene to stop executions from happening in UK territories, even though she didn't block executions in the UK itself throughout the 1950s and '60s. - Ed.

You could sell them all at once on an exchange like Bitstamp (subject to AML registration of course), then dump the fiat into your bank account. For that much money, the government is going to take an interest regarding taxes, unless you live somewhere with no capital-gains tax, for example. (**Disclaimer**: IANAL; I offer no formal tax or legal advice.)

Post-"bubble" "blow-off phase" really. It's good that there isn't too much bearishness, which, if there were, would not be wholly surprising either. Markets and bubbles operate in their own irrational, ahem, bubbles, not wholly independently of external news, but partly so. In other words, hostile regulatory sounds from Russia or China don't automatically crash the price, and conversely, good news about adoption, etc. (some of which was probably already priced in by speculators during the boom) does not automatically induce instant surges in new fiat entering the market.

This kind of thing is really pressing and important, highlighting the desperate need for a workable decentralized trading platform for exchanging bitcoin into other assets, including fiat, in a peer-to-peer fashion.

**Disclaimer: I am not a lawyer or tax expert.**
If you live in the UK you are subject to capital gains tax on the gains from sales of assets/commodities to fiat (unless they're specifically exempt). The rules aren't as asinine as in some other countries, such as the US (where the IRS claims right to tax every gain on every trade), but significant sales to GBP will definitely have to be reported for taxes if they are over the threshold.
There are ways to cash out without paying capital gains tax: some are legal and some are not. In either case, they may turn out less practical than just giving the Don his dues.

Bitpay doesn't require confirmations. But if you use an exchange (e.g. Bitstamp as in the example above) as a wallet, then a glitch or delay in exchange withdrawals might affect you, so I guess it's best to use a proper wallet, either local or blockchain.info, for this type of transaction.

So it was right (assuming a negative-equity position) to sell bitcoin at $2 in November 2011? Or $65 in July 2013?
Experienced traders can sometimes accept a loss on trade X because they spot potential for profit on trade Y where it is sufficiently likely that Y &gt;&gt; X.
If you consider all investments as 100% sunk costs, and never sell low, I consider that much more workable for noobs. The advice of never realizing a loss was not meant for *advanced* traders, duh!

What judah_mu said. The mantra is, like it or not: touch fiat, get regulated. To be honest, the majority of the Bitcoin community has always been realistic about this: whether or not we *like* government regulations (AML/KYC et al) is beside the point; we know we are going to face regulation when fiat gets involved. To some degree, grey-market exchanges like [BTC-e]( can get around this, but only awkwardly; trying to wire fiat into or out of that exchange can be a tricky proposition.

The System D economy worldwide is estimated to be worth a trillion bucks or more so there's still plenty of room for adoption. I can see government restrictions inducing short-term panic, but bitcoin could end up being worth more if banned (which is the norm for banned commodities!) after showing its resilience in the face of censorship or totalitarianism.
I'm not saying governments aren't any threat to bitcoin whatsoever, but there may be more subtle and bigger threats, such as a vastly superior second-generation system taking over, although that currently seems unlikely, and any altcoin that offers something really special may wind up having its features incorporated into a Bitcoin fork, and on we truck.

Manxpersons are British citizens (and by extension, EU citizens if they have enough connections with the UK/EU).
If you have right of residence in the UK then this also applies to the Isle of Man. Five years' residence is sufficient to gain "belonger" status that is required for working without a permit. I believe naturalization rules on the island are parallel to those in the UK for becoming a British citizen (the Manx passport is a British passport with a variant design).

Not all of us who knew about bitcoin in 2012 are chock rich. While I discovered it around the same time that email was written, and it looked potentially like the sort of high-risk, high-reward investment I'd been craving for years, I mainly got into it from hearing it mentioned on anarcho-libertarian blogs/Facebook feeds, and interest in the underlying technology. So yes, I did buy some bitcoin, but spent a good deal of it (not on SR! I paid over ฿8 to enter the 2012 London Bitcoin conference). The profit on what's left is just a nice incidental benefit. I never thought of or touted Bitcoin as a "get rich quick scheme", for obvious reasons. I don't think too many of us really expected 2013 to be quite as crazy as it turned out!

Well, the Queen can intervene in the islands' affairs, but the Westminster government may not do so, without express prior permission.

Right. But Westminster does not in any way control the internal affairs of British dependent territories (exception: their foreign and defence policies are in UK hands, thus also associating them politically with the EU, although they're not in the EU, Gibraltar aside), unless this has been expressly delegated by some treaty or similar obligations, such as the application of the ECHR in Britain's European dependencies. When the territorial governments are overridden by "the motherland", it is by order of the British *monarch* or the local Governor General representing him/her. The Westminster politicians (crooks that most of them are) have "jurisdiction" in the UK only. Plus, it's been known for the Crown/Governor General to dissolve an elected government in an independent Commonwealth country before: Australia 1975, anyone?

International wires are a pain in the arse. Setting up accounts is a pain in the arse, much more so than opening a bitcoin wallet, yes. Although I don't recall it happening to me, getting your account frozen is no fun either (actually I think it happened to me with NeTeller many years ago). And then there are those fees. And the "too big to fail" side of things.
Credit unions are better, but even they aren't perfect. Some time ago, an ATM declined my credit card for a cash withdrawal but didn't show that the card was declined, so I had to go to some length, quite a few phone calls, complete with call gates, warts and all, to make sure that my card hadn't been charged.

No requirement to give change in the UK, it's just good business practice. :)
GBP is legal tender, which means if you want the courts to enforce a debt obligation, the debt will be denominated in GBP and you have to be willing to accept GBP as settlement payment. It does not mean you have to accept GBP if selling/exchanging things, but again, it makes sense generally to accept fiat because of the liquidity available: it's amazing how many shops accept fiat! :)
When placing a Gumtree ad for an old computer that I sold in 2013, I advertised the price as 99 GBP, cash accepted, while offering a steep discount for direct payment in gold, silver or bitcoin. The buyer paid me 100 GBP in cash (I was carrying no change) and seemed satisfied with the deal. :)

They probably continue(d) to pay tax in GBP; in this instance, goods are still *priced* in GBP and thus bitcoin is being used as a "money surrogate". More interesting is the case in which goods are priced *only* in bitcoin with no fiat references. This would be more akin to a pure barter, and while tax offices claim the right to tax this, the value of the profit/gain, given it has to be quoted in fiat for tax purposes, becomes much more subjective. Another example is if I paint a nice DIY abstract work of art and you love it so much you agree to exchange one of your Renoir originals for it. If I then sell to fiat there is an obvious and measurable capital gain but what if I just keep the Renoir on my wall? The gain is then purely subjective. Anyhow, whatever the official tax position on pure barter (not using money surrogates with prices still in fiat!), it is difficult to enforce on private person-to-person trades. High-street businesses are fixed and centralised and easier to extort by the tax man.

Which historically until 1999ish was partially pegged to gold and thought of as one of the world's most stable and reliable fiats.

They do have the power to oversee and regulate their country's banking cartel in most cases? The Chinese (and most other nations') bitcoin "ban" really amounts to this: the central banking authority expressly prohibits that country's officially licensed *banks* from handling bitcoin or treating it as money.

Assuming not a troll...
This sub is full of hard-core Bitcoin "nerds", many of whom would screech as loudly as is not too obnoxious "bitcoin *is* money!" However, if it is fiat currency (e.g. USD, EUR, RUR, CNY, etc.) you seek, there are various exchanges online and a few machines ("ATMs") in meatspace that allow you to exchange bitcoin for fiat, in similar fashion to selling gold. A major broker in the USA is [Coinbase]( for example. An excellent global site for arranging private bitcoin-fiat trade is [LocalBitcoins]( which I believe works just about anywhere except Germany at the moment.
What you do with your bitcoin is up to you, but a lot of us on this sub would advise you not to sell all of it. Why not keep at least a few and see what happens in the future? Bitcoin is in limited supply and cannot just be printed up the way that banks print up fiat currency at will.

(Disclaimer: no legal advice in this post.)
It depends how much. If you're trading serious volume the best bet might be to use a solid exchange with good liquidity such as Bitfinex, Kraken or Bitstamp, but these require SEPA or international wire transfer, which carries a fee.
Capital gains under 11000 GBP per year in the UK are legally tax exempt. I think (but don't quote me on it) the tax rate is 10% for gains above that, unless you're a 40+% income tax payer.
Good luck!

If I were lucky enough to have &gt;&gt;100 BTC, I wouldn't be desperate to HODL all of it: 100 BTC seems like plenty TBH. So I'd be happy to sell/spend some of it, especially the portion above 100 BTC worth. Equally, the luxury of being able to HODL 260 BTC is nice if one has it.
So, HODL everything, or maybe HODL about half of that stash, but try not to go full fiat unless you *really* have to - my worthless opinion, not financial advice.

TBF, even as a massive gold- and bitcoin fan boi, I've never liked the term "invest" in gold or bitcoin. They are **commodities**, and they pay no yield, so one does not *invest* in them: rather, one can buy, sell, speculate or HODL. The difference is subtle but important.

*...we need new and fair regulations that will allow for the digital currency industry to grow in a safe and responsible manner with little red tape and bureaucracy involved* = laws against theft and fraud, basically, nothing new there. Beyond that, further regulation looks to be counterproductive unless obtaining possible co-operation from the legacy banking system is perceived to be a high priority.
There are two ways of viewing the Bitcoin ecosystem thus:
- It is its own innovative network entirely separate from legacy finance; or
- It needs to be interwoven with the "old" system to develop significantly.
Personally, I prioritise the first of the above points.

These bans are more enforced by _fear_ than actual force.
Life for most people in the 1930s was very hard indeed (by today's standards that is), and amidst an economic depression, people seemed, understandably really, to desire _security_ above all else, and were even willing to submit to a form of fascism in the hope of attaining it. It would have been easy in 1933 to say "you're doing the right thing for your country to give up your gold", and many would probably happily have complied without the need for enforcement. Also, AIUI, the law did not apply to small holders, those with under 100 USD worth of gold/silver (about five troy ounces of gold).
Also, when the feds tried to enforce the gold ban, the first places they raided were "safety" deposit boxes.

That is definitely a possibility (I've upvoted your comment as such). However, we cannot be sure. In a real economic crisis similar to 2008, or worse, ~1929-47, say, it is by no means a sure thing that bitcoin prices will rise further. HODLers may sell/spend their 'coin to keep food on the table, so to speak (or the 21st-century equivalent, e.g. keep the broadband connected - full-on hunger crisis is very unlikely in the advanced economies), and fiat could conceivably enter a period of deflation (unless central banks act very aggressively to counter it, which they may, owing to their pathological fear of deflation), and all or almost all asset prices, crypto included, may drop. In that event, cash will be king, followed closely by gold and silver (they're immune to a sudden turn of fiat inflation).
In an apocalyptic scenario, we're all dead or better off dead anyway, so one might as well overlook that consideration.

What the other posters have said, but, getting a little worried, I went over to BTER and looked at the spot price and it shows 1784 CNY, which is certainly not 80 USD lower than other exchanges: it's more like 2 USD lower, which seems okay to me. ETA: BTER operates out of China, not the US.
Now, all that said, BTER has suffered from some security concerns in the recent past - they were recently "hacked" losing some client funds - and indeed, they lost about 0,84 BTC of *my* money of which only about 0,07 BTC has been returned thus far, but at least it appears they are trying to honour the losses and (slooooowly) correct their mistake.

I do think bitcoin could rise in an economic slump but it's far from a foregone conclusion. A 1930s collapse could conceivably be *deflationary*, where commodities would be okay but cash would still reign supreme (gaining purchasing power over time, q.v. USD from 1929 to '32 for example).
That said, if you bet on policymakers to continue with QE/ZIRP/NIRP/name inflationary policy of choice, then gold/silver/bitcoin look like a very good hedge.

In the event of a **non-deflationary depression**: unclear effect on bitcoin price in fiat.
In the (unlikely?) event of a **deflationary depression**: *bearish* effect on bitcoin price in fiat, and price of almost all assets until the deflation stops. In that environment, cash (and I mean *cash*, not bank deposits) will be king, followed by gold and silver, whose prices may fall but not in real terms.

Unless there's a wealth tax in force, there is no tax on crypto as such. Income and capital gains, however, are taxable in many countries, whether crypto is involved or not. One could evade these taxes by keeping accounts **off the books**, but again, that applies to cash as well as PMs or cryptos.

Bitcoin is still a nascent commodity, so yes, it's not super easy to buy everywhere, but generally it's no trickier to buy than gold.
@_date: 2017-09-01 02:07:34
Rapid price rises (bubbles) have lasted up to about a couple of months in Bitcoin world in the past, typically ending in a - scoff - "ejaculatory" phase where price unsustainably doubles within about a week, before reaching the "new paradigm" peak of that infamous "anatomy of a bubble" chart, then crashing.
Like many good commodities, crypto is prone to short periods of overvaluation followed by long, protracted periods of undervaluation.

Quite true, but many people, including some well into crypto, seem unaware or have forgotten that the original exchange rate for bitcoin was **zero**, before it made the infinite leap to ~1300-2000 BTC = 1 USD ca November 2009.

Mining profits are subject to income tax.
Exchanging crypto is considered the disposition of an asset and falls under capital gains or losses. The headline rates of capital gains tax are lower than income tax: maximum 28%, not 45%.

Mt Gox, the first fully-automated electronic bitcoin exchange, opened its frappuccino-laced doors to the general public in July 2010; bitcoin traded on that exchange at an initial rate of 16 BTC = 1 USD. Six to twelve months earlier, the going rate was more like 1300 BTC = 1 USD.

A central bank cannot outlaw anything in general, that would be the government's job [to enact new legislation]. The CB's rôle is to oversee the cartels of commercial banks.

Not quite, since "bitcoins" are not actually singular separable entities. Rather, one should ideally say "less bitcoin" (analogous to "less gold"), IMHO.

The official and internationally-recognized position is:
There is **one China** - and Hong Kong, Macau, Tibet, and Taiwan, are part of it. However, those regions to differing degrees have autonomy from Peking, to the point of functional independence in the case of Taiwan. Hong Kong once again became a Chinese region when the British handed the territory back in 1997.
A "crypto ban" on the Chinese mainland presumably would fall under economic/financial regulation, where HK is highly autonomous, and it would (probably) not be affected directly.

First off, the usual message. **Taxation is THEFT.** (actually it's worse than that, but TiT is a buzzier catchphrase than more accurate variants)
Much as many of us are anarchists, peaceful folk who just want to get on with life, and despise the violent coercion of government and taxation, we obviously cannot actively help with unlawful tax *evasion* advice... but that was not what you were asking about. Minimizing tax bills can require the work of specialist tax professionals in many cases, but regarding CGT, there are numerous ways to avoid it legally:
- The obvious: **don't realize the gains.** (Trading assets online or in offshore institutions away from the prying eyes of your local taxman, and the legal implications of all that, is too complex an issue for me to discuss here, and anyway, I'm not a qualified tax attorney so couldn't do so with great confidence.)
- Emigrate. (If you're a US citizen then strictly speaking you will have to either pay the IRS, renounce your citizenship, or just plain evade taxes illegally. The US gov is totalitarian and doesn't offer too many good options.)
- Try to take advantage of "non-domicile" or other tax loopholes that may be able to help you reduce your local tax bill without you having to flee the country. Again, this is a bit too complex to discuss in short.
- What others have mentioned: look for tax deductibles such as gifting, and possible capital-loss writeoffs.
Good luck.

Indeed. (94% I think but let's not split hairs. - Ed.)
Thing is though, is the whole ecosystem was totally different. There was a small nerdy Bitcoin community - oh if only I had realized how tiny it actually was! - relatively few crypto apps, only one or two major exchanges, and most of all, the miners were very influential on the ecosystem. They had been *lording* it at the time with the exchange rate above 10 USD, but were still able to make decent bank even at 3 USD, hence the price drop after the bubble popped (when everyone got Gox'd for the first(?) time in a big way). They were almost as happy selling at 3 USD as they were at 30. With hindsight they may wish they had HEDL. ;)

Bitcoin-to-Paypal exchanges are hard to effect because of the chargeback risk (fraud): basically, a Bitcoin transaction is irreversible, whereas a Paypal transaction is not. Paypal has also been known, along with the banksters, to freeze accounts of bitcoin traders from time to time. AIUI, trading bitcoin violates Paypal's ToS so they may well freeze out your account if they discover you've been trading bitcoin using it.

They want to record data on large Bitcoin transactions entering or leaving exchanges and other Bitcoin-storage companies.
Yes, this is already a standard part of AML policy. Enforcing it on a simple A-to-B Bitcoin transaction is essentially unworkable, as with barter/cash/PMs peer to peer, for example.

Sorry about this news.
All "lost" bitcoin is good for the community as a whole, of course - deflation - but it's no consolation to you.
I fairly recently (probably) lost about 260 mBTC because Hive Wallet screwed me when I tried to log in to transfer the funds, then subsequently I replaced my phone but cannot for the life of me find the backup seed anywhere. OTOH I could swear I wrote it on a piece of paper, so it's not 100% certain the funds are lost, but since I can't find it, I'm basically treating them as such.
And I always thought I was pretty diligent and careful with bitcoin, LOL.

It's bitcoin *exchanges* that might need be concerned with this sort of thing. Bitcoin itself is not an organization with a focal point of attack; it is a peer-to-peer network, and history shows that governments aren't very effective at censoring the Internet - and believe me, some of them try very hard to do just that!

Hi and good luck.
I remember the heady days of sending GBP to Mt Gox directly through their UK portal and buying a few ฿ at about £7 each! Sadly, thanks to Barclays' antics (they froze Gox's UK feeder account on September 25) this option is no longer available.
I have realized no fiat profits from cryptocoin holding/trading because I don't sell for fiat. I hold or spend my ฿.
If the banking system and the clunkiness/primitiveness of the online exchanges burdens you, there is the OTC trading site localbitcoins.com.
I don't really give trading advice in public but if I must do regarding bitcoin it's this: *never panic sell - ever.* Remember that for all the risks inherent in using ฿ as an *investment* rather than just a transactional mechanism, they make for much sounder money than fiat (IMHO).

The current bitcoin prices may, or may not be, a bubble in the classical sense. The present market certainly does *look* like a bubble, however.
The key to remember is that bitcoin, like many commodities, is traded at the margins. Overall supplies are limited, and the quantity for sale even more limited. Now, if a few wealthy investor types scoop up most of the loose bitcoins, suddenly there aren't enough to go around at those trading margins, so the price *must* rise dramatically to balance it all out. This could be a bubble *iff,* all of a sudden, a few large holders of bitcoin decide to take a dump. This may burst the bubble if panic selling ensues and the price will tank: probably not as severely as the bear market of 2011 ($31 -&gt; $2) but tank nevertheless. If there are periodic smaller dumps that cause mini-corrections during this bull run, I think that is very healthy for bitcoin longer term, because it disperses the 'coins and shakes out panicky weak hands that sell (really, buy fiat) too readily.
Wherever bitcoin price trends can be an opportunity. Don't bet on it going up forever! (And I'm a hard-core bull, from a long-term perspective. But the bears should never be ignored, for when they get totally ignored, that's when you know there's probably a bubble.)

It was rock steady at $125 for weeks before the "Chinese" run-up so I highly doubt we'll test $100 again. $300 maybe, but if it trends that low I'll probably be selling almost anything I can, including gold, to buy bitcoin (I can always buy the gold back after we've reached "da moon". ;)

You're right of course: there is no guarantee of the same outcome. The only evidence we have is that government interfering in things or restricting them rarely makes them cheaper. Anything that is forbidden fruit draws attention to itself.
In the foreseeable future, I don't see governments having huge issue with cryptocurrency itself. Things you can do illegally with crypto you can do illegally with fiat anyway. It seems to be the banksters getting all in a tizz over bitcoin exchanges and AML-related issues, so are freezing accounts left, right and centre.

And yet, the June 2011 bubble and subsequent four-month bear market wasn't quite as severe as the peak-to-trough fall of 92% suggests. There were major security scares including a Mt Gox hack that triggered the initial slump. I believe volume above about $15 was more or less thin air at that point anyway so it didn't take much to drop the *spot price* from $30ish to $15ish. And even at the base of the subsequent trough, the exchange rate was still about four times higher than at the start of that year before the bubble.
Just to put a few things into perspective. **PS** I had not really discovered Bitcoin back then, so I'm only going on what I've read/learned as secondhand evidence of those events (luckily it's quite well-documented).

Faucets that dole out free bitcoin often don't pay immediately because the payouts are far too low, so the transaction fee would render the payment uneconomical. Sites like Daily Bitcoins hold your payouts by default until you release them, which allows you to stack up a larger payout for which the transaction fee will be relatively less punitive, e.g. after a couple of weeks' work, you've earned 75.000 satoshi, and you can request a release of the queued payouts in one lump, and the transaction fee of 10.000 to ~25.000 satoshi won't hurt so badly.

If the price of bitcoin or any commodity you hold falls, you don't lose anything unless you sell. Generally speaking (barring exceptional speculative situations), a good trading rule of thumb is *never, ever* sell for a lower price than you bought in for. Personally, on small investments, I look for at least ~1000% profit or so, and only risk what I'm willing to lose.

Very reasonable thoughts, and many of the responses here have covered things well enough.
One reason why it's tough to buy bitcoin or other cryptocurrency with credit cards or PayPal is that Bitcoin is an *irreversible* payment method whereas cards and PP are reversible. So trading bitcoin for cards or PP is very risky unless you're doing business with someone highly trusted.
Regarding the bitcoin valuation question, like with any currency, its numbers are arbitrary. You understand the importance of money being freed from high inflation and political interference, and to that end it makes little difference if one unit buys at least such and such over time, or 1000 units buy such and such over time, as long as the money is stable or appreciating. "A bitcoin" is obviously not a tangible object, as you rightly point out, but more akin to expressing a weight of commodity, similar to gold ounces.
Anyway, whether or not you've bought bitcoin, you have some now. :)

But these really needed to be adopted across the board for all imperial units - a twelve-ounce pound and twelve-pound stone could really be quite "humanized" and handy, for example - and base twelve adopted for numeration. However, the development of modern computing usurped all of this, because computers work in base two, not ten or twelve.

1 MB hard limit on transaction blocks. Either this will be lifted or transaction fees will become expensive (in real terms), making bitcoin purely a settlement currency like gold bars rather than an everyday transactional one like silver denarii or paper notes. (I wonder if that was Satoshi's vision.)
I tend to agree with Frank Braun, who spoke at the London Bitcoin conference last autumn, that the OTC market will have to take up a lot of the "slack". Gox just isn't up to snuff, and I don't think bitcoin can afford to have weak focal points like that, or "Jesus nuts" if you will.

The last crash might not be an indicator because now is not 2011. One can superimpose a graph of the 2011 bubble over the 2013 bubble with a similar start point, and the 2011 bubble is proportionally much larger, and we are now at a similar position on the graph to when the 2011 slide bottomed out, proportionally speaking. That doesn't prove that $88-$97 is the "new $2" of course, but the 2011 bubble cannot be used as predictive evidence for future price action.

This sounds oddly "pessimistic" but is backed by the anecdotal history of bitcoin prices in that their rate of increase has relatively speaking been explosive during odd-numbered years and much slower (though still pretty decent) during the even-numbered ones.
As for a final USD price of a matured bitcoin, that is almost irrelevant in a sense, since there is no upper bound: after all, the Fed can "print as much as it likes", and is indeed doing so.

For me, gov is not a major worry. Things don't get cheaper when the state bans them, and that's about the worst the state can do (q.v. "war on drugs" or anti-gambling legislation).
There are scalability issues with Bitcoin, however, much as I have a lot of belief in the developers to deal with them (they are very smart and dedicated people!). And now we should not forget that the FBI seems to be in possession of more than 1% of all bitcoin.

No, *fiat* is Latin meaning "let it be done", in other words, it refers to decree (as in, "by fiat"), in the case of currency, the decree that a given currency is legal tender in payment of a debt as decided by a court. You can refuse to accept fiat when selling something, but if you want to use the state-backed courts to settle a debt, you have to be willing to accept the payment in fiat currency (USD in the USA).
@_date: 2013-11-04 15:49:02
Yeah, you've got the basic idea.
"221 2306" (right column, top) would represent ฿2306 to buy up to get the price to (or over) $221, actually. I don't think you can tell whether volume at a fixed price (left column) is the result of one or multiple actors: the number is the total bid/ask volume at that particular price point.

In proportional terms, this is *nowhere near* the 2011 bubble, as was recently explained on Bitcointalk. Drawing a log graph gives a better perspective. If this explosion were comparable to the '11 bubble the price would already be *at least* $600 per ฿.

I never felt warmly welcome there as an international student, and ran into issues with their managerial bureaucracy, but when I decided enough was enough ("I'm paying five-digit tuition fees for *this?!*") they couldn't have been quicker to give me my tuition money back.

฿0,001 = millibitcoin (mBTC) or bitmill (BTM), already standard in the foresightful world of online gaming. If bitcoin price continues its upward trend, it will become more common elsewhere too. You can adjust the settings in the Bitcoin-Qt client so that this is the default operational unit.

Yes, I suppose that's true, but the same applies to stocks/shares or any limited commodity, basically. If you have something that is scarce, and others want it, you gain the value (as Eric Voorhees pointed out on a show with Tom Woods recently).
The big difference between, say, a non-inflationary cryptocurrency or a legitimate stock and a "Ponzi", of course, is that the former do not fraudulently promise endless guarantees of future profit. Bitcoin is not a get-rich-quick scheme, even though it may be possible in the long run to get rich by simply holding BTC, should it become ubiquitously traded or a reserve currency of some sort.

This is indeed almost inevitable *iff Bitcoin is ultimately a successful project,* and it may very well become so.

Yes. But that's fine, because it isn't harming anybody else. As long as they are "hoarding", it has essentially the same effect as their 'coins not being on the market at all. (Sure, they're free to dump them, but they can only dump them once. Banks can print as much fiat as they wish, pretty much.)
Bitcoin is not a Ponzi or pyramid scheme because there are no (fraudulently) promised future gains to holders. As a synthetic commodity money, bitcoin shares some characteristics in common with stocks/shares. The earlier adopters who hold larger volume benefit the most, but they took on more risk; they are potentially rewarded greatly in similar way to those who were astute enough to get into Apple, Google or Microsoft, say, early enough. Late adopters will benefit too, otherwise there is no incentive for them to adopt at all. Bitcoin is voluntary, not backed by State force.

It may be kind of partisan (except which political party do I support? I dislike just about all of them, it's just a matter of the degree of intensity of dislike!) in a way, but it's not irrelevant. Socialist governments in Britain (1960s and '70s) as well as FDR's America, not to mention modern-day Argentina, have tended to resort to capital controls such as restricting capital movement and banning private bullion ownership when the effects of their overspending/fiscal mismanagement are felt. Allende's Chile and the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe resorted to the printing press. Either way, it is precisely this kind of government control (capital controls more than taxes) that bitcoin can free us from. I won't deny that Norway is a nice country, and it's a model of a form of democratic socialism that works pretty well, *but it's still the exception and not the rule.*

Mathematically, this matter is utterly arbitrary; the Bitcoin protocol only fundamentally accounts in satoshi balances anyway.

The "bear" argument that bitcoin's "intrinsic" value based on the absolute here and now, especially with the flimsy infrastructure (Gox et al, never to be confused with the robust and wonderful Bitcoin protocol itself), is no more than $40, generously, is actually perfectly reasonable, and I'd have to agree with it...
...but it kind of misses the point about real-life markets. *All* markets/commodities/currencies are subject to speculative value, so saying that bitcoin shouldn't be worth more than $40 is a bit like saying gold shouldn't be worth more than, say (pluck a figure out of my behind), $100 per troy ounce based on its intrinsic cosmetic and industrial value. That's all true but markets don't work that way. Speculative "bubble" value is still real value, because people are still willing to pay that price.
Many are paying &gt;$100 per bitcoin in the OTC market, if sites like localbitcoins and bitbargain are to be believed.

Psychologically speaking, I think I'm with you here. But the decimal should be shifted *three* places to the right - at least when we are past, say (arbitrarily), 250 USD/BTC.
It should be noted:
* Bitcoin is a voluntary arrangement and any individual/business is free to denominate their accounting in BTC/mBTC/µBTC/satoshi/whatever already.
* If you run the Bitcoin-Qt client, under *Settings -&gt; Options -&gt; Display* you can change the default display unit. Unfortunately, satoshi balances (no decimal point thus) aren't yet offered by the client; this may change in future.
* I believe all Bitcoin clients worth their salt should offer mBTC/µBTC/satoshi display options, *right now.*

It's worth reiterating, since that graph pretty much outlines the history of the bitcoin marketplace, that (astonishingly) bitcoin has been almost free of bear markets, with the notable exception of June-October 2011. A few other short periods in 2011 and 2012 have been mildly bearish but not of great statistical significance.
This information does not provide any guarantees of future prices, but is nonetheless very worthy of close consideration. Bitcoin seems, in general, very resistant to bearishness. For now at least.

Alas, we have no idea who controls those funds (though the largest wallets may be exchanges), or how many of those addresses are live versus lost bitcoins.
As large dumps occur on Mt Gox et al, 'coins are getting dispersed and this is healthy for the bitcoin ecosystem. So-called hoarding is not in and of itself a problem. Bitcoin business is only just starting to ride; Bitpay is exploding.

That's right, if you've created new receiving addresses or spent funds from the wallet, the wallet needs to be backed up more often than every 100 active transactions/address creations, in part because the client creates hidden "change addresses" when an outgoing transaction is made.

This is the reverse of the problem of how to pay your bitcoin to a non-user (for which the answer might be Coinapult-type services).
I think the answer will depend on which country the payer is located in. One method would be for them to use an on-the-fly bitcoin exchange. I don't know if [Coinbase]( serves this purpose conveniently in the US, but it is oft recommended. The Aussies have [Spendbitcoins]( and [Coinjar]( while there's [Bittylicious]( in the UK (฿0,5 max). The payer should supply *your* receiving Bitcoin address in which to pay the funds, obviously. HTH.
@_date: 2013-04-10 15:41:40
There is a buffer of 100 addresses (created by *Receive coins -&gt; New address* or when you pay bitcoin and hidden "change" addresses are created) before which a backup becomes out of date and unusable.

Selling high, buying low, day trading... that's all good.

I'm not sure that's the case, though, since these days even the so-called "havens" want to be AML compliant, and any road, even if they did allow "anonymous finance", they might not want to serve US customers so as to minimize conflict with US authorities. Swiss banks, for example, are fed up of tax issues with US clients. Blame the US govt/IRS.

Indeed. Although Australia is an insanely regulated, cartelized society (sadly; I think amazing things would happen there if they deregulated a lot of their industries, such as gambling, and truly became Nevada of the south, for example) and I think they have about four major banks and one major credit union (that I can think of off hand). But there might be just enough competition, even with just that, to allow for one or two bitcoin-friendly institutions. My former bank, the Commonwealth, appears less keen, whereas NAB is friendlier, at least for now (based on bitcoin-related news I've read).

Yes, the USA, along with the Philippines and Eritrea, claim the "right" to tax based on *citizenship* as well as residence. (The tax allowance for non-resident citizens is much larger, however.) I suppose US citizens abroad could - and probably often do - ignore the IRS demands for tax returns, but then, if the IRS has been tracking them and deems them to owe enough back taxes, they could face trouble if they ever set foot in the US again...

The fact that people actually want to use currencies like bitcoin, litecoin, gold, silver, etc. despite the legal-tender laws and other forms of state aggression encouraging use of fiat, says enough.
Of course I'm not saying damgem is utterly wrong. Government action (a ban, which does not seem forthcoming anyway; the FinCEN publication confirms pretty much what we already knew, that openly running a fiat-crypto exchange requires formal licensing, AML compliance and so on, which was already the case in the US and elsewhere) could certainly damage Bitcoin's short-term prospects. But ultimately, cryptocurrency would/will thrive as the lifeblood of System D online, legally or otherwise. System D (drugs, tax evasion etc.) is already criminalised, after all, and yet thrives with what? a trillion-dollar economy or probably more worldwide? (Obviously nobody knows the *exact* scale of the underground economy, by definition.)

I think it may be a similar issue to owning a nice house in a rural or semi-rural area (in particular), where there is a small but real risk of (often planned) violent home invasion by robbers who assume you have a safe containing stuff of real value just because you have a nice house. While these sorts of horrendous crimes might be rare (in western societies at least, and in the worse regions of the world[X] the robbers might just kill first and rob later anyway), I've seen a few cases like this on *Crimewatch UK* (the show that predated *America's Most Wanted*!) and in some, the victims were brutally tortured in an attempt by the robbers to reveal the location of a non-extant safe! :O
I suppose bitcoin is just another asset to add on top of cash or gold, and nothing fundamental has really changed regarding security and crime.

Unfortunately, this is not a really simple question to answer cogently (for me at least).

But all actors are free to choose to place bids or asks at just about any level they so choose.

Too bloody familiar. Though that infernal graph was designed for the stock market originally. Remember, though:
* the bitcoin bubble in 2011, viewed retrospectively, was one of the purest commodity bubbles you could get. Of course, today is not 2011.
* if we *must* try to adapt that infernal graph to today's bitcoin marketplace, we could be in more than one place on the graph depending on timescale viewed and general perspective. In other words, short term, assuming a "New Paradigm!!!" peak of $0,266/mBTC and a capitulation/despair bottom of $0,05/mBTC, we are anywhere between **return to "normal"** (bull trap) and **return to the mean** on that graph, but pan out to the longer term view and we're around the **bear trap/media attention** phase, or arguably still in the **smart money** phase preceding it. Remember, the graph was intended originally for stocks, and the second and third phases are labelled **institutional investors** and **public** respectively. Bitcoin has barely scratched the tip of the iceberg with either of those. As a $1bn market, Bitcoin has finally grown up... into a minnow!

You can't beat up on yourself too much though: hindsight is always twenty-twenty.
Had you loaded up heavily on bitcoin pre-2011, there is a fair chance you would have dumped most of your holdings during the 2011 bubble, which would've been profitable, and the possibility to buy back in under $5 also transpired. Again, the benefits of hindsight...

This market is very unpredictable. So the answer to questions about near-future prices is "no clue", I'm afraid.
The only true bear market in bitcoin existed between June and October 2011, where the price fell by 92% from peak to trough. But bear in mind that even after that collapse, the price was still four times higher than at the start of that year. While BTC prices fall periodically, the rebounds are usually fairly rapid.
There is no investment advice in this post.

Is $40-$50 the new $2?
Though this isn't 2011, and even if we are heading down for a while, it's unlikely to play out exactly as it did then (fewer ฿ in active circulation; high inflation due to the former combined with ฿50 block reward; serious lack of new buyers to soak up all the new 'coins being min(t)ed). On a linear graph, the April 2013 bubble seems to lack the final vertical "leg up" of the 2011 bubble, kind of as if the recent bubble was short-circuited at $266. At the time, I certainly (misjudgèdly in hindsight of course) did not feel as though we were at the "New Paradigm!!!" stage of a classic commodity bubble - the entrance point of the "Enthusiasm/Greed" stage (on a short-term timescale), perhaps.
With all the latest developments, I don't see any rational reason to drop below about $40-$60, but then, markets usually aren't rational. I'm definitely remaining bullish for the medium to longer term. The past cannot predict the future, but bitcoin has thus far shown the tendency to rise in price by about one whole order of magnitude every ~12-18 months or thereabouts. Pretty decent rate of return I'd say. :)

Nobody but a very small group of hard-core nerds knew about bitcoin in 2009/10.

One way they make money right now from Bitcoiners is with hefty fiat transfer fees to bitcoin exchanges, assuming they still allow transfers to bitcoin exchanges (they generally do, provided you are paying them the hefty transfer fee and not undercutting them through a TransferWise-style third-party service that piggybacks off the big banks' networks).

It is true that Bitcoin is no more a tax-avoidance scheme than cash is.
A retailer can offer their customers a small discount for making a purchase without receipt, and keep that off the books, thereby avoiding ("evading" as the State would call it) sales tax. But this practice has long since occurred using cash. The advantage that bitcoin would bring for "tax evaders" in these types of circumstance is *portability* of the tax-free earnings, e.g. the ability to ship them abroad without customs concerns (could be very useful!).

There was a company that made these very early on in bitcoin's history: Bitbills.
CASASCIUS has largely taken over that rôle, however. I could see that business or a competing one issuing prepaid cards of 100 BTM and smaller magnitude in the not-too-distant future. They could be sold in convenience stores like pre-paid phone cards. This *is* a business idea!

This is a good idea in principle, if done in addition to, rather than in lieu of, the fiat "tip". (OT: I've never been enamoured by the *service non compris* culture in the US but I suppose you can easily add a 20% tip (assuming good service) and you probably still got twice the meal for half the price compared with, e.g. western Europe or Australia.)

PayPal is not cash. If you hold a balance with them, they can (and sometimes do) seize your funds arbitrarily. Also, Bitcoin is borderless and (relatively) private/anonymous, and much cheaper to transfer.
PayPal's founder was filled with good intentions, and made a whole lot of money, but in the end he produced a flawed, centralised model which was always going to be prone to regulatory interference by the State and/or fiat banking institutions.
PayPal was once the cool kid in town, but it fundamentally sucks big time.

This will change as the bitcoin ecosystem expands. The need to switch to fiat will be diminished.
Of course retailers will mostly be pricing and invoicing in local fiat for the foreseeable future: that covers legal/tax issues and passes exchange-rate risk to the payment processor(s) and the holders of bitcoin.

Of course no one should be forced into using particular unit types.
That said, using mBTC for larger amounts is good too, especially when they are valued at a similar order of magnitude to some major fiat currencies. Electronics nerds often quote capacitances in µF, and a giant capacitor might be 1 million µF (hypothetically!). While referring to the same as one whole farad is totally correct, that isn't a practical scale for normal use, so µF is used a lot more than mF or F.
My Bitcoin-Qt has been set to mBTC display since the fiat exchange passed $0,35, and I try to think in mBTC as much as possible, but most sites still quote in full BTC without an option to switch over. The owner of Bitcoinity has recently promised on reddit to provide a mBTC display option, so some progress is being made.
@_date: 2013-05-02 20:17:20
My threshold for thinking more normally in mBTC is around $250/full BTC. But that's somewhat arbitrary ('cause it "kinda feels right"), and that's just me. But n00bz unaware of the sheer divisibility of bitcoin (let alone the fact that bitcoins aren't coins!) might psychologically be disadvantaged by the "$250+ is too rich for my blood" thoughts. mBTC FTW!

Responding to question 1, I'm surmising you're concerned about what we call an address collision, in other words, someone else randomly creates the same keypair (private key/public key/corresponding Bitcoin address) as yours. Assuming we trust our computers' random number generation capabilities (IOW they really are as random as possible), then inadvertently creating an address that's already in use by someone else is about as likely as randomly conjuring up someone else's DNA. There are plenty of similar analogies that have been drawn. In other words, an address collision like this is theoretically possible but for all practical purposes impossible so there is no specific inbuilt safeguard provided against it, beyond mathematical probability.

The majority don't wish to stupefy themselves with hard drugs. That was also true *before* prohibition.
Prohibition in the long term makes the banned commodity more expensive by restricting supply (though not demand). It also promotes the banned commodity by drawing attention to it (the "forbidden fruit").
Another good example: it was, and often still is, illegal to drive faster than 55 mph in the US. In some states, such as Virginia, you may find yourself (in theory, occasionally in practice) being arrested/sent to jail for only small violations of the limit (+20 mph). So with these severe regulations, obviously nobody would dare speed...

Difficult question but I'll hazard a guess that it's pretty tough to crack even now. BTC Guild's dominance of the mining pools is a bit of a concern, but luckily that pool is not in nefarious hands.
The network will likely soar past a petahash within a year or two.
If you want to help the Bitcoin network, even as a non-miner, try to run a full node by using Bitcoin-Qt as your wallet (and keep your computer on with the program running as much as possible). In time, this will probably require greater computing resources, especially in terms of storage space. Maybe my 300-ish gig HDD won't look so roomy by then...

That graph is a dead horse. This isn't the stock market. :P
Yes, I know we've had something of a bubble recently, and that graph is somewhat relevant. But depending on your timescale viewpoint, we can be pretty much *anywhere* on that graph right now.
It's okay to be a bear, but not based on that, nor on the history of the 2011 bubble collapse, because IMO, this bubble is neither as severe nor as "pure" as that one was. I know trend lines are about as scientifically valid as that notorious bubble graph, but if you draw trend tramlines along a certain trajectory [of Mt Gox history graph], the recent bubble touched the ceiling of the bands and the 2011 bubble flew *miles* above the trendline ceiling. The plus side of a less severe bubble is a less severe aftermath. A major dump, DDoS threats, Gox collapse and other factors helped short-circuit the recent bubble, which is probably healthier for the market than going the final vertical leg up the bubble (which could've been to, what? $500? $1000+?) then crashing 90+% to doom...

BitPay allows the merchant to take fiat on a daily basis.
In the present economy, I'd hazard a guess that less than 3% of most bitcoin-accepting merchants' sales are actually paid for with bitcoin, so the exchange risk is fairly manageable if the retailer does hold onto their 'coin.
In future, with greater adoption, the exchange rate will perhaps be more stable and less crucial (in a larger bitcoin economy) - by then it may well be *significantly* north of 10k USD per bitcoin...

If and when bitcoin is a more stable currency/commodity, its price will either be relatively very high compared with now, or zero, IMHO.
The high volatility is part of the growing pains. Even silver (and to a much lesser extent gold), a commodity market older than the Old Testament itself, is still pretty volatile despite its relative maturity.

The previous bubble was more "pure" than the recent one: the climb from pennies to $30 has a steeper angle than the recent run up to $0,26/mBTC.
In 2011 there were about half as many ฿ in circulation as today, yet were being minted at twice the rate, i.e. much higher inflation. That was coupled with a paucity of buyers, which induced the decline. The decline was slow because there was no massive selling pressure to cause a crash after the initial bubble burst.
Now, the inflation rate is considerably lower, and there is considerably more interest. That might not ward off a short-term bear market, but I doubt 2011 will repeat itself so starkly. And if we do face a similar decline, maybe $40 or $50 is the new $2. :)
There are few if any psychological walls around prices like $100 or $150 now: we've been there and done that before. Your guess is as good as mine as to when the next major bull run begins and we bubble up a whole order of magnitude or two more. I predict likely mBTC parity with the USD within 18 months, a prediction worth the pixels with which it is printed. :)

You have a point, but it should be noted that the appreciation of a commodity-type currency like gold or bitcoin is different from the (rare) deflationary periods in central-bank fiat.
Debt + deflation = a poor combination.
With gold or bitcoin, there is *no* guarantee they will be worth more tomorrow than they are today. Look what is happening right now for proof. The use of both commodities as money is strictly voluntary, too.

Not really, the April crash came pretty thick and fast, and the bottom of the July capitulation ($65ish) was actually higher than the post-crash bottom ($50).
A prolonged crash would look more like the bubble that popped in June 2011, and this bubble's nothing on the scale of June 2011: it popped way too soon for that, IMO.
If we get anywhere near as low as $200 this time around I'm selling my soul to buy bitcoin so expect the bottom to be much higher than that if we haven't hit it already. :)

Bitcoiners have seen all kinds of scams and shams through the years, so many are deeply cynical.

Why do you think anarchists and libertarians aren't paying taxes? Most of us probably are, but just want to make the point clear that we have not consented to doing so: we are being extorted, threatened with violence if we do not comply with the State's demands. (There are some examples of this on YouTube where some have filmed themselves at the local council paying property tax in cash and emphatically pointing out that this is based on violence and not consent.)
Even, or especially, anarcho-libertarians fear the violence of the State as much as or more than the next people.

Since bitcoin is money, there *are* ways to earn it, but it's no cinch in the present market.
During last year's London conference, I blogged for a few days and got tipped over ฿1 for my trouble, which was a nice little bonus. I was tipped generously when I made my first ever post on Bitcointalk. I keep a tip address for bitcoin and litecoin in my signature, but it's optimistic to expect more than a few µBTC at best these days.
I accept bitcoin and litecoin tips (or special-request payment) on my Facebook Pages, [especially this one]( but that's not primarily profit-motivated. I run such Pages at an economic loss to myself (both temporally and monetarily), but even if the Page's earnings are minimal to non-extant (which they are), they may help spread awareness of Bitcoin and that in itself is worth a great deal to me and probably others in this community.
As some cynically have pointed out, you can work for fiat and then switch to bitcoin, but it's not good form to tell anyone to "get a job" in this 1930s-type economy, really (IMO).

You can't make that judgment so soon. There's usually a consolidation period after any bubble pop in most markets.

Havelock isn't too bad, though my investments there aren't doing fabulously well ATM. The small dividend is a nice bonus.
I think the mcxFEE security sold at mcxNOW.com is pretty solid (no pun intended), and could become the "treasury bond" of Cryptoland. I'm not advocating buying these at the current prices necessarily, but a nine-to-one swap is about to be floated, so it can't hurt to hold one or two. (Bear in mind the original float price for the first 5k shares was just  ฿0,1/share.) That exchange [mcxNOW] also pays a small interest every day on deposits of any currency that it spreads (bitcoin offers the best rates).
You could try speculating a little on the altcoins too but that's risky, if potentially rewarding.

Bitcoin extracts its value from the fact that people accord it value. And the algorithm is designed so that bitcoins cannot be counterfeited.
If you want bitcoin you'll need a wallet, e.g. the legacy client Bitcoin-Qt or the online webwallet at blockchain.info. Then you can buy them on an exchange or in person via localbitcoins.com. Or, if you can somehow get your hands on the appropriate supercomputers (tricky), you can "mine" bitcoin by verifying/confirming transactions.

One thought: when an economy *enters* a depression, like in the 1930s, say (also include the slumps of the early '80s and '90s if you will), there remains a glut of excess unsold inventory, which puts strong downward pressure on consumer prices, expressed either in fiat or commodity-weighted terms. USD gained purchasing power considerably between 1929 and '33, until FDR and the Fed "did their thang" and [MGM produced a propaganda film extolling the virtues of inflation](
In the longer run, however, it is obviously true that an economy producing fewer real goods but with the same money supply should experience higher real prices and a lower material standard of living.
One thing commodity monies like gold and bitcoin can achieve if in widespread use as money, is to dampen the inflationary effects of the Fed being exported around the globe. TPTB might not like this, however...

The US are probably a worse police state than the Warsaw Pact countries pre-1989. But the sadder thing is that many people may still be deluded enough to think it's a "free" country. Not that there are any free countries, and amid the scandals of NSA spying and extrajudicial killing by the federal government, a lot more Americans are likely to be waking up. How things proceed from here is another matter...

Mycelium is a wallet/client, yes, but I haven't used it in a while so cannot remember whether or not it allows custom fees (arrrgh).
Coinbase is not a client or wallet inasmuch as the private keys of bitcoin in your Coinbase account are not held exclusively by you. Only when you are the sole proprietor of the private keys to your bitcoin is it actually your bitcoin and not a third party promising to pay you bitcoin, akin to the difference twixt gold in the hand and funds in the bank.

No, bitcoin doesn't require banks, and there is very little banking infrastructure even extant within Bitcoinia (mass adoption may change that).

If there are issues at Mt Gox (and there are), it can affect the entire market. Sure, it's not as bad as a Bitcoin Federal Reserve type of situation, but no near-monopoly is healthy.

That its long-term value might well rise if any government is stupid enough to ban it (no, don't believe the Thailand FUD).
There aren't many things that become *cheaper* when governments ban or try to ban them! Was gold a bad thing to hold in 1933 because FDR decreed it illegal for private personal possession? I'm giving you no investment advice here; I just want you to consider the meaning and implications of illegality. I mean, you're on an empty interstate, the road conditions are perfect, not a cop in sight, you're driving a nice car, fuel cost no issue and so on. There's a signpost by the road with "SPEED LIMIT 65" printed on it, and it's in a state where posted limits are absolute (IOW illegal *per se* to drive faster than the posted speed). So you drive at 55-60 mph just to make sure you don't accidentally break the law, right? Similarly, the "war on drugs" means there is no network or market for marijuana etc.?
Of whatever concerns I might have over bitcoin, the distant prospect of government restriction is not one of them, especially since Bitcoin was *designed* to be censorship-resistant (it's P2P) to begin with. The scalability questions (q.v. another recent thread in are more pertinent IMO.

Although that post is a bit of a statist troll, I don't think too many around here are promoting Bitcoin as a tax-evasion scheme. It's about as much of a tax-evasion scheme as gold bullion or Liberty Reserve.
If you do business off the books and keep mum and the State calls this "tax evasion", this is so, regardless of whether Bitcoin is involved or not.

No, I'm not particularly happy about it but neither am I sad. It's just the market playing out.

It's governments' and banksters' favoured method to raise money from us poor plebs.
Ed: this is from a UK perspective; sorry, I still thought I was reading But the principle is the same in the US and elsewhere: the banksters want to print money to enrich themselves, their corporate pals and plug the government's deficit which often gets spent on killing foreigners.

Yes, looking on the particular timescale you just cited.
I didn't claim for a second that there was *no* bubble. Far from it.
What will happen to the right of the line is still anybody's guess, though. Since this isn't 2011 - the circumstances are different now - I wouldn't expect a repeat of the 2011 unwind, even if things do dip further. Quite possibly, the $50 low that was tested after the bubble popped is now the eternal bottom, assuming no crash to zero of course.

If it's a voluntary or contractual contribution, it's not tax.
If it's tax, it is by definition, taken by force, and physical harm may result if you decline to accept this taking by force.

Bitcoin is amazing isn't it? Now, **disclaimer:** past performance can never guarantee future results.
Psychologically, I fear some noobs who don't "get" bitcoin's amazing divisibility will scoff at anywhere remotely near $1000/BTC ("too rich for my blood!"), even more so with the economy being (broadly speaking) so bad as it is.
We switch to mBTC accounting and develop *that* as the norm, then we might reach $10/mBTC sooner than some expect. The burning question will be: when will mBTC break dollar parity? Will it be bubble number three? Will bitcoin continue along those general trendlines or experience slower, sub-exponential (but still healthy) growth, possibly taking 2-3 years to reach $1/mBTC?
We are currently experiencing a short-term bear market, possibly right now being fueled by a typical holiday-period commodity selloff (peeps want fiat). I am still bullish for both medium- and long-term scales, and am somewhat confident of mBTC breaking dollar parity (maybe even index-linked rather than inflated $) within 18 months. You heard it here. :)

US (or many other countries' governments) unemployment-figure propaganda cannot be trusted, at any rate. There is minimal to no economic recovery to the depression that began in the major western economies in 2008. Funny thing is, the depression would bring some benefits (in flushing out malinvestments) if governments/banksters just left alone and let it run its full course as quickly as possible, Warren Harding style. *Then* we could see a real recovery (sans corrupt debt-based financial system of course) - yes, it's okay to dream. :)
