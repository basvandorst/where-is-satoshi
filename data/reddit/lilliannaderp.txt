You made me cry now. I had finally stopped and you made me cry.
I started with coinbase  but transferred everything to paper after they did that insider trading thing.
It just feels like the worst day of my life

Really you guys? Sometimes bad things legitimately happen. Sometimes people are lonely and it's Christmas and they'd like to talk.
You guys are so mean.
I was assigning btc and some altcoin to paper as Xmas gifts for grandkids. Ex is in house because kids grandkids are there.
EX asks what I am doing. I tell him. I move on with my day cooking visiting.
EX drunken best friend asking about how to keep btc safe..I give an overview
Etc. Go back to desk to finish getting transfers done.  everything is gone. My wallets blank wallets everything.
 Never in my wildest dreams...

What's really amusing is that my ledger nano arrived five minutes ago. 
I have recovered from a lot of adversity in my life; I'm not sure I have any bootstraps left to pull up on....

I took them (police) thru it when they arrived. They didn't understand. And there were other people in the house so I can't prove it was scuzzball. 
Doesn't matter I guess. I can't figure out what's next.

I was doing well which is how ex found out. All my ebay profits went to more btc. I don't care what you think of me. I hope you get back the level of unnecessary evil you put out.

My ex got a hold of my paperwallets. Police won't help. My little fledgling business was dependant on the profit I could pull out to get me started.
I thought...hey old granny you can do this bitcoin thing...I was so proud of my plan.
Now I've got nothing.

I concede your point. I felt like drunken friend and ex worked together. Scam came to mind before theft. I suck.
