wonder how much this cost
@_date: 2016-01-05 14:50:19
that's why i think services like libertyx.com make sense.  some store owners seem to be charging fees but still ends up much cheaper than BTMs or LBC. i'd put bitquick in that camp as well. ATMs have a lot of costs that can only be made up with high margins charged to the customer.

libertyx is in the app store. buy bitcoin instantly with cash at local stores.

i don't believe so.

i used to use bitcoin atms until libertyx.com launched. now i use them as they are much cheaper and closer. for large purchases (1K+) i still use bitcoin atms

They shouldn't need to

Could use Bitreserve for some portion if they can't afford short-term volatility risk
@_date: 2015-07-26 18:55:47
it was going to get converted to fiat after the sale in most cases anyways. allows us to minimize the amount of time we have to touch dirty fiat.

It is full reserve, not fractional reserve. Not everyone can afford the volatility risk of having 100% of their assets in bitcoin. If I need to keep some dollars, I'd much rather have it with them than a bank.

libertyx plus breadwallet (mycelium when i had android) is my preferred method...instant and you hold your own coins

Exciting! Can't wait to try it out.
