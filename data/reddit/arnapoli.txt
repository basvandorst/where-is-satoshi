Right and im assuming you think the us has printed too much so lets cut that down to a reasonable and functional amount of fiat capital. Lets imagine the us printed a healthy 5.5 trill... Thats half if its current cap.... By that (more reasonable standard of spreadable currency) in a Globalized world which requites liquidity.,, that would value bitcoin at .14cents...
So by your own metric, bitcoin could be assumed to be massively overvalued. 
For bitcoin to become a viable standard and liquid form of currency it would need at least a 2.75trill capitalization... Even then it would be worth .28usd.... 
With an 8bil mktcap bitcoin is virtually useless because of its illiquidity  
The only way to make it more useful is to make it more liquid and the only way to make it more liquid is to A. Make more of it or B. Divide it into smaller pieces which has the exact same effect on price.

Fair enough. There are definite tradeoffs between currency types. Although i would argue that the inflexibility of fixed currencies is that they can be hoarded... Which in and of itself is a form of artificial control.
But if supply remains fixed I guess you just have to hope that demand for bitcoin doesnt drop. That seems like a pretty large factor for a currency exchange rate to hinge on.
Nobody here has made any attempt to quantify why bitcoin deserves to be 600x more valuable than 1USD... All i hear is supply and demand (which makes it no different than a collectible) and future utility (which is a lot to bank on). 
I genuinely hope i am wrong for the sake of all the people who truly believe in the future of the currency. But my instinct tells me you guys are fooling yourselves.
@_date: 2014-02-25 07:10:38
it's greed. that's all it is. And it isn't too late to get out. That was the purpose of this post. Not to say "I told you so" but to say "Come with me if you want to live."
Edit: And I do sympathize with people losing money. I sympathized with them when I posted two weeks ago and I sympathize with them now. Get out. Its a giant bubble.
@_date: 2014-02-13 01:44:41


there is no hard metric that proves this.


This is true. and my whole argument is that majority of these are just speculators looking to capitalize on price appreciation. The community of bitcoin users have been marginalized and overrun since november by rampant volumes of bitcoin speculators... and that alone, I believe, is whats is responsible for the dramatic price spike.


not necessarily, because if the amount of bitcoin adoption growth is less in proportion to the number of 'new bitcoin owners' who are merely currency speculators and traders, then you could easily argue that Bitcoin is due for a crash regardless of increased vendors willingness to accept bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-02-12 07:35:47
so then... why invest in bitcoin if that's the most likely outcome?
@_date: 2014-02-12 10:29:25
in most finance the term 'intrinsic value' is understood to be relative. Its not like im saying 'There can be an objective value to this item."... im saying "what is the current value that most people can rationally justify this item to be, and whatever is left when you subtract that is "non-intrinsic" or speculative of future potential.
So im essentially asking: "of the 600USD/BTC what % of that appreciated as a result of current perceived value over the USD, and what % is based on speculators buyin, and driving up the price with demand (price inflation)."
@_date: 2014-02-12 07:18:26
ah right i assumed that scarcity has something to do with it but, what exactly about scarcity makes it intrinsically valuable. Things like famous artwork and collectible memorabilia are valuable (but highly illiquid) because they are scarce. But I wouldnt say they have any real intrinsic value. Something like fiat currency could be argued to have some intrinsic value backed by the assets and capability of their governing backer... ie: the US has armys, and infrastructure, and world trade presence which I would argue makes its currency intrinsically valuable. 
Does bitcoin have any real assets to back its value, or is it all jsut speculation and scarcity?
@_date: 2014-02-12 17:42:17
Sorry, wrote that pretty late last night. What i meant to say was : if bitcoin becomes more popular wouldn't there be pressure to produce more of it? One of the primary advantages of fiat is that it can be expanded in time of aggressive demand, in order to lower price. If bitcoin is truly fixed then that severely limits its ability to remain liquid in times if economic expansion.
 One of the primary reasons we abandoned gold for fiat was that it was more useful for creating liquidity during times of innovation, whereas gold, and fixed currencies get hoarded and lead to price manipulation.
But i was operating under the impression that bitcoin was not fixed. That supply was increasing, and that even at its hard limit it could be divided up further to avoid price inflation (which is really the same thing as printing new money).
@_date: 2014-02-12 15:55:42
haha nah i havn't yet. Although most of my friends are engineers so I can confirm that this is all true.
@_date: 2014-02-12 16:21:20


Yes. A soft definition of an 'intrinsic value' is a value that the vast majority of all market participants can agree exists at the current time. If there arnt enough price related factors to validate these claims then it becomes hard to estimate somethings intrinsic value. And if there isn't  a strong consensus, a price will be volatile. Bitcoins strong price volatility, and lack of concrete reasoning for its current price against the USD has lead me to believe that its in a bubble and that its intrinsic value is likely much lower thant ~600USD.
@_date: 2014-02-12 08:34:53
If bitcoin becomes more popular, would it not then become less scarce, and wouldn't supply cause devaluation as demand stagnates (or worse yet) drops?
And yes I've seen the charts. 
Wouldn't the sudden spike be a strong indicator of a demand spike, and wouldnt common sense tell you that for bitcoin to succeed, supply needs to increase to meet demand, and its exchange rate against the USD therefore depreciate?
@_date: 2014-02-12 08:37:19
@_date: 2014-02-12 07:58:37
I agree with this wholeheartedly... but ~600 dollars worth of intrinsic value?
@_date: 2014-02-25 07:27:41
Stocks have real assets backing their price fundamentals; Discounted Cashflows that we can at least measure. Bitcoin is a currency without an army, a country, or any civil infrastructure. It's price is driven by supply and demand alone which makes it a speculative venture. Don't compare speculators and flippers to venture capitalists and pioneers. The thing is a giant bubble. Getting involved in it may have been a genuine mistake for many people, but refusing to do due diligence, ignoring the advice of analysts from reputable financial institutions, and blindly believing is folly, not "risk".
@_date: 2014-02-12 23:42:18
Thus argument has become way to rhetorical on your part. Im not sold on it. I think its overvalued and I think people who hold it expecting it to appreciate against the USD are going to look very foolish in the long run.
@_date: 2014-02-12 07:52:50
Ok fair enough but... lets say for a second that bitcoin became hugely popular. Might the USD just decentralize itself in a last ditch effort  to prevent extinction, and would that not still be more valuable than Bitcoin considering it's backed by a real world army and infrastructure?
Obviously decentralization would be a massive blow to monetary authority... but wouldn't it be the logical last resort alternative to extinction?
@_date: 2014-02-12 20:40:10
Jesus man... take the shoe out of your mouth.
@_date: 2014-02-12 07:21:14
Thanks. Not to be rude, but I do have a strong understanding of the mechanisms behind bitcoin. Is there a part in the video where he discusses its 'intrinsic value' over other currencies? It would save me some time if I can skip right to it. Thanks and much appreciated
@_date: 2014-02-12 09:08:21
since you asked, Twitter is laughably overvalued. With Facebook its a bit more complicated... maybe... Bitcoin isn't a profit producing entity, and it has no shareholders or investors  in that sense. It doesnt release earnings reports or income statements so its not really comparable... Comparing a currencies value to the value of an equity isn't even like comparing apples to oranges... its like comparing french toast to the number 7.
But interestingly enough if you wanted to compare it, i think you would find your metric self defeating. Market cap / share price of a stock = shares outstanding... you cant use that to value a stock but with currency we can take the capitalization (8bil) / Price against USD ($659), and we get this weird number: 1,213,960.55.
That number would be Bitcoin's 'Hypothetical" number of outstanding shares IF it were an Equity Investment.
That is an Incredibly small number of shares... likening Bitcoin to something more comparable to a penny stock than anything else... I don't know any penny stocks that trade for $659 bucks per share, do you?
Of course that's based on a completely bogus valuation, since currency as i said is not meaningfully comparable to equity.
@_date: 2014-02-12 08:52:35
hmmm that is a totally plausible outcome. And please dont take this as an attack. I think this whole convo was very productive, and you obviously know what your'e talking about.
My final argument would just be that I dont trust how effectively miners could coordinate to add hasingpower in a sinch, since i think decentralizing something tends to make it less efficient.
I dont know... I think you argued your point well, but there are a lot of growth factors that have to line up for Bitcoin to get to that point, so i still dont know if the intrinsic value justifies its current price against the USD, when you adjust for all that risk. My gut just tells me its too high.
Anyway, thanks for the civil debate, I always welcome it.
@_date: 2014-02-12 07:23:18
but then doesn't the very fact that its price inflation against the USD based on scarcity, make it intrinsically worthless? How is it any different than a work of art, or collectible stamp?
@_date: 2014-02-12 08:24:28
Based on my own analysis I would have to agree with this statement. and hey, I'm not saying it isn't an ingenious concept... but from what I've heard here, its price against the USD is more likely than not the victim of a speculative bubble. Unless your trading it day to day on price volatility, you would have to be at least somewhat delusional to believe it will continue to trade at 500% times the value of the US dollar in perpetuity.
@_date: 2014-02-13 00:54:05
The notion that bubbles dont collapse and then rebound is just wrong. Every bubble rises and falls at its own pace. Some take years to do either some take months. Some take days. They go down, they go up for a while. Theres no set formula to how they collapse, but eventually they do.
And look, if you know the risks and don't mind losing your principle then i say good for you. More power to ya. Im mainly concerned for the poor schlubbs with serious money riding on an expected appreciation in the future.
@_date: 2014-02-12 09:51:16
I see. So would you argue then that the 'true' believers in bitcoin don't think USD price appreciation/depreciation is even relevant? Because, it sounds like the endgame is the total elimination of other less efficient world currency systems. 
In that case the end result is that no long-term bitcoin investor profits from exchange trading... which i guess is perfectly fine if you just believe bitcoin would be a better alternative monetary system.
Still I have to believe a hell of a lot of bitcoin investors are in it for the capital appreciation, so my next question is, what happens when Bitcoin reaches a price where 'non- believers' start cashing out for USD's?
Hypothetically, if the price of bitcoin skyrocketed to 10000USD/BTC tomorrow, would you not sell? Why would you prefer USD's when Bitcoin is safer and more valuable in your opinion? and what percentage of total bitcoin holders would sell in favor of USDs?
@_date: 2014-03-02 18:13:45
right and i'm pointing out that bitcoin may have never actually reached the despair stage. He's trying to fit the chart to the bubblemodel, when really the bubble model is better fitted to context. They are still in a long drawn out return to "normal"z
@_date: 2014-02-12 08:41:39
But if bitcoin became a dominant form of exchange on the world stage... wouldn't that make it a pretty big target from irrational nation states looking to preserve the power of their own currency exchange systems?
it just sounds to me based on what you've said that Becoming a cryptocurrency leaves you more vulnerable to attack in general.
Why favor it over fiat money if all it takes to knock it down is a higher hashingpower?
@_date: 2014-02-12 07:39:17
yea but without backing, what can you use to weigh its value against other currency?
@_date: 2014-02-12 15:57:24


right... so wouldn't dividing bitcoin reduce its value?
@_date: 2014-02-12 08:02:10
Ok but if The USD became a cryptocurrency is it possible that they have more Hashingpower behind them than the current hashing power backing bitcoin?
EDIT: Changed 'wouldnt' to 'is it possible that'
@_date: 2014-02-25 06:37:41
if bitcoin is "like cash"... what makes it so special?
@_date: 2014-02-12 08:13:43
I understand that concept very well and I agree BUT, i believe that some things are more likely to depreciate in value in the future than others.
Im basically asking: what about bitcoin makes it likely to continue to appreciate in value against the USD, and might it already have appreciated too greatly, and be due for a devaluation?
@_date: 2014-02-12 07:31:21
This right here is probably the best argument I have heard so far for its intrinsic value. But there's still just one problem. Whats to stop a major currency like the USD from adopting a similar payment network practice? If one guy could do it, why cant the US government remodel its own system the same way?
Whats more likely... that bitcoin overtakes a currency backed by real assets... or that some mainstream 'full faith and credit' backed currency just copies the kryptocurrency and outcompetes it...
@_date: 2014-03-02 18:21:54




Completely agree. Although there are a lot of really good reasons I can think of for why you will ultimately be wrong about a few of those assumptions.
@_date: 2014-02-13 00:10:55
I agree with you that kryptocurrencys are likely here to stay, or that they will at the very least lead to monetary reform. 
And look im not hoping you loose all your money. I hope i come back here in a year and bitcoin hasn't crashed and i was wrong.
 But every instinct i have tells me that very very few things achieve a 1100% return in one year justifiably, and that i havnt heard much strong justification for such an unusual return.
You should be wary that bitcoins chart follows a patter that looks very similar to every single documented bubble in human history.
Just consider Tulipomania, Roaring 20's, poseidon bubble, dot com bubble, housing bubble... They all looked very similar from a technical perspective and they all involved vague new concepts for explaining and justifying the value appreciation of their respective assets.  
@_date: 2014-03-02 18:10:55
This is a fair point.
@_date: 2014-02-12 08:05:21


I fundamentally disagree with that but i cant disprove it and you're entitled to your opinion. Its certainly no less valid than mine.
@_date: 2014-02-12 08:25:38
1 bitcoin trades for `600 USD. Isn't that enough incentive? 
@_date: 2014-02-25 07:08:05
haha I really appreciate this response man. I mean absolutely no i'll will to the people on this sub. I actually think bitcoin is an extremely interesting invention. But every time anyone hints at the possibility that it might be overvalued against the USD, they don't wanna hear it. That blind feverish greed in my opinion, and its quite frustrating to watch.
@_date: 2014-02-12 21:12:01
... No because in order for all units of known currency to be exchangeable the smallest unit of one should match to the smallest unit of another. Trying to divide your currency to fractions significantly smaller than 1 cent ignores purchasing power parity and is a big monetary no-no.  You divide 1 bitcoin into 1000 units then its smallest unit is force locked into the .001 mark of a usd in order to fairly value purchasing power parity. Thats pretty standard. You cant increase demand through divisibility without affecting exchange rate price. 
I cant believe how many people on here are ignorant of this notion that currency divisibility is NOT a loophole around printing money... 
@_date: 2014-02-12 08:08:36
so then do countries like China currently have more incentive to attack Bitcoin, than the USD?
@_date: 2014-02-25 06:33:09
what fundamentals?
@_date: 2014-02-12 07:57:43
Ok on a raw philosophical level this is true. but would you not agree that most people will pay more money for a sharp knife than a dull one. Sure theres no way to calculate an exact intrinsic value of something, but that doesn't mean the principle isnt a useful tool for determining the future direction of an assets price.
@_date: 2014-03-02 17:40:12
So here's my problem with this. He takes the bubble chart and assumes it's some kind of 'fit' model for how all bubbles should look. Just hear me out for a second:
*  &lt; Interpretation of what a bubble should look like
*  &lt; Possible fit to bitcoin price chart.
@_date: 2014-02-12 10:22:56
there is virtually no difference between infinite divisibility, and printing new money. Infinite divisibility is supply increase. I'm not sure how you could convince yourself otherwise.
Are you trying to say that rather than increasing supply, divisibility increases price? Because that's just nonsensical. 
If prices rise, the currency gets divided in order to account for purchase of smaller goods... which is the basis of value creation through new money. I'm not sure why you thought divisibility was a price driver...
@_date: 2014-02-12 21:00:47
Yea but you cant just create wealth out of thin air. Wealth should be backed by a real world central power or real world assets, since thats the only way to make a system Efficient and safe enough to create liquidity. 
Bitcoin has yet to create liquidity and can only do so through supply expansion... 
12billion bitcoins does not a market make.
Which as you pointed out, devalues currency. If you expand supply to a reasonable enough fraction to create liquidity (ie: 2trillion or so) its price is reduced to nothing.
@_date: 2014-02-12 23:19:31
There is no consensus whether Bitcoin is a currency or a commodity. Stating "ITS A COMMODITY" because some people believe it is, doesn't make it so. Its much more complicated than that and nobody is quite sure what it is yet. IF bitcoin is "just a commodity" then it is likely even more overvalued than i suggested, because unlike silver and copper and gold it has no material applications. Any other kryptocurrency could in theory provide the same function as bitcoin... So then what stops Dogecoin or any competitors from doing the same thing. Nothing, except preference. 
Real commodities have intrinsic value because they cant be interchanged ie: you cant use gold, silver, and iron to fulfill the same manufacturing purposes. (Gold is unique because it has speculative value for beyond its material application, but if anything that makes it more volatile...)
Bitcoin by definition has no material value as a commodity to back it intrinsically because it's just a protocol, and can be duplicated infinitely by competing brands.
@_date: 2014-02-25 06:53:50
... you people. What on earth makes any of you delusional speculators think that bitcoin could fundamentally justify trading for $700, $600, $500 if its not safer or more secure than "cash". Security and anonymity were really the only intrinsically valuable things the currency had going for them, and MTGOX is about to be embroiled in one of the largest bank heists of all time. You are all being suckered, and you're shouting down everybody who is trying to warn/save you. 
Bitcoin was trading on news. that's what caused its price to surge in the first place. it's still trading on news. It's one of the most obvious examples of a bubble in financial history. Wake up and smell the roses.
@_date: 2014-03-02 18:24:19
excuse the crudeness of the chart, but I believe this is a more realistic fit. 
I'm not saying this is whats going to happen, I am just saying if I were going to compare bitcoins resemblance to the bubble stage chart, this is how I would fit it.
