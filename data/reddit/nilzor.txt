What about one week after the fork?

I'd say every switch in this illustration was a revolution but..

Noob here: how can I use this segwit you speak of to do wallet-to-wallet transfers with low fees? And how low are they?

It's different because the last time hairdressers wasn't talking about bitcoin. The technology hasn't changed (or has improved) but we all know there is no correlation between tech and the price of Bitcoin
