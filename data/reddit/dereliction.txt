If we were just talking about a typical open source project, it wouldn't be understandable. The reality is that one group hopes to control the direction of the project, more or less entirely, and another doesn't want them to control it. Thus the hate and vitriol from both directions. There's a lot at stake and, in the long run, one of the factions probably won't survive the other. And who knows though--maybe neither will survive the larger market forces at work?

It's become more than just a blocksize issue. While it's easy to dismiss this scenario as needless bickering, there's two legitimate philosophies in contest that make the conflict more than just a petty dispute.
That said, I don't think a blocksize increase here would be as destructive to BCH as you or others seem to believe. We're well past the point where a simple increase is going to do away with BCH. There is no turning back for legacy, now. They've chosen this path and now everyone gets to see them, and whomever is still willing to go the distance with them, walk it.

We're on the same page except that I think BCH has passed the point you consider above. 
Had x2 not been rebuffed, it probably would have been the weapon needed to keep BCH at bay for at least a while. But BCH has since gathered momentum to the point that significant market actors who flatly dismissed it in August, are now completely on the train. That forward momentum isn't going to change even if x2 were miraculously re-tendered and made real overnight.
But you're absolutely right that adoption is the key metric for BCH's long term outlook, and arguably for BTC too. If the former continues as it has, the latter is in big trouble. I'd argue that it already is.

The easy example is Silk Road 1/2. 
Also, more or less the entirety of the American frontier. 
More recently, the majority of northern Somalia since the civil war in 1991, has also operated as a truly free market. In fact, it's part of the reason that they have the most advanced telecom network in all of Africa (and arguably among the world), because almost everyone there engages in transactions and money transfers through mobile phones. (Source: [WSJ](
**But let's clarify:** are you suggesting that no free markets currently exist, or are you also suggesting that they cannot exist at all (at least beyond so-called "farmer's market" level)?
The real issue for free markets are the constant reach (and overreach) of governments, not whether they are economic unicorns.
@_date: 2014-06-08 11:26:04
You're dead wrong. If the market doesn't solve this particular problem for Bitcoin, Bitcoin could just go away entirely, a solution the market isn't against. That's completely within it's purview, even if individuals find the notion abhorrent (and would want regulation in place to preserve their position). 
After the dust settles, other cryptocoins (or other solutions entirely) would then fill the gap Bitcoin would leave. Sometimes things get ugly, but markets do take care of things. Have no doubt.

No, apparently, that's all it takes to maintain your fantasy for what defines a free market. You've made clear your refusal to look at the evidence I've pointed out, and your insistence that free market means something other than a market not controlled by a government, so at this point, we're doomed to go in circles.

You'll have to do better than just to say it ain't so. There's no myth to the existence of free markets. You just have a skewed definition for what free market means. But you are welcome to explain how you're right and everyone else is not.
All participants strive to manipulate others toward their interest. Some are better informed and more influential than others, and therefore are able to make the market more responsive to their goals. But that competition and interaction between market actors is what makes markets functionally free and preferable to ones that have been intervened upon by governments.

Northern Somalia and Somaliland experienced little violence compared to the fierce warlordism and statist/religio-statist factions in the south, particularly around Mogadishu. You're showing yourself a bit uninformed about Somalia while also straw-manning my point. I didn't suggest that anyone model their country after Somalia; you did. I simply answered your question by providing a real-world example of a free market, which you claim to not exist.


That's because of Somalia's success building telecommunications throughout Africa.


That's just not true. For example, take the well-known Gold Rush period:


It continues:


Your proposition is just flat wrong until state influence came into the picture some time later.


That's right. Some will. Not all, but some. In unregulated markets, they can't maintain such dominance. To do that, they need government involvement. But that will to dominate doesn't make a market not free. You need to look at what free market *actually* means, as I pointed out your insistence on using a warped meaning:


Free markets are defined by lack of government control, not by how manipulative market actors might or might not be.

People used to say and believe this about the Internet, too. We thought it couldn't be controlled, that it was all too decentralized and loose. Anyone remember Barlow's eloquent [Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace](
"*I declare the global social space we are building to be naturally independent of the tyrannies you seek to impose on us. You have no moral right to rule us nor do you possess any methods of enforcement we have true reason to fear.*"
Barlow's declaration solidified what so many of us thought and felt at that time. Governments are greedy, evil things, however, and always conjure ways to interfere and constrict things they can't immediately control. Things they fear. 
We'd all do well not to be flippant about Bitcoin and the coming contest with the world's governments. That's all I'm saying. This has only just begun. We can't yet say how Bitcoin will change the world from here, even as much as it has set the stage. We should expect things to get harder and more complicated, if the Internet's history lends any evidence.

Here's my question: since anyone can start their own cryptocurrency, why isn't Mastercard making their own "Mastercoin?" 
I presume it's because they don't like the qualities of crypto-currencies and want to do away with them, rather than propagate them. This probably has some to do with entities beyond MasterCard, as well. 
But still, they have an existing framework that could implement their particular "coin" overnight. It seems the best way to beat BitCoin is to join it, so to speak. If I were heading MasterCard or Visa, this is the solution I'd frantically work to get out the door.

If it has services worth paying for, people would have no issue voluntarily handing over their cash. That's how the majority of us expect things to work in most other areas of concern. You don't, after all, want or even expect the government to be the sole provider of your shoes or your cellphones. Starting talking about law and enforcement, however, and everyone shits themselves to let a monopoly have its way with us.
And, too, governments know that they can rob people more profitably than they can actually compete, so that's what it does.

Not brokerages; exchanges are needed. 
Exchanges provide their own form of market-based regulation and attract traders from both sides of the equation (if well formed and operated). They won't eliminate bubbles but they will provide a more stable trading environment for all concerned. 
Not to mention, exchanges are conducive to information availability, which can have its own smoothing action on market interactions. 
Brokerages, for their part, have nothing to do with regulation (state or market alike), and can otherwise contribute to imbalances. A brokerage works to connect buyer and seller needs, for a profit. Bumps and bubbles can even be quite profitable for them. They make for more liquid markets, but not necessarily more stable ones.

That's not entirely true. Some people sign up for specific credit cards because those cards provide a couple % discount, or money back in some fashion. 
@_date: 2013-03-10 14:44:06


First of all, that's not why all chargebacks happen. There are legitimate customers who request chargebacks just as there are customers trying to steal. 
For the vast majority of merchants, the distribution is largely random -- thieves are not pounding at the door all the time. Thieves instead target merchants where they can gain the most, and the average Joe merchant isn't often the right or worthwhile target.
Of those merchants who are targets, they can help reduce risk by incentivizing legitimate customers to use Bitcoin and to take appropriate steps with the remaining customers who continue to use credit cards. By helping to segregate them, the merchant already has an advantage by knowing that thieves will look to use the credit card transactions. 
Merchants who have susceptible business models can only ever keep looking for ways to reduce risks. If they can lower chargeback rates on their credit card side by even a small percentage, it could mean large amounts of savings in reserve funds, transaction fees, and so forth. I'm not sure why you're so bent on minimizing the possible and very real benefits a merchant could see by integrating Bitcoin (or other) payment options into their strategies for reducing chargeback risks. 


And the people who are not will use whatever payment option is most appealing, even ones who might later issue a chargeback without an intention of theft. Meanwhile, thieves will try to use whatever method -- credit card or not -- can provide them the illicit advantage they are looking for, and there are ways of dealing with those risks as well. But Bitcoin does provide a means for a merchant to reduce chargebacks overall.
@_date: 2013-03-09 23:46:37
Merchants won't be impressed by being able to forget about chargebacks and only have to offer small incentives, such as a couple % discount, to lure customers to the payment solution? Surely there must be merchants who would be delighted with that scenario.

It still means precisely what libertarians take it to mean. Franklin was speaking in reference to the Assembly that he represented, suggesting that if the Assembly gave up its liberty to tax the Penns to establish temporary security on the frontier, that the General Assembly, and by extension those for whom it represented, would deserve neither of those things.
Whether we're talking about the Pennsylvania assembly or an individual's civil liberties today, Franklin's words engender the same substance and significance. Those willing to give up liberties in trade for security--temporary or otherwise--don't deserve either. Just because his quote is applicable beyond individual liberties doesn't make it any less valid when put into that context.

For Bitcoin transactions they can. By offering an alternate payment option to credit cards, and being able to provide incentives for doing so, a merchant may be able to reduce their risk with chargebacks altogether and, as I already said, be able to forget about chargebacks with Bitcoin transactions. That's not impressive?

To continue the church/atheist example, what you're suggesting is that wherever both people and churches exist, those who are atheists should move away because to be atheist and remain where one is involuntarily born is therefore hypocritical. 
Not to mention, you're position includes the belief that statists have more right to live as they see fit (and to make everyone else in the claimed region to live as statists see fit), than those who think that coercion is wrong whether you were born into or agree with a statist society or not.
Finally, we're not just talking about a church, but a church that will send out men to kidnap you, throw you in cage, and keep you there unless and until you "donate" to its coffers, follow its universal ordinances, and proclaim oneself as a firm believer in the religion. And the cage can be considered lucky, as some churches won't even be that generous to "offenders."
