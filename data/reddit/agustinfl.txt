There's a lot of exchanges all over the world, many of them allow easy buying. For instance, I work for buda.com which operates in Argentina, Chile, Colombia and Peru. I guess it depends on the country, but most have at least one good site.

The only thing you require to open more channels is more money, right? Does that sound unfair? Heard of proof of stake?

Buda.com, only withdrawals though

I used to think like that until I noticed there are scams that talk about Bitcoin to fool their victims (AirBit, OneCoin, etc.) I agree with OP, the community should organize and defend the "brand". Everybody expects it to be so.

Does anyone have the link to the original tweet? I'd like to give it a retweet
@_date: 2019-09-03 02:16:09
I've used this one

I believe this is not accurate, is it? According to Wikipedia "Ulbricht was convicted of money laundering, computer hacking, conspiracy to traffic fraudulent identity documents, and conspiracy to traffic narcotics." No mention of assesination

Is that Dorian?

There are few merchants accepting lightning payments right now. It is growing quickly though, thanks to instant payment and (very) low fees. Accepting Bitcoin is not enough, you need to enable a lightning network node to accept payments with lightning.
To get you started, download Eclair wallet on Android, fund you wallet, open a channel and try paying for a sticker on shop.blockstream.com

It is! We haven't had much trouble since we enabled it for our customers (at buda.com). We have yet to enable deposits though, only payments are possible atm

AFAIK it is ilegal to incite people to withdraw their money from banks, at least in Chilean law it is

Good explanation! There's a typo: with increased blocksize comes decreased decentralization or increased centralization, but not decreased centralization

I'm talking about staying out of jail while you do it, not about morality

Interesting, didn't know spendabit. But lightning network is what gets me most interested really
