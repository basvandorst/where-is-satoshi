Hey guys thanks a lot for your help. Turns out it was an error on my part. I'm sorry for the confusion. One more issue I have is I have my one deposit into my bank account has shown. However the other has not, although is says it's "completed" in my coinbase history. Sorry if this is stupid question, but I have searched the support center and found No answer. Thanks

Thanks guys, unfortunately I'm living in South Korea so I don't know how to go about filing a police report. I traced back all my steps and I definitely did not make a mistake. I feel like they definitely robbed me, to the tune of almost 900$. It was my first time using coinbase, and even though I heard the horror stories of their service I had student loans that needed to be paid. I'll never ever again use this service and suggest no one else does as well.

Also, I have no bitcoin either. So IF I did buy a bitcoin by mistake, where is it???

The reason I started a new thread was because this was for a new issue. My last thread I was confused how to transfer my bitcoin to my bank acct. and sure, so I sent bitcoin from my korbit account. I then watched a YouTube tutorial to understand how I get my bitcoin to my bank account on coinbase (first time user, usually used circle). After receiving the bitcoin I moved the bitcoin to my usd wallet. After doing that I "withdrew" the usd from my coinbase account to my bank account. I just checked coinbase account again to possibly see if somehow I made a mistake and bought bitcoin. It says "received bitcoin from bitcoin address"  ""sold bitcoin using usd wallet" and "deposited funds...my bank name." It nowhere says anything about purchasing bitcoin. Nor do I see anything on my buying history. My current balance is .53$. It makes absolutely no sense how I sold bitcoin, but they withdrew the exact amount of my bitcoin from my bank account??? If I'm doing something wrong please tell me. I just need to resolve this asap. Thanks.

Yes, it seems you are correct. I just located money In my USD wallet. I think I may have deposited money to my coinbase account from my bank account by accident. However, I still have not located the money from my deposit. It's still pending, but when it clears where will it show up? USD wallet?

Well, I read that they didn't. But technically the only thing that is South Korean is my phone number. Which is already verified, so that's not an issue. My bank account is American.

I use Korbit for the Korean side, and coinbase for the American side. I'm not crazy about coinbase, but they haven't fucked me over yet. The fees are quite high though, sometimes it kills me to see how much I lost in exchange rate and then the fees on top. I've heard Gemini is good, but I tried to register with them and they haven't responded in over a month.

I've sent two. All I've gotten in return both time was the "thanks for your note" email. Which I guess is a confirmation my email was received.

Hmm...interesting. This wait is killing me, I gotta send money home and coinbase has been really killing me recently with fees. I miss Circle!
