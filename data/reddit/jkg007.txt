I can't see any reason for it to go up right now. Most first world economies are stable with inflation in check. Until that changes I think Bitcoin is going to suffer a gradual slow decline. But when the tables turn, Bitcoin might be considered a safe haven similar to gold.

That's already come and gone.
Hope will get you nowhere.

Has nothing to do with one individual making one decision. 
It's not bullshit that a mass of human beings behave in the same patterns seen throughout the natural world that many people have recognized over and over again. It happens in investing all the time. The hard part is applying it correctly and even then it doesn't always work. I think you need to do a little research. It's not bullshit. 
Did you notice last night Bitcoin went down to 7,600 before it rebounded. Isn't that exact where the Elliott Wave predicted a support line would be.
Look at this [Bitcoin Chart matching an Elliot Wave almost perfectly](

Here's another point. Investment firms actually do take technical analysis seriously. Using it to make decisions on entry and exit points almost creating a self fulfilling prophecy.
It's not used to make the decision to buy or sell but where.

It's just trying to predict the next support level and a potential buy point. For about 15 days there was support around 10,500. That's been broken. So where is the next support level. My "guess" using Elliott Wave theory is around 7,500. That's where I would buy. Can it keep going down after that sure. Elliott Wave doesn't predict when the downturn will end just where the support levels will be along the way.
Where is your bitcoin to full moon theory posted on Wikipedia and Investopedia?  
All technical analysis is just a guess but Elliott Wave is scary how close it gets to reality. Part of the theory is that human behavior mimics nature.

I appreciate your feedback and the opportunity to have a candid conversation about weather it is useful or not.
Elliott Wave is the one and only TA that I think has any chance of being legit. I don't think things like a head-and-shoulders, flags, or cup-and-handles makes any predictive sense.
I don't care if ten people come up with ten different transition  points I believe that those transition points would be close enough to each other that it could be useful.  For me here is the moment of truth, I plan to buy at this point.
Again, thanks for the conversation. I'm going to have to go off the grid for several hours.

Interest take. It's easier to predict peoples reactions to the current market than the value of an asset in 3 months. I agree.
