It’s my opinion, which I am entitled to. If you deem it irrational feel free, there are literally millions who don’t deem it irrational and see it as a logical progression.

Bitcoin has been here since 2009. It’s not going to die. It may drop substantially but crypto is here to stay. 
And wouldn’t bother me anyway, I don’t risk what I cannot afford to lose.
@_date: 2018-01-16 19:13:55
Lol you don’t understand crypto at all.
Anyone who doesn’t research a market and invests in it is foolish.  Bitcoin did the exact same thing last year this time and the year before, jesus look at the trends. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 02:44:25
And a meteor could strike earth tomorrow and we could all die instantly. 
Pretty silly playing “what if” games.
@_date: 2018-01-16 16:10:53
However the financial elite have been pushing for a global currency for decades, this is the answer they were looking for. 
Crypto currency doesn’t threaten them at all, it hasn’t devalued their asset wealth at all. 
They will take a keen interest and act on it to their benefit, remember the current currency is fiat currency they knew what they were doing.
Bitcoin started 9 years ago, it isn’t going away. It won’t happen overnight it’s already been 9 years.

Why yes sir it is, May I have one piece of bit coin, I can offer my youngest daughter and a spin with the missus.

So many peeps panicking on here. 
I’m offering free hugs, it’s all good. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 15:15:59
You think we’re set for that heavy a dive ?
@_date: 2018-01-16 15:58:04
Their is no system that’s the beauty to it.
The reality is this though. 
Wall Street banks start their bonus payouts today and ending on the 23rd. 
It’s pretty obvious that the amount of propaganda is going to increase as all these guys want to hit the market at a low. 
You will see the coordinated buy orders come in when it hits their target price. 
Watch in a couple of weeks all will be well again. 
In the mean time smile mate, big old hug from an Aussie here for ya. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 15:49:25
Lol, Not really I love watching the selling spree and panic and buying more. 
I’ve got fuckall really so every little bit I can buy cheap is great.  
@_date: 2018-01-16 15:40:27
Well I think it’s set for 10k low, which is awesome ��. Buy more medieval.bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 14:42:39
What else is there to base te dip on ? 
Very curious ?
@_date: 2018-01-16 15:43:43
How’s this I’ll sign up if you give me 3 tasty bitcoins. Full disclosure if it’s shite I’ll tell everyone it’s shite. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 15:36:38
Na it’s all good I just banned it globally. 
Feel free to send all your useless bitcoin to me.
Free nudes for every coin. ��
@_date: 2018-01-16 16:43:57
With ya buddy, I missed the early boat just due to not getting around to it, I’ve just entered crypto, mainly ether and mining it. 
I’m not phased at all at what is happening now, I’m looking forward to be able to pat myself on the back in a couple of years. 
I’m watching bitcoin and will buy some more when I think this true dip has finished. 
However I went in to this with 10k that I am prepared to throw away. I’ve built a fairly decent mining farm and will wait it out and see where it goes. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 12:50:49
I never said it wasn’t a gamble, everything in life is a gamble that shouldn’t need to be reiterated to any adult. 
I seriously don’t understand people freaking out NOW, before December bitcoin was around 7k. It’s not crashing and there’s no reason to think the sky is falling down just because the market correction is taking place as it has done EVERY time before. 
If you held from November until now your still making a 30% gain. If you brought up at the high then yes you’re losing. 
The future of crypto currency appears just as bright as two weeks ago, Australia is following Japan in regulation laws and protections as are other countries. 
Worst case scenario here, bitcoin goes back to the underground, used for trading among those who deem it has worth as it has for years, it’s been here since 2009.
Have I brought more ? YES.
Will I be upset if the price drops to zero ? NO.
I have invested what I could afford to throw away and never get back. 
Additionally for example the Australian exchange buy orders are double market depth than sell orders. People are starting hold and others are trying to buy in and get more. Once this panic wears off the reactive traders are walking away the price will find its market floor.
@_date: 2018-01-16 16:02:08
He is obviously just dark he missed the bitcoin train so he trash’s it when he can. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 19:22:01
Lol we’re not even at the rate it was before this December boom, what are people panicking about. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 15:10:51
Yeah so just what we were expecting. 
Plus kinda funny today is the start of Wall Street bankers bonus day... 
That’s convenient. 
I hope it tanks some more so I can get some medieval.bitcoin ��
@_date: 2018-01-16 19:57:06
Jesus don’t go and play on Forex trading then. 
At the end of the day only fool invests money they cannot afford to lose.
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:58:56
Haha mining at 1.5ghs for etherium, so will be trading more for bitcoin. Keeping a nice portfolio. 
I’ve got 5k on the exchange for buying bitcoin when I feel it’s bottomed out a bit more. 
My main investment was my mine. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 15:45:36
Yes they can. Just fodder so Wall Street bankers can spend their bonuses ��
@_date: 2018-01-16 15:34:27
Really ? I’m not sick of it all, it’s great I hope they convince people to tank it. Buy more and HODL. 
I’m sitting here smiling. 
Crypto isn’t going away and nothing the banks / governments can do will stop it now. 
You’ve got to remember Japan loves crypto, they wear it with pride because as far as they consider it a Japanese national invented it. 
Dude don’t get stressed over propaganda, be happy man. This is the beginning of the crypto revolution. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 16:26:47
Yes, the same people that are going to buy it up when it drops. 
Think about, anyone with experience in trading markets that have an influence will use every tool available to buy at a low. 
It’s a pretty obvious coincidence that today is when Citigroup start paying out bonuses to Wall Street brokers, JP Morgan pay out on the 17th, Goldman Sachs on the 19th and BOM on the 23rd. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 17:21:05
You’ve gotta smile champ, my bags very small so I don’t stress I got my btc from mining Pirl and trading for BTC so I haven’t risked much. Just hope to spread a bit of happiness to others who seem doom and gloom. Have a big old hug for you too buddy.
May we look back at this chat in a couple years and smile ��.
@_date: 2018-01-16 16:27:58
Yeah I was thinking around 10k but who knows, hodl on. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 15:12:20
Hmm will they offer btc mining contracts �� 
@_date: 2018-01-31 07:32:33
Well everyone can have their opinion, bitcoins been around since 2009 and the same cycle has happened the last 3 years in a row. I expected it to drop back to November rates and continue is normal growth as it has done for years. 
But that’s my opinion I’ve invested comfortably and can afford to lose all my crypto it’s a risk and I’m holding for another two years at minimum. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 11:59:50
Yeah I’m waiting for them to drop below 10k I’m buying one of bitcoin one lite coin and some etherium and I’m not going to look at again for 10 years.
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:47:16
Good idea �� 
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:09:44
Untodl hodl. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:27:49
I do. ��
@_date: 2017-12-17 12:44:28
I smile and say I was gifted 1 litecoin from a friend (which is true). I get what’s litecoin, I explain that if bitcoin had a brother no one likes it was litecoin. 
I sitting here with my one litecoin and farming ETC with my gaming machine. Nearly got 1 ETC yay!!!
@_date: 2017-12-17 14:40:42
Cheers I’ll give a crack ��
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:31:50
This going to happen regularly. Big players are going to manipulate this like forex. 
Set your low buy orders and high sell orders follow the trend that just happened. If your a short term player. I’m a dirty hodler so I just buy. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:04:14
Smart people don’t cash out now at all and keep buying in the dips. HODL.
@_date: 2017-12-23 17:33:44
Wait anyone who’s hodling wasn’t even looking at the market yesterday or today.
@_date: 2017-12-17 16:02:44
Well it makes around $8 a day. 
When I’m gaming I just turn off the 1070 and leave the 470s running.  Then turn it back on. 
Figured well why not when I’m not using the PC May aswell. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 14:30:46
Like a few days. 
Just got 1070 and dropped in a couple of 470,s.
ETH getting around 87MHS
@_date: 2017-12-17 14:31:11
What miner do you use ?
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:15:13
Lol I think you got this covered ��
Don’t know what he was trying to imply.
@_date: 2017-12-23 17:47:00
Good point.
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:45:19
Great choice of video. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:05:49
What ? Mate hodl. It’s that simple. 
Don’t sell now just sit it will go way up. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 17:48:14
Yeah I love it. Fingers crossed it hits bitcoin levels. 
I dunno if I’ll ever get a bitcoin with the way it’s going but time will tell. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 17:45:46
No sorry that’s $8 a day off the entire setup. 
I’m dual mining ETC /  Decred. 
Both seem to be the most profitable. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:01:03
Yeah I’m a very late adopter. I am literally just buying in every dip and buying a BTC - ETH - ETC - LTC - Ripple. 
I’m holding for atleast two years. 
All risk but a nice spread so hopefully one of them pays out well. Personally I think BTC will go over 100k but time will tell.
Loved watching that crash and watching panicky sellers. Was hilarious. So easily manipulated but I’m used to seeing it from forex trading. 
My buy orders are in for the same lows as today. If they drop further I’ve got additional buys at another 25% below. 
When your hodling you just want more medievalbitcoin.tapestry 
@_date: 2017-12-14 06:09:29
This is awesome in the true sense of the word. 
A good idea might be supply some funding to science programs such as climate studies and advanced astrophysics programs to better the human race. 
Just an idea !
@_date: 2017-12-23 17:46:47
True, I was more referring to the scared look in the meme, if you were hodling you were smiling like fuck going buy buy buy. Give me that cheap medievalbitcoin.tapestry.
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:54:34
Ahh ok.

@_date: 2017-12-08 07:32:21
So what’s the best site to buy bitcoin and what’s the best way to store bitcoin ? 
Is online wallet or offline best ?
@_date: 2017-12-17 16:04:11
I just use the claymores dual miner.
Pretty simple and tons of you tube videos how to get it running. But hey I’m not an expert at all just a fellow noob.
@_date: 2017-12-17 14:33:26
What wallet are you using for VTC ? 
@_date: 2018-03-08 02:47:27
My retirement plan right there. 
@_date: 2018-03-04 23:52:31
I’m seeing a large amount of BTC buy orders now on BTC markets, not many sell orders seems some people are thinking there’s another peak coming. 
@_date: 2018-03-02 02:22:28
Yeah dump that Btrash for real bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-02-04 20:41:22
Umm if you ignore the December boom entirely bitcoin is still steady. 
@_date: 2018-03-04 23:55:09
I’ve offered my staff the option of being paid in crypto, only 1 has taken this offer up. 
He takes 50% in crypto and 50% in fiat.
@_date: 2018-03-09 06:30:24
Haha he still had 100BTC left. He’s already a multi millionaire after December. 
@_date: 2018-02-11 11:59:25
Is this over a Cash advance charge when using a credit card to buy crypto ? 
If so well it’s not your money. It’s credit. Surprised their allowing crypto at all with CC, many have banned it entirely.
@_date: 2018-02-07 02:34:32
Or maximise his gains. 
Trillions were just wiped of the US stock exchange, all shares / securities / bonds or crypto are risk. 
@_date: 2018-02-07 03:01:12
Yes I agree. 
I mine so for me it’s like free money, I’m lucky I get free power so it’s all ++ for me. 
I have brought with cash an initial 4K investment and even in this “crash”my port folio is over 25k. 
@_date: 2018-02-07 02:32:36
How can you call it a crash ? If you ignore the entire December hype it’s trending upwards from November before the bitcoin hype. It’s called a correction after bubble not a crash. 
If dropped below September October November norms then yes you could speculate a crash. 
66 million tons of grain was just traded between the US to China using crypto from one of the biggest US exporters. 
Corporations have already invested Billions into crypto, it’s here to stay mate. 10 years of crypto and it’s finally coming to fruition. 
@_date: 2018-02-07 03:08:05
I do. The price will be 1BTC = 1BTC.
It’s never changed. ��
@_date: 2018-02-05 08:13:08
Lol I do not see news.bitcoin.com as a valid nor trust worthy source.
@_date: 2018-03-09 01:54:11
Are they going to reimburse the people who lost coins ? My best friend lost 100BTC in that hack.
@_date: 2018-03-05 00:16:15
And bitfinex is one exchange. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:58:28
This is going to be very apparent, big money can cause major movements in the markets, which allows them to start a free fall selling at the top and watching the reactive sellers follow them down, simply hold until their trigger point is hit them buy up all the bitcoin again, slowly they increase their market share and holding. 
@_date: 2018-02-11 09:52:39
Well my understanding is there’s no proof that Satoshi isn’t just a stick man for a conglomeration. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 23:05:28
Yeah but ETH isn’t an ICO anymore.
@_date: 2018-03-04 23:56:58
This don’t be scammed into Bcash (Btrash) or bitcoin gold.
@_date: 2018-02-07 02:47:53
Yet it’s high level career for millions of people.
My very good friend has been day trader for the last 10 years. Buying shares and selling them. 
He has increased his net wealth over 5000%. 
He started crypto day trading a year ago and has done very nicely, he sold his position at the high and yesterday brought back his identical position to his November holdings. 
Trading is trading in any market crypto is barely different to the stock exchange.
@_date: 2018-02-05 00:26:37
Yeah I totally agree ICO are scams, still not understanding why ETH will take a hit and BTC won’t. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 20:29:38
Jesus what a load of shit. 
This guy has no idea. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 20:38:09
What gives you that idea ?
@_date: 2018-02-02 09:12:55
I think it’s a natural market correction, fairly surprised it’s going this low, and looks to go less. Which honestly is good for me as I haven’t invested a lot in bitcoin. I mine etherium with a 1.5ghs farm and have traded some ether for bitcoin but not even having 1BTC yet. Only 0.2 at this stage. 
So as it’s drops lower I will wait for the first sign of recovery and buy up a few as I believe the next bubble will be in two years and it will make this bubble look small as previous bubbles did in bitcoin. 
Etherium is still way above November prices it was $250 and it’s still at over $800.00US.

I'm sure I'll get an answer, whether I like it or not will be the question. 
I just can't believe he sold now, it's just starting to rise. It's still HODL time. 
I've downloaded the transaction history from BTC markets and preparing for a potential civil case.
@_date: 2019-05-15 13:53:20
I'm not sure on the legality as he was a partner and I'm sure it would be a civil case. 
I'll see what our mutual friend comes back with.
@_date: 2019-05-16 03:18:19
@_date: 2019-05-15 18:12:28
We share the trading account on exchange, I can see the sell order logs and fiat withdrawal.
@_date: 2019-05-15 18:20:42
Yes, we both have agreed autonomy on trading coin pairs but no fiat withdrawals unless emergency but even then only if he couldn't get hold of me, I can't think of an emergency that he needs 130k cash.

@_date: 2019-05-15 19:07:03
Well only an hour or so until my friend pays him a visit. If it is worse case scenario then yes a police report will be filed and my lawyer will act quickly.
@_date: 2019-05-17 03:43:00
He has said he will pay me back, I stated don't worry about it, now is not the time to be talking about money. I'm sure what he has left after the costs. 
We had always agreed an emergency is acceptable to withdraw. I don't see it as theft and neither does he. Its a loan.

@_date: 2019-05-15 18:11:03
Yes, I should have set it up like that.
@_date: 2019-05-16 15:28:26
His mind is completely understandable, I feel horrible. I'm going to delete this post as I don't want him to stumble across it someday.
@_date: 2019-05-16 15:21:10
For your information it's not a con, I will be attending the funeral. There's posts on Facebook and it's a massive loss to everyone.
The crypto is completely irrelevant now.
Children have lost their mother, my friend has lost his wife and I have lost a dear friend. 
Now is not the time to be concerned about money.
@_date: 2019-05-15 18:16:19
Once I hear from our  mutual friend who is heading there in next couple of hours I will plan my avenue of attack.
@_date: 2019-05-15 18:15:12
Bingo, I'm just waiting on our mutual friend to go to his house. I should have an update in next couple of hours.
@_date: 2019-05-15 18:17:47
Yeah, we have been storing on exchange wallet and sharing that and I don't believe it has multi Sig on the exchange.
@_date: 2019-05-16 15:22:37
I can tell you, you're 100% incorrect.
@_date: 2019-05-15 18:12:52
I really hope it doesn't come to that.

Well moving state across country and such and I replaced my phone a couple months ago and hadn't put the mining monitoring on this one yet. 
We've been trading successfully for 18 months and no warning signs. 
Very out of character for him, so I'll wait until my friend goes to his house. 
As it was 50% his, I've potentially lost 65k, He covered power I supplied the mine and paid for the solar panels on his house.
