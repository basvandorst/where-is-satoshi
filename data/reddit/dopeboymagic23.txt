i had no issues with them so far but still felt a bit slow and in what way is it secure tho the seller can just run away with the money.
Then you have all sorts of problems to deal with.

sounds like what i want but never heard of it? Are they legit? Did u buy from germany?
@_date: 2015-01-28 18:59:25
yeah i guess i check out the other options for me aswell
bitcoin.de just doesnt feel right. Circle looks way better so does kraken/bitstamp

thank you will check that out

is that so? why? any sources? i used it before for stuff like Steam for example and never had any issues with it.
@_date: 2015-01-28 19:49:21
yeah i can use it without any problems if i turn on Zenmate
if u live in germany you really need Zenmate cause we are getting nazi'ed the fuck out of lots of services around the world.

true ... i mean i dont expect to get scammed there and i only bought from trusted sellers but its still not 100% secure :P

yeah mycelium looks great so far. I found some local things for me. 
Are there lot of offers on localbitcoins or is it rare? Since i have to use a proxy i assume not a lot of germans use it.
