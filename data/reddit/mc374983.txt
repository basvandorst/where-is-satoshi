Also just a store of value - lol. As opposed to some of these shit coins that are nothing but a tech demo
@_date: 2018-01-18 23:19:18
It’s released now, just not safe for masses yet
@_date: 2018-01-04 05:15:19
The price has bigger swings but that doesn’t mean it’s more likely to double at the end of a certain time frame or any time frame.
@_date: 2018-01-22 17:18:56
it cost $2.80 to open the channel, which you can continue to use over and over again. I really don't see people opening too many channels or closing existing ones, unless huge amounts were on there (which you probably wouldn't use this for anyways)
@_date: 2018-01-02 15:25:55
Lol lightning isn't going to solve adoption issues - no coin has really done that. But lightning will make using bitcoin better, cheaper and faster. So an improvement. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:45:09
you only lose money if you sell. It's going to rebound, just takes time. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 21:07:20
Lol these people
@_date: 2018-01-01 16:28:27
Do you understand how lightning works? Each user leverages all active channels and the network searches for a way to get your payment through. So you could really just open one channel with someone or something and it would be enough. For small transactions/purchases I think this will be great, very cheap transactions with huge capacity.
Yeah I think they’ll be some use cases...
@_date: 2018-01-16 14:39:44
buy buy buy!
@_date: 2018-01-04 05:30:20
It’s not more likely to happen - it could happen with less capital, doesn’t mean more likely.
@_date: 2018-01-22 17:33:52
Yeah - that was dumb. 
@_date: 2018-01-21 18:49:32
It’s sarcasm. He showed a current map of lightning already working, so it’s obviously not 18mo away.
@_date: 2018-01-04 04:36:32
I’m saying all these coins are only popular because they are cheap ...
@_date: 2018-01-09 04:09:49
All these alts are going to crash and burn. Everyone will rush to btc.  I’m guessing obviously. But Nice thing is they have to crash through btc gains No other way 
@_date: 2018-01-09 01:48:15
Don’t buy shit coins like Tron 
@_date: 2018-01-02 18:36:53
both are worth less then a cent. So good luck
@_date: 2018-01-04 04:21:11
Lol I’m not mad- just in shock. Who is buying these things thinking they are good holds? If no one is, they are going to tank correct?
Also I think it’s funny people think certain coins are good buys based on if it’s cheap or not. There could be a bazillion out there, but under $1, great deal!
@_date: 2018-01-04 05:20:23
I’m slamming the fact whatever alt has the lowest price seems to be making the biggest gains- don’t you see that?
@_date: 2018-01-04 05:12:02
I’m not saying it’s not profitable or not easy- I’m just saying long term these coins still need to hold a shit ton of value.  For ripple to get to $10 in theory assuming the same amount of coins being actively traded or liquid in the market ethereum could get to $4200. 
So like yes I realize the one is more likely then the other but actual people holding will need to sit on that money or massive price dips will happen. 
@_date: 2018-01-04 04:27:03
Oh boy - That’s false. It depends on the amount of coins.  Whatever chain has less coins at the time would be easier to get 100x because there is less capital needed to go up . A Trillion coins to go up $1 will take 1 trillion dollars and  a million coins going up from $10 to $1000 would cost 990 million. It would be 100x easier for the more expensive one to move up 100x. 
The pride thing you are probably right- but it’s dumb. 
@_date: 2018-01-09 01:33:23
I was just thinking might be a time to flip eth myself...
@_date: 2017-12-31 02:42:08
Aka every other alt coin? Btc will figure it out before the rest of em
@_date: 2017-12-25 03:05:10
Any chance my shapeshift from Tuesday is still in the backlog? I chose precise and don’t think I screwed anything up (I doubled checked it, and have shifted successfully before)I have a wallet address but no tax id. Had to move that bcash to btc when it was .25btc 
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:46:56

@_date: 2017-12-30 14:12:25
I could see litecoin adopting lightning first due to their team being a little more centralized and nimble when it comes to implementing.
@_date: 2017-12-27 12:32:48
It’s what I would have. I think Coinbase should have minimum buys of $100 until they get their shit under control. Tons of people buying a few bucks worth doesn’t change the price much, whens there’s whales moving 200 btc around regularly. 
.08 from a few years ago is what- a dollar or two now?
@_date: 2017-12-27 01:16:45
Dude I know- my cousin was telling me he invested $12 in btc, and $12 in ltc and he’s 30, I was like wtf why even bother
@_date: 2017-12-25 14:33:59
Yeah the bch one is confirmed and everything. I’m thinking maybe they put the fees to dust because I hit precise?
@_date: 2017-12-18 16:01:54
Not a bad idea - kind of what Dash is doing. Problem I see with them now it's very expensive to spin up a master node ($100,000+ now). But some sort of slight comp should be granted to node operators.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:32:03
At $8500!?!? Sell sell sell sell

Dudes he lands on the up side. All that matters!
@_date: 2017-12-25 14:10:49
I did, no reply. More just wondering if it’s possible
@_date: 2017-12-24 19:45:55
Is it possible my shape shift from Wednesday is still in pool? I choose “precise” although there was a time-out? Any ideas?
@_date: 2017-12-24 02:59:25
Yo da real mvp!
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:12:48
Sell bcash! Sell sell sell
@_date: 2017-12-27 12:28:57
If you only bought $12 you don’t have coins you can send around- fees are too high and could be more then $12. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 18:07:26
If the client knows or has/had access to private keys they aren’t private. They could swipe those funds at any time.
@_date: 2017-12-25 03:08:29
They forked it - it’s called bcash. What else do you want? It would have to be a hard fork anyways- so exactly what happened is the only way it could have played out really anyways! The big hard forks still run both chains- see eth classic, pivx, etc. that’s what I love about the b cash folks who bitch about bitcoin- stop bitching and do your own thing- prove its better, you got your wish and your value , let btc do its own thing. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 02:57:40
South Korea- sounds like something North Korea would do!
@_date: 2017-12-27 01:14:35
I’m over it too! Let bitcoin and bitcoin cash both do their own things! Free market- better for the consumer!
Like I get both sides think they are right - but how  could the situation be any better for either side- a hardfork was going to create two chains, so pick which one you believe in and stick with it. Big blockers got their solution and small blockers can do their thing. Since a hardfork was required to have bigger blocks, I don’t see how this could have went any better...
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:57:26
Increasing the block size would create another hard fork and new coin... so basically exactly what happened with bcash. 
Correct me if I’m wrong- but i don’t get what the bcash people want, could anything else have happened differently? It could be more accepted I guess but really not much change 
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:22:32
I love this gif . It's funny and a great anaology to bitcoin. 
He slides down and hits a bump and stops for a second, before hitting another huge bump and falling off the slide.
Then the best part happens - he lands on the esclator up side. As many slides and bumps bitcoin takes - it always lands on the up side. Remember that!
@_date: 2018-05-03 17:57:45
I think nano is a cool idea, so don’t take this as hate but are we sure it can scale for different uses? Yes I know transaction per second can be high, but what about large payment processors? Won’t they all have a ton of work to process to do if they are solely transacting 1000 transactions a minute? Vs another system where that work is outsourced and given to the cheapest bidder?(bitcoin)
Do the economics of nano make sense? Honest question 
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:06:41
Lol they don’t let you trade when the system isn’t working. 
@_date: 2017-08-07 16:04:49
Haha too true. But itll get easier, honestly i think a lot more people would have it if it were easier to get involved.
@_date: 2017-08-29 12:45:26
Dude, lite coin is for burgers and fries!  How many times must we remind everyone!! Lol
@_date: 2017-08-23 11:31:01
Burgers and beer are litecoins thing! 
@_date: 2017-11-07 14:42:53
Oh for sure I'm being a little rediculous. But I mean bitcoin going to $7400 or whatever it was was a little optimistic and rediculous. So why not again.
I doubt it goes to $0 - nor does anyone on these forums but it's a possibility. In my opinion it's going to be moon or bust honestly.
@_date: 2017-11-26 23:36:06
Mining is different because it’s more of a business than investment capital gains tax. Like theoretically you could write off computing power, electricity, depreciation etc. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 22:15:07
It's still very possible, don't base it on this math. I wouldn't base it on currency it's an asset not a debt. People will use it to store value. 
My estimates - 12k end of 2017, 75k end of 2018. 300k eoy 2019, 1mil 2020. That or $0, with $0 being a strong possibility ;)
@_date: 2017-11-02 14:15:59
I don't think your trading strategy is necessarily bad - but you are still gambling. Buying and holding is investing and will work better 50% of the time and 50% it'll do worse. I prefer just to buy and hold, not try to outsmart myself. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 22:56:28

@_date: 2017-11-03 21:38:11
Of course it's suspicious - the price is insane. But more and more people are getting into it every day. More and more transactions. Adoption is happening, just maybe not as fast as you think it should...
@_date: 2017-11-02 12:44:25
Most yes, but some will still be a great investment. Bitcoin is just shining right now, let’s enjoy it. No need to panic on Alts.
@_date: 2017-11-15 04:10:56
Wait can you send it to a wallet? 
@_date: 2017-11-07 14:44:03
ha yeah true. But bitcoin pricing more closely resembles stocks then it does currency. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 16:46:04
They were onboard with 2x before they were even doing 1x that’s the biggest joke of 2x. 
I’m glad you are calling them out. Segwit total adoption is the first step imo. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 05:41:41
And dip over!
@_date: 2017-11-03 16:11:02
seems like an expensive gamble...
@_date: 2017-11-10 17:12:31
They might be rich but mining is very expensive. Their profit margins are narrow. Like any company you have a lot of payables, people, equipment, electricity over head etc. They don't just hold all the money. 
Same reason amazon doesn't own "all the money"
@_date: 2017-11-03 15:54:35
bch isn't going to do shit long term. Miners jump in an out when the block rewards change. All they are doing is inflating the coin faster by giving larger block rewards - this will lead to deflation of the price in the future. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 21:29:29
people lose their bitcoin every day, and unlike cash it can't always be "found"
@_date: 2017-11-10 17:45:13
Lol no it’s not correct.  Mining is a business like any other..
@_date: 2017-11-03 21:44:35
I mean I guess I agree - but the one thing that the price isn't going to do is stay put. It's going to go to nothing or to the moon. No chance it stays in this 1k-10k range by end of 2018. IMO just depends what you're willing to risk. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 19:22:45
my first purchase was ETH at 300 then it dumped to like 150. It was miserable. 
Don't worry if your in it for the long haul, itll come around (always does)  :)
@_date: 2017-11-06 21:46:33
I don't think using the worlds cash as your denominator really makes sense. Bitcoin is more of an asset than a debt or bank note at this point.  If the new york stock exchange has 15 trillion in it, and bitcoin grew to 10% of that,  it'd put the value at 70k (10x what it is now).  Id say that's very reasonable. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 15:57:00
Do your thing, my opinion is just my opinion. 
Trading is gambling not investing. Some well connected people are very good at it, that doesn't change what it is. Some people are very good at poker too.  If you've been holding BTC since 2012 - no reason to gamble your lambo away ;)

makes more sense than "hold to the grave" no point in having money and be dead!
@_date: 2017-09-19 02:47:14
I think the graphic is pretty accurate. And my biggest reason we arent further along is liquidity. Its still hard /confusing to get in. Coinbase is the best option, and its slow and expensive (but simple) once this changes more people will be involved. 
Once a non techie person can comfortably get in with minimal effort and have the desire to do so besides some get rich scheme, we'll enter "early adopters"
@_date: 2017-09-30 22:21:58

Exactly. No one is buying, the price will be $0.  Dont even worry about it
@_date: 2017-10-10 01:29:38
The fork probably wont be worth dick. So unless you have a shit load of btc, it may not be worth the risk. I doubt this coin is worth more thab litecoin, and if so doubt itd be for long...

Moon/lambo in my mind.
If any idiot is actually buying 2x coins (doubtfull) itll just bump btc higher. All the whales, big investment brokers and tech savy types will sell quickly and put back into btc or alts. I dont see how the price gets lower at all...

What I don’t get is what he expected to happen? Bigger blocks required a hard fork- it happened successfully. How could a hard fork be called bitcoin when it’s not backwards compatible with existing bitcoin. It doesn’t make sense. Sure vitalic did it- but no one in bitcoin has that level of power. 
@_date: 2017-10-04 23:51:04
Its not great, but neither are those awful exchange rate kiosks at airports etc.. so i dont expect it to be any better than that to be honest.
@_date: 2017-07-20 23:34:04
Yeah but realistically its either an investmemt which you hold or a gamble you could have won this time. Its like playing poker, cant say should have played this hand every time it hits. Just gotta be in the game.
