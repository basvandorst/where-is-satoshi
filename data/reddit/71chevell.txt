Which exchange? I dealt with one that admitted they don’t actually have the coins, they basically are just middlemen. Your coins are secure in cold storage, not their cold storage tho. Took over a week to get mine out onto my hard wallet. Lost out in some alts I wanted.

I’m 52. I make pretty decent coin. Had jammer last year. Realized the best I had to look forward to was paying off what was left of my mtg, and some in saving and rrsp (401k in Canada). Said fuck it took out a second and bought 10 at 8000 usd. Yeah, not so worried about work or mortgages now..........wasn’t a gamble, researched it for 3months off and on, bought the tech and the adoption trend. Think we will be o fuckin k!

Well either you believe this is the edge of the future or you don’t right?if you believe and it’s past record bears that out, you go all in as you can right? No pain no gain

Worked for me. Took out 92k and it’s now worth over200k even with my screwing up a few trades. Just had to learn to hodl the hard way.  3 days after I bought China banned it. Oh boy........

Uh .... if you were Escobar , well , you’d be kinda dead. Just saying.

Either way, it’s still shady business. You pay one way or the other.

So if they make the money somewhere else it’s not “free”. That’s called bait and switch .
@_date: 2018-02-02 00:39:59
No, that’s called leverage.

Doesn’t the profits in mining follow the price of the asset ? Kind of seems it would , at least in my mind....

No , it didn’t. “ Illegitimate uses “. More of the media spreading fud for sensational headlines. Forming a committee to regulate it in some way, well that’s hardly going to attract much attention.

I agree, politicians, they HAVE to say something about it, even if it is basically nothing.
