Point me to the statute or law that states insider trading in cryptocurrency is a crime. Also tell me what class crypto specifically falls under. If it doesn't break a law, it's not a crime by definition.

What have you done? HODL'ed? Nice one! Really spreading the adoption and use case! Nothing I said is untrue.

I don't know about others, but I hate fractional reserve banking. Banking in itself isn't inherently bad.

It should take about a week. For large deposits, I found it helpful to contact the bank to pre-approve it, because sometimes they hold the transfer in case of possible fraud. A message to support wouldn't hurt though.

It's a possibility I don't understand it 100%. It is a complex matter after all and to call myself an expert would be some serious dunning-kruger. 
Maybe you could say I'm more averse to fractional reserve banking without a stable backing (e.g. the gold standard) to control hyperinflation.

You clearly don't understand how exchanges work. Those are all internal trades. They don't take place on the main blockchain.

Hmm, I don't have a link, I'm sorry. 
Imagine it as if there were a ton of people in a room trading candy. It's not until they leave that room and bring the candy to another room does it require writing to the blockchain.
Maybe a google search would help, but that's how exchanges are able to transfer value at instantaneous moments vs waiting for each trade.
