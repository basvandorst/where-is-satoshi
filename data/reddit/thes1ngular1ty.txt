When I started buying crypto coinomi was the first wallet I used. The fact that I hadn't been hacked+simple and friendly UI led me to this decision. One month later I took out all of my money and I deleted this. The reason is that I couldn't transfer money when I wanted. Connection issues were the reason. A lot of people had that problem. Actually I moved them out through myetherwallet cause I couldn't do it with coinomi. Recently I heard it's not open source now. My personal experience in one word: sad.

When you invest in a technology having no idea how it works and what it represents you panic when the markets go down. Markets always go up and down. Science doesn't. 90% percent of the people in here have no idea what a merkle tree is. Its really sad that bitcoin's reddit right now is all about the price and trading.

Mathematics is the core of science. Its the purest and deepest form of science. We won't get anywhere with this you are right

Bitcoin isn't internet money. Money is just an application of bitcoin. I agree on the second part

Let's see,
When a bank pays you to created FUD you obviously have a big audience. Otherwise they would not mind working with you. If you have a big audience on YouTube we all know that you make a pretty nice amount of money per month. So it's not that you need the 30K to cover basic needs. You take them cause you want to make more money, not really caring about the content you put out. So I guess dignity is an unknown word for some people.
