Okay that's true, but you are stilln ot understanding that the amount of gains being made overall from everyone who sold ont he way down above the original $1000/BTC would be like PRINTING a mass amount of fiat all at once. Alll those gains are money that NEVER existed before, and is suddenly all at once being introduced into the fiat reserve and would thus massively inflate the fiat and devalue it.

DATES PLEASE. 
WHAT ARE THE DATES OF EACH FORK?
Also, please recommend how to best get our duped coins from each fork!!!
If I am say, holding privately in BreadWallet.
Do I just wait until after the fork dates for when BW devs give word of a way (or new app by them) to recover the forked coins we got? Do I move everything back to CoinBase if they are supporting the forks?
Lemme get dat info guys!
Also, forks = market surge. Hold on people, we're going to blow this bubble up even more!!

I'm talking in USD though. I'm saying like what if I am day trading and have sold 6x over the year and made $1000 GAINS each of those times and sent it back to my bank in USD. That's $6000 that I owe taxes on.
But what happens if on one last sell, I lost $6000, making it so that again I withdrew in USD but OVERALL I made $0 total.
Am I still expected to pay taxes on the $6000 in gains because those were gains when they got sold, or do they let you factor in the one $6000 loss and call it a wash and you owe taxes on $0.
OR do they make you pay taxes on the $6000 gains, and maybe let you file the loss separately, but you don't get back the full amount of losses (or investing in anything would be 100% non-risk lmfao), i.e. you pay say 15% on $6000 which is $900 and then get back say like $300 for your $6000 loss, then that means even though you earned $0 OVERALL, you end up paying $900-$300=$600 just for selling so many times instead of selling all at once for a $0 gain.

3 months ago I placed a .800 bet to win .500, on a Red Sox game. 
They won 8-2.
I sold my 1.3BTC at like $4600.
I have been fucking around ever since and keep selling, because I was just using the coin as a medium for my actual money making on gambling.
Now when I win, I don't sell. I just keep hoarding it into my private wallet because I thought 10k was maybe a possibility in 2018, but here we are nearing 17k again in 2017, and I now no better.
Does it suck to think I could've won like $20k after starting out investing like $500 instead of the like $5k I've totaled in gains?
SURE DOES, but that's shitty logic to think I've somehow lost even though I won 5 grand.
I'm a happy camper. I never would've dreamed of this.
Also, bitcoin growing massively hedged a lot of my gambling LOSSES along the way, making it very easy to stay in the game, because I would always calculate my bets based on current rate so that I felt more like I was gambling with fiat.
I.e. if one day .01 was $100, I would play a bet for .01, but if tomorrow the price for $100 was .0025, then I wouldn't still bet .01, i would bet .0025. Making it so I had to bet less and less of a % of my bankroll to still place the same size bet, and if I lost, it wasn't nearly as bad of a hit since I should've lost say 300% more than I did (given the example I've written).
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:47:28
You buy for $1000. They get $1000, you get your crypto. You sell for $10000, they only have the $1000 you gave them to begin with, so they need to foot the bill on the extra $9000. Multiply that by millions of market consumers and everyone selling at once, you really think they have enough $9000 payments to pay everyone back at once if it happened? You are the one thinking wrong sorry. Get a masters.

It's not only greed but it's the  gambler's sin.
Too too too many people at this time are coming out with stories like this and it instantly makes me know they have never gambled in any format for more than a piddly amount of money in their entire life.
If this was a fucking casino, they would buy back in and lose everything trying to chase what "could have been".
Fortunately it's not and buying back in will only net them MORE gains.
So sad.
@_date: 2017-12-01 18:30:30
Well I was being hypothetical about most of it, but I actually do hold in BreadWallet.
When you say keep you coins on your own wallet, that's what you mean right?
I think BW has a Bcash app nowadays, and I would expect they would do the same with these forks over time to make it so any BW users could recover their duped coins in the future.
Am I correct?
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:42:43
That' not FUD necessarily! It has many of the same aspects.
Tons of stories of people chasing "what could have been" when they were already winners (JUST like bad gamblers who lose everything) and then losing a ton more because they get back in and then day trade to try and get their position back, or panic sell yet again, and it just keeps compounding and they end up a loser (losing money, not actual losers in life...) when in reality they were a winner if they just reinvested what they had gained and kept earning more.

I've done it a good 25+ times in the past few months.
In fact, I just did it last night.
I had .288 on Gdax and sent it to my breadwallet. 0 tx fee. I get my entire .288 and bit-change in my wallet, whereas if you sent that same .288 off coinbase, let's just assume a .001 fee, you would end up with .287 in your private wallet.
Simple example there. Go through Coinbase, you end up with less. Go through GDAX, you get exactly what you had on the exchange transferred to your wallet.
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:47:18
Or I'm just really good at gambling lmfao.
I made .150 last night alone.
It's nothing new.
I can lose 1BTC in a week, make 3 the next week.
Shit is liquid to me.
I already cashed out 10x my initial investment of $2000. (sold 1.25BTC at $19500)
I am on house money and have plenty of it to fuck around with.
If I lost it all in a months time I wouldn't even be phased.
Gambling isn't for the weak. That's why dips don't even have an effect on me, as it is just like a really bad losing streak happened all at once.
My salary is shit in reality, but I'll tell you the secret to gambling: once you've won, you cannot act like a loser just because you "could have made more".
If I have all my BTC this time next year, congrats to me.
If not, I made $20k and I'm a relatively poor guy so to me that is epic winning.
Yes, I could just make myself rich if I sold everything, but I see a future in crypto and want to own it 25years from now. Also, I recognize my "addiction" and have set myself up so I can feed it safely, and still have won even if everything I have in crypto disappears due to my stupidity.
Yes, I did just admit I am an idiot. 
But I'm also a really good handicapper and I cannot deny that fact.
When you have a 58%+ win rate 2 years going and you taught yourself everything it's hard to tell yourself that you aren't good at it.
I never thought it would be my forte, but I have gotten so good I started my own site and have affiliates, followers, donators and all.
It gives me a sense of success to have built this all on my own, this whole handicapping thing is something I never thought I would become but I like to just roll the dice on life and follow where my strengths lie.
@_date: 2017-12-01 18:34:32
Head! And agreed!
Same here, everything I invested is purely money that I would have legitimately gambled with anyway. So it's really easy for me to just buy and say "okay, let's assume I just put it all on a session of blackjack or something and lost it, just like I would if I made an ATM withdrawal and went to the casino - I can't be upset if I lose it all because this is strictly money that I am willing to expend."
@_date: 2017-12-01 19:56:38
Listen, your stepdad doesn't have ALL the facts - *clearly* - but he IS right about history repeating itself my dude.
Take heed. This is identically similar to EVERY major bubble of the past, and in particular the dotcom bubble.
The thing is that something people did wrong with the dotcom bubble is they SOLD TOO EARLY.
They thought, "we reached the peak surely! time to sell"
And then it doubled in value again before finally popping.
Same thing here, people are hollering "the pop is coming! beware in 2018"
But odds are that history repeats and it double, triples, whatever multiplier you want, and THEN it pops.
Don't sell before you need to! And only invest what you are willing to lose. Always always always. Even with fucking APPLE, or INDEX funds. Do not invest more than you are willing to lose EVER.

@_date: 2017-12-22 17:11:09
Let me lay this out real plain for some people:
I gamble with bitcoin. A LOT.
And I’m talking real gambling
The market swings are extremely reminiscent of gambling swings and it really does prove that bitcoin is a gamble.
But here’s my experience overall...
I won 1.5BTC off .100 in June. Then sold on a “crash”. I made gooooood money still so I didnt think “oh but but I couldve made more!” As that is failed gamblers logic.
I bought in again with half my winnings and won FIVE BTC immediately.
Worked that 5 up to 7, and sold again on a “crash”.
Price breaks ATH two weeks later ad usual and I shake my head.
This repeats MANY times, up until the Bcash “attack” where we dumped from 7.8k to 5.4k.
On the way back up I again thought, “well, this crash is different though, it’s not just a btc dip, its bch gaining traction and btc may very well stay down for good now”
So I sold around 6.4k
BTC proved me wrong yet again, and that time under totally new circumstances.
What has happened is everytime I win BIG, bitcoin takes a shit and makes me want to just collect my earnings while Im still a winner and then look back saying FUCK I COULD BE FILTHY RICH.
Well guess what, not this time.
I turned over another 2BTC of profit this week and the first thing I thought was “I bet bitcoin shits itself now, as this is a trend for me at this point and the world wants to test me but if it does, im not fucking budging.”
And guess what. Im not fucking budging.
Never again will I lose massive amounts of profit due to weak hands.
I had the opportunity and the experience of making the same mistake so very many times when I sold before at 6.4k but I still sold.
NOT this time.
This time, I really bring in the dough. Im ready.
Prove me wrong world. Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice thrice four and five and six times, shame on me.
But try to fool me again after that, and you’ve bevome the fool. 
Good luck suckers. To the moon baby. Im going to break down doors screaming with joy when we hit 100k in a few years.
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:24:45
Not really. If you know how to gamble you could take .250 and make it into a full bitcoin in less than a day lol. Just saying. It's not too far outside of your reach, if you are willing to get extra risky.
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:46:33
LOL. When you gamble with nitro, seeing a price dip is like..."okay? so what, now all the money I just won washes that out." or like, "welp, I just pissed away a good 3BTC of winnings earlier this year, so pretty much nothing is worse than that!"
@_date: 2017-12-01 17:07:22
Lol if you are keeping up with the price pretty much daily, you will be ready when the bubble pops. You might not sell at the top of the pop, but you would be ready enough to sell at a value FAR above your averaged buy-in.
I.e. if you bought in at and average of $2k and it decided to pop right ...NOW.
You would probably not believe it was the pop at first, and maybe hold all the way down to $5k before you were positive it was the end (due to the immediate rate of the drop with no support levels coming in to save the dip at any point on the way down), but you would still end up selling at a value much higher than you bought in and make money, or break even, or maybe lose a little, but I doubt you would hold all the way down to $0...
This gets more and more safe as the price goes up.
So let's say you bought in at $11k the other day, but it doesn't pop until $50k, well you have a full $39k dip to sell your position before it's simply breaking even, and then after that you would lose money but you'd still not lose that much if say you sold just under $10k.
People are stupid. They don't know what a sell order is I guess?
If you are going on vacation and afraid that it might pop while you aren't around to do anything about it, you could have a sell order in at $2-3k below your avg buy-in so you only lost a small amount if it really popped, or you could set it at your avg buy-in so you'd break even.
Again, this get's easier and easier to do the higher the value of bitcoin goes. If it's $50k and your buy in averages out at around $5k then you could keep a sell order for your entire position at $5k, knowing that if it was going to dip $45k all at once that you would definitely be deeming it "the end of bitcoin" and your sell order would go through and break you even in that event.
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:02:55
YUP. This especially easy to justify if you already spend some small or even moderate amounts on lotteries, and other gambling, every year.
If you rack up $500 of gambling wagers each year, completely stop that and invest bit of that $500 up to the full $500 over the course of the year but into BTC instead.
That is a) going to give you good dollar-cost-avg, b) going to ultimately probably be safer than trying to beat the odds of scratchers and casino games, c) almost guaranteed earn you higher gains than you would gambling in other ways.
The only thing I can say is that if you are ADDICTED to gambling, then beware the sites that let you gamble with bitcoin. You can easily and quickly multiply your coin doing that, but if you do that, you are doing the exact same thing as taking that $ to a casino, because it literally is a casino... so just keep that in mind. Gambling with bitcoin defeats the purpose of buying bitcoin and holding it as your actual means of gambling.
If you are decent at actual gambling though, there is no better way to hedge your losses and embellish your gains than to gamble with bitcoin as opposed to fiat (since if you lose say $100 of BTC, but the market rises, you may end up breaking even on $100 loss because the gambling was being done through BTC - and on the other hand you also would earn more than $100 if say you won $100 but again the market rises, that $100 win becomes worth even more).
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:10:39
I never a dip could and you in hot water, I said panic selling, buying at wrong times, etc can land you in hot water. Also, a full on crash would be the worst case scenario, and would be like putting your entire position on BLACK on roulette and it lands RED.
I'm done though. I'll just block. 
If you can't see the insane # of ways that bitcoin investment directly relates to gambling and especially the emotions that gambling creates then you aren't even worth arguing with.
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:51:23
Incorrect. And incorrect.
If you have no trading experience waiting for a dip could land your position in hot water and decrease it gradually over time so you actually lose money.
Also, if it isn't gambling then why does everyone smart and level-headed in crpyto, even the biggest names - all agree that you should only invest disposable income that you are willing to lose 100% of it.
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:42:15
You are inferring that if at a certain point there wasn't enough existing fiat to pay off gains being made that the exchanges would suddenly say: "you can't buy anymore, because if the entire market of all cryptos sold right now all at once, we wouldn't have enough fiat to pay it all off". *Edit: what I mean is that you are inferring that places like gdax have TRILLIONS of dollars in fiat on hand to pay back everyone all at once if they all sold *everything* right now in this moment, and that just isnt true. Gdax would be in massive debt and TONS of fiat would need to be printed for them to pay it off. It would completely inflate all fiat. Gdax and other exchanges only have as much fiat to their name as people put in to begin with, plus a surplus to pay back, but I can guarantee they don't have a big enough surplus to pay back EVERYONE selling at once lmfao.
That's just not true. The market will grow as it grows, the only reason it isn't printing or causing tons of printing right now is because people still are holding their increased value in cryptos. What I am saying is that technically if every coin existing died all at once because the entirety of everyone in crypto sold all their positions simultaneously, that the amount owed would far exceed the amount of fiat that was put into the markets in the first place and easily exceeds what they could pay everyone back, which means money would need to be printed to pay off those debts and give people the money they earned from selling. Thus causing a massive inflation of fiats all at once and completely devaluing them as well.
If it was executed right, the crypto world could completely devalue not only every crypto existing but also all fiats too, leaving every world currency extremely inflated.

Coinbase Pro would be  I don’t deal with them, but it is a major and very legit exchange and if you are dealing directly on the exchange you don’t pay fees to buy and sell if you set limit orders and you dont pay tx fees to move it off into a private wallet (unless the old GDAX - now Coinbase Pro- ways have changed...). So really the only fee you should ever pay is the bitcoin tx mining fee to move it off your private wallet back onto the exchange before selling it. And I suppose also the tx fees for moving it around outside your private wallet, whether it be to goto another wallet somewhere or to make a payment or whatever.

Dude, 100% agree, this is the most fun I've had gambling in all of my years.
A river card winner on a $10,000 poker hand wouldn't even give me this much excitement.
It's a constant stream of excitement, and I don't have to invest more than once if I don't want to.
It's like I put $1000 on the table, and then never added to my bankroll, and just watched the cards play out day by day by day rooting for my bankroll to keep increasing, watching it dip sometimes, but never really caring, and never having to lose more than my initial investment.
It's safer than gambling because you can't lose all your money at once in a heartbeat unless BTC popped and hit a flat $0, which is incredibly unlikely at this point. And even if it did, it would've been a LONG fun ride by that point, and way more entertaining than losing the same amount of money in 1 hr of unlucky gambling at a casino.

bitcoin isn't going to die SOON.
THat's one thing we know for sure.
BoA just got a patent for their own crypto exchange system. Futures are now becoming available starting next week.
You really think cryptos are going to fade out within 1-3years? That's just not logical thinking man.
I have "gotten out" plenty of times, but learned my lesson which is that this isn't going anywhere for a while. Maybe starting 2020 it will fizzle and become a part of history everyone can learn what not to do from, but until then I'm in it to win it.

I'm surprised it's surviving above* $1000. It seems like that is only because people are literally holding on for dear life.
As soon as they experience some volatility like BTC, and weak hands sell, it will have a LOT of trouble recovering to break new highs like BTC *ALWAYS* does.
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:14:07
It's about to hit below $16k any minute here. Now is your chance.
I would advise buying back at $15k if it goes that low, as we should see another rally when the BCH dust settles.
Same shit as before when 2x cancelled the fork and BCH came in hot wanting to swoop up the newcomers that suddenly decided BTC was a bad idea since they werent going to get their free duped coins.
All the hype went over to BCH. BCH rose a good 50%. BTC dipped a good 20%+.
Two weeks later? We broke 10k for the first time.
That's the nature of these situations. Do not fear BCH.
Everytime BTC is "attacked", it proves its resilience and thus shows the market that it is worth getting back into, and then you see the recovery surge.
I highly advise you listen to Andreas A. and his talks on bitcoin "attacks".
BCH is a new player in the game with how much traction it just gained.
They are now vulnerable to the same attacks as well and those will be more prominent now that it is more popular.
Let them have their glory. After all, the idea behind the fork is smart, but the people backing it are the only issue. They have some sort of agenda for a global currency takeover by 2020 it seems.
As if 1% of the population owning crpyto and fiat having not even seen a lick of devaluation from crypto growth yet is going to give them the opportunity to become the go-to payment choice for 50%+ of the global population, thus giving it mass adoption status.
Again, the BCH idea is fine, it's just the people behind it stuck in a confirmation bias derived by their own community network are too daft to see that this movement is something that could take decades or centuries to achieve. Fiat isn't dead. It will not be dead any time soon. Just stick around for the REAL growth as both BTC and BCH rise up and devalue fiat over the next few decades.

CBOE doesnt deal in crypto. It's a 100% fiat system for the btc futures. Has no affect on the market...*directly*
The reason for the stability more lies in the fact that having a future placed on BTC provides an incentive to get into the asset itself in order to hedge your future if it is on BTC dropping.
Couple that with the fact that large spikes upward or downward temporarily pause futures at CBOE and you get a sort of effect where the price generally will go up a bit more with extra people buying in to hedge, but also they have good incentive to sell sell sell if it's going to hurt their futures contract and make them lose on it.
This is over time going to still create growth, but at a more stable rate, with less big day to day volatility and price spiking.
Also, yes, BTC saw its big jump, correction, and slight recovery - meanwhile altcoins were only dropping during that hype (a lot of people were moving *from* alts to BTC to get even more gains), and when the market settled, the logical move was to jump onto/back-to the alts before they took their own price leap (which mind you they will also be met with healthy correction and recovery).
As soon as the alts settle now, more people will again shift back to BTC and there will still be some noticeable volatility, but again - over time it will reduce as more futures exchanges open for BTC and more large players get into those futures and also invest int he asset itself to attempt to manipulate a bit and hedge their futures. I know I didn't mention those with futures for BTC to rise, but in that case, they would buy *later* (instead of beforehand) in an attempt to avoid losing on their futures if the price is going down too much, which again - stabilizes things overall. 
Essentially, in regards to futures, the more players there that are hedging with the asset itself -the less volatile the ups and downs become for BTC. It will ultimately keep growing but I say this is good for it as it will eventually need to slow growth and become very very stable for it to be considered a completely safe store of value and/or payment method.

All I know is best way to ensure your coins do get duped is to hold privately.
Anywhere they are being held they will create the forked coins, but if that happens on an exchange wallet that never ends up supporting the fork, you can never get the forked coins.
If it happens and your holding privately, then you just need to figure out with whoever the devs are for the private wallet what they are doing in regards to getting people their forked coins since private wallets pretty much always support the forks, it's just it takes time for them to code things so they can get something up so everyone can retrieve their forked coins.

OP, as someone in literally the EXACT same situation, but with only 30k left in loans (so similar that even I too sold at 5800 to make a dent and semi-regret it, but dont really because fuck debt), I implore you to keep paying the extra $350.
I do the same thing. I got back into BTC, am making gains again, and have $30k loans and pay an extra $300-400 a month on top of the regular payments (which mind you I dont not have in IDR because again - fuck debt, I want it gone).
I recognize that every $350 could be better spent on bitcoin, but at the same time, it allows me to keep paying my loans WITHOUT HAVING TO LIQUIDATE MY BTC POSITION.
If BTC really takes off and you have enough to sell with leftover and straight clear your debt, then do it, otherwise keep on the path you are on.
Crazy how similar our situation is, all the way down to when we sold, the reason, and how much extra we pitch towards loans monthly.
If you are really that concerned, my other recommendation would be this:
Take $50 of the $350/mo, and load it onto gdax USD wallet. Let it take it's time to get there and what not, so that you pay 0 fees on getting it there, and then can buy any coin at any time with no fees by setting a limit order for your buy.
If 6 months goes by, you will have $300 in your USD wallet on the exchange (not a scary amount to keep on the exchange at all tbh...) and then you can use it in bulk to buy. OR you could dollar cost avg by buying at what you think the low is each following month after you send the $50 and it arrives however many days later.

LTC bar-none.
It's everything Btrash strives to be really.
They want to overthrow BTC and be the real bitcoin, because they have bigger blocks and low tx fees, but LTC is already crazy fast with insanely low tx fees. There isn't a need for BCH, LTC already fulfills it and can be reworked for bigger blocks if ever needed.

It's not zero-sum is what I am saying. 
You put in $1000 @ $1000/BTC, another person puts in $10000 @ $1000/BTC. 
That's 11BTC existing right now, but the price is now greater than $1000/BTC because of speculation in the market, it is say, $1050/BTC, which means if all 11BTC existing were sold, the exchange would have $11000 on hand to pay back fromw hat consumers invested, but would owe $11550. 
Where does the extra $550 come from? They have to foot the bill. Just like if you go pay a casino $200 but walk out with $750. Now think of that on a massive scale where they owe WAY more money. 
You really think the exchanges had TRILLIONS of dollars ready to pay since day 1 of this, in the event of a massive and complete sell off of everything once the price got this high, or even that they have that amount to pay back now?
Edit: this is obviously very simplified and I know if the person holding his 10BTC sold first, the person holding 1BTC would probably not get to sell at $1050 as well, but my point still stands.

RIGHT! It's the only thing I am unsure about!
Like I know that selling multiple times is no different than selling once if the end gains are the same (i.e. if you sell 5x and gain $1000 each time, or sell once and gain $5000, you will pay the same overall in taxes because say 15% of $1000 5x over, is the same as 15% of $5000 once) but I am unsure about what happens if you take one big loss and it evens you out.
Do you need to file a LOSS on the one big loss, and file gains on all the sells that made gains, and possibly not break even because you don't get as much back from the loss you reported as you get taken out for the gains you made. Hows it work in that situatioN!

Twisting words again. I said that if it CRASHED to $0 it would've been like putting your entire investment on black.
In the mean time, it's just a safer way of gambling because odds are you wwould only lose a % of your investment instead of the entire "bet".

No I was talking about using actual bitcoin gambling sites. 
Like placing bitcoin bets on sports games, etc. which I do do myself.
Also, I gamble by day trading with my LTC.
Over the weekend I turned 2.46 LTC into 4.25. Now it's going to break $200 and I'm over here like aw shitttt, good thing my last limit order was a buy, and not a sell or I'd be kicking myself and probably have to buy back in and be kicked down to like 3-3.5 LTC.

No sweat dude. You know, if you think this thing is gonna stick around for 5 years, and you start investing $25-100 at a time whenever you have DISPOSABLE income, you could easily end up with 1BTC in the long term.
Think bigger, don't shrink yourself down to the now all the time. It's good to live in the present, but better to accept the present and plan for the future. Whatever you do though, say FUCK you to the past. It has no bearing on who you are today or tomorrow. That's the beauty of human life. You could be a cubical worker today with a bad attitude, and the very next day you can wake up and just act like you are a golden god of office workers and nothing can stop you. You chose your path mate. If you want 1BTC, I guarantee you'll find a smart sensible way to make your way there.

Who fucking cares? You WON. Don't you realize you WON.

If you are that worried then you can hold on an exchange like GDAX and put in a sell order.
You can put your sell order for any amount, whether it be above the current market price, what you bought in for, slightly under what you bought in for, slightly over what you bought in for.
And if it suddenly collapsed out of no where, your sell order would still go through even if the system was backlogged. You would have your sell order go through and the exchange would owe you however much BTC was on the sell order at the exchange rate identified on the sell order.
So if you had 1 BTC and you had a sell order at $5k, it would go through and GDAX would owe you $5k, even if they couldnt get you the $5k right away, the order would've gone through and you would be locked in at that amount and it would be owed to you legally.

I started Gemini. Pretty easy to use. Incredibly fast verification even though it said they are backed up and it could take a while. Not the case, it took under 24hrs.
Then I linked my bank and made a deposit. The deposit cleared after 4-5 days which is exactly how long they noted it would take usually. 
In the meantime, I was still able to purchase BTC. Just had to wait until the deposit fully cleared to be able to withdraw that BTC.
Also, between Authy app and the double checks on devices (have to answer an email else a new device will be blacklisted from any withdrawing for the first 24hrs), it turns out to be very secure overall. 
0 fees to deposit, 0 fees to buy my BTC, and 0 fees to withdraw it to my private wallet.
Also, been a long time since I moved BTC. From private wallet to another address I wanted to send it too, my fee was only .00001 (this is outside of Gemini mind you, but I was very pleasantly surprised with the super low fee and my transaction confirming within 5mins still - much better than end of 2017 with the ridiculous fees and everything so backed up!).

Hey can anyone lead me to the download history on Gdax as well?
I have done plenty of tx's through both. On GDAX at some point I did a LOT of day trading with LTC in particular. Lots of buys/sells at +$1-10 from current price and then buy back at -$1-10 to increase my position.
I plan on taking all my history to a broker to just get it sorted out instead of trying to use the internet since no one at all can seem to agree on how anything is taxed.
If a professional can't figure it out, I can get my money back that I pay them. If the internet can't help and I try myself and do it wrong though, then I am the one who is negligent and I don't feel like being penalized for that.

Right. Wtf is everyone on about, we are up 60% from 30days ago.
How is that bad?????? This is amazing for crypto.
Nothing could be healthier.
If we broke $20k without a gigantic correction (yes I know we hit 13-14k already from 19k but it was TOO BRIEF) then I would legitimately fear a bubble.
This complete wipes all my concerns of a bubble.
That seems counterintuitive on the surface but just think for half a second and you might understand that this is nothing short of the best thing that couldve happened for bitcoin in 2017.
This makes 2018 100x more promising.
2018 was going to be an edge of your seat year just wondering when it would all end.
Now we are poised instead for another 1000% gain over 2018. 
Bitcoin could very well bust 100k next year and god forbid we all have to endure some turmoil before that occurs.

I didn't mention that but yes you are absolutely right.
This is so similar to the dotcom bubble that it's almost safe to say if you can just forget you have the money invested, you could hold right through the pop and reap the benefits of a price 10-20x where it popped from many years down the road.
The ultimate best move, which would be oh so difficult to execute would be to sell within 10% of where it pops at, and then buy back int he days after the pop and just hodl again for years until it fully recovered and blew up beyond where it had popped, just like Apple and Amazon.

Yah dude, all good!
I quickly realized that as far as just holding your coin you should do almost everything through GDAX.
Like I said, the only time CoinBase really comes into play is when you want to make an *immediate* "deposit" of BTC into your coinbase or gdax (i.e. when you want to BUY btc but you want it locked in at the price you are currently seeing).
Even if you lock it in and it takes 4 days for the coin to arrive in your wallet, it's worth paying the CoinBase fees to get the price you were seeing and wanting at that very moment since that's how non-instant btc buys work through CoinBase.
Everything else though, do it through GDAX. 
Moving between cryptos? No Fees.
Exchanging for fiat? No fees.
Moving to private wallet? No fees.
Moving fiat to bank? No fees.
No fees ever! Well, fees, but GDAX pays them all so you pay nothing.
For the longest time I would, buy with CoinBase, pay a fee for that, then move to a private wallet and pay a fee for that.
Then move back to CoinBase (and pay a fee, but those ones are expected because moving coin from your private wallet will always cost fees), then sell some, and pay a fee to have the fiat sent to my bank.
Fees everywhere!
Quickly learned about GDAX and got away from all that.
Now I only pay when I want a price locked in in that very moment since on GDAX you can't make instant buys without fiat already loaded and to load fiat it takes a few days for the ACH to go through so by the time you have the fiat the price you wanted is long gone (rarely does it turn out that the price is lower than you were trying to buy at - unless you're making really bad buys lol)
@_date: 2017-12-01 17:17:24
GUYS. Get yourself on GDAX...
CoinBase charges regular tx fees just to xfer your coin off to a private wallet.
GDAX will let you xfer your coin to that platform from CoinBase for free (they cover the tx fees) and they will let you xfer it OFF Gdax to your private wallet free too (again, they cover those tx fees too).
They also cover tx fees for selling part or all of your position for USD (or other fiat) and cover the fees for xferring it to your bank account.
CoinBase will charge you fees for everyone one of those things, really racking up the costs and how much gains you need to make to make it worth moving coin around or selling it and moving fiat to your bank.
CoinBase is only necessary when you want to make an instant/ACH BTC purchase using your debit or bank routing.
I.e. like the other day, I wanted to BUY at the very moment it hit $9k, and the only way to do and get it at that very moment for that price was to buy through CoinBase.
If you have time you can load up some USD on GDAX with an ACH xfer, but that takes a few days to have the fiat ready ont he market to make an instant purchase.
Literally everything but immediate and instant buys trying to lock in a dip price for a buy can be done through Gdax free of charge.
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:12:16
You know, if everyone that is making gains on BTC sold their position, it would be like a massive sudden printing of fiat.
I.e., if the entire world was dealing in say USD (for simplicity) and again for simplicity we all had bought simultaneously $1000 of BTC at $1000/BTC, and can cash out today for (again, simplicity) $10000.
Every single person would have made a cool $9000.
Multiply that by as many people that cashed out, and we would've essentially PRINTED $9000(x) of USD, all at once.
Just saying... BTC rising like this and people selling and making gains so often is basically the world printing their own money right now because of how large the gains are. 
It's not like someone holding onto APL stock for 5 years and selling to make $5000 of their shares.
We're talking people are making that $5000 over night and selling to get it in fiat, i.e. they just printed $5000, and the banks have to honor it.
That means that indeed if we all sold at once after a big price hike, we would completely inflate the world's fiat currencies all at once.
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:52:53
The buyer is the exchange. The exchange only has as much money as was put into the market by the consumers. If they all sold simultaneously on an inflated market price, the exchanges wouldn't have enough to pay everyone back the surplus they are owed, as they would only have the amount of money that got invested by the consumers in the first place.
It's not zero-sum is what I am saying. You put in $1000 @ $1000/BTC, another person puts in $10000 @ $1000/BTC. That's 11BTC existing right now, but the price is now greater than $1000/BTC, it is say, $1050/BTC, which means if all 11BTC were sold, the exchange would have $11000 on hand to pay back, but would owe  $11550. Where does the extra $550 come from? They have to foot the bill. You really think the exchanges had TRILLIONS of dollars ready to pay back to people the gains they are owed in the event of a massive and complete sell off of everything, or even that they have that amount to pay back now?
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:17:43
Here's my question: if you only declare capital gains, but say you sold many many many times, and each time you made capital gains, but ONE time you took a big loss and so overall you say invested $10000 and ended up having $10000 in your bank againa fter selling your entire position...does that mean you owe nothing? Or do you still owe for each of the times you sold throughout the time you were holding and made capital gains (i.e. if you bought once for $1000 and sold that same $1000 of BTC later for $2000, and then again did that same thing a month later, and 4 more times...do you owe taxes on $1000x6=$6000, even if you made 1 $16000 buy at the end and sold that one for $10000, meaning you lost $6000 and broke even OVERALL).

Glad I could help. I think it's important if you are looking between both subs that you understand that a lot of the argument seems to be centered around what chain is better as far as the vision of bitcoin, but that's not really what is motivating the market.
The talk is about that, but the trading/purchasing? It's all about the money man. How can anyone ignore the money that is flowing through these markets.
I think it was Warren Buffet or someone of similar kind that said something like "even if you don't believe bitcoin will survive, you cannot deny that there is real money flowing there".
@_date: 2017-11-13 21:03:47
= supports BTC
= supports BCH
BCH stemmed from BTC, and wants to eventually be BTC, and have BTC be BTC Legacy (or Core). 
BCH *seemingly* headed, operated and funded by shady characters.
BTC thinks they are more wholesome.
Both types have HODLers and traders. 
Both sides have “all my eggs are in one basket type people”
Both sides want to have their coin be the most valuable.
BTC thinks BCH is being manipulated and is a scam.
BCH thinks BTC is just afraid because they have a more outlined vision and tech that can achieve that.
- bottom line: no one is understanding that the large majority are 100% concerned about their money, yes, their fiat money invested in these coins and how much fiat they can get out at anytime- and they are 0% concerned about what coin is better for the vision. But that is how each coin demonstrates its future value to the public so they must focus on talking about that so the value keeps rising so people stay with their coin. All anybody truly wants in this moment and for at least a few years to come is to make as much potential fiat as possible (i.e. if they were to sell their entire position at once they would get the most gains).

We all get what it’s supposed to be in the future ans what BCH is supposed to be in the future (and maybe even why it’s better for that purpose) but the bottomline is that the amount of MONEY flowing through these markets is very very real. So there is only one goal right now: make money off of it all. There’s 3 ways to do that: gamble by day-trading, actually gambling, or gamble by hodling and speculating about the near future price.

Can easily dip down to $8k within the next 24hrs, but that would just entice me to buy even more. Not scared at all by this.

If the ATH is set around $11,300 right now then we are talking $12k+ within a couple weeks even if it drops to $7.5k in between that time.

C) Coinbase will see you passed coin to a private wallet, and they cant track it from there. When you send back coin from gambling, go through the wallet again, and for all they know, you just sent back coin from the same place you sent to to begin with and it doesnt violate their terms. They can't track your private wallet so they have NO idea if you sending back MORE coin than you sent out was because you gambled or because you got paid in BTC, or bought on a different exchange and sent to that same wallet, etc.

You act like this guy has unlimited BTC...
He has a finite amount just like everyone else, and it's pretty safe to assume that it was all purchased at less than the current going rate of ~$4000/BTC.
If he pays rent in BTC until all of his investment is gone, it seems like he wins out because he maybe only paid say $6000, for all his BTC currently, but can cover say $12000 of rent for the year witht hat $6000. SO it seems great because he saves $6000, but in the long run, he loses money as that BTC gains value drastically and he no longer owns it. He can only get abck in the market by buying more at a much higher price than he entered the market at.
Why not let the landlord enter the market at the higher prices? Why let go of your capital gains now for a discount on rent, when those gains could be multiplied 100x over if you just held them for the future.

Yes, he would be fucked over. Rationally speaking, he is losing money by converting to BTC before paying the $1000 because he is AWARE of the EV of BTC in the future. Being aware of the EV makes it real. You can't deny in your head that BTC is worth more than what you are purchasing it for in that moment. You can't pretend just because in the moment it's only $1000 that it isn't later worth more. That's irrational.

I think the big thing you're missing here is that the lost value in holding the coin is a perfect case of an "opportunity cost" and rational consumers make all their actions with opportunity costs being factored in.
Also, it isn't necessarily zero-sum on every path, the way the game is setup, but on the paths that do end in zero-sum payoffs the rational econ doesn't care that by him/her losing that his "opponent" is thus gaining. The players only care what their own payoffs are, and that if they are losing, they pick the path that loses them the *least* (opportunity costs included).
The rational econ decides only based on his/her own most optimal path in whatever the "game" may be.
By this I just mean that, in the way you write out the game tree, if you are making two paths for the tenant - say, "Pays in USD (12mo)" and "Pays in BTC (12mo)", you are making a game tree where only the tenant PLAYS, but the tenant and the landlord are both "players".
The unfortunate part about all this is that these models have to be dumbed down a *ton*, and so to your request at a hypothetical for a .01% discount - my response is just that that would require the game to be rewritten and expanded outside of the simplicity we are dealing with here - so I can do that, but I would have to think it through and make sure I didn't set up the game wrong since more comes into play and extra paths appear because more contingencies exist.
Anyway, so since these models are very simple, we are assuming actually that the tenant is paying rent in full for the year all at once in the beginning, which just makes it easier to understand but doesn't really alter the outcome. *Also note:* we are assuming the tenant - in the case they pay in BTC - could have paid the total in USD while simultaneously having bought that much in BTC and held it through the 12mo.
So when you write the "payoffs", say for the path "Pays in USD for 12mo", you would write -12000 and 12000, indicating that the tenant can expect -12000 as his payoff after Paying in USD for 12mo, and the landlord can expect 12000 as his payoff.
On the "Pays for 12mo in BTC" side of the tree, you have a fork in the path where you could put something like 1/4 and 3/4 probabilities (and this is being generous assuming that bitcoin COULD actually have a chance to lose value in that 12mo), 1/4 chance being that BTC lowers 25% in value over 12mo such that the payoffs become -12000 still for the tenant (since even though BTC lowered in price, he paid $12000 for it, and cannot realize a potential "savings" of $3000 just because he didn't hold the coin and lose $3000) and +9000 for the landlord since he received $12000 all at once in the form of bitcoin and 12mo later it's only worth $9000. (Notice how this path is NOT zero-sum, i.e. -12000 + 9000 = -3000).
On the 3/4 probability of the fork in the path you could make that something like 3/4 chance of BTC increasing say, 75% in value over 12mo, such that the payoffs for that path become -21000 for the tenant who paid $12000 but "lost" an additional $9000 in opportunity costs because holding for 12 months after buying $12000 of coin would have increased that $12000 value to $21000. The payoff for the landlord thus becomes +21000. For the fork as a total, the expected value between both outcomes at those probabilities for the player (the tenant) is -18750 (.25x-12000 + .75x-21000 = -18750).
Thus you have a tree where path 1 (pays in USD for 12mo) offers a EV of -12000, and path 2 (pays in USD for 12mo) offers a EV of -18750, thus the player - the tenant - would opt for the path of "pays in USD" every time since -12000 always beats -18750.
You may imagine this model and think, "well, wait a second, for the 1/4 probability that BTC decreases 25% in value over 12mo, he said that the tenant would still get a payoff of -12000 because he paid that regardless, and it's the landlord's payoff there that is altered to 9000 instead. BUT, what about on the 3/4 side? He could say there too that the tenant still paid $12000, so why does it get to be called -21000 there but not -9000 on the 1/4 side?"
That's simply because we've assumed the tenant paid in full for 12mo initially and if the tenant held that coin for 12mo instead, he would've had $21000 after. There is an *opportunity cost* there of an extra $9000. On the other hand, if the tenant held the coin and it lost 25% value, he would have $9000 after 12mo, but still would have paid the landlord $12000 in full initially, so his loss is -12000 (as opposed to -9000 because you can't assume he "saved" $3000 by not holding the coin, and say -12000 + 3000 = -9000, because actually he "saved" $3000 on having to pay $15000, since it would cost him $15000 had he held $12000 in coin for 12mo and also paid $12000 in USD instead - remember: we are assuming the tenant - in the case they pay in BTC - could have paid the total in USD while simultaneously having bought that much in BTC and held it through the 12mo...if you want to factor this in fully then you would actually put the payoff for the tenant on this path at -15000, but that only makes an even STRONGER case for this whole thing, so feel free to do so).
Basically, assuming the tenant is fully rational, they would not fall victim to the "opportunity cost" of holding their coin and making an extra $9000. It's almost like the antithesis of the sunk cost fallacy. In this case though, the person would be writing off an "unrealized gain" as a non-loss. That would be irrational in economic terms though, to write off an opportunity cost and not factor it in completely.
*Here is an example of the sunk cost fallacy I found as it applies to stocks/investments:*
"Jennifer buys $1,000 worth of Company X’s stock in January. In December, its value has dropped to $100 even though the overall market and similar stocks have risen in value over the year. Instead of selling the stock and putting that $100 into a different stock that is likely to rise in value, she holds on to Company X’s stock, which in the coming months becomes worthless."
The antithesis is also an irrational decision which would be something more like:
"Jennifer buys $12000 worth of BTC in January and sells it immediately to her landlord. In December, the value has increased to $21000, but instead of buying $12000 in BTC again in the coming January and holding it and paying $12000 in USD in rent too, she buys $12000 in BTC again and sells it just the same as before in order to pay her rent."
It's a fallacy and an irrational move because the tenant would never do that knowing the opportunity cost incurred. Rational consumers always fully factor in any opportunity costs, and the potential future value of BTC is a glaring "opportunity" and so, cannot be ignored.
Anyway, hope that all makes sense, but what you end up with is a decision between -12000 or -18750 in EV for the ways to pay rent.
Now, you can see too though that depending on how this person speculates the future of the BTC market will be, they could potentially find it better to pay in BTC. But so long as we assume the tenant would be a bitcoin "enthusiast", we can safely assume they would have expectations of the future value of BTC being anything over 0% more than it's current price. It's only once the tenant speculates that the probability path (at ANY probability) where BTC raises in value is actually a 0% gain in value, that the tenant would be indifferent between paying in USD or paying in BTC. As long as the tenant speculates, even with a .000001% probability, that the path where BTC rose in value over 12mo was anything over 0% increase in value, then the tenant will always pay in USD, since even at the smallest amounts (say, 1% probability BTC rises 0.1% in 12 months) the payoffs would be -12000 for paying in USD, or -12001 EV in paying in BTC given the probability paths. -12000 is still better than -12001. Rational econs are only indifferent at exactly equal values.

What??? You are stupid.
If you buy the dip at $4500, and it goes to $10,000, you still did better than if you bought at $5k.
If you buy the dip again at $3k, and it goes to $10k, you made good on your $3k buy AND your $4.5k buy, both better than if you had bought high at $5k.
Honestly, you don't understand shit.
If you expect BTC to go anywhere ABOVE the previous "high" then buying ANYTHING below that high is more profitable than having bought at the high itself.
I.e. if you buy the dip "wrong" are you really doing it wrong? Or do you just make an extra $500 on every BTC instead of an extra $1000?.
Point is, you still made more than you would had you bought high.
Once the dip starts, if you are certian it will break the previous high, ANY buy below that is a good buy of the dip. Some buys are better yes, but they are not WRONG as long as the price goes back PAST that buy value, you bought the dip right. Period.

Your landlord wants you to pay him in BTC cuz he knows the value of HODLing for 5-10years. You pay your rent in BTC and then think about later how your $10000 of rent a year actually cost you 5x-10x that amount because you paid in BTC and it went up so high.
If you take him up on that you are getting scammed. Don't be an idiot.
**Edit** I cannot explain it any simpler than this:
**Simple game theory. If the EXPECTED VALUE (EV) is greater than $1000, and the EV of the fiat is less than $1000, then paying with the currency that has less EV is better.
Even if the CURRENT value is inherently the same, no rational "econ" would ever convert to a currency that has a higher EV just to make a payment with it immediately.
If those are the only two contingent actions - pay $1000 of BTC, or $1000 of USD - then in a rational model, the consumer would ALWAYS pay in the USD, and that is BECAUSE of the known EV of both currencies.
Even if the EV wasn't known for the BTC, and there was a speculated *probability* of the BTC having a higher EV, then you could still run the model and actually find out exactly how UNSURE the econ has to be in order to pay rent in BTC instead. I.e. if the consumer in the model thought there was only a 40% chance that the BTC would have a higher EV then depending on how high that EV was, then they might still pay in fiat, and vice versa - if they believed also there was a 60% chance that the EV was less, then depending on the EV, they might actually pay in BTC instead.**
@_date: 2017-09-19 16:35:23
I just mean in a theoretical model, you would actually assume the consumer is so rational that they are aware of the EV the moment they purchase the coin and no sooner or later. When they say "rational" in these models, they really take it to the limit lol.
@_date: 2017-09-18 19:45:15
Well, apologies.
Also, I know that it seems like I'm trying to battle you here, but I hope you have caught the number of times I have conceded to your position. 
I just think it's very important for people to understand that if you are aware of the EV of BTC being greater in the future, then you can't place the EV on it currently at $1000. The math doesn't work like that.  You are aware, therefore you must rationally conclude that paying in BTC is the equivalent of paying more than $1000 in that moment. It's your knowledge of BTC, what it is, and what it's worth and will be worth that makes this irrational to ignore.
We both agree, when it comes down to it $1000 is $1000, but we also both agree that $1000 BTC now is worth more than $1000 in the future. So if there is NO difference in paying $1000 now in BTC as opposed to $1000 in fiat, then the only slight difference is that you know that the BTC will be worth more in the future, but unless you are trying to BENEFIT the landlord (which why would you be?) then why would you make the conversion for him, efficiency-wise, that's just one extra step you took to pay rent, so even if you didn't see the EV of the BTC as higher, you can still say that that 1 minute or whatever of your time could've been saved by paying in fiat instead. Which again, in a wholly rational model, the "econ" would take the most efficient path, even if it was just to save a single minute.
But if barring any other differences if the only difference that can be seen is that you could consider the EV of $1000 BTC to be greater than that of the $1000 fiat, then you would be silly to make that conversion when you could otherwise do LESS "work" (spend less time) and pay $1000 in fiat instead. If the only difference is the EV of the currencies than it makes no sense to ever pay in BTC until the EV of the BTC becomes less than that of the amount due for rent.

There is a loss, in a rational economic model, the consumer is aware of the greater Expected Value of the BTC compared to the USD, and as such they cannot rationally pay with the BTC without factoring it in as a loss. Therefore, they would never pay in BTC in the first place, because that would be irrational and in a working economic model, all consumers are wholly rational.
I'm just trying to put it into an academic perspective for you, because I can guarantee you if you took this question to say an Econ Professor at Harvard, they would go through a ton of game theory and probability and shit and would eventually prove to you that this consumer doesn't not exist in a rational model because their actions would be deemed wholly irrational, they would prove the consumer would always pay in fiat.
I'm not going to write up a whole working model on this for you, I'm only trying to give you the very bare bones basics so you can understand that although there is "no gain or loss", in a model that covers 100% of contingencies in this situation, the consumer would never pay in BTC given current knowledge of fiat versus BTC.
Does the real world work like a model? No.
That's why you can definitely say that paying in BTC is an effort to adopt the currency over time and helps the future of the crypto, but that's when real life differs from models/theories, is when the consumer takes on a stance or thought process that can't be calculated. In your case, the consumer wants to help expedite the adoption of BTC as a day-to-day currency. That's a semi-emotionally based action and thus a model wouldn't be able to represent it.
I'm just telling you what a RATIONAL "econ" would do. A consumer that is wholly rational and that lives within economic theory would never pay their rent in BTC in 2017. Period.
You cannot deny that fact. I get where you are coming from dude, I really do, and I agree that paying for things now helps adopt it into reality, etc. And I also agree that $1000 is $1000 any way you cut it, but I am trying to show you how someone who was trying to do academic research on whether consumers in 2017 should pay rent in BTC or not would come to the conclusion that no rational consumer in 2017 would ever do that.

Oh okay, so paying $1000/mo in rent in BTC which will raise drastically in value over many years is better than paying $1000/mo in rent with USD which will lose value over time due to inflation.
Makes sense.
You go ask your landlord if you can pay in BTC too then. Hell, I'll buy your building out if you gonna pay me rent in BTC.
Every year you live there for $12000/yr (assuming $1000/mo rent) you will pay me in BTC instead and in the end I will look back and say "wow he lived there for 3 years and paid me $36000 in BTC but that's worht $100000 now, looks like I made $64000 more than I shouldve." Whos the idiot in that situation? Cmon, tell me. The landlord making over double what he shouldve made or the tenant who paid more than double what he shouldve paid because he wanted to do transactions with his fancy digital wallet.
@_date: 2017-09-18 18:13:01
Saying he should pay his rent in BTC, is like saying "you have 10BTC to your name, it's a GOOD idea to sell it off $1000 at a time once each month until you have no BTC left."
That is literally what paying your rent monthly in BTC would mean.
It would be the equivalent of selling off $1000/mo until it was depleted and you were no longer an investor in the market. You would be at the mercy of new market pricing if you wanted to rejoin and reinvest at that point.
I can't imagine anyone here who thinks BTC will ever break $10000 (and let's be honest, I think EVERYONE expects that in the somewhat relative future) I can't imagine anyone who thinks that, also thinking that selling their investment off bit by bit consistently each month is somehow a good idea.
The only way it is a good idea is if you planned on cashing in on your capital gains anyway right now and exiting the market entirely; otherwise, it's idiotic - it goes againt everything you bought the coin for in the first place. If you just wanted short term capital gains then sure, go for it, but if you hold a certain amount of coin and sell it off monthly that's a clear move to exit the market since your coin is FINITE.
Unless you are exiting the market altogether and never plan to invest again, selling your BTC off monthly is stupid.

I'm giving you the answer in terms of what an fully rational economic model would conclude, which is that the consumer (in 2017) should and would never pay rent in BTC.
Yes, the most basic game theory models are zero-sum games, and reality is not a zero-sum game - but it doesn't detract from what the model would show if you put it together, which is that no rational consumer would pay rent in BTC in 2017.
If you want to call rational models useless for learning, then go talk to every college/university ever, because they all start with rational models. There is inherent value in understanding the basics of how rational consumers act.
**Does it apply directly to real life? Pretty much never**, but it still allows us to determine what a wholly rational consumer would do in any given situation, and from that we can deduce why certain deviations from the rational path are made, whereas if we couldn't say what the wholly rational consumer would do, then those deviations would only be able to be speculated upon as opposed to being answered with strong conviction given outside variables that couldn't be factored into the rational model to begin with.
I dunno what else to say besides that YOU ARE RIGHT, but you are also wrong in terms of what is wholly rational.
@_date: 2017-09-18 18:22:47
Why would you go and buy $1000 worth of something that you know will be worth $2000 soon and pay for something that only costs $1000 with it? That's so stupid. You know it's gonna be worth more soon so you give it away? If you bought $1000 in BTC to pay rent, then why not just hold the $1000, make the capital gains as the market grows and just pay your rent in USD - a fiat currency that loses value over time.
Why not just pay $1000 in fiat? You are inherently fucking yourself if you are buying BTC to give it away.
BTC is in a state of growth. Using it as a currency right now is literally the worst thing you could do.
@_date: 2017-09-18 19:51:14
Right I agree, it's for the $1000 which he will NOT keep, but I guess my main main main point here is that once the ACTION of converting the fiat to BTC occurs, the rational consumer cannot deny the greater EV of the BTC compared to the $1000 in fiat. You can't, you have to accept that despite it being $1000 that you won't keep, it is still expected to be worth more now that you have purchased it.
That's all. All I am saying, is, it does YOU as the consumer 0 benefit to convert the fiat before paying it out. And if you are 100% indifferent about whether you pay in BTC versus Fiat, then you should always pay in fiat, because it's that much less time it takes you to pay the rent, and it also avoids the sudden increase in EV of your $ immediately after it becomes converted into BTC.

cuz i love stirring the pot
@_date: 2017-09-18 18:43:40
You lose out by paying in BTC because in economic theory once you BUY the BTC, it has a FUTURE VALUE assigned to it.
Once you buy the BTC, if you are a RATIONAL model - then you are aware of its future value, and thus once the BTC is purchased you yourself cannot call it $1000 anymore. Once the BTC is purchased, you know that it has a higher future value, and so that is the TRUE value. 
Before the BTC is ever purchased, the true value of $1000USD stays at $1000USD. But once you purchase the BTC, the true value of the BTC is much more than $1000.
Once you have made the conversion, you cannot spend it and simultaneously assume it is only worth $1000. The rational econ knows it's value is more than $1000, so you must say, I paid "$XXXX" for my rent, as opposed to, "I paid $1000.". You cannot say you paid $1000, because you are rationally aware of the future value.
That is why IF THERE IS NO DIFFERENCE (in current value) between paying $1000 in fiat and buying $1000 BTC then paying, then it is always smarter to just pay the $1000 in fiat.
If there was a DIFFERENCE, say - you received a discount for paying in BTC, then you could calculate if it was worth it to make the conversion based on the future value compared to the discount.
But bottom line is that there is NO difference in the moment between paying $1000 in fiat vs paying $1000 in BTC. You said this yourself. So if there isn't a difference then why pay in BTC? What is the BENEFIT? If there is no benefit, then it is smarter to pay with fiat, because the only real difference is in the future value of how you are paying. 
I'm just being technical, but you have to understand, in a rational model, the consumer is AWARE of the future value of the BTC and thus when you factor in the overall costs, it's smarter to pay in just fiat.
We know, it's the exact same in that moment. But in a full economic model, the consumer (tenant) is the loser in this situation when the future comes along.
The only way paying in BTC is smart is if you couldn't say for sure the future value of that BTC would be more than the current value of $1000 worth of BTC. But if he is a bitcoin investor, he DOES believe that the future value will be higher than it's current value, so it makes no sense to pay in BTC.

China announced they giving the other 2 major exchanges until end of Oct since they weren't doing the same stuff BTCC was.
Just be ready for another "crash" mid-Oct. Prepare to HODL again.
I'm more of a short term guy cuz I need the cash flow so I sold at $3750 this morning, it did go to $3850 but its back to $3600-3650 now.
I would suspect a semi-healthy market (could even bump up over $4k again) until mid-Oct when it's only 2 weeks away from the exchanges closing, just like this monthm 2 weeks out from BTCC closing we had a big dip, imagine when 2 more exchanges are nearing closure.
Am I saying that BTC gonna crash BELOW $3k? Maybe not, but if you don't think there won't be any dip at all when 2 more exchanges near closure you are crazy!
Long story short is to either HODL past Oct31st, or sell now and buy back mid-Oct.

Paying rent in BTC is like selling $1000 of BTC each month.  Are you willing to sell off $1000 of your coins each month, consistently, until it's gone?
I thought not. Anyone who sold off their investment $1000 at a time consistently each month would only be smart if they had infinite coins to sell or if they planned on exiting the market soon anyway and wanted to cash out their capital gains right now because they didn't expect their investment to offer any significantly greater return than it already had so far.

China announced they giving the other 2 major exchanges until end of Oct since they weren't doing the same stuff BTCC was.
Just be ready for another "crash" mid-Oct. Prepare to HODL again.
I'm more of a short term guy cuz I need the cash flow so I sold at $3750 this morning, it did go to $3850 but its back to $3600-3650 now.
I would suspect a semi-healthy market (could even bump up over $4k again) until mid-Oct when it's only 2 weeks away from the exchanges closing, just like this monthm 2 weeks out from BTCC closing we had a big dip, imagine when 2 more exchanges are nearing closure.
Am I saying that BTC gonna crash BELOW $3k? Maybe not, but if you don't think there won't be any dip at all when 2 more exchanges near closure you are crazy!
Long story short is to either HODL past Oct31st, or sell now and buy back mid-Oct.

The post is literally in regards to using BTC as a currency. Paying rent in BTC, automatically assumes that BTC is thus a valid form of currency, otherwise how would you "PAY" with it? You PAY with currencies.

So you admit, there is 0 difference between paying $1000 straight up and buying $1000 of BTC and transferring the BTC to the landlord; however, the one key difference is you knowingly bought something that would be worth more in the future and handed it off. Are you working for the landlord? Why not just let him make the investment himself. Why buy the BTC for him if it's no different. What is the BENEFIT I ask you, what is the BENEFIT of buying the BTC to pay rent as opposed to just paying with $1000 fiat? There isn't a BENEFIT, and therefore it's pointless and null at best. Best case scenario you wasted time by making one extra transaction with the exchanges as opposed to just writing a check for fiat.

I feel you. And on the EV my main point there is just that *knowing* the potential future of the market means once you join it (buy BTC) the EV of any USD you pump into it immediately increases upon purchase and so cannot be ignored by the rational consumer - even if the coin will be wiped from their hands shortly after, they cannot deny the actual EV of what they now hold after converting.
Honestly it's that EV, when you think about it, that makes "HODL" such a prominent and strong strategy amongst bitcoin enthusiasts. They all see and "expect" a higher value, so they refuse to let go of their coin even when things look bad or the market is losing momentum. And that stands even in a situation where someone has JUST bought coin and then the market proceeds to tumble. That person has already taken on *the EV of the coin they just bought and so cannot think to sell it even SHORTLY after, even when the market has gone DOWN shortly after (same hour, day, whatever)! Hopefully that clarifies the notion I'm getting at.
