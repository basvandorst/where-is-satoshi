This isnt 'making money on the side'.   It is hedging risk to have a significant ownership in a possible new banking system.    Those with all the money and wealth always have no problem getting into the new currency to protect them-selfs from the loss of money and power.     Controlling mining and stacking coins is the only way they can control these coins.

THey have most of the mining power.  Who knows, maybe the government owns that.    And yes, they are also significant buyers driving the price up.   But the crypto market doesnt need them nor any other individual country for that matter.

The Chinese government is well known for stopping new things that need red tape and regulation and then resuming later after regulation. If they find anything more in the crypto markets (and they will) they will do it again. This is well known in China throughout history and they have a name for it I cant remember. I would be surprised if the Chinese government doesnt take over all the exchanges for the rest of the world bank totalitarians to follow.    There is no other way to exact the best possible control and regulation to retain power.   A totalitarian government that has no control of the currency is no government anymore, especially when libertarian programmers are involved.
