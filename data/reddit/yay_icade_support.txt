No life-changing amount of bitcoin should be in one place.
I keep coin in local wallets and on-line wallets for a combination of easy access and security. I currently have four wallets I can use from my smartphone with a fifth that uses an encrypted private key on a physical card in the mail.

I have a Versocard.
It is one of five mobile wallets I have on my phone. I make sure that my bitcoin balance is spread between them. When I bought the Verso card I made sure that I used a complex password not used with any of my other mobile wallets.
If all someone does is buy a Versocard, made with the same crappy password they use for everything and load all their bitcoin into it, that is not secure.

The only point I think is a serious concern is: "Digital security is WAY behind digital currency". I work in IT support and nearly every day I see people make the same security mistakes as people made 10 or 15 years ago. At least 75% of the computer users I deal with will not be able to keep hold of any bitcoin for any length of time before someone or something malicious takes it from them.
I have no immediate solution to this.
Discussing security with these people makes their eyes glaze over. After one person was told they had a virus on their PC and they should change any passwords they typed in since the infection (caused by opening an email attachment) AND any passwords on accounts that use the same email/username/password, they complained that that's *all* their passwords they'd have to change.

I bought an iced coffee with bitcoins today (0.00433 of them, damn Perth prices) and I've experienced PayPass transactions that have taken longer.
The barista ran an app on his iPad that generated a QR code (20 seconds?), I aimed my Blockchain.info app at the code (10 seconds?), clicked on confirm, waited maybe 10 seconds before it asked for my secondary password. It took me another 15 seconds to remember and type that, then the transaction took probably about a minute.
Two minutes isn't bad and it's a hell of a lot faster than the last time I tried to pay with anything other than cash or a credit card.

You may not be able to redesign an ASIC for a new task, but you can design new coins for old ASICs by using a multi-step hash where only one part uses SHA-256 and another part uses the CPU/GPU to put a cap on how many ASICs someone can effectively use per computer.  That way a datacentre packed wall to wall with ASICs can't just trample over home miners.

A Ponzi scheme is a scam that claims to be a managed investment fund returning a profit through traditional investment while in fact it uses new investors money to pay for any money anyone wants to withdraw.
As early investors pull out their profits and initial investments the fund slowly runs dry until it collapses, leaving all remaining investors with nothing.
