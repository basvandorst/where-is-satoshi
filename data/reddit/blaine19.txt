First off, economists routinely use these videos as examples of Alan Grayson being a grandstanding jackass.
Second, 9 trillion dollars is not missing. 
Third, the Fed lent money out to central banks to prevent a global financial meltdown. The names of those banks are publicly available.

By that logic every time an Ivy-league or UC economist does research on a government policy their positive results are not to be trusted.
I'm not... I'm kind of done with this sub. Between being called a shill and getting conspiracy theories thrown at me by I think I should probably bow out before I have to start explaining how trade works. Not that I'm saying you're arguing in bad faith, it's just that I'm tired.

In order to prevent a financial crisis, you can't publicly loan to many corporations who need the money for short-term liquidity because they'll refuse the money, as it makes them look insolvent and further drives down faith in the economy. Huge banks were public, yes. But that's because all of them participated in the TARP programs so the strong banks would provide cover for the banks that actually needed them.

Correlation does not imply causation. Yes, the impact of a president's policies on the economy may be taken into consideration. That is not the same as, "I'm going to use my position as Fed Chairman to sabatoge Donald Trump."

Are you trying to tell me that the scientific method wasn't followed by people who spent years getting their PhD at Ivy leagues where they were supposed to learn the scientific method?

Which is supported by the data.

Most of their balance sheet is open to the public. There are some parts that were kept confidential.

It's a shame, really, that many people in this country don't have opportunity. That's what i support a basic income and more funding for education. 
The problem with blaming this on the Fed is that it's illegal for the Fed to loan to small businesses and such unless the purpose is to keep the economy stable.

I provided a plausible reason. You replied with conspiracy-mongering. Give a reason why 10 years is too long to be reasonable.

The USD sees stable inflation rates of near 2%. Stable inflation rates are good. 
A currency that is designed to deflate is better off as a commodity to invest in, not as a medium of exchange.

The FOMC argued that giving the public information about its inner workings too soon would cause harm because it would lead to “exaggerated market response.” 
You have to say something else than, "Nuh uh they're corrupt cause banks = evil"

They *are* audited. Their records are checked by three separate agencies. Their balance sheets are public. Their financial statements are audited. They are public too.
When people say they want to "audit" the Fed nowadays, they say that they want Congress to have direct control over the central bank. 
@_date: 2017-07-13 12:52:43
Uh huh. Tell me, would you rather have your life savings denominated in a currency that sees 70% swings in a year and will inevitably go through deflation which discourages spending and throws the economy out of whack?  




I can't hear you over my stable inflation rates.


Half the Bitcoin miners are in China and are becoming increasingly centralized. I'm sure putting the currency controls in a foreign country being run by a Communist Party is sooo much better than stable ~2% inflation. 


What a huge surprise, you think fractional reserve (((banking))) is a scam. 


Oh god, what a travesty that a government has to exist to enforce rule of law to have a functioning society. 


I go to Walmart and hand over $2 to buy Ron Paul's *End The Fed*. I get $1.99 back in change. My transaction confirmation is less than a minute.

My apologies, I routinely get accused of being a shill so I sometimes badly miscalculate how much interest people have in debating in good faith.




Alan Grayson has a degree in economics. He knows how interest rates work. He knows that half a trillion dollars is a drop in the bucket and its effects on international exchange rates are negligible. But fair point, let's engage with the arguments and not the person.




He also knows that in order to prevent a financial crisis, you can't publicly loan to many corporations who need the money for short-term liquidity because they'll *refuse the money*, as it makes them look insolvent and further drives down faith in the economy. Huge banks were public, yes. But that's because all of them participated in the TARP programs so the strong banks would provide cover for the banks that actually needed them. 
 




IIRC it's because of privacy laws and concerns. The central banks may have refused the money if they were required to turn over the information. Also, the above explanation partly applies.


Because the entire world was affected by the crisis. Only providing loans to American firms wouldn't have stopped short-term interest rates internationally from going up much.

The job of the Federal Reserve is to keep the economy stable. It's borderline illegal for them to loan to individuals and small businesses because it's not within their mandate.
@_date: 2017-07-13 13:15:29


Not a bad thing if it's stable. Money is a medium of exchange.

Store of value is less of an issue as long as inflation is predictable and there are assets that retain or increase in value, like stocks.

The Supreme Court is even more independent, yet they could do even more if abused. Congress also has the power to revoke their power, and the Supreme Court. It's hard to imagine a single bigger level of power than that.

Maybe it's too long, but it doesn't stink to high-heaven. The Fed is probably the most technocratic government agency and more than half of the FOMC are academics and not bankers.

I answered that. You replied with a non-sequitur.
Yeah, no. I'm done. You're clearly not interested in knowing what the experts believe. You apparently trust the words of a politician than the consensus of economists who understand the scientific method.

Donald Trump becomes president. The FOMC is pretty sure his policies will hurt the economy in some way. They discuss that, and take that into account when holding the vote. 
They feel safe with being frank about it because it's released ten years later when Donald's out of power, and they don't have to worry as much about short-term political pressures.
@_date: 2017-07-13 02:48:01
No, they're not. All the TARP loans have been paid back. Those firms are on their own, and have been for years.  
@_date: 2017-07-13 03:32:56
The TARP loans were paid back. This is literally a fact.
@_date: 2017-07-13 22:18:09
The Fed is pretty powerful, but it's not all (((powerful))). It's also completely moronic to think,
"Policy X might cause unemployment to increase slightly, we should take that into account when deciding to raise interest rates"
Is a fucking conspiracy.
