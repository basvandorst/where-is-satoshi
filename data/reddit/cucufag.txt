Only 0.8 coins. People told me if a small amount of money like this stings, I shouldn't be in bitcoins, but that is in stark contrast to what bitcoin is trying to achieve. We're not all big time investors. I really like bitcoins, have a bit more in other wallets, and will probably continue to use it to support merchants who accept them. When I originally put the money in, I had some extra cash I didn't need so I thought I'd buy some coins.
I'm extremely tight on money this month, to the point where I might need to start borrowing. I figured I could just pull some money out of gox, but big NOPE. You'd imagine an exchange would let you take your money out.
Pls Mt.Gox, I just want my money back.

They got away with it.
@_date: 2014-03-01 09:07:37
It works out if they ever reopen and everything gets fixed.
@_date: 2014-03-01 20:43:21
We're getting there.
@_date: 2014-01-03 05:44:04
sigh... I'll give it to you.

Man that's taking up such a huge part of his screen.

You sure that doesn't just make them Canadian?

Real obvious when the picture in OP's post clearly captured him saying the words "massive crash on/before January 31st. It's just a few days from now, if I was you, I would cash out".
What a colossal piece of shit. He's no different from those lunatics that call dates of the rapture, only to weasel out and recall another date after. If Bitcoin crashes, it sure as hell won't be because of anything this guy claimed. Nor will it be any of the random ass dates he regurgitated out of nowhere.

Liquidation of mtgox still pending; might bottom out a tad bit further down when it happens. Maybe.
@_date: 2014-02-25 16:36:19
Shit happens. 
@_date: 2014-03-02 10:54:43
Well, things you've just listed all happens to people. It's happening to me. I wanna pull out but I'm holding.
@_date: 2014-09-18 06:01:07
*sigh* I guess I'll buy some bitcoins and spend it at overstock for my next pokemon game purchase.
@_date: 2014-03-26 17:09:08
No. They'll stay quiet and wait for everyone to forget.
But we won't. We won't.
@_date: 2014-03-26 18:19:47
Well for starters, we stop storing coins in exchanges. I learned that lesson the hard way.
@_date: 2014-01-27 09:30:11
I'm not big on using mBTC, but I do agree with OP about one thing. The large value on a BTC, and people's lack of knowledge on the divisibility of a coin, scares almost everyone I've ever talked to about BTC.
As silly and stupid as it may seem, switching our standard to mBTC will probably help introduce a lot more people who are just too afraid of the big numbers to learn about bit coins.

The restaurant I work at is a victim of this. It has 4 "featured" reviews, which are all negative, and the average star rating is based on only those 6 reviews. It keeps us at 1.5/5 stars.
And then we have a dozen of hidden "not recommended by yelp" reviews, which are overall positive and would actually push us above 4/5 if counted.
When trying to resolve the issue with support, they demanded that we pay up a rather large amount of "partnership" money for display "select reviews" rather than their so called "random reviews". If you do a quick google search of this, you'll find that a vast number of small restaurants suffer terribly from this extortion that yelp has been accused of.
Yelp's plan is pretty simple. "Randomly" pick some reviews to "feature" a restaurant, and have a sort of premium account that these restaurant owners can buy for a hefty sum of money to remove the "randomness". [This]( is their denial. Yes, they had to make a video to deny these accusations. You can see the bullshit leaking out by the gallon in this video.

I've always known that bitcoins is the greatest thing to happen to merchants, but its been pretty hard to talk up secure purchasing for the users.
I'm seeing some people mention 3rd parties that help, which is an okay step in reassurance.
Thanks for the response.
@_date: 2014-02-19 22:20:33
The amount of ignorance and hate in the comments for this article is absolutely staggering. With all this circlejerk about how much we all love bitcoins and how they're getting closer to becoming mainstream, I almost slipped in to the belief that the average person is going to think bitcoins aren't some insane scam by a shady organization that gives you "fake money".
We still have a long way to go.
@_date: 2014-02-19 22:01:00
10k... that's generous and neat.
My student loans for two years in a university exceeds that.
@_date: 2014-02-20 00:19:28
There's a large number of factors, both psychological and economical. The biggest reason is a lack of understanding though. Bitcoin is still a radically difficult concept for a lot of people.
@_date: 2014-12-01 00:39:20
People keep trying to place a label on bitcoins, comparing it to other forms of money that have existed in the past.
I feel like bitcoins just don't fit any of those categories. It's a totally new thing. It's hard to wrap your head around something that's not just a new form of what previously existed, but rather a new concept entirely. It's probably one of the biggest barriers bitcoin faces.
Bitcoin could be described as natural money, but it doesn't necessarily share the same pros/cons of natural money in the past.
@_date: 2014-03-26 18:22:23
Isnt whistle blowing at your own expense similar? The scale is different, but the overall story is the same.
@_date: 2014-11-03 12:36:49
This is really cool.
And a terrible idea. I wish it well, but you'll probably want to still accept local currency while you're at it. And the pricing might not be good fixed like that, coffee could be worth twice as much the next day, or half as much another.
@_date: 2014-02-19 21:56:28
Sounds like banks.
@_date: 2014-03-02 04:07:13
Pfft. And you keep your cash under the bed because you don't trust banks right?
@_date: 2014-10-28 13:54:55
I disagree. You're approaching this in the absolute worst way imaginable.
For bitcoins to be all that we envision it to be, it needs common acceptance. And for common acceptance, it needs to be marketed in a way that can be most easily understood by the masses.
The Whole Bitcoin problem is not a matter of retardation, but a combination of ignorance and a lack of interest. I know a very large number of intelligent individuals who are often caught up in this aspect simply because they aren't educated on it, nor do they find it relevant to their lives. I'm talking people with grad students, department leads for IT, or even some with PhD's.
We do not forsake the average joe when asking for a global currency to catch on to the point where coffee is directly priced in it. Though sometimes in our own stubborn pride we seem to be setting the bar much higher than even the average joe.
It's easy to get wrapped up in a topic you're interested or heavily vested in and start forgetting that other people might not be as interested as you far in the matter. Bitcoin is constantly one of those things imo.
@_date: 2014-04-06 22:18:44
Yes and no.
You won't get much business via bitcoins, but general acceptance is what promotes and increases the market. It starts with each individual merchant and consumer.
The best thing is that it won't really cost you much to accept bitcoins so there is little to no reason not to add it as an option.
@_date: 2014-01-03 05:50:50
Not to be dismissive, and of course certain bars are much too busy or wild for this to work well, but most international airports nowadays actually have bars that take your order directly from ipads connected to the tables. So the system is actually already in place and fully functional. All they have to do is integrate bitcoin payments.
@_date: 2014-02-07 09:11:11
Man when I got in to bitcoins a few months ago I asked about this site and everyone said it was okay. Now I'm 300 dollars locked in and terrified of whether I can get it out or not.
@_date: 2014-10-28 11:28:36
Everyone I've talked to, in order to try to get them to try it out, are always telling me that a WHOLE bitcoin is SO expensive now, they can't.
You can just buy... less than whole... but okay.
@_date: 2014-09-24 16:57:35
They won't even take PayPal. Had the toughest time making a 2000 dollar purchase the other day because my bank was limiting my transaction to 500 on my card and there was no other option when purchasing directly from amazon.
If they don't even take PayPal, bitcoin has a lot more traction to go before they consider it.

This needs to be upvoted more. I don't think there is any more conclusive evidence needed to convince me that Dorian could not be Satoshi Nakamoto.
I dare say you may have spent more time on this research than Leah has looking for Satoshi. Incredible job.
@_date: 2014-07-10 03:21:55
It's great that he's speaking out, but it's bad that we're just losing more people who are actually good for bitcoin from the foundation.
@_date: 2014-11-09 15:24:27
Like, it's not that I necessarily agree with you, but if you had asked everyone in this board at this exact date last year, they would've told you that each coin would be worth like 10k+ by now.
We've plateaued, for now anyways, and I feel like we might be stuck here for a little while longer until something big happens.
@_date: 2015-08-14 14:12:23
Man, I don't know why people keep doing business with shitty banks that nickel and dime you for every little action you take.
I bank with a credit union now and I haven't been charged a single fee since I opened my account years ago. They also have lower interest rates on EVERYTHING. Once, US bank begged me to come back and offered 200 dollars for direct depositing in to my account for two months. I did it just to get my money and get out, and I was blown away by how many fees there were for doing anything at all. Checking my account, withdrawing money, not using my account, etc etc. It's amazing how many people in America just let this happen when there are better options right under their noses.
@_date: 2015-03-29 10:37:00
I feel like they're not a significant force of any real relevance. I feel like we're just trying to start something here.
As with most debates, you'll never convince your direct opponents of anything most of the time. In fact, you'll usually reinforce their beliefs when you argue with them. What we always want to accomplish is to convince the onlookers who are on the fence about their opinions in the matter.
@_date: 2013-12-20 21:54:19
I don't think you have shitty friends, like a lot of redditors here are suggesting. Money does influence the psychology of people. If you're living paycheck to paycheck, your mental fortitude might not be solid enough to withstand the kind of alluring information that bitcoin offers.
Can't really say I'm any better myself.
We all dogecoins now.
@_date: 2013-12-21 07:14:14
I want to see this follow up, lol. 
@_date: 2013-12-26 21:45:37
I'm actually totally okay with this.
@_date: 2013-12-23 22:01:45
One of my friend's argument against why he would never use bitcoins is that it is a very easy platform for illegal transactions and promotes growth in underground trading. I guess it means a lot to him.
I haven't been able to really argue back on this point. I don't know enough about bitcoins to know how it won't lead to a very easy way for people to partake in illegal drug trades or human trafficking or whatever. And of course, if this becomes wide spread enough, governments will want to stop it and put laws against it, which could lead to us losing all our bitcoins. If I'm correct, this happened already, didn't it? Does anyone else have the answer?
@_date: 2013-12-23 21:21:42
Technically though, stealing the money with intention of returning it is significantly safer and better than letting it go. As OP said; someone else would've done it for sure.
Minimized damage of public perception is better than complete damage.
