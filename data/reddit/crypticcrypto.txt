Do a 10ish block demonstration with everyone at the party. Give everyone a unique number, 1- people. Use a timer to simulate mining/block time, and pick a number to determine who gets the newly mined coins. Everyone should have a piece of paper, to simulate being a node. When someone sends coin to another person at the table, everyone records the transaction.
Take it from here...you can get as detailed as you want, maybe give everyone a slightly different hashpower, so some people will have a stronger chance to win the block reward. Have fun!

If you can hodl for say 15-20 years, any Satoshi will either have some value- worth hodling, or virtually nothing-in which case a full Bitcoin would be down to a dollar or less. Hopefully things go well, and at an even greater pace than decade, but some is better than none.
Think of it this way- A list with 21 million lines, no more. Each line has 100 million entries, no more.
For scale, this is enough for 8 billion people to have 262,500 entries each, roughly 12 dollars worth currently.

I am confused...not a lambo.

The barrier to enter and exit is still fairly high. Even if you were to go to a Bitcoin ATM, or local Bitcoin, you will pay a hefty premium in either case. There may be better options than coinbase, but don't vent too hard over it.

The Xbox is a home gaming console. Games are separately purchased items containing games you play via the Xbox. 
Bitcoin is an open list that stores the distribution of value in a system ran on the internet. Anyone can run a program/app at home that will automatically update their list so they can be aware of the state of things in the system. There are 21 million lines on the list. There will never be more than that. Each line can hold up to 100 million entries. 
He got some dollars when he sold his Xbox and games. Then he bought some entries on one of the lines of the list. 
Now everyone with the list can see he is in control of the entries he just bought. The entry was assigned to someone else before he bought them but, when the list is updated, he is now the current owner of the entries.

POW is what is backing up Bitcoin. Real cost to successfully mine.
Edit: word removal. Two to's down to the appropriate one.

It has yet to achieve the technical ability to do useful transactions for Mass consumer use. Similar to how email in the early 90's was around, but more work than most people would want to put in, they just sent a letter. Patience must be on a decade+ scale IMO for this "usefulness" to be achieved.

It took me a sec to even find the S&amp;P line.

Zcash started out with very small supply, and the price per coin was insane at first. So it came down a bunch as more coins were mined, reached a low, and has overall been slowly increasing, until today.

The origination of this word was a drunken typo of hold, correct?

I read this as two old ladies talking about one of their husbands, well, trying to get it up. 5k flying half mast.

ZEC is not in red anymore!
Edit: I am a moron. Still in red, big time, just less big time than the image above.

Selling a Bitcoin would upgrade the aquarium design quite nicely! 
Or wait until price rises and sell a few Satoshi for a real world item. And keep the Mrs happy.

Typically it is referring to spreading out your investment portfolio, in this case I would guess he means getting other crypto, an alt coin or two if you will. Traditionally, diversifying would be to spread your investment over multiple types of things, so Bitcoin as the crypto portion, then perhaps invest in a medical company, or a food company. 
This is all in an effort to spread out your risk, so if one sector goes kapoot, you will not be sunk as well. 
Edit: spelling

And don't sweat the purchase fees too much, difficult to avoid some fees when going fiat-&gt;crypto. And the gains from purchases 8+ months ago.....I think you have come out ahead ��

And some tissue. This crypto stuff can get messy.

Not sure what it says either, but you are responsible enough to be able to blow/lose 200 bucks a month without noticing, and in this case, it was lost for a purpose, so kudos to you. And now that it is found, enjoy!

As he stated, yes. But only the BTC associated with the address/es involved in the transaction. Following the transaction history of the received coins to try and figure out if they originally came from a fat stack on the other hand, I am unsure how hard/easy it would be.

Copay is tailored for business type stuff. Coinomi is a solid multicoin wallet.

The classic Hodler look when overhearing someone talking about keeping their coins on an exchange.

Maybe 2nd best time was 6 years ago...
But yeah, now is right up there!
