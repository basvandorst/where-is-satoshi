In theory, if one can pay for hosting and domain names in bit coin, and that hosting was made private so a whois would just show the hosting companies' name, could one now anonymously own and operate a website?

Are any online sites safe enough to add a bank account too? How long does buying bitcoin through that take?

Hmm that sounds like it would take a while. Do you know any faster ways to get bitcoin?

There's a difference between "No regulation" and "Concise and smart regulation" in a libertarian world, people still need rules that ensure the "openness" and "freeness" of the market, and a host of other things. The government, laws, and justice obviously still exist, its just that the mindset behind making these laws focuses on the individual *liberty* of the citizen.

Of course not. but the emails are actually coming from an  address, thats whats making this all screwy. Any idea whats going on?

Interesting. Why does it become too diverse to follow? What about having so many makes it hard? Do the bitcoins ever end up back in one wallet so you can spend them en mass?

Okay, that kind of makes sense. 
If multiple people put it all into one illicit address though, would it not then be safe to assume that all 10 are trying to launder? Why not?
Could pooling not also be considered a valid pattern to be recognized?
