Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox has received a subpoena from federal prosecutors in New York, according to a person familiar with the matter, dealing another blow to the embattled marketplace for buyers and sellers of the virtual currency.
Mt. Gox, one of the largest bitcoin exchanges, shut down on Tuesday, underscoring the risks of bitcoin, the virtual currency that has seen a meteoric rise in the past year. The subpoena was sent this month and asked Mt. Gox to preserve certain documents among other things, the person said.

I thought it was a bit strange to hear from circle in the joint statement considering they arent 'open' to the public yet. Maybe the feds issued the subpoena because they are on to something. I mean of all those in the joint statement, why circle?!

@_date: 2014-02-26 11:30:19
Maybe people should just leave them alone. If everyone starts to pester them they may get annoyed and cut ties with bitstamp and then fiat withdrawals will be screwed.
On another note, I hope bitstamp has other banks in the pipeline as backups.

Why can't he just give a more in-depth reason and plans?!

I lost several hundred BTC myself. Imagine if you're one of those who lost 1k+. Would you still feel the same? As much as people say "trade with what you're okay to lose," those with large holdings took it seriously and deserve the respect. If I did your job for shits and giggles while you took it seriously, would it mean less then?
@_date: 2014-02-26 04:18:02
Regarding general details of Mt Gox status.
@_date: 2014-03-05 03:39:25
It's just trading volume. Here is an example:
Imagine I trade roughly 100 BTC per trade, four times per day = 400 BTC/daily
Now do that 6 times per week = 2400 BTC per week
Do it for one month = 9600 BTC per month = $4.8 million per month in trading volume @ $500 per BTC
For a grand total of $28.8 million in 6 months from one person.

Super slow reply, but I have lived off bitcoins (more or less) for about 1.5 years. I'm talking about the average person. To say you can't convert back makes it seem shady. I don't need gold, silver, etc. I need CASH to pay my mortgage and car. Show me a lender that accepts those things (or Bitcoin) and I'll agree, but for now, you have to take the blinders off and be pragmatic. 
* I'm a professional trader and involved with several large Bitcoin businesses, but even I know the limitations. Being bullish always and never selling is far from being smart with any commodity.

Yes please someone explain this address I found yesterday when trying to find where a deposit of some of my bitcoins went.
It is extremely fishy considering each transaction has each address output doubled with the exact same amount. Is this a mixing service or a bunch of the same transactions being bundled together too many times (transaction malleability?)
@_date: 2014-03-04 21:53:44
I've been using this website since it's launching and I am surprised it has only done $150 mil in trading volume; especially considering I did probably  probably ~1/6th of their total volume.
This isn't big news and that volume isn't even a lot.
* I execute my trades through it, but their trading engine is slow to update and I rely on other sites for faster order updates.
@_date: 2014-08-30 04:15:19
All these people saying the system is so corrupt and Charlie is being screwed, but one only needs to actually read the actual docs. If you replaced Charlie/bitcoin with someone/something non-bitcoin else, everyone would be screaming "down with the corruption!"
You hate corruption in politics/banks, but its okay when it involves Bitcoin?
Sorry Charlie. You shouldn't have been doing what you were doing in the position you had (or in any other for that matter).

I believe I might have been sent 0.2 BTC once by accident. This was days before the halting of withdrawals. 
Made withdrawal for 0.2 BTC -&gt; Did not show on blockchain.
Made another withdrawal for 0.2 BTC -&gt; On blockchain within minutes.
~~Day later received 0.2 BTC twice hours apart~~ Received later that same day the other 0.2 BTC and two days later 0.2 BTC again.
Didn't look into it since my wife and I sent small amounts back and forth to one another often. However, I asked her about it a couple days later and she denied sending me.
It was such a small amount compared to my holdings that I didn't care to look into it.
Looks like in first two transactions the BTC originated from deepbit (some kind of mining pool; new coins; different addresses). 
This is Deepbit's address **1VayNert3x1KzbpzMGt2qdqrAThiRovi8**. The third came from a new wallet/address. So basically, **Deepbit -&gt; Mtgox -&gt; Me**. I'm curious why it was such a short pathway to me from gox. 
In the "Mtgox" wallet, there is a transaction from Deepbit -&gt; Me + Deepbit as if it was returning some coins back to the pool. Is this a normal way newly minted coins are spent?
All withdrawals were done to my phone's bitcoin wallet. It's my throwaway wallet that is used for on the go and small amounts.

From what I have heard, Coinme takes your money first and then KYCs you. If you aren't able to get past the KYC for any reason, they keep your money. 
Disregarding fees and/or markups, bitcoin ATMs may be higher fees but they serve a particular market segment and usually make it easy to buy and sell instantly. Although, I utilize online services, any offline service is going to have significant overhead. For example with ATMs, armed guard services to pickup and restock machines, purchase/deployment/upkeep of machines, handling price volatility during transactions, etc. So of course they aren't going to be able to offer the same fees as online counterparts. To each their own I say.

Having your phone number as an option for account recovery is actually a critical flaw to the right hacker. For example, when recovering an account you are able to select voice call or text message with recovery pin. If one were able to "take over" your phone they would setup call forwarding to another number to listen to the pin. Doing so is extremely easy; all it takes is a call to a mobile phone carrier and saying the magic words, "I'm switching service, can you please forward calls to my new number." I assure you it's that easy, therefore I always recommend two-factor authentication.

Bitstamp appears to exceed the trading volume when trading goes sideways on Mt Gox, but look on any busy day and they aren't even close. This must be marketing at work or someone trying to pump up bitstamp. Look at the sum ask and  sum bid; you will see that mt gox exceeds it by 5-10 times!
However, one good thing about bitstamp is that you can make money by watching mt gox as everyone seems to follow mt gox movements.

As someone who trades quite a bit, I can tell you don't. Sell/buy 1+ K coins on bitstamp and see what happens. There is no liquidity. Do that at Mt Gox and you might move the price $1....temporarily.
I would love for bitstamp to grow and be able to trade there, however at this time, it really is just not feasible for an intraday trader.

I accidentally gave out a send address to someone I sold an item to for 20 btc. After realizing the mistake I became frantic because I was unsure who owned the address. I normally create new addresses for all transactions for accounting purposes, however this was one of a few I had not done so. Finally, I figured out it was gyft and contacted them. It took a bit of explaining because bitpay is their processor and gyft did not know what to do (understanding of bitcoins). In the end gyft and bitpay worked together and helped get them back to me. I was literally pulling my hair out thinking I was kissing $2k+ away for a stupid mistake until that happened.
p.s. blessed be the blockchain and having public transactions. It helped prove where the money was at all times.
