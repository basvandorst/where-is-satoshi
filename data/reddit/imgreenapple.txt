and what if i send it in parts of 0.01? it’ll choose the first incoming 0.01 for each outgoing 0.01?
@_date: 2018-01-15 18:45:23
i think either this or actually the entire cryptocurrency marketcap
@_date: 2018-01-15 13:53:31
if we want something that’s changing, let’s put the price there. or market cap. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 15:49:25
my apologies. tho maybe you’ll find something helpful in the comments as well :)
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:41:13
i’ve been doing that as well, really like the technology and i keep understanding more and more of it as i keep learning. :)
@_date: 2017-12-13 15:50:32
that’s a great one. i’ve actually been obviously doing that but putting my main focus on it is a better idea. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:20:29
that sounds like a great plan, i’ll look into it
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:21:02
do you use some kind of btc debit card for every day purchases?
@_date: 2018-08-24 13:46:58
when i look at my portfolio, even my nose hurts. 
@_date: 2018-05-01 03:15:25
well of course. i just mean it might not be the best for 100k or so transactions but it’s exactly for every day purchases. coffe was just an example because it’s been kind of a topic. 
@_date: 2018-08-13 07:03:35
op should’ve added the “w”.
@_date: 2018-05-01 03:20:48
imo LN is for every tx that’s small enough so you don’t want to pay the network fee or you don’t have the time to wait. exactly things like groceries, coffe, gas, etc. when buying a tv for example or a new phone, i’d use a regular on-chain transaction. 
just my opinion. 
@_date: 2018-05-16 22:21:48
Is possible to see my total bitcoin balance of a single wallet in a block explorer if i used a new address every time i received a transaction? Or am i understanding correctly that this is the point of not re-using wallet addresses?
@_date: 2017-08-23 18:05:11
it would've been much better if the amount had been 20,000,000 
@_date: 2017-08-12 16:35:11
i will sell at 5000/5500 some and set a limit to buy back when goes lower. 
@_date: 2017-08-12 20:54:29
should segwit rise or lower the price? just opinions :)
@_date: 2017-08-01 21:50:26
so just to clarify, can i transfer (with QR code) my BTC in Electrum to Breadwallet and then import the Electrum private key to a wallet that supports BCH? 
and why won't transfering the btc from my electrum key already empty the key? does it just empty it for BTC, and not for BCH?
@_date: 2017-08-29 18:08:43
i've been waiting for this
@_date: 2017-08-01 23:00:08
it's not available for ios unfortunately 
@_date: 2017-08-01 22:50:20
not yet. im still looking for a wallet that supports BCH
@_date: 2017-08-29 16:01:21
im on ios. i think electrum is for Android only
@_date: 2017-08-02 04:52:31
yeah that makes sense. 
@_date: 2017-08-28 11:58:02
It's a great app to get quick prices on the go.
A minor UI fix: when launching the app, the rotating loading icon is in the bottom of the screen. Would look better in the middle.
Later (if that's whay you want) when expanding the details of a coin, it would be nice if a 7day chart appears as well. It doesn't need to be nothing complicated, just to get a quick overview on your mobile.
Edit: just a quick question, did you make it all using Swift? (the iOS version)
@_date: 2017-08-05 11:47:35
what will happen to the price after segwit?
@_date: 2017-08-26 22:07:35
yeah this is a little different, he's taking the initiative, basically asking ppl in a supermarket who lost their wallets to help search. 
@_date: 2017-08-29 14:37:41
If this happens and bitcoin goes mainstream, we definitely need to start using smaller units like mBTC and so on. 
@_date: 2017-08-01 21:25:06
Is it possible for Bitcoin to crash and die forever?
@_date: 2017-08-01 21:52:36
wondering the same
@_date: 2017-08-12 12:31:38
congrats! 
what actual services you use? (exchanges/wallets/portfolio trackers) would be interesting to know.
and if you want to share, how old are you?
@_date: 2017-08-31 12:10:08
doesn't it require you to be 18?
@_date: 2017-08-26 12:35:41
irl often if you find someone's wallet and return it, they give you some cash. 
@_date: 2017-08-05 01:05:53
what do you recommend? does CoPay for iOS have custom fees?
@_date: 2017-08-01 22:29:55
and i need to write down (print) all 27 rows with 2 keys on each row that Electrum gives me?
@_date: 2017-08-01 18:36:53
My coins (Bitcoin) are currently in Electrum. What do i have to do to get my Bitcoin cash also? And will it still keep my Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-08-28 21:28:46
I'm currently few weeks into learn Swift. Will definitely check React out
@_date: 2017-08-01 22:15:49
so the BTC key will be good to import to a BCH wallet basically forever?
and after i transact the BTC, and i want to still keep it in electrum, i should create a new wallet to get new private keys?
@_date: 2017-08-29 15:05:41
breadwallet, copay, airbitz 
@_date: 2017-08-29 16:00:28
i'm using copay right now but maybe should go over to airbitz 
@_date: 2017-08-01 21:57:24
thank you! what wallet should i use for BCH?
@_date: 2018-06-17 17:35:13
penny-pump incoming 
@_date: 2017-08-12 16:44:56
coinbase requires verification to buy with Visa/Mastercard?
@_date: 2017-08-06 12:16:48
you shut just turn the monitor to have it vertically 
@_date: 2017-11-21 05:38:27
then we buy. and buy. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:44:59
why was 2x so hated compared to BTG or BCH? also why did the price jump when the fork was called off?
@_date: 2017-11-21 05:39:37
resistance around 8.2 so there could be a few more “dips”
@_date: 2017-11-20 23:56:03
i was with other people from my family, otherwise i’d have done it
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:04:27
got it, thanks
@_date: 2017-11-05 14:32:35
i’m on ios and i used to use breadwallet. tried copay for a while since the ui looked better but i guess in this case function &gt; looks. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 14:29:44
yeah. will go back to breadwallet then i guess
@_date: 2017-11-02 18:56:17
i was hoping ppl would understand it’s sarcasm but i guess not
@_date: 2017-11-20 23:38:43
exactly my reaction when i saw it, i’ve seen pictures of similar posters before so i got exited so see it irl until i started to read...
@_date: 2017-11-21 03:44:59
Tether (USDT) was hacket, about $30mm stolen i believe. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 05:43:03
i’ve been up too much lately haha so i’m just setting some buy orders for the night
@_date: 2018-03-10 20:30:08
that’s why i don’t want to use crypto that much yet. people assume that crypto = im a millionaire 
@_date: 2018-03-22 01:35:49
it would be nice to have it include posts from r/cryptocurrency and r/bitcoin that have more than 1k upvotes or even a dedicated site for just reddit.
regardless this will likely be my main crypto news source now ;). 
@_date: 2017-09-17 00:01:54
when will this be decided?
@_date: 2017-09-09 23:39:32
i'm afraid not. i used it with my EU bank account. 
@_date: 2017-09-09 20:08:12
Blockfolio is a great app to track the prices as well. It supports a ton of other coins too, if you get really into the crypto workld.
@_date: 2017-09-10 17:25:30
i'm actually thinking of going for a burger now, too
@_date: 2017-09-09 11:53:27
@_date: 2017-09-09 21:16:32
ATM fees are usually pretty high, but other than that, they work fine. 
@_date: 2017-09-17 00:23:17
also what he said about bitcoin being useful in countries like Venezuela, Ecuador or North Korea. Ecuador has had USD as their national currency for years now.
@_date: 2017-09-04 14:52:37
That's true, the dips can be longer and it won't be easy (especially for those who are newer i this crypto space) not to panic sell their coins when they see a decrease of over 50%
But what do you think about altcoins? Could this affect their prices also? Just your opinion :)
@_date: 2018-03-22 03:54:19
@_date: 2017-09-15 22:09:26
they have 2 sites, exchange.btcc.com and btcchina.com
@_date: 2017-10-26 15:36:22
such emergencies yes, it’s not great. what i mean is if something happens to your other investments, like stocks, that bitcoins won’t be affected by that
@_date: 2017-09-15 19:23:41
Is BTCC safe to trade with USD? They only accept passports in my country so i want to make sure it's legit before doing it. 
@_date: 2017-09-17 18:30:19
i copy and paste (or scan the qr), then check the 3-4 characters from both sides. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 14:58:43
as a gold substitute, yes definitely. ppl want gold as an investment that’s not a stock/currency, good for emergencies and bitcoin is that. 
and the issues preventing it from becoming an useable currency are fixable issues, mainstream adoption being one of the main ones, but still, fixable. 
@_date: 2017-09-09 20:09:48
try Bity.com. Works with a SEPA transfer.
@_date: 2017-09-09 16:43:47
sorry, but how do ppl know how much Satoshi has?
@_date: 2017-09-15 12:23:08
what are your options on how long will it take to recover?
@_date: 2017-09-09 20:09:12
Bity.com works with SEPA transfers, no ID required.
@_date: 2017-09-15 20:20:52
and they're not closing just their Chinese part?
@_date: 2017-09-15 12:23:08
what are your options on how long will it take to recover?
@_date: 2017-10-15 05:38:48
maybe around 6500-7000, depends on how high does it get before the fork. after the fork it will probably fall a little due to larger than normal sell offs. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 15:52:20
that’s correct 
@_date: 2017-10-17 02:44:04
What i mean is that for example if the price is 6000$ currently, i don’t want to set a buy order for 5000$ because let’s say BTC keeps rising to 7000$ and then falls to 6400$ within 24hours. It may never go as low as 5000$.  
That’s why i’d like to only buy if bitcoin falls 10, 20 or any other % within like 12-24hours. That means there migh be some fud or news that cause the price to fall. 
It’s that 10-20% fall is notable, whereas if i would choose for example 500$ fall or set a buy order for a specified price, we may never fall there. Or we may fall more during a dip. 
I hope you can understand :)
@_date: 2018-07-27 20:40:22
any idea how much ppl selling their verified accounts for?
@_date: 2017-09-09 16:46:31
of course, thanks!
@_date: 2017-10-20 15:24:24
definitely would love to see the results here!
@_date: 2017-10-26 14:49:32
for now it is, but also right now (other than an investment) i see bitcoin only as a way of online payments (example: PayPal/Venmo) that only makes sense for transferring larger amounts of money because of the fees. 
2-5$ fee when buying a 5$ burger makes little to no sense.
and as a currency, it’s way too volatile for now. one day the burger can be 5$, the next 7$. for it to be useable currently, we’d need to completely forget fiat currencies. 
i know, i’ll probably get downvotes for this, but that’s my opinion. 
@_date: 2017-09-10 17:24:54
they don't use BTC as a currency (the burger prices are still in USD), bitcoin is more like a way of payment in such cases, like Paypal or Apple Pay. 
@_date: 2018-04-26 20:44:31
while lightning is great, i think considering the principal idea of ProtonMail (&amp;VPN), support for Monero seems more important to me. 
@_date: 2018-04-08 03:03:00
those bills really look like they have that space specially for notes. 
@_date: 2018-04-30 02:25:07
well the point of LN is to be able to buy coffee. when you’re gonna buy a lambo you can pay the fee even if it’s $50. 
@_date: 2018-04-11 13:45:42
exactly. and i completely agree- this hold/hodl mentality is just dumb. 
@_date: 2018-04-11 12:47:06
i found a mistake, it’s not “Im gonna 30x *my* money”, instead it should be: “Im gonna 30x *someone’s* money this year”. 
@_date: 2018-04-29 13:28:40
it’s not gonna happen on most of crypto twitter until top exchanges start doing it because on twitter they talk about trades/investments etc and those prices are the same as on those exchanges. 
@_date: 2017-07-16 11:45:52
but if i move it from my account right when i get it?
@_date: 2017-07-20 21:02:13
yes... sorry i get that. i should've been more specific but i meant if i can import the keys of airbitz to electrum? and also what's the difference between a private key containing random numbers and letters vs a wallet seed with random words?
@_date: 2017-07-19 13:29:45
well is it safe/reliable?
@_date: 2017-07-20 20:51:41
thanks! im new to here but also what would be the best way to get my coins from AirBitz to Electrum?
@_date: 2017-07-20 21:12:14
so it's better to just send using the wallet address/qr code
@_date: 2017-07-10 11:11:20
paypal just lets them get the money back like that?
@_date: 2017-07-16 01:37:33
is it safe to sell with bank transfers?
@_date: 2017-07-13 21:40:45
is airbitz only a wallet? not an exchange 
@_date: 2017-07-15 19:22:39
@_date: 2017-07-09 20:02:06
why is paypal not safe?
@_date: 2017-07-15 22:21:22
im looking to selling bitcoin and i have the same concern with paypal. if i request bank transfer as a payment, will they still be able too chargeback?
@_date: 2017-07-18 19:58:34
you should check out Blockfolio. maybe helps
@_date: 2017-07-20 20:31:04
are my coins safe on a mobile wallet like AirBitz?
@_date: 2017-07-17 19:25:11
what about copay for iOS?
@_date: 2017-07-15 19:44:01
im no professional, but i have it on my
main laptop (Mac).
