My dear friend, from my point of view, the different applications and devices, have as a general trend the respective updates, since this way their functionality or operation is improved ... Anyone can not change their operating system from Windows 10 to Windows 95, simply because a video file does not work properly.
I have reviewed a similar application, as shown below and can only presume the lack of a variable ... ..
This is part of the code of your program:
def conv_pvkhex_to_bitcoinaddress_uncompressed (z):
    zk = ecdsa.SigningKey.from_string (z.decode ('hex'), curve = ecdsa.SECP256k1)
    zk_verify = zk.verifying_key
This is the code of a similar version:
def __private_to_public (private_key):
        private_key_bytes = codecs.decode (private_key, 'hex')
        # Get ECDSA public key
        key = ecdsa.SigningKey.from_string (private_key_bytes, curve = ecdsa.SECP256k1) .verifying_key
        key_bytes = key.to_string ()
        key_hex = codecs.encode (key_bytes, 'hex')
        # Add bitcoin byte
        bitcoin_byte = b'04 '
        public_key = bitcoin_byte + key_hex
        return public_key
The problem with the parallel version is that it runs very slowly,

Thanks for answering ... My program is version 3.6.5
And the data file works correctly with the conversion program privKey to WIF (brute-pvks.txt)
This is the error message that is generated
zk = ecdsa.SigningKey.from_string (z.decode ('hex'), curve = ecdsa.SECP256k1)
AttributeError: 'function' object has no attribute 'decode'
I honestly do not know how to fix it
