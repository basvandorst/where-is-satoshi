No and even if 51% of the network wanted to, they still couldn't. An attacker that controls more than 50% of the network's computing power can, for the time that he is in control, exclude and modify the ordering of transactions. This allows him to:
* Reverse transactions that he sends while he's in control
* Prevent some or all transactions from gaining any confirmations
* Prevent some or all other generators from getting any generations
The attacker can't:
* Reverse other people's transactions
* Prevent transactions from being sent at all (they'll show as 0/unconfirmed)
* Change the number of coins generated per block
* Create coins out of thin air
* Send coins that never belonged to him

Usually when people do arbitrage they have dollars/bitcoin on both exchanges already so withdrawal times don't matter. Buy bitcoins on one exchange then sell the same amount you already had ready on the other, getting dollars onto many of the exchanges is difficult and time consuming though, if it was easy then everyone would do it and the prices would balance out.

I'd expect most to refund in USD/AUD/EUR etc or the equivalent dollar value in bitcoins. So if you bought a $100 item, you would either be refunded $100 or $100 worth of bitcoin at the current exchange rate. It's unreasonable to expect a business to risk holding the bitcoins given the volatility.

From the [FAQ]( on their website
There will never be more than 11,000 of the original series coins, probably much fewer than this. This coin can be identified by a misspelling of "CASASCIUS" in the small background print (the middle S is missing).  As of December 2011 I have made about 3500, and the final count will be further limited by other factors
I have published a list of all the Bitcoin addresses pre-generated for the original project, and maybe someone out there can take this list and scan the block chain and tell us just how many unspent ones there are out there.
48,800 addresses are listed.
The first 11,000 belong to series 1 coins with inkjetted holograms.
The next 1,000 addresses belong to series 2 coins with windowed holograms.
The next 17,000 addresses also belong to series 2 coins, but also start with a prefix that
suggests how the address might be used.
The next 9,900 addresses (prefix 12) are for 2013 0.5 BTC coins or 2013 1 BTC coins.
The next 9,900 addresses (prefix 13) are for 2013 1 BTC coins or 2013 0.5 BTC coins.

It's called [arbitrage]( and yes, given the price differences could be profitable but because the price is so volatile at the moment is also quite risky, there are fees and it can't be done instantly, who knows where the price is going to be in a few hours/days.
@_date: 2013-04-23 16:36:40
They use a payment processor like bitpay. Customer pays in bitcoin, merchant receives fiat. Too much risk given the volatility currently otherwise, replacing QR codes constantly throughout the day isn't very practical.

When you get access again, set up a paper wallet. An online wallet is not safe. 
You can check the balance by looking up the address on blockexplorer and if blockchain.info gets hacked your bitcoins are still safe as long as you don't lose the private key associated with it. I keep one printed out and another on USB but if I had anything substantial I'd keep them in a safe.

Yes they would be lost forever. Since bitcoin is infinitely divisible though (down to 0.00000001 btc currently) even a single bitcoin would be enough for everyone, it would just be worth a lot more then it is now.

Buy some bitcoins. Personally I think it's too late to start mining unless you either have access to free electricity or preorded an ASIC months ago.

Mining is how transactions are verified. Basically miners search for a block of unconfirmed transactions on the network and try and solve it, once that block is solved those transactions become confirmed and whoever solved it first is rewarded in bitcoins, or in the case of pools the reward is split between everyone based on how much they contributed.
The network automatically adjusts how difficult this process is so that one block is generated roughly every ten minutes regardless of the processing power being used to mine.

The authentication emails have been up/down all morning. I wouldn't worry about it too much, I'm sure it will be fixed soon enough.
Note: I just tried again now and it's worked this time and yes, it's a bad idea to store coins in an online wallet, use a paper wallet instead.

You'll be lucky to make a dollar a day and that's not even considering power costs, you certainly won't be able to recover the initial hardware costs.

I've had it happen to me a number of times now over the last couple of weeks (not the password being incorrect but them simply not sending a two factor authentication) and I also got locked out the other day, it's pretty annoying but there isn't much you can do other then use a different exchange.

House always wins in the end. Of course it doesn't work. Eventually you run out of money so can't afford to keep doubling or hit some arbitrary bet limit and lose it all.
