Ooh, the crazy is *almost* charming. Anyways kids, have fun with your friendster or whatever it is. I'm sure it'll rule the world one day, I'm *sure* of it.

How is this different from throwaway-o's 'Bitcoin declaration of independence'? Or dusty's? There have been no less than ten of these 'declarations' signed by crazy libertarians, such that I feel I can't even hand out the usual title of "Dork heard 'round the world" or "First Conspiratorial Continental Congress" as I usually do. You're just too late.

Usually you can just drop the statrix bomb on someone 13 or younger without it causing too much damage. Older minds are a problem, but my assumption is that we needn't worry about that in americanpegasus' case. If he *does* somehow turn out to be older than 13, I think he has much bigger concerns than being inside the government battery farm. 
As for me, I'm proud to be the power source for Joe Biden's Volt.

Well good, maybe you can use them as MTG creature tokens or something once this is all over. In any event, a lot of people are going to be left holding the bag here...

It doesn't though. Those guys (despite being powerfully dumb) are way smarter than you. Also, no one but you will ever read it. You're declaring independence from your bedroom and your teddy bear collection at this rate.

It's true, the ones dropped in 2011 have already come to fruition and destroyed the American government as well as the banks, ushering in an era of free-keene style liberty for all the people in society with money. AmericanPegasus just doesn't know it yet because he's still plugged into the Statrix.

Any port in a storm, eh? You go on an make yourself feel happy ctrl-f'ing every page on reddit desperately searching for terms like 'mainstream', 'moon', 'taxes are theft', and 'this is gentlemen'. Whatever keeps  you warm at night atop your meager pile of Sperg Shekels. 
Meanwhile, the adults will keep things running because at the end of the day, we are a nation who have a built-in compassion and fiscal responsibility for the mentally ill, under-educated, or even dangerously unbalanced individuals within our social contract -- even for those who want to weasel out of it themselves. We have an obligation to those people and thus don't really have time to actually engage their weird apocalyptic fantasies. Good luck out there, and I hope my taxes can contribute in some tiny way to the sanitarium where you'll spend your golden years.

Happened about six months ago. Now, it's petty bickering amongst miners, true believers, and margin traders. It's beginning to look a lot like litecoin.
