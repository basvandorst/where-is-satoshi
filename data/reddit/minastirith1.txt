I shit you not that I know friends who have a colleague that is moving there to cash out his crypto coz he hit it big time after buying years ago. Like 40MM big. Fucking ridiculous. 
@_date: 2018-01-06 13:50:19
Ah yeah I was assuming this was their primary residence, but I guess at that level of money, it’ll be an investment property. But it’s only taxed on the profit they made not on the entire 1MM
@_date: 2018-01-06 11:09:06


I don't think that's accurate at all. There isn't CGT on a property sale. The CGT only applies on the BTC gains in this case. Not on the property itself or am I completely confused about the law?
@_date: 2018-01-06 03:20:54
Oh no, the inconvenience of having to pay some capital gains tax on a million dollar profit. Better not risk it.

I do not understand why they were fined. It sounds like they just made an investment sim game with optional by in via XBT. What was illegal about this?
@_date: 2015-12-31 14:02:04
Wait wait wait.... this whole time I've been given the impression that a "hard fork" means all my previous bitcoins will no longer be "valid" on this new system and if that new system caught on and the old one died off, I would essentially be starting off at zero again. Is this not the case? Then how is this different from a "soft" fork? 
Sounds like I should be a lot less worried after reading what you said. 
@_date: 2015-12-19 08:56:43
That's pretty disappointing and scammy of them. 
@_date: 2015-12-31 14:26:37
Thank you for the response. So basically no matter what happens from this apparently shitty situation, no one is going to lose any coins over it?

@_date: 2016-01-08 03:26:49
Very cool service, I haven't used it yet but I've looked through your FAQs and it looks like a very well designed and easy to use system. 
I'm just curious how you are getting revenue? This may be a tough question but if you don't charge fees and don't have ads, how does a business make money? Note I'm not having a stab at you, we all know businesses need to make money and I have no problems with that if you're providing a good service. 
I'll look forward to testing out your service shortly.
@_date: 2016-03-07 01:00:03
The rude replies that you've gotten just solidifies the fact that this sub has turned to trash. People are so bitter here that it just poisons everyone. The sub and the other coin reminds me a bit more of how things were in BTCs infancy. Shame.
@_date: 2016-03-18 13:56:11
Wow fuck I did the same thing with ETH. That limit doesn't mean anything if you are using a "fixed" exchange. I.e. Even if the rate is 1:100, if you set what you want to receive to 4, and you send 1 BTC expecting 100, you still only get 4. You ONLY send the amount they specified. 
The good news is, if you provide them with the TX ID or the address info, they will look into it and refund you if it was wrong. This is what they did in my case and refunded the 0.5 BTC extra that I mistakenly sent. Just be aware that their policy states that they don't have to refund you if you make he error, but Good luck. 
@_date: 2016-03-09 05:48:03


heh that's a new one.

@_date: 2016-01-15 02:31:49
Lol this is the first I've heard of this but sadly to say I'm not even surprised. The way these little boys are bickering, they will probably be known as the idiots that drove the first pioneering electronic transfer of value protocol into the ground over petty disagreements. Or at the very least, stagnating it's adoption. 
@_date: 2016-01-08 04:41:29
You could convert to fiat that's sent to a bank account linked with PayPal. It's a bit longer but PayPal is so shady that not many would want to risk it.
@_date: 2016-03-07 00:57:29
That other coin!
@_date: 2016-01-08 02:44:47
I just realised that you can also "pay yourself" using the pay anyone feature. I feel like the rates are very fair and saves you the hassle of going through an exchange. I personally have not tried this yet and will test it over the weekend. If someone has dealt with these guys before please comment and provide some feedback.

Wait so dollars are no longer backed by gold? What are they backed by then? The concept of trading in fiat to a bank for gold is extremely strange to me and I can't imagine it ever actually happened anywhere. 
@_date: 2016-01-07 14:09:49
Signed, would def be keen for that open free course. 
@_date: 2015-08-03 03:50:32
This sounds like a good concept but they have proved nothing and explained it pretty poorly. I am tech savvy and after reading that it just made me frustrated as it doesn't talk about how I can join up or when it's ready to use. The average person will just read it and be confused as fuck.

@_date: 2017-11-26 06:52:52
Can confirm, the network is becoming congested and sending BTC is ever increasing in fees. I hold some but it would be a disservice to ignore the elephant in the room. This issue needs to be resolved sooner than later. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 14:08:13
My biggest mistake was selling everything in one go and not holding any in reserve. Rookie mistake

@_date: 2016-02-04 00:41:20

@_date: 2016-02-07 01:42:35
But as a person with a credit card, I have absolutely no concerns of my details get hacked as if unauthorised transactions are made, that's the banks problem. Yes it's inconvenient that I have to make the effort to call up the bank and make a claim, but they cop the financial loss, not me. Is this not how most people take it?
@_date: 2016-02-16 04:32:15
The fact that you've invested this amount of money and need to ask this question here, there are only 2 conclusions we can make:
1. You are a troll. 
2. You are not very smart.

Then why even ask the question?


Yeah that sounds right /s

Lol what I don't understand is, if I didn't like something or thought someone was stupid, I would just ignore it and never think about that shit again. Let the "idiots" play in their fantasy world. But to go so far out of your way as to actively participate in their community in a negative way and to create your own sub to taunt this thing you don't agree with that has zero impact on you? Well, that's just a whole other level of sad. Can someone explain the logic to me? I am seriously confused. 
There are way better causes to devote your time to fighting, but they choose to waste their time fighting crypotocurrency. That alone speaks volumes about what kind of people they are. I find it both confusing and hilariously delicious.
Fight on my sad buttcoin brethren. Fight the good fight.

Ah this is some good perspective, thanks for the insight. Well each to their own and whatever brings you enjoyment, continue doing it. It's not harming anyone so I'm definitely not complaining either.
I own Bitcoin and have a fair amount invested as I believe in the idea behind it. Now, if it's going to succeed or not is an entirely different thing and only time will tell. I view it more as an investment that I'm not too attached to if it sinks completely. And I'm also mindful that one person believing in an idea doesn't necessarily mean it's a good idea.
@_date: 2015-04-08 10:09:09

Maybe because it had so painful truth to it :(

To the moon with you dammit.
@_date: 2015-04-17 12:16:34
Yeah good point, in that case I would speak out against it. 
That said, I am still on the fence about this whole thing. I like the idea of it but don't know if it will catch on though. And I just know how much resistance there will be. 
@_date: 2015-03-10 10:55:47

@_date: 2015-11-11 03:27:12
Hit $690 AUD last week, saw $350 AUD this morning. I'm relatively new to this whole fiasco but already I can see why some people see this as a bit of a joke. 
Although I have faith for the long run, it's starting to feel a bit like Mr. Bones' Wild Ride.
@_date: 2015-11-03 01:44:20
That's disappointing :(
Thanks for the reply I will check it out. 
Also as a side note, what is with the Australian xbt markets jumping heaps more than the US ones? Our markets surged like 5-8% per day the past few days when the US was only like 1-2%. See  makes the graphs look like the start of another bubble. 
@_date: 2015-11-27 01:12:34

Ah the original paper! Thank you 
@_date: 2015-11-03 13:28:29
What's the conversion rates like though? Coz I've noticed that a lot of these services "buy" Bitcoin at about $50 below market rate / xbt.
@_date: 2015-11-27 00:49:42
Ok seriously, how the fuck do people know all these different names for different bitcoin values to tip? I've seen so many variations that I feel like people are just making shit up and the bot just donates a random amount to the person. Or is there a massive list somewhere?
@_date: 2015-03-09 23:49:28
This was a concern of mine. Would using an escrow service decrease this risk for you?
@_date: 2015-11-03 02:20:14
Yeah sorry I meant that. And I see, that makes sense. 
@_date: 2015-11-27 05:04:57

Oh, well there we have it. That is frustrating. 
@_date: 2015-10-31 07:36:54
Wait I am not understanding the logic here. If people are getting interested, doesn't that imply that the price is going up over the long term? Why would one sell once people start talking about it? It sounds like that is the ideal time to hold for a better price. But I know nothing about economics and shares.
@_date: 2015-03-19 00:30:20
Well I was asleep when this all happened. This is what happening being in Australia. Sleep through all the action.
But thanks for the feedback, now the context makes sense. 
@_date: 2015-03-31 13:51:53
Can you link me this white paper you speak of?
@_date: 2015-03-09 23:45:49
That isn't the point. I make a very big margin on these products and I can afford to take that hit if it means bringing more awareness towards bitcoins and alternative payment options and attention AWAY from PayPal.
And what's your problem anyway? A seller selling things for cheaper should be a celebrated thing. Didn't need your shit talk thanks. 
@_date: 2015-10-28 05:45:41


Oh, when's that?
@_date: 2015-03-09 23:59:01
Ok sorry that may not have been clear in my OP. 
Making my own site is not an option at this stage unfortunately. Did you mean that eBay will actively block attempts to accept btc?
edit: apparently cryptocurrency is a banned payment method. Figures.
@_date: 2015-10-28 05:06:13
The *only* explanation.
@_date: 2015-02-26 07:49:05
Wait so in the context of this thread, are people expecting the price to drop sharply soon so they want to sell now?
@_date: 2015-03-10 03:36:15
Cryptothrift is a very good site that uses BTC  as payment. Check it out.
@_date: 2016-05-19 01:35:50

I use trezor, would that theoretically protect me? 
@_date: 2015-03-10 01:39:24
Ah yes, that's a handy idea. Maybe that would be an option. But then I'd have to build a website :(
@_date: 2017-07-12 01:34:34
This is a great app, thanks for making this. 
Just some feedback, it seemed like it took the app a few minutes to sync up upon first start up. As it wasn't showing any prices for a while when it first started and it would put any coins with value at the very bottom at first, before they got moved to the top and light up. If that makes sense.

@_date: 2015-02-25 03:39:25
Thanks for the reply, someone else suggested this approach as well. This is the first time I have heard of such an approach, I assume it is common with investors. 
From what I can tell, this approach would minimise risk in the cases where I buy it all today and the price drops 50% next week. However, I guess you also lose the benefit of say, the prices rises 50% in 2 weeks. 
The question would be, say you noticed a downward trend over the weeks, would you still keep a sustained buying cycle? Or stop purchasing completely?
Is this approached used purely to 'obtain a decent amount' of a share or something for a 'market price'? How about for those in it for the long haul? I'm not after a pump and dump as I do feel the value of use of BTC is increasing over time. But this would be 1-5 years away. 
@_date: 2015-02-25 02:03:24
I was using BTCmarkets.com.au myself for some smaller purchases as I find they have a decent volume of exchange from what I can tell. Would you recommend your site?
@_date: 2015-02-25 02:26:49
Umm if you deposit over the weekend it is in your account Tues morning. Otherwise one full day on a business day. So not exactly fast but I guess that's the standard? (I don't really know, I haven't exactly shopped around yet).
@_date: 2017-07-04 04:11:54


Holy fuck, so over these shitty ICOs. Every greedy fucker is jumping on these shitcoins and a lot of them just turn into pump and dump schemes, which in turn damage the entire crypto ecosystem and reputation.
And I thought ETH was already ASIC resistant? That is why there's such a GPU shortage
@_date: 2015-02-25 04:50:30

@_date: 2015-02-26 12:29:23
Excellent explanation, my lack of knowledge in finance matters is really coming to bite me in the ass as I look into investing into BTC.
Just bought a few BTC tonight and I'm now pretty excited about it. Just got to work out this cold storage business...
@_date: 2015-02-25 03:53:37
There's is just so much choice that I feel overwhelmed. But the fact that one a few of them accept Aus deposits and AUD makes it easier I guess. 
And you're right, I think BTC is the one to go with for the foreseeable future. Thanks again.
@_date: 2015-02-25 04:24:00
Coin Spot seems to have low volumes of trading, or do I have that wrong? 
I've been using BTCmarkets, they seem to be okay, but I will give coinspot another go.

I don't think anyone realistically expects it to be infinite.

I had no idea about all these possibilities and I would say hat I have delved into bitcoins far more than the average joe. This is shocking and disappointing.

I am new around here, would you care to explain to me what a node is and why they only last a month and what is the point of this experiment?
I only recently go into bitcoins and am kicking myself for not getting into it earlier.

This is true I'm actually checking the markets everyday and delving deeper into it slowly. As opposed to not giving a shit about anything finance at all previously.

This is so over my head it isn't even embarrassing any more. 
Can you let me know what program this is in? I'm just very curious that is all. Also how much was the prize worth?
@_date: 2015-02-26 07:48:04
Ah yes that's a rather negative strategy to use, makes sense now though.

Their fees are so low compared to what I have been using. Fuck me, I need to jump ship immediately.

I read into this method and it seems only small markets can be affected by this technique. I thought XBT had decent market cap?
@_date: 2015-02-28 13:23:39
I just checked out your site and your trading fees are substantially lower than other sites I have been using. Fuck sake, jumping ship immediately. 
@_date: 2015-02-28 13:15:58
Umm can you answer the question? I actually would like to know. 
@_date: 2015-02-25 02:04:34
I don't have any investing experience, this would be my first and only "investment" I'd say.
@_date: 2015-02-25 04:49:34
Thanks for that, I will be looking into how to do that later tonight. If you have any links to guides that would be appreciated to.
I have been making the mistake of keeping BTC in wallets online/exchanges. Given it is only a few hundred$ worth so far so not that vital, but yes, need to look into more secure methods.

A sustained bubble or another one that bursts? I am frustrated that most people see BTC as a pump and dump scheme. There are some great applications for it but I think the problem right now is most investors see it as a rich quick scheme :(

What is this fair value calculator you speak of? Is it a price prediction app?
@_date: 2015-02-26 07:10:36
Can you explain what shorts mean? People are using it everywhere ITT and I'm very lost.

There are plenty of other banks that will work fine with BTC. Why the fuck do you have to choose one of the most scummy banks of them all? Don't support those cunts by storing your money there. 
@_date: 2017-06-11 15:54:05
Keep sucking off the banks cock you shill

Good points, noted. Thanks for the link.

My only rationale was that DarkCoins provide the privacy and un-traceability that BTC kind of lacks at the moment and this might be a niche that picks up. 
Don't know much about LTC, isn't it just a copy of BTC, but with a faster 'hash rate' or something, which makes the transactions faster? Yeah, I don't know anything about LTC.
