no because as an outsider you would see a bunch of transaction that specified a 'i want to remain anonymous' script. knowing something is anonymous isnt worse.
sufficiently anonymized could be some measure of mixing and how the money is split into other addresses over time.
@_date: 2014-01-14 19:00:44
the way i see it a payee might just end up transferring from Q' into a storage address - it wouldn't be particularly hard to unpick that.

just added a longer explanation below...
@_date: 2014-01-13 10:19:25
ah you mean so you can scan as soon as it opens? that's just a matter of opening into another acitivity. The nice thing about the NFC intents is you don't need the app open when you tap to the terminal (y)

@_date: 2014-01-12 19:11:42
Hey jav - that's pretty cool. I got something similar working recently allowing you to scan products with your phone and retrieve a price from the merchant's terminal - check it out: 
@_date: 2014-01-12 19:02:30
Did this for my 4th year engineering project last year and thought ya'll might like to see.
A little bit more about the project:
Pre-KitKat - making the NFC comms rather challenging...
Currently implemented as a 99p store - but the 'checkout' sends the price to the phone along with an address to pay to.
@_date: 2014-01-14 18:59:32
Does this do anything to stop the payee from just transferring all the transactions onward into a common address, thus still making the transaction trackable?
edit: Here's a better thought! I saw a talk a while ago that spoke about bitcoin's escrow capabilities (as yet, underdeveloped features of bitcoin) - for it to release funds in transactions based on something digitally provable. What if you could specify an algorithm that identified "insufficiently anonymized coins". You could use this as part of a *reverse* transaction that you set up. I.e. you are guaranteed a refund if the person you are paying doesn't take sufficient precautions to anonymize your money.
@_date: 2014-01-14 19:10:19


they just have to hunt it out - its in the transaction information. (as they have to hunt out and check transactions to their address currently)
@_date: 2014-01-13 10:19:37
still working for me in an incognito tab...
@_date: 2014-01-12 20:18:49
A longer explanation. First off - the project uses the ZXing library to scan products and remembers the barcodes. On touching the phone to the NFC terminal - the barcodes are sent over and the terminal can calculate the total from it's product database and send it back to the phone, along with a bitcoin address. The app then opens the bitcoin app to do the payment.
As I've shown it, the terminal has not database so just counts the barcodes and acts as a 99p store...
The challenging part of this was the underlying library I wrote that allowed the transfer of information both directions over NFC - the pre-kitkat android API was very limited.

@_date: 2013-03-28 02:51:28
Right so how are you going to replace the transactions you do in your debit card day to day. You don't keep that amount in your wallet right? Also, replenishing the wallet is pretty important to this discussion IMO. Debit cards are so convenient in their ability to let you access your funds. You could think of the price you pay to be this cost of this convenience rather than a cost of others being subject to fraud.
Your saying you want to escape the system sort of proves my point that most people won't be as enthusiastic about this as you...

good point (the first part). I suppose it depends on how likely you think it is that your savings will be inflated away, I certainly dont suspect it. equally, bitcoin could be hit by external market forces and devalue, either way seems a gamble.


yes, an international, cash-in-hand equivalent is a good argument too. opinion now shifting back to holding onto my bitcoins long run :)

im aware of what hyperinflation is to a school level of what happened in germany etc and understand it to be caused by excessive money printing. what i was referring to was that bitcoins don't inflate, so you cant get that magic 2-5% inflation rate.
@_date: 2013-03-28 01:26:03
right, this is where things go over my head - I'm a techy and so tend to think of thetechnical reasons things may or may not work. from a simplistic economic standpoint, does not some level of inflation encourage spending and help the economy?
@_date: 2013-03-28 10:41:05
point is a debit card doesn't require "fund replenishing" as it accesses a store of a lot of money - the kind of money you probably would not store on a hardware wallet.
and lay people just ask "but what's the advantage over a debit card? that's easy and I'm sure they already make it pretty safe" and suddenly all the arguments about encrypted key storage go away. I already have a hardware wallet - a debit card? sorry to be the antagonist here but I feel that challenging bitcoin and coming through with really solid arguments is important. This is something i realised when I enthusiastically told my friend about them and he came back with the "but payments are already easy" line which basically stumped me.
i'm more inclined to agree with other arguments here about bitcoin not being a replacement for day-to-day currency but for other things (im still trying to nail a few of those down solid in my mind)

Right now the suggestion is still on the [9th page of the most popular suggestions list]( to get to the top spot we'll need over 30,000 votes, but we should certainly get some attention from here from the dropbox team. Keep voting though, more votes mean more people interested in spending money with them via BTC!

"we dont want to take the risk of having to test it all again, make it work by making the least changes possible"

yes agreed about the backup vs insurance thing - you jumped to the same conclusion i did about convenience vs cost. Don't forget we're still talking about lay people here :)
re: change/anonimity, that is true but merchants can get an idea of the scales of money you move around. if one of the addresses used in the payment were your top-up address, they might be looking at a log of the money you put in your wallet every week. also, throw a loyalty card into the mix and suddenly they can tie separate transactions together. we need a mixing service. we need a bank?
@_date: 2013-03-28 01:34:41

let's talk about the 4 you have listed:
international payments: bitcoin is cheaper, but with a more international sociey will the cost of conventional currency transfers decrease? and will the costs involved in moving in and out of bitcoin increase? if bitcoin brings some competition to the market and decreases the price then great! but does this guarantee bitcoin as the chosen international transfer currency? not so sure...
savings accounts: assuming bitcoin having a roughly stable value, what advantage does this have over a fiat currency savings account?
currency trading: not sure how this is too different from international payments.
black market: less black market = better as far as im concerned. for it to be viable for other kinds of investment and people to get involved in it, we need more regulation. (there was a recent law passed about bitcoin and money laundering in the US right? if i'm not mistaken this was considered a good thing)
i suppose im focusing on bitcoin in retail etc as this is where adoption by te lay-man lies. Isn't that, to an extent, what gives a currency it's credibility and what makes people want to trade/save in it in the first place?
@_date: 2013-03-26 16:26:23
maybe its a uk thing, but I dont use a credit card, I pay debit for most highstreet transactions - charges are far less nasty.
what if that thing you want to buy is a quick coffee on the way home? do i really need to consider it twice? 10+ minutes to get funds from bank to phone then 10+ minutes to get funds to the store. (assuming 1 level confirmation is enough for the store?)
you are right about people carrying smart phones, which was why i mentioned google wallet.
and your first point about QR code is valid if you have the funds on your smartphone.... round we go again....

Just a reminder that your votes have reset!
So, I posted this up nearly 2 months ago and got a great response from Reddit first time round. We got a good chunk of votes and move up the ranks in the pages a bit. I was pretty happy and figured we'd slowly make our was up the rankings from there.
I've been super busy the last month with uni finals and when I checked today I was astonished! It seems the idea was reposted by a few others and received a similar response each time. Good work everyone!
But there's still a long way to go. For DropBox to take this seriously, I think we need to not only hit the top spot on their ideas page, but we need to get the OVERKILL and sit a good way above that top vote spot of ~180k votes. Let's do this Reddit!
@_date: 2013-03-28 01:14:08
Great reply, thanks! You seem to have a realistic view on things...
So, to sort of delve into your response a bit - your first paragraph roughly says "replacement for person - person transfers" - ie paypal replacement. i'm now wondering what the value of this market is and if/when we-will hit that. i still think services like paypal/google wallet could be providing this before too long.
travelling - I'm sort of hopeful that with more and more travel and more global services we'll see more reductions in the costs of spending abroad
Storing money in Bitcoin would require stability. So I suppose depends on previous points. if its not a huge market it might remain unstable. also this is a pretty niche use.
thanks again for your reply.
@_date: 2013-04-18 21:50:40
Ah. Good point. I'm not sure about that. I think some people have mentioned issues with that. Have you tried??
@_date: 2013-04-13 15:10:06
they actually did have some level of automation, using jenkins. albeit not enough to do a full automated test.
thing is they had to test it all *anyway* to check the changes worked.
its strange, i thought i would love working at smaller companies, but the lack of expertise (or rather, some incredibly good expertise in only a few areas) meant that i couldnt really get anyone on my side or talk to someone who used an android phone. rushing an android implementation does not mean android is buggy or dangerous or insecure. it means you didnt read the documentation and work out that 9 patch images are a good idea... /rant
on the other hand, in a big company with lots of experts, you are *more* likely to have someone critique what you have done and get it done *right*. there's also always going to be "that guy in germany" who knows the bit of code you are fiddling with inside out.
@_date: 2013-03-26 19:25:08
right. thats summarizes it quite nicely :)
so do you think there would even be adoption if people wound up looking for 3rd parties to do the work for them and realised the existing system is pretty much just that? one of the only advantages i see is its a universal currency but why not the already established USD market?
is bitcoin more a way for banks to improve the way your money is transferred *rather* than a way for us to manage our money?
are we going to end up relying on a few, large, well connected, trusted nodes on the network?
@_date: 2013-03-26 23:29:47

@_date: 2013-03-28 02:11:31
sure, so I had a similar dialogue with someone about this, which went along the lines of:
store a smaller wallet on the phone
how much do you store?
enough for spending
how much is that?
you set the ammount for your usage
thats potentially worth a lot so people might steal it (equiv or a wad of cash)
so back it up and get to it before the criminal
what if you dont? wont lay people want some kind of insurance?
yes, i guess it's convenience vs cost.
ie the lay people would choose not to have the faff of carrying their bitcoinc round with them for day to day purchases. much better to have a bank back you up if you get your stuff stolen.

edit: correction. i do not get 9 votes per month (i get 1) see 'decimal's comment below.

OK I was mistaken in that part. I made some small but not &lt; 0.01btc transactions
I suppose I was calling bullshit on the implication that pixelpaws was making that paying the fee to have your tax go through in under a few hours is only necessary below 0.01

fair enough, client side encryption for you then...
i use the service for its convenience in backing up and sharing and I'm not too concerned with their decryption ability. Law enforcement could more easily seize my laptop. My laptop could more easily be hacked, etc etc.
I place trust in Dropbox not to mess with my data, just as I trust them to back it up. I imagine there are VERY strict internal measures to prevent someone from just poking around your data if they felt like it.

does transferwise work from e.g. bitstamp?
@_date: 2013-03-28 02:24:19
and what if you don't have enough time? or don't realise it's stolen? or get held at gunpoint?

and when i start buying fuel with BTC? with that I could get over £100 no problem. (note: this is the plural 'i' which includes laypeople). As the amount goes up, I suddenly feel the urge to have someone backing me up if my phone get's compromised. It seems to me almost every difficulty winds up with banks again.
another example on a slight tangent: what about anonymity and mixing services - do they not also approach a bank as things scale? without mixing services it's not particularly difficult for a merchant to get a good look at what's going on in my funds even if i take the precaution of standing at the counter for 10/20 minutes and moving £3.66 for my starbucks to a separate address

nuttin controversial yet. just some guy who agreed with me
@_date: 2013-04-12 19:55:52
Remember that guy who got kicked out of an investment brainstorming meeting in some financial company for mentioning Bitcoin? I'd love to be a fly on the walll in his office in the coming months
@_date: 2013-03-28 13:44:59
perhaps, I would argue that we have what we have for a reason.
@_date: 2013-04-06 11:30:18
is it worth also mentioning the possibility of pools collaborating? this is a dimension that doesn't really seem to get much attention
@_date: 2013-03-28 02:55:27
Also I haven't made up my mind. Still very open to changing my current take on bitcoin, just stating what my *current* opinion is based on the knowledge and discussion I've had.
@_date: 2013-04-21 00:47:12
If I turn my head sideways his 3rd graph looks sort of similar to his first. Just with a different time scale. If the "attacker" followed the same strategy he would have still made money
@_date: 2013-04-06 17:45:25
bitcoin's security is enhance by more computers mining. the rewards of mining are an incentive for people to contribute their computer's power
@_date: 2013-04-09 09:40:16
Not too shabby...
@_date: 2013-03-26 17:35:33
thats not the comparison being made. As I said in my first post, why not use a regular, fiat currency VISA debit card - its easier
@_date: 2013-04-08 19:14:41
don't they have to be able to decrypt the data to provide the service to users?
it sounds like they are just being clear/open about what would happen in this situation. what if google got served with a similar warrant?
@_date: 2013-03-28 00:49:10
right, so how do you get your coffee in under 10 minutes? how do you prove to the guy on the counter the cash is on the way without providing a transaction history that leads back to your accounts?
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:32:27
dude, at my university there are a set number of 1sts, 2.i, 2.ii, 3rd per module to get, all based on statistics, even down to the small class sizes we have this year. its all done competitively!
@_date: 2013-04-05 19:30:18
Wow! So refreshing to see over the brainfarting that has been so many reports on Bitcoin from the likes of CNBC. America, you have slightly redeemed yourself today. Sincerely, the UK.
@_date: 2013-04-12 06:57:32
haha i managed break even and decrease my exposure somewhat. i havent got much invested anyway :)
@_date: 2013-04-16 07:50:07
What I like about NFC is that its basically gesture based - you reach out and tap the things you want to interact with. NFC also gives you a 2-way channel that a qr code doesn't (granted, qr and NFC could both be used to just set up a Bluetooth link, but for small data transfers this is totally unnecessary)
@_date: 2013-03-26 17:45:04
yes, i'm currently using this wallet app. but yea it doesnt seem to lock the wallet which is a bit worrying at the minute.
you'd want to be pretty quick to sort it out if you lost your phone. if they got to the priv key first, you've no way of getting the money back without a bank to back you up.
@_date: 2013-04-16 07:31:00
THANKYOU! I've been saying this for ages and keep getting shot down. My friend is convinced that by using bit coin more, you wallet would become self anonymising/mixing but with a few transactions that you know are from the same wallet you can get some idea of the wealth of an individual (statistical connection to different value nodes).
It seems like it took the bubble breaking for it to be OK to for any criticism or realistic valuation in this subbreddit.

so much this

@_date: 2013-03-28 01:39:07
sorry, i mean that if i transfer to you with bitcoins vs debit card or bank transfer there is a difference in what you see. with bitcoins you can follow the blockchain back and probably get a good look at what i've been doing, especially if i've managed my wallets badly
@_date: 2013-03-26 16:33:36
so you have all your bitcoins stored on your phone?
@_date: 2013-04-13 15:22:24
the first guy with "secret" as his password is gonna wonder whats going on....
@_date: 2013-03-28 01:30:27
agreed, as said, I'm not averse to profit ;)
@_date: 2013-04-08 16:23:01
Do people think it would be worth putting up a reminder of this in one month time when vote counters have reset?

mixing services seem to converge to "bank" again...
ive just started a new thread on this: 
@_date: 2013-04-08 19:32:58
in order to be able to provide the service they provide, they have to be able to decrypt your data.
if you choose to share with others then they have to be able to decrypt it to share it with them for you.
@_date: 2013-03-26 22:50:04
yes. have been playing with them a bit and will consider using them to purchase good but wondering about the practicalities of them becoming commonly used.

haha OK, fair play. the "Harlem Shake" article was particularly bad.
