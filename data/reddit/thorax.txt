So... let's say the NASDAQ shuts down. Does this mean stocks suddenly are on the verge of collapse?
No, it means a major exchange shut down-- but there are plenty more exchanges. Sure, it will raise concerns about accountability for other exchanges, but there's no "collapsing" in sight.

The word "officially" -- it means something different than the way you use it. Even if mtgox really is dead, it's anything but official. 
Right now, we have no **official** word at all about its demise-- the most recent official statement from them is that they are "protecting" the site and users with their downtime.
We're all lamenting lack of "official" clarification.

I see a working support page. What do you mean?
@_date: 2014-02-25 18:19:20
They are officially in this state: "a decision was taken to close all transactions for the time being".
No one with complete power over their future (owners or government, for example) has said they are dead officially. You could say they are officially in a coma, I suppose. But their true demise is anything but 'official' yet. Officially they hint at this being a temporary situation... even "a turning point". 
Treat it as unofficially dead, but **by definition** it's not official just because someone without authority on the internet declares it so.

For one, because it is easier to conduct a transaction in BTC and you don't have to provide your personal information (and potentially stealable CC in order to make it happen. If you obtained BTC for USD initially, you can do it again as you please (even immediately) so that you can conduct a transaction in BTC without putting your identity on the line, risking only your transaction investment and *nothing else* to make an online purchase.

Here's my write-up on the topic-- 
@_date: 2011-06-03 19:39:49
You saw this? 
All along with this spike, you'd have been better off buying bitcoins from someone than mining. I don't think that changes going forward unless it dips a lot.
The risk is less with mining because in the end you have hardware to show even if BTC implodes, but the upside for investing directly in currency has so far been better return.
@_date: 2011-06-03 20:36:50
Awww, come on. This kind of statement is what makes people think the currency is some big speculation or pyramid scheme. Bitcoin is not a get-rich-quick scheme and there's surely going to be some major hurdles that send it plummeting. You don't get this kind of volatility without major risk.
Also, I really would like to see it eventually be used as a currency rather than the wild roller coaster.
@_date: 2011-06-14 15:10:11

I hesitate to believe the degrees bit, or you wouldn't be so incensed and still holding onto Bitcoins at the same time. 
Yes it's a bubble, but not all "bubbles" burst. Even if it does, though, people are by in large investing money they can afford to lose into an idea they want to see succeed.
The idea that somehow this bubble could be worse than the subprime mortage madness (which leaves people actually homeless) is ridiculous, and I can't fathom there's any one of your college professors that would equate the two in any way at all.

Sell if you're using it as a speculative investment. You've 15x'd your money and you can call it a day and be quite happy. Probably one of the best short-term investments in terms of %returns you'll ever make without another windfall.
There's no risk whatsoever if you cash out now and then you've won. Let someone else take the risk.
That being said, if you're wanting to have some of this currency to use when it stabilizes, and are looking to support it as a currency because you like it, keep them so you can spend them that way. Just don't be shocked when the (first) Great Bitcoin Shock comes and it's back down to &lt;$1 a piece.
TLDR: Short-term investor should sell and take their certain winnings, long-term supporters should stay in and just be happy they have some to use. Also, use your own judgement.

If I understand it, it's really just a virtual currency that has a built-in way to spend the currency. So in essence it's bitcoin but with another thing (virtual real estate purchases) adding to the value of it.

You have a wallet that contains multiple addresses (and will contain more, probably). You can pick one of these receiving addresses and make it your default one, if you want. Any of those addresses will show up in this wallet, so you can give out any one you want and they'll all work to get to your wallet.

One note, though-- gold and silver can lose a lot of value, but they're wildly unlikely to become worthless junk unless we discover they cause cancer or something. Even then they still have industrial uses that will give them value due to rarity.
Bitcoins on the otherhand have a number of failure scenarios where it becomes entirely worthless.

That client change was poorly thought out, which makes me worry about Bitcoin's future. The tech lead has so many bitcoins it never occurred to him that people would want to legitimately send small amounts of them. This shook my faith in the entire network that (a) this was the hack they picked to try to fight tiny transactions and (b) that the solution is so poorly formed for a depreciating currency requiring a client update to fix it. Spamming should be reducible in other ways than something like this which is simply not future proof.
I kept the old client which has no such limitation for sending low items, but then they may take forever to get verified.

This will keep the speculators out of the exchanges in the short-term, but it doesn't matter exactly who holds the bitcoins (I never knew that anyway), as long as I have mine. 
I'm more interested in the currency and participating than making a quick buck.
From a purely economic standpoint, even if some random hacker now has 500k bitcoins, why would I believe they wouldn't also want to maximize their portfolio over the long haul? If they are a rational economic actor then you don't really have anything to fear from their behavior. If they are an idealist bent on destroying Bitcoin then that's another matter, but I think it's just peeps wanting money.
Eventually more secure exchanges will exist or it will be primarily OTC and decentralized. Either way, bitcoin isn't going away until a core technical problem is found, really.
I promise though, that if an exchange opens at bitcoins below a buck, I'm buying plenty. :)
@_date: 2011-06-04 20:37:08

Are you trolling? Because ultimate security is not possible in any situation.
The whole art of security is about increasing the difficulty to prevent bad guys from ruining your day. No real-world safe is immune to cracking, stealing, or destroying. No casino vault is immune to being emptied. No password is immune to being cracked or being lost to social engineering. 
To create security, you design barriers, layer by layer, between you and the black hats. 
Sure some mechanisms are better than others, but any solution that removes or severely weakens attack vectors is absolutely improving security. There's a return on investment analysis required, as always, but we have to begin putting up real barriers to make Bitcoin acceptable for mainstream usage.
If your point is that people need to still understand that their wallet could very easily be stolen, then great. Make that point. That's absolutely true. BUT there's no denying that encrypting the wallet creates a very solid barrier against many attack vectors today-- even against real world physical stealing of your USB drive or laptop.
Is it enough to secure your wallet from someone determined? Nope. Advanced attacks will always win. But that doesn't mean we shouldn't prevent simple attacks, petty thievery, dropbox downloads, etc, from also getting your wallet.

Do you not understand? The kind of power they wield could undermine the vast majority of faith in the entire system, potentially crashing the market and destroying the value of your bitcoins. 
The amount of fakery someone can cause may never be repaired and there will be all sorts of difficulty figuring out what transactions were legit and which ones weren't. And with someone with the deep BTC pockets that deepbit has, it's crazy the kind of mess that can happen. 
He can pretty much freeze the entire economy. Whenever it happens for the first time, it's going to undermine all faith people have. Don't willfully cause the system to have weaknesses.

@_date: 2011-05-29 20:30:34
Here are a couple different approaches to take to help you explain it (conversationally). Feel free to mix and match them.
**If she knows Skype (my grandmother does):**
You know how Skype lets us call people far away over the computer without paying the phone company to do it? Imagine if you could do the same with transferring money-- just send money over the computer without needing to involve a bank, Western Union, Visa, the government and without having to provide any personal information whatsoever.
Well, Bitcoin is actually a clever technique to do that. It works like Skype in that computers talk to one another over the internet to arrange the transfer. It can't use government dollars, though, (like US dollars or Euros) to send over the internet, because there are lots of rules and regulations for those. So it uses special digital coins. Out there in the world, thousands of computers run by people like me and you and Billy down the street-- those computers all work together to verify that the (airquotes) "coins" we want to send to people actually get to them and that no one tries to counterfeit any money. 
To send the coins, we just type in the other person's Bitcoin account number and the coins are sent to him almost like it was cash-- no bank or credit card or personal information required. And it happens within minutes, so it's a lot faster and safer than trying to mail people paper money.
My friends and I are super excited about this like we were seven years ago when we started using Skype when it came out. Just like Skype changed the game so you didn't have to go register and pay a phone company to make calls, this does the same thing by cutting banks out of the money transfer process. People are currently so excited about this that they're buying a whole lot of these bitcoins so they can use them for easy transfer of money over the internet. 
**If she doesn't know Skype:**
You know how governments create types of money/currencies and call them the "euro" or the "dollar" and then they put their governments behind it?
Well, there's a new type of computer (airquotes) "coin" that people are starting to use as money. Instead of governments endorsing it, though-- the coins are calculated by thousands of normal computers across the world. (And I'm talking about people like you and me, their computers-- not big government or bank computers.) It's truly a currency "of the people" that uses some brilliant math and our computers to ensure no one can make a counterfeit coin, no matter how hard they try.
People love it because you don't have to register your name and number with Visa or with a bank or with the government to send money to people far away. It's like mailing people cash, but using the internet instead. In a way, it's kinda like an anonymous Swiss bank account where you just need to know a special account number to send money to someone. No bank or Paypal or government gets involved and it's very fast.
I'm excited about it because it changes how people buy and sell things over the computer. You don't need to sign your life away to get a credit card just to buy things on the computer.

@_date: 2011-06-09 16:45:56
Oh, I could make a loooong list of how fallible it is. It's also quite likely a speculative bubble that very well could burst at any moment. No one should be investing anything they aren't willing to see lost completely.
That being said, there are many people very excited about the new potential of electronic currencies, *especially* if they're not controlled by governments. Ideals like that *do* have value-- the same kind of value and spirit that goes into setting up governments in the first place. The "will of the people" creates and changes governments, so in some ways you could argue that as a greater (if more diffuse) power than the government's power to create fiat money and enforce its use.
Right now the ideals do give it a central core value, to the point that many people would be willing to support it even after a crash (assuming it technically stands up to the test of time). 
I don't like so many people speculating on it because it creates points of views like yours making both sides look hysterical. I think the gold-rushers and the haters are just countering themselves. In the end hopefully people realize the idea has lots of merit, but not enough to be mortgaging your house to invest in it..

I think this fall happened after most people had their Dwolla transactions sorted out. Might have been more that when people (or a few major holders) saw Dwolla worked, they decided to cash some out.

This is pretty durned simple:
@_date: 2011-05-24 20:43:08
Not out of frustration, just trying to educate people before they learn the hard way.
@_date: 2011-06-08 20:19:40
We could setup a bounty, perhaps?
@_date: 2011-05-19 20:32:58
Yeah, love the idea. Bounties are a great way to make progress in the community. 
The best video from weusecoins.com was from a bounty project:
@_date: 2011-05-20 05:12:57
Lots of great suggestions. I like rusty's 2nd link there.
@_date: 2011-06-14 14:42:45
I want to see a 99designs for bitcoin.
@_date: 2011-06-01 02:32:36
Yeah, not quite sure what that is about...?
@_date: 2011-05-17 04:42:04
You can also sell things or services for bitcoin. Mine bitcoin, etc. As mentioned, it's a big hassle to try to buy bitcoin right now unless you can get money into Dwolla or Liberty Reserve easily.
There are some people doing Paypal -&gt; Liberty Reserve exchanges over on exchangezone.com, but I've not tried that.

So far this is my favorite. But it will lead down the path of having to have another bounty for CSS styling :)
@_date: 2011-05-24 01:55:50
I liked yours best, sorry you didn't win! 
@_date: 2011-06-20 18:09:01


Come on, you've just described every non-techy on the planet. Not just "idiots".
@_date: 2011-06-17 14:50:37
Much better to use a secondary savings account entirely for this purpose. Copying the file around makes it way too easy to either (a) deleting the file improperly or (b) leaving a copy somewhere you don't want.
@_date: 2011-06-28 03:00:54
What's it worth? Come on-- this is supposed to be a currency. It's worth its weight in bitcoins.
@_date: 2011-05-18 02:05:07
You might try over in  and see what people can do for you.
@_date: 2011-05-19 13:22:34
As a capitalist I think it should be done by votes according to the shares of those donating. :)  (but I don't care really)
@_date: 2011-06-03 17:31:57
All I know is that the guy who cashed his life savings into Bitcoins is suddenly very happy today. He could walk away with a great deal of money--- I'm worried about all the speculation, though. Maybe we need a big correction to get over the hype cycle?
@_date: 2011-06-15 22:33:24
Right-- but in the U.S.... what big boys are people using?
@_date: 2011-06-14 14:09:45
If I understand correctly, he's speaking with In-Q-Tel which is a venture capital group, whose job is to look into and invest in new technologies.  
@_date: 2011-06-09 04:13:03
Not much-- the overall income should be the same, but it will be higher at a pool with no fees.
@_date: 2011-06-28 22:38:26
Yeah, though, it will help the entire Bitcoin community if it also appeared to be a bargain compared to other currency merchant fees. Note that the belief is the overall cost for bitcoin transaction management is less than that for plugging into the existing merchant fee and Paypal world.
The 5% number will definitely pull in competitors into the market that will undercharge given it's possible to do this over a couple of weeks of development work. Why not just scare them away with "Free but probably 3%" so they have to think a lot harder about trying to provide the same service?
@_date: 2011-05-24 01:49:30
It's not known by everyone, so making sure it is.
Do you have more details on what's improving here? 
@_date: 2011-05-23 14:21:45
2BTC sent, congrats.
@_date: 2011-06-09 16:04:14
He did edit his post, see the bottom of it. He didn't directly delete the wording in the original, though.
@_date: 2011-06-10 16:52:17
A bunch, and I don't intend to "sell". I'm going to spend them on (legal) goods and services and encourage others to do so as well.
@_date: 2011-06-06 16:11:00
"cheaper and more widely accepted"
How would you do that? That's the whole question here. Yes, they'll use it if it's cheaper (??) and more widely accepted. 
The question is how do you get it to be more widely accepted...
@_date: 2011-06-01 02:03:52
Oh-- I thought this would be a question on how to calculate interest rates on a deflation-likely currency, and whether or not people would actually make loans with such a currency.
@_date: 2011-05-21 04:53:39
Circulation limit does not necessarily equate to deflation. Bitcoin has a built-in maximum limit for the amount of currency circulating, but deflation cares about the actual value people place on it and not strictly on the circulation/supply.
Yes, the money supply is an important factor, but it is not the sole driving factor for inflation or deflation. It's just one of many pressures acting on the currency's value. For example, as there are more competing currencies, worries, etc, the perceived value can change independent of the actual supply. If people truly see that the money is being hoarded, new merchants will avoid the currency in favor of others, thus lowering its value for transactions, thus requiring people to spend it in order to avoid their wealth losing value when people start dodging the currency. A wildly overpriced currency is a danger to all of its actual value and it absolutely should compel hoarders to bail before it implodes (thus loosening and spreading the wealth). I think we're seeing that currently with the latest prices.
It's actually an interesting experimental blend that is far more subtle and far harder to predict how it will behave long-term, though.
TLDR: Adding *deflationary pressure* to a currency is not the same thing as guaranteeing the currency will always deflate. Many more factors control the actual value that people will place on the currency day-to-day.

TBH, weary could have worked if you were tired of hearing about this topic. :) Also, this is a mistake made by zillions of people with English as their native tongue, so ignore the pedantry-- you don't deserve it.

What's wrong with the Reddit pool, Mt Red? 
@_date: 2011-06-03 17:26:20
By far.

Fourthed, the second link is too good.
@_date: 2013-02-22 02:33:52
It could be paid as a percentage of their bitcoin donations, which would free them from having to worry about converting it.
@_date: 2013-02-22 18:22:36
Does that mean if GoDaddy started accepting Bitcoins we'd have to continue to boycott them?
@_date: 2013-02-11 19:46:43
Welcome to the new readers.
Yet, as much as I'm happy about the exposure, this feels like yet another hype period fueled by the growth in Bitcoin value. The rampant increase in Bitcoin's value does not encourage its use as an actual currency for day-to-day transactions.
Stability &gt; Speculative Investment for Bitcoin's future. We don't need more major boom and bust cycles to keep Bitcoin chugging along.
@_date: 2013-02-14 16:33:14
The hats don't require too much tending. Some have amassed flies and caught on fire, though-- so maybe I should watch after them more often. :)
I'm a Bitcoin fan for the past couple of years-- virtual (or non-physical) currencies are really exciting to geeks like me. :)

In fact, it's through efforts of people like him that Bitcoin made it this far. There's a possibility that we wouldn't be where we are if he hadn't bought that pizza and inspired others with the story...
@_date: 2013-05-19 07:52:22
This all neglects the fact that Bitcoin evolves-- if the majority of the community recognizes and sees a major problem, they can all work together with adjustments to fix the issue. They all have a vested interest in keeping it ahead of threats like these. All of these issues listed take time to materialize and can be mitigated in different ways. 
I'd be more worried about a sudden security flaw than I am about any of these slower concerns. Bitcoin doesn't operate mindlessly in a vacuum without any human intervention possible.
Note that if quantum computing finds a way to break major cryptography/hashing approaches we use today, we have some worldwide adjustments to make. It will be a problem the entire world will be dealing with and not just Bitcoin.

Fun fact: I've bought and sold Unusual Hats with Bitcoin. 
I crossed the streams, I'm sorry.
