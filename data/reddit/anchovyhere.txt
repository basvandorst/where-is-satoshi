I have Bank of America and they haven’t said anything to me...yet. If they do I will cancel my account with them. 12 years with them drop em like a hat. Don’t tell me how to spend MY money.

As someone who also doesn’t shut up about BTC and crytpo currency I sometimes get why people want to rub in your face when it’s going south.

Thanks for the quick response! A fellow redditor aided me in setting up a touch bar widget on my laptop and I wanted to say thanks. Just wanted to be as safe as possible. I think an exchange would make most sense. Thank you!

Okay I’ve got it to display how yours is, however can I view other coins? I’ve noticed your line 7 in the advance settings code  ticker is from bitrex on your Altcoins (don’t know anything past this or if I’m on the right trail) do I need to create a different one in order to view different coins?

That is how it turns out when my family starts bringing it up. Mother asks me questions through the phone time to time, much easier to talk about.

If I want to send someone a donation using bitcoin or Coinbase more so as the platform is it secure to give to a random stranger? I am worried of random people (atm) seeing my wallet and tracking me or attempt to. Am I paranoid?

Can you give us some examples of some companies that this happened to?

Well if he holds all his money or most of his money...ahem scratch that a percentage of his money in BTC and doesn’t want to invest in other crypto-currencies, then if we all begin to migrate or believe before he does might that mitigate his control over digital currency? Just my two cents...
