Might not be ironic. This backs up my theory that btc was in fact created by powerful Western governments

Perhaps after bitcoin's tenure as reserve currency we will advance to a societal structure that doesn't require the existance of money.
One can dream.

They're still millionaires though. In doge.

It's fucking crazy that people actually donate money to wealthy people who are getting bankrolled by even wealthier people.

JP and Rubin are tools of billionaires used for social engineering. In some cases, like when it comes to right-wing social engineering and white supremacy, I think it's not wrong for a private company to decide to cut ties. These cries of 'but muh free speech' are totally ignorant of the background and context of criticism against JP and his lapdog and their masters

Why are people making donations to a successful capitalist? This guy has made millions of dollars from a best selling book and high priced lecture tours, amongst other things.
Do these people also make donations to other millionaire capitalists who already have enough to live lavishly?
Christ, that grand in donations could have fed alot of poor people who actually fucking need it.
