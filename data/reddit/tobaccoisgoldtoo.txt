Copy paste: 
"Hi, I was reading this book this morning: 
In page 5 author writes "another was a graduate student/computer hacker/CEO of a computer company that had invented a new form of Internet money". 
This was in Green College, Oxford, UK around 2006-2007 so the time checks out.
Pretty sure that we are talking about Satoshi Nakamoto here."

So if there only was one miner, the electricity consumed for bitcoin-mining, would be down to electricity for one PC?

Scroll down a bit, to get the recommended fee.

When googling on subject, there were was a bunch of companies 2002-2007 in china, developing different "webcoins".

Bitcoin will still have the same function, even if btc is down to $1000. Transactions would be faster and cheaper as well, so it is the flying pigs who wants more that crash, not the average person. Also btc-gambling-sites would become even more appealing, and the faucets and tipping and donating become much better. Stock-investors and futures = bye bye. Shoo away with them, they didn't contribute with anything anyway more than creating their own bubble with using bitcoin. (Sorry about my tone.. :p ).

You could try the methods described here (ads popping, but site is safe).
@_date: 2017-12-30 12:32:09
1. You can choose to share only one public send-to-address if you want (all the old addresses is still functioning).
2. You can check the balance for a specific address on the blockchain (instead of checking the coldwallet for all the addresses at once):

Download winauth for windows, and try again with your secret code (just an idea..).

And shouldnt the fee-cost in btc, go down, when the dollarprice go up, for reflecting that the electricity cost (in dollar-value) is the same?
@_date: 2017-12-30 13:56:01
1. 0 - those that invest in futures and similar.
2. 0.00000001 - 0.1 (a huge group)
3. 0.1 - 100
4. 100-10,000
5. 10,000 or more

Thank you very much, I appreciate the explanation.  
@_date: 2017-12-31 19:56:20
So it is working like this, that when a transaction cost $50, to send $200, it is a choice on our behalf? And we are basically giving huge donations to the miner-pools "unwillingly willingly" where electricity cost and a % reward is not a reference, no queue-line is implemented for transactions, and miners become rich like trolls, where fees is a market itself with losers and winners? (Sorry about my sceptical attitude.. )

the figure/picture in question   
@_date: 2019-11-22 15:45:12
Why can't bitcoin stop the halving process after next year, so that it will still have a reasonable flow of new bitcoin(s)? This would keep bitcoin-mining similar and compared to gold-mining, when there is new bitcoin mined at some reasonable rate and amount, for spreading new coins and for compensating when people lose their wallets/keys (just like how used gold is lost/forgotten.) But also for this issue of that really rich/exchanges/institutions can't ride on the wave of being the big holders or early adopters = centralization around them = a broken flow of new coins and bitcoin might lose attraction(?).
@_date: 2019-11-17 12:17:40
The link or this post doesn't explain whats behind this. Is the story behind this interesting to share or not?
@_date: 2019-11-19 10:37:48
I still don't get the news in this post. Does it mean processed?  Finalized?  Taken care of, as in that transactions went through (or are about to go through)? 
"Consolidate" does not make sense, suggesting that "volume of utxos suddenly went much more compact for a longer time" without reason/not doing anything.  So did transactions went through or not?
@_date: 2019-11-22 19:04:11
Okey. Thanks for the answer (and others answers, appreciated). I am honest, I based myself of some worries/future. But I agree there is other coins/alternatives for it.

 They think games using micro-payments suddenly is going to be loved  "because crypto-currency". I personally don't agree. This is gambling  more than gaming. And it would not be cool if other game-companies start  to use this, where suddenly even more games than before gonna use  micro-payments (scamming kids world over for "blood and money".  i.e.  "kill for looting your friends and get real money for it"). I mean,  games should be friendly and not so serious. The game-company should  take a fee for playing the game plus developing the game, instead of  that a stronger player "become to the fee for the losing player", like  taxing the week player for the game-company. This gonna be autistic.

Theory numbers:
50% of the transactions was made of loans, credits and scams.  
30% was exchanges and whales that moved their funds to different addresses + tether for the paper-bitcoin and paper-crypto at the exchanges.  
15% is holders and traders that transact to them selves?  
5% is transactions by the miners that sell.

Yes, that is why I wrote the comment.   
I believe children could meet the "grown-up-world with money/greed" at some later time than young ages, where developing and learn communication in a friendly environment is more important. 
But I also think, the labeling of this game could be more at "gambling" genre than "gaming", so both the kids and their parent understand and know (and so they are not thinking "ok, it is only a few cents - who cares" but that would also be part of the problem, to learn "to not care about money").

Liechtenstein has 38547 citizens (2017), with an area of 160 km2 (62 sq mi).Does this mean employees will move from Malta to Liechtenstein as well? (Did bittrex-employees work in actually Malta at all?)
Or are they are just copying the content from harddrives in Malta to harddrives in Liechenstein from and to some dudes in cellars with server-hardware? Or what is this really about?

Get the transaction TX id.
Then accelerate your bitcoin here (put the tx in the form):
(But the fee you already used need to be a certain amount for being accepted).
Or here (upper form):
(Does not require you have used a certain fee, but you need to register first at this pool, involving cellphone-registration).
After accelerating, you wait until next few blocks is mined at these pools. 
Can be checked here:
(Scroll down a bit, then there is a list of the last mined blocks and what pools mined them).
