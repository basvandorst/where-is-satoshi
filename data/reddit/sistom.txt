if so, I don't think they'd be using it to fund a defense case.

I'll even upvote you. :)

You have to add a visa credit card to have instant purchasing abilities.

Vulnerable? Robbed?
This is a highly volatile thing to be investing your life savings in. If you're really that hard up for money go buy a lawn mower and start cutting some grass.
It's not anyone's fault but your own if you lose every penny you have because of a silly mistake.
The best rule of thumb to live by is do not invest more than you can happily live without. If you follow that then you'll never be up shit creek without a paddle.

Thanks for your input. It's much appreciated.

I think it's going to go back down to 70ish and then slowly climb up to the 150s over the next few months.
@_date: 2013-04-14 16:33:22
what about for sellers? 
@_date: 2013-12-18 19:31:06
This is sick. Excellent work sir.
@_date: 2013-05-01 13:47:43
keep up the good work sir. :)

I was telling my mother about some of my recent bitcoin ventures yesterday over lunch. Lady sitting at the table beside us overheard me and told us her husband is co-owner of BitPay.
Thought it was ironic and interesting.

looks like mtgox has crashed. Must not have upgraded those servers sufficiently. grrr

you could also expand the center gradient so that it fades evenly all the way to the edges

don't be such a dick.

Agreed. I deposited $250 ($253.95 including ZipZap fees) and ended up only getting credited $214.56. Not quite sure where the rest went? 
3.99% of $250 is only $9.975 leaving me with approximately $240.025.
Somethings awash here.

Attention whore? I'm not asking for anyone's attention but the owner of the company I just conducted business with who was also failed to uphold their side of the deal.
Fuck off 'ky1e'

I don't have anything to hide, but thanks for looking.

Which ass?
@_date: 2013-04-12 03:55:08
this is for selling, not buying.

I don't like the actual bitcoin not being circular...

Mind sharing your cost vs profitability with this setup?

I use a Google Chrome extension that adds a nice little icon to your menu bar.
