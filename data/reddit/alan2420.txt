Already doing it here on testnet, and I've seen main net transaction occur. It's working. The only thing to be skeptical about is how long before nodes start popping up everywhere, and deciding which node you want to select as your primary channel.

Actually it's about 7 cents, so...it's better:
(market price USD / 100 million) * price per satoshi * 3 satoshis * typical bytes per transaction:
(10835/10e07) * 3 * 226 = $0.07

Well, the hope would be that the hub is something like Amazon.com, or Walmart, or Starbucks, etc. Their incentive to connect to lots of people is to sell stuff and earn money. Likewise of course for any big retailers in Asia, Europe, Australia, etc.
Exchanges certainly have an incentive: liquidity, more trading fees, lower on-chain fees.
Any of the above becomes a highly connected hub, and in no time, everybody is connected to everybody.

Version 1 is best of the three. Clean, bright, simple. It feels pretty good overall. 
I like the "people-centric" graphic to the right of "choose your wallet", as opposed to the sterile/technical feel of v2 and v3. The graphic itself isn't special, but the concept of focusing on people, rather than the technology, is a good first impression. Definitely version  has the right idea in that regard. I would say keep developing that concept going forward. Everything about the web site graphic design should be considered within the context of how inviting, warm, welcoming, and secure it makes people feel.

No, it's not a load of bull at all. It's a thought provoking way of considering *reality*. Clearly it made you think. He's right in the sense that: 1) Growth in demand is inevitable, and demand drives innovation. If the demand for more efficient mining accelerates innovation in efficient energy production, then potentially, after an initial growth curve in demand, innovation takes over and energy usage declines. It's an excellent idea for further study and consideration.

I've read quite a few responses that directly addressed your questions, yet all I see from you is responses on different sub-threads, ignoring the answers already given, and re-asking the same stupid question.
It's pretty obvious you're either an idiot who simply cannot grasp the issues at hand, or you're a bcash shill.
You're completely wrong when you say that "politics aren't going to determine the values". That is, in fact, Roger Ver's entire bet, as bcash has no "technical value". There's a lot to be gained by bad actors using politics and lies. It's easier to steal from people than it is to do hard work.
Bcash is a line for line copy of the Bitcoin core source code, minus segwit, minus malleability, plus 8MB blocks. If as many people use bcash as use Bitcoin, then bcash would have the exact same issues that Bitcoin has now, and if bcash just upped the block size repeatedly and indefinitely to keep fees near zero, then 1) The coin would be completely centralized by the small number of nodes that could manage to store the gigantic blockchain, 2) The coin would collapse as the block reward diminished, because with little reward, and no fees, there is no incentive to mine. 
That's it. That's pretty much the only answer to your questions that matters, and you re-asking your stupid question over and over isn't going to produce a better answer. If you don't get it, well, sometimes you just can't cure stupid. That's your problem, not ours.

1/(100/1e08*17697.00) = $56.51
So I wanna buy something that's $25.00, then:
$PRICE/($1/((100 satoshis/1e08)*BTC/USD))

One other thought...
Block  was mined Jan 8 2009
    500,000 blocks * 10 mins = 5,000,000 mins
    5000000 / 60 / 24 = 3472 days
    12/18/2017 - 3472 days = June 16 2008
6/16/2008 is about 6 months before the 1st block.
So that means we've been averaging faster than 10 minutes between blocks overall. I guess that would be explained by the fact that as hash power was added to the network, but the difficulty only adjusts every 2016 blocks (2 weeks), then we've averaged &lt;10 mins per block overall. So the difficulty doesn't adjust to set the global rate since the beginning to 10 mins per block. It just adjusts to set the rate to 10 mins since the last difficulty adjustment.
    12/18/2017 - 1/8/2009     = 3267 days
    3267 * 144 blocks per day = 470448
We should have mined only 470,448 blocks by now (roughly).
    (470448/500000) * 10 mins = 9.4 mins
So we've averaged about 9 mins 24 seconds between blocks since 2009.
ok I was bored and just wanted to understand this...

I'm saying that when there are so few people actually transacting with bcash, and people are still overpaying fees - Roger Ver's biggest talking point being the cost of fees mind you - then it's not block size that is the fee problem. Yes, you overpaid. Many others overpay. That's the high fee part of the problem. The other part of the problem is congestion of blocks, which is primarily caused by large numbers of inefficient transaction (ie uncompressed addresses, no segwit, etc). If all of those variables were not a factor, there would be no congestion, and no high fees, and no whiny Roger Ver character complaining that Bitcoin is broken. On top of that - bcash, which is is nothing but a waste of network bandwidth and mining resources. Bitcoin is working as designed.

Look at this:
And this:
What I find interesting is that bcash has about 10% as many transactions at its absolute peak, but people are paying fees as high as 600+ satoshis per byte. Just as much as on the Bitcoin network. Why? How much more would they be paying if they had 90% of the traffic instead of 10%?
The bcash mempool is cleared out after almost every block, with a few exceptions here and there, so there's no good reason to pay high fees, but still people do it. And even with the paltry number of transactions, there's still bursts of transactions that cause a backlog of 2-3 blocks before their mempool gets completely emptied. If bcash had 90% of the transaction traffic, all their blocks would be full, and they would be paying high fees.
Blocksize is not the issue. The issue is only high fees. People are paying too high fees due to shitty wallets that overestimate and overpay. People are paying too high fees because they don't know how to set a lower fee, or because the software they use doesn't allow it, or make it easy/intuitive, or because people are just too lazy to learn the complexities of Bitcoin.
High fees are caused by:  High price of Bitcoin,  Paying too high of a fee. Blocksize is at best  on the list of "problems".
Well, 1) Crash the price of Bitcoin. Everybody wanna go for that approach? No, me neither. But hey - if the price of Bitcoin was $1.00, then nobody would care about a 500 satoshi fee per byte, because Satoshi's wouldn't be worth so much.
 2) Fix the poor fee estimation and improve manual fee calculations and user interface. Make the process of estimating, calculating, and paying fees intuitive on every wallet. That includes Bitcoin core. There is no wallet that does it right.
I never pay a wallets estimated fee. I check the mempool at the sites above, and pick the lowest possible fee that will get my transaction through in about 12 hours (at worst), and I always pay less than any wallet fee estimator. Right now, I'm willing to not transact to avoid the fees. If enough people wait, the mempool will clear.
Just want to emphasize this. The main problem is not block size! It's overpaying fees + the high price of Bitcoin that is the problem. We don't want Bitcoin's price to crash, so fixing the fee estimation and fee user interface in all wallets should really be the  priority.
If Bcash had 90% of the transactions, they would be paying out the ass the same as we are for the same reasons. Big blocks don't solve anything, but they do cause lots of other problems.
@_date: 2017-12-27 03:26:02
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:46:47
No, my argument is that bcash has fees nearly as high as Bitcoin, even with 8MB blocks, 1/10 the number of transactions, and a regularly cleared mempool.
This is probably too complicated for you to understand, as is the case for most bcash sockpuppets.
@_date: 2017-12-19 05:28:29
Nobody who knows how to calculate and set an optimal fee is paying that much. A significant part of the problem is the wallets that estimate fees way too high.

I don't think hash power "belongs" to Bitcoin. It's just a fact of Bitcoin that ASIC mining is controlled by a few very powerful mining cartels. The people in charge of those companies want to control Bitcoin, and they are willing to wreck Bitcoin and wipe out every investor if that's what it takes to accomplish it.
If you actually believe it's wise for 2 or 3 companies to control Bitcoin, then by all means, invest your money in Bitcoin Cash.
@_date: 2017-11-13 05:25:37
There's a "difficulty" value in Bitcoin. It's a number - a multiplier - which makes it more or less difficult to find a hash for a block. The number automatically adjusts up or down depending on the total hashpower of the network.
When a miner searches for a block hash, they are randomly searching for what is essentially a number that is smaller than a certain target number. This gets harder to do the higher the difficulty multipler.
The difficulty is adjusted by the network every 2016 blocks, with the goal of maintaining an interval of 10 minutes between blocks. In other words, if on average over the 2016 blocks, blocks are found every 9 minutes, then the difficulty needs to go up to push the average to 10 minutes. If blocks were found every 11 minutes, then the difficulty needs to go down to push the  average to 10 minutes.
With Bitcoin Cash, it's been a clusterfuck. They knew their scam altcoin could not survive with a low market value, so they put in an "emergency difficulty adjustment", where the difficulty on that chain rapidly adjusts downwards if the block time is too high. This would result in the bcash difficulty going *way down*, until they were generating for example 7.25 blocks per 10 minute interval. That rapid creation of blocks, multiplied by a lower market value, made bcash mining reward more profitable than Bitcoin's mining reward, so miners would then switch to it en masse to rapidly mine blocks and make more money on what is otherwise a far less profitable altcoin. Then eventually the bcash difficulty adjusts upwards because the interval is too low, and so now bcash is less profitable (due to lower market value), and the miners switch back to Bitcoin.
It's been a real mess, and it was created by people who have absolutely no ethics whatsoever. They are willing to destroy the network, kill Bitcoin, and wipe out the value of Bitcoin investors, just to push their agenda for a "Bitcoin Cash" altcoin with larger blocks.
Soon, they will change their difficulty adjustment algorithm so it does not oscillate so much. They aim to make their difficulty adjust up or down faster, over a 144 block average (24 hours), to better maintain the 10 minute interval. Exactly how this will play out remains to be seen, but it's my estimation that it should stabilize BCH at it's lower mining reward value, which should stabilize mining in favor of BTC. Then they will have to rely on market tactics alone to improve the value of their coin to compete with Bitcoin.
I don't know if a 5 year old would understand this or not but that's the best I can do. ;-)
@_date: 2017-11-12 18:08:21
It doesn't make sense economically for hashpower to split in proportion to BTC:BCH price. If you're mining blocks, you're either going to mine the more profitable block, or the less profitable block. Of course, some may elect to forgo additional profit to prop up the altcoin and drag out this tedious and totally unnecessary split of hashpower, but it makes no sense in the long run.
The more I think about it, the more it seems like this is just phase 2 of a big bluff. Just like segwit2x was nothing more than a bluff. These guys are all bark, no bite. They are burning money to try to prove a point. If everybody holds steady, BCH will just disappear with a whimper.

At the start that you asserted that you are a "moral" person living by the "moral philosophy" of non-aggression.
Then, in every subsequent argument, you used "amoral" arguments to support a singular point: legalizing drugs.
You repeatedly used the example of prohibition drug gangs wreaking violence and death, implying that society's acceptance of repealing prohibition was to avoid the criminality and violence of prohibition. But look at that just a little deeper and it falls apart: how many people in prohibition era alcohol gangs were killed? Go look it up and add up all the bodies of Capone era gangsters. Now, how many people have died from the use of alcohol, or drunk driving accidents? Should we even bother finding the real numbers? I assert that the latter is greater than the former by many orders of magnitude. But from this, you construe, that it was "moral" for society to let people drink, so that there were fewer violent gangs producing alcohol, but rather many times more innocents dying as a result of the abuses of alcohol.  This is not a moral argument. It's an amoral, relativistic, flat out lazy and totally contradictory argument which asserts that because society wanted to consume alcohol, it was thus moral to do so, despite greater harm being caused by legalizing it.
Here, in your latest post, you demonstrate perfectly how lazy you are:


False! You didn't even read the article you used to support your assertion. It says:
"Drug legalization removes all criminal penalties for producing, selling and using drugs; **no country has tried it**. In contrast, *decriminalization, as practiced in Portugal*, eliminates jail time for drug users but maintains criminal penalties for dealers."

The goal of the current EDA was to prevent the hashpower from falling to zero by rapidly lowering the difficulty. Too rapidly, which then caused BCH to be briefly profitable at a lower market value until the difficulty adjusted up again.

@_date: 2017-11-14 17:05:31


Your grasp on the realities of heroin, and heroin addiction, and lawful distribution of heroin, are as nonsensical as the warp drive, which is why I introduced it into the debate.
The main thrust of your argument is that, of all the many things to be concerned about in this context - heroin's mind-altering toxicity, its *permanently* addictive qualities, its substantial likelihood of outright killing you - no...never mind any of those...your sole concern revolves around whether or not a person goes to jail for using it, possessing it, getting addicted to it, but thankfully not dying from it. Parallel to your trivial legal concern, you abstract the principals of peaceful non-violent hippie-love heroin users who commit no crimes of property, passion, poor judgement, or outright malice, in pursuit of their addictive substance.
Thus, I cognitively and dissonantly assert that (A) You have no children (if you did, you would be far more concerned that they die from heroin than that they go to jail for using or possessing it), (B) You have never known a heroin addict (if you did, you wouldn't be arguing any of this nonsense as most families and friends of heroin addicts welcome the incarceration of their loved ones just to stop them from harming themselves and others), (C) You have probably never known a convicted felon (you display a bias towards people convicted of felonies), (D) You are probably unaware that you know a convicted felon who conceals his past and is doing just fine in regular life (again, your bias precludes you from recognizing that a normal, happy, productive person may have erred earlier in life and rebounded from it), (E) You are a snowflake writing fiction on reddit to pass the time (that's just 98% of the time true no matter who on reddit), (F) You are full of shit (that's the dissonant part just because I like to keep it real when I'm talking to a snowflake). 
I'm sorry to call you out on it all so brusquely, but your naivety just oozes all over the page from every sentence you construct, so I can't help myself.
Your fictional junkie friend - if he really existed - would tell you that he spends more time every day worrying about how never to succumb to taking heroin ever again than he does worry about the difficulty of finding a steady job. I'm telling you heroin is really, really, really bad, and there's no moral argument for legalizing it that is not outweighed by the immorality of creating more heroin addicts. 
And don't strawman the debate with cigarettes and alcohol et al. They are each a separate issue with distinctly different problems (the negative qualities of which I would agree upon as a former smoker). Here, I'm only debating heroin. 
But I'm done with you. For real this time! Abstract arguments with fake people get boring quickly. Goodbye!  :-)

You are buying into the FUDL spread by the other sub. The fact of the matter is, if they weren't trying to destroy Bitcoin so they can gain control of your coins, then Bitcoin would be just fine. This is only happening because of the shitty BCH EDA that is currently stealing over half the hashpower.

Nothing. That was a Zork reference - joking around with someone who has twice responded to me that they don't understand what I'm saying. You posted a string of "death spiral" concerns and asked if there was a pattern. I thought my initial reply was perfectly clear. What's wrong with you?
@_date: 2017-11-16 17:56:33
Yes - we agree. I was just offering the thought that devs creating new posts that share their own thoughts to start a conversation would probably be more productive than commenting on existing posts or responding to attacks. A post once a week / month from a dev saying "Just committed a new feature!" with a few comments and link to the repo might encourage regular users to dig a little deeper.
@_date: 2017-11-16 17:47:08
Developers are not salesmen, and doing PR would just eat up more of their time. However, that said, I do think they have good information to offer and should try to promote their own innovation a little more, via blog or social media. 
I see posting a lot, but I notice mostly he's responding to misinformation or ugly attacks, which I think is a misuse of his time and talent. My advice to him is, it would be better if instead he just wrote a brief post now and then describing new advancements, upcoming features, or just offering some positive cool thoughts on whatever topic he likes. Responding to negativity drains positive energy.

No. When the BCH EDA difficulty goes up, the miners will switch back to BTC and clear the mempool. Your transaction will go through.

You're being disingenuous and pessimistic. Anyone would admit that there are scaling issues to be solved. That's why the devs from all groups and all sides are working on the problem. That doesn't mean it has failed. When you have an explosion in growth, that's a good problem. It doesn't indicate "failure". It indicates success with new challenges. I assume you've never run a business in your life? If you had, you'd know that growth spurts in a business are sometimes harder to deal with than the startup. Success is extremely challenging! The future looks bright for Bitcoin. Naysayers will not prevail.

I'm well aware of the discrepancy in income across the world. It says $33,500 puts you amongst the richest 5%. I considered the possibility of only 1% of the population contributing $2 per day, which according to your own cited source for population wealth distribution, is arguably within reach of 5% of the population.
The site says people who make $100,000 are in the wealthiest 0.3%, therefore, considering only that group, there are 22,200,000 potential contributors to support the BTC price. It follows then that an average contribution of about $4 per day from the total population of people earning $100K or more will support a BTC price of $50,000.

No hostility here. There's not anything "inherently wrong" with 2MB blocks. It's just that under the current circumstances, there is no consensus for a block size increase. The majority of Bitcoin users don't want a short term fix that requires a hard fork. They want a solution that will scale. And a lot of people are sore about the bcash attack, because it's been a gigantic pointless exercise that just harms the whole Bitcoin community. For example - there is absolutely no reason - zero reason - why all the big block bcash shills could not be perfectly happy with Litecoin. It has faster blocks, and a lower market value, and can handle plenty of small low fee transactions, and it has been around for years. Anyone who was truly concerned about an interim solution for transacting with low fees with an alternate version of Bitcoin could have easily just moved to Litecoin. Instead, they've attacked Bitcoin with a centralized mining cartel and a bunch of shills like Roger Ver who's sole purpose is to gain control of Bitcoin and assume control of the "brand". They literally want to kill the Bitcoin blockchain and replace it with their own big block version of it. This is an ongoing battle, so people aren't too receptive to suggestions like "why not 2MB now just for a little while?". People that ask that question don't understand the problem of decentralization.
EDIT: And I'll just add for clarification that the only reason they do not use Litecoin is because it has a different hashing algorithm, therefore, the big ASIC miners would not profit from it.

So you want heroin to be legal? Where do you draw the line? You think it should be legal to buy it at the local 7-11 convenience store if you're 18 or 21? You realize there's a reason it's illegal? It's totally destructive. It's uncontrollably addictive for most people after using it just once or twice. It ruins human beings. (and yes, of course, alcohol can do all the same to people - but we're talking about heroin right now. Don't use a two wrongs make a right argument)

The problem is, your theoretical bullshit - which in principal I agree with *theoretically* - is not how the real world works. When you have a scientific theory, and observation doesn't support it, out the fucking window goes the theory.
In the real world, producers and users of heroin do not behave peacefully. They behave violently, and recklessly, and often they do so with the total lack of good judgement that comes under the influence of the drugs they are on. You cannot be a lollipop libertarian with a clear head full of delightful whimsical theories when you are so addicted to heroin you are willing to rob or kill someone to get more of it just to take the pain away.
Theories are nice. Unicorns are also pretty great! But the real world is where we are. Live in it.
Edit: also, the bit about "if my child"...pretty funny. I'm guessing you don't actually have children, and you definitely don't have a child acting out on drugs, because if you did, you would know how ridiculous is your assertion that jail would be the worst thing to befall a heroin addicted child. Death is the worst thing.

Seems like all existing exchanges could and would want to open channels to all other exchanges. Some future new exchange might promote itself as the new lightning exchange, and everybody opens channels with it. In essence, LN becomes a network of off-chain liquidity, which is basically what any individual exchange is now. So everybody has an exchange channel and can find the market price due to high liquidity, and then spend @ Walmart, Starbucks etc via their LN channels, and basically keep their money entirely in the LN and only settle on the blockchain when they need a fiat on/off ramp.

Coinbase charges a premium. The trick is this: sign up for GDAX, which is part of Coinbase. Uses same login etc. Transfers from Coinbase to GDAX are free, post-only/maker orders on the exchange are free, and transfers of BTC out of GDAX back to Coinbase or any private address are free. Coinbase is for new users and quick purchase credit card users, ease of use, etc, but GDAX is the way to go if you want to save money.

Also, just to clarify - you only get hit with the funding fee if you buy BTC on Coinbase directly. If instead you just fund the USD account, and wait for it to clear (5 days-ish), then there's no purchase fee on Coinbase - but they still charge the premium. But GDAX does not charge the premium. So...fund account...wait...buy with a limit-post only order on GDAX.

It's not "another layer". Once you setup the GDAX account, you just login and buy. Coinbase and GDAX USD accounts are linked and moving money USD/BTC between them is FREE and instantaneous.

No, you're trying to justify legalizing and propagating a substance that is *guaranteed* to create more violence and death. Simple as that. I should stop here. ;-) But one more thing...


A heroin user's life is not ruined by jail. A heroin user's life is ruined by using heroin. Are you going to argue that there are no ex-convicts leading full and productive lives?
I also note that you did not refute the fact that you do not have children, and are thus in fact likely pulling all of your arguments out of your ass.

When the BCH EDA flips back to "normal" difficulty, the only profitable move for the miners will be to come back to Bitcoin. Have you looked at the fees in the mempool? They are &gt;$50K per block. The only reason they can maintain this attack is because BCH is pumping out 7.5 hyper-inflated blocks every 10 mins.
When the BCH EDA hardfork happens, I honestly don't see how the altcoin will be able to continue. It's not profitable, even with a seriously pumped up price.
The only way they succeed is if people here, new users, and investors scared of the volatility let themselves be affected by the Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt. And Lies!  Better known as FUDL.

Yeah, I'm well aware of the term. "Structuring" is just government fear mongering BS. It's very hard for the government to prove someone's intent to do something illegal if you're just a regular guy making regular deposits from one of your investments. And the fact of the matter is, banks &amp; govt don't notice if you're moderately smart about it. Exchange withdrawals should go to multiple banks, different types of accounts, different investment accounts, etc. Diversification is not illegal. You really have to move huge amounts of cash in reckless ways, or screw up on your taxes, to get on the radar of the government. And I was not implying someone should break the law. But it's not illegal to do everything possible to stay off the radar.

You're just trolling the other extreme end of the debate. Most people don't save anything. They spend it all, and on top of that put themselves into terrible amounts of debt. Even if Bitcoin is wildly successful at making people think about saving more, there will still be plenty of money to move around the economy. More importantly, if we could get our government to pinch pennies the way we all have to, we wouldn't be pissing away unfathomably huge sums of money on public debt interest, which would allow for lower taxes.

The IRS knows only what is reported to them (assuming you're not under audit and being actively investigated.)
If you sell BTC on an exchange, and that exchange has your identity/SSN and reports the sale to the IRS, then it will be up to you to provide documentation to the IRS as to the cost basis of your investment to minimize the capital gain. If you bought with cash and have no record of the purchase, the IRS may consider your cost basis to be $0.00.

NO.

I agree. The bcash EDA change is happening today. If Roger Ver wants to sell all of his BTC and walk the order books down to the bottom, then today should be his day to lose all of his money. Be strong Bitcoin hodlers. Hodl! 
The new DAA algorithm seeks to accomplish the following objectives:
 
Adjust difficulty to hash rate to target a mean block interval of 600 seconds.
Avoid sudden changes in difficulty when hash rate is fairly stable.
Adjust difficulty rapidly when hash rate changes rapidly.
Avoid oscillations from feedback between hash rate and difficulty.
Be resilient to attacks such as timestamp manipulation.
 
This algorithm is based on a 144-period simple moving average.  The difficulty is adjusted each block, based on the amount of work done and the elapsed time of the previous 144 blocks.
 
To compute the difficulty, we begin with the three topmost blocks, and choose the one with the median timestamp of the three.  Next, the process is repeated with blocks 144, 145, and 146 (blocks of 144-146 height less than the current) and a median timestamp block is again chosen from those 3.
From these 2 blocks roughly 144 blocks apart, we define W as the amount of work done between the blocks, and T as the elapsed time between the blocks.  A high-low filter is applied so that T has maximum value of 2 days and a minimum value of .5 days.  This prevents difficulty from changing too abruptly. (Normally 144 blocks takes approximately 1 day).
 
We can then compute:
Wn = W * ExpectedBlockTime / T .
G = (2^256 / Wn) - 1
 
This is our difficulty target.  Lastly, a final filter is applied to enforce a maximal target.
Activation of the new consensus rules will be done on a median time stamp basis on blocks that occur after timestamp 1510600000, which corresponds to November 13th, 7:06 PM GMT.  This activation code has been merged.

Hmmm...that bodes quite well actually. You're saying 10,000,000 people investing a meager $10 per day will easily support a price of $55,555.00. Or 1,000,000 people investing $100 per day, or 2M people investing $50 per day. How many people on Earth now? 7.4 billion? 1% of that is 74,000,000. 74M people investing $2 per day average would support $82,222 per BTC. I enjoy thinking of it in these terms. I could play with these numbers all day. ;-)
@_date: 2017-11-13 15:00:08
My theory is that they plan to try to dump the BTC price so it's more profitable for miners to mine the lower difficulty coin. The only way this is effective is if people sell. If everybody had limit sell orders at or above where we are now, or just stays off the order books entirely, then even a whale can't do much harm. People just need to know so they don't fear the attack.
@_date: 2017-11-14 19:50:56
Also, even market orders on GDAX are pretty cheap. So if you don't want to worry about placing a limit post-only order and waiting for it to execute, just go Buy &gt; Market amount and done. The fee is .25%, ie, for .01 BTC @ $6500 ($65) = 6500 * .01 * .0025 = 0.1625 (16 cents)

I don't know. Until we see how the new EDA behaves in the real world, I don't think anybody knows. My co-workers and I ran a simulation on the new EDA and hashpower started modulating at around BCH &gt; 0.75 x BTC but it was not a very elaborate simulation, and you can't easily simulate a mining cartel that is acting against profit incentives to accomplish an attack.
@_date: 2017-11-12 14:14:43
The difficulty will adjust up or down quickly to maintain a steadier normal rate of one block every 10 mins, as opposed to what it's doing now, where the EDA allows 7.5 blocks every 10 mins, which is the only reason BCH is more profitable than BTC to mine.
Look at the reward for fees per block BTC vs BCH. $53161 vs $23 at the time I reviewed it. Fifty three thousand in BTC fees, vs twenty bucks for BCH.
Look at the total block reward for BTC vs BCH even with the totally fake pumped-to-dump BCH price. $131634 vs $20522. 
But BCH is cranking out 7.25 blocks (90.625 hyper-inflated coins) every 10 mins while BTC is doing 0.33 blocks thanks to the BCH EDA stealing hashpower.
So, roughly, BCH = 7.25 x 12.5 x 1400 = $126875 (no fees in BCH blocks worth noting) vs BTC = 0.33 x 12.5 x 6300 + 50000 = $75987.50.
That means that even at the unsustainable super-pumped price, BCH is little more than a hedge against BTC when the BCH EDA is hyper-inflating the currency and stealing more than half the hashpower. But it's such a waste of effort. If BCH simply didn't exist, and there was no split in hashpower, then BTC would be raking in bigger, steadier profits for the miners, and creating a better experience for users.

Using resources on someone's computer without them being aware of it is definitely malicious. Hiding a process that does something wholly unrelated to the software the user thinks they are running is malicious. Your comparison to ad's is flawed. An ad is something you can *see*. You can choose to close it. You can choose to block an ad. You can choose not to visit the web site because it had ads. There's nothing in the Chrome extension the OP described that warns the user it will heavily utilize CPU to mine Monero for someone other than the user if the extension is used. Clear cut case of malware.

And part of the blame is the government stepping in and bailing out the banks on the taxpayer's dime, thus insuring the unreasonable risk the banks took in the first place against any losses. They should have been left to bleed and die. New players would have stepped in and paid the real value for them. Markets would have been reorganized based on the real value of the banks assets, and risks would have been reassessed based on real risk.

He was referring to mBTC obviously. You gotta admit, this is another thing about Bitcoin that makes life needlessly painful for non-technical users. I don't know why wallets force people to jump through these hoops of converting between BTC per KB, mBTC, and Satoshi per byte. Your average clerk at a cash register can't subtract one number from another. God help them all figuring out a Bitcoin fee. 
Anyway, just to help the guy out a bit more using your example:
[BTC/USD price] / one hundred million (satoshis per BTC) * fee in satoshis = cost in USD
(3790/100000000)*36000 = $1.36

The other thing people should understand is that the Coinbase price is significantly marked up from the current GDAX exchange price. For example, right now, a buy on GDAX is 4839.55 while the same buy on Coinbase is 4863.75 (via bank account) plus $29.36 in fees.
Once you have signed up for both Coinbase and GDAX, transfer USD wallet to GDAX wallet for free, then buy BTC on GDAX.
Furthermore, on GDAX, if you want to avoid all market fees (assuming you're just a person who wants to get an order executed reasonably quickly near the market price), place a Buy/Limit order a few cents or more below the market price, spin open the Advanced section and make sure "Post Only" is checked, Good Until Cancelled, then place the order. Price is volatile so the order is very certain to execute. If it keeps moving up, you can just cancel the order and retry at a higher target (still beneath the market price).
Once the buy order executes, transfer your BTC to a private wallet. GDAX pays the Bitcoin miner fees, so that's free as well.
It's a good deal if you know how to take advantage of all they are offering.

US exchanges are not in danger of closing. Europe, Mexico, many others - no issues. Even if they all did shut down, there's P2P exchanges and Localbitcoins. Worst case you get on Reddit and say, "Hey I've got 1 BTC I want to unload for 500 bucks", accept an offer, and work out how to get paid. 
Centralized exchanges simply provide liquidity and convenient on ramps.  But there's no "stopping" trading. There's no "stopping" Bitcoin.

Imagine if, instead of the government printing more money every day to "invisibly" make *your* money more worthless - imagine instead that your paper dollars were digital OLED displays on a piece of paper, connected to the central bank, and they updated in real time to show you their value, and instead of the central bank printing more money, they simple decreased the denomination on the digital display of your "notes" to reflect their actual value. Think about that. You could sit there, looking at money in your wallet, and watch it become worthless.

Not true. You can always mine more gold. Dig deeper. Dig in different places. More gold. Mine an asteroid. More gold. Technically the amount of gold is potentially "infinite". The only thing required is "more work" to get it. And that's exactly how Bitcoin works as well, and with a cap on the supply. The cap is just a feature of Bitcoin, but the work to create it is real.


Open your wallet. See those "legal tenders" in there? They're just pieces of paper stuck between two pieces of stitched up cowhide, backed by absolutely nothing "real" except the "faith and credit" of the government. How much faith did you have in the government in 2008/2009? And "credit"? Have you checked Uncle Sam's credit card statement lately? 20 Trillion. The government is steadily inflating us into a state of permanent poverty. People don't realize it most of the time because it happens slowly, but when bubble's burst, it is felt, and that combined with technology is how Bitcoin was born. Look at a $100 bill in your wallet. Three months later check it again - it's $99. 3 months later - $98. Why? Don't you care that they're making your money worth less and less everyday, on top of all the taxes; on top of all the debt?


Hasn't happened. Exact opposite has happened. Won't happen. Can't be stopped now. That ship has sailed.

Because the s2x attack isn't meant to cleanly fork into two chains with replay protection. It's meant to control the blockchain by changing the rules and mining on top of those new rules with a majority of miners.

The math on mining is pretty simple. There's calculators online that give you an idea of the variables. 
I've written a pretty thorough python script that games out a bunch of different scenarios, mostly just to amuse myself.
Bottom line: assuming moderate electricity costs, moderate mining hardware costs, a stable BTC price, no equipment failures, very good uptime, and no major upsets in network difficulty - figure 10 months to break even, best case scenario.
Realistically something will not go your way, pushing the break even point out to a year or well beyond. With free electricity, you have an edge, but there's still plenty of other variables to consider. If BTC price crashes: you're screwed. Mining hardware dies: you're screwed. New mining hardware comes out the day after you invest in yours and it gets deployed by everybody in Asia doubling difficulty in a matter of months: you're utterly and completely screwed. And so on... ;-)
If you can't do the math and estimate the ROI yourself, then you probably shouldn't do it.
@_date: 2017-10-13 23:06:38


I meant - the network needs margin for error, ie typical_propagation_time + margin, to ensure all nodes have the latest block. So - the network assumes 10 minutes is enough, and obviously it has been, but, what is the least possible propagation time? On average? And how much has it varied/declined/improved from 2010 to 2017?

I agree, generally, but I could point you to plenty of people who fancy themselves "anarchist" and would disagree with your definition.


The fact that I disagree with you is proof that your assertion is false. ;)


I guess to get this back on topic and answer the question directly, my answer is: generally speaking (exceptions of course), class action lawsuits are bullshit; they do not protect or help anyone via typical reward of $1.00 checks mailed to all members of the class; they vastly enrich lawyers and empower special interests, thus undermining any alleged concern about the distribution of power; and lastly - Ver and Garzik wouldn't have enough money to pay a meaningful sum in such a suit even if it was successful. For the most part, I consider the question to be a waste of time.
In finance, there is no better way to protect your money than to stop and think more about what you are doing. Personal responsibility. I don't know how you made leap from "personal responsibility is good" to "objectivism is bullshit".

Good idea. I think Bitcoin and vape shops go hand in hand. But why not just run a laptop with a full node at your stores? The clerks at Vape shops always spend a lot of time chatting with customers anyway. Your clerks could just take their cash, scan their receive QR code, and send the coin to their wallet like a regular retail transaction. Train them to add whatever standard markup above the market price you want, perhaps have a little ready-made spreadsheet calculator on there to easily punch in current BTC/GBP and BTC amount to calculate the correct/desired price. That would avoid the expense and risk of the ATMs. You'd just have to fund your wallet with however much BTC you think you'll sell every day or week, no different from your other inventory. And of course, offer a nice little sale or coupon incentive to customers who purchase with BTC!

No, it's a really good idea, because my full node is *my* full node, and I don't want older clients that are already going to be connected to 2x nodes relaying transactions to my node. I don't know what the thinking is behind people that run ancient 0.9.x nodes and the like - I'm sure they've got some political reason for refusing to upgrade - but those are uncommon. The people running 0.12.x - 0.14.x nodes are obviously running fairly modern builds and have no good particular reason not to upgrade. They're going to end up connected to 2x nodes only because of neglect or laziness. So they're banned from my node, at least during the immediate days surrounding the fork. It's time for people to get with the program and get their software up to date.

"**Following** the fork, Coinbase will continue referring to the **current bitcoin blockchain as Bitcoin (BTC)** and the forked blockchain as Bitcoin2x (B2X)."
The 2nd blog post said:
"....customers asked us to clarify what will happen **after** the fork. We are going to call **the chain with the most accumulated difficulty Bitcoin.**

Sounds like what you're describing is something like a dynamic multi-sig wallet, where members can join/leave the group, ergo join/leave the multi-sig wallet, and the wallet requires a majority of the fluctuating number of members to sign a transaction to spend the funds in it. Not sure if something like that has been done (the dynamic part). 
If the group membership is fixed, then yes, it can definitely be done.

What your article really clarified for me - and it was a major lightbulb moment - is the realization that folks here are often talking past each other when debating, because one is attempting to speak strictly with regards to the technical rules of the Bitcoin network, while the other is taking into consideration the economics (people, business, money) of any given node, and particularly a node that is processing many transactions on the network.
I see now what a huge risk Coinbase is taking if they follow S2X without a replay-protected hard fork and list S2X as BTC.
Now the interesting question is: *Why would they go ahead and do it anyway?*  I'm trying to game that scenario out to understand what they may be thinking...

This is the difficulty of these discussions: one point can't be argued without considering another point, and another, and another. Yes, your coins are safe in your own wallet where you control the private keys. Yes, as long as you don't move them, they remain safe. But what good is Bitcoin that can't be moved? If BTC &amp; S2X fork and stay alive as separate chains, then you have an economic interest in protecting your assets on both chains if you want to utilize those assets on either chain. But you can't move assets on one chain without jeopardizing the other (particularly non-technical users). Hence, the situation just plain sucks.

So the idea is, the whole network needs to propagate the newest block, with some margin for error? EDIT: Does the network have a way of knowing what the average propagation time is over a recent period of time?
On the BCH chain, when they are making a block every minute, do they end up with a lot of orphaned blocks? If not, is that because only a couple big miners are providing all the hash power?

1) Yes - and no. The point is - you're protecting yourself. Eventually you presumably will make a transaction, if for no other reason than to send BTC to an exchange and convert it to USD to send it back to your bank account.
2) Not really. But again, per  since you will presumably eventually make at least one transaction, by running a full node, you will be protected when you do. From your wallet to an exchange. From an exchange to your wallet. Etc.
3) Blah. See  and 
4) You don't "have" to transact. You just "will" transact (unless you die and no one in your family knows how to access your wallet or use your private keys). By running a full node, you are trusting the blockchain, and no one else.
5. You'll see transactions essentially instantaneously when running a full node, and confirmations come in as quickly as the network propagates them.
Run a full node. Download Bitcoin-Qt 0.14.2 (or 0.15.0 when it's released).

Yeah, that's an interesting way of contemplating the situation. I think ultimately the only thing that is going to make them see the light is a lot of feedback from customers and Bitcoin users in general.
On the other hand...if you have enough money to acquire 51% hashpower (trivial for a government), then the same applies...you can own the network and bend the rules to your will. 
Bitcoin has always been about consensus amongst competing interests...a unity of opposites...a hippie commune of conniving capitalists...that's what makes it so damn interesting.

So it's a gamble in the crypto war? Spamming costs money up front, yes? So they are shelling out cold hard bitcoin to spam the mempool in hopes of...what? Pushing fees up a little to make people unhappy? In which case, pro-BTC (or anti-BCH) miners counter that effort by just mining low-fee / no-fee transactions to clear it out?

Is that true? Does the entire network really need to serve the lowest common denominator? I'm not sure everybody agrees on that. I'm certainly skeptical of that idea.

Wait for the bottom. Then buy (more). Then HODL.
Or buy on the downward trajectory to an unknown bottom. Then HODL.
Or GTFO if you can't take the stress of it all anymore. Seriously. ;-) It's always been highly speculative. If the volatility makes you stressed, move your money to a more stable investment. Bitcoin has never been for the faint of heart.

I'm not an Ethereum guy, so I admit I don't know much about that fork compares to a theoretical BTC/B2X split, technically, or politically. If S2X gets 95% miners, and Coinbase follows the S2X chain, while still listing it as "BTC", what happens in that scenario? How will anyone know what the heck is going on and what ticker refers to what chain and what chain has what value etc? That's why it seems to me like the S2X attack intends to be a winner takes all proposition. It wins, or fails completely. But I definitely could be wrong and I am sincerely seeking the informed opinions of others who can game out all the possible scenarios.

You can point your SPV wallet to your full node. For example, in Breadwallet (now just "Bread" I believe), you can go the advanced settings and specify an IP address for a node you trust. The only node you can really trust is your own.
@_date: 2017-10-25 01:35:12
Doesn't seem to clarify anything. Seems almost contrary to what was said previously.
First they said:
Any customer with a BTC balance on Coinbase at the time of the fork will be credited with an equal amount of the B2X asset on the Bitcoin2x blockchain. No action is required — we will automatically credit your account. So, if you have 5 BTC stored on Coinbase before the fork; you will have 5 BTC and 5 B2X following the event.
Now they say:
However, some customers asked us to clarify what will happen after the fork. We are going to call the chain with the most accumulated difficulty Bitcoin.
We will make a determination on this change, once we believe the forks are in a stable state. We may consider other factors such as market cap or community support to determine stability.
So what the heck would that mean? If B2X chain goes faster, then they are going to call B2X "BTC" and call what was "BTC" B2X? Makes no sense.
@_date: 2017-10-01 19:57:24
Seems like what everyone is forgetting in all of this is the word "consensus".
Consensus was always a social construct in addition to being a technical construct in Bitcoin. I've often had the thought that us Bitcoiners may actually just be a bunch of deluded hippie-utopian-idealists, because fundamentally, the consensus part requires us all to work together.
Now instead, everybody is getting a taste of what happens when the idea of consensus is replaced with the idea of anarchy.

I know how it works, but I don't know what you're talking about. Resource requirements? You mean like, how much bandwidth and storage my full node needs? Man, that's yesterday's debate. The way forward is much more interesting.

If the vast majority of Bitcoin Core nodes just sit tight when the S2X fork happens, won't this problem just politely go away?
Scenario: Some % of miners mine S2X. Core nodes ignore. Holders hodl. Transactions slow to a crawl or halt as exchanges warn everyone. A few noobs might lose coin due to lack of replay protection. Media goes apoplectic. DDoS attacks on miners and S2X nodes. Human sacrifice. Dogs and cats living together. Mass hysteria. And then...Core prevails?
Didn't pretty much all of this nonsense happen already with XT?

Sounds like that alternate reality you were mentioning a moment ago. I switched my full node storage from a big RAID5 to a pair of RAID1 SSD's. The rig just sits there, totally silent, doing it's job, and the blockchain can hit 4TB before I have to think about it again. We can grow. The fact is, we can't stop or even slow growth as long as the price keeps going up. 
@_date: 2017-10-25 15:59:27
And let me just add to the lack of clarity, based on what I think you are referring to:
In the first blog post, they said:
"**Following** the fork, Coinbase will continue referring to the current bitcoin blockchain as Bitcoin (BTC) and the forked blockchain as Bitcoin2x (B2X)."
In the 2nd blog post, they misquoted themselves, and replaced the word "following" with "at the time of the fork":
"In our prior blog post we indicated that **at the time of the fork**, the existing chain will be called Bitcoin and the Segwit2x fork will be called Bitcoin2x."
That, of course, doesn't make any fucking sense. That's *not* what they said in the prior blog post. They said:
"**Following** the fork, Coinbase will continue referring to the current bitcoin blockchain as Bitcoin (BTC) and the forked blockchain as Bitcoin2x (B2X)."
What is "at the time of the fork"? Is that referring to the 40 seconds during which the first S2X block hits the network? It's meaningless. It's undefined. It's not what they said in the 1st blog post.
@_date: 2017-10-13 22:34:13
I understand the point, but...even those on the core side agree that eventually the blockchain will need to scale. Certainly the network/internet of 2009 was slower than the network of 2017. I have 100mbps down/8mbps up on a residential cable connection, and while I'm certainly not a data center, I can move quite a bit of data. I don't know...I just thought maybe the interval might be an easier thing to talk about adjusting with consensus than block size...

Not sure I buy that you're an anarchist if you're contemplating the plausibility of a class action lawsuit. Not sure I'd even believe that you're a libertarian (or understand the definition). Libertarianism and anarchism both boil down to personal responsibility don't they? So, if I'm hovering my finger over the "Buy BTC" button on bitcoin.com, it is my responsibility to really understand what I am buying. A true anarchist would be promoting warning people about what BTC vs B2X is, not contemplating class action lawsuits.
That said, Roger Ver is such an intolerable douchebag, if someone did file a class action suit, I wouldn't go out of my way to remove myself as a member of the class. ;-)
@_date: 2017-10-13 22:40:49
I run a full node as well. But...the blocks wouldn't all be full, right? They'd be fuller when stuff was happening like now, drop in hash rate, spam, etc, but otherwise it would just be more closely spaced smaller blocks...overhead excepted... no?

No. Miners secure the network. You don't need more miners to process more transactions. If difficulty dropped to 1 (hypothetically obviously),  one miner on a well connected network could mine all the blocks the same as many miners. Of course there would be other serious issues with that scenario, but the primary point is answering your question:  no.
