i can't agree with you more, I knew I should have just locked up the gains...
@_date: 2013-04-14 17:58:44
Thank you!

As long as it's money you can afford to lose :)
To put things into perspective, as long as you have your health, wealth, and children (if no children, at least someone you care about), then treat this experience as an important lesson that is just testing you, it's just money, it comes and goes, those other things above are more important.

I'm very concerned with the fact it doesn't take much money to manipulate the price of bitcoin. With such a small market, even $1 million can make a significant impact. What are your thoughts about market makers in the bitcoin market?
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:35:43
Hey man, are you alright? You seem to be having some issues....as it seems you have to put people down in order to feel good about yourself. If you want, there are great subreddits like or available which can help you sort out what's going on in your life.
Don't worry man, there are millions of redditors here to help!

When was the last dip and by how much?
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:01:06
I agree, it probably was delusional, but about a week ago, that was reality for bitcoin. Bitcoin isn't a currency right now, it's a commodity and will be treated as such, and clearly, if someone wants to be a market maker, they don't have to make a sizable investment in bitcoins to manipulate the market for their benefit
@_date: 2013-04-14 17:59:21
Thank you for that. It makes much more sense now! :)
@_date: 2013-04-12 15:00:47
Glad to know I'm not alone!! :) hah
@_date: 2013-04-11 13:51:02
hahah, Great Point!
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:16:10
hahahah that's hilarious...Yeah when it comes to technical analysis, who knows whats a good tool and not...
In my opinion volume is what drives prices up, volume will take a hit with bitcoin, and i probably won't break even for a while hah
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:46:49
Interesting, so in your opinion, would you say its quite possible that we could see a return to previous highs of $260 considering how popular bitcoin is becoming as a speculative instrument? And if so, what would your best guestamation be, % wise?
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:10:51
Great Point about it being a zero-sum game, all markets are like that, I can live with my losses as the money is for pure speculative purposes, 
@_date: 2013-04-11 13:56:55
Yep, it is all money I can afford to lose :)
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:18:48
I agree, volume is clearly what drives bitcoin price, i'm beginning to feel we're dealing with pokemon cards and beanie babbies
@_date: 2013-04-11 13:47:38
Yeah, I definitely have been and will continue to look at the charts.
I agree no one can tell me what to do...but there are pretty knowledgeable and financially savvy people here who understand market psychology, especially with technical analysis...If we're going to be serious about bitcoin, then we need to have constructive conversations about it and treat it as a financial instrument. I figured this would be a good way to begin that conversation

I couldn't agree more with you. Local news media outlets are only going to pick up the story thus piquing the interest of the common layman (cooks, hair stylists, librarians, etc), they'll throw in $50-100-1000 into it to see what happens...
If the money your using in bitcoins is just play money, then this could be an interesting ride
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:08:23
hah yes, I guess there are a lot of fallacies and contradictions in my post, definitely didn't think it through,
 the money I have in bitcoin is really for speculative purposes. 
@_date: 2013-04-14 17:58:58
Thank you for the info!
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:04:05
I most likely haven't been paying attention well enough, and have made mistakes...with that said, Im definitely ok with that knowing all the money I invested is money I can afford to lose
Do you have any experience with elliot wave theory?
@_date: 2013-04-12 18:41:05
basically, only two people win in this scenario then.... early adopters and Big institutions
@_date: 2013-04-11 13:22:34
have been following your advice as well, although keeping your reports free would be the most altruistic way for bitcoin to do well, I would appreciate if you do decide to make a subreddit, to please invite me as well. Thank you!
