Good news, even if it is just remedying a backwards situation.

Memory hole, mostly. People don't want to believe that a "prestigious" company is responsible for so many despicable things, despite it being plain ole history, and their actions are typically downplayed/obscured at the time such that it's practically not reported on.

Addendum: The Federal Reserve is a private institution.

I wish I could work on OpenBazaar full time. My background isn't heavy into crypto, though, so I'd probably have to take the bitch tasks if I were helping.
Edit: Dang, Python. The one language I haven't used much at all.

Yeah, but those risky investments have to be able to be offloaded to someone else. E.g., taxpayers.
That way places like GS take zero risk, and all the gain.

Well said, and totally spot on. Goldman Sachs being interested in Bitcoin is not good for people who actually want it to succeed, given GS' infamous reputation.

Guides for doing it? I don't personally necessarily need that, but it'd be helpful to have in the thread for archival purposes (i.e., someone searching this out later).

As far as I know, you're correct. 
Crypto isn't really my field, though, but it sounds like you could absolutely parallelize the search for each individual link.
If the individual links don't take that long for a single CPU, it wouldn't give much of a speedup, though (assuming a long chain).

It would be highly foolish to put any money or Bitcoin into an exchange run by them, given their reputation.

I hope it doesn't get there for a long time. GS' has a pretty notorious history of screwing up anything they touch (to their own massive profit, of course).
Not to say I don't want Bitcoin to get institutional investment.

I actually love the word bazaar, ever since I was a kid and someone used it in a novel, to help conjure up the image of a bustling open-air market. 
Always seemed like you could find anything at a real bazaar, and finding it would be an adventure. That's why I like it, I guess.
