Have you looked modeling around gradients of these factors?  Also, might be better to look for non-linear relationships, no?

What is outright wrong?

This is a very good pt.  How do you think it will impact price levels for BTC?  We try to do a lot of work on alternative data to see if we can find "relevant" relationships that help predict price changes.

Totally a fair pt.  That is an issue we have been struggling with when building our algorithms for BTC.  We are observing a linear relationship between price change the logarithmic moving averages for the change in transaction volume.  The problem we struggle with is how much of that is now noise vs. a relevant input.

Not sure we are following your question.  Are you asking us whether we know you can buy fractional amounts of BTC?

We are observing a linear relationship between price change the logarithmic moving averages for the change in transaction volume. But as we said above, the problem we struggle with is how much of that is now noise vs. a relevant input.  We plan on exploring looking at the differences of growth rates but there is the worry that we are getting lost too far in the weeds in the search for "correlated" alternative data.

We are politely telling them they are missing the point of the blog post?
@_date: 2018-03-08 00:45:59
Yes we know that.  Obviously, the English/grammar of the post is AWK.  We will fix that.

We are summarizing articles and talking points which are discussing the trend in this graph

It is meant to be a simple blog post summarizing trends in Bitcoin transactions the shift to Alt coins.

May want to consider whether your time series data is stationary when using neural networks.  We have done a lot of work with NN and have not found them useful with cryptocurrencies given the level of regime changes.
