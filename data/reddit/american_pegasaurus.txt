This old guy is an ass hole. Props to the guy being interviewed (ridiculed). This clip seems like it should be from 2012. We are past this 'laughing at us stage'.

Roll a dice over and over if you dont trust others code.

Here is a good ELI5 for you. There is a quote that goes something like this, "There are three types of minds. Feeble minds talk about other people. Good minds talk about events. Great minds talk about ideas." There is a reason Vitalik created something and there is a reason Peter seems to only criticize others.

Bitcoin has been mocked it's entire life. Nothing new.

TLDR: 15 paragraphs and no real specifics. Link to more specifics?

OP, this is what Luke does and you deserve a better answer and we deserve better information from our people of influence. Get your coins off an exchange to where you control the private key and sit tight. I guarantee you, even the most pro BTC person isn't complaining about doubling their coin count (albeit two different chains) and having the alt coin being worth $900 a week later. People here fight often about this and that and what chain is the best chain but quite frankly the future hasn't happened yet. Get your coins off and exchange and just chill.  IF there is a split, then you now have coins on both chains and who in the world wouldn't want that. It's the conservative play no matter what ideology you follow.

Murica elected Trump as president. Not all American's wanted Trump, but it is more important to have the ability to vote than it is to have your fav pres every 4 years. Bitcoins XT failed. Bitcoin Classic failed. What makes you think SegWit is any different? Just because Core supports it means it will be law? Nope
@_date: 2017-01-03 15:30:41
No this is very cool. Don't let people tell you otherwise. Thank you for sharing. As more and more time goes by, the stories of early adopters like you will replace the myth of Satoshi as he is obviously gone and not sharing his.

Does a Millenial need a safe space after an Internet stranger was mean?

Ask her to sell her makeup. If you are being asked to decrease your net wirth, she can too. Seems fair. ?

Nice detective work. At best, this is guilty by association propaganda. Seriously... By working for Roger or any company at all, employees don't have to give up their right to have their own opinions,hobbies, goals or pastimes.
@_date: 2016-11-24 17:13:29
I think this is called a taste of your own medecine. People have spent the last 2 years ridiculing r/btc for constantly complaining. Now who is doing the comaining? People like you who don't get their way. Kind of hypocritical don't you think? Stop acting like a spoiled Millenial. You won't always get your way and you aren't all knowing. 
@_date: 2016-12-04 05:22:12
Your being mean

This really could be a genius fail safe for if Hal's IP was ever compromised. IP Locators, which generally only get specific enough for the neighborhood level, could throw people off.

How do you buy things with your 401k?  You're missing the point.

You might not want to steer people to bitcoin core if you're claiming that Bitcoin can be used for remittances.

Only Peter Todd would still complain even when he get's what he wants.

Please elaborate. My understanding was that Zcash is mathematically anonymous and Monero is anonymous by combining transactions together.

So according to this data..... If a transaction were to cost $0.62 today, 11.9 million wallets wouldn't have enough funds to pay for a transaction. Great scaling. At least with fiat you can buy a $0.25 gum ball if you want. This makes me sad, frustrated, and angry.

Forgive me for being Captain Obvious, why don't you call your bank and stop the transaction instead of complaining to the internet?

Maybe this will help make a decision. I was in your shoes about a year ago.
I'm currently running 4 of the Yukons. They are joined to F2Pool.  The daily payout is currently 0.18.
Spondoolies lists the Yukon power consumption on their website.

Electricity is free in my situation so I have never had to do much electrical mathing. 
So you could be earning 0.045 per miner per day with each SP35 *before* an electrical cost. There are also a lot of new miners coming online now so that will be dipping in the near future.

Back when the internet was young there was the issue of not being able to find anything.  Larry and Sergey's solution was to index the internet. In your own words, it was a solution to a problem that most people didn't have because most people didn't use the internet then. 
@_date: 2015-10-09 07:17:36
I came here to say the exact same thing. It's astounding how the media's perception is shifting. 6 months, a year ago..  The interviewer would have been sneering and laughing.

I did a search for Alien Segwit2x but I can't find anything on the Google. I also scrolled through the top 100 cryptos but am not seeing it either. Did you maybe just mean Segwit2x? I did find some search hits for that. Thanks !!!!

Roger has been transparent with the sites budget and it's purpose. He's also been quite open and responsive to constructive criticizm. More power to him for being deeply involved. Also, he's not the only one. Mods modding multiple sites. Blockstream and core devs.  When you care you get involved however you can. Stop armchair quarterbacking and find your own way to get involved instead of complaining. No one likes complainers.

Wow. Logged in just to say thanks for that link. It looks like a great one to add to the collection.

You just reiterated my point for me. You don't see  bitcoin's worth much like people didn't see the purpose of saving the internet at that time.

Curious if others find the Brave for Android UI appaling? I dislike it. Can't seem to do simple things like paste a URL. The PC version I have been enjoying though.
