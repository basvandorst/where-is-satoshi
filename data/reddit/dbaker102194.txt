I have used Nexchange, Changelly and Shapeshift. Nexchange always has the best rates. Sorry to hear this, hope you guys work it out soon. On a side note, perhaps you should limit the amount of $$$ a person can convert. Who the hell tries to convert $1mill without using a proper exchange unless he has something to hide??? All proper exchanges demand KYC and by using services like Shapeshift, the guy sending $1mill in BTC would be paying a massive amount of fees to prevent being KYCed.

I've heard rumors that 27000x top of the line ASIC boxes will launch near fork date to support 2X. Does anyone believe this or is it just scare tactics?

**I finally found the link where you can submit a comment for the ETF proposal.**
1. Goto: [
2. Search for "34-83520"
3. Click on "Submit Comments on SR-CboeBZX-2018-040"
4. Submit your feedback. Your feedback will become public information.
Guidelines: When constructing your public comment, think in terms of how it would benefit a US investor. For example, an ETF would allow non-techie investors participation in one of the most innovative technologies since the Internet and how it solves the problem of allowing US residents to hold BTC, without having the risk of being hacked, e.g. custody issues, etc.
Lets do this guys! If **Bitcoin ETF gets approved, we will be looking at the biggest crypto bullrun ever.**
