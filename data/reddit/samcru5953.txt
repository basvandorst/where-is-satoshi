Well, it is actually a sunk cost. Read the wiki page on sunk costs. And, you can't sell college credits. They are non-marketable

Everybody gets some of their Gox holdings? Mark Karpeles commits suicide? Either would be bullish.

So, you would rather accept false promises that alter risk taking behavior than have there be no illusions? Also, I am not aware of any crypto exchange that has a "fuck it, do whatever you want" policy.

Because financial regulations are enforced and stuff, and the U.S. dollar has been able to retain a whopping 4% of its value. What would we do without the regulators?
@_date: 2014-02-27 02:15:40
Yes, I agree. The USD should be regulated to prevent harm from coming to hard working Americans. In the meantime, buy more BTC!

Will a $TBTF bite the dust? Do you care?

I assume that the volume could be handled. Bitfinex is based in Hong Kong, and I can trade there no problem even though I don't live in Hong Kong.

Don't ask questions. Just sell!

The Bitcoin Foundation is and will continue to be a practical irrelevancy regardless of who is or is not on the board.

Keep dreaming...

How can you believe that petitioning a politician will make a difference? It's just as futile as voting. These types of stunts are just how the politicians get attention. Bitcoin will eventually be outlawed if it cannot be controlled because it is a threat to the money masters. Just accept this fact and move on. Sending letters, making phone calls, and pleading with the overlords will only make you look foolish and pathetic. Please don't embarrass yourself. They don't care what you think. They never have, and they never will. Just ignore them and keep dumping your dollars for BTC.

I cancelled my subscription to the WSJ over one year ago because the reporting was so bad. Their misrepresentative reporting isn't new or unique to BTC.

"Personally, I had over 550 BTC in Gox. I will never get any of that back."
I don't think this will end up being true. Mt. Gox will receive a private bailout and you will receive a portion of the BTC that you had. That is my prediction. Of course, I have no insider information. This is just speculation on my part.

I exclusively use Bitfinex, but there is a relatively low volume of LTC and an even lower volume of the LTCBTC pair.

If you don't think insider trading and fraud is rampant in the mainstream financial sector then you are a fool.

I want the Feds to try just so that we can all have a good laugh at how ineffective and irrelevant the politicians have become. These jokers are so consumed by hubris that it has become comical. Their Bitcoin regulations will be as effective as all of their other regulations which means not effective at all. Keep dumping your USD.
@_date: 2014-02-27 02:58:12
This is a better hypothesis: 
@_date: 2014-02-25 08:31:30
Yes. If they believe that continuing college will yield no return on their investment.

Donating BTC to politicians is counterintuitive.
@_date: 2014-02-27 07:23:15
I'm down a couple hundred dollars (which is tiny compared to what others have lost) because of Mark Karpeles' lies and deception. I wonder how much of the price decline was as a result of his arbitrage scheme? I remember when a very suspicious multi-thousand BTC whale trade came in and dumped around $590/BTC on Feb 23. Was that the Karpeles whale I wonder?

I'm in a short position so the price is bound to go to $10k any day now.
@_date: 2014-03-01 05:30:38
Because it is the best exchange out there.
