Yes, technically, you could solve this particular problem, but the reality i that this is only one problem in a very broad category of unwanted software. This is the only practical way an AV could take care of this problem.

lol wat?
I did not read that part. That's fucked up. Like really really fucked up. While I do have a point (okay, half a point), it's obvious that what AVG is doing is dishonest. They just added it to get better ratings, not to stop Trojans. Capitalism hard at work.

At least he's not a sociopath.

I still think it's malicious because it doesn't have a proper template. There is a lot of software that is potentially unwanted (like key generators, you don't want that shit on a company computer) and I know most of it is classified as Trojan. They're making everything appear to be as bad as possible on purpose, don't tell me they didn't think well about the category/template for these programs.

There is logic, as I originally said in the first few comments. I think it's reasonable to say BTC apps are unwanted because they're often installed by Trojans. What's not reasonable is to say the app its self is a threat as big as they make it.  So if they don't have that category, they should make it! And they should explain what kind of apps it contains. Something like "these are not viruses but they are often installed by viruses, so if you did not specifically install this, you may have a virus" should have been enough. There's a big difference between "probably a virus" and "a malicious application that allows hackers to remotely access you computer system letting them modify files".

Maybe you're expecting your AV to do magic, but there is simply now way the AV can know if you really want to use something or if it's there by accident (trojan), and given that most installations are trojans they took the logical way.
So you're doing it wrong. You shouldn't trust your AV to keep you safe. You should trust your AV to do its best to keep generally unwanted programs off your computer.

I don't understand anything. That site stole my scroll, so I can't position information how I like it, and some "pages" are bright while others are dark. I closed it a minute ago and I feel like my eyes still hurt. So, yeah, I don't understand what I'd use this for because I still have no idea what it's about. Whoever designed that should be publicly executed.
