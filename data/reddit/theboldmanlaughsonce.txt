Well, I've been a member of several exchanges and been on several trading desks around the world. A liquidity hole would most likely come up in the case of a derivatives desk. Regardless, I've never heard of a stack. Just an order book. But I haven't been everywhere.

Wow.  That was kind of hostile.  I don't know of people referring it to the offer stack... but I knew what you meant.  
People do speak of a "liquidity hole" (coined by Nassim Taleb) which can occur on either side of the market.  That means more than just a large spread.  It could be several percent above the current market, but it exists nevertheless.

Well, except for karma.

The one rule I do my best to instill in my students is, "You'll always find a reason to hate yourself."
I suggest that if they have an inclination to sell, but lack conviction, sell 1/2 their position and pick a 'random' hour/day/month to sell their other 1/2.  One of those sales will be better than the other (almost always).  But in the time that you've halved your risk you will have 1/2 that is going your way.

How about approaching him as an adult?

Sydney is absolutely consequential.

You mean Sydney or Wellington.  Or the Saudi or other ME markets that are open over the weekend.

There are no exchanges for FX trading. It's an OTC market.

You guys are killing me.  Sydney is the primary source of raw materials into the manufacturing giant, China.  They are the first gold spot market to open in any week.
