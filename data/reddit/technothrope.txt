Show me a Soldier who WANTS to fight a war, and I'll show you a Soldier about to get a Section 8. No sane person wants to fight a war. But sometimes, the only way to defend yourself, your society, and your ideals, is violence. Deadly violence, delivered swiftly and without mercy.

Um, isn't one of the points of cryptocurrency to allow anyone to make a secure currency transmission to anyone else? How does this not attack the very concept of Bitcoin?

My point here is, how do you propose an AnCap society defend itself against an authoritarian fiat-currency society with a large-scale MI-complex? OPSEC is not just a phrase. If your society is engaged in a military conflict with another society, there must be secrecy, or your enemies will simply overwhelm you. There are always going to be aspects of military operations that cannot be both effective and publically known.

Then what will you call a economy so flush with materials, and with 90+% recycling effeciency on raw materials, that the 'standard' level of wealth would make Bill Gates blush? When what really matters is the manufacturing capability and designs you have access to, not who sells finished products to you?

It looks to me like Massimino thinks we can end war by dismantling militaries. He's likelier to find a unicorn that wants to have his babies. Humans are highly competitive animals. Some of them are always going to be willing to get what they want by taking it from other humans. Others are going to want to impose their tyranny over others, and will be willing to use whatever force is necessary to do so. Unless the society you live in is willing and able to defend itself, it will perish. If a functional, independent ancap society with a post-scarcity economy arises in my lifetime, I will join it. And if there isn't a company offering military services, I will bloody well start one myself. Because otherwise, some authoritarian state with an intact military-industrial complex is going to stomp all over us.
