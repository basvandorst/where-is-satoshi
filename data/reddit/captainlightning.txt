Bought a pair of these ages ago and I've yet to come across another pair anywhere near as comfortable since, alpaca or otherwise.
I realized one day that I should stock up on these things just in case, but by then it was too late and they were already shut down :(
Really wish they would come back, I've spent hundreds of dollars now trying to find a pair of socks that were half as good.

The right moment is every moment. Rain or shine, hot or cold.
Put them on and revel in knowing that you have reached a higher plane of being.

You say that updating warrant canaries regularly is a bad thing, but you don't really explain why in either comment.
If the point of a warrant canary is that you update it until you can't, how could a user possibly know without viewing the source code whether or not the canary has been triggered and the source compromised?
You say that it's bad and unsustainable, but why? There is zero downside I can think of to updating a warrant canary regularly to keep people aware of the project's current status.
If you've been given a warrant and told not to update the canary, how would a user be able to tell the difference between a negligent dev and legitimately rooted software?

12.50$? I could wash a car for more than that.
Whoops! I thought you meant you were offering 12.50$ for someone to code something similar for Reddit. Either way, from your other responses 12.50$ is only enough to cover maybe 1/2 of the cost of the hosting (for one month)  you would need to run this.

I'll take it the 2 bitcoins will be a recurring payment?

Then why do you expect someone to take you up on this deal? Do you plan to only run it for a month?
