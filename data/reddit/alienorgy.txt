Anyone that has a ledger nano s know how the custom fees work as in how many satoshis per byte means how fast the transaction will take?

I was setting up my ledger nano s and went to download the chrome apps when it said I needed the latest a version of chrome that's 50+. Apparently my cpu is a dinosaur and it says windows xp and vista are no longer supported. Is there a way around this? I have a mac laptop but when I downloaded chrome yesterday it completed but a place to open chrome was nowhere to be found.

I got it I typed in wrong the first time thank you though. I had that option to scan but didn't know how. Dk why I couldn't copy the address from ledger

I got chrome working! Now just having trouble getting my funds over to ledger. Its saying from my current wallet that I'm typing (my ledger number won't copy) an invalid btc adress. I picked segwit btw

Any resume time estimate from coinbase?
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:15:38
The ledger itself can't be set up with internet explorer right?

I have a MacBook air laptop without chrome and I tried t downloadit twice already. It finished but the app is nowhere to be found. It says to finish setting up download the all for phone and tablet too. I already got it on my phone and dont see how downloading on a tablet is going to get it working on this laptop.

Are the hardware wallets Ledger and Trezor 100% secure? If not then what would make them not and is there a way to make it so they're unhackable? Also are at least 1 of them comparable with any smart phone that has a usb port? 
@_date: 2017-11-20 14:45:35
Okay thanks I appreciate it.
@_date: 2017-11-21 23:11:10
One last question. You can use multiple devices for your wallet right?
@_date: 2017-11-20 21:40:24
If I'm ordering a Ledger or Trezor is it worth buying a 2 year data recovery plan? 
@_date: 2017-11-20 21:42:04
Hey so just to clarify it can work on any smartphone with usb port right? Also if your phone breaks you're not screwed right?

Thanks so much. Do you mind sending the correct link to ledgor, and electrum there are a lot of fakes out there.
