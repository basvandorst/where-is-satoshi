Both bitcoin and gold are more or less pyramid schemes.
But gold is much less of a pyramid scheme for only one reason - you can not replace it in production with anything else.
While bitcoin can be easily replaced by other altcoins.

It turns out that he did not run potentially dangerous coin daemons in separate VM not because he is stupid but because he is smart.  
And running them under root account was brilliant idea.  
Also he kept 13k btc on a hot wallet instead of a cold one not because he is a moron but because he is f**ing genius !

No need to be a security expert to understand simple things:
1. Keeping 13k btc on a hot wallet is absolutely insane. 
2. Even if you run everything on one server, executing potentially dangerous coin daemons under different users which do not have privileges to access other files of the server would've reduce the chance of attack to minimum.  
3. Coin daemons can even run on separate Virtual Machines to reduce possibility of attack to zero.  
I believe that those facts are so simple even for non-security experts so I'm wondering why there are people who believe  bullshit he is talking about.
