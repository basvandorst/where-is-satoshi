You could get that kind of return if you use a lot of leverage. $100 can get you 5000 Bitmex XBTUSD contracts, which is the equivalent of 8.72 bitcoins at the price quoted. If OP held these until the price reached $773.69, those 5000 contracts would be worth $6746, so he could sell them for $1746 profit (minus various fees).
The problem is that if the price drops just $10 to $565, your position would be liquidated, and you'd lose all of your $100. Or the exchange could get hacked, perform an exit scam, or use dodgy accounting, and you'd lose the lot anyway.

Yes, this is the rule. It's simple mathematics.
Let's say the volume-adjusted average Bitcoin price for the last 12 months is 8k. That means that each 12.5 btc block for the last 12 months $100 000 in new money has been invested in Bitcoin. 
    8000 x 12.5 = 100 000
This is what's needed each block to keep the price averaging 8k. If there's less invested, the price dips. If there's more, it booms.
So what happens when the 12.5 bitcoins per block halves to 6.75? There's no reason for the 100 thousand to suddenly halve to balance it out. The only number with any flexibility is the price.
So rewriting that equation:
    100_000 / 12.5 = 8000 (today)
    100_000 / 6.75 = 16000 (May 2020)
But if the price doubles, the media attention increases, and the 100 thousand/block increases. And because this is a reliable, predictable rule, the price will go up *before* the halving. 
Not only is the rule clearly written in code, we have precedent.

I've looked at interledger, the Ripple protocol which R3 is apparently interested in, and I can't see a block nor a chain. I'm happy that banks are catching up on 30 years of cryptography, and if they can actually find a way to streamline international finance, they will have solved a lot of political problems in the process. 
Of course, lots of IT projects start off ambitiously "we're going to solve problem P by using technology W, X, Y and Z" and then end up humbly "we solved some of your P problems, and we used technology Z and S".

At its simplest, TA is using past price to predict the future price. Claiming it's all bullshit is equivalent to claiming past price has *no relationship at all* to the future price.

Even years after the web became popular, "branded browsers" were used to create a walled garden. ISPs would give you a CD with the network software, and a branded browser pre-filled with bookmarks. It would be difficult/impossible to install the ISPs configuration without getting the branded browser too. The browsers homepage was a "portal" run by the ISP which relied on news and weather feeds and showed ads from the ISP (like yahoo.com today). 
Later developments included the ISP's proxy warning you when you requested a site outside the garden, because it "might not be compatible with your configuration and may contain dangerous links". Sometimes the ISPs browser would intentionally render external sites incorrectly, or inject html into external sites. If you had a support problem, you would have to use their browser to submit a request.

I think you're understating it - it's colossal, and probably far ahead of its time. It looks to me like you need to solve profound philosophical problems first, such as defining "truth" and finding an objective basis for ethics. Then you have to deal with a justice system which appears to be structured to be as conservative as possible, and where progress generally only happens when judges die. Again: good luck with that.

The World Bank described Bitcoin as a "naturally occurring ponzi," and while I think that's an oxymoron, it does explain some of this behaviour. Increased adoption drives the price up, so holders have an economic incentive to spread the word. The real problem is that the brigaders don't know when they've gone too far, and are doing more harm than good. This is then compounded by buttcoiners, who *pretend* to be Bitcoin brigaders, damaging the reputation of Bitcoiners even more.

There's two questions here, one about Bitcoin itself, and another about someone stealing your bitcoins.


Many have tried. The total value of all bitcoins is roughly $3.5 billion US, so there is a lot of incentive to break it. Have you ever installed a security system on a $3.5 billion boat? Bitcoin is based on well-tested cryptography, of the same kind used by the military and by banks. There are certain protections built in, which mean that if you don't reuse addresses, even flaws in the encryption won't allow people to steal bitcoins. Bitcoin itself is very secure.


This actually happens a lot :( 
There's even a subreddit about it (lots of schadenfreude). Because Bitcoin can be used anonymously, thieves find it very worthwhile stealing them from personal computers.
Computer security isn't easy. If you're not confident about keeping top-secret documents on your computer, you shouldn't keep bitcoins on it either. One solution is to buy specialized hardware to store your bitcoins, like a Trezor, Mycelium Entropy, or Ledger Wallet. Ledger Wallet only costs about $20, and is very secure. You can also print out "paper wallets" for free.

If blocking ports lowers the value enough, a point will come when the miners can't defend themselves from 51% attacks. A successful 51% attack can choose which transactions to include in blocks, so they can make the network literally worthless. So an international political attack followed by a sustained technical attack could make Bitcoin unusable. It could theoretically have value, but you'd probably have to base your price on casascius coins.

Thank you **so much** for that. I'm going to come back and re-read it for days.
You explained where my analogy falls down so thoroughly when you said "this isn't pieces of pizza". You're right. That's the difference. That's the *only* difference between my analogy and Bitcoin.
Here's what **you** are misunderstanding: 
1. There's x Bitcoin. It doesn't matter. 
2. I exchange dollars for n/x of them. 
3. The decimal place moves somewhere. There are now 100X Bitcoin
4. I now have 100n/100x of them. That's *the same* as n/x!
You see, the only thing that affects the value my bitcoins, is what *proportion* of the total bitcoins they represent. Look at my example with eliminating Canadian pennies again, it's very similar. One day you have $1 divisible into 100 pennies. The next day you have $1 divisible into 20 5-cent pieces. Nothing has changed. Someone else mentioned measuring gold in grams or micrograms. same again.

The big old addresses are one of the greatest unknowns in bitcoin (somewhat defeating the purpose of the predictable inflation rate). To a large degree, users are simply hoping that nobody intentionally crashes the market like this. 
However this problem isn't unique to Bitcoin: Bill Gates could dump all his Microsoft shares and crash the MSFT price too. Some people are even hoping for this: If you look at the order books on some exchanges you will see buy bids at $5 per bitcoin, in case someone tanks the market in this way.

OTOH, I wouldn't borrow a BTC denominated loan. If I ended up unable to pay debt for 0.5 btc now, my lenders would probably shrug and ignore it. But if one bitcoin becomes worth $100,000, those lenders will be very motivated to get their 0.5 btc back!

Usually an ISP filter will only block *incoming* traffic on a port, but even if they blocked both, there's no reason why someone couldn't set up a node on port 80 - the standard http port. ISPs blocking outgoing traffic to port 80 aren't going to be very popular, since their customers couldn't get on Google any more. It just wouldn't be the Internet as people know it. Even then, it *still* wouldn't work 100%, because people can use tunnelling/VPNs. 
As jonf3n mentioned, you can get the initial bootstrap node from any other source: Facebook, word of mouth, morse tapped on the pipes, or hobo glyphs. If you still couldn't get the bootstrap node, and had sufficient resources/time, you could even run a port-scan - although that would be pretty desperate.

The maximum number of transactions per second (block sizes) are intentionally limited to keep running a Bitcoin node practical for home users.

I wish you luck, those are issues that Bitcoin doesn't have, and they're actually the reason lots of people like Bitcoin. 
Admittedly it's all based on one big assumption: Bitcoin can't be stopped. But if you swallow that, if that assumption is true, Bitcoin transactions become a force of nature. The liability clearly stops at the entity submitting the transaction because nobody can stop the network. You can censure people for using Bitcoin, but you can't lock up Bitcoin itself. "Smart contracts" lacking that certainty remain chained down to dumb courts. Not quite pointless, but redundant next to their unconstrained counterparts.

Lets be honest; it's not in the same ballpark. 24 words written down somewhere in a small apartment are orders of magnitude easier to hide. You don't even need to access them unless it's an emergency, so you could put half under the piano and half inside a leg of lamb in the deep freeze. Forget loose floor-boards: glue that backup shut! 99% of burglars aren't even going to recognise an HD seed if they look straight at it. You *could* even memorise them and leave the thief (but potentially your widow) with absolutely zero.

One of Bitcoins purposes (and selling points) is to be a store of wealth. If you're comparing the price of a bitcoin with a currency (such as USD) which is designed to lose value over time (price inflation), then you would expect the value of the bitcoin to go up. 
Put another way, if the value of a bitcoin fails to increase by the same amount as inflation, Bitcoin isn't working the way it was designed.

I don't use bitcoin-qt much, but I don't think it uses a password by default (so the wallet.dat is not encrypted). This means if your wallet.dat (on your laptop or usb stick) is stolen underway, your wallet could be emptied.
If you do set it up with a password, then yes, you need to enter that password on the laptop when you are away from home.
A common mistake is not encrypting (or encrypting with a weak password), and putting the wallet.dat on a cloud storage, like dropbox. Your wallet.dat contains your private keys, so you need to protect it.

If the price were to remain stable for a while, it would be more likely to attract new hoarders - particularly those who currently use weak currencies (Ukraine, Venezuela et). As long as the price keeps dropping, few people are interested in increasing their investment, so the price keeps dropping.
It will stop somewhere, I can guarantee it! Once it reaches $0.00002 I will personally buy all the bitcoins.

When did you lose track? Here's a very quick summary of the last six months:
* US Marshalls auctioned 30,000 bitcoins and will auction 50,000 more next week
* Mining pools are much more diverse 
* Price is fairly stable in the last months after dropping for most of the year
* Number of transactions has been increasing all year and is now at an all-time-high
* Satoshi's identity is still not known, despite claims one of his accounts was hacked
* Fixes for scalability and 0-conf transactions have progressed some
* Venture Capital funding has been huge this year
* Many new exchanges and ATMs and other services launched
* Regulated financial products are still "on the way"
* Ecuador banned Bitcoin - planning their own cryptocurrency. Dominica announced a Bitcoin-drop in 2015
* MIT Bitcoin-drop started handing out money
* Some big-name Bitcoin adopters: Dell, Newegg, Expedia, Wikipedia and the Red Cross
* "bits" started to become the standard unit
* No criminal charges arose from MtGox, and creditors still don't have their coins. Same with Neo+Bee.

They also let developers experiment with different ideas, see what problems arise, and try to solve those problems. 
For example, dogecoin is much faster than Bitcoin, but that means that the blockchain also grows faster. The dogecoin developers will probably have to find a solution to the ballooning blockchain long before bitcoin, so whatever solution they find, bitcoin developers will know whether it worked.

I like to experiment, so I use lots.
I use Mycelium as my main wallet, and Kraken as my main exchange, but I have a heap of others installed on various devices, a hardware wallet, some paper wallets, an offline laptop with Electrum for secure stuff, a brain wallet, and accounts with about 10 different exchanges. I don't actually have very many coins (2 digits), so I have to maintain a spreadsheet to keep track of where they all are, and a password manager to keep track of logins, but even if someone got access to the password db, they couldn't steal more than about 2% of my coins, thanks to 2FA. 
I also have a few alt-coin wallets, including some dregs of doge, ltc, ppc and nmc.

I thought you understood it better than that. The price can rise with almost no further investment. If all the sellers cancelled orders less than $3000, then as soon as someone bought a fraction of a coin at that price, that would be the price.  By the same logic, the price is perfectly stable if nobody bought and nobody sold. Zero pumping required.

There's an entire branch of mathematics called "probability", very closely related to statistics. 
Small amounts of "luck" cancel out over many iterations. Roll a die five times and calculate the average. It will probably won't be one or six, but it could very easily be less than two or more than five. Now roll the die 10,000 times, and the average will almost certainly be between 3.4 and 3.6 . Roll it 10,000,000 times and I will confidently bet you 10 bitcoins that the average will be between 3.49 and 3.51.

* Having seperate devices for things isn't such a bad idea, if your focus isn't portability.

There's a few reasons why bitcoins may be "worth it" apart from speculation and bad national currency:
**Capital flight** The Chinese Yuan, for example, is not a weak currency, but it is difficult to legally move large sums out of China. Some of the wealthier Chinese are preparing for the day they may need to leave the country by hoarding Bitcoins
**Anonymity** Yes, some people use Bitcoin for guns, drugs and child pornography.
**curiosity** Some people are just fascinated by the technology, and want to play with it to understand it
**Lack of credit cards** Credit cards are not as common outside the USA. For some people Bitcoin is the best way to pay online
**P2P** Some people accept Bitcoin payments from friends or family for settling small debts
**B2B** Bitcoin has significant advantages for merchants (no chargebacks and no fees), but merchants who have received bitcoin as payment may want to use it directly instead of paying to have it exchanged.
**Ideology** Some people feel that using fiat is tacitly supporting the policies of their government.
**Hiding assets** for tax or from a spouse.

I'm very sorry if I'm confusing you, but yes, that is how markets work. The last price is the reference price, and this stays the price until another trade happens. 
You can see this for yourself on a low-volume exchange like bitcurex (Poland). Sometimes the price won't change for hours, beause everyone with Zloty to trade is asleep. You can also see it on Bitcoinwisdom's Mtgox or Mintpal prices. No trades = no price change. Not zero.

If you want to accept donations via the web, you can use Bitpay or just add a qr-code to your page (like  ~~does~~ used to do).

Thanks for the suggestion, but I don't think the Finney attack has anything to do with Bitundo. The Finney attack requires knowing in advance which address you plan to use for the double-spend. Bitundo can't be continually generating blocks for every address, on the off-chance that someone with one of those addresses will want to double-spend. The Finney attack is expensive already, but extending it to arbitrary addresses is practically impossible.

What you probably want is a volume weighted average, such that if 9 bitcoins were sold for $600 and 1 bitcoin were sold for $700, the average on that date would be $610. What most of the sites offer is a "closing" value. The idea of a closing value doesn't apply well to Bitcoin, because it's a 24h market (but that hasn't stopped it from being applied to other currencies which are traded 24h). The closing value is an arbitrary trade in the 24h you're interested in.
You can get the volume weighted price for a single day on a single market using Bitcoinwisdom. I don't know any way of getting weighted historical data for an index without compiling it yourself. Here are the instructions for Bitcoinwisdom:
1. Go to  
2. Select a market. More volume is usually better.
3. Click on Settings and select chart-style: "line-o" (Try "line" too, you might prefer it)
4. Click on settings again and select line-style: "volume weighted"
5. Find the date you're interested in. The date you're pointint to can be seen in the top left of the chart area, and the volume weighted price floats in a 
little black tag.
6. If you can scroll back to the date you want, you have to zoom out by selecting a different "time interval", 1d should do the trick.

* Integration with another PoS like visa? Eg Mycelium wallet generates single-use credit card numbers like Apple Pay?
* App generates a "virtual paper wallet" filled with the correct funds, encrypted with a key only known to the merchant?

Of course increased merchant adoption brings increased selling pressure, but it also increases the usefulness of bitcoins. To demonstrate, imagine I offered you the choice between:
**1.** A $10 gift voucher valid at the Grass Hill Alpaca sock shop    
**2.** A $10 gift voucher valid at the Grass Hill Alpaca sock shop  and Overstock and Newegg and takeaway.com and Microsoft and Dell and 100,000 other shops internationally.
It's pretty easy to see that the gift voucher  is better. Even though both vouchers have the nominal value of $10, the second one is *worth more* because of it's increased utility.
So yes, Microsoft accepting bitcoin is actually good news.

and Kuwait—also U.S. military protectorates. When Saddam Hussein made the bold move of singlehandedly switching from the dollar to the euro in 2000, followed by Iran in 2001, this was quickly followed by American bombing and military occupation. ^14
How much Hussein’s decision to buck the dollar really weighed into the U.S. decision to depose him is impossible to know, but no country in a position to make a similar switch can ignore the possibility.

In a transaction where Alice pays Bob &lt;x&gt; coins, the "days destroyed" is the number of coins "x" mulitplied by the number of days since they were previously moved (or generated). The very first Bitcoin block was generated on the 3rd of January 2009, which is 2110 days ago today. If someone moved the fifty coin block reward today, the "days destroyed" would be 50 x 2110 = 15,500 days destroyed.

You're not going to get anywhere with a death certificate on blockchain.info, they don't have copies of the private keys. If you can't find them, then the money is truly gone. Set up your own blockchain account to see how it works (on another computer). You'll see what the backup key looks like, so you know what to look for.

I would focus on *blockchain* and *cryptocurrency*, and only use the word "Bitcoin" if it helps provide context. Most of the people who've heard of Bitcoin still have an emotional reaction to it, but "blockchain" is seen as a more netural term.  The question should be phrased in terms of disruptive technology, trends and strategy. You can provoke an answer by begging the question such as "What is the company's strategy on distruptive technologies based on blockchains, such as {Bitcoin and other} cryptocurrencies?"
Your CEO will be most concerned with addressing shareholders who might be present, and the words "disruptive technology" should ring alarm bells, and make it hard to fob the question off. On the other hand, he probably doesn't know the first thing about it, so don't actually expect this to acheive any more than put it on his radar.

No, because transactions with invalid nLockTimes aren't accepted into the mempool. The idea is that you send someone a transaction valid at 1pm, then you can send updates to the transaction up until 1pm, at which point they broadcast it to the network.

Can ghash build a private chain? I don't know how the miners who rent their equipment to ghash configure it, but I would assume that they broadcast blocks outside the pool, and ghash can't control that.
I think the private chain risk is only in cases where the pool has full control over the mining hardware.

Try to picture this: a huge conference with representatives of all the banks, small and large, from all over the world, all trying to agree exactly which of them should have *how much* control? I don't think there's any threat of this happening in the next ten years.
The only alternative is a completely open and free currency, which *none* of the banks control. A currency controlled by mathematical limits set when it was created. This is what we have. In fact, we already have a few hundred different varieties. What would be the point in trying to do it again from scratch?

Wouldn't NFC transactions make this largely ineffective? In an NFC transaction, the customer doesn't broadcast their own transaction on the network, rather send the signed transaction to the retailer over NFC, and the retailer broadcasts it. The further and faster he broadcasts it, the harder it will be to double-spend. In this case the motivation to broadcast the transaction and to receive the money are no longer at odds.

Kudos should also go to for making it easy to admit I was wrong. When someone responds "You're an idiot and you know nothing" the natural reaction is to double-down. Believing false things leads to making bad decisions, and that leads to losing money, so just saved me money.

Mining does two things: it processes transactions and gives you a chance to win free Bitcoin. Currently you can't win enough to make a profit. So mining helps secure the network by confirming transactions.
I think when Aussiehash says "fun" he means it's fun to learn how it works and try it out. It can also be fun to imagine you will win the prize.
I think you might get better information if you pose close-ended questions. It's difficult to answer open ended questions like "I don't understand" without going on for pages. Bitcoin was designed to work like gold for the Internet. What questions do you have about that?

It's risky and unnecessarily complex to do this as a contract. There's no standard way of importing/exporting transactions, and the transaction would have to be saved on some medium somewhere, along with the recipients private key.

Have a look at the remittances report produced by the Wolrd Bank in March this year. In the most extreme case, Nepal, 50% of their GDP came from Remittances, and the average cost was also 50%.

I think this is a bad scenario. This would clearly indicate that adoption is not increasing. Even a modest increase, for example, 2% per year (which, I know, would be undetectable with the current volatility), would be much better.
OTOH, if lots of very old coins started moving, and the price stayed at $300-$400, it would indicate a healthy redistribution of coins, and would be a good long-term indicator.

This is really good work - gilded. I hope there will be more collected overviews of the pros and cons like this. Maybe we could collect each developers opinion of how the 20MB proposal would affect different kinds of Bitcoin users: merchants, investors, developers, node operators etc. Or maybe we could organize a survey where they each comment on possible risk scenarios.
My opinion is that a fixed 1MB limit wasn't a core promise of Bitcoin, so ideologues that insist on it should start their own altcoin. Software development always takes longer than planned, so some kind of temporary fix is needed very soon.

Yes, the "Bitcoin will simply copy the idea" has been pretty well debunked by the blocksize-increase debate.

That sounds plausible, but I'm thinking that historical transaction fees could effectively be a kind of proof-of-stake. I'm just throwing around ideas here, but what if the max block size were based on the proportional size of fees to transaction amount in the last 100 blocks? Surely a sybil-attack on that would be very expensive, and could only force the block size in one direction temporarily. An additional protection could come from making the block-size adjustment occur randomly - it only happens when the nonce meets a certain criteria. Attacking would be very high-risk.

What there were "premium" bitcoind, where nodes only shared transactions with the top 10% of fees. Miners could choose to connect some of their machines to one of these nodes, and if rest of the network started to fail, the premium nodes would keep sharing the bets 10% to the premium miners, so only these transactions would be confirmed.

Here's a few scenarios that might play out in a conflict:
1. **Developers release an "unofficial" version which is compatible with the "official" Bitcoin** (There's no real official version, but there are developers with a higher profile who are defacto authorities). Some people will update, some won't. If the changes don't break anything, it won't matter. If the changes are popular, they'll probably be included in the official version in the next release.
2. **Developers release a new version of Bitcoin with new rules for validating transactions.** Some miners update to this version, and mine some blocks on it. These blocks aren't accepted by all miners, so you end up with a blockchain fork (also called a hard fork). If you have bitcoins on one fork, they are also on the other, but any transactions made after the fork are only valid on one side. You will only be able to sell them on an exchange which supports your fork. The value of Bitcoin will be diveded between the forks. The total value would probably fall a lot if the split were near 50%, but if only 0.01% of people used the new version, it wouldn't have much impact.
3. **Devlopers release an update with a new mining algorithm and a completely new blockchain.** This is effectively a new coin, although someone may decide to keep the old blockchain. It's like Dogecoin, Peercoin or Litecoin. It shouldn't be called Bitcoin, and it probably wont. Its value starts at zero.

I think you're missing the important point about the *competition* between miners. Every miner that capitulates, and switches off his machines, increases the income of all the remaining miners, giving them more reason to stay in the game! The result is always that the least efficient miners are culled.
There's also a positive feedback from the slower block times: fewer new bitcoins come on the market each hour. Supply drops. Price = demand/supply. Assuming most of those coins are being bought by speculators rather than users, demand won't be affected much by temporarily slower confirmations, but supply will.


I will personally mine all the Bitcoins on my laptop when it's possible. I'm not the only one to have made that claim. Bitcoin bootstrapped itself into the current situation from such beginnings. There is clearly a bottom to the spiral, so the real question is, where is the bottom? I think it's lower than $232, but I don't claim to know where it is.

I'm going to assume it's an honest question, and you don't really know very much about Bitcoin.
If the miners all stopped mining at once, Bitcoin would stop. I could then start mining with my laptop, but the difficulty would be so high that it would take years to mine a block. Someone (for example myself), would probably fork to make difficulty adjust a bit more quickly, and then bitcoin could be mined on laptops and phones again.
If, slightly more realisitically, all miners turned off the least efficient half of their hardware, the hash rate would probably drop by about 25%. Confirmations would all take a bit longer for a few days, then everything would return to normal, Bitcoin would keep working as before, and miners would be getting the same income with lower expenditure, so they'd get higher profits. 
The first miner to start switching his hardware back on would start getting a greater share of the profits, and the hashrate would climb back up.

@_date: 2015-01-19 08:54:20
Still looks like the hashrate is very stable. Current projections are for a -1.42% adjustment on about Jan 26th. That's slightly larger than the -1.37% in December, but the +8.2% on Jan 12th was also pretty large.
I'm pretty sure we're partly covered by the fact that it's Northern hemisphere winter, so miners cooling costs are lower. If this price drop had occurred in Summer, the adjustment might have been larger, but there may simply be a base seasonal variation in the difficulty.

It means there's no mining collapse spiral. The only remain problem is that as the hashrate drops, the Bitcoin becomes more vulnerable to a 51% attack, but [hashrate hasn't dropped much yet]( it's actually close to an all-time-high.


Bitcoin is designed to be economically similar to a precious metal: mined but not consumed.


The [predictable inflation rate]( is a core part of Bitcoin's design. It's currently about 9.6% annually, because of newly mined coins. This is dropping very gradually, but halves every four years. The next block reward halving will be [about July 30th 2016]( and inflation will fall to about 4%. Miners will get 12.5 bitcoins per solved block, instead of 25 today. In the beginning it was 50. By the end of 2020 inflation will be about 1.8% - a much more reasonable number for a currency.
Some altcoins are [pre-mined]( so the early miners got a much larger portion of the coins. A 100% pre-mined coin has zero inflation, like your example, but it needs to have a high value and significant transaction volume or there will be no miners. This is nearly impossible to do from a standing start, especially when competing with Bitcoin. If, on the other hand, the mining reward is initially low, then inflation really starts to hurt. Noone will hold the coin for longer than absolutely necessary, and it will take decades before it becomes interesting as an investment. The high early inflation in Bitcoin was mostly balanced by a rapid increase in users, but that's not likely to ever be repeated.
There are a lot of interesting variations in the Bitcoin economic model, but so far none of them has been good enough to seriously threaten Bitcoin's network effect. I recommend looking into peercoin as an example alternative.

Imagine I told Frank that public transport is better in Zurich than his hometown, Detroit. Frank's response is "But I don't wanna fly to Switzerland every time I take the bus!" *Of course not, Frank, but the buses are still better over here!* "But what about the airport security?" *Frank, the buses leave every ten minutes, and they're quiet and comfortable, but you have to get here first.*


But even that's not true any more. You can use Bitcoin directly at Dell, Overstock, Newegg, Takeaway.com and Expedia. You can get at 20% discount using Bitcoin at Amazon using Brawker, or 10% off at hundreds of stores using Gyft. There are literally thousands of places where you can spend Bitcoin, and the options are still growing quickly.


Circle.com takes minutes to register, not days. There are zero fees. You can buy Bitcoin with a credit card and it can be across the world in half an hour.

If 90% the nodes die due to memory issues, what would the remaining 10% do? Presumably they'd spend a few minutes timing out their network connections to the lost nodes, but would they thereafter run more efficiently? SPV wallets probably wouldn't be able to find a node to broadcast to for a while, and so there would be fewer new transactions. Miners could conceivably be separated from one another, working on two different blockchains for a while. What if there were only three nodes left running? It would be almost impossible to connect to them to broadcast a transaction, and once other nodes came back online, they'd be all connect to get the missing blocks and transactions. 
I wonder if it would make sense to have some specialized nodes - nodes that only accept or rebroadcast high-priority transactions, or nodes that share the blockchain but not the mempool. They would then be more stable, and help others come back online after a crash.

Makes me wonder if that would be an effective way to kill bitcoin with a quantum computer. Mine with your quantum computer until the difficulty goes up 100x, then switch it off, and the hashrate drops to 1/100th for several years or until someone else switches on a quantum computer.
Would it really be so hard to increase the frequency of the difficulty adjustments? Some altcoins do it every block.

Here's a few scenarios to get the ball rolling:
Bitcoin has a high stable value, but transaction fees make it useless for most private individuals. A secretive organisation representing banks releases a closed source official client and licenses miners.
Bitcoin has dropped in value but remains in use by dark markets. Exchanges are mostly gone, those that remain are very intrusive about privacy. Running a bitcoin node on your pc will likely result in a visit from the police.
A bitcoin clone has become very popular, displacing bitcoin. The clone replaces some national currencies,  and makes some early speculators astronomically wealthy.
Bitcoin is only used by machines talking to other machines to prevent spam. The value is low because the velocity is so high.

The problem is that you don't know that the seller isn't going to move the bitcoins before you do, but there are ways around that.

Who "gives" the 25 bitcoins?
They're new. This is where all bitcoins come from. The amount issued halves every four years, until around 2140 the reward is to small to measure. 


Check that it's spending coins that are unspent, that the signatures are correct, and that the scripts execute. 


I don't follow your reasoning here. There's a block every ten minutes (go and watch them come in on  ), each block contains hundreds of transactions. The limit is currently about 3 per second. Each block issues 25 new bitcoins and confirms thousands of bitcoins worth of transactions.

Bitcoin *can* natively do micropayments, using nlocktime. It requires creation of a small transaction, which then grows in tiny increments over time. For example, you send $1, then increase it to $1.00001 then to $1.00002 etc for no additional transaction fee. 
This could be a solution for the OP, but he'd still have to write it himself. AFAIK there also aren't any wallets (certainly not mobile wallets) which could receive this sort of transaction.
On the plus side, writing a nlocktime transaction becomes much easier when the two parties already trust each other (hopefully the case here!)
edit: It looks like "payment channels" is the new name for nlocktime. TIL

Your outgoing transaction will show A &amp; B on it, and *that will be the first time the public key to A &amp; B is made public*. Here's a quick reminder:
* 1 HD seed gives you many private keys
* one private key gives you one public key
* one public key gives you one address.
To receive you tell someone your address. When you send, you betray your public key.

Also on  "Typically it takes an average of 10 minutes to verify a transaction" isn't really correct. Ten minutes is the time between blocks, but you're going to broadcast your transaction somewhere between two blocks, so sometimes it will be one minute, and sometimes it will be ten. On average it will be about five minutes.
To get even more accurate, the hashrate has historically always increased, so the average block time is usually more like 8.5 minutes, so 4.25 minutes is typical. But when you get down to that level, you should include the time for your transaction to propagate, which can add 30-45 seconds, so we're back to five minutes.

Well, it *is* bad if your national economy is competing with other economies. If people save and don't spend or invest, the economy stagnates, and other nations outcompete you.

It's correct, and sort of obvious to someone who uses a lot of public transport.
Let's pretend my bus leaves every two minutes. I've generated some completely random times that I might arrive at the bus stop:
| time |
| - |
| 20:37:59 |
| 02:10:37 |
| 16:21:27 |
| 13:32:11 |
| 02:17:56 |
| 15:11:47 |
| 09:17:10 |
| 19:14:05 |
| 02:20:23 |
| 09:11:47 |
Now here's how long I'd wait for the bus in each case:
| time | wait in seconds |
| - | - |
| 20:37:59 | 1 |
| 02:10:37 | 73
| 16:21:27 | 33 |
| 13:32:11 | 109 |
| 02:17:56 | 4 |
| 15:11:47 | 13 |
| 09:17:10 | 50 |
| 19:14:05 | 115 |
| 02:20:23 | 97 |
| 09:11:47 | 13 |
Take the average of the times waited, and it's 50 seconds. If you get some more data, it will close on 60 seonds, exactly half the period between two busses.

The words are simply a human-friendly encoding of the HD seed, which is used to generate a new address for each transaction. The entropy is as good as the RNG used to generate the seed.

"Most users"? Current users? I disagree. Most current users are young middle class technophiles and have no difficulty sorting 60GB. Future users? Well, that includes the 10% of people who don't even have clean water. I try to help them when I can, but I'm not prioritising bitcoin access. 
There are also known ways of reducing the size of the blockchain, such as by using Merkle trees. Current blockchain growth is dwarfed by improvements in hardware, which is why many think it should be allowed to accelerate. There may be scalability issues, but the size of the blockchain won't be the first serious one.

You mentioned another problem - their suppliers don't accept Bitcoin. These Greek wannabe-bitcoiners will need to contact their suppliers and ask "why not?"

It sounds like you have a good understanding of the fundamentals of cryptography, but are missing the important details of how encoding can work:
Say your RNG gives you a nice random binary string:
    10101101111111110010110000010000
You can encode this as octal so:
    255 7762 6020
Or as Hexidecimal it's even shorter:
    ADFF 2C10
It gets shorter each time because each character has more possibilities. First 2, then 8 then 16. It's hard to have more possibilities for each character, because you run out of letters (and unicode is hard to type). The [BIP 39]( standard describes a list of 2048 words, each with a specific numerical value. Thus the 16^8 possibilities of 8 hex characters can be summarized completely with 2048^3 just three english words:
    typical describe library
The entropy isn't compromised, because the keyspace remains constant, and the result is much easier for humans to memorize.
Note: choosing the words yourself doesn't work. You can't pick the words with enough entropy. You have to let the computer generate the random number and then encode it.
Here's the list of English words used: 
(I didn't have a BIP 39 tool handy, so the 3 words in the example don't have the same value as the rest of the example)

Exporting them individually would be tedious, but you can export the xPub (extended public key), which is a recipe for automatically generating public addresses. Note that if someone gets hold of this, they can link all of your addresses, and your privacy is compromised.  I don't have my keepkey in front of me, but I know xPub export is supported by the hardware. Look in the menus and see if you can find it.
Alternatively, you can regenerate your xPub from your seed, but that requires trusting the hardware you're using to enter your seed.
You could also upgrade your phone, since Mycelium on Android supports this directly - including plugging your keepkey directly into your phone.

Sorry, my last comment was sloppily written on my phone. Mycelium is an Android Bitcoin wallet. It has a built-in function called "Local Trader". This uses your phone's location services to find people nearby buying or selling Bitcoins, which you exchange for cash. It's like localbitcoins, but only for cash.
This would allow people with cash in Donetsk to buy bitcoins, move them over the border, and sell them to get their wealth out of the country. It would also allow people outside (like yourself) to send Bitcoins into the area which can then be sold.
If people are becoming aware of Bitcoins, then you should be able to convince someone in a local shop or kiosk to create a Mycelium Ad. They can demand 10% on every transaction, and make good money without leaving the shop.

Doing the paperwallets on a secure offline computer is a good idea.

3. Friends/family settling debts
4. People trying to hide assets (eg divorce/tax)
5. Nerds who just want play with the technology
6. Capital Flight (eg China)
7. Home daytraders who think they can beat the market ( )
8. Other ideological reasons ( eg.  )
I'm not saying I condone all these uses, or even think that Bitcoin is appropriate, but don't dismiss Bitcoin because it's only interesting to a small group. Bitcoin is new, and people are still discovering uses for it.

You should find out who processes their Bitcoin orders. It's really really unlikely that they're generating public keys, sending them to the users, and then throwing away the matching private key.

That doesn't follow. The price changes because expectations of the future price change.




Ok, so there's a premium for anonymous coins, and an exchange withdrawal fee. So what. This has nothing to do with the fact that expectations of the future price - the probability of going to zero or the moon - are not just included in the price, they are the *primary* drivers of price.

In another comment James (the white guy interviewed) said that Ronald took the bitcoins to the bus interchange, and shouted "Who knows what bitcoins are?" So there doesn't seem to be much risk of centralization there! It's hard to even say whether Ronald or the guy buying the bitcoins was the "exchange".
The Android wallet Mycelium includes a decentralized exchange tool that lets you use your GPS to find someone buying or selling bitcoins near you. This makes it *very* easy for kiosks or corner shops to set themselves up as exchanges, just install the app and train the staff. There are some similar programs for desktop computers.
The end-goal for Bitcoin is always the point when people stop wanting to exchange them for local currency, and just use their bitcoins for trade. At first glance, the Bitcoin price appears to have dropped from $320 to $240 this year (-33%), but in Euro it's gone from €262 to €225 (-16%), and in Ukraine, Argentina, Venezuala (and other oil-reliant economies), bitcoin has actually *gained* in value this year. I certainly wouldn't claim that Bitcoin is going to end poverty, but these are a few ways that it helps level the playing field.
IMHO none of this touches on the most groundbreaking aspect of Bitcoin, which is that, for the first time, anyone or *anything* can own money. If you don't need a bank account, or even a physical presence, all sorts of new financial entities become possible, so-called **DAC**s - distributed autonomous corporations, encoding of town charters in code, digital contracts which enforce themselves, and all sorts of craziness. I have no idea whether all this is going to be good or bad, my main question becomes "can we even stop it?" and if not, I want to be on board.

Bitcoin users are mostly young (20-30), male, well-educated and technophiles. Is that who you usually sell your art to? I don't know, but I think most art-buyers have established households and are older (40-60).
Bitcoin is Internet money. It really makes sense using it to buy and sell on the Internet. In person it doesn't make quite as much sense. Do you tend to sell your work online or in person? I don't buy much art myself, but I can't imagine spending more than about 2btc on a work without seeing it for myself. 
No offense, but it sounds to me like you're more interested in betting on Bitcoin's future price than in selling art. Maybe you should visit where speculating/gambling on the future price of btc is a popular hobby/addiction.

There's very little personal information in your post, but you are challenging us to make a recommendation that Bitcoin is useful to *you*.
It sounds like you have a credit card and use PayPal. That alone makes you an atypical human. Less than half of the world has PayPal or Credit Cards. And to get either of these, you need a bank account, which only about half the people on earth have. Getting a Bitcoin wallet is far far easier than getting a bank account.

No, seriously, there's nothing efficient about repetition of work to the degree that bitcoins takes it. If you have an important database, it should be kept in at least three different locations, with the possibility of fast failover. Bitcoin has &gt; 6000 full nodes. If all you're doing is storing data, that's *not* efficient.
It's *only* an efficient way to run a database if you're making the assumption that you can't trust anyone, and the only reason Bitcoin needs this is to stop someone abusing monetary policy.

Very easy: Calculate the number of mined coins each day (25×6×24) and multiply by their value ($450). You get about $1.6 million. This is the amount of new money flowing into Bitcoin each day (to keep the price about stable). Assume this remains constant when the supply of new coins halves (it's hardly varied outside 0.5-2 million daily in three years).
Either demand has to decrease (possible, but why now?), or the price must increase (which will have a positive feedback on demand).

This seems to be the bit that everyone misses. You can argue for days about whether inflation is good or bad for the economy, or whether people will accept pay cuts, blah blah blah. 
If people hoard bitcoins their price will rise. That's it.

1. Start with a long, memorable phrase. Song lyrics are good for this. Look for something that rhymes, because humans are good at remembering rhymes. Length is important.
2. Get some entropy from outside your brain. This doesn't have to be much, about five characters will suffice. Use dice or a computers RNG. 
3. Insert the the random characters in two random locations in your phrase. The repitition is for your memory. The location should be randomly generated, dice or a RNG again, and may be in the middle of a word. You might like to roll again if one random sequence is inserted inside the other, because this breaks the memorability.
4. Congratulations on your new brain wallet, now don't use it.

I just calculated the average fee from the [last block]( as 0.0001338 btc, so 3cents/ 134bits (I copy/pasted it into excel and added average). 
IIRC, near the end of 2013 the fee in bitcoin core dropped from 0.001 to 0.0001. Some other wallets already had lower fees, some followed. The most recent change was "floating fees" which makes them auto-adjust. My guess is that floating fees aren't going to make much difference, so I think you should base your calculation on 100 bits.

The Casper proposal for Ethereum uses network analysis to find the "connected" nodes (based on throughput, not funds), and weights the rewards around the edge of this area.

If he's new to bitcoin, keep them there for now, it's one of the safest exchanges. Completing the ID process, changing the password, and enabling 2FA should be the first priorities.
Bitcoin.de might not be the best place to sell them, because of the lack of liquidity. If he's patient, he might get a good price, but if he dumps them all at once, he'll drive the price down. 
If he's set on selling and not spending or saving, he should probably move them to three or four different exchanges, such as Bitstamp, Kraken, Safello (assuming he's in Europe). Then he can sell the 300 coin chunks fairly easily.

This argument assumes that miners are investors, have privileged price information (which turns out to be wrong), and they are the most significant part of Bitcoin pricing. We can take the miners right out of the argument: The majority of Bitcoin investors expect a price increase, this anticipation is already priced in, the majority will be disappointed when no further increase comes, so they will dump and crash the price.
I think the biggest flaw in this argument is that it doesn't account for new adoption. People who are still learning about bitcoin don't yet know about the halving, so can't possibly have the expectation of a halving-related increase. I think there are enough examples of people who don't have this confidence in a price increase right here in this thread, but I don't know what proportion of the $1.6 million/day they make up.

So I don't see where your numbers came from. 1000/s is only necessary if the fee drops. I think what you're really saying is that if &lt;50% of block rewards are coinbases (&gt;50% are fees), Bitcoin is here to stay. If the fee stays at 134 bits, 75 transactions per second by 2020 is enough to acheive &gt;50% fee rewards.
What still worries me is that the total hashing power of the network only reflects what the miners can make as  profit, but not the cost of attacking the network. I'd personally like to see coinbases unspendable for longer (12 months or so) so that miners have a stronger interest in keeping the network secure.
