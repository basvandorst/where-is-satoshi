That is the goal Yoda.  We've got a big sponsorship dropping in March.  We need to expand our reach quick though.  If possible, please promote this reddit story on twitter or elsewhere.  Thank you and please keep in touch!
@_date: 2018-03-31 19:06:39
Yep that's us ;)  We're kicking off our first sponsorship with a 1 BTC giveaway too.  Follow for more details mid-week.

We hear you Captain Tom, but we tend to think that there’s enough crypto on crypto trolling to take us to Mars and back. At the moment we’re interested most in taking our sense of humor to the streets to educate normie trolls on the power of our community. ����
@_date: 2018-02-24 19:16:05
we love that idea!!!
@_date: 2018-02-24 19:26:54
It certainly would be.  Got any ideas on how to do it in a disarming, funny way? 
@_date: 2018-03-31 19:45:01
That’s cool, but this is better ��
@_date: 2018-02-24 19:17:27
aren't you worried that might just be too easy? LOLOLOL!!!!

50% to educate the world on bitcoin. 50% to troll the trolls, IRL. 
@_date: 2018-02-25 22:33:04
Agreed �� got any ideas on how to do it most effectively?
@_date: 2018-02-24 21:32:01
CNBC and all cable news is something else. BK ain’t seem all that bad tbh. At the outset were mostly focused on poking the really BIG crypto bears ����
