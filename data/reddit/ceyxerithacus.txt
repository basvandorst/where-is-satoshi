I know it's not the most popular pick, but I mine at deepbit, mainly because historically they have given me the fewest connectivity problems. It's really just that simple. I set up my farm over a year ago, so I don't have a fancy failover setup, and as long as I stuck with deepbit I never really felt the need to. I don't care about having PPS either; it all averages out.

If you have to time the market when you arbitrage, you're doing it wrong. For your sister's sake, just buy and hold. I would also recommend being honest with your sister about what you did.

I've been considering using USD. It seems fairly useful, and very interesting. But I am really on the fence about it. I mean really hemming and hawing. There may even be moral implications. Please convince me.

I know there are several directories of bitcoin businesses, but for some reason coinmap is the only one I can ever remember.

Is ChatSecure open source? How can you be sure it's not compromised? Maybe Apple allows it because they can read everything.

A friend of mine native to northern India told me that nearly everything is illegal in India, because the government system runs on bribes. If you are stopped doing something "illegal" they don't really want to stop you, they just want to be paid a small bribe to look the other way. He said 'bribe' is not a dirty word there. The incentive to getting a government job is the prospect of collecting bribes, and this is common knowledge and not offensive. It may seem backwards to us, but it works for them. So of course bitcoin would be illegal there, but it's not as serious as you think.
