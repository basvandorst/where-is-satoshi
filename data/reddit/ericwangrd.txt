Traders don't bother borrowing Bitcoins for short selling them, however the platform, no matter whichever has to borrow Bitcoins to their traders to short them.

Nobody who has bitcoins wants price drop, so do people who lend their bitcoins out. They just don't understand for &lt; 2% monthly gain, the bitcoins they lent out could cause &gt;10% price drop easily in couple of days.

we shout it out, let them heard, and might be some of them just realize how they were stupid.

I am buying and hodling anyway, just don't understand why people lend out their precious bitcoins just for 19% yearly return.

It is good for you. Seems a perfect plan, you get everything, short term stable interests and cheaper coins, long term holding for exponential return. But wait, are you serious?

I was day trading Bitcoin by reading the tape one year ago when I don't know what is Bitcoin and don't care what it could do for the future. But with learning bitcoin and blockchain technology, I am holding Bitcoins for long term. Never short Bitcoin, 200$ is your maximum gain, and the sky is your potential loss.

Sort of. Traders don't need to borrow in Bitcoins in order to short, the platform take care of it. When one Bitcoin has been lent for a week, it might be short sell seven times since the majority of short selling are very quick.

I do have an account with bitfinex, I just never short sell things in which I believe .
@_date: 2015-01-21 03:37:30
yeah, that is the point. seems not difficult to understand.

Thanks for the link firstly, I really don't think short selling will destroy Bitcoin，just like I will never short a stock to the death. What I do concern, short selling are making money out of the bitcoin believers, those short guns are making quick money out of the community, with ' I just don't care the future of Bitcoin' attitude, that makes me sick.

for our own sake.

As a trader, I only short sell stocks about which I smell something wrong, and that should apply for the Bitcoin. Why do you wanna buy Bitcoin on the first place, if you think sth. wrong?

I don't know who you are, but I have to downvote your post since you are lying.
