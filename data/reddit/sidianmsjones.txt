This is off topic, I'm sorry, but how the hell do I make a self post in this sub? I cannot figure it out.

Don't downplay action, man. Support!
@_date: 2014-03-30 14:42:15
Agreed. But I also think this is completely normal and fine for now. Nobody could really expect a new currency like this to be stable right out the gate. It will take time to get it stable, but I think we are well on the way.

Person to person. I definitely have Coinbase in mind, and noticed they have a system that prevents any price fluctuations from affecting the transfer, but I'm not sure how complicated or practical that is to set up.

I'm game.

I know there are already logos and such. I'm just having some fun. It's funny though, out of all the logos I've seen, none seemed to merge the "b" in "bitcoin" with the Thai Baht "B". Seemed an obvious choice so I put it together.

Watch out, he's got an IT department!

Ahh, this is why there has been all the talk about the Escrow stuff right?
@_date: 2013-04-12 06:18:23
Oh good.
@_date: 2013-03-29 20:41:47
Ah, so this wallet can actually be moved around. That makes a little more sense. I'll check around and look for these options now.
@_date: 2013-04-12 06:12:18
Where can I hook up with some of that?
@_date: 2013-03-11 18:49:48
I like that but I think the anonymous logo would be even better.
@_date: 2013-04-03 01:48:47
To clarify what I mean by standardization, I just mean something that people everywhere could and would use as a standard representation of Bitcoin. I realize that's a very long shot but you never know.
That being the case I wouldn't mind selling them for a pretty bitty, if ya know what I mean.
@_date: 2013-04-03 18:15:18
Thanks everyone.

I vote for wallet. As someone who is quite tech savvy I find the whole wallet structure to be really confusing. Secondly I have no use for Escrow service at this time.

How do I read charts like the one on Bitcoinity?

Didn't know that existed. Pretty cool.
@_date: 2013-11-19 05:16:36
Good question. The 800 I'm seeing at Bitcoinity right now. When I go to sell, it only lists for 720ish.
@_date: 2013-03-21 15:53:20
No prob.
@_date: 2013-03-29 20:42:13
Great, that's helpful. Am I going to have to pay fees though?
@_date: 2013-04-12 06:19:25
Looking to just buy a couple but waiting till they get below about 70 USD.

I am admittedly a pretty ignorant person in regards to how anything in the legal/governmental realm works. Now that I've read the other comments, I understand it's just as taxable as other money.
@_date: 2013-03-20 06:39:45
I like it but it doesn't say "currency" to me.
@_date: 2013-12-01 20:44:24
Would love to see a "FIXED" version. :)
@_date: 2013-06-09 22:33:44
True, but perhaps it provides a very good background with which to think more so about the importance of a currency like Bitcoin. Honestly with the kind of values this guy supports, I'm surprised he didn't mention it himself.

Darnit, unfortunately I just registered there and it says I must be a member for a while, post my own topics, etc, before I can reply to that topic. I don't suppose someone could copy/paste what I said above into that forum topic?

I'd like to offer my services to help with any of this as needed. I'm a graphic and web designer and also have a decent background in PR and marketing, getting articles on Mashable, TC, FastCompany, and many more. A few days ago my book was even on the Joe Rogan Experience. I've given talks in parts of the US and in other countries. Those have been about Shamanism, Open Source Religion, and Personal Mythology, but I have a decent amount of experience and am willing to make appearances and speak if needed.
I think most people who've heard me speak or debate will tell you I'm very articulate and assertive. You won't see me getting pushed around by overbearing naysayers.

The caveat? As much as I adore Bitcoin and would absolutely love to help represent the movement, I'm a little rusty on the technical details. That said, that's what pretty much every PR experience is like...you go into someone else's company, get them to feed you all the details, talking points, etc, and weave that into a cohesive campaign for public consumption. So personally, I don't really see this as much of a downside. All I would really need is to hook up with a few of you who consider themselves well versed in Bitcoin.

I assume as much as well. Obviously it isn't extraterrestrial technology. :P But yeah, quite fascinating, thanks for the link.
