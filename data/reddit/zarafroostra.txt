Could this show us that Nvidia analytics expect this mining business to die down extremely fast?

Controlling money supply?

That is a mess. Just one mistake and you morons will shut down global economy.

The problem is none of them will invest into such a variance market while they have such huge market already covered. It's simply not worth for them to do that

Do you guys feel that with this uncontrolled growth you could cripple global economy for years? I mean lets face it ... the sole purpose of banks is to prevent this from happening. And here a few nerds control millions or some even billions. This looks like a disaster waiting to happen.

even when an event is unreal on market or caused by something entirely false (best example are war threats) the currency often does not recover because of massive selling that happened during the active event.

Your name is seancole .... You don't even have a cooch! (2019 ... Am I even allowe to say that? :) )

I agree. If it shoots up it can happen but I have my doubts about it going much further because of reasons above.

No. People with !military support in both cases were able to. If they only had m16s they would to this day still be storming the presidential house.

We can discuss how much I have but that is not pertinent to the debate. I would much rather discuss my reasoning, which would help me decide what to do with my money.

This is not the debate we are having. However to illustrate what I think about bitcoin as legit money. Do you know that gun owners in US argue for owning guns by saying as a way to protect themselves with m16 from corrupt governement, while said gov has drones, [carriers](  
It is as impossible to defend against corrupt government with m16 as is to enforce the use of some geeky currency. I know you don't like that but that's how it is. If the govt is corrupt they can stop use of bitcoin and if they are not corrupt it is not needed.

you mean believe in the technology and its applications?

Being extremely dense or being an idiot is basically the same thing mate. Imamnsure you can do better than make an ad hominem attack. Again attack ideas not the person.  However I am sure you lack the intelligence to do so .

Ah shit ... want my coins as a off court settlement?
@_date: 2019-05-11 16:38:20
Attack arguments not the person. Attack arguments not the idea.

selling half means I made no money and the whole gambling what other users will do comes into effect.

I do not think lambo memes are real but I do think they are a good illustration of the logic behind the majority of bitcoin investors.
What? The Greece example might be unclear. I wanted to say that Greece is the best modern example why banks are some sort of guarantee of value of money while btc has no such guarantee. For other items on the market for example oil this guarantee comes from its usefulness. I invest in oil because I know someone will be willing to buy it. And I trust in euro because I know it's in banks best interest to keep it valuable and only catastrophic events like  in Venezuela can make it worthless.
You are not arguing against the idea you are making claims. I cannot comment if you do not explain what exactly you mean (regarding the average Joe)
There are reasons why I do not see value in bitcoin but this is besides the point. The question is not if I see it's value but if the public and the investors see it. I do not thinknty do.
Its no problem if you are harsh the problem is that your post is empty and I cannot comment on it. You refer to bitcoin value but unless you argue for it I cannot constructively comment.
