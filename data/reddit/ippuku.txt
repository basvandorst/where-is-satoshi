Awesome, thanks!

Thanks for the heads up! What do you recommend besides mechanical mods? Those have always been appealing to us, but the user-friendliness aspect of it has kept us away - they can be a pain in the ass for newcomers. We've been looking to add some kind of variable voltage unit to our selection but if you have any other suggestions, don't hesitate!

Thanks! How much love is enough? Well, we've gotten one sale since we enabled it in early May for about $45. Luckily for us, this has appreciated to $60 with the recent price increase. We're not looking for a homerun, just doing a little bit of reaching out to those who may be looking for organic e-liquid and quality hardware.
We will probably post in some other subreddits as well...etc. Any other ideas, let me know.

Some form of electronic cigarette would work to atomize the liquid, but I can't say if it *should*. I'm not a doctor so I can't comment on that aspect, but yes theoretically you could put your liquid into our Catalyst tank and have it ready to vaporize at any given moment. 
Again, I'm not a doctor and I'm not recommending anything. Just saying that it should vaporize in theory.

We sure do. In fact, Canadians have been our second most supportive customers after the US. Australia is a close 3rd though....you wouldn't want them to catch up now would you? ;)
