I was thinking Bernie Sanders but I guess that works too...

lol, my retiree uncle wants to invest in Bitcoins. Later during the discussion it turns out that he doesn't even understand why return isn't the only metrics that matters and how return should be measured relative to risk. He literally said something like "my friend has a far better banker because he got an X% return last year and I only got Y%, so I want to invest in Bitcoins to improve my return". WTF...
If anything people should fear more. This is just the housing or dotcom bubble all over again where everyone including your cab driver and supermarket sales clerk invests in something they know nothing about and believe that it must increase forever.

Well, "they aren't using it for transactions" is a pretty good guess...

I posted this above. My uncle, who literally doesn't even understand the concept of risk and return, and can barely use a PC now wants to invest in Bitcoins to "improve his return". Also he went to an event of some "Bitcoin investment firm" and apparently like 2/3 of the people were retirees.

He does this all the time. They clearly define the narrative before hand and then they "research" the topic with the goal to only focus on point that fits the narrative. The more political the topic the more they are doing that. Can you not see how all his "research" happens to come to conclusions that always fits a certain US politics narrative? E.g. is there any episode where they look into something some large company did and then they conclude that the company was actually right and the people accusing them were wrong? Not that companies are never doing anything wrong but the audience of the show wants to hear "large companies are all evil" stories because it fits their narrative.
This really isn't too different from e.g. Fox News constantly reporting about how immigrants commit crimes. They focus on that because their audience wants to hear the "immigrants are criminals" narrative.

lol, you couldn't be further from the truth. Literally every show is designed to confirm a certain political narrative in US politics, mainly hold by young middle class people. The level of ignorance from people watching him and thinking it's balanced is quite fascinating. You really aren't that much better than a Fox News viewer. And I actually overall agree with Oliver's political views, but as a European it's quite puzzling to see how the left in the US complains about the brainwashed right but then gets all their information from comedians and late night hosts and believes that they aren't biased.
