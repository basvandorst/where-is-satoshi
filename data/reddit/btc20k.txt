+$10 verify Thank you, this is something to think about and start planning.

1. Never, the taxes and stuff are nuts. I need a money advisor. I've also considered an around the world trip for a few years after setting up residence in another country possibly portugal or caribbean because the capital gains taxes in my country are significantly higher than other places. I wouldn't mind if my fellow countymen got good service for their taxes but it's all going to pay for failed banks and secured unknown bondholders.
2. I expect it to go far higher. Ask any man or woman on the street what bitcoin is and the vast majority have never heard of it.

The question was did I cash out all my coins, the answer was no but I have enough out that a bitcoin crash wouldnt matter too much :)

+$10 verify Yes I will do something like this. There was more to the title of this post, as you can see it doesnt link with the subject matter but i didnt know if it would be downvoted to hell. Once I can get a bit more accustomed to things I will totally be spending my time helping others.

I don't exactly follow your question but I've been on dates with girls who are definitely not my type and I expect to get thrown to the curb but for some reason I don't, girls that I consider far better looking than me and this has only happened since this money arrived. My goal is to find a long term partner though not easy sex so i am hoping to find someone who likes me for me, when im nearly sure these two/three women aren't on my wavelength. Picture a nerdy guy with a tall leggy blonde and you see the extrapolated version of what i'm talking about.

Thank you this is good advice, its just taking time to get adjusted. I would like to invest in a bitcoin startup but this is something I havn't had time to put a lot of thought into and don't know where to start.
