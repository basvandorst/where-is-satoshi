No point in spreading bullshit. We need to support coins with real features/technology or joke coins will start to take over.

Okay =)
Progress is being made by the community.
Anyway the point is there is no evidence to prove that his prediction of Quark was wrong. The coin is around 6 month old. Research how other top coins were 6 months in.

You gotta at least lay down some actual proof that him backing Quark is bad! Quark coin right now looks very promising. (Gonna get thumbs down because people don't like to talk using evidences)
 Progress is being made by the Quark community.

It would actually be the opposite. The longer confirmation time the easier to double spend.   
So technically it would be more secure for faster coins.

From a previous post people told me you're a complete moron should I believe that? Do some research and understand why a fast mining scheme and how it helps the stability of the coin. A low upkeep result in stability. Basically if you need to constantly MINE then those new coins added into the market will need new buyers. If no new buyers come in then the value of the coin will drop. Quark battled this by trying out a new economical model. There is no right or wrong, but it's a step towards looking at cryptocurrency in a new view. Also don't give me bullshit of OPINIONS. I'm just here for FACTS. Just so you know Quark distribution is already on the road of being better distributed than most coins. Do some research here  and look at distribution patterns.
