I'm wondering too, give it a few hours. Also their exchange rates seem a bit low, BTC went sub-2700 whole other exchanges were 2750+

No, he means coins like the ones purported to be held by the likes of Satoshi Nakamoto.

Just making sure haha. Thought you might have been referring to all the testing they've been doing.

We cannot implement Segwit2x, it's a scam to destroy Bitcoin.

The service is called Shuttle Delivery, it's a popular delivery service for expats like me who live in Korea. Check them out [here] (

What do you mean by that? I haven't really used any of the online payment services offered by Korean companies, but what makes them so bad?

You can set a transaction fee as low as a few pennies, if you're fine with waiting a bit for your transaction to clear. The whole 'transaction fees too high' thing was mainly resolved with the introduction of Segwit, just set a low (1-2 Satoshi per byte) fee and wait.

You're dodging the topic at hand. It doesn't matter how and why this much hashing power is concentrated in China, the only thing that matters is how it is used to influence Bitcoin. With a 51% hashrate majority, Jihan can essentially control Bitcoin by voting on its future. Think of it like a board of directors- if one person has a 51% share, their vote cannot possibly be overturned.
