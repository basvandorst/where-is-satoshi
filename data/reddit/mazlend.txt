Yeah I'm locked from mine as well - however I'm not traveling, but I certainly feel your pain!  Looking forward to a quick response &amp; correction of this issue.
@_date: 2014-05-26 17:15:27
I was in yesterday and bought some BTC - very simple &amp; easy to use since all of the verification features were turned off (palm scan, passport scan, etc...) Hopefully it stays like this as long as possible.

Check out our site:
[How to get bitcoins in Canada](
There's a number of ways, the best option is up to you. You can use an exchange, buy locally via local bitcoins (or craigslist/kijiji), or if you are in Vancouver or Toronto you can use a bitcoin ATM.

Awesome! We'll support where we can. We've tweeted AirCanada, Sunwing, &amp; TTC in the past and received responses - so looking forward to keeping it going.

Try out Evr.

I've been using it since its release. I usually tell anyone who wants to get started with bitcoin that this is the simplest way to setup a wallet.

Excellent! Much needed service, I will definitely be using.

I've used Bylls and had a similar experience while paying one of my AMEX bill. I reached out to their support and was immediately contacted by their CEO Eric, who is currently looking into my issue.
This company is brand new and has strong ties to the Montreal Bitcoin Embassy, so I think it's safe to say it's not a scam. I'll keep you posted on situation.

I'd highly recommend having your friend watch all of James' videos. They are great.

Just paid my first bill with this service, very quick and easy - well done!
@_date: 2014-02-18 01:23:25
Keep up the great work! I loved the first issue and can't wait until the next one. Thanks for doing this, the professional touch is exactly what is needed.
@_date: 2014-05-21 01:19:09
Awesome - can't wait to check it out!

We're actually up to 173 now! 
More and more submissions coming in each day.
@_date: 2017-11-27 20:15:28
Indeed it was.
@_date: 2017-11-27 20:24:54
I suppose we should've added more specifics for such a high stakes bet. I, and I'm sure most others in the space at the time wouldn't count that flash crash to $100 on Bitfinex. As no other exchange was close to that. Bitstamp was more of the defacto exchange during that time with almost double the volume. However, I'm a good sport and will honour the bet if the community agrees.
@_date: 2013-12-16 22:34:05
@_date: 2013-11-28 17:48:14
This is expected in an emerging market going through price discovery. I hope you are right, because the resulting panic sellers that would drive the price to $100 are exactly the kind of speculators that are not investing in bitcoin for its long term promise and potential.    
 Get them out of the way and allow these coins to get into the hands of those building the infrastructure and services of the future that we will all be using some day.

Coming soon. 
@_date: 2013-10-30 13:53:55
Sounds good! I plan to spend the next couple of days getting everything together and will have something launched early next week.
@_date: 2013-11-02 15:18:28
Yeah I hear ya - the local option sounds like your best bet to get a hold of them quickly.    
I'm still on the fence as what to do: Either wait for cavirtex verification to go through and use their bill payment system (2-3 days for funds), or just move forward with my bitstamp wire transfer (3-5 days in, and 2-3 days to add funds to account).
@_date: 2013-12-26 00:56:31
Amazing! Looking forward to featuring you as soon as it's announced. 
@_date: 2013-11-28 16:49:21
I kind of hope it does so I can scoop up a bunch more, so I see it as a win win. When it goes to $10k I'll buy him a couple year's worth for being a good sport.
@_date: 2013-11-02 00:51:50
Hope you aren't in a hurry... I've been waiting for verification for a week now. I imagine they got a huge influx of new registrations with all the press lately. Bitstamp was a much quicker process to get verified for.
@_date: 2013-12-19 04:02:48
Really enjoying these! Great job and keep them coming.
@_date: 2013-12-27 04:22:57
I'll be there next week - looking forward!

Send us an email at info we'd be happy to answer any questions you have and guide you through the process (for free!)
@_date: 2013-12-10 00:04:34
That's next up (About page)! We launched a little early and have a very small team - been spending time on building out the other sections first.
@_date: 2013-12-10 22:11:51
It is legit! 
It's developed by Anthony Di Iorio, who is the Exec Director of the Bitcoin Alliance of Canada. Him and his team were the guys behind "Rush Wallet", and KryptoKit is the next evolution of that. It provides an incredible instant wallet service, and has the support of main players like Roger Ver.
You can watch Anthony explain it on the new Canadian bitcoin podcast here:

My thoughts as well, which is one of the reasons I made this little bet in the first place. No one has said it's going to be a smooth ride up to a 'stable' market cap - but my advice to all those getting in now is: strap a helmet on &amp; buckle your seat belt for all the bumps along the way.    
Creative destruction is a beautiful thing, only time will tell if bitcoin holds up - but as it stands right now, my 'reddit gold' is where my mouth is.

It is a free service, similar to Dark Wallet. Developed by the Executive Director of the Bitcoin Alliance of Canada, it's legit!

The stakes are certainly high on this one!
@_date: 2013-12-10 00:22:14
Yeah I hear ya. I've been following bitcoin since 2011 &amp; all of the scams/misinformation are actually some of the main motivations behind our most recent initiative: BitCoinada. 
Our goal is to simply inform &amp; educate Canadians about bitcoin, helping both consumers and businesses understand what it is and how to use it. There is a plethora of information available on the web, but in our experience is that most people give up because it is 'too complicated'. We're hoping to help break down these barriers and foster the growth and acceptance of bitcoin in Canada.
We don't actually offer competitive services to bitpay, we promote them along with coinbase, coinkite, and other merchant solutions. We're a bunch of enthusiasts just doing our part!
@_date: 2013-10-30 14:26:23
Awesome! I'm looking forward to watching both grow, and I've got a couple other ideas as well, so perhaps we can work together in the future. In the meantime, you should add Canada to your list of how to buy bitcoins  is the main Canadian exchange. I'd be more than happy to send some people to your site.

This is fantastic - great job guys!! Will come by as soon as I'm back in Toronto.
@_date: 2013-10-30 14:07:07
Great - I'll certainly add them. I envision much more than just a list. I see this as a marketing tool for bitcoin appreciation and acceptance.    You often hear of bitcoin being used for illegal activities and such, and I think if we point journalists, reporters, etc to something very positive (And built well) it will not only help the cause (charities/non-profits), but bitcoin usage as well!
What do you think?
