Well, lots of places hand out cash money when you give them the coins. You pay a high fee but then you have no paperwork.

Well, never invest money you cant miss and if you do it with spare money then everything will be fine because blockchain is the future and bitcoin will reach 100k if it explodes

@_date: 2017-12-10 02:43:20
True but when demand is high the price will go up with less coins to feed. The whales die and thats when the sharks attack!!

WoW, just amazing and very generous of you to give back to world like you do and hope that more will follow because it cant be all about greed, right? I just started and have my small invest in potential alt coins and if ill ever make money then my intent is to give 3,% yearly to good causes but if ill make it big time which I highly doubt I'mma do the same 100%

Yea, people that buying cryptos for a quick buck are the one that get burned but if you believe in the tech and blockchain then its all good in the long run. Cryptos are here to stay so even this dip gets washed away. Think i have big problems with are the low life loser that hang on crypto reddit subs, while they havnt invested in the coin, they going full force to bash it like a headless chicken
