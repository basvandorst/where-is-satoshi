Pshhhhh bitcoin is so 2017.  If you don't know alt coins is the future, then you just don't know.  I would know.

I could hardly keep my AdvoCare down just thinking about those poor souls who came in late.   It's unfortunate for those who were fooled, but Bitconnect collapsing is massively positive and long overdue.  It was clear from the beginning what they were doing.

The only thing we know for certain is that China’s space laboratory is falling back to Earth and will crash either in the Northern Hemisphere or Southern Hemisphere; possibly parts of the United States, the Iberian Peninsula, China, the Middle East, South America, Australia, and New Zealand (*source ESA*)....I’m just speculating but I think it could hit bitcoin too.

Incorrect.  Pyramiding is simply an investment strategy intended to minimize the risk you lose your entire investment should the market tank.  Rather than invest all your capital at front, you invest small amounts over an extended period of time.  Buying this way has absolutely nothing to do with a pyramid scheme. 
A pyramid scheme relies on recruiting new users.  See multi-level marketing companies, or Bitconnect for examples.  In a pyramid scheme, the price will continue to rise so long as there are new recruits; the pyramid collapses when the pool dries up.
