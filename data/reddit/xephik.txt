If you have active and updated antivirus/malware software then its about as safe as any other file on your computer on a normal day.
However you can consider using Trucrypt or something and throw your wallet in there when you don't plan on using it for a little while, with a backup on a microSD card that is tucked in a safe or a plain safe spot in your home.

I never said that antivirus/malware protection software can allow you to be oblivious to the security of your computer, of course it doesn't. I simply stated that with everything up to date, your wallet file is about as safe as any other file on your computer. That includes your wallet, a text file with your banking information (which is retarded), the naked pictures of your SO, etc etc. 
Not only is there the risk of the file being stolen/read whathaveyou, but malicious software can simply make your computer unusable by wiping your drive or locking you out, which is just as bad if you keep your wallet in a central location.
Keeping your wallet on a networked machine is risky, but not anymore risky then any other personal/sensitive/expensive information.

Were you a little concerned about depositing a decent amount of money into a random bank account? My seller had all positive feedback, but I couldn't shake the voice in the back of my head going "what are you doing?!" hah

My first purchase was this week using Localbitcoins as well, got 0.48 BTC. I went the cash deposit route, what did you choose?

Because once the purchase is complete the buyer can dispute the purchase etc etc. I have to admit, when I first got into BTC it baffled me as to why I couldn't just put my card number in and buy some somewhere.

I wish.
