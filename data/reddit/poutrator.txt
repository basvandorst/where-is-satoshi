Anayway, an article starting with "French led IMF with Christine Lagarde at the helm" is obviously shaggy. It is subtly calling on the French bashing feeling many american have ended integrating. Because, if, for one fuking second, one thinks Lagarde nationality is getting France any power, one is a moron. Lagarde has made most of her carreer at Baker &amp; McKenzie which she ultimately led. 
Edit : "I have been warning that there is an idea that has been running around behind the curtain that the national debt of the USA could be settled by usurping all pension funds in the country" Seriously... MAN  ! This author is bullshitting us, putting himself as a pithy. Taking on the private saving to redeem a failing state is the oldest trick in the book. Did he never heard about the Templar Knights ? Or the word nationalization... And that reference to "**socialist** governments"
This article should not have risen on :(

we say email (whatever *académiciens* say). Your post dated from 2003 (Posted 7/18/2003) not good for  a thread

I know that a huge focus of this forum is on the USA/Americas.  But the European Union is moving toward regulations over digital currencies.  I am sure (I hope they are) the European actors are already trying to  lobby people there. 
They probably would be glad to have some effective support more than : "yes, it's France and Europe, whatever, they are always backward" :)  
It is true (a bit). It is also true that France is a big member of the euro zone (the money area). So, what some few people in a Paris based commission think could matter for the whole European market. The European market is a big chunk of the world economy. Well.

Seriously... So what we do about the Bush administration and its wars and all the banks that found this ? You can't treat others too harshly when your own country and country's companies are doing unethical stuff everyday.

Stupid  question here : why is it that important to you to hide how much you own? Sorry, not a grown up. It's not about bitcoin btw, in general I am asking. 
I want
* stocking my money safely 
* using it at will (respecting laws and people) 
I don't care that you know what I have, none of it is shameful of to use for bad purpose. 
At the opposite, Swiss account often are used for receiving illegal funds or funding illegal activities. I totally support more transparency from them. And from us states like Nevada that have become world class fiscal paradise (even the economist criticize USA for their hypocrisy on the matter)

To be more precise, currency does not lose value randomly. It is most often caused by bad economic situation. Thus bitcoin by its globalised nature will be more protected from local bad episode but not from any problem

Harnessing eBay growth and power sellers was a smart move from PayPal, a deliberate one to find a niche where they could be the monopole. 
Peter Thiel is a very clever person (top law student before turning to successful entrepreneur and venture capitalist later ). They did all what they could with PayPal because laws trumps technology. I think it is still the case for bitcoin. 
His ability to bet on the right horse so many times in the silicon Valley set him in a very small group. When he decided to back up Trump, he was criticised (his ideas have always been quite extreme, the absolute contrarían) because it was surprising, and because Trump. But Trump won and Peter was the guy who again bet on the correct horse. Fascinating.

If you want some figures about who owns what at countries level, I would oblige, but tomorrow, too late for me. 
The issue is generally badly understood and to often brandished by politicians.

To be fair, there are 2 main differences between the article concept and bitcoin : 
* the bitcoin protocol has spread remarkably quickly and it is actually really famous in a few years. 
* the bitcoin network had been working since day 1 (almost ) while the Wright brother painfully hover above the ground on a few meters. Meanwhile you could go on aerostát high and far. 
I don't believe this article is really related to btc.

Its quantity has an upper limit, which most traded things don't or at a very long term. That is the main difference. Does it matter? Dunno

Op forgot to mention that people have to act on that belief ie buying and selling. The buy and sell is what make the price moves.
The whole sentence is : "if most believe the 3350 is a short recovery, most will sell at this price causing their prediction to fulfill".
Is the same as the holding mentality, since more and more people enter the bitcoin and hold the coins, price can keep raising. That + limited supply makes it bound to rise as long as miners works for coins.

The great firewall is a tremendous success. 99,9% of China is behind and happy. They all looked pretty hooked to their shitty shows when I travel there. 
The great wall was also a quite successful building. It does not stop, it guarded, warned, limited and controlled. Armies stopped armies, and sometimes not. But it was not the last line of defence, only the first. 
Let's rather talk about usa spending in middle east if we want to discuss openness and foreign states meddling.

Ah ah ah, thinking that China has a strong central gouvernement ruling it all is not *wrong* but very inaccurate. China is composed of 17 regions with lots of decentralisation and separation but especially with 17 communist party branches. So it's a permanent inside fight and not all places are equal at all. Conflicting interests result in many policies. 
The western summarised vision is one central governing body but it is pretty inaccurate.
But I am not a China expert

I agree with what you say about their negative view of bitcoin  I believe their opinion is only the directed consequence of their point of view.  Not user, not involved,
