A bit is the basic unit of information in computing and digital communications. A bit can have only one of two values, and may therefore be physically implemented with a two-state device. These values are most commonly represented as either a 0 or 1. 
How could we forget what bits are?

A PRC-backed anti-SegWit (and therefore a less-private Bitcoin) effort is certainly more plausible and evident than the good ol' "Blockstream controls Bitcoin" theory. Just look at the power the PBoC exerts over China's exchanges. Ver himself is pretty anti-USA. Wouldn't be surprised if he is in on the action willingly just to spite Core developers.

Consensus is already reached via nodes enforcing policy...
This is why Roger Ver's bitcoincom mining pool 1.1MB block was rejected by the Bitcoin network and nodes which relayed the &gt;1MB out-of-consensus block were banned.

Miners can mine all they want but as demonstrated by Roger Ver's BU pool, Bitcoin will reject and ban all nodes that generate and relay blocks &gt;1MB.

Consider the control exerted by PBoC over Chinese Bitcoin exchanges. You can logically conclude they do the same for China's miners. I think a plausible theory is that Jihan and company are under the influence of, or completely controlled by, the Chinese government. One can imagine a government like China's does not want an increasingly popular uncontrollable money like Bitcoin to be made practically untraceable. You can extend that conclusion to Bitcoin tracking companies like Coinalytics (now renamed to Skry apparently).

Anything is better at this point.
This is the 5-6th (I've lost count at this point) time bitcointalk has been compromised. That is more than any other bitcoin related service EVER. Bitcointalk has, by far, the worst record when it comes to frequency of fuck-ups.

SegWit does not impact non-SegWit nodes. Soft forks are backwards-compatible. Non-SegWit nodes will work absolutely fine.
On the other end of the spectrum is a BU *hard* fork, which makes all non-BU nodes incompatible, forces everyone to upgrade, and can cause money-loss.

Well, from what I read, the article is more of a "how" than a "why" to tax your transactions. I think for US citizens, the "why" would be so that you won't be subjected to penalties and/or prison time.

You forgo trustlessness by *not* running your own fully validating node. Bitcoin is P2P electronic cash, remember? Not C2B.
@_date: 2017-02-27 16:42:00
Privacy-enhancing projects which utilize SegWit will put Coinalytics out of business. Could that be the reason Garzik is seemingly incomprehensibly anti-SegWit? It would make sense considering a large number of business heads do not like SegWit (assuming here) because it ruins their investment/business model. Atomic swaps deprecate Shapeshift, SegWit-improved Joinmarket/Tumblebit puts Coinalytics and privacy-centric altcoins (Monero, Zcash, etc) out of business -  and that's off the top of my head.

By increasing the cost of shutting down the entire network of transaction-relaying nodes and by also archiving transaction history. 
Also, SPV clients leak transaction data. So, you do have to trust the fully validating node your client is connected to.

That must be similar to how r/btc limits users to 1 post per 10 minutes but whitelists those who clearly support out-of-consensus Bitcoin software forks, making the conversation much more time-consuming and difficult for the limited (read: censored) user.

Non-pruned bitcoin nodes are more costly to run on Amazon AWS and other providers. This is because 100GB+ of storage costs more than ~2GB of storage for a pruned node.

That seems to be what the majority of miners are doing right now. A very large percentage of miners haven't even upgraded past 0.12.x. And there's the discussion between - I think gmaxwell - and a large miner where the miner says their C compiler is not new enough to build 0.13.1...which would mean their C compiler is *old*.

It's free on hardware already purchased eg. your home laptop or desktop. Which is why it's obvious these BU nodes are "fake" - they a) spin up en masse b) are all cloud-based c) are mostly pruned (less costly).

ETH/ETC already demonstrated how difficult and risky juggling the technical risks of a split blockchain can be for exchanges. Remember the Bitfinex CSO (or CTO?) quote: "I wish we never listed this shitcoin." 
BTC-e was replay attacked, Coinbase was replay attacked (IIRC), Yunbi (Chinese exchange) was replay attacked - it was a clusterfuck quite frankly. BTC-e got political with regards to listing ETC. Poloniex listed ETC without sufficient enough time to allow the general community to participate. To have been holding ETH/ETC throughout that whole affair would induce gray hair.

Whether or not Jed is a scammer or pumper, XRP was premined with Jed and company holding billions of it. Nowadays any premined cryptocurrency is almost instantly considered a scam. Currently, Jed can dump only $10,000 (actually, it's probably $20,000 now) worth of XRP per week. So, the facts are that Ripple was premined and now Jed is dumping at least $10,000 per week of XRP that he gave himself.
