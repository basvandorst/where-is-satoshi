Theres a first mover advantage for those who recognize when its time to get out of bitcoin, if that time ever comes. If people think they will lose money, despite all the hodl memes, they will rush for the door. I wouldn't put any faith in thinking bitcoin is too big to fail.

If you have 10 million people over thanksgiving decide to throw $100 at it, thats a billion right there. The global market is many trillions of dollars moving around, a tiny % is accounted for in bitcoin/crypto. I think this run is crazy, but its not hard to account for where all the money could come from.

How much it costs doesn't matter if you think it could gain. 100% rise is good whether you have $10 to double or $10,0000 to double. Pick a coin worth $0.0004 or bitcoin that is $17,000, if you invest $100 in each and they both go up 100%, you end up with $200 worth of each coin. % gain/loss is all that matters.

Just make sure that you have bills paid and an emergency fund. If you don't already have a retirement account, you should at least consider it before you put any extra money into crypto, and determine what % of your portfolio you are willing to risk. Make rules for yourself and stick to them (limit for total investment, monthly contribution amount, when to buy, when to sell). Keep your wife in the loop.

Playing devil's advocate, it wouldn't need to be widely available. If the first and only quantum computer comes into existence before bitcoin is quantum secure, and the guys with the quantum computer decide to mine a bitcoin or hack a wallet, its game over. The type of people to make a quantum computer wouldn't be interested in stealing bitcoin, but they might be interested in proving they could.

Honestly, since they give you the option to use ACH, transfers from coinbase to gdax are free, and they spot you the crypto fees when you send them anywhere, I can't see how people can complain.  
@_date: 2018-06-10 17:00:44
If you watch the video, he is providing more of a clarification that the "fee" in DAG-based cryptos like nano or iota is the work that you have to do before you can add your transaction, because the work has a cost. He is not calling nano or iota scams. 
I'm not sure what examples of cryptocurrency there are that claim to be fee-free in a way where there is zero cost. Staking costs you the work that your money could be doing elsewhere, POW costs you energy, straightforward fees cost you currency, etc. 
In a way what he is saying is self-evident.

Rule  should be don't invest more than you are willing to lose. Given that rule  I would just modify  to say that it is informative to try some day trading with a small amount just so you can see how bad at it you will be (really bad, so bad that you feel like the entire exchange was just waiting for you to put your order in so it could do the opposite). Once you realize how much money you would lose by trying to time the market, it really makes that voice in your head that says "you could totally time it" go away.

Having multiple private channels makes sense to me. It sounds like as the network grows, it becomes more viable to just have one public channel that can reach anyone through the network? Is "channel" equivalent to "node", like can you have one public channel, but be connected to multiple nodes, or is it the definition of the channel to be specific to one node, so that if that node goes down, that channel is also unusable?
@_date: 2019-06-23 11:42:32
I have a question, I havn't tried using lightning yet and only know what i have happened to read about it here on reddit. If I open one of these channels with someone, does that channel connect with all other channels and I can then send bitcoin to anyone on the lightning network? Does anyone only ever need one channel, or do you need multiple channels in order to be able to send to anyone you please?

Sagan gave some modern context, but anti-intellectualism has been a problem for a long time, I'm sure it goes back further than these examples:
Political cartoon [1925](
Hofstadter in [1963](
Isaac Asimov in [1980](
My thought is that there is always a subset of the population that is anti-intellectual for a variety of reasons, but the reason to be upset about it is that there is also always a political group willing to take advantage and manipulate the anti-intellectual crowd to their own ends. Ignorance, religion, racism, xenophobia, or any combination thereof is wielded as a weapon against us. 
@_date: 2019-04-07 22:29:04
Thanks for the great example of anti-intellectualism. Your spurious comparison of modern scientists to priests is just bad. You can't fact check a priest because... God. Scientists get countered and refuted or backed up and confirmed by other scientists, informed citizens, and new data. While many of us dogmatically adhere to a scientific method, there is no scientist held above repeatable experimental results and hard data (if you have an example of one feel free to share). The very definition of science is open thinking because our beliefs are dictated by whichever way the data leads us, superstition does not lend itself to open thinking, though it does not absolutely preclude it either.

Iota on bitfinex are traded in mIotas, each one being 1,000,000 iotas, one mIota being ~$0.60. So with $19 you could get about 30 mIota. On Bitfinex, you can use the green button to have it automatically calculate your max purchase, it sounds like you were trying to buy $46,500 worth with your $19 in bitcoin.

Say GS does this right now and loses a bunch of money, but gain a lot of credibility for their predictions. Later, they 'predict' that bitcoin goes up and then 'predict' it will go down again.

You should think about any investment in terms of return, not how many shares/coins you have. Whether you buy $10k, $1k, or $100 if the market goes up 10%, your investment goes up 10%. 
If your only aim is to get rich from investing $200, then you should buy a lottery ticket, start your own crypto ICO, look at penny stocks, or browse the 7th or 8th page of coinmarketcap for longshots, but that boat has long sailed for bitcoin. 
@_date: 2019-09-23 10:00:20
If I understand correctly, the price and yield of bonds move in opposite directions, so even if you hold a bond with a negative yield, when the rates go lower the price of that bond will go up and you can sell them to someone else. So these companies that hold these negative yielding bonds are essentially making a bet that the rates are going to go lower.

I have been intrigued by the different approaches to crypto like DAG, smart contracts, etc. I read about rootstock, and what they are doing makes it seem like almost any crypto tech can eventually be incorporated into bitcoin in a smooth, non-speculative way. Is there a reason why bitcoin couldn't always just incorporate the best technology?

I see it kind of like a dividend, where if everything is priced in, the only value you can derive from BCH kind of has to come out of BTC, unless people start buying up BCH with new money coming into the market. I'm just a layperson speculating, so I don't back any of this up with any level of expertise whatsoever, so I'm not arguing or anything, just putting a viewpoint out there. If everyone dumps BCH immediately, and its value is negligible, then I would think there would be a negligible change in the value of BTC. 
@_date: 2017-07-30 16:36:25
Theoretically, if BCH has any value, it's should decrease BTC  value once it splits off, assuming BTC is not under/over priced as is.

@_date: 2017-07-13 21:48:58
You have to wait 180 days, then they start paying you your bitcoins in installments over then next year and a half. So you don't get all the bitcoins you buy until two years. My assumption is that within the 180 days, whatever you bought pays for their 20% discount and operating costs to mine about that many coins. Basically you are giving them a 2 year lease on your money while they use it to turn it into more money.
Assuming you were going to buy and hold anyway, that the company is still solvent while they owe you money, and bitcoin value continues to increase or at least stay level, both parties stand to benefit; but those could be risky assumptions.

There was an interesting section in Thomas Picketty's Capital that discussed what large college endowments invested in compared to other medium and small college endowments. The small ones were hundreds of millions and the large ones were tens of billions. They were easier to study because they publish data due to non-profit status or something along those lines. You'll never find that kind of info for private investors. I don't recall what counted as exotic, but I think it was hedge funds, venture capital, etc. I think that book was researched/published sometime before 2013, so probably not much investment in crypto for endowments at the time. I would guess that is not the case today. The interesting part was that contrary to a lot of advice for normal consumers that minimizing fees and diversifying a portfolio to follow the market was the best strategy, the endowments spent more on fees for management (still only around 1% if I recall) as they got bigger, but also had better returns. The better returns presumably came from those exotic investments that the smaller endowments had less of. Not really applicable to individual investors because our timelines are limited and even the most wealthy individuals, aside from maybe the top 500 or so in the world, don't have fortunes comparable to those endowments.

I'm a newb, so I'm only repeating what I have read elsewhere, I would say I have a minimal understanding of most of this.
