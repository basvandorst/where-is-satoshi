possibility of pushing down before pushing higher. but essentially BTC going up :D
@_date: 2018-08-29 16:28:22
yeah agreed! although this took years to come through it is still a good scenario
@_date: 2018-10-03 12:23:22
yeah you can go ahead and download the testnet functional version :)

Number 1 rule in crypto: DYOR &lt;&lt;&lt; Those that have been around will know all about this.
Also...the entire market is between 80-90% down from their ATH prices...are you even up-to-date? 
@_date: 2018-10-03 11:50:49
lol but the marketplace has been released? it just needs to go to mainent now  :) DYOR
@_date: 2018-10-02 23:41:35
TBH with everyone I cant wait to see the Particl Marketplace drop on the MainNet. They have already released a testnet version and it already blows any previous marketplace out of the water.
