Hey /u/ 322gaming1 I am unable to provide you with a list of banks that process bitcoin relates transfers. However, based on our past experience, we have learned that Commerzbank, Deutsche Bank, Standard Chartered, Santander Abby and OTP Bank have stopped processing bitcoin related transfers.
I suggest you contact a bank of your choice and inquire with them on their stance regarding bitcoin related transfers prior to opening an account with them.

Hey please note that what we are trying to establish is what is the origin of the deposited bitcoins and how were they acquired. As every case differs from another we are unable to say in advance which and what kind of documents exactly will suffice until we have received and reviewed them but generally any relevant document which can support your statements on how were the deposited bitcoin acquired should suffice.

While we strive to provide the best possible service to our users, we are unfortunately not privy to internal policy changes of any banks until these decisions affect our clients. Therefore the only way we can learn which banks have refused to process Bitcoin related transfer is through trial and error.
As this is not a precise method, and as banks may change their internal policy, I am unable to provide you with a list of banks that process bitcoin relates transfers. However, based on our past experience, we have learned that Commerzbank, Deutsche Bank, Standard Chartered, Santander Abby and OTP Bank have stopped processing bitcoin related transfers.
