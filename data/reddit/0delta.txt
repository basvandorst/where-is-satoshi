What did you use to send it? If 3MVgJZeMEoBtwvU1nhyJBz2eQPaRBRVq26 is not your address, you are screwed. Electrum would place 'change' to a new address within same wallet...

A) Get a job on Wall St. Or B) Learn to program bots that will make decisions for you. Or C) Buy a little every week/month and hold, don't look at prices every day. Daytrading from home will make you broke and/or crazy ((

This happens in all markets - pros make money off fools/newbies. All you can do is consider your loss a tuition and learn from your mistakes: never believe what is too good to be true and never buy/sell based on emotions.

"I get out near resistance levels. If price breaks that resistance and gets to a certain point I buy back in." So, you sell, then buy higher? ))

My read on the situation: people are not getting their BTC back. They are getting $$ or ¥¥ equivalent of those BTC valued at $300. So no influx of bitcoins to the market. On the other hand, the hackers who stole the actuall coins have been selling all this time...

You know nothing, sorry. Pros spend their lives to make $$ off the guys like you, and off each other. Not all of them succeed all the time. This is a cut-throat business, there is no free lunch. Noone will "teach" you, only scammers will pretend they can.

Coinbase Pro has 0 fee and tight spreads if you can pass verification and use limit orders.

What do they gain by this? Just your email address?

Transfers from exchanges often come in batches, for a few clients at once. GDAX picks up the fee. As long as you received what you sent, all is fine.

Forgive my ignorance, but what is CSW?
