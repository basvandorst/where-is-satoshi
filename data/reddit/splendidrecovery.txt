Nope, that's the right website. I don't know for sure, but historically many AV applications flag Bitcoin software for a variety of reasons; notably, the blockchain has some malware signature in it, triggering alerts.

I have; I think it's going to be a short-lived project. I'm unwilling to buy any ether now as I don't see any applications currently, and therefore I would be speculating - I would never want to invest in something I personally think will fail.
If it doesn't fail, and ether has some application, I may then use it if it fits my needs, and I'm basically guaranteed no loss.

It's possible but largely defeats the purpose - I suppose a purely off-chain system that's occasionally synchronized with the "real" blockchain would work, but you would need one of these for each body or position in space at best. It really doesn't scale well.
In fact, I have a good feeling that hard commodities will be a necessity for interplanetary currency. It's the only medium that doesn't need an active connection to work.
@_date: 2014-08-15 17:51:14
I don't understand what you're arguing here. My statement referred to increased usage resulting in more transactions and more users who must reach consensus. To revert to a given block, it will both take longer to reach consensus and affect more legitimate transactions as the network gets larger, and you risk doing heavy damage to commerce. If you wait until you have enough consensus, you'll reverse possibly tens of thousands of transactions. If you don't wait for enough consensus, you risk creating a hard fork with a critical mass of users on both sides, also interrupting tons of commerce.
This has nothing to do with choosing particular cryptocurrencies - I'm referring to a hyptohetical case where some crypto (but no particular crypto) makes up a large portion of global transactions, say, 3+%.

These are some interesting possibilities. With enough of these sorts of incidents, you'll slowly segregate users of a cryptocurrency to those with similar ideals and those who weren't paying any attention, getting thrown into the neutral, "original" fork.
A last note on this specific instance; one fundamental problem with a cryptocurrency forking is that anyone can use both chains, and both are individually spendable. The prices of both should trend towards an average of one half the original price each - it shouldn't reach that, however, due to irrational players ignoring their coins on one fork instead of maximizing their profit, resulting in less than twice the coins effectively being in existance.
@_date: 2014-11-19 17:58:24
Yes, there are merits, certainly. Otherwise, people wouldn't be pushing it so hard.
The issue is that it just won't fly, I think, with the potential confusion between microbitcoins as "bits" and the other definitions for "bits"; from the similarities between "bits" and "bitcoins", and the lack of clear differentiation; and basically loads of other semantic woes. It's got its benefits but I think we're best of with uBTC/uXBT at the moment as it's considerably less ambiguous.

You could literally just have two bits of wallet software running with the same private key, then try to send using the same inputs at the same time. That's probably the easiest way to go about it.
@_date: 2014-08-08 15:50:08
You're doing your math wrong.
In the case of difficulty, you're taking a percentage increase - in this case, the new difficulty is 105.3% of the old difficulty.
In the case of earnings, you're taking a percentage decrease - in this case, the new earnings are 94.97% of the old.
100 is ~94.97% of 105.3.
EDIT: Denoted rounding.

You could ultimately have something like a weighted "allignment" based off of which forks/blocks to honor. This is ultimately the same as the Vericoin fork and is in essence blacklisting, but I think it could be implemented as more of a *personal colouring* of coins. How exactly to implement this on a per-wallet basis is far beyond me, but I have no doubt there's some way to basically stitch together parts of forks so as to avoid user-defined "malicious" transactions.
Coordinating this would be hell, as would computing such things. Pretty much every coin could be coloured quickly if a large transaction were considered "malicious" and undesirable, and then mixed with other coins constantly.
I really don't feel a system like this would be too useful, as you're either just blacklisting coins that will be inevitably split up and distributed everywhere, or working with multiple forks a-la what's possible by literally just forking right now, but it sure would be interesting to implement.

Again, you're not going about this quite right.
The examples you gave show a deviation from 1000, sure - they're the same deviation by magnitude.
However, this is technically only a deviation in one direction - an increase in difficulty results in a decrease in profitability, by the math the calculator uses. As a result, an difficulty increase of 5% will not result in 5% lower profits - if that were the case, a 100% increase in difficulty would result in 100% lower profits, or 0, obviously not the case.
EDIT: In counter example, if you had 10,000$ with which to buy shares at 1,000$ each, you could buy 10. If the price increases by 20%, making shares 1,200$, you could buy ~8.3 shares and not just 8 (10 - (10/5)) shares.

I believe that if there was a certainty that 50% of all coins were unspendable, the price would very quickly correct itself to wherever it may - no doubt. The issue that a very, very small percentage of coins are verifiable unspendable. At best, most that are "lost" may have lost private keys, but there's no way to be certain someone doesn't have the corresponding key. The very few coins that were destroyed by being sent to an address with a private key that's unfeasible to derive (IE: one for a very specific public key) or impossible to derive would have little impact.

I agree with your notion about "coexisting" - I've heard many claims that altcoins are somehow fundamentally different from Bitcoin, and have fundamentally different applications, and that that is somehow basis for their existence.
Notably, the claim on the lines of "Litecoin is Bitcoin's silver", as if to imply Bitcoin was then "gold." The fundamental difference is that silver and gold can be transacted the exact same way at the exact same time without any issues. You can say "I have three ounces of gold and four ounces of silver," but cryptocurrency doesn't work this way. As far a single system is concerned - Litecoin as an example - you have four Litecoins, but I have no idea how many Bitcoins you have. This requires you to mine on and store two massive blockchains - for what gain? Bitcoin is for all intents and purposes at this price arbitrarily divisible, and almost certainly has enough units to support itself as the sole currency of the world. 
By supporting multiple "coins," you're insisting on the existence and maintenance of multiple blockchains, straining resources for any individual one, and ultimately shafting the system.

It may be democratic, but it certainly is nowhere near ideal. Currencies in general work best when they have a large number of users - the more users, the better. A fork like this in essence would create two incompatible currencies, both substantially weaker than the previous currency.

If 95% of the hashrate is purely for-profit and on the bleeding edge of profitability, less than 95% will drop off if the reward halves and everything else is the same - after awhile of shaking off stubborn laggards, you'll have a little over half the hashrate, not 5%. The difficulty will decrease relatively gradually and blocks may take longer (~15 minutes or so on average) to produce, but there's no reason a majority of miners will suddenly shut down and leave.
Further, even IF there were no stubborn miners, no majority would leave - logic says that if half the Bitcoins are being produced, half the miners can be support, all things being equal.

A major idea of Reddit is to allow specialized subreddits for specific bit of discussions or news sources. As a result, it's best that news stories or ideas be in the most applicable and possibly specific subreddit possible.
That isn't to say that content cannot exist in a specific and a more broad subreddit - however, this particular post and the comments are absolutely and strictly a circlejerk about Bitcoin, and really not a discussion of any real sort.
And if it hurts so much, is actually pretty regularly used - and you'd get a nice half-dozen posts per day if stuff like this that has no real content was there. It has a place, but that place isn't here.

Again, I still hold the notion that a blockchain isn't as useful or powerful as it could be *until* no entity can convince the rest of the network to arbitrarily roll back blocks, through hashrate or through consensus.
I suppose it could be considered fine for a small sort of community; however, a fundamental idea of Bitcoin is that once a transaction is recorded in the blockchain, it is not (or atleast should not be) reversible by any means. You can achieve this by some critical mass of mining and authoritative decentralization.
The purposes for this sake are benevolent, I understand that; I am against theft of any real sort. However, given that I'm against theft, I now have to acknowledge that if these developers can convince the user base to reverse blocks for the sake of stealing my coins, it's entirely possible and feasible. That's against why I use cryptocurrencies in the first place.
@_date: 2014-08-15 15:36:30
You're right, here; and this isn't a black-and-white issue. Despite my feelings that this goes against the intention of a blockchain, I will admit that my first reaction to the news of the theft was "well, shit;" my second response, after finding out about the planned rollback, was something of sedation. It's not an elegant solution in some regards, but it's a solution by any means.
This stuff won't be possible under ideal conditions; if and by the time a good chunk of the world uses a given cryptocurrency, nobody's going to have the authority to convince people to roll back like this. Too much time will pass before the word spreads, if it spreads, and if people are convinced, to mitigate damage from rolling back tons of legitimate commerce. In my eyes, that's a good thing; transactions aren't feasibly reversed, and nobody can expect a bailout like this, encouraging better security under the impression of no fallback.
Perhaps it will simply become unfeasible by the time it becomes more damaging than helpful. Time will tell.
You're excellent in discussion, by the way.

To be fair, the first major rollback Bitcoin saw was to correct a fundamental problem with the client, if I'm not mistaken; ideally, there wouldn't be a problem to begin with, but there was no other way to rectify the issue.
The one in March 2013 is a similar but still different story. The devs could have left things as it is, ultimately damaging the network, but it would have figured itself out at some point, no doubt. The fix for the fork was not *necessary*, but just expedited what would have naturally happened.
Personally, I would avoid the latter case, but advocate the former if it was a necessity. At the same time, I feel the only violation with rolling back NXT is in the spirit of the blockchain system and nothing morally wrong.

No, because SHA-2 hashing involved no floating point computation, and floating point computation is fundamentally different from and not directly comparable/translatable to integer performance.
You could get a rough idea, certainly, by finding an average hash/s*FLOP of a ton of GPU and CPU hardware.
As an example, if you had a 10-petaFLOPS supercomputer, you could get some approximation by comparing it to a 2.2-teraFLOPS AMD 6950 that produces 360-million-hashes-per-second. 
10000/2.2 = ~4545.5, 4545.5 TIMES 360 TIMES 1000000 = ~1,636,363,636,363 hashes per second, or 1.6 petahashes per second.
Please note that this math is largely bullshit; AMDs GPUs after Evergreen have cryptography-friendly instructions, and most supercomputers derive their power from CPUs which for the most part lack comparable instructions. No 10-petaFLOPS supercomputer with manage 1.6 PHS

For cold storage, I have an Ubuntu live CD with Bitcoin-QT's source, and compile QT's source on a RAMdisk. To be safe, I usually take out any wireless adapters and run the system connected to absolutely nothing when generating addresses. For extra safesauce, provide your own entropy from a source you can trust and add that to the entropy from /dev/random, for example.
Then, I just write down the private key and address, and send a small bit to test it; if the transaction goes through, I sweep the private key, and repeat the process, testing it again with a small amount. If THAT goes through, I send whatever amount I intend to store to the address.
If you can be reasonably sure your live CD and source are uncompromised, there's really no point of failure if your written-down private key isn't directly stolen - or atleast, none that I can think of.

Double-spending is possible with absolutely no hashrate whatsoever, and instead systematic and timed - but conflicting - transactions. It's basically a non-issue on the small scale of things - very few are going to go through that trouble at the moment to swindle a convenience store on-the-spot for candies - but for larger in-person transactions or anything online, the deterrence is smaller.

You can't make a cryptocurrency immune to rollbacks; the issue comes from what is in essence centralization in the form of the core devs waving their hands, saying *hey guys, let's reverse all the transactions up to this point because we don't like it*. Yes, it's easily justifiable in this case; the 50? million NXT were presumably stolen, and this would effectively return those stolen NXT. The problem is that ultimately, the devs could potentially rally enough support to reverse whatever blocks they wish, so long as they can pitch it to the community.
This is an intrinsically bad method of going about things, I feel.
EDIT: In response to your other post, you're right in some regards. This was ultimately a *democratic* process, or at least that one of *consensus*, which is what the blockchain system is based off of to begin with. However, this sort of stuff should and will only work on the smaller scale of things, and until it *can't* happen and development/authority is decentralized enough so that *no one entity can pitch an idea like this and possibly expect it to go through*, a cryptocurrency isn't far enough into its lifespan to be fully trustworthy. There's too much power in a single location.
You can still have a functional crypto with other benefits, no doubt, but I feel that so much of the value in a cryptocurrency comes in the as-full-as-possible decentralization of authority and development.

There are two funamental problems with this. First, once your coins have been cryptographically signed to someone else's public key, they belong to the owner of the corresponding private key, and there is no way to then prevent them from transferring those coins to a blacklisted address. You would have to create an entirely different implementation to enforce post-transaction authority over coins. Further, coins that you "own" would not necessarily be yours; a malicious party could blacklist every address that isn't yours, and you would effectively own nothing but a big number that you can't do anything with.
Second, for someone else's coins to play by your rules, they would either need access to the information in "your blockchain" (a-la Window's registry system), eliminating the advantage of segmenting the blockchain for your specific subset or niche, as everyone would ultimately trend towards needing everything; or metadata would have to be attatched to a transaction (a-la .ini files in pre-Windows 95 OSs), acting as a potentially massive bloat as old coins that have cycled through many addresses need to keep metadata from every single blacklist someone may have.
This could also be used to enforce "company stores," where people are paid with coins blacklisting every address except for those their employer controls.
This is turning out to be sort of an altcoin-creation system based on a hyperchain of "master coins." Even if addresses can only be blacklisted (making every other address usable) rather than whitelisted (every other address unusable), the value of any given coin would be based off of what chains it could be used in. If I had a few coins which at some point blacklisted, say, 10,000 American addresses, this would be less useful to me in America than a coin on the base hyperchain or one that only blacklisted a few addresses or those outside of the west.
Everything will quickly become discordant and unusable in an even slightly naive implementation; a big challenge you'd have is keeping everything cryptographically compatible.

I think you may be a little confused on what "confirmations" are.
When you make a transaction, it's pushed out to Bitcoin nodes which will pick up the transaction and put it in an unconfirmed transaction pool. When someone mine's a block (they're running full nodes), they may put that transaction into the block and "confirm" it, and push that block out to other nodes which will accept and record that block.
While ideally every node will have the same chain of blocks, there's no guarantee of this - this is why there are short forks where two chains will compete on length. Most of the time, one chain will win and be accepted by all honest nodes - this is a soft fork. The only real times where one chain doesn't win is a hard fork - one or more nodes uses different rules than "honest" nodes, and blocks made or accepted by these nodes aren't compatible with other nodes.

A Bitcoin transaction, once confirmed, is almost always confirmed forever. The *only* reason it would become unconfirmed is if it happened to be included in an orphaned chain - not too common an occurrence, and even then it would have to also not be included in the longer chain.
There's no limit to confirmations. Those just refer to how many blocks have been made when and after it was included. Every (proper) full node confirms it at a certain point if it's in the longest chain.

I have no doubt that good systems will be in place for this kind of content. As it is in more traditional systems, from what I've gathered of your ideals, sources like TBP can be seen as the major providers of content while platforms like iTunes are sort of optional payment to content creators.
In a majority of cases, though, this doesn't work out very well, as the content from places like TBP is commonly limited in breadth and quality, especially when you get into more obscure media; and iTunes or similar services are middlemen which undoubtedly take a rather large cut before handing money off to record labels who in turn take a rather large cut.
Let's take the music industry as an example. All artists would benefit from an unadulterated income if they had their own methods of personal payment (of course, those with huge volume would want a third party to regulate this anyways); content wouldn't be in any way obligated in label contracts (so you don't have shit like [Love Beach]( nor censored from distributors like iTunes; and ultimately, artists would have as full control as possible of their media and how it was advertised, distributed, priced, and the like.
Of course, anyone can do this right now with no real change or reform of the system - I could register a domain, put together a website, and make a rudimentary Bitcoin payment system for my god-awful noise music - but it would be good to have some infrastructure in place. There aren't too many standard means of truly independent artists to advertise their work in a traditional manner, so if word-of-mouth doesn't do it well, one could pay an advertisement agency that specializes in promoting specific kinds of media to do that work. Platforms could exist that would allow artists to upload and sell their media with some cut for the service provider.
Of course, this sounds a lot like the system already in place, but the key idea here is that these are basically separate entities which can be used entirely independently and with no obligation. This would require both setting these services up, and, most importantly, a change in mindset. There's no reason why this couldn't work for the largest produces of garbage kid movies or an indie artist who throws out a single, two-minute song every decade.

On that last note, it's theoretically possible to undo *every single transaction, ever* by just remining every block, and having a chain with the highest "difficulty".

And thank you for the discussion! I'm interested in working on you with some crypto projects. I'll drop you a line on a different account tonight if that's alright, as I use this one exclusively at work.

Perhaps I'm working a little too strictly on principle alone. There have been quite a few other circlejerk posts - none that really made much of splash - but it's not like it matters too much, as Reddit does run on a consensus system with its voting.

You've never worked with technically incompetent users if you think they'll immediately understand the difference between a "bit" in the sense of 1/1000000 of a Bitcoin and a "bit" in general computing. This term is thrown around absolutely everywhere - megabits in network speeds, word sizes of microprocessors, encryption, and so on. 
These are passable since they all mean the same thing, just applied to different contexts, and users don't have to directly deal with them. They definitely know about them as they're marketing bullet points 'til the end of time, but there's no real confusion arisen because of them. 
However, a "bit" in Bitcoin entirely breaks from that. First, it's expected to be a commonly used term - which, hey, I suppose could work if the entire rest of the system wasn't built around the Bitcoin. Second, which compounds the first and makes it truly an issue, is that this has nothing at all to do with "bits" in the traditional computing sense, yet Bitcoin is strictly a digital currency. I've seen people get confused over the differences between their web browser, make of computer, operating system, and homepages - and none of them are called the same thing. I have no doubts that telling someone to use 256-bit encryption to secure their, err... bits, is going to create more than one issue.
"Bitcoin" and permutations, on the other hand, while reading more like a brand name than "bit", is far less ambiguous because it doesn't share the name of a term for a related system. It conveys its meaning comparatively well.
I understand that the metric system is abstract to most people, especial muh 'muricans, but not too many people haven't heard of a "millimeter" and know that it's smaller than a "meter" due to the "milli-" prefix. Extending this to Bitcoin, most people can immediately understand that a "milliBitcoin" - or "milliBit" as it's going to be abbreviated if the naming convention takes off, I'm sure - is smaller than a "Bitcoin", and the 1-to-1000 understanding will follow soon after.
I agree that using whole Bitcoins won't work for too much longer and that smaller units need to be adopted. However, I think "bit" is a poor choice, and "microBitcoin" is at worst *better*.

I doubt anyone would be willing to do that; Paypal transactions are easily reversible while Bitcoin transactions are not. There's too much potential for fraud.

This would create a really obvious "EXPLOIT ME" sign. Not only are very few of these users going to understand the security implications of having their paper wallets generated on what's almost certainly an online Windows machine, but Coinbase would certainly have many users accessing this feature, giving one of the greatest money-making opportunities you could dream of in the world of hacking.

Far, far more money has been dumped into vaporware and straight-up scams in the Bitcoin world than this - an order of magnitude more, at least. This is nowhere near the first time, and I doubt it'll be anything near the last, unfortunately.
I'm hopeful and optimistic for Etherium, but it's smelling pretty sour.

I acknowledge all of that; my comment was in regards to UlyssesSKrunk making a claim of universality. I hold the notion that subjective things cannot be universally agreed upon while objective things potentially can be.
I don't see the need for the ad hominem, unless I came off the wrong way.
@_date: 2014-08-04 20:41:24
...Possibly because the goal of the Bitcoin community is not to throw money at everyone who needs it, but to support a stateless currency?
Are you also really going to suggest that some Bitcoin users aren't contributing to things like this?
Why so sensationalist?

Even if Bitcoin - this specific cryptocurrency - dies off for whatever reason, the concept of the blockchain has enough potential and applications to fade into irrelevance. This isn't Betamax vs. VHS - a blockchain and a bank-controlled ledger provide fundamentally different functionality.

The USD is not "based on gold." You're probably referring to the Gold Standard where the USD was pegged directly to gold - that hasn't been the case for decades, and ergo is why the USD hasn't gone down with gold.
Technically, the USD is more valuable now than last month in relation to gold.

Pay a large company and fab to design and produce a zillion ASICs, point them at the network, and stall basically every transaction. Bitcoin is quickly strangled into irrelevance.

There have been no transactions to this address at all; most likely you entered the address incorrectly for some reason.

Bitcoin transactions "go through" "instantly" as well, but take longer than that to confirm. I've found the transaction propagation is a little slower than it was about a year ago - they take ~5 seconds rather than nearly no time at all - but it's still at worst comparable to CC transactions.
@_date: 2014-07-31 14:28:39
Like many people have said, there's no real equivalent to FLOPS here at all. Bitcoin mining involves nothing but integer math.

The concept behind an infinitely rigid rod is that you could literally shake one end and instantly have a response on the other - the rod could not change shape or form in any way, causing no delay. An even slightly elastic rod would create a delay of some sort.
If I'm not mistaken, relativity says this isn't possible and you'll always have at best a speed-of-light delay.
Let us dream, however.
@_date: 2014-08-04 17:20:02
This may have been a valid comparison before ASICs were common, but new mining hardware is only capable of SHA2(SHA2(x)) computations. If you wanted to be generous, even, they're only capable of integer computations, and supercomputer performance is usually measured in FLOPS - floating point operations.
@_date: 2014-07-25 20:39:41
I think the biggest issues we have right now in the way of public perception are extravagant claims and the userbase - "instant transactions" being confused with confirmation time, the still-lingering "anonymous currency" nonsense, and the almost undeniable fact that a critical mass of its users are driven in huge part by speculation alone.
It is no doubt useful to anyone, and in-line with anyone with even reasonably strong agorist or anti-state ideals, but plenty of people *myself included* look like bumbling and insane fools.
@_date: 2014-08-21 15:24:03
This is patently true!
@_date: 2014-08-01 17:56:14
I think you're kind of missing the issue. No purpose-built software packages should ever be used for the storage of Bitcoin. Individual pieces of software individually reviewed and installed may be acceptable - that requires far less trust - but there's no reason ANYONE with a properly skeptical mind should trust an entire operating system built and installed by someone who knows about Bitcoin and built said operating system to pitch it for a wallet-storage solution.
I understand what you're trying to do - I truly believe you're benign. However, people have to be skeptical when storing something like a Bitcoin private key. All you would need is, say, a small modification to Electrum to sign every transaction with a certain public key instead of the indicated one, and you'd steal the output of EVERY SINGLE transaction made with the system. Most people would be none the wiser until after their money is gone.

No, but you can either Google your problem or ask someone in the community. What kind of problems are you having?
EDIT: Some context. There is no Bitcoin "support number or e-mail" simply because Bitcoin has no company or entity attached to it. If you're using a service like Coindesk, for example, you can contact them for specific information on your issue.

I've shown her before, but two massive roadblocks are coin acquisition and coin security. I'm reasonably certain those two factors alone can entirely hold Bitcoin back.

The horse didn't say that after observing the network in this kind of real-world use. It's a useless observation, in my opinion, as a result.

The problem doesn't lie in pre-generated keys, but potential backdoor or malicious software. We have no real way to know what you did with the system, therefore we have no reason to assume you're honest.
EDIT: *doesn't
@_date: 2014-08-01 20:37:42
Yeah; I should have specified that in my original post. Either way, I feel it's possible to trust stuff like this, but only with absolute transparency. Even then, each individual would be unwilling to review all of the hardware and the code used - therefore they would have to trust others to review said code.
I think the only truly "secure" systems are ones which were designed without Bitcoin in mind whatsoever - a vanilla Ubuntu installation, for example - with no connection to the internet and an absolutely basic Bitcoin wallet implementation for review-ability's sake. I personally trust Electrum with my funds as I feel it's been sufficiently reviewed by others and I've pretty extensively read the source myself (mostly to learn about how to write my own wallet implementation).
@_date: 2014-08-01 20:33:46
What method exactly are you using to calculate "volatility"?
The other source shows 0% volatility when the price begins and ends at the same value - basically, it shows a delta in the price, not total movement in the interim.
