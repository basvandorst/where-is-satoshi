@_date: 2015-06-06 08:26:25
they just want to know exactly what people are buying, theyll make 10 times the fee in targeted advertising. Its incredibly powerful to give google that info.
@_date: 2015-06-07 07:25:51
thats like 90% of what people buy. In my opinion thats as great as your searches. 
@_date: 2015-06-08 21:47:55
im up a good amount. ive invested in about 20 loans. I have had a few late payments, and thats really frustrating. Also one guy just flat out hasnt paid. Theres plenty of risk. However if you take your time, look into potential loans, and spread your money around its a pretty safe process to ROI. 
Also one thing that i didnt realize. You can loan in bitcoin or the USD equivalent. So be careful to understand the risks of loaning in both. 
@_date: 2015-12-23 02:40:15
Last year they had a cool feature for Christmas where you could print out Bitcoin Christmas Cards easily from their site with a reference number. The reciever only had to create a coinbase account and type in the number, and bitcoins were instantly transferred into their coinbase account. It was a lot more simple than the paper wallet  process.
@_date: 2015-06-07 07:17:08
Right, thats why I said "crude example", but lets stick with it... Theres a lot of new online groceries that are popping up like Peapod, and Fresh Direct. Youre right, most people buy their toilet paper from local stores. But now google sees that youre buying lots of toilet paper. Fresh direct uses google adds...Now youve got an add that pops up "50% off toilet paper if you use Fresh Direct"... Maybe you change your mind about buying toilet paper locally.
I understand how google targets consumers now. How do you not see how more information on what youre buying doesnt help them even more in targeting? And they know the frequency with which youre buying... Thats a huge difference from targeting from searches, and online buying.
@_date: 2015-12-23 20:33:09
yea, but the "gift" aspect is sort of lost if its just me shooting them 30 bucks via email. 
@_date: 2015-06-07 00:51:39
Well theres a thousand simple wallet apps that make sending bitcoin easy...  Getting the bitcoin seems to be the aspect that most new users cite as  an inconvenience. Coinbase.com is all inclusive for buying/sending/ selling for cash. You have to set up a bank account, and creditcard to buy bitcoins instantly which takes some time, but if you and the person your sending them to take the time to set up wallets... It should be the seamless process youre looking for to send money.
Coinbase has a wallet app. other bitcoin only wallet apps that people love are.
Android -&gt; Mycelium
iOS -&gt; Bread Wallet 
TL;DR - Use coinbase, its safe. Take the time to set up everything up (including a verified creditcard), and youll have the best/fasted experience with bitcoin.

@_date: 2015-06-06 23:22:27
With this theyll see a lot more of what youre actually purchasing. Thats different from targeting from your searches and online buys. You said they have that info, they dont.
Crude example:
I buy toilet paper from a store with a google payment terminal. Theyll take that info, then they can advertise for online toilet paper companies or online grocery stores in three weeks when they think ill need toilet paper again.  
The targeting can be more accurate with the more info you have.  
@_date: 2015-12-23 02:42:41

Look if bitcoin can find a market in the black community through  word of mouth  like this video, then it's an avenue... We need mass adoption, if bitcoin becomes cool it will be through video  blogs and tips like this... This is how we get users. This is how it spreads.

It was just a joke, and what is the definition of an Idiot? I assume you're calling me one. Bitcoin is something I believe in, because it has the ability solve a lot of economic issues in countries with poor economies. It is as much an investment as it is support of the movement. Ill never actually care that much about money.

This is my number one approach if you actually want to attract people to accept Bitcoin. Give them some extra incentive. My go to line for trying to get store acceptance is "Id be in here a lot more often" or "id give you more of my money".
Its not "Hey you can save money on credit card fees" Or " its the future, and transactions are quicker". People have been far more curious when I mention the extra money id be willing to spend in their store.

Thats fair, I agree with you on tipping, and convincing people. Its rarely is successful. But actively trying to get some merchants and services to accept doesnt strike me as a bad thing. Id like to be able to spend them somewhere. Also understand that 90% of the world have no clue what bitcoin is. I asked half the stores in my neighborhood, and all but one had no idea what I was saying.

@_date: 2014-12-17 04:14:39
look no further than Alts... Most are trying very ambitious ideas, and many pull through with advancements, but nobody is adopting any of them. Bitcoiners groan when someone even mentions one. Why? because bitcoin has the market cap, and thats what drives infrastructure. Ive heard the CEO of Bitpay say that if a coin were to overtake bitcoin then theyd switch to accepting that coin. You need it to be valuable for VC to invest in apps and exchanges and hardware. The more money its worth the more attention it gets.

I'm not making an argument against bitcoin being better interms of  inflation. I agreed with you, sir. But, you've yet to address my argument that bitcoin is no where close to the dollar/ current banking system in terms of ease of use and benefits for a consumer. That's why America will fall behind in adoption compared to remittance and unbanked markets.

I'm saying the volume was fake.  So your one hundred dollars isn't what it seems to be... You can generate high volume to attract ignorant investors who buy and hold. You can continue to buy through fake walls that you're setting up... People see the huge sell walls fall, and  see it as a bullish sign. Then you follow that up with a 2 million dollar pump... Wait, and repeate that 12-15 times. The price will rise, and you'll get massive volume from buying your own walls. People think massive volume is a sign of new investors, they also see the green bars, and boom you've started a pump.
This is an environment in which bitcoiners think the price can blow up at anytime, you can trick people into buying. If you you pump the price with 2 million dollar buys in spurts, and chew through fake sell walls .... It's not as farfetched as you're making it out to be. It's a market full of hopeful people that are novice to trading.
@_date: 2014-12-19 09:19:07
I actually bought more  a couple weeks back.  Right after Dev retracted his IPO.... I'm going to hold, because that community has been pretty great, and I've held for so long. That community paid me back in fun and effort. I'll ride that coin untill it gains traction or hits the floor.
I'm done buying  alts untill the market shows it's not completely based on pump and dumps... Bittrex got absolutely ridiculous... The markets not big enough right now...But yea, if  majika  could ever finish AeroMe then I'll come around to say hey... try out the platform. It's essentially bitbay, but not a scam as far as I can tell.

I know the bowl itself is shit, but it is visibility, and if it goes well with merchants and the fans then it can leave a better impression than a risky investment in internet money....It can make bitcoin look more legitimate to the entire city of Tampa.

@_date: 2014-12-14 18:17:28
look you don't have to convince me that printing off 1T dollars a year is a bad thing, but it won't ruin the economy any time soon. We might see another recession, but you won't see the US economy collapse like the Great Depression. There's too many strong global companies here. 
When I say trustworthy strong and respected...that's compared to all the other currencies. Is there another currency you'd prefer? Do you want the euro with the issues in Greece? Or maybe the yen with massive issues in the working class? The ruble with putin fucking things up? The dollar looks pretty good to me right now.

I think it was a joke. But if your question is serious... Then I guess it would support bitcoin in a very small way. I think Microsoft instantly liquidates  their coins on bitpay, so it would actually hurt the price slightly, but it would show up in bitcoin sales for Microsoft which everyone will be curious about (including companies on the fence of accepting bitcoin), and the purchase of the bitcoin is  also supporting the exchange it's bought from. 
@_date: 2014-11-15 22:33:45
Right, but  in my explanation your whale buyer is my group of manipulators. If they stop buying and sells the coins they bought on the pump the price then the pice will drop, and he'll make money on all the buyers who bought and held. People have admitted to doing it in alts... And you can add a few rumors on reddit and the forums to help your cause. All you have to do is get people to match the amount of money you use to pump. If others continue to buy at a higher prices then there's a lot of money to be made.
@_date: 2014-12-20 23:43:04
Yea, but there's some zeal in thats just as extreme... It's part of the reason why I'm living off bitcoin next year. There's so much energy in the fight for or against bitcoin. I find it quite fascinating, and I'm excited to see how everything shakes out. Personally I love what bitcoin represents, and the blockchain is pure genius, but I think some fear is warranted. 
It's the internet too, you gotta shake off the negativity, let it forge you into a better person. "It's a baptism by fire"... I think Paris Hilton once said that, or maybe batman... One of the two.

Thanks Nobody, Im going to write one about giving bitcoin for christmas (I used coinbase)... Like I said before, I like reading your comments, always on point and funny...and they make me think about my response.
Yea, the VC cant last forever. I think it comes down to merchant acceptance and actual user growth over the next two years... It has to build enough to keep VC interested, and holders alone cant keep all these companies afloat... Theres way too much money involved, and too many startups.  
Thats really the tipping point for me, and thats why I disagree with OP. I think Bitcoin must find reasonable adoption (1 million users +) to actually keep merchants interested, and have the price rebound and grow. If all we are is a bunch of holders, and theres no actual bitcoin environment...well then yea, its going to be rough to keep people interested.
 Ive got thoughts on how this happens but this is feeling too long for a comment. Yes, im not blindly optimistic, a lot of work needs to be done for bitcoin to grow, and it needs to happen sooner than later. 
@_date: 2014-12-11 00:15:57

I'm sure you'll get some answers along the lines of it's not decentralized, and they can make as many coins as they want... I don't know... It seems to be working decently. it's hard to say if it can survive if bitcoin shows some life and rises above 1k... It's one alt that might have a future.

Everyone thinks the funding rounds will last forever, because bitcoin has massive potential, but it's a bubble tech space just like any other.

Bitwage, get paid in bitcoin...I just joined and I would like more merchants. It's easy for a holder to say "this is how we grow the bitcoin economy" but unless you're actually living off bitcoin, how do you really know what's needed? I'm going all in 2 paychecks from now (that's how long it takes to switch direct deposit with my employer)... And right now I'm going to have to rely heavily on gyft from what I'm seeing. I'm in NYC.

I think circle or coinbase or bitpay should have machines... I think if you could do cash to bitcoin... Then you'd attract new users.
I think people unfamiliar with bitcoin are reluctant to do a credit card or or bank account. You want a machine that allows cash to be deposited for bitcoin (with an ID to verify identity).

Do they have to do transaction on the blockchain is the question...if all you're doing is remittance then couldnt you avoid the need? Just build your own network like coinbase or changetip... everyone who signs up has wallet and as long as each western union location has local currency...then you dont even need to move the coins out of the western union network. They just operate as a brick and mortar exchange...assuming nobody wants to keep their bitcoins in bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-11-29 09:17:53
If you're going to sell it comes with fees... And at that point you only have money. So why do it? Its a smarter investment to buy stocks or something that can increase in value. Or if you want materialistic things like lambos or large swimming pools or jet airplanes...well then just buy lambos or large swimming pools or jet airplanes with Bitcoin.

Alright, so I think ive got a really good idea... so what youre going to want to do is open up another credit card...Theres a website called circle that allows people to buy Bitcoin with credit cards. go there, and max out the credit card on Bitcoin. After thats done, open up another card and do the exact same thing. Now you're going to have to repeat this until you can no longer open up a new credit card. At this point you should have a shit ton of Bitcoin. Now hopefully the price rises, you triple your money and you can pay off your debt. 
@_date: 2014-12-01 19:49:33
Bitcoin needs to find a bottom level economy in the large remittance markets. If people can just receive and spend Bitcoin without having to change it into their native currencies then its a game changer, and worth the 10x in price.

uhh circle? or are you talking about no ID, just give me bitcoins for cash?
@_date: 2014-12-24 08:19:12
Right, that's happening right now... There are too few actual users to support the growing number of merchants. I've heard merchants talk about never making a bitcoin sale....I mean they'll wait, because they realize the potential, but there is a time frame. I think bitcoin really needs to capitalize on highly publicized events... People scoffed when I wrote a post about the importance of the bitcoin bowl, but these are the events we need to use to attract new users. I'll be watching the event very closely ...This is a chance for bitcoin to change perceptions, and educate people. If it's flawed; merchant issues, change tip issues, ATM issues, jokes from analysts... I don't think it can kill bitcoin, but it's a blow. It's one more thing for us to have to defended. I only have so many "this is actually a good thing"s in me. It would be another weakness for doubts to grow on. Now I know bitpay will have their shit together... I just hope trucoin, and changetip do too.

Ive heard the theory, and i even believed that the "this is gentleman" rise was manipulated.

I always here about the unbanked people of the world and the remittance possibilities. Theres so much talk of bitcoins potential, and the companies working to enter those markets....Id actually like to see if bitcoin is helping africans, or south americans, or filipinos right now, and which companies are involved.

Yea it is kind of a late statement. I do think a decentralized blockchain does have certain advantages over current systems, but I think you're right in the point that the idea of digital money is nothing new. I feel like the only reason he made the statement was because were probably going to see a lot of larger companies are going to test out bitcoin this year...he'll probably stroke his ego for something that's become obvious now that Microsoft and time have moved into the space. To me it seems clear that 2015 will be a bigger trial year.... With paypal and eBay. This seems really obvious that it's at least going to be tested out.

I joined bitwage last night. I won't take my full salary in bitcoin, but I'd prefer to be completely cashless. That's the incentive for me. I no longer want to hoard bitcoins... Since merchant acceptance doesn't have a huge effect then I'm willing to become a part of the bitcoin ecosystem.  The system is just better than cash and banks. Yea, I hope the price doesn't drop like a rock, and I understand it's really early, but I like a decent risk, and this looks like the beginning of a tidal wave. I see most American companies accepting bitcoin by the end of 2016.

Coinbase.com offers it, you gotta set up a bank account, but it will let you set up buys like that... Automatic reoccurring daily, weekly, monthly buys.

The jokes dont bother me. Its Reddit, I enjoy them. I didnt post this thinking, "Everyone is going to upvote me, look what a great job I did with my parents!". I know it has a long shot at being successful, but as an economic concept its more than just "marginally interesting". A global currency that can be sent around the world in seconds has a vast amount of potential. I understand that in large economic powerhouses like the US, yes, its not as impactful, but when you look at 3rd world or even non democracies...Thats where Bitcoin gets interesting to me. Obviously it has to gain traction, but yes, if it did gain world wide popularity then you're giving a lot more control and safety in remittance markets (yes bitcoin needs to work on security)... Africans across the continent are being ripped off by banking systems. You could do a lot of good there with a free global monetary system. South America is another good example, Argentina has a currency even more unstable than bitcoin... you would put a larger amount of power in the hands of the people with bitcoin. I know these are vague examples, but I can rebuttal a "I got my parents to by bitcoin post for hours on end... Just think about countries with miserable economies, just take a day, and then tell me how widespread bitcoin use would have a minimal effect on those countries.

Well, it says that there is a "fair fee" for sending the coins, so maybe the exchange is free, but the actual sending of coins will come at a price? And maybe more expensive the faster you want the coins.
 
I guess if the trading is free then the incentive to use the sending service is there...and thats where they make their money.

Id say try and find a guy willing to sell you a car for bitcoins first, then buy bitcoins right before your trip, first day you're in Argentina buy the car. If you can't find someone willing to sell you a car for bitcoins then I'm not sure it's better than a regular non bitcoin process

You claimed you were a realist... My points were arguing against that. If you disagree that big bank apps and credit cards are easy/useful for consumers... And that most of the world has confidence in the US dollar, well, too me, that makes you not a realist. Perhaps a futurist is a better way to describe yourself.
@_date: 2014-12-14 07:20:06
Are you really laughing out loud? Are you that pompous of a bitcoiner? 
You're right, a slow 1% inflation over roughly 100 years has lead to a 99% loss in value. But it's value isn't going to tank much more than 1% in a single year. You make the proper argument, you're right, but you fail to recognize that the majority of the American public couldn't give a fuck about the fact that you're right....they trust the 1% inflation more than bitcoin, because they see that the value has been halved in the last year, and and bitcoins are a difficult and awkward process for new users. There's a learning curb. These are issues for bitcoin in America. Why do the dollar hating purists continue to ignore this? We need to work on a solution to these problems, not laugh at them because there's an argument that can be made.
@_date: 2014-12-15 21:50:31
i still dont get how sending a dollar in bitcoin helps this guy with his problem, hes not asking for donations... he just wants to get money out of Russia. And he doesnt even have a changetip... people tried to start this on the original. gave him $1.33 that he didnt collect.
@_date: 2014-11-26 04:06:21
if you can operate in a grey area for 4-5 years then the economy will grow around it. If it undercuts Western Union then locals will begin to trade in bitcoin, and merchants will accept it. Eventually you wont even need rebit.

The only serious flaw for the future is security... I think bitcoin will find markets in countries with large amounts of unbanked people. I also think merchants will come around to accepting it. But, as the price rises I only see an increase in attempts to steal. If one bitcoin is worth eventually worth 10k or 100k then why wouldn't you try to hack coins with low security?
@_date: 2014-12-01 18:18:51

@_date: 2014-12-18 08:24:18
Yes, as long as you're willing to set up a bank account and paying slightly above market price (2-3 bucks per coin) then coinbase is a great site for buying and holding long term. Understand that it's not an exchange, so even though you buy and sell at a locked price it does take a few days to actually make the transaction and get your bitcoins... So if you're looking to day trade this is the wrong site to use. Personally, I've never had an issue with the service they offer. I've bought and sold many times without a single issue, and always feel safe about my coins. It's also extremely easy to use. You will have to have your phone handy when signing in... They text you an additional password upon sign in for extra security. Also they have a "vault" function  if you choose to "vault" your bitcoins, then there is a 48 hour process with multiple email confirmations to take coins out of the vault... It's tedious to get coins out of the vault, but it's another security feature coinbase offers. 
Also I should note they do have daily limits for the amount of coins you can buy...but you can increase that limit to $50,000 if you're willing to verify a creditcard along with your bank account. People have complained about this process, but coinbase is all about security... They're big on safety for everyone. This also allows you to buy 1,000 dollars worth of coins instantly a week, which can be used right after purchase. 
@_date: 2014-12-16 00:24:20
Well US banks average around 1% intrest.... Russia just hiked to 17% interest. Which is great if the Russian Ruble holds value, but it puts a tremendous amount of pressure on the banks. Ive never heard of a hike like that, so im slightly stunned, and confused. I have no idea what this would do to a country. It makes it really appealing to hold Russian money if you believe the Russian economy and banks wont tank. Its just balsy as fuck with the amount of sanctions currently on the country.
@_date: 2014-12-23 07:07:01

Interesting. If you did have bitcoin would you treat it as an investment, or would you try and use it?
@_date: 2014-12-01 22:31:14
well thats for an atm at 10%-15%, and thats based on the machine not working... yea the machine has to work, no shit, but you cant pretend that a well working 1% atm wouldnt create good traffic from bitcoiners, and be more attractive to new users. If there was a 1%-2% atm that worked in my area I would use it for 90% of my bitcoin buys.

@_date: 2014-12-20 19:59:24
The coin devs arnt necessarily involved...sure people have done the premine pump then dump, but I've seen pump groups inflate coins based on project promises that actually followed through. 
Buy up a coin for 100 satoshi on polinex for a week...Get on bitcoin talk, act like the coin is the next big thing. Coin gets added to bittrex, pump the price on bittrex and quickly 5-20 times your money. Then drop all shares on the slightest good news. People have admitted to it. There's no need to develop a coin when you can buy one for fractions of a penny then hype an unfinished feature that the coin is working on. There were at least 20 cons striving for completely anonymous transactions... They all got inflated and dumped before actually completing any legitimate feature. Look at dark, it's not a scam, but the price went to 15 bucks a coin while preparing the master node functionality. What happened when they finished? Price tanked. Hype scammers dumped. But it all works, there's no issues with the tech.
@_date: 2014-12-13 02:03:46
its my belief that good news doesnt have much effect, because not enough people are interested in buying bitcoin (either from not knowing or not caring). as adoption goes up youll see a bigger effect from good news...
@_date: 2014-11-15 23:03:43
No they all  pumped and sold as a group just like  people have admitted to doing in alts... If you get people outside the group to join in then you make their money. The price is decided upon before hand... The pump is started. The excitement builds (which the group often stokes with optimistic posts) the price continues to pump as the  group buys through their own sell walls.... Excitement really starts to build. Then on the pre determined price everybody sells for what they can.

Yea Rydan, because I threw out numbers in my comment... And I talked about the past 6 months in the comment above, right?  But let's go this route... I'll bet you the price of a bitcoin (377) that bitcoin doubles in value in 2 years and out grows gold.
@_date: 2014-12-12 20:53:15
there are also a lot of ways to increase security of your coins too. you should treat your hot wallets like your actual wallet... dont carry around 50k in bitcoin where hackers can get to it.

A world currency is a very romantic notion. Some people want to turn bitcoin into a revolution, you know? Overthrow the system! The idea of bitcoin attracts an ecletic group, and many people here are sane... but the crazys get the attention, and their posts get remembered.

ive earned a good amount from tipping and answering questions. I got tipped 20/10/5 bucks before, theres also people make requests there and sometimes pay in bitcoin. I also just joined bitwage. If more merchants adopt bitcoin in the new york area, then id go cashless. All I really need is a CVS, Ibbys fallafel (restaurant),  and a few bars that I frequent to accept, and id go cashless. Im a simple man.

Yes his spelling isn't perfect, and he doesn't see the full picture, but fuck off if you think this isn't great for bitcoin. He's a new user, and I gaurentee hell  promote the fuck out of bitcoin within his community.

I'm not complaining, and I'll make money off it.  I delt with it correctly. I bought below 360, and I'll buy at a low this time. It's not trading. Look at the dump... See those subsequent spikes that get lower and lower? That's manipulating to catch people trying to buy the rebound. Ultimately I'm a holder, but I think I can make a lot more coins playing the manipulation.
@_date: 2014-12-20 23:47:28

I posted about a "bit drop" a few days ago...I basically came up with the idea to "make it rain" in bitcoin... A changetip that would release a designated amount Statoshi on clicks, but restricted it so someone couldn't click twice. Not exactly the same idea, but another way to get new users interested.

What bank do you use? Chase is pretty damn convenient if you have a creditcard debit card and their phone app. Look I'm all for bitcoin, and I signed up for bitwage... But bitcoin is not competing with chase or other big banks anytime soon for the savings and spending accounts of most Americans.

If you're new to alts. Then there are quite a few coins with better privacy. If you're looking to promote monero then that's cool too. I like Aerocoin because AeroMe is going to drop soon, and the price should at least triple, but there' are great things going on in alts.

thanks for the tip, I think its a situation where, as a bitcoiner, I hope merchants see the benefit of accepting Bitcoin over credit card, (they dont have to pay the fees with bitcoin that they do with creditcard) and then it becomes as universally accepted as cash. If that happens then bitcoin would have a unique versatility (part credit card part cash) with no third party involved to fuck you over... ive lost so much money to overdraft, bank fees, rejected checks that ive accepted... its just faster and cheaper than banks, and credit cards. The system behind bitcoin, thats the real gem.

Well that's the thing, am I nervous about bitpay circle or coinbase? No... The big names in the space will get funded for as long as they need. Coinbase might actually be profitable right now. I know they received 400 million in funding, but I think they could be profitable if they wanted to.  
but what about the others? celery, coinkite, bitaccess, gocoin, zip zap, gem, chain, ect... That list is a mile long. And the competition grows daily. It's a fucking gold rush of epic proportions...I'd say half are gone in 2 years if bitcoin can't grow to 1 million + users...and that's low side. I seriously believe you need 5 million active users to keep most of these startups  from going  belly up. A lot of them overlap functionality, and many of them just flat out won't be useful. It's a sexy space, but it won't continue to be when companies begin to go bankrupt. 
@_date: 2014-12-10 23:58:13

It's worked better for scammers in a lot of cases, because people eventually caught on, and distrusted coins with IPO offerings or premines... So scammers looked for cheap coins with a decent dev...they could get an altruistic dev working his ass off on some untested feature...and pump the price by praising his great work as the next best thing. So theyve got a dev showing progress, and everyone trusts him, and meanwhile they're pumping rumors, and creating large fake volume on bittrex... Slowly rasing the price by buying their own sell walls. And then boom, the price spikes right before the planned release date... Then they dump it on the news. That's easy money in a market where everyone is trying to get rich. A lot of novice traders see a coin going up slowly, jump on the bandwagon then never get off. Bag holders. 
I bought alts for a while. I still hold a lot of aero black and dark... I got turned off because these pumpers did this to almost every good coin. Devs were working on cool features but these ass holes destroyed the market for the most part. I no longer trade. 
But yea it's upsetting to hear you and most bitcoiners accuse alts as scams. A lot of these devs are in it for the love  of crypto, and their good ideas are destroyed by  pump groups. Nobody wants a coin that's been pumped and dumped... Even if it's got great useful features.
I think we all should take a better look at alts, many of them will eventually be the ground work of new side chain features. I also think that if bitcoin does go mainstream there will be room for other coins just on the sheer volume of transactions... there will be room for faster leaner coins, and they won't be in direct competition with bitcoin, because the bitcoin network will be so large and useful because of infrastructure.

well bitcoins are generally in season during months that start with J... so January may yield a great crop for buying. I like buying directly from the miners to guarantee freshness.

youre partially right op, the merchant incentive is much better than the consumer incentive in average joe cases...BUT you fail to see the potential of bitcoin in situations outside of Average Joe scenerios... The remittance markets arnt apart of average joe territory and neither are the unbanked. I think were likely to see popularity increase in 3rd world countries, before it makes its way to main stream US adoption. the process is a long one, and I dont see anyone getting rich in 2015, but this will build slowly and then finally click for everyone someday.

Is it really that delusional when theres hundreds of millions of dollars in VC funding?

Right, op gets it. These college kids prefer to have US dollars because they can't spend bitcoin everywhere. They don't care about decentralization, they just need money quick. I think this is sentiment is the same for most Americans. They want US dollars quickly. They really don't care that much how it's being transferred to them.
 I'm getting down voted, but you guys are ignoring the fact that most people don't care how their money is handled here in the US. It runs pretty damn smooth here for consumers. They can go get a rewards credit cards and earn points... Actually make money back. That's something that bitcoin can't really offer. At best consumers might be able to get deals on bitcoin purchases in the future.

Let me put it this way, Would you invest in a stock thats down 60% in the last year and rated as the worst investment of 2014? I know were up huge in the 2 year, but the mainstream doesnt care, all they see is crash. I just think if we could break the bear market, and start to climb bitcoin would look a lot more appealing. we need more than 200-500k users...if all these startups dont see adoption then they will fail.

It depends on how youre going to use them. If youre looking to save them forever and ever. Paper wallets or a hard drive is probably the safest. If you want to spend them or send them to people then an online wallet is your best bet. 
Ive used coinbase.com for almost a year and havent a single issue with security. There are many ways to keep your coins safer with 2 factor Identification and the Vault service they offer. People gripe about buying on the site, but its safety hasnt really been questioned. 
There are different issues with all forms of bitcoin storage. external could crap out, computers can crash or be hacked or get stolen. I trust Coinbase more than I trust myself with the other options.

I get that, but it would increase the popularity of the store that your ATM is in. I know its a rather expensive promotional device, but if youre in a big city, and you love bitcoin...Then I dont think its too much of a loss as long as youre making some money off it. 
@_date: 2014-12-18 04:32:45
you want it to be faster and cheaper... each store location has an amount of bitcoins on their network (like change tip). So customer  x walks in... needs to send money to friend Y at another western union location.  He gives western union 20 bucks...that western union sends their bitcoin to the other location (off the blockchain, like changetip). Western union location 2 sees the transaction instantly and gives local fiat to friend Y. Throw a fee on both sides ... Theyve got the advantage of having thousands of locations, and being well known. I think a 1% or 2% fee is reasonable.

I think we're always going to have trouble in the US with user adoption. You can transfer money with a chase checking account  to any bank account in the country for free, venmo, snap chats got a thing now, and of course...apple pay. The competition will always be harder to overcome here, because the American dollar is so trustworthy. Why stop using it? There are reasons, but none that are incredibly important to most Americans.
What I'm looking for is users in remittance, and unbanked markets over the next year. If it's slow and adoption is poor in those places... Then I'll start to worry. The start ups are still starting up... so I'd say give a year and look at the rest of the world rather than the US. Bitcoin is the world currency.

you're absolutely right, 1/25 of the companies involved in Bitcoin will make it. The other 24 will fail. But the Bitcoin space itself isnt going anywhere. Its already grown enough to prove its going to be valuable in remittance markets. Unless its outlawed world wide, or Apple Pay wants to get into Africa and South America (which isnt happening)...Then theres some serious room for Bitcoin to grow and find users. Its really not that delusional.

@_date: 2014-12-15 23:34:48
well the problem is most companies that agree to accept bitcoin dont keep their bitcoins... they instantly sell them for cash with services like bitpay, so bitcoin needs to increase adoption to the point where the extra coins on the market. Also if adoption becomes fairly widespread those companies who have been selling may start to see the potential of keeping their coins. 
Also miners have a lot to do with the price, a lot of miners sell their coins to pay for the cost of electricity....and that accounts for a lot of new coins on the market. But, that could also change if the price goes up, or more people enter the market to buy those coins. 
TL;DR: yes, but we need to cross a threshold... Theyre currently are not enough users to to get over the initial hump of coins being put on the market from mining, and companies that sell their income of bitcoins.

Ok, A. If a VC funded company goes bankrupt then that's a big loss and looks bad for their firm. B. Just because you are part of a fund doesn't mean you can't lose a substantial amount of money (I used the word investors  above), and C. yes, venture capitalists can use their own money to fund projects
"A venture capitalist is a person who makes venture investments, and these venture capitalists are expected to bring managerial and technical expertise as well as capital to their investments." That's the ole Wikipedia. There's no definition on where that money has to come from.

I'm invested in a few... Who knows? It's always nice to have options, and most have the ability to be integrated into the bitcoin infrastructure very easily. I also picked coins working on their own infrastructure (blackcoin, and aerocoin) because I eventually see the platforms their working on becoming useful, and used by other coins. For me it's just betting on developers, and those two coins have great ones. 
@_date: 2014-12-24 03:22:15
Yea, I mean, people site bitcoin for legitimate problems as if its the holy grail, and OP is saying its so good that people will just come. Were a long way out from just sitting back and relaxing. Is there a wrong way to approach people? Yes.  Most people don't care, and ignore you, but there are situations and ways to approach people about bitcoin. 
In theory all of the start ups, ATMs, and trading sites should make bitcoin simple, and easy to obtain, but theyre not doing the best job right now. The startups need verification, the ATMs are too expensive, and the trading sites are kind of sketchy. 
I think we have a good 2 years before bitcoin is actually appealing to the mainstream. Everybody needs to swallow the fact that its not that attractive in its current state. Personally, Im treating it as a hobby... I think many people here are the same way. Im legitimately interested in the Tech, and that why I buy and use it... The real step is seeing if people who need it actually benefit from using bitcoin. How easy can we make it...

I agree, it's rough. I just want places near me to accept, so I can actually use mine. I genuinely believe we're at or near the low in price, I bought enough in the low 3s. I just want to spend some to give merchants incentives to tell others. I understand that paying more than what I would like is a ridiculous concept, but like I've said before, to me bitcoin is a hobby, and having a positive impact by getting people to accept it would make me feel good. I don't really mind if I have to spend a little extra. It'd be cool to see my whole neighborhood adopting

Roughly 1% inflation a tear, and you're not a realist or else you'd see that Americans are skeptical as fuck of bitcoin because of the hacks scams and large volatility...you'd also see that large us banks are pretty simple and easy to use if you have their apps a debit card and a credit card. If you believe in the bitcoin principles then bitcoin makes a lot of sense, but if you're an ignorant American who has a nice chase account/credit card rewards, and you have a decent job, and you hear the bad news about bitcoin... Then you're not going to switch.... That's a realist perspective. You're a dollar hating purist with who's trying to predict the future collapse of the American dollar.
@_date: 2014-12-20 03:29:46
its a little creepy, but it makes a great point. The younger audience is probably the best audience for bitcoin. A 13-18 year old kid is the most accepting demographic of new technology, and they're willing to try a different approach to old problems. When you grow up on the internet, you believe that it can solve any problem...even something as set as government controlled money.
I'm sure ill get shelled by buttcoin about pushing a "ponzi scheme" on kids.

I don't understand the attack on me. If having an opinion is in bad taste then fine, that's your opinion, and I can respect that.  heres my further opinion, If money is sent on a social media site with a clever quip like "bottle of champagne"... Then isn't it's intent at least somewhat promotional? Is pantera hoping not to be seen and talked about? id also like to know if you're upset with the people who have a positive opinion. Your point is ridiculous. asking for people to not have an opinion on something that was Tweeted for the public... To "mind their own business" to see is laughable. This is also reddit... Where people come to read others opinions.  
@_date: 2015-05-16 22:28:46

It's so hypocritical, and I don't think  bitcoin should feel threatened. Niche coins can help with blockchain bloat... Nobody is trying to overtake bitcoin, even ripple. The bitcoin network will be too important by the time it goes mainstream.
There's a need for different coins in my opinion. I think side chains are interesting, but I don't think bitcoin can be a "one size fits a all" coin. Block sizes and transaction times are too important to bitcoins success. Why bloat everything, when having another coin can keep things lean?
@_date: 2015-05-19 01:06:26

@_date: 2015-05-19 03:36:02
No that's not my opinion. My opinion is that this was purely a promotional tip, purposed for other people to talk about. "So what?"
My opionion was that it could of been done with more tact, so that it wasn't in bad taste. My opinion was that giving a 60 dollar tip to a company worth 116 million looks rediculous. They can do whatever they want with their money but if they do it publicaly then a person should be able to call them out for looking absurdly stupid. Surely you can understand that tweets can be criticized...

You ever think about making your own subreddit? call it something like BitcoinCharts? I know id subscribe, because I do like to keep up on a daily basis. I think youd see subscribers, because I know users in bitcoinmarkets want somewhere to post their charts too.

Yea, I wrote about a blog post about it. Its pretty cool. If you're logged into coinbase you can hit buy. There is no checkout process (QR code or copying of addresses) its all automated through coinbase. Safe, and really simple. I think features like this is exactly what bitcoin needs to attract the masses. Bitcoin has to be this easy to use.

Its all new territory. People like to point at previous crashes, but the mining difficulty is different, this crash has lasted longer than the others, and Bitcoin has never had this much VC before. 
If someone tells you Bitcoin is perfectly fine, they has no clue...and, if somebody tells you Bitcoin is dead, they have no clue. A network is only valuable if people use it, and right now its too early to tell how much use the Bitcoin network is going to have.

Uhh, probably bad advice as well... He'd have to sign up, and present documents, and there could be a wait...with the price crashing every couple hours any sort of exchange seems like a nightmare. Just tell him to buy a some sort of gift card with bitcoin. Use gyft. It's probably the best way to preserve value. There's also a lot of companies that except bitcoin if he wants to buy something. Otherwise just go western Union if he's looking to hold cash.

The guy had a good reputation too, its not like hes some seedy nobody. When his profile is 100% with 20+ sells to his name... Then I trust him with a 300 dollar transaction. 
  
@_date: 2015-01-11 07:08:33
Yea, im curious about BTCJam. I picked a guy who only wanted 2.5btc... I felt like if you're going to scam would you really do it for only 700 bucks? I probably should of spread it around though. But if they want their site to be legitimate they really shouldn't have half their borrowers be scammers...

yea it could be, but why not set up for a bigger loan if you're looking to scam? theres guys looking for 40 BTC and getting investors on the site... if you wanted to scam, why not repay a couple small reputation loans then go big. The guy i picked repaid a few already, so it didn't make sense that he'd scam on a 2.5btc loan to me...

TL;DR - Are a lot of Alts scams? Yes. Are some coins actually making strides in innovation? Yes, but they get pumped and dumped anyway.If you really want to know which alt isn't a scam, do research on bitcointalk... but it probably doesn't matter much, because quality coins die as easily as scam coins.  
  
A lot of people scream scam, because the Alt market is small and easily manipulated. Coins get pumped and dumped regardless of their intentions. You can pump and dump just about any coin with 50 to 100 BTC, and 20 times + your money.  
  
 Early on there were many straight scam coins. It was easy to create a coin, pre-mine the coin, Pump it and dump it.... After a while, the Alt community caught on, and avoid pre-mined coins for the most part. There are ways around this....hidden premises or fucking with the set amount of coins after initial releases.    
  
 There are Altcoin devs that are pure, and not scam artists, but  Pump and dump groups are really common and known in the alt community. For these groups finding an altruistic dev is actually a great thing. They can seek out a promising coin... Then slowly pump the price, and volume while praising the developer and the coin.   
  
 Innocent investors see the new coin with high volume and a rising price, The Dev checks out, because he's not apart of the scam. So, everyone invests thinking this is the next great coin. The pump group spikes the price then dumps.   
  
 This happens just as often as scam coins. I liked a lot of alts, and still own a few, but I no longer invest, because these pump groups ruin coins and the reputation of alts. Im hoping that the coins I've chosen will last, and come through on their innovations. I don't think the Bitcoin Network can ever be fast enough to service the entire population. If Bitcoin goes mainstream then I really believe that there will be room for others.  
 
@_date: 2015-01-20 09:42:32
honestly, if you're just looking for a hobby... Mine some altcoins, and sell them on an exchange for Bitcoins. You may or may not break even, but you'll have a much better chance of making money than if you tried to mine Bitcoins. Also the process is pretty much the same, so you'll learn what you need to know if you actually did want to start a large farm.
this is a good resource too, Id go over there and pick some brains.
@_date: 2015-01-15 02:39:09
the mining difficulty wont change because the price is low... Bitcoin mining is incredibly competitive, and its only getting worse. Most successful mining operations work on massive hardware specially designed to mine Bitcoins... There are a lot of Altcoins that are easier to mine, and you might be able to make a few bucks and trade them for Bitcoin... 
Youre not going to make a lot of money regardless of what you mine, because your working off a PC, but if you just want to introduce yourself with the process, and make a small amount of Bitcoin... Mine alts and trade them.
@_date: 2015-01-05 05:45:40

The US has been skeptical about Bitcoin, and regulation proposals have been harsh... This is a really good sign that the regulations won't be that bad. Also the 75 million dollar investment from Bankers and the NYSE means that Wall Street is probably going to accept Bitcoin, and that means a lot of new Legitimate money is coming from the US and around the world. 
TL; DR - The US owns shit in the world market.
@_date: 2015-01-17 03:10:19
Thats apart of my issue. I dont even think I was using the site correctly. I hit buy 2 coins, and then I was directed to a conversation with the scammer... If escrow was automatic I would of used it. I would prefer if Local Bitcoins would prompt me on the danger is all im saying... Like, "hey dumbass, people get scammed buying coins like this" is all I want, and maybe a better reputation function... 100% with over 20 buys seemed pretty safe to me.

Yes, seasoned Localbitcoin traders can do this. But lets say im an American, and I have a lot of money on Bitstamp... Lets say 60 grand, Ok, or even 10 grand? and Ive never used localbitcoins before... Now, my account has been frozen for almost a week. Im terrified. Do I want to click "withdraw", and eat a a fee? Or, do I want to buy more coins on a Slovenian exchange thats just been hacked, only to withdraw those coins, and then try to sell them on LocalBitcoins, (which isnt exactly a perfected system. Theyve had scams users)? I mean come on, you think people are going to go through that hassle? 
Also...The price could also drop on any Bad news from Bitstamp r over the next couple days...So I want to take that risk as well?

 I was a young whippersnapper like you at one point, "I dont need a full coin", I said to myself, "Just buy a third, theyre expensive".
So I bought... Theres nothing like that first time man, itll be the greatest day of your life. I had exactly 1/3rd of a Bitcoin, and I was happy... for a while.
You see, after that first buy.... when those Bits confim, and hit your wallet, its a whole new ball game. You dont quite feel the same after that first purchase, your hands get all tingly, you download the cointicker app to constantly check the price. Youre on reddit a little more often looking for "the good news", which is all the news.... You want to know how much money you're making, but it doesnt matter, you fool! 
If the price goes up, you start thinking that you're an idiot for not buying more, you start cheering for the price to go down so that you can get, "discount coins".
you're itchin' for more satoshi, because youre not at that full coin yet... you cut expenses, you create a changetip account, you ask your buddy for a loan. Its anything you can do, pal! just. to. get. a. few. more. bits!
So you save up and buy that fraction, now you got one... A whole Bitcoin, but that aint good enough is it, Jack? Oh No! Now you want double digits... "I cant miss this gravy train", you tell yourself... so you pick up a side job, you're working the McDonalds late shift just to keep that coin count rising, but thats not fast enough! Wall Street just bought into Coinbase, so you open up a few Credit cards, and all the sudden you're at 20 BTC in a circle account you just opened a day ago.
Its down Hill from there, pal... Next thing you know youre a japanese man whore in a BSDM cyber dungeon. Youve got a cam show, "Give me your Bits ands Ill Show You Mine" Youre an absolute laughing stock, but you dont care, the markets going to turn around, just a few more Bits, we just need China to get back in... And then ill be rich.
Look, just save yourself! Get out while you still can, sweet, sweet Look at ME! GO ON LOOK AT WHAT IVE BECOME, IM SOME SORT OF ANIMAL, ARRRGGGHHHHHH!
TL;DR - This shits addictive.

That's exactly my point. I think it's very difficult, and BitStamp obviously isn't a well run exchange. I think I've botched this thread of comments by making my bluntly making comments...let me start over
 I believe that large (already profitable) companies who are involved in selling coins have the best shot at developing the safest exchanges. Bitpay has the coins, they could raise the money easily, and they could safely run an exchange. I see that the risk is high, why not stick with what you're good at? That makes sense... But we've had 3 large exchanges with major hacking issues in one year. Bitpay uses BitStamp, which clearly isn't safe.... At what point does Bitpay say "this is more risky than doing it ourselves?". On top of all that, a Bitpay exchange would be popular just from it's name. I don't think they would have trouble making money. There's a lot of work that needs to be done in keeping hot wallets safe... Until we have a full proof method id rather trust the companies that are leaders in the space.
So come on give me some more down votes.

Well, techically speaking there are many of them, though Though the "Bullwhale" is rarely seen this time of year. They come in "aquatic herds", so if you spot one its more than likely that there are more to follow. Its not uncommon to see more than 100 at any given time. Recently, however, the population has come into question, after not a single sighting occured last year.
 The key to spotting one is waiting, or as enthusiasts like to say "Hodling". The method, is quite delicate. A Bitcoiner will wimper on reddit, begging fo signals of a good time to buy... The Bullwhale, if present, will enter an exchange and drive up the price... The problem in most cases is that the species is often off-put by numerous factors, and If the investing temperature isnt just right... they will often move on to a much less volatile and more profitable investment.
I hope this helps, and happy "hodling"

ok... Traders on an exchange are different from devout believers. There are some that are in it for the long haul. I assume you, are a holder and trader based on your name and argument.
However, there are many people who traded on Bitstamp, the most popular exchange in the world, to make a profit. They have margins, so maybe entering the market at this price, would cost them a large loss. 
There are a lot of other reasons to quickly try to withdraw in fiat, but I feel like you refuse to be convinced that some people just dont want to trade on a hacked site anymore. A lot of people have lost a lot of money on fallen Bitcoin exchanges. Now, I hope Stamp bounces back...but hope and trust are two different things.

oh yes, escrow... which is an option but not mandatory despite everyones claim that its absolutely necessary? Like ive said many times, I know it was completely my fault by not using escrow, but LocalBitcoins can and should improve the experience. Its like a driver not wearing his seatbelt... is it his fault he was injured? yes, But that shouldnt stop the car company from innovating, the car can still be made safer.  If multiple people are scammed everyday on your site, maybe you should change up a few things? A website should be hard to fuck up, especially when Im paying someone 300 dollars. Thats a good rule of thumb for companies that want mainstream adoption. 
As for the conversation with the hacker, yes, very strange... Ive never encountered anything like that before in my life. "What are you going to do about it pussy?" was I think how he confirmed that I had been scammed. I found him so brash for stealing 300 bucks... I couldnt really help but laugh it off. What am I going to do, catch him? threaten him? Hes clearly not the guy from the direct deposit.... It was like looking at a criminal who crossed the boarder. I couldn't really do anything about it.

thats all fair, all good points... But lets say you have a website and your site is great, but it has this one massive problem... and that one massive problem gives your site a bad reputation. Why wouldnt you try to eliminate that problem as much as possible? I may be a dumbass, but its easy to fucking see that LocalBitcoins has an issue with scammers when me and 6 other people get taken for over 4 grand in less than a week by a user who gained a 100% reputation. Half the people in this post say they dont use the site for that reason... I would say that its not a great business model if half your target audience avoids your site completely. Theres a lot of dumbasses out there, and they have to buy their bitcoins somewhere...

its a smart idea... There should be a small transaction site that doesn't take days. If you're just looking to try it, Im in the NYC area. Id sell in small amounts.

Id just use coinable if youre in a country that supports it. Hook it up to your bank account. Screw Paypal. Coinable will turn Bitcoin to Cash for a 1% fee, It takes 2-4 days, but you sell at a set price, so you won't have to worry about volatility.

Yep, totally didn't happen on LocalBitcoins. The scammer didn't create a user name, and lurk there, and I didn't click "buy" on the  price he was offering. No you're right... Zero to do with local bitcoins. 
@_date: 2015-01-06 20:34:47
I get that its working well, but think about it... Why not get greedy and sell your own coins eventually? They could corner the market daily if they actually get to one million merchants. Theres too much money to be made.

Arnt you going to be limited since your just starting to learn how to code? 
This isn't blockchained based, but I really want a site where I can type in a value range, or product, and the tells me whats currently available for merchants that accept Bitcoin. 
Example: I type in 10 - 20 bucks, and it gives me a list of items from various vendors in that price range...  
I don't really want to buy on the site. I just want it to show me whats currently out there, and where I can buy it. It could be a useful starter project for someone learning to code.
@_date: 2015-01-26 02:33:47

@_date: 2015-01-06 04:39:59
I dont see why it would fail... Coinbase has a working business model with both merchant services and a way to buy coins. 
It wouldnt be that hard to integrate an exchange. Bitpay has thousands of merchant wallets. They sell hundreds of coins every single day...Why would incorporating an exchange be such a horrible idea? They could step up and run it properly, and the fees would be low. And the End game is to have no conversion of Bitcoin to fiat, right? Everyone keeps their money in Bitcoin. I think eventually Bitpay will need to find other ways to generate revenue if Bitcoin goes mainstream.
@_date: 2015-01-02 05:10:44
if you both use coinbase then you can send a payment request. Theres no way to speed up the withdraw though... its the 1st so you'll probably have to wait an extra day or 2.
@_date: 2015-01-26 08:10:47
agreed, I never traded Bitcoin, but ill probably start with coinbase.
@_date: 2015-01-02 02:38:23
So my general understanding is this... (could be wrong)
Paycoin was started by GAW. GAW is a company where you can purchase miners or hashlets via a cloud to mine bitcoin. The cloud mining price is an absolute ripoff, and their business model doesn't make sense.
 Paycoin is a pegged coin at 20 bucks that you can spend at any online retailer through a third party (probably paycoin themselves). But its currently worth 7 dollars on most exchanges... Every pegged altcoin I've seen has been pumped and dumped... paycoin is currently going through a dump right now, its all just very suspicious and another scam for bitcoin to deal with.
TL; DR - Paycoin is run by GAW. A bitcoin mining company with an impossible business model. Its just another scam for Bitcoin to deal with. Paycoin is promising a pegged price of 20 dollars even though its trading at 7 dollars.

I think bitcoin creates the ability for vertical business, because of it's versatility and speed. Bitcoin. services can be stacked. It's certainly not easily, but coinbase is operating as an online wallet (bank), merchant service, and a basic exchange. I know a full exchange is very different, but I don't think it's that far fetched to believe a company like BitPay could do it well, make a large amount of money in the process, and control their own safety.

How many times do I have to say its my fault? This is surreal. 
 There are plenty of things they could do better to alert idiots like me...
1. Make escrow mandatory
2. create a better reputation system
3. flag possible scammers for review 
4. Warn users on questionable buys (Like: hey idiot, no one sells coins this cheap. This is likely a scam. You sure you want to do this?)
5. make comments about users more visible 
5. further verification (optional) if a user wants to seem more legitimate
Do you need these? obviously not, you're very responsible and informed, but I'm an idiot... and there are a lot of people, like me, who have been scammed on the site. I don't want paypal, just a system thats a little more protective of its users, because it is suggested so often to new users of Bitcoin. A lot of people who have no idea what they're doing are ushered to local bitcoins, because they don't want to hook up a bank account. Its a nice "fuck you, welcome to Bitcoin" when you get scammed on you're very first time using the site, even if it is your own fault. I don't wish it on anyone, especially new users who just want to Bitcoin out. 
@_date: 2015-01-04 03:35:08
Did the mods remove the last one?
@_date: 2015-01-24 08:38:29
Well Bitcoin is pretty fast. It has great velocity for a currency. Cycling from exchange to a company back to exchange is fairly easy. Sites do run out from time to time though. Ive seen it on coinbase and certain remittance services. The thing is as the number of users grow, so will the price. Unless people continue to buy at higher prices then there wont be a need for a company to hold that many more coins. Theyll sell smaller fractions of a coin, and then buy smaller fractions of a coin.
Maybe if the market goes bananas and the coin is jumping like 100 dollars a day... there may be a rush to buy up a lot of coins from certain companies, but its not a good business model, why do it when you can buy coins at market price, and then sell them for a market price + fee?
As popularity grows there will be days of high volume, but if that happens the price will go up, and people will buy smaller fractions, So no one will run out.

I just got scammed on my first try. Multiple other people just got scammed. Theres people in the comments (even one who used escrow twice) that got scammed. Theres a lot of people getting scammed here, buddy... I might be dumb, but i think you're in a little bit of denial when you say it doesn't hurt there reputation. 
Its like a pimp who owns a whore house saying, "Well theres a lot of girls here with STDs, If you get one, its your fault you didn't wear a condom"
Sure, but id rather go to a cleaner whore house. LibertyX seems like a much safer, and more consistent option...and from what I'm reading the fees are not that bad.

100% would use, as long as you guys have a good selection. You can even be above amazon prices and I would still buy. 
I think this is more of what bitcoin needs, specialized site, and could  be competitive to any others that sell used books. Also no fees compared to amazon, so you'd make the extra buck or two off each book. There'd be real incentive there for large resellers.
@_date: 2015-01-17 02:26:33
Its just so inconsistent, Nobody. Obviously im taking some risks I shouldnt, but but bitcoin shouldn't be a trial by fire. Its supposed to be a better payment system, and right now its too hard for the mainstream in my opinion... 
I mean theres unique qualities, and its got an enormous amount of potential, but right now its almost better to just speculate, and hold... Treat it as a store of value (like gold), and wait a few years for things to get safer and easier. Im still going to go through this, but fuck... this has been a rough first week.
@_date: 2015-01-13 10:33:31
Id wait a day, buddy, we haven't crashed like this in months....
@_date: 2015-01-19 21:57:40
where are your restaurants? Im living off Bitcoin this year, and could use a few new places to eat...
@_date: 2015-01-26 01:46:09
why would it be a different amount of money? Not saying its Bitcoin, just strange that people would be that surprised.

How about this crash, Oliver?
@_date: 2015-01-01 20:42:22
You do realize this is r/bitcoin...One of the most biased subs on reddit. What did you expect? Did you think you were going to recieve a positive response for commenting that the price is going to halve in a year?
@_date: 2015-01-04 08:12:43
More people are selling coins than buying them is the only thing we know for certain.
One theory that people like to believe is that miners are having trouble with electricity costs when the Bitcoin price is below a certain point. Its expensive to run large mining rigs... so they're selling their coins rather than holding them in order to continue to mine. This would put more selling pressure on the market
Another theory is that people are spending bitcoins with merchants who don't hold themselves. They sell immediately for USD... thus putting more coins / selling pressure.
Market manipulation is also a theory. Chinese exchanges have no fees...and are easy to manipulate...A lot of people are saying the current crash is coming from China, so who knows.
Focus more on how/where bitcoin is being implemented world wide, and what apps are being developed. 
TL;DR - The price is fucked for now, and nobody knows why with any certainty...  Hopefully the technology and development will lead to easier use...thats really the only way to Unfuck the price long term.
@_date: 2015-01-03 21:39:05

@_date: 2015-01-20 17:36:44
I think youve got a good 10 years before you see a large amount people living completely off Bitcoin, and you need a lot to go right even for that to happen. There will be a need for exchanging to fiat for most people for a long time.

If they could make a perfectly safe, easy to use  "Bitcoin paypal" that anyone could use. Thats something india / most of the world desperately needs... 
I think the problem lies more with can you get people to trust bitcoin enough for them to actually adopt it as a currency. Is the volatility too much for Indians to use?
@_date: 2015-01-03 05:20:46
GAW is a bitcoin mining company. They offer cloud mining to people who want to buy it...This business model has proven to be unprofitable to those who buy. 
Paycoin was started by GAW. Its an Alt that claims to allow its users to pay for anything online with Paycoin. The coin was heavily premined (by GAW). The coin trades on alt exchanges for $6 USD, but the Paycoin website is offering the coin for $20 USD, but they claim to be "sold out"...So either Paycoin ripped off all those who bought on their website... Or they never sold the coins in the first place, and just put up a fake pegged 20 price to pump and dump the coin on the Alt coin exchanges.
Why is this related to Bitcoin? GAW is a sponsor of the North American Bitcoin Conference in Miami, and Josh Garza the CEO is speaking at the event. Basically hates this, because the guy is a scam artist, and he's making the conference, and Bitcoin look shady.
TL;DR - GAW/Paycoin is sponsoring the Miami Bitcoin Conference, and it looks bad, because they're scams.
@_date: 2015-01-19 20:04:35
thats why I thought they were mining info, but apparently not... maybe  advertised tips? pay to spam you hahahah. Plenty of ways to get creative if you have users.
@_date: 2015-01-07 00:24:36
 A market price is a guess of the true value based on what a large group of investors are willing to pay. The two differ.
A "True Value" is theoretical and can never be achieved, because its constantly changing, and differs from person to person. 
Markets are often wrong in their evaluation of "true value" because of influential factors such as potential, hype, greed.  
@_date: 2015-01-03 07:29:55
you can mine Alts... trade um for bits. Im not sure if its worth it, but you'll have a better shot at that than trying to mine bitcoins.

@_date: 2015-01-18 06:54:15
Why are you so aggressively against changing the site? Are all 6 of those changes that horrible? They wouldn't turn it into paypal, and it would of prevented me and others from getting scammed. Im just giving you honest feedback... Some are those are easy tweaks to the interface. Most things in  Bitcoin could be improved, especially when people are getting scammed.

hahah, the price dropped since I bought. I also get a good amount of overtime most weeks, which didn't happen this paycheck because of the holidays. They also take out another $130 for tax free transit...but yea its not a huge salary by any means. Its usually 14 -1700 take home.

@_date: 2015-01-05 05:27:07
Id like to build off this idea... what about an online arcade with micro transactions in Bitcoin? and if you were to score highly then you earn bitcoins back...if you made the games difficult then you could make a profit easily, and the best players could make money.
This could be great. Is anyone working on something like this? call it "BitArcade".
@_date: 2015-01-14 21:14:04

If bitcoin goes to 1 million then i just tipped you over 3 grand.
@_date: 2015-01-03 05:50:39
Yes, you can pay GAW to cloud mine for bitcoins, and lose money in the process. 
If you don't think its a problem that GAW/Paycoin is a premier sponsor of The Miami Bitcoin Conference then thats a little messed up.. Josh Garza (The CEO) is going to speak, and be recognized. Its fucked man. 
This post covers GAW pretty well, and why their cloud mining operation is an unprofitable scam.
@_date: 2015-05-16 21:40:21
Im using btcjam. 75% ROI in 5 months, its been really profitable so far. Only 1 person hasnt paid their loan. They can do better in a lot of areas, but if youre careful, and spread your money to many loans then its pretty safe.

@_date: 2014-12-08 07:06:37
That's ok, I know that's been going on. but I'm thinking something on a larger scale and with videos, and well known porn stars... Something where you could do a monthly subscription OR pay a small amount to view one single video... There's nothing out there like that... Even regular sites don't offer micro transactions 
@_date: 2014-12-17 01:45:40
Im surprised wikipedia isnt doing more to support bitcoin. They seem cut from a similar cloth...Power and information to the people by the people. If the bitcoin option was showcased like "Credit Card" "PayPal" "Amazon" then id give them the 3 bucks a month that theyre always begging for.
@_date: 2015-01-05 09:00:20
I was going to say... you'll probably have to wait a couple days,  but 1.65? yea, no problem.
@_date: 2015-01-17 10:37:23
Don't you think I'd trash the sight if that were so? I mean I'm taking the complete blame. It's my fault. All I'm asking is that they try to make it a little more difficult on scammers, because this did happen. And other people here are saying the same thing. I can't figure out why people loyal to the site wouldn't prefer extra security. What does it hurt? Everybody is calling me an idiot... Perhaps rightfully so, but I got scammed. And other people got scammed. It's not rare on LocalBitcoins... So should we just call all these people idiots? Or is it possible that localbitcoins might be able to do a little more to prevent this from happening. Escrow is available, but I see a guy with a perfect 100% reputation, and it's not 10 grand. It's 300 bucks. I'm sorry for trusting their rating system.
@_date: 2015-01-26 08:29:26
jesus OP, you must have a lot of coins to be tipping 5 BTC. You an early adopter?
@_date: 2015-01-20 23:16:01
In OPs image its cheaper. Not by much, I was more curious than anything. The "Why the fuck" reads exaggerated looking back at my first comment. Didnt really intend it that way.
@_date: 2015-01-17 07:21:16
The evolution will come. The safer the better for the mainstream. If  someone made a scam-free LocalBitcoins, then me and the rest of the idiots will use that site. Theres a lot more idiots than smartpeople in the world. Most of them want things done for them rather then doing it themselves. They're lazy cattle... Someone is probably developing a simpler safer LocalBitcoins right now, and ill end up using that site, because Im too dumb for LocalBitcoins.
@_date: 2015-01-13 10:29:47
ahhh, finally... So its you Russia. 
@_date: 2015-01-17 02:03:30
fuck that man. This is the best way to buy Bitcoins for cash according to many. LocalBitcoins should be the forefront of mass adoption, because people dont want to hook up bank accounts...  and the site is flat out not safe. I was an Idiot, but this shouldnt be a "learn from your mistakes" experience. It can be a much safer environment without sacraficing too much freedom. Scams should be rare, not the fucking norm. 
@_date: 2015-01-24 06:06:23
circle.com with a creditcard is probably the quickest option with the smallest amount of fees.
@_date: 2015-01-05 09:31:00
Even if thats true, nobody could stop a site from running in a country where gambling is legal. Think of the popularity of a game like DOTA where you could actually make money by wining. Bitcoin makes that possible. 
@_date: 2015-01-28 07:41:58
you can't buy much with bitcoin right now, and the chance is always there that any savings will be worth nothing. 
@_date: 2015-01-10 05:42:36

If you're looking for the easiest way to send bitcoin as fast as possible...Just tell him to make a coinbase account, coinbase to coinbase is instant, and it's a wallet. I know it's not as fun as changetip, but it's instant and it's still money.

@_date: 2015-01-17 05:06:21
so like a marketplace and a wallet and an exchange? theres alt coins doing that, I'm surprised bitcoin isn't trying it too...
@_date: 2015-01-06 23:38:23
right or just look at the stock exchange. what a company trades at can be far different from its true value.

I just want to see remittance working better and cheaper than Western Union and Wire Transfers. If Cypto can gain a foothold in that market then its a giant step in the right direction to total adoption.
I would prefer to see Bitcoin doing a few things really well rather than 1000 things at "meh" level.
@_date: 2015-01-28 21:32:06
Its not like Bitcoin will change this... If it goes mainstream Satoshis wallet could be worth a trillion dollars.
@_date: 2015-01-05 10:11:40
uhhh, he sold Satoshi dice for 11 million?
@_date: 2015-01-26 06:08:23
Thats true, my point is only that its a nice innovation that made buying simple and safe. I wouldn't care which wallet service does it. Coinable is obviously getting powerful quickly here, but their innovations can and should be stolen by others.

@_date: 2015-01-17 02:42:55

@_date: 2015-01-26 03:11:07

I never really argue when asked about these kinds of incidents, they dont understand, and im sure as shit not going to convince them to buy bitcoin after they hear about a hack... I say "not good" and go about my day. 
@_date: 2015-01-03 21:09:21
It is a little irritating, and I'm sure Tim Draper is pissing himself...but its only a 20 dollar drop in a bear market. I don't think bitcoin dies today.

@_date: 2015-05-19 01:42:30
the value is in the transaction, because its peer to peer, and sendable around the world it allows for people to use it in ways money cant be used.

There's a big rush to create two things right now in alts. A lot of coins are trying to create their own decentralized market (AeroMe, Bitbay, SDC, supernet), and also many are trying to create pure anomimity (XMR, Dash) anounomous transactions. There's also a lot specific coins trying to capture the marijuana market (potcoin, cannabiscoin, maryJcoin) because in the US the dispensaries can't have bank accounts. Startcoin is a coin that's being used for crowd funding. It's actually backed by some decent money and names (Russell brand used it), but people are hesitant because it was started by max keiser who started maxcoin which tanked. Finally I just invested in a brand new coin called "Crave". It's operates only in tor, and it allows you to create your own anonymous digital assets. Basically it's trying to be like shopify for darKmaerkets. It's trying to allow anyone to set up a dark market on the tor network. It's brand new so I'm not sure how valid it's claims are, but I thought the idea was incredibly interesting. 
TL; DR - alts are trying to get into spaces that Bitcoin hasn't expanded to yet with startups. That's where most of the innovation is driving to. Honestly the best way to know them all is to trade them. In my experience when you day trade alts your leaning curve is a lot faster because you have a vested interest.

I could point you to the ones im in, but I gotta be honest. Its crap shoot... The  problem is that no altcoin has every broken a long term ATH (all time high) in price. Right now every single Alt is technically a pump and dump. This is largely because almost all were created during the beginning of the bear market (except for litecoin as ive learned today), and theres not  enough new money going into alts... All altcoins have a vested interest in bitcoins success, because that should bring more people into the altcoin market. Now thats not to say big money isnt being made. Coins get pumped and dumped daily... so day trading is a religion right now for alts. You can make a great deal of money fast if you buy and sell correctly.
Its hard to distinguish what will last. Right now its like selecting a sea turtle egg from a nest of 100 others and saying "that one will survive to adulthood". If youre going to get into it long term, get on Bitcointalk and read about them. Every alt has its own thread and thorough explanation. I picked mine based on the dev. I think a coin with a trusted developer who codes well has a decent shot at making it.

im going to get killed for saying it, but use btcjam.com, and spread it across a lot of loans that you believe are trustworthy. Ive more than doubled my coins in 3 months. There are some people who abuse the site and steal loans, but its not common if you invest in trustworthy members.

so far so good. Although I havent actually bought any coins yet... i think its saves up to the point of 4 dollars then makes a purchase. The app was really simple to set up if you already have coinbase set to a bank account. The whole process took me maybe 2 minutes/

TL DR; I bought it, it's great and easy to set up. So far it feels safe...SO FAR
(No shill) I got the app 4 days ago, linked my chase credit card account, and Its already bought bitcoins (.01733 to be exact).
 If you have coinbase and a U.S. bank account the process to sign up is less than 5 minutes. You just log in to both accounts, pick which bank account you want to use for accumulation, and you're all set to start mowing. That made me more comfortable, because my coinbase account is already linked to my bank account. 
I'm not sure if you need a coinbase account linked to a bank account or not.
Lawnmower says it doesn't save any of the bank info. And I guess I trust them for now hahaha. It buys bitcoins after 4 dollars of accumulation, and it's all automated, goes straight to your coinbase account. It's also got a stats section, but it's not functional yet "coming soon". 
I'll give it a week then I'll try to write a blog post about it, haven't written one in a while.

in the beginning when litecoin first got popular... it was the only altcoin you could buy. Naturally people assumed that it would be the silver to bitcoins gold. And it was for a while, it was Litecoin mirrored the bitcoin price. Exchanges picked it up, and many believed that if Bitcoin would gain popularity litecoin would automatically follow. Crypto-currencies are networks, and their value is ultimately derived from how many people are using / will use the networks. Litecoin has slowly lost popularity and will continue to do so.
2 things.... 
* The Bitcoin Crash of 13: Litecoin was created during the bull of 2013, when Gox crashed the price of Bitcoin. Litecoin spiked in price when bitcoin started to crash, because people assumed it was competition, but then litecoin soon followed suit and crashed as well. So all of the sudden you have a coin thats been pumped and dumped, and many are skeptical if it will recover, because its big brother Bitcoin was also being questioned at the time.
*  Other Alts: Right around the same time as litecoin crashed, other alts began to emerge. litecoin is faster than bitcoin, but thats about all it does differently. It also has a lot higher coin count (this is important later). After people saw litecoin rise they came to the realization that any coin could similarly rise. Now this intuition lead to many of scams, and thats why you cant talk about alts on the without being immediately dismissed...  but some of these Alts  are actually legitimate, and are working on inovative features...anonymous transactions,  instant transactions, staking in the network to earn interest on coins, built in decentralized marketplaces, special wallet features, digital assets...ect. Theyre basically acting as crypto-currency startups looking for people to buy into their features.
Litecoin isnt trying to do any of that. Its a slightly faster bitcoin clone. Thats it, so its losing the battle on inovation.  These alts also have a lot lower coin count... so theyre a lot more rare than litecoin. Traders see that the value of a different altcoin can skyrocket on a much lower market cap than litecoin. Theres basically been a gold rush looking for the most innovative coin. All of this while Bitcoin and litecoin stay the same. 
Now Bitcoin gets away with it, because it was first, thousands of startups are trying to make features for bitcoin, which rivals the various alt coins being developed. Litecoin isnt getting those startups anymore to want to build on their network, infact other alts are starting to attract the attention that litecoin once had.... and like I said before if you dont have a popular network you wont have a network or value very long. 
So, no dont do it, Litecoin is losing popularity, and isnt doing anything to win it back. stick with bitcoin or ride the roller coaster of playing the altcoin market with a more innovative coin. 
Edit: it took me a while to write that out, but I get upset when people talk about alts, and they immediately get dismissed around here. Other coins will be used theyre not all scams, and some of them are brilliant (not Litecoin), and it wont ruin the bitcoin network either... the bitcoin network is too big to be rivaled. I wish everyone would embrace the fact that a few other coins with specialty functions are needed to avoid centralized start ups.

There is but its not really trustworthy, especially since so many borrowers are looking to "refinance" like theyll borrow, then refinance to pay off the first loan, effectively giving them a better rating then theyll borrow some more, and run. 
I mean even if you go for their "A rated" loans from guys with perfect histories youre going to get hit with a scam at one time or another. Im not trying to be xenophobic but all my but one of my scam loans came from non US or western Europe borrowers, so that has influenced who I now loan to. 
Certainly, I could of been more carful, and patient. You can add friends to those youve previously loaned to, and the site will let you know when they request a new loan, but that wasnt why i joined  Jam. I wanted to test the system. 
I put 1 btc last january without any expectations, and i just tried to find sucessful loans without being completely paranoid. Its been up and down with the price fluctuations and scams. 
If all my loans would of been paid off I would of close to tripled my money, but that didnt happen, im around 1.2 btc. I havent invested for a while, because of the lack of loans currently fundable, but im still interested in sites like these, because of their potential.

its easy to dismiss tor and dark markets. I get it, theyre illegal and are ultimately risky. Bitcoin is trying to move further and further away from that atmosphere for good reason... But tor and dark markets arent just going to disappear.

Your example yielded that answer. If im assigned to do a task and I can get it done for less money then Ive done a better job than whoever hired me to do it. I'm not saying "be lazy" I'm saying maximize potential. If I can work on something else of more importance than why is it such a bad thing to hand off a simple task?
A fast food CEO doesn't fry French fries. He hires someone to do it, because he has something better to do.
Also why is that example inane? Outsourcing is a perfect example of everything I'm talking about.  Those companies don't think about laziness, they think about the maximization of potential.

@_date: 2015-11-25 21:48:33
I don't think reason is yours. I'm going to explain this as simple as possible so even you can understand it.
If I get hired to do a task, and it's within my salary to get someone else to do it so I can focus on something more important. And the job I was originally assigned to do is done well  for that company then it's a good idea to do so not only for me but for the company as well. This is what that fast food CEO in my example is doing... His job is  to sell more fast food. There are many ways he can do this, but hiring people to do tasks within the company is the most efficient, and will create the most profit.

When did i say that they were exclusive? My point the whole time has been that hard work alone doesn't necessarily equate to a good employee. Obviously it can. Paper writing is pretty useless, especially for core courses unrelated to your major... Unless you want to be a journalist... paper writing is barely ever needed in most employment. So why not get someone to write a paper for you, so you can focus on something more important, maybe related to your future job? I wrote a 10 paper on the napoleonic era in france for a european history class... I worked my ass off, and i think i got a B-. Its served zero purpose in my current employment. I could of been using photoshop or after effects in that time. Explain to me why I shouldn't have someone write that for me if I'm going to spend the time on something more useful...

The point of "getting an education" has changed for a lot of people. For many "getting an education" is only a requirement to find a good job, so you can pay for that education. I think the internet has changed what it means to be "educated". Ive learned more on the internet than I did in my 4 years of over priced college. Its opportunistic to have someone do the work for you, and if your time is better spent on something else then I see no wrong in having someone else do the work... If anything that shows a mindset of someone who sees the triviality of most college courses required for a degree.

But I had to go through a lot of bullshit for the college degree. All just to put it on a resume. 
Edit: it's that way for most degrees to be honest. Most of your skills and knowledge are learned during employment. That's why most jobs require x years of experience.

look were going to disagree. I think a hard working, well deserved diploma is an archaic way of analyzing potential employees. I couldn't give a fuck, because working hard  doesn't equate to efficiency or effectiveness in modern employment. I know a lot of people who work their asses off, but have zero ability to do effectively make money for their companies. They hold a job, and never advance. Its about thinking smart... Getting someone who's better at writing papers than you, to do your work for you, so you can focus on other more important tasks is working smart to me. Have a solid day.

First of all your original question was really vague... All of this depends on the company, job, and task at hand, so for you and I to argue about a hypothetical "job" is rediculous. There are plenty of jobs that give you the freedom to hire if needed, they're are plenty of jobs where yes you do need to do the assigned task. 
Second of all, no, your professor is nothing like a boss.  
Third of all not everyone needs to "learn how to learn". Highschool taught me how to do that...because I had to get good grades to apply for college. 
Forth, colleges have an absurd amount of degrees that don't even prepare you properly for the work the degree is assigned to do. They're over priced bullshit, case in point being athletics where they allow under qualified students into a university and pass them despite performance so the students can make the school more money. (Side question) Does that bother you, and discredit every single university that makes money off sports? Doesn't that indicate that they are scams in their own right?
  And finally. Because of the above hypocrisy...I don't give a fuck if the kid went to college or not if I'm an employer. It comes down to the bottom line of can he make the company more money. 
People have so much respect for a degree that comes from institutions that have been fucking people over since their inception. I'm sorry if I don't care for them and their hypocritical  "honorability". I work hard at my job. I don't think I'm entitled for questioning universities, fuck those who are fucking you.

im in on it. haven't received a late payment yet although i invested in a C+ loan only to find the borrower had an E + rating... They need to change it so that the borrowers rating factors in more to the loan. It looks like ill probably loose .04 on that loan

Im not disagreeing with you, but that is the answer to OPs question... prices haven't doubled, because the country isn't in a recession. When you print that much money it does stimulate the workforce. You can't argue that the economy is looking a lot better, and that the US dollar is stronger. I don't think it will last, but thats why prices haven't doubled.

Crave. Its brand new... Best Alt I've ever seen, and Ive followed them closely since last year. It operates off tor, and it has some amazing features.

Kids actually are buying drugs with bitcoin. I wrote a post about a semi legit bitcoin ATM I went to (he only had people purchase bitcoin, and had never had a single costumer try to sell it back), he said the primary demographic was underaged kids, People shot me down saying that they could need bitcoin for a lot of different reasons, but I think its naive to think they're paying a 10% fee just to shop on amazon.

Just read the general feeling... if you see unnatural volume its generally a sign that the price is shifting... Like on this last crash to 160 the volume was insane. same with the spike at 315. I'm always on bitcoinwisdom.com during those times, because you'll see the volume. It'll be too bizarre of a spike or crash to be natural. people are manipulating with bots to entice panic buys or sells.
Also understand that even in a bull market you'll still see the price rise and fall on its way up.... You'll almost always have more than one opportunity to buy at a certain price. so if the price is at a high, give it a couple hours or a day,  you'll usually get a better price. 
@_date: 2015-02-12 11:04:56

the answer is...a lot. Any thing that looks sketchy on that site probably is. I got scammed a few moths back on my very first trade there, and every regular user blamed me for being stupid about the trade...So it seems like most users dont even give a fuck that the scammers are around which seemed to me to be pretty brutal, but I guess ts trade at your own risk... There are plenty of sites that provide a good buying service, Ive never been back to local bitcoins, and ive never had a problem buying from coinbase.

I don't think you would... It's completely viable because migrant minimum wage workers would take any job at any price. Even if it's in bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-02-20 10:59:37
I dot think they would. A lot of minimum wage workers don't have bank accounts... And a lot of their income is immediately spent on living expenses. 500 - 600 dollars on a two week paycheck isn't leaving you much to save every month. Most spend the majority of their money immediately on groceries and  other needs.

On the surface this idea may sound stupid, but stick with me...
I want to be able to offer up a bounty to people to take an original picture or video of a location.... Now, I know, thats nothing special, but in times of a crisis or an event.... I would pay money for some original I phone photographs or videos. Its basically an experiment in bounty amateur journalism and photography...
An example 
10 bucks in Bitcoin for any shots of the ISIS raqqa event 
I wanted to know how legitimate that event was, were there thousands of people cheering at the video? or was it just 10 ISIS guys... Theres no decent pictures of the event. 
Also users have the ability to make the bounty request public or private, share the pictures to the site or keep it to themselves...
EDIT: If it got popular it could help a lot of people in bad situations by giving them money, and it would help spread Bitcoin across the world.
I also forgot, if a bounty is public then other users can add to it... like instant crowd funding.
Ive got some other ideas to shape the site in terms of usability, but ill wait for you to comment.
@_date: 2015-02-12 02:09:43

Unless you can run like 5 grand worth of free electricity a month then I don't know if its worth it. Even at 5 grand you'd only make a few coins a month. I don't know if it'd even cover the cost of the miners. Theres a lot more to it than just the electric. 
Maybe mine Darkcoin? I know people around here don't like to talk alts, but you'd probably be more successful.

well that makes 2 of us... Its a tough pill to swallow, but people around here should take notice.

I also think theres plenty of room for other coins, its not like bitcoin is going to disappear.

what do you want for it? id like to buy it.
@_date: 2015-02-12 00:53:06
I agree with you on the cost of armored cars, and security, rent and labor, but they do have to wait to pay... They have to hold large sums of money for a long periods of time regardless of operational cost. Now maybe that cost can be undercut using Bitcoin, but you need a few use cases to display that. Youre also forgetting that a bitcoin company must take the drug cash in exchange for coins... Can a company do that without getting into serious trouble? 
I dont know, and thats my point. Theres a lot of unknown to navigate for merchants to even try to make the switch. Im not saying youre wrong. Im just saying bitcoin has to undercut the security costs by a good margin, and the transition from drug cash to bitcoin has to be seamless and consistent for weed merchants to want to make the switch.
Its more than just Bitcoin will save you money.... It cant be too much of a hassle logistically. 
@_date: 2015-02-24 06:17:10
its also a first time only offer

so how big do you want to increase it then? is 25mb going to do it? 50mb? and then when you get to that size you think you can avoid all the problems that come with a larger block? Theres going to be bloat regardless. you don't think theres going to be a need for faster transactions?

thats a subjective viewpoint of a bitcoiner. I agree with you, but when a weed merchant, who isn't as devout as you, looks at the chart.... It doesn't exactly strike them as a good place to unload 100% of their businesses gross income.

For large amounts transferrer is great, but type in 10 dollars to that site, Its a $3.00 fee.

if you're an actual store and not an online merchant...Look into selling bitcoin using the service LibertyX. theres no fees for you and I think they're currently offering no fees to buy bitcoins for promotion. They have thousands of merchants who sell bitcoins for them...  Then promote discounts for using bitcoins. Its a way to grow bitcoin, and you as a bitcoin merchant. 
If you can't get bitcoiners to buy from your store then try to sell bitcoins to your current costumers and offer them cheaper products for doing so. 
@_date: 2015-02-17 16:49:13
you should post to the LOL subreddit and changetip them to try it out.
@_date: 2015-02-12 11:11:33
yea, but your customer isn't going to pay in bitcoins... That was my other point, so you need these merchants who are technically drug dealers to buy their bitcoins in cash. I guess install some 1% BTMs in your store, and convince your customers to change their cash before they buy?
@_date: 2015-02-10 20:29:21
Try testing it out on me... A guy had a similar problem, and when he tipped me 10 bucks it started working for him.

Im all for him. Why you ask? the more comfortable people are with digital currencies the easier it will be for them to see the advantages of Bitcoin. The MPesa still has a lot of fees. None of these services Gates supports will be as cheap as Bitcoin. A stable Bitcoin beats all the centralized competitors.

because the company is profiting off every transaction made with that card. But everyone earning minimum wage or below is being exploited in someway or another . Check Cashing, and Loan Sharks, Money gram... And what about sweatshops world wide where people are living on company property? or the migrant farmers in the US being paid below minimum wage illegally? 
Yes its a slightly different way to take the poors money, but bitcoin or not...it would still go on, you can't just stop the exploration of those who are less fortunate.
