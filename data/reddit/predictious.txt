Predictious doesn't use randomness, therefore it is provably fair.

We manually review every failed withdrawal. Did you contact us on the [customer support page]( so we can take care of this?

Hi Benjamin, we have replied to you on May 15th.

The same could apply to satoshidice, other lottery sites, poker sites, and casino sites using Bitcoin, as online gambling is also incredibly illegal in the US. That doesn't stop people in the US from using them.
Binary option trading platforms are regulated in the US, but not illegal, since websites like Nadex do exactly that from the United States, and have a license from the CFTC to do so.
But in any case, we operate from Ireland, where this is perfectly legal.

Actually, Google doesn't have any information about what you are doing, nor do they have a way to trace it back.
But thanks for the suggestion, we'll think about adding an alternate method of authentication.

1. You don't need one more login, you can use your existing google account.
2. Predictious is much more advanced than bitbet, you can set the odds you want (like on betfair) and you can re-sell your shares before the event ends (to make early profits). We also offer tools to manage your account (transaction history, current open orders, etc.)
3. It is much more secure than bibet

In this particular case, we may extend the deadline. The goal was to avoid to give an unfair advantage to some people, as not everybody can watch the show live.

We are based in Ireland, where this is legal. Also trades denominated in virtual currencies (BTC to BTC) don't fall under the jurisdiction of the regulators, like [this comment]( from Jon Matonis (executive director of the Bitcoin foundation) suggests. They already have enough problems regulating BTC/USD trades.

Why IEM? You know you can do that with Bitcoin on [Predictious](
