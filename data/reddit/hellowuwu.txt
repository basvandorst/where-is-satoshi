It’s bad because the general public isn’t ready for a new financial system yet. You’re talking about such a radical change and concept that most people don’t have an understanding of and can’t grasp. 
A company like Stripe is making the effort to normalize blockchain technology for mass adoption by creating familiarity. 
It’s ok to be passionate about a new financial system that is outside of traditional systems. But if you’re not considering what that means for the average user and thinking about adoption for the masses, then you’re only fooling yourself. 
If you build it, they will come - is the biggest lie in the software industry (coming from someone who works in the software industry.)

Then those people are morons. The one thing everyone knows about investing is that it's gambling. Make smart decisions but know that you have a chance of losing your money. That's why you don't invest every penny you have.

So I'm one of the few that subscribed to this subreddit due to the news. I'm going to start reading through all the Info links on the right but I had some immediate questions. What drives the worth of a bitcoin up and down? Usage? Demand? Is it somewhat like stocks? How do I get started? If someone gifts me bitcoin using the bitcointip bot where do I go to see where this currency "lives"? Can someone throw a bone here so I can see what it looks like? (Unless I can gift myself?)

Thanks! How often does that value change?
What is "+0.50"? Are there other "commands"?
Definitely gonna do some more research - I'm just a bit confused whether a bitcoin lives in the cloud (in an account) or as a file. Sorry if I'm asking too many questions. I find this fascinating.
