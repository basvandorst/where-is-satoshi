Do you have any feel for how long it might take to process say 5000 withdrawal requests for BTC?
@_date: 2016-08-09 09:09:36
All my USD was in my exchange wallet, and all still shows there on the BitFinex site.

Since everyone was forced to reset their 2-factor authentication just two or three days ago, anyone without both an IP address lock (such as anyone with a dynamic IP address) and withdrawal address locks, has just lost greenline status and can't get it back for a few more days.
Can you make an adjustment to the 5-day 2FA requirement so the forced 2FA reset doesn't push almost everyone into delayed manual withdrawals?

I'm another US verified customer in the same boat, but with a different excuse. In my case, they're blaming the freeze on SynapsePay instead of BitGo:
"Notice: At this time withdrawals are temporarily disabled for your account while we finalize your accounting and balances. The reason for this delay is due to complications with your USD balances associated with our US banking partners. ..."
Although Synapse did wire me ~75% of my USD (missing the last credit just before the hack), I have enough BTC stuck in BitFinex to cover the difference, so there's nothing stopping BitFinex from adjusting the BTC to compensate and letting me withdraw/trade the rest. Also, I didn't request Synapse to do anything, and would be willing to sell some of the BTC myself if BitFinex really needs more USD from me to take the 36% haircut.
Here's my exchange with Zane:




EDIT 8/13/2016: My account is no longer frozen.

Aren't you overlooking the 36% of non-stolen BTC balances that has been taken and distributed to the other accounts?
While I agree with you that there very well could be less BTC in their wallets than post-haircut BTC balances, I think the discrepancy is much less than 76k.
Let's say we assume that the total of BTC balances pre-hack was 119,756 + 125,424 = **245,180 BTC**. Then BTC balances post-haircut should total to 245,180 x 0.63933 = **156,751 BTC**. And if they only held 125,424 BTC in their wallets when withdrawals opened, then they are short 156,751 - 125,424 = **31,327 BTC**, not 76,563 BTC.
But it is a wild assumption that BTC balances pre-hack was 245,180 BTC. The 125,424 BTC they held post-hack could include company reserves or BTC bought elsewhere to compensate for the shortage.

When can we expect that to be resolved? Hours? Days? Weeks?

If the person who will enable trading isn't working 24 hours every day, can you give us a window of time during which it won't happen, while he is sleeping?
@_date: 2016-08-09 12:21:29
Will you give us at least an 8 hour heads up before enabling withdrawals/trading?
Or will you implement the idea to choose a few specific times of day at which they might be enabled, committing to not do so between?

How can I become green-laned?

My account is no longer frozen! Support just emailed me a couple hours ago:


I was able to successfully buy BTC with my remaining USD balance (it had increased in the last 16 hours before the exchange shutdown), which did not receive a haircut, and withdraw that BTC as well as my previous BTC (which did get a 36% haircut). The BTC transactions (I split it up into multiple between 1 and 2 BTC) reached the blockchain within a couple minutes!
@_date: 2016-08-12 12:27:14
I also submitted a support ticket and got a reply a little more than 1 day later:

Same here: 36.067% of my BTC was exchanged to BFX at 604.06 BTC/BFX and all of my USD is untouched. Are you a verified US customer as well?
@_date: 2016-08-10 11:09:22
I currently have no withdrawal address locks. If I enable address locks, will my withdrawals be blocked for 5 days? Or would the 5 day block only happen if I previously had different addresses locked?
@_date: 2016-08-13 22:01:33
I'm one with the Synapse issue. I ~~am~~was unable to buy/sell/withdraw *anything*.
EDIT 8/13/2016: Just a couple hours ago, I got an email from support. My account is no longer frozen! :)

How long might it take to process crypto withdrawals for non-green-laned users?
@_date: 2016-08-13 22:49:34
Only Synapse. Synapse had wired me my 16-hour old balance, so BitFinex froze my account until now.
@_date: 2016-08-08 22:48:28
I am also a verified US user of BitFinex. My USD balance on the BitFinex site did not get any haircut; only my BTC balance lost ~36%. I also received the email in the OP on Aug 3 about the account freeze. And today I received the following email:






I tried to login to the SynapsePay dashboard but I don't have a password for it. I have sent them a support ticket and left a voicemail at the phone number in the email, and will update with what comes of that.
The wording isn't entirely clear as to whether that amount is being wired to my bank account. SirJjjon, did the email you received use the same wording?
Also, the amount is NOT my entire balance. It is about 25% short. It is very close to ($0.05 more) my USD balance before my last exchange trade at 08-02-16 03:41 UTC
@_date: 2016-08-09 22:04:01
Will we be able to cancel withdrawal requests if they take too long to process?
@_date: 2016-08-13 13:31:41
US verified. All my remaining BitFinex balances are frozen. I can't buy/sell or withdraw anything. They're using SynapsePay as their excuse, but I don't see why they can't quickly (it's been days since everyone else got to resume trading) do one of two things:
1) Reduce our BitFinex balances by the amount Synapse sent us (as of the last settlement 16 hours before the exchange shutdown), even if that makes our USD balances negative. Then allow us to trade but not withdraw until we bring the  USD balance out of the red. They're already manually approving all withdrawals, so it shouldn't be hard to check for negative balances
2) Just take from our BTC or other coin balances whatever is necessary to achieve the haircut. This wouldn't be sufficient for customers with only USD, but would enable at least some of us to resume trading.

Not quite. According to bitcoincharts.com's raw data, Bitstamp's all time high was $1163 at 2013-11-30 03:36 UTC:
It's recent peak is $1057 so far, so just $106 to go.
For reference, MtGox peaked at $1242 the day before at 2013-11-29 05:43 UTC.
Coincidentally, $1242 today would put bitcoin's market cap right about $20B.

Yes, just download and install. Well, and check the GPG signature before installing of course.
You should already and always maintain an offline backup of your wallet, just to protect against hardware failure and malware. But as long as nothing glitches, you don't need to do anything special.
