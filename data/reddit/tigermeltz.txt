But if I say "better" your expectations change. Our processes will surely be better and smoother

Literally all 3 for 3 separate reasons.

Now all we need is a Tax Accountant's perspective. Are we declaring bitcoin losses against other capital gains?

Lets not start witch hunts. Just submit your case to the mods.

The former. R/bitcoin currently gives the impression that bitcoins are a pyramid scheme. I myself do not believe it is. However, my arguments look very weak when this subreddit is on fire. I hear comparisons of tulip mania constantly.

Serious as a heart attack.

makes bitcoin seem like a pyramid scheme more than it really is. Everyone freaking the fuck out like babies. Oh no the price dropped. Get the fuck over it. Never invest more than you are willing to lose and bitcoin, if used as an investment tool, should be a diversification tool not an end-all-be-all get rich event.
I used to send people who knew nothing about bitcoin to this subreddit. Now I send them to the wiki. This place can be saved, increased mod presence is one of them.

I wish people would stop buying bitcoin for short term gain THEN PANICKING THE FUCK OUT when the price drops. Hold on to it guys. Bitcoins are a medium of exchange. When bitcoins are used more and more in the market there will need to be more mediums. Bitcoins will be worth more in the future, but we're talking long time.

And time to put that holiday bonus to work. Cheap bitcoins again!!!

I wouldnt mind cheap bitcoins again. Been using the coins since 2010. Not my first rodeo, although it seems to many people jumped the bull.
