Your better off buying with credit.  The price of Bitcoin will rise so fast you will end up paying more in the long run to get to a full coin than you will in interest.   
Also, if you are going to buy, don't panic when you see a $1000 drop.  It happens all the time and always goes higher after the dip.  Just buy it and forget about it.
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:47:40
I don’t think so either.  We’re any major technologies (the underlying technology) a bubble?  Cars, the internet, ....no.

It happens.  Just this past week I sold 200,000 of a coin at a loss that was less  than a cent and now it’s rocketing up like crazy.  Probably going to $1 or more.
All you can do is keep trucking.  Take some risks.  Invest in some alts.  Put in a $100 Bitconnect loan so your risk is minimal.  Buy some Bitcoin now.  This thing is going to a million eventually so there is still room to get back in.
The way I see it, there is no amount of money I would trade my kids for. There is a reason for everything.  You never know,  If your kids are happy/healthy then consider that a win.  If you would have kept the Bitcoin, your circumstances could have been different and not necessarily for the better.  There is a force guiding us through life.

Your all going to curse me out of this sub and I know it's a risk but this is what I do to obtain more Bitcoin.  I loan out on Bitconnect and get around $30-$50 a day in interest.  I immediately convert that interest to Bitcoin which also grows.  It allows me to take advantage of compounding plus the spike in Bitcoin price.  
So far it's working for me.  It's a risk but my Bitcoin wallet is growing every day.

They also need to give an explanation for why we have not received our forked coins.
@_date: 2017-12-19 01:36:36
Nobody is directly answering your question so here it is plain and simple.
Bitcoin Cash forked off of Bitcoin.  They have a self  appointed leader, Roger Ver, who feels Bitcoin Cash should be considered the original Bitcoin.  R/BTC is a Reddit for Bitcoin Cash, although they just leave it as Bitcoin.  Very confusing to newcomers..
Bitcoin Cash supporters feel Bitcoin is too slow so they have a larger blocksize.  Bitcoin supporters, or most of them, feel that increasing block size is not the answer, that’s it’s a temporary band-aid, and want to work on a longer term solution (lightning network, etc.)
I will not trash another coin but my opinion is Bitcoin, not Bitcoin Cash, is the right way to go.  Right now nobody uses it for retail transactions anyway so I’d rather see a longer term solution.  Plus I personally don’t like the arrogance of Ver and some of the trickery going on with BCH.  My thoughts are that if they are proud of their coin, they should just call it Bitcoin Cash and work on beating out Bitcoin like any other alt.  But, make your own decision.  Truth is, I don’t know jack shit about what coins will win out in the end, only opinions.
@_date: 2017-12-02 13:02:24
Hahahah ok.  I really don't care what you think.  Your entitled to your opinion though.  I'll just keep looking at my Bitcoin wallet continue to grow and smile.
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:34:10
I don’t think this is exciting.  There are dips but a close to $5000 dip is very crash like.  Tomorrow we are either going up like a rocket ship or we are crashing down.  Now I don’t think that these banks plan to buy any Bitcoin or am I wrong?  If they are not going to buy Bitcoin why would things rocket up?
@_date: 2017-12-17 15:24:06
Hahahha first of all, I’m very educated.  I have a masters degree and graduated with honors.  I am very successful in my field.

Furthermore, I just made $50,000 this weekend on an alt coin, not to mention the money I have already made on Bitcoin, so let’s not get into education, wealth and success because you’ll get slaughtered.  I wasn’t even going to go this route but you’re the one talking

I think Litecoin is pumping for a few reasons.  It’s the cheapest Crypto on Coinbase so it’s easy for new users to buy and enticing because it’s cheap.  
The fees are lower when sending to certain exchanges.  Problem is when Lightning Network is activated, it will drop significantly.  It might go high in the meantime but I wouldn’t make it a longtime hold.
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:13:54
R/BTC was created by Bitcoin cash people and it often fools newcomers.  I’m not going to talk bad about any coins but if they believed in their coin they should call the sub Bitcoin Cash.  
@_date: 2017-12-13 02:38:56
Sometimes the cost of the coin matters.  For instance, I sunk $3000 into Einsteinium a little while back and made a little over $30,000.  If I would have put the same amount in Bitcoin at the same time, I would have made profit, but no-where near what I made.
So yes, coin price, choice and timing does matter.  So does market cap and supply.  If you invest in a coin with high supply, over a billion, for the most part, you probably never going to reach your price target in the time you want.  Iota is an exception to that general rule.  If you invest in a coin with a lower supply, the easier it is for it to reach your price point.  Sometimes you can even get lucky and a group will pump the coin because they can manipulate the price due to the low supply and cap.

Yes.  I highly doubtful you would ever catch a full coin.  The price could be $15000 in two weeks.  I would just go for it.  Even if you buy it today and it drops down to $10,000 tomorrow, it will still be at least $13,000 in two weeks.

And no, you don’t need to be working on a coin to understand the concepts around it.  And why will it reach a million?  Because (I’m my opinion) it’s going to replace gold.  Also because people are going to be using it as a safe haven for off shore money.

@_date: 2017-12-01 05:52:25
I honestly think some of them haven’t got in because they can’t figure it out.  I’m a smart guy, masters degree, 4.0 gpa throughout college,  When I first got in I had to watch YouTube videos for two weeks to figure out how to do this and I still don’t understand what the hell i’m doing.  I have a frigin ledger  wallet sitting In my drawer collecting dust because it scares the shit out of me to transfer my Bitcoin there.
I think a lot of people want in but are scared or just can’t figure it out.  A lot of people who are tech savvy take for granted how hard this is to figure out for and old timer.  I’m 36.  Imagine grandpa Joe with his bank account full of cash trying to set up a frigin crypto wallet
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:05:45
It's generic Bitcoin though.  I don't get it, especially when Litecoin is better than. Bcash.  Bitcoin is the value store and Litecoin is the transaction coin.  This Bcash thing is a joke.

Alot of noob questions about how Bitcoin is created.  This is the process.
Bitcoin mining process:. You drink a bottle of Mountain Dew and then you stick a finger in your rear end three times.  After that you insert ledger nano s between your ass cheeks.  You tweek a virgin's nipples to finish of the process.  After all those steps are done, a Bitcoin will be in your Ledger.  It's called proof of work.
The Bcash mining process:  Step.one is you take acid.  Then you go to Vers house and watch the movie Brokeback mountain (the entire movie) three times.  After the movie, he will insert the Ledger nano S in your ass.  You cry in his arms and kiss his feet.  The last step is very difficult,  you must find Armstrong and use his giant shiny coconut head to reflect the sun and cause a brush fire.  You remove the nano s from your ass, insert it into the fire.  
I think that's how it works.
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:36:07
I like IOTA and the only reason I didn’t get in is because of the 2 Billion supply number but after reading about the technology it could be something to watch in the future.  To my understanding IOTA technology has a technology flaw with the payment system and I think it is where someone can recall the coin after payment (maybe it was something else). I’m sure they are working on fixing it.  I thought bout buying a few just in case it takes off further.
I would stay away from Ripple completely.  Too much supply, many Billions of coins, and there is no intention to use it as acurrency and there are no other reasons to hold it.

And here’s the drop
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:23:01
I think that when Lightning Network arrives, many of the altcoins with only a payment purpose will be gone.  
The utility coins will be around a little bit longer but they will also go, and we will use Bitcoin to pay for those services.  In the end, Bitcoin and coins with dividends will remain.  That’s why I’m still buying up Bitcoin and investing in alts like COSS and TenX.
The one concern I have about Bitcoin in the very long term is lost coins.  People lose coins all the time by sending to the wrong type of wallet, losing them.  Over time and with mass adoption, this will happen even more. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:57:57
Why do you think people hold gold, so they can trade it for coffee.  It doesn’t matter if it becomes an everyday currency.  Just replacing gold makes it a crazy investment.  Then, if all these companies with off-shore $ want to bring it into the us they can convert it to Bitcoin, hold for a year, and only pay capital gains.  If that happens, we are hitting a million a coin.
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:40:52
You can put it into Coinbase Vault feature.  It will take you 2-3 days to get it out.  They store it offline, that’s why it takes so long.  And the good thing is, since it’s offline, if they get hacked, your Bitcoin is safe.
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:04:06

I have held through some recent scary times.  The China Ban, the BCash attempted takeover.  I have to be honest this past week has been the hardest for me.  There is something going on with the price that I don’t trust.  It keeps hovering between 17000and the mid 16000s almost as if someone is controlling a mini price loop making profits.  In the meantime the alts are skyrocketing taking away our Bitcoin momentum.  
For me, this is the scariest and most concerning time yet.  I feel like the Bitcoin momentum is lost and alts are picking up steam.  At $17,000 most people are going to feel like they missed the boat and go to alts.  And big money is not interested in investing long term in Bitcoin.  They want to toy with it and make profits.
I have never been so tempted to sell and get out as I am now.  I have Bitcoin induced anxiety and I can’t stop checking the price.  It’s really an obsession.  Can someone please talk me out of it before I sell.  Is this going higher or are we done?  Am I wrong for being concerned?
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:06:28

COSS is my favorite.  It’s an exchange that also plans on doing other things.  50% of the COSS exchange profits go to COSS coin holders.  And just as a coin it’s great.  It’s right around 10 cents right now and there is only ever going to be 200 million.  I can see this thing taking off and reaching $2 over the next year.  So if you combine the dividends with the potential price increase, it’s a good investment.
TenX is a payment system for Cryptos and you also get paid a percentage for owning coins.  It’s like getting in early on Visa or MasterCard for FIAT.  There is also a small coin cap number at a little over 100 million so a ton of room for growth.

@_date: 2017-12-17 16:03:28
That’s not a Ponzi.  What you are describing is supply a demand and with Bitcoin you hold your funds.   Bitcoin is anti-ponzi.
A ponzi is when you give someone your money to invest and they use the money of future investors to provide gains to you and the cycle continues. So just like you accused  me of not knowing about Bitcoin you throw facts out there without knowing about the schemes your taking about.

The dotcom bubble was internet companies, not the internet, you understand that right.  There have been coins coming out for years already and succeeding or failing.  We just had a mega failed ICO with Tezos.  Bitcoin is getting old.  If it was a bubble, it's burst already and Bitcoin is at the top.  Now we are just in growth mode.  The big boys are in place, Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dash.  Game over.

Yes,  there are human factors such a rallies with good news an panic selling etc that mimic stock markets.
There is still a lot of money sitting on the sidelines waiting to get in.  Big banks and people like me.

No, your over simplifyig everything.  I'm always skeptical of people that claim they know everything.  The smartest man in history once said "I'm smart enough to know that I know nothing". 
I'll continue to invest.  If this is a bubble, it still has a long way to go.  Even Jamie Dimon, the ultimate skeptic, can see it reaching $100,000.  
I claim it's not a bubble because it's not like anything we have ever seen.  Technology is not a bubble and doesn't apply.  Was the invention of the computer a bubble?  Was the creation of internet a bubble?  So how is the creation of crypto any different.
And I beg to differ about un-educated people invested in crypto.  If your smart enough to get in early to this game, your smarter than the majority of people III m the world right now.  I would put my education up against any person on Reddit and I'm heavily invested.

BCash is a temporary fix.  Larger block size is not the answer.  Better Bitcoin infrastructure is the answer.  
@_date: 2017-12-17 15:30:54
And yet again you fail to realize that Bitcoin doesn’t need to be a payment network to reach a million.  It is perfectly fine as a store of value.  It will overtake gold and reach a million in a few years.
And no, you don’t need to know everything about a coin to make money.  Like I said, I made $50,000 on coin and I don’t know shit about it.  It’s all about supply and demand.  What’s that, your working on Wraith protocol?  Well I could give a shit less but that sounds wonderful for the price.

No, we are holding until there is a great infrastructure for spending.  Bitcoin is working on the long term solution while Bcash is working on the band aid approach.

Bitcoins biggest upcoming competitor is Raiblocks. Each wallet has its own blockchain.  I own Bitcoin but it's not a payment system, it's a store of wealth and there is too much toying with the markets, too.much power in the hands of miners.  I'm starting to lose my faith in Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:52:48

Well we started the year around $1000 and ended up around $11000 possibly $12, $13.  If we continue the same growth, we will be over $100,000.  $100,000 is the conservative estimate.  We did this all without institutional investors.  Now we have both individual and institutional investments over the next year.  I can honestly see $200,000 easily.

It's nothing sceintific but more of feeling and comon sense.  Crypto is less than 1% of the world economy.  If it reaches just 10% one Bitcoin could potentially be worth a million.

Thats what people said when the first Bcash big pump happened.  OMG the sky is falling.  Then, crash Bcash plummeted down and Bitcoin took off like a rocket ship.  
When the Billionaire Winklevoss twins start selling their Bitcoin then I will follow.  Until then, I have no time for pump and dump Ver.  
Truth is Bcash isn't even the best transactional coin, you have Litecoin, raiblocks, Monero that do it better.   Bitcoin is the value store and always will be, and it's constantly being worked on.
Bcash is the Bubble because it's the most artificially pumped coin I have ever seen and alot of it is people who missed out on the Bitcoin boat trying to re-capture glory.  I feel bad for those people, they will lose alot of money.

There will only ever be 21 million and less because of the coins that were lost forever.  In my opinion this is more rare than gold.  The price of Bitcoin will be over one million one day in the future.  Why?  Because it's going to be the world currency.  The best minds in the world are working on this technology and continuing to develop it.  The other coins don't stand a chance.  Also, it's been out the longest and is battle tested.    It's been the subject of attacks by hackers, government, and other coins and it continues to shrug it off getting stronger each time.  You do own a piece of history.
@_date: 2017-12-21 01:01:40
Coss will be good once they implement everything they want but they are still in the early stages and not there yet.   They aim to be a one stop shop (crypto one stop shop) both an exchange and trading platform.   Adding Fiat support soon and more coins.

I don’t agree that Crypto is similar to stocks.    I think traditional stocks are tied to traditional fiat and economies.  Fiat economies (and governments) can print money at will and control everything tied to it, including the markets.
Crypto for the most part is controlled by no one so the traditional rules don’t apply.  I do think in the end of all this there will be one crypto that is accepted worldwide and I think altcoins are a risk long term.  Unless you pick the coin that wins out.   I believe it will be Bitcoin in the end, especially with all the worldwide talent contributing to it.

@_date: 2017-12-16 14:14:35
Because bigger block size is only a temporary fix. So essentially BCash is just like putting a bandaid on a serious wound.   Bitcoin developers are working on an infrastructure system change that will render most other coins obsolete.  
Think of BCash as the city of Chicago.  Tons of gun violence and their solution is to build more hospitals.  Not actually dealing with the issue at hand.
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:17:11

This is all speculation but when you see Amazon buying the Amazon Bitcoin and Amazon Ethereum domain, you start to think to yourself that something's up.

This issue will be fixed in the future along with others.

It would be really stupid to sell your Bitcoin now and buy Bitcoin cash.  Someone hit the nail on the head in an earlier post.  People with deep pockets pissed about 2x and are trying to teach the Bitcoin community a lesson.  Not going to work.  Don’t waist your money with the Bitcoin cash shit coin.  Bitcoin literally pooped it out of its rear end.  Just take a look at the other coins that Bitcoin has popped out.  
Now is the perfect buying opportunity.  Give it another month and Bitcoin is $10,000.  You will never see prices this low again.
I bet this is also Bitconnect pumping Bitcoin cash because they are getting rid of their Bitcoin cash wallets and stockpile. 
I’ll buy another Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-11-18 14:08:45

I have a huge conspiracy theory.  I actually tried to post a pro-Bitcoin message and Reddit wouldn’t let me.  
To keep it short.  CME and other big banks are inflating the price of BCH in order to scare us all into selling our Bitcoin and buying into that so they can buy it cheaper.  They will sell of BCH once we’re all in, leaving us with our pants around our ankles.
You think these big banks were planning on paying full price for Bitcoin?  Don’t fall for it.  Hold your Bitcoin and buy more.  Even if it’s only $20.  Fight the big banks and don’t fall for the BCH lure.
@_date: 2017-11-11 19:39:16
They are not trading yet but they are trying to manipulate the Bitcoin price.  They are going to have to hold a lot of Bitcoin to facilitate both sides

Oh my god.  That is such a fake article.

Bankera is another option for a debit card linked to your Crypto accounts.  I still think they are in ICO stage but you can still sign up for the card.

Probably me.  I can’t remember.  I will never do that again.  I put it in the Coinbase vault so now it will take a few days to get it out if I want to.

Dash, Ethereum, Substratum.  I can’t decide which one to sink my money into.  Other than my Bitcoin holdings I loan out on Bitconnect.  On Bitconnect I have worked out a system where I cash out my earnings into Bitcoin one day and then re-invest the next.  This allows me to minimize my risk while still compounding interest.  I’m going to start cashing out my earnings into one of those other coins.

Not delusional.  They are trying to lure people away from Ethereum too.  Look at the Ethereum Classic price, skyrocketing right along with the other forked coin.

No dummeldorf, they are causing the spike in BCH.

Nobody’s buying stuff with Bitcoin right now on a Credit Card level.  It’s small scale.  By the time Bitcoin takes off for real, all this stuff will be fixed

You probably want to call your card company first.  Mine always blocks me the first transaction.

My best guess is down to $350.  It may pump once more, last ditch effort to salvage it.  But Bitcoin will emerge from this like a rocket ship.  I say $8000 for Bitcoin end of November, $10,000 by the new year.
@_date: 2017-11-12 17:42:33
I’ve already done this twice so I learned my lesson.  I use the vault feature on Coinbase where it takes 48 hours to take out of the vault.  Have started to take it out twice now and by the time it gets into my wallet, the crap blows over.  
@_date: 2017-11-18 01:35:34
Is the price getting ready to dip again this weekend?  Looks like another surge from Bitcoin cash.
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:00:17
Might go down a little lower but I wouldn’t risk it.  I would buy now.  You’ll be sorry if you don’t and it blasts past $10,000
@_date: 2017-11-18 12:27:12
It was Coinbase.

Dude don’t do it.  I tried it.  A dip started and I sold.  Then it shot up about $400 in 2 hours.  I had to sell other coins to replenish my lost Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-11-25 21:06:48
Hate to break it to them but I don’t think there is enough for all the big banks to get enough for that sort of manipulation.  I’m a regular guy and I hold a full Bitcoin.  There are many people out there like me.  If all the banks are competing, there will not be enough to go around.  They may be too late to the game.
It’s all good for me though, only makes the price go up.  I’ll sell mine when it hits 500k.
@_date: 2017-11-25 20:54:09
I agree, possibly even higher with all the bank money flowing in.
@_date: 2017-11-25 20:41:52
I bought at $3500.  Almost panic sold when the whole BCH fiasco went down.   Glad I didn’t.  I tried to catch a dip and sell high and buy low.  Made a mistake and had to buy back in at more than I sold for.  Now I am back to 1 full Bitcoin.  The lesson, hold that shit like you never held anything else in your life and don’t touch it.
@_date: 2017-11-28 02:14:59
You could never criminalize Bitcoin, there is no aspect of it that would make it criminal.  You could only criminalize certain actions associated with it.  
Criminalizing Bitcoin would be like criminalizing fine art or antiques.  Now if you use those things to launder money than it’s on you. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 23:16:08

I print out all my two factor barcodes so if I lose my phone, I can just scan it again with a different device.  I also use two devices each time so I’m never relying on one device.

Your so stupid.  Last I checked Amazon bought the Domains for Amazon Bitcoin and Amazon Ethereum.  What does that tell you knumbnuts.  It means get your frigin space helmet on.  Last I checked Bitcoin crash isn’t in the equation.

They timed it right.  They knew what they were doing.  Played into everyone’s Segwit2x  fears and new buyer excitement about Bitcoin.  then hit everyone with a sneak attack.  Brilliant except for the transparency of Ver and Fake Satoshi.

I wouldn’t touch Bitcoin cash with a ten foot pole.  It’s pretty much fake Bitcoin that they are trying to force feed down your throat as real  Bitcoin.  Brilliant attack but it will never work.  Check the numbers on Coinmarketcap.  It’s tanking tonight.  Actually I’m lying. I’ll wait till it goes back down to $350 and then buy a few because it may get pumped again in the future.  Won’t go this high again but maybe $1000.  Then I’ll buy more Bitcoin and submit a few more loans in Bitconnect.

If you buy with a credit card it’s instant but your limits are lower.  If you buy with your bank account it takes a few days.

Just continue to hold.  I’ve learned several hard lessons by selling coins in reaction to a pump.  If you’ve never seen it before, it’s scary.  Not going to say this one didn’t have my pucker factor going, but Bitcoin Cash is falling hard now.  May be a few more attempts at a pump but it’s not looking good for them right now.

Bitcoin will eventually reach 100k easily in the next year or two.  Once these institutional investors come in game over.  They all have partnerships with retailers, etc and will push their invested coin into the mainstream.  By 2021, it could be ridiculous.

A lot of people knock it without understanding the concepts behind it.  It can make you a lot of money and you can minimize the risk easily.  There is a good video about it:
