No, he is being held responsible because he KNOWINGLY made transactions which were suspicious, hid them from the company, and failed to file a suspicious activity report (which he was required to do).
He deliberately and knowingly broke the law, and now is going to do many years of hard time.

Yep.  The guy didnt want to go thru the hassle(and huge cost) of buying  a new url.
So, he started off saving ten bucks, then people thought it was a good idea to give him millions of their dollars to hang onto..

Gone, baby, gone.

Peter basically started the foundation.  I dont see him getting forced out.
The whole foundation is basically scammers and crypto-fascists (aka libertarians).
This wont be the last member of the foundation who ends up in prison.
Birds of a feather...

Mark stole most of the bitcoins and sold them for dollars, thus there are no bitcoins available for withdrawal.
He is going to come out of this a billionaire, and since bitcoin is unregulated, the libertarians will get to experience how a "free market" works.  In other words, he will skate away Scot free, while the rubes cry about how they want their money back!

Law 101.  Never assume.

Hope Andy doesnt spend any of that money, the trustee is going to claw that back.
@_date: 2014-02-07 18:31:06
Of course they would, because libertarianism is a religion.
It involves an invisible sky fairy named Free Market who will always magically set everything right if we just sit back and let Him.
There is no evidence which will help these people recognize logically why their philosophy does not match reality, since they didnt come to the belief of Free Market logically.

Only if you sell them or you spend them.
This is completely wrong.  If you receive bitcoins as income it is a taxable event.
Again, what did you base these conclusions on?

A stock is a share of ownership of a company.
In a ponzi scheme, you give money to the scammer, who then gives you back your money, plus some more money that someone else just gave him.
Of course, most victims then give that money right back to the scammer, and tell him to "reinvest" the profits, so the scammer actually pays out very little and just keeps spending the money until some point in the future when more people want their money back than want to give money to the scammer, and then the whole thing blows up.
The Madoff thing is a good example of the ponzi scheme.  
Madoff set up an account at JP Morgan, then started collecting money from suckers.  He would deposit their checks into his JP Morgan account.  Occasionally he would transfer money from that account to his personal account, and spend it.
The bank would have had to know that he was running a scam, because the only time money came out of the account was when he was transferring it to himself (stealing it) and paying back investors.
They would have seen that he never actually sent any money to any actual investments, despite the fact that he was supposedly running a multi-billion dollar investment company.
The US government eventually settled with JP Morgan and they paid a small fine, but never admitted to any wrongdoing and nobody went to jail.

Yeah right.  
More like, when other exchanges found out how easy it was to steal everyone's bitcoins and blame it on "faulty software", they decided to get in on the act.

Sorry but that's horrible advice.
If you receive bitcoins as income, they should be declared as income when received, not treated as capital gains when you sell them.
I also just read your FAQ page and it is almost completely wrong.  I am curious where you came to these conclusions, and what you based them on.  
@_date: 2014-01-27 19:01:56
Yeah, except for being born filthy stinking rich.
Wish I had their luck...

I wonder how many bitcoiners have the "I want to believe" poster on the wall next to their computer...
@_date: 2014-02-25 17:53:46
You are assuming that Mt Gox's definition of "cold wallet" is the same as your definition.
Basically they never had a "cold" wallet using the definition that most people use.

How many days until Mark Karpeles becomes the 2nd member of the Bitcoin Foundation to be indicted on Federal charges?
My guess is 30 days.
@_date: 2014-02-25 19:49:58
Not during the time that he committed the fraud.
After he left that job, he started up his ponzi scheme, so he wasnt ever technically regulating himself.
Now there are bankers who sit on the board of the Fed while running banks, which would be an example of regulating yourself.
@_date: 2014-02-07 15:22:44
Yep, the same reason people used Bernie Madoff.
It works great, for a while.....

From my experience with bitcoin people, many of them think that many of the most basic accounting functions are something archaic that you dont need to worry about with bitcoin and the fancy blockchain.

Sounds like Gavin is frantically trying to book a plane ticket somewhere warm and tropical where he can spend all his new bitcoins in peace and quiet!
