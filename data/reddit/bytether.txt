Bitcoin is like Gold, it is good to hold value but it is not good for payment. What is the point of a currency where it costs you about 3 USD for each transaction and you have to wait for long until the transaction is confirmed?
Bytether is to solve that problem, we cross fork Bitcoin to Ethereum, therefore anybody who has Bitcoin will have BTH. The benefit of this CrossFork is you can still own your Bitcoin but can claim the same amount BTH.
BTH focus on making payment easy, cheap (about 20 cents per txn), secure and fast.

BTC is well-known but slow and expensive. 
ETH is faster and cheaper but there is no cap, it doesn't have a good support for a currency compare to BTC.
There are a lot of people believe in cryptocurrency, they already hold BTC. We do a cross-fork to make the transition a lot easier.
Bytether(BTH) main focus is to build a payment ecosystem, after all BTC is a currency but it is not easy to spend. We want to change that.
"It is undeniable that Bitcoin is the most well-known cryptocurrency, yet the fundamental implementation of Bitcoin built its own obstacles such as low transaction speed and high transaction fee. Ethereum is much better in that concerns.
No doubt there are quite a few other coins trying to replicate Bitcoin on Etherum network but Bytether is different. We do cross-fork from Bitcoin blockchain to Ethereum network to provide a better currency and enable Bitcoin holders to instantly on-board. Bytether is the real equivalent Bitcoin on the Etherum network. 
Cryptocurrencies payment is still inaccessible to many parties due to Bitcoin lack of the smart contract and discrepancy between various ERC20 tokens. Bytether, on the other hand, focuses itself around payment and payment only. With a specialized smart contract, Bytether can handle complicated payment transactions."

We have 5 devs working on the project with ton of experience on payment.
