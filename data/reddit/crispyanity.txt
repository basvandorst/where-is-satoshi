Investing in crypto sucks now lol.
@_date: 2018-01-24 02:36:02
This ain't new investors, this is like 99% of the people here lol. Including myself.
@_date: 2018-01-27 16:47:34
Fuck that, give me real tangible money when you're dealing with that amount lol.
@_date: 2018-01-23 03:29:47
I'm honestly just waiting for it to hit like $18k+ and I'm out.
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:31:49
Fuck that's true.
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:22:08
Or be broke at 90.
@_date: 2017-12-14 02:03:29
Yes definitely. I made sure that the amount I was investing wasn't too much that if I lost it all I'd be homeless. Pissed off sure, but not financially ruined.
@_date: 2017-12-31 19:15:10
Hopefully not!
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:07:47
Perfect! Thank you.
@_date: 2017-12-29 18:11:11
People talk about cryptocurrency being free from banks and whatnot but I don't think trading that for control being in the hands of a bunch of sharks and self-taught developers is a good trade. Fraud and corruption are already ripe in the crypto game, I'm rapidly losing faith.
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:54:30
Things you should also consider:
- Don't take advice from strangers on the internet without doing your own, in-depth research.
@_date: 2017-12-18 00:57:17
QuadrigaCX is the best for Canadians. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:21:20
If you know it's going down overnight, why not sell and re-buy?
No one here are real investors. Holding just ensures you don't need to think.
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:58:46
It's more for tracking different investments from different people bought at different times.
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:43:41
I like how people on this sub think that they understand what's going on more than financial investors on Wall Street.
You, like the rest of us, have no idea what the fuck you're doing or what the fuck is going on.
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:16:23
Because most people in this sub have no fucking clue what they're doing, so it's easier to "hold" because they don't have to think.
@_date: 2017-12-02 16:37:03
They probably still see you as the top guy lol, they just listen.
@_date: 2017-12-16 18:47:04
Meh, Facebook is also a hell of a lot more stable.
@_date: 2017-12-31 18:04:09
Bitcoin is still controlled by people. This whole "decentralization" thing is mostly bullshit.
@_date: 2017-12-31 18:57:05
It will be governmemt-controlled eventually.
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:11:30
QuadrigaCX is where it's at.
@_date: 2017-12-31 22:54:35
If I bought $2000 worth of bitcoin and it gained $2000 in value and I withdraw $2000 but leave $2000 in my wallet, I do not have to claim any income. I haven't gained any money because the $2000 still in my wallet is the profit, not what I took out.
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:23:04
90% of the people in this sub just want to get rich and don't give a fuck what Bitcoin is supposed to represent.
@_date: 2017-12-02 21:02:21
I think maybe 1% of people that own BitCoin use this sub, so I doubt that has any baring.
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:01:07
Fucking damn right. I'm coming back to this sub in a few days when everyone has stopped being retarded.
Obvious attack from r/bch it's painful.
@_date: 2017-12-31 18:56:22
To make money.
@_date: 2017-12-29 16:28:40
And what a shit month it's been lol.
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:14:40
I'm selling and re-buying.
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:26:37
This sub is turning into T_D level of inside jokes lol.
@_date: 2017-12-31 19:06:59
The government is corrupt because of people. Cryptocurrency is controlled by people.
Crypto is already corrupt actually.
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:56:43
This post is literally filled with people from r/bch lol. Give it a day or two and they will fuck off and bitcoin will hit more record highs.
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:58:14
Why the fuck are y'all transferring like $9 of bitcoin at a time? You're all so full of shit, fuck off. Just looking for something to attack bitcoin with but hey, give it a day or two and we'll hit record highs again. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:42:33
I'm in the "hold but you could die tomorrow so cash out some and buy shit" group. Fuck holding forever, but don't be stupid and cash out everything at the first sign of trouble.
@_date: 2017-12-31 19:07:34
Government-employed developers. Done.
@_date: 2017-12-05 04:28:31
This post is better than almost every post I have ever seen on this sub. Bravo.
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:26:22
Yup, no one here seems to understand that.
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:27:34
Hardly anyone is abandoning shit lol, it's already going back up.
@_date: 2017-12-14 01:29:09
There is nothing wrong with buying into bitcoin in order to make quick money. I just paid for vacation and Christmas with bitcoin interest, and that was my only intention. I don't care what cryprocurrency represents really; I like my life and I have no issues with the current banking system and our Canadian government. I use bitcoin to make money quick, and I have.
@_date: 2017-12-27 15:36:25
Once it hits like $25k CAD I'm out. Way too volatile for me, bad investment overall. I highly doubt bitcoin will stay on top over the next few years, too much shit is going on.
@_date: 2017-12-02 16:23:03
No point holding everything forever. You could die tomorrow, spend bitcoin. Congrats in being debt free.
@_date: 2017-12-31 22:50:58
Meh, sell sometimes. I paid for an entire vacation and Christmas with bitcoin profits. You haven't made shit until you convert it to real money and you could die tomorrow.
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:58:48
I saw a video where a guy spent like $2,000 and changed the lives of 500 children, bought them everything they needed, helped build a school, and build a well.
So tell me, what the FUCK have charities been doing for decades?
Donating to charities is the equivalent of "here take my money so I feel like I'm making a difference without actually doing anything."
Want to enact real change? Get out the house and go do something.
@_date: 2017-12-02 07:46:35
Everything is only worth what someone is willing to pay for it.
@_date: 2018-05-12 18:57:01
If you can't verify your account you are doing things that are probably sketchy.
@_date: 2018-05-12 19:15:29
So you don't get to trade. Put your parents credit card back.
@_date: 2019-02-28 19:12:07
It's lost all trust in the majority of people, and anyone even thinking of getting into it at this point is going to run away. It will be at $2K next year, probably $500 the year after, then pennies.
@_date: 2019-02-28 21:18:14
If they don't regulate it, it will never be anything but a way to buy drugs online. Simple as that. You need oversight to stop people stealing shit, which every exchange is currently involved in.
@_date: 2019-02-28 19:06:33
Crypto is basically dead, it was fun while it lasted I guess lol.
@_date: 2017-11-25 10:37:10
Computer programmer. And I know nothing about how bitcoin works.
@_date: 2019-02-28 21:16:58
Nah it's because if you have an unregulated market, people are likely to steal. Simple as that. Almost every exchange is involved in lawsuits.
@_date: 2017-11-03 03:49:00
I did, and I've already made 20%. Ridiculous.
Do you think it will dip in the next fork?
@_date: 2019-02-28 19:09:18
Lmao, except gold slowly goes up and always will. Bitcoin is worth fuck all now basically, and it will never ever get back to it's former glory, ever. Guaranteed it'll be at like $2K USD next year, then $500 the year after.
@_date: 2019-02-28 19:59:17
Oh I bought years ago and paid for two Christmas' and vacation with the profits lol, I'm not in that group. I just think it's done. Nobody gives a fuck anymore, and the only reason it ever was worth something is because of hype. Hype is dead and won't come back, especially in this day and age, nobody gives a fuck about old news.
@_date: 2019-02-28 19:07:12
Every single exchange is corrupt. Crypto is basically dead.
@_date: 2019-02-28 20:01:08
Look around you lol. This sub is dead, the hype is dead, news outlets literally don't even post articles about crypto anymore because they get no clicks.
@_date: 2019-02-28 23:04:20
It's a start for sure.
@_date: 2017-11-26 18:29:36
11.9k CAD. We eatin' nuts all day in Canada.
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:37:37
It's because it's hard to diversify your investments when you see Bitcoin making 25x more than anything else.
@_date: 2017-11-17 21:04:36
What's supposed to happen on November 24?
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:35:42
^ The best advice in here.
If you're thinking about investing, imagine someone stole that amount of money from you and you had no way of getting it back. Are you now screwed? If so, invest less.
@_date: 2017-11-19 16:32:39
I honestly don't see the point in not cashing out at all, even a bit. Personally I'm buying all my Christmas presents with the profit from Bitcoin. It makes no sense to hold forever.
@_date: 2017-11-18 18:40:09
Except nobody even knows wtf Bitcoin Cash is lol.
@_date: 2017-11-11 16:58:22
I love it! I was waiting for a drop to buy a real amount. Keep the drop coming!
@_date: 2017-11-20 23:15:36
I bought in at $9900 CAD and it hung there for a couple days of course lol. Going back up now though, all aboard!
@_date: 2017-11-18 03:19:50
Yeah just when I bought some lol.
@_date: 2017-11-10 17:41:00
@_date: 2017-11-20 23:16:19
Fuck yeah.
@_date: 2019-02-28 21:23:30
Bullshit, I'm not talking about random people that work there. Most exchanges are corrupt from the core founders down.
@_date: 2017-11-24 02:32:37
At this stage, these ATM's just seem like a weird waste of money.
@_date: 2017-11-18 18:43:23
QuadrigaCX is where it's at.
@_date: 2017-11-19 17:41:03
Obviously food and guns are valuable, but gold will also always have value. There are lots of practical uses for gold no matter the economic situation.
@_date: 2017-11-10 15:36:51
I bought at $7200 (CAD), sold at $9600. Now I'm waiting to buy a while lot more but I'm waiting. The drop has finally begun.
@_date: 2017-11-25 10:36:09
This sub has already approached r/TheDonald level inside jokes. Except we're all making money. ��
@_date: 2017-11-25 10:38:39
You just forgot about 10k? Or is that what it should be worth now.
@_date: 2017-11-19 17:32:48
Exactly! Who knows how long we've got, why not enjoy the profits now?
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:46:32
Yup I know what it means lol.
@_date: 2017-11-26 00:37:11
Christmas is free this year!
@_date: 2017-11-13 23:36:33
The .com is a way better looking site that functions way cleaner.
Want to stay on top? Be better.
@_date: 2017-11-11 17:20:22
Nobody knows wtf Bitcoin Cash is. Sure, on here people do, but ask 1000 regular people on the street and maybe 5 will have heard of it.
Ask 1000 people what Bitcoin is and the majority of people will say they've heard of it.
That is the real value, and this is coming from someone that wants Bitcoin to keep dropping so he can buy.
@_date: 2018-03-22 15:39:41
Says the guy who doesn't know how to make money lol. Twitters revenue is embarrassing.
@_date: 2018-02-03 18:37:05
Its shit for Canadians.
@_date: 2018-02-03 18:39:04
In Canada, I use interac online.
How can they possibly stop you from buying something? How do they know what you're buying?
@_date: 2018-03-30 21:54:35
Once it hits a specific price I'm out.
@_date: 2017-10-21 18:44:28
Thank you for the long reply. I'm the kind of person that does my own research inside a store on products they sell to get the best deal instead of listening to the sales clerk so I am no stranger to making decisions based on my own research.
I just wanted to combine my own research with a collection of candid answers from real people in the real world who are invested. Simply utilizing every outlet possible.
Good advice about turning a vice into an investment, I was already thinking that. That's exactly what I may do to start off.
