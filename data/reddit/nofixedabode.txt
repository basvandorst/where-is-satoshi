I created the UI for the Digital Monetary Trust and Laissez Faire City's stock/specie exchange (called LESE).
DMT had some innovations that BTC also shares, for example both use public keys for account numbers. Its downfall was indeed that it was centralized, and relied on a complex network of bank-transfer agents to handle incoming/outgoing transfers.
It was developed in the San Jose Costa Rica's embassy district, mainly in the old Nicaraguan ambassador's residence (which was pretty cool, the SJ cops had to call the Nicaraguan government for permission to enter the premises). Later its operational offices were moved to Dubai (I had left the project before that point).
To my knowledge Grabbe was not in contact with Satoshi - there was not a lot of cross-pollination between the LFC project and the the crypto community. We did, however, work with Phil Zimmerman (I also designed the first OpenPGP website and LFC was a founding member of the consortium that he created). I kept up to date with Nick Szabo's work on smart contracts, and was aware of Hal Finney due to my involvement in the Extropians community back in the 90s.
Shortly before I left the project, we developed DMT bearer certificates - users could convert part of their DMT holdings to a digital certificate that could be transferred and redeemed by any other DMT account holder. That was the closest we got to anything resembling a currency or stock certificate (although you could transfer our Rand 'currency' within the system and use on the LESE).
