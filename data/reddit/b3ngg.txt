@_date: 2018-01-22 14:43:01
Nah man, this is just to check if this is feeling is normal of if I'm just dead inside. haha 
But nice to see that I am not alone. Maybe this post can calm some weak hands down as well.

This is no theory. It's literally written on the contract. That´s the expiration date of the contracts.

Deep down I know that a will scoop up your coins for a nice bargain. :D

Can only recommend checking out his channel, really informative and presented in a very funny way (including top notch memes). ;)

Are you retarded? haha
The whole market cap of all crypto is 530 billion. How can they steal 700 billion. you damn idiot. haha
It was 530 million btw. Stop spreading FUD without knowing anything about the situation. 
@_date: 2018-01-26 08:35:05
The contracts won't. But people pooping their pants and sell-off because they have no idea what's happening will tank the price.
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:16:56
Lol, he gave a shout out to me! Am I dead? Is this what heaven feels like? Despide the correction, this made my day. :)

Same for me...at some point it becomes normal. You can't be on freak out mode 24/7 with 300 bpm.
@_date: 2018-01-23 15:04:07
Of course I check them once in a while. The point of this post is that I feel indifferent about the movements of the price. At the beginning i was freaking out at -10%. Now when I look at the prices and they drop significantly I don't feel anything. It's like: "Ah, okay..(closes browser and continues with life)" .
@_date: 2018-01-26 08:14:42
It would have no impact, if people wouldn't poop their pants left and right and sell. "OMG UNCERTAINTY!!! 26th end of the world!!1!one!1!"

Oh, so I see you have no idea how the cryptomarket works...you have disqualified yourself from any valid discussion. Now go on an spread your unbacked information (even though you think you have figured it all out).
@_date: 2018-01-26 08:39:23
BS. Price dropping because noobs fear the expiry of bitcoin futures on wallstreet today.
@_date: 2018-01-26 10:57:14
Omg are you retarded? That's the problem of exchanges. The exchange got hacked, not bitcoin itself. Bitcoin never got hacked a single time since it was launched. Wow, you really have no idea of how this works and you try to spread FUD. Did you even read the article? Bitcoin is unhackable at the moment.
@_date: 2018-01-26 11:36:08
Hahah, this is so funny. You have absoluteley no idea and logic, yet you spread wrong info like a big boy. Educate yourself before you post.

Not first investment in general. But first investment into crypto? Certainly. I mean you won't see this swings anywhere else, even if you are a veteran investor on wallstreet.

Nope, they are quitting their jobs at Google, Facebook etc. left and right. Just look up the team members. They are working full-time on this.

@_date: 2018-02-02 11:02:36
Just check this india ban FUD. The finance minister just said that they want to regulate all illegal activities regarding bitcoin, and it will not be accepted as legal tender in india. Here they claim "INDIA JUST BANNED BITCOIN!!!!".
Damn idiots. USD is also not accepted as legal tender in India, no currency except indian rupees.

@_date: 2018-02-02 01:41:29
Nah man. I'm good. But seeing all this FUD victims losing their shit is really annoying. Downward spiral. They are victims of fake FUD dragging down other weak hands.

Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt. So nothing really happened, the fundamentals are the same, but people are scared so they sell off, because the future is uncertain.
