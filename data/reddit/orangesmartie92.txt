I'm in the process of buying my first full bitcoin. But I wanted to try mining as a hobby. I live in Quebec where electricity is pretty cheap (all in CAD: 0.0582$/kWh for the first 33kwh per day and 0.0823$/kwh for the rest with a flat rate of 0.42$/day). On average I spend about 200$ per month on electricity (family of 5). And using these metrics I would spend about 30-35$ extra per month if I used antminer s9 for 24/7. 
Gathering that on estimate/average I can pull in about 0.1-0.25 BTC per month. I could earn more or less about 1-3 bitcoins this year. If the trend continues as we see it (if bitcoin price can reach 10k CAD (right now it's almost 6k CAD) one year from now), then that means I will have paid off for the equipment and electricity and have a nice passive income.
Maybe I'm too optimistic and this is a waste of time, but I feel it's worth a try.
And yeah, cloud mining seems tempting at first but then you realise that these websites would just keep the bitcoin if they made actual money.

I haven't done google 2fa if that's what you mean. But I'm purchasing antminer s9 and I guess join a pool. Or do you think I should be solo And buy/sell extra hashrate at nicehash?  
What's a good suggestion for a noob in reference to pools (if I should join or which ones I should join)
Thanks in advance

Which mining pool is ok by your standards?

Honestly not a good look. Please don't ask for donations here. That's not what this subreddit is for. If you're scared of investing because of losing some money then you shouldn't be here. Spend 20$ on some alt coins and see if you can thrive.

Gemini if you're American or quadrigacx if you're Canadian.

Tbh, I use mycelium because it's easy to use and you can dictate the priority level of your transactions so if you're not so much in a rush, you're miners fee could be set lower.
About USD/BTC exchanges though, bitfinex has low trade fees (0-0.2%). Gemini has low trade fees (0-0.25%). Gemini has free transactions but you can't do electronic funds transfer or interac. Bitfinex charges 0.1% or min 20$ fee for bank wires. They also don't do interac. Bitfinex I hear usually have lower buy prices than coinbase or Gemini.
@_date: 2017-09-02 00:13:49
Does that mean that the transaction fee will pay for the electricity cost of powering this whole system?
@_date: 2017-09-06 18:16:19
Unless you meant transacting a large amount of money and then buying 10$ worth everyday. Thats not a bad idea
@_date: 2017-09-08 06:44:48
R/Bitcoinmining is probably where you should ask your mining questions

Trying to fund my account.. and it would not let me. Asked my sister if it was the same for her. And it was. Its not just the app. Honestly... this is why blockchain technology is more promising and why i believe in its future.

For USD, bitfinex has low trade fees (0-0.2%). Gemini has low trade fees (0-0.25%). Gemini has free transactions but you can't do electronic funds transfer or interac. Bitfinex charges 0.1% or min 20$ fee for bank wires. They also don't do interac. Bitfinex I hear usually have lower buy prices than coinbase or Gemini.
For CAD, use quadrigacx or coinsquare. Quadrigacx has lower interac funding fees (1.5%) than coinsquare (2.5%) but coinsquare has lower trade fees (0-0.4%) than quadrigacx(0.2-0.5%).

This guy is a dunce. He said he unloaded money into one of his bank accounts. Why would you withdraw money without figuring out a safe way to do it? There are numerous ways of doing it nowadays that i feel i dont even believe his story.
How does one go in, thinking theres a support or customer service behind a decentralized money system. 
Whoever this guy is needs to pull down his article because its embarassing.
@_date: 2017-09-03 08:07:14
You can share your address to your recipient or if you're the recipient. That's how you pass bitcoins. But do not do what this person is doing. Don't come into this subreddit to ask for donations.

Quadrigacx is the  Canadian site. Withdraws/deposits can be free with bank wires. They charge 1.5% for e-interac and 5% for electronic funds transfer. 
Trade fees are 0.5%. 
I like their website. It's easy to use.
@_date: 2017-09-05 13:12:44
If you're Canadian, coinsquare and quadrigacx have low trade fees. Quadrigacx has lower funding fees than coinsquare.
If youre american, Gemini has low trade fees and transaction fees.

Youll waste money on transaction fees if you do it this way. Unless you are able to find an exchange that does interac funding for free (which to my knowledge, there are none that are safe/reliable). 
Just do it on a weekly or bi- weekly basis if you can. Use exchanges with low transaction fees / trade fees.

People have the misconception that they are banning bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 02:21:08
His article makes no sense. He said he  forgot his bitcoins in his digital wallet that was on his phone that he no longer owned with a number he no longer recalled (which if he was smart, he would have backed up his account and kept his password somewhere, wouldnt have been a problem). Then he said he found his bitcoins on his coinbase account(and apparently he installed the coinbase exchange onto his desktop? Didnt even know it was possible). So which one is it?
Then he said as soon as he sold his bitcoins, it would withdraw into one of his bank accounts that he forgot about.  Dont you need to manually withdraw from your account after you sell? And isnt there many options to withdraw? It doesnt just automatically withdraw into your account from my knowledge. 
Then he doesnt know the point of bitcoin, and that theres a company behind it. Then he doesnt know that theres 8 decimal points and doesnt go by the single unit. 
Hes embarassing himself really

Tbh if its too good to be true, it probably is.
If its in your bad conscience that you're helping them money launder by using the service, then you shouldnt do it.
But if you dont care and just want to know if you can profit off it, then only invest a small sum that you are prepared to lose. But be aware, they might make it legit the firsr or second time and steal your money the third. Just be careful. But i always say, if its that easy, then everyone would do it.
@_date: 2017-09-02 07:33:57
Canadian. I can't compare the exchange markets because American bitcoin exchange is slightly different  from Canadian bitcoin exchange.
@_date: 2017-09-06 05:17:13
Ill just copy what i wrote to someone.
For USD, bitfinex has low trade fees (0-0.2%). Gemini has low trade fees (0-0.25%). Gemini has free transactions but you can't do electronic funds transfer or interac. Bitfinex charges 0.1% or min 20$ fee for bank wires. They also don't do interac. Bitfinex I hear usually have lower buy prices than coinbase or Gemini.
For CAD, use quadrigacx or coinsquare. Quadrigacx has lower interac funding fees (1.5%) than coinsquare (2.5%) but coinsquare has lower trade fees (0-0.4%) than quadrigacx(0.2-0.5%).
@_date: 2017-09-13 02:03:12
You can use quadrigacx. They have a rate of 1.5%. So on 1000$, itll be 15$ instead of 25$.

Esp  Cashing out goes directly to your bank account. The government will know about large sums.
@_date: 2017-09-02 07:55:22
Ahhh ok. I see. You know at this point, think of it as a donation. To someone who was pathetic enough they had to scan people.
@_date: 2017-09-02 07:46:23
Ah man that sucks. In the future, only trade with reputable websites. If you are American, coinbase and Gemini. If you're Canadian it's quadrigacx. Don't be fooled by interest rates and get rich quick schemes.
