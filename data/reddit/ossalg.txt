No, more like making fun of his crocodile tears, horrible acting, and moronic claim that BCH is the "real Bitcoin." He's a Bitcoin Benedict Arnold.
He also served a federal prison sentence for mailing explosives many, many years ago. Roger Ver is a cunt.

You are likely right, but I'd also caution that you could be wrong. The skeleton meme is very appropriate for you.

Pepper_Jack_Jesus has supposedly worked with "finance and technology" for nearly 40 years, as such he looks down on all us lowly peasants who don't have $1,000,000 or more in Bitcoin (don't worry, spoiler! He doesn't either). Here's a gem from his history...
"Fuckiing old 40 year old feminist bitchs have sure done a number on western civilization. People who object to this age gap need to STFU and mind teir own business.
Lets talk about wite girls who date black men to get back at teir daddy and prove to temselves tey aren't racist by sucking the black dick. Wo is using wo in tat scenario tat happens all over every liberal college campus."
I'm guessing you're...17? Probably do have some decently well-off parents and a little bit of crypto stashed away (likely under 0.1). Are you the reincarnation of Elliot Rodger?
@_date: 2017-11-30 02:23:49
Here's the deal - the fact that you have no established financial system in place to store regular fiat should be your first order of business. Talk to your parent/guardian and explain that you would like to open a savings/checking account at a reputable financial institution. Don't bother with credit cards until you are older and fully understand the potential ramifications of their use. Don't buy crypto on credit. 
Do you have a part-time job? If not, get one. How else will you fund your crypto purchases? 
You have some work to do before you consider buying crypto.
Also, it's not illegal to have crypto at any age, unless the methods you're using to obtain said crypto is illegal (using a parent's credit card to purchase. That's still stealing).

I have no tolerance for Ver or his cronies. He continues to lead an assault on the financial futures of countless people. Fuck him.

Also, we're talking about currency and store of value, not what photo sharing social media platform kids are using. So much money is tied up in Bitcoin by people who have vested financial interest. Most users of MySpace, Facebook, etc. have no interest in the financial success of the company. They just want to make sure they can share pictures of their trip, message a group of friends, and tell the world they've been dating the love of their life for a week.
We WANT BTC to succeed, and because of that, it just might. We've been told for 5-7 years that the floor will fall out, and it hasn't yet. Get the FUD out of here.

To rub it in the faces of Segwit2X supporters. It feels so good, trust me.

It's not that scary. As the price of Bitcoin increases, its runs will be in the thousands of dollars, not hundreds. It's about percentages. Hold on and buy what you can at dips. You are witnessing something incredible. Correction is inevitable, but don't try and time it.
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:01:08
Massive influx in interest led to soaring ATHs...correction was inevitable as traders take profits. We'll lose some weak hands as we dip a bit, then keep climbing.

You weren't in Bitcoin for the tech and it's obvious. Enjoy your fruitless pursuits.
@_date: 2017-11-27 01:10:56
Percentage-wise, this isn't really out of the ordinary. The amount only seems crazy because it's hard to wrap our heads around the fact that BTC is insanely valuable. What's bad was BCH tripling in value overnight. 
When BTC is conceivably worth hundreds of thousands of USD, it will gain or lose tens of thousands during runs.

You are much stronger than you were when you woke up today. You will continue to be tested. Hodling is the ultimate game of roshambo. Sometimes you'll want to give in to the pain of watching money seemingly evaporate in front of your eyes. 
Grab your dick and get some ice cream. Turn your PC off for the day and do something productive. Check back in a few days. Your blue balls will be cured by the inevitable load you'll drop seeing that your 20% loss is completely erased and you're making a run for greatness. 
Enjoy that fucking Lamborghini and FFS HODL. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:06:40
That's great. Nearly the same return as the U.S. stock markets this year in mere days. And this has been a banner year for stocks. My 401k and Roth IRA are both up around 20% this year. My crypto is shitting all over them. Either way I'll be set long term :)
Edit: Corrected stock market increase from "week" to "year."

He's a cunt, anyways. He has nothing of value to offer the crypto community. Fuck 'em.

I don't think it's going to be a single Bitcoin like many believe. Not if you're going to "retire" in the traditional sense. But I honestly don't think you would need to invest more than 10 or 15k now to be doing pretty well for yourself in twenty years time.
@_date: 2017-11-22 02:27:31
Oh my god SHUT UP. We all know you have .04 BTC that you purchased on Coinbase and paid ACH fees on, and move your BTC between Coinbase and the BitPay wallet. Sweet Jesus shut up lest you go deeper into negative karma.
@_date: 2017-11-02 21:15:43
With $150 you can buy ~.0214 BTC. May not sound like much, but if Bitcoin is indeed the future and you keep buying some little by little, it'll be the best $150 you ever spend.
Get a Coinbase account and use GDAX limit orders. Store your coin in a good software wallet until you have enough to warrant a hardware wallet. Good luck!

What's to discuss? Bitcoin is getting stronger, and some criminals are just profiting off an alt. We're shedding the deadweight of weak hands. The same people who are enthusiastic about BCH are just excited about the price pump. They were sucking BTC's dick a week ago.

You realize competition is healthy and has actually only asserted Bitcoin's place as the dominant player in cryptocurrency, right? For the many of us that treat BTC more as a speculative investment than a day-to-day means of exchange, Bitcoin IS skyrocketing away from competitors. BTC is nearly 4x bigger than Ethereum, and nearly 7x bigger than than BCH, which so many misguided souls actual think will overtake BTC.
Bitcoin has survived events and attacks that would have crushed nearly all other technologies in their infancy. It's resilient and time and again proves its strength. Could that end some day? Sure. But there's no player in the market that stands ready to supplant Bitcoin as the superior product.
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:35:20
Supposedly those of us who believe in the one true Bitcoin are somehow supposed to cordially NOT gloat about this? I've read so many Reddit comments that gleefully claimed Bitcoin was on the verge of dying.
Please. You can't kill Bitcoin. 2X was always a scam and I'm glad this project is dead. Let it serve as a warning for anyone that tries to start a scam fork in the future.

Here's another great post from the profile of u/Pepper_Jack_Jesus...
"Meh. I told a few friends that my BTC holdings are now over $1,000,000. They were surprised/impressed and had a few questions. Had an intersting discussion about how it's priced, pulling it out, taxation, etc. Of course, my friends aren't dirt poor failures in life and already worth as much or more."

It's not ego. I welcome changes to Bitcoin that strengthen Crypto, properly enact security measures, bring the community together, and aren't just a pump/dump scam. 2X was none of those things. You're welcome to join us back in the world of the one true Bitcoin, but I suspect your own ego prevents you from doing so. I'm guessing you're in Crypto for the wrong reasons. 
@_date: 2017-10-31 23:45:51
"Only made $20K before taxes." Hypothetically speaking, you would have made that profit on a relatively small initial investment. Don't look at BTC as a way to make USD. Fatal mistake. Crypto IS the future of currency. Put what you can into Bitcoin. Your government issued fiat is shit and will only get shittier.
