How do we know this is the genesis of btc? Why do people send fractions of btc to this adress? Why are there so many 0.00000558 btc transactions? 
I have so many questions

Much appreciated

There isn't really a quick guide/explanation for Bitcoin, I'd suggest watching a few videos on Youtube to get an idea of the concept.

Do you have a link to that Reddit post? That sounds interesting
@_date: 2019-05-30 23:45:39
