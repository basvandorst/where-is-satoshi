It seems like both sides of this Argument are strongly emotionally attached to this debate. Why tho? Subreddits of most cryptocurrencies read like fanpages of european soccer clubs. Everbody seems to have it all figured out, while trashing other ideas. Thats not doing anybody a favor. Chill out guys please

Good points i understand your side better now. I would really like to see more argument based Opposition like your comment to "the other currency"��. So far i mostly saw insults and name calling from both sides.

wait what? People are really that stupid? All of those experts make public Statements without any education on the topic.
@_date: 2018-02-14 00:52:45
I got the same amount of both since the day it forked. So i cant develop any bias

buy high. learned from Previous mistake ��
@_date: 2018-02-14 00:51:44
I see what you did there ����
@_date: 2018-02-19 07:05:37
wait. so your saying investing in solid coins is useless? 
@_date: 2018-02-20 17:52:31
no your store looks the same and prices are also cheap

On a side note not every scientist agrees on anthropogene Climate change so there are also scientist as "deniers". Science never worked based on consensus, but thats for a different  subreddit��. I think there should always be a Dialogue, if the opposite is so wrong then prove it with arguments just like you did��
@_date: 2018-02-20 17:47:50
there are though. But i dont mind, your store just looks very similar to those cheap jewelry dropshipping stores
@_date: 2018-02-20 16:51:31
this is a dropshipping site come on dont Fool us 
@_date: 2018-02-18 10:07:23
hahah how do you come up with that? 
@_date: 2018-02-14 19:01:07
thanks for the thread i felt this horrible cringe over the last 3 months watching these videos of prank youtubers suddenly becoming crypto experts. Good to know im not the only one
@_date: 2018-02-13 23:08:05
Thats exactly what i meant..whats the truth though. Im curious, maybe then i can understand the anger.
@_date: 2018-02-13 23:25:34
Agreed. The "bitcoin core" thing is ridiculous. Nevertheless I still dont get the whole hate between the two sides, thats not a good base for constructive  discussion and i would put the listing of "bitcoin core" in the same category. Its just some bullshit that doesnt help anybody, a small bullshit attack
@_date: 2018-02-25 17:13:53
You got something twisted there..you should spend it, but you shouldnt Panic Sell��
