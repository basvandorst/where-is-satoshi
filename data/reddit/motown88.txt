I read parts of the white paper. But to expect that "anyone" who wants to get into bitcoin needs to read it? That's precisely one of the problems with bitcoin right now. Those that are invested in it already want it to grow its user base, but at the same time expect that those new to bitcoin to read a paper that will almost surely discourage them from using it due its perceived complexity. 
Perhaps as a community we need more effort in educating the masses about bitcoin without just pointing them to a technical paper

@_date: 2014-10-20 16:55:51
Why not go with a Colored coin? You could issue a colored coin to represent each partner's share of the business. Then simply issue a dividend, in bitcoin, and each holder of the partner coins will be paid based upon their ownership %. This can easily be done via coinprism.com

Hello! CPA/bitcoin investor here. Since there is no official IRS guidance this is a very tough topic. 
First, how did you get your coins? Did you mine them? Or did you buy them from someone/thing like coinbase? 
If you minded them first then sold at an exchange you have business income, You need to fill out schedule C -small business income. Using your proceeds from mined coins at exchanges reduced by your expenses related to mining.
If you sold your mined coins for USD and then buy back into BTC then trade in and out for USD, or bought bitcoins to begin with (think coinbase), then you are "investing" and would report any gains, or losses (up to a point) from trading on schedule D - Capital Gains and Losses. This would be a big pain since you now need to determine how much USD you made on every trade(after fees) to determine your gain or loss to report.
However, if you were trading BTC for LTC, or similar, then you are never really receiving USD. Instead I see this a reducing your cost basis of the BTC you originally purchased. This would be much simpler to report. You would essentially take the ending USD value of your BTC less the the beginning value. This should get you to your gain/loss.
Feel free to ask any questions if you are preparing your own taxes.

Not counting a massive failure of the bitcoin protocol, I would bet on bitcoin any day. If I only had the money lol
@_date: 2014-11-03 20:01:21
With most brokerages you indicate the shares you are selling. Either the oldest, newest, or some combination that would minimize or maximize your cap. gains. With Bitcoin you could do the same thing but it is extremely hard to prove which coins you are buying and selling if they are in the same wallet. I would say keep you're long term Hodl coins in one wallet and your short term trading coins in another.

@_date: 2014-04-10 17:53:59
I would recommend using a multi Signature account like bitgo.com. I buy all my coins from coinbase and then send them to my bitgo wallet. 
The site has 1 key. you keep 2 keys. print your 2 keys (you do this when you open your bitgo wallet) and put it in a safe deposit box. You don't need the keys if you are just going to deposit coins and not take them out until his 18th B day
@_date: 2014-03-30 15:40:12
Most merchants that accept bitcoin are selling to USD instantly. So in essence you sell to them they sell to avoid market risk and now your left assuming the coins will be purchased by someone at coin base or another exchange

Yes, I paid my Dish Bill, $60.41 ((0.12015549 BTC) an exchange rate of $502.7/btc and and when I paid via my Circle account the equivalent was $60.76 which is just half of one percent difference in exchange rate. I then bought back $61 (0.12063 BTC) which is about $505.6 exchange rate
@_date: 2014-10-05 01:43:54
Don't worry. I bought in at like $900 and thought I was a genius. I've since learned that the price is unpredictable and that these are the best times to buy. My average is sub $600 now
@_date: 2014-03-17 17:48:31
Correct me if I'm wrong, but there is no official ISO code for Bitcoin. The  world will use the abbreviation they see as a best fit. They will gravitate towards the one that makes the most sense. Lastly, since when does the bitcoin community, a decentralized currency/commodity, care about what a central authority thinks bitcoin should be abbreviated as? 
@_date: 2014-08-30 20:12:09
A small fee. About .5% difference in the exchange rate used to pay dish and what it was when buying back my BTC from circle.
From an earlier comment..


@_date: 2014-03-26 02:42:59
You would still want to report these on your taxes. Assuming the BTC price was constant when you bought the BTC and when you sold/purchased goods with it you would want to deduct any exchange fees paid to acquire the coins 
@_date: 2014-08-30 16:24:12
$3 differences of a $500 bitcoin price is less than 1%. It is a immaterial cost of doing business IMO. I've shopped at many places online where I receive 2-3% discounts for using cash/bitcoin over credit cards. A small price to pay for increased security and the potential for great savings if the retailer is willing to pass on that savings.

Nope its more like a stock. Taxed on the gain after your sell it or use to purchase something. This would require you to track your cost basis of the BTC you own and the market price of the day you sold/bought something

@_date: 2014-03-26 12:58:02
Sorry but I am a CPA. So pretty sure i know more than you...The bitcoin rules are not in the code and are merely the guidance of how the irs will treat bitcoin transactions. That treatment can and will change as time goes on and the bitcoin economy becomes more legitimate in their eyes and as  tax lawsuits are filled against the IRS regarding certain tax treatments. 
And yes, the IRS does care on the dollar amount of return items when it comes to audits. There is a reason why those with higher AGIs get audited more frequently versus those with lower incomes. The tax benefit of having ppl file schedule D's to report what could be thousands of immaterial transactions with marginal gains and loses is most likely less than the administration costs incurred by the IRS. This will become even more apparent over time as the price stabilizes and more ppl adopt its use

Hello, I am a Accountant (CPA) in the states. If your mining coins then you are in a sense manufacturing them like you would any other product. You would then recognize income when you convert them to USD by selling them to some other party either an exchange, individual, or even when you purchase something with the coins at overstock.com. 
You would then be able to deduct all kinds of business expenses, depreciation on your rigs, home office expense if you are dedicating a room to mining, exchange fees, electricity and the list goes on. 
Whats left after all your expenses you would then pay taxes on. What kind of tax would depend on how you set up your mining operation such as either a sole proprietor or a LLC or similar.
@_date: 2014-12-19 17:30:09

I agree with Sterlingz. You should be tracking your basis in USD what your original BTCs were worth. The shares are valued in BTC, which gives you a USD value. If you sell the shares to BTC and then convert to USD. You now have a Capital loss

Trust me. The IRS would rather not sift through all the forms just to find out that someone had a immaterial gain or loss as a result of buying goods or services with bitcoin. They could revise it based on how it is used by the individual. Investor, miner and user of BTC as a currency. 
@_date: 2014-04-02 11:49:08
Really? Tell me how? 
@_date: 2014-03-28 01:34:39
Gladly, The section you refer to is for "informational reporting" which is completely different from the Capital Gains/Loss reporting that individuals will be reporting on their sales of BTC and their purchases of product or service with BTC. 
Informational reporting, If you actually read it, is the requirement to formally provide the IRS and the entity you transacted with information of the dollar value for services/product during the year. This is usually done with a Form 1099. Two copies are made, one goes to the IRS, one goes to the person or business you did the transactions with. This is for informational purposes only and used by the IRS to make sure that individuals are claiming what was reported to them by the other party.
If what I believe you were trying to say with your post is that you won't have to report any transaction under $600 at all, then you are wrong. Yes, you most likely can get away with the 1099 reporting. I would say, for example, that a teenager mowing lawns would not be penalized for not giving the local gas station or repair shop a 1099. However, you will never get away from reporting your own BTC transactions on a Schedule D to calculate your gain or loss on bitcoin transactions.

you are correct, there was no discount from dish for using bitcoin... but at this very moment at newegg.ca you can receive upto $150 off of $500 perchases when using bitcoin. At Amagimetals.com and shinybars.com I can purchase silver and other metals with a 2-3% discount for using bitcoin. Retailers are starting to see the value in using bitcoin and they will make it worth it for customers to use it. 


This is irrelevant when one can spend bitcoin on a purchase and almost in the same instant buy back that same amount for very very little cost.

I think the biggest reason why ppl wouldn't use bitcoin for purchases is because we (as in ppl in the US) are used to a dollar equaling a dollar. For most products the cost of an item was the same as yesterday. 
With bitcoin its a guessing game. I ask myself this every time i buy something with BTC "Should I pay .01 BTC today? Maybe BTC will go up tomorrow and I can pay only .008 BTC?" Also, the problem exists if BTC goes down, as ppl will think "I will just wait for BTC to go back up before buying".
People who get paid in other currencies are more familiar to this problem than Americans are. Unless BTC can remain very very stable for a sustained period it will be hard to justify storing a majority of one's value in it. Let alone using it for day to day purchases.

We are talking about selling mined coins and then re buying and selling again at a later time. This is two taxable events. The first is as business income. Mined coins are essentially your product a miner manufactures. When sold at an exchange you have income. Buying coins back afterwards as an investment is a separate investment activity

What?! Isn't this a huge development if it were true? There is a post office in every medium size town. Every post office currently offers the ability to send money orders to any other post office. Using Bitcoin to provide this service would make it faster and cheaper for the USPS to provide this service. Thousands of people who currently use the services will be using Bitcoin and not even know it.

84 cents for only $10 isn't all that much. If you think about a merchant accepting CCs they can be charged a small flat fee + % of the total transaction. I would guess if you bought more than just $10 you would have paid a lower fee EDIT: on a % basis

Well you can call it a business for tax purposes. Its a hobby if you don't have a net income from it in 3 of 5 years I think tho. So you can definitely do schedule C as a business this year. 
As for expenses you can deduct any reasonable expenses incurred while operating the business. So this would include electricity, hardware, repairs, exchange fees, and if you have your rigs in a dedicated room in your house you can deduct expenses for a home office. There is a simplified method for home office expense this year which should make it easy for you to get the deduction.

First off i am a CPA so i may know something about taxes.... I don't believe the IRS has given guidance relative to bitcoin. Bitcoin could be classified as personal property and not an investment like stock. Your post only applies if the IRS treats bitcoin like a true investment and not just something you own like your car.

Valid points. The IRS will most likely be revising these before the next tax season. It is obvious the guidance was written without much input from the community and without much knowledge of BTC in general.

Sorry, but you or anyone, can route an order to any number of exchanges. What do you think is better, to have .01-.02 cent wide markets and getting filled instantly or 15-25 cent wide markets and getting filled in minutes? Like I said before, technology is a tool available to everyone who is willing to pay to upgrade their crappy legacy systems to get it. 
Further, this whole 60 minute story is complete B.S. Its a story about a guy who wrote a book, a guy who created software to be marketed to big institutions, and an exchange that was created to "solve" the problem of HFT. Don't you get it? its a giant marketing gimmick to sell books, software and get trading business to the new exchange. David Einhorn, who was part of the interview, is an investor in that new exchange! Now whats more rigged? the market or the B.S story meant only to sell products?

So if enforcing this type of tax on Blockchain based exchanges (assuming someday there is a large decentralized exchange based on the Bitcoin Blockchain) would be pretty much impossible. Wouldn't a tax such as this, which is most easily enforced on traditional exchanges and brokerages in the U.S, would encourage individual investors, traders and investment firms to use the decentralized exchange based on the Blockchain?

HAHA I am amazed by the ignorance of this community at times. I am not giving any advice here and only my opinion. If we want Bitcoin to survive and thrive then we should want them to eventually change their opinion on how bitcoin is treated. Again, they have issued Guidance on the treatment of cyrptocurrency transactions. They have not written it into the code. Further, like I said earlier, in many cases the IRS "CODE" is defined by the law suits that will eventually come and this is a good thing.
Yes, there are many individuals that will report very, very large investment gains due to the last bubble. However, as the price stabilizes and more and more ppl adopt it BTC gains will begin to decrease to the point where the average user will not even notice they incurred a gain or a loss. This may take many years though. At that point the IRS will be forced to rethink how they treat it merely because it is not worth their time to review pages upon pages of gain and losses measured in pennies.

By the time we wait for capacity problems to happen it would be to late to implement a solution.

Yes the software would most likely do that but what is the benefit to anyone for having these features? We are destroying the ability to do business without the need to wait for a confirmation. We are making these types of transactions non fungible with the rest of the bitcoins that get sent without these stipulations.
@_date: 2015-09-18 12:13:49
That is true. However, in the case of Bip100 in its current state (or lack of  :p) and with mining likely to become more centralized in the future it would be easy for miners to artificially set the block limit too low. They would likely do this at some point due to the tragedy of the commons. This would lead to off chain solutions to be more popular, like lighting for example (which doesn't exist yet), and would further lead to their fees declining.
 Bip101 on the other hand eliminates all of the above problems for the most part because we all know what the limit will be and can reasonably estimate the fees needed to use the network. Miners would still have a say in what the block size is just like in Bip100 by simply choosing to mine smaller blocks.
@_date: 2015-09-04 02:04:08
To what extent was Blockstream involved in your technical specs?  
@_date: 2015-09-01 14:33:45
Balanced, in that a miner favors a system where other miners can decide how large blocks are? Never mind the fact that by keeping the size low they can potentially increase their transaction fees collected. Sounds like a balanced solution to me /s
@_date: 2015-09-18 01:37:14
While this is true today, if something like bip100 was implemented with miner voting then it would not be true. Miners would almost be equivalent to the Fed as they would be trying to maximize their fees while still making transacting on the network worth doing. Bip101 on the other hand would be more in line with your statement as it is known to all participants what the limit will be at any point in the future.
