Decent, as a certified investor I would add a 6th item to the list
@_date: 2017-12-28 08:09:10
Thanks for your response. I want to buy 5 dollars of Bitcoin first to try it out buying something.

Back in my day, we only had two words Yes and No. Now they have these many words that millenials have made up groestlcoin
@_date: 2017-12-27 03:40:23
If you send them to me I can verify it for Coinbase
@_date: 2017-12-26 04:35:18
Yes but now millenials don't want to work at burger hut so they are shutting it down and replacing it with Dominodonalds
@_date: 2017-12-26 04:46:13
What a perverted depiction of Bitcoin with anthropomorphic roots instead of an invisible ideology, despicable!

Nowadays everything is hard for everyone. My grandson works at Burger Hut 25 hours a day but he never complains. Forks were hard back in my day, things have changed

Dropping Coinbase and Bitpay will only create a highly dangerous and unregulated black market. If Bitpay wants to be implemented on your site, they will find a way.

So how do I get Bitcoin then? I really want to try out this new technology!
@_date: 2017-12-26 04:51:53
Mark this as NSFW please, I don't want my grandson clicking into it without warning.
@_date: 2017-12-27 07:43:12
My grandson copy and pastes other people's work and he could have got in uni if he got in the right time.
Thank you for your support

GOOD point, there is 20% more chance of you winning the lottery with those numbers than random ones according to Abraham Lincoln in 1979

GOOD joke

Spoons have more surface area so they take up more moth ball, so we tend to just rub the forks with it
@_date: 2017-12-26 04:26:40
GOOD point, family reunions have lost it's magic. I remember last time we tried to do a family reunion at pizza hut but they didn't have the fish burgers we wanted so we left.

A bird being the sun means an eternal raging summer with no end, the cock would crow no more. The symbol of an Orwellian dystopia should not be associated with Bitcoin

A great way to teach your kids about Blockchain is to actually use it, I play Blockchain with my grandson using excel and he loves it
@_date: 2017-12-27 03:30:03
I would ask my grandson who works at Coinbase for you

Yes the passphrase can be written in permanent marker. If you want to wash off the permanent marker, my wife used to light it up with a candle before rubbing it off with oil-infused tissues
@_date: 2017-12-27 03:27:13
I would ask my grandson since he works in a Bitcoin ATM
@_date: 2017-12-27 03:44:23
I will send a fax to my grandson right now and ask him

Just delete the mempool so you can free up space

My grandson works as a watch maker and Swiss movements cost a lot more than ones made in Australia. Korean Bitcoins are probably more high quality.

Why do we keep the mempool when we can just delete it? That frees up 300 MB, I believe I just found the scaling solution.

GOOD point, that is inflation I learned it back in 1979 in my post-graduate years of home schooling
