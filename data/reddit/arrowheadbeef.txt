Yes, we are hormone and antibiotic free.  We also **do not** use pesticides on our grasses.
Oh and yes, we can graze year-round in Florida.  Of course, we, like all grass fed beef farms, adhere to a definition of grass that includes the use of hay (harvested grasses).

Hey Y'all,
Still working out some of the kinks but we should be good to go today with new orders on the website. 
If you ordered yesterday and couldn't get your order processed you'll have to place a new order.  Once you do that I'll cancel your first order (they're all just sitting out in e-limbo right now anyway).
And I'm happy to answer any questions about our farm, practices, meat, etc.  Hit me up at info

We only process beef with our cows; in truth, most cows really only **excel** at one or the other (beef or dairy).  If you are in our local area I can recommend a grass fed dairy farm but I'm afraid that's the best I can do.

Happy to share the thunder, there's plenty of grass fed beef to go around!
However, I can't personally recommend any farms on the west coast as I haven't tried anyone's beef from over there, nor have I received feedback about any particular farm. 
I can recommend using eatwild.com to search within a particular area and then reaching out personally to a farm that catches your eye and chatting with them.  Ask about their feeding (&amp; finishing) practices, use of pesticides, hormones and antibiotics and even their type of breed.  Their responses should give you enough insight to pull the trigger on ordering from them or moving on to the next.
Good luck!

2beer - The beef is shipped frozen with dry ice in styrofoam coolers via UPS.  We vacuum seal and flash freeze the beef immediately after butchering (and dry aging), both of which help eliminate any problems associated with frozen beef (loss of texture/tenderness).  Aging removes moisture from beef, which not only makes the meat more tender and flavorful in and of itself, but also when it becomes frozen there is less moisture in the meat to expand (reducing the likelihood of ice crystals "tearing" the meat).  
You will be hard pressed to find fresh grass fed beef that is shipped (US Wellness just started doing this) It's a logistical nightmare for any small farm.  Even with local pickup it's somewhat rare for a small farm to facilitate this given the storage and timing constraints.  
Frozen is just as good as fresh :)

Hey Everyone - 
Just wanted to say thank you for the support and the flood of orders.  As an FYI, we exceed our daily transaction limit with Bitpay and that has caused new orders to be shown a blank screen instead of getting processed.  This is only our first day with Bitpay.
Best thing I can say is to wait until tomorrow to see if the system automatically completes the orders when the limit gets refreshed or if you have to place a new order.  My apologies in advance if you place another order tomorrow and have the same thing happen again.  We are working to get our limit increased; we certainly weren't expecting such a positive response :)
In any case, the cows aren't going anywhere; so, whether we get your order today, tomorrow or the next, I personally will be cutting, packing and shipping all your steaks in a couple of weeks.

No doubt, the UPS rates are murderous as soon as you upgrade from standard Ground (required for CA).  While we try and absorb as much of the cost as possible we're still forced to pass along a big chunk of the shipping to the customer given our size and margins.
Thanks for checking us out and come back any time!
