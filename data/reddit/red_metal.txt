I'm sorry for your hard times, but this isn't the place to be requesting money. its also against the rules of r/bitcoin


@_date: 2014-07-04 02:26:33
Also take into account charge backs from a customer stand point, business's account for this by increasing their end prices, so that everyone ends up paying an extra ~5% or more due to the business loosing both their goods and the money they received for them.
Utilizing bitcoins could easily provide merchants the ability to drop their prices by 5-10%
@_date: 2014-01-17 01:02:53
No this would strenghten bitcoin, using the network helps the network. Transaction fees would help miners survive past the block reward, also not all retailers will "cash" out but the majority will.
@_date: 2014-01-01 04:03:01
Also a far better company than BFL
@_date: 2014-04-23 11:56:42
You have learnt the first rule about mining the hard way, difficulty rises! If you researched anything this wouldn't have happened.
@_date: 2014-02-25 07:09:17
Almost 14.5btc bought at almost a year ago $100 per BTC so not a huge loss, but still hurtful. How can mtgix blame bitcoin when its their own fault this has happened. I hope someone will start up a legal proceeding as they have reaped millions in fees over the years!
@_date: 2017-11-09 23:17:54
Hopefully you get it sorted!
@_date: 2013-09-06 09:55:39
Not sure why that doesn't work. I haven't tried it in a long time. Set up a new acct jcrack_8 :)
@_date: 2013-12-13 01:57:56
1st thing enable 2FA everywhere, second would be to send a small amount between some wallets and get used to transaction fees and how bitcoin moves around. I personally like the idea of Bitcoin stocks have a look into r/bitcoinstocks if this interests you. But the main thing is, keep your money safe.
@_date: 2013-08-19 02:24:57
chuck some numbers in here for a rough estimate, if you find that you will only break even, or have little profit, sell your single.  
@_date: 2013-05-30 04:13:06
You can make a payment without a fee. But it may never reach the intended target. 
At the moment it may take a week or so, but as the reward gets less and less for mining blocks, the miner will only process tranactions that have fees in them
@_date: 2013-06-23 09:58:26
Well said,  has halved in value since this post of yours, and I beleive it will continue to do so until its finally worth something, which would be at roughly 0.0004 per mh/s(for now)
@_date: 2013-07-19 13:06:18
Try btct.co or havelockinvestments. Personally I am invested in a few mining companies like ASICminer and Active mining. Dont waste your time and money on any fixed hash rate funds, the ones that have been operating have only cost the bond holders money.
But the most important thing above all is set up 2FA before you put funds in anywhere.
@_date: 2013-09-03 09:23:10
Thanks for adding sales in BTC, makes it so much easier to use :)
@_date: 2013-06-28 02:30:11
Sell it on ebay. Or bitmit. You should get a fair price for it
@_date: 2013-09-12 23:41:08
Its because more and more people are doing charge backs and paypal disputes. Why ship a lower $ product that takes a little longer to construct than their big miners that are getting charge backs and worth a lot more, more big miners shipped=less money lost.
@_date: 2013-08-21 02:23:21
Lots of people will sell when it's the right time for them, I'll hold most of mine probably until the end of time! I've invested what I want and I don't think I will ever convert more $ into BTC.
@_date: 2013-06-28 02:35:56
That doesn't matter as long as you specify that you don't currently have it. If your willing to use an escrow service you will probably get a higher price. Look on bitcoin talk
@_date: 2013-12-19 01:08:58
Seriously why didn't you have auto payouts enabled? also my balance is showing 150BTC when I know I cashed everything out and moved a long time ago.
@_date: 2013-12-13 00:33:30
Explain the benefits of bitcoin as a payment system rather than a currency. Explain to him confirmation times 24/7 and the low almist zero cost of these transactions. 
@_date: 2013-05-22 21:07:29
go to havelockinvestment.com
@_date: 2013-05-21 12:33:27
They changed this a little while ago, I think its to stop some of the clogging up on their system.
@_date: 2013-12-19 01:10:08
They got hacked a while ago, most other people haven't legitimately mined their coins and unfortunately you proably won't get a payout.
@_date: 2013-08-19 21:24:52
Looking good, user name redmetal.
Id like to see some default bid buttons, ie bid 0.01 0.1 &amp; 1 something like that :)
@_date: 2013-09-16 08:27:11
Website like ebay Bitmit.net or r/bitmarket
@_date: 2013-11-26 23:03:37
First off they won't ship this month, however I personally believe they are not a scam as they are under nda with easic that is producing their 28nm chip. Easic is a better known company and they have news articles relating to their arrangements with vmc. Do a little research on the subject, I believe vmc will deliver but when is the question.

Interesting, I haven't heard anything about Coinjar.io being a scam. In fact I have used their service on several ocassions, for numerous amounts, and have yet to feel the "scam" also when their bank accounts got locked up they still honored the purchases, and when they had issues they compensated people (myself included) in my eyes Coinjar.io is 100% reliable. 
@_date: 2013-06-15 13:54:19
Simple, easy and fun

Looks like you have hit 500k. When will the winner be credited? :)
@_date: 2013-11-04 05:40:44
Its boarderline. Use mining.thegenesisblock.com and put some figures in that.
If the value of btc drops then you will be at a loss. If it rises you would have been better off just buying coins.
@_date: 2013-09-08 03:30:31
Unfortunately 10ghs asicminer blades sell for 4btc, I would make an offer if I was willing to risk the funds on it, but the rate of difficulty rises(and uncertainty in bitcoin mining) I couldn't make money even at 2btc.
Try selling it on ebay, you can still make a bit of money there. Best of luck.
@_date: 2013-09-19 07:23:49
It will never be this low again. Unless bitcoin becomes worthless
@_date: 2013-05-01 11:17:53
best place to buy would be bitinnovate.com. i have used them to buy and sell
@_date: 2013-08-20 12:27:32
Your Nationality would help answer the question. 
@_date: 2013-05-23 07:13:41
thats alotta coin.....
@_date: 2013-12-02 02:22:05
Too true. But setting it up as a default for new accounts would be a great idea, have it on a 6 hour default. Easily changed for the experienced, and a saftey net for the inexperienced. 
@_date: 2013-06-16 23:02:52
Btc quick would be your best option. Fees are reasonable 7.5% and its quick once you verify your account
@_date: 2013-06-21 01:02:01
Thqnks guys :)
@_date: 2013-12-12 08:05:34
This group is running ~120TH of mining power and I doubt they would have spent anywhere near $20mil for this nice little pot
@_date: 2013-10-25 09:51:14
How have you amassed all of your coins? Buying, trading or mining?
@_date: 2013-10-04 06:27:26
Use the new version by Lifeboat  is upto 4x faster than the original, and has GL 64bit versions and is more compatiable with recent cards both AMD and Nvidia.
@_date: 2013-06-28 20:32:55
Thanks :)
@_date: 2013-10-04 00:06:06
This should have been done along time ago. There has always been discussion for him to update, he just never took the time to do so.
@_date: 2013-07-01 05:41:05
You would make more setting up a PMB like BFmines and tatvm.
@_date: 2013-07-05 00:52:15
Last I heard they where having issues meetijg demand. They will deliver they just have to source the BTC. At the moment they are in tye final stages of being verified with multiple exchanges
@_date: 2013-11-03 00:53:52
Not many people are as lucky as you have become. If your feeling generous think about donating a little bit, maybe to a place like sean's outpost
@_date: 2013-12-12 02:15:08
Adjustments happen every 10days, and 30% is likely consider this; BFL will have hardware and you are very late to the 28nm queue. 
VM are unleashing 28th machines in january/feb
Black arrow, coin terra, KNC for their second round of hardware, BITFury, then ASISMiner are releasing their 3rd gen chips Jan/Feb
There are others as well and one of these companies (KNC) will tripple the currently difficulty on their own, think about how much power these guys will bring to the table.
A better calc is 
@_date: 2013-10-26 11:22:03
You also better off just giving that money away. At least you would get something out of it
@_date: 2013-06-16 23:00:36
Thats not the point. People love asicminer shares as they hold their value over time, and may even increase.  Tat virtualmine has little to no resale value over the long term and so do the usb miners. These things will probably never achieve ROI.
@_date: 2013-08-24 00:04:24

@_date: 2013-09-22 08:51:31
How recently was the refund? They will contest the refund if you accept it. Mark my words DO NOT sign for the package
@_date: 2013-05-29 10:37:48
I only have one question. How? Personal opinion, I think you should hold them for as long as you can, And see if they take off as much as some people think they will
@_date: 2013-07-30 11:21:47
Exactly! Or any form of currency\shares or investments for that matter.

Use Coinjar.io best fees around
@_date: 2013-12-22 07:35:33
Guessing. I would say one of the old exchanges addresses
@_date: 2013-06-14 07:58:33
Buy from havelock investments still at 0.027
@_date: 2013-05-23 00:51:41
Go to havelockinvestments that sell part shares in ASICminer and pay out dividends weekly
@_date: 2013-12-17 23:25:01
Not entirely true. Its the merchant that pays for your "rewards" through tranactions fees. Merchants that use bitcoin suffer zero charge backs and zero fees, as the consumer will pay the tiny tranaction fee, they can then easily offer 5-10% discount on their goods.
@_date: 2013-10-07 01:08:12
Several months ago a few people got non paypal/credit card refunds, they may grant you a refund on compassionate grounds if you can prove it, apart from that legal action would be your best bet. But personally I see that you want get your money back, and if you took legal action you won't get your miner either, best of luck. 
@_date: 2013-06-04 01:04:02

Btcquick.com great service I have used them several times
@_date: 2013-08-13 07:23:31
Sure, but we don't know how secure these are, and their also not producing much if anything at the moment. There are also group buys on bitcointalk.org these offer the best value, but no one apart from ASICminer can deliver any hardware right now.
@_date: 2013-07-01 06:59:59
Its where you sell mh/s for a price. Currently people are selling one mh/s for ~0.004 btc or at least trying to, Just look on bitfunder.com or btct.co
@_date: 2013-11-27 10:37:46
@_date: 2013-05-23 05:34:38
@_date: 2013-10-05 01:19:22
There are instructions to transfer them to bitfunder or havelockinvestments. Talk to tat email him on tat.investments if I remember correctly you just need to push your am shares to TATInvestments on btct then email tat and let him know your bitfunder user name or send the email from your havelock associated email address
@_date: 2013-12-09 19:26:39
Great idea. It looks like they have all been solved
@_date: 2013-07-30 06:44:21
Similar story. I bought in on the way up at ~170. But have been able to make some gains trading them.
@_date: 2013-09-17 02:27:37
Zero! funds hold a value in bitcoin, but do not take bitcoins away from the total pool, of the 11.5 million in circulation Zero are "held" within these stocks.
If these stocks fail then they will be worth Zero bitcoins.
As for how much would all the stocks be worth if they where sold now, this ones harder to explain. Look at AM market cap of 800,000 Bitcoins, it was at one point worth 2million bitcoins but you would never be able to convert all of these into bitcoins as they are only worth what someone is willing to pay. at its peak it was worth a whopping 18% of the total bitcoin market cap.
@_date: 2013-10-02 06:08:57
A question everyone should ask when contemplating this is, why would anyone sell something that they could make more on by using themselves?
@_date: 2013-07-30 11:24:50
Indeed never risk more than your willing to lose! there are alot of worthless funds that will probably lose you money so make sure to research everything. 
@_date: 2013-07-08 08:22:55
Any chance you guys will be adding 2FA at some point?
@_date: 2013-11-27 19:36:27
If your feeling generous would you think about a small donation to seansoutpost.com?
@_date: 2013-12-12 02:24:50
Best of luck with it all, I was lucky enough to have gotten a credit card refund when I purchased my BFL gear in January, as this gear would never have ROI for me. At the time of buying I thought sweet ill make 12k in a year if they where delayed and took 3 months to ship my gear (even thoe at the time they stated it would only take 1 month from time of ordering) 
@_date: 2013-09-18 07:03:14
Unfortunately you may never break even buying one of these. Its too risky right now to buy anything mining related
@_date: 2013-11-17 20:01:22
Fiat profit sure. But if you paid in BTC you will never gain that BTC back, and after all thats what they where selling
@_date: 2013-10-04 14:39:31
It tends to be the drivers that cause issues if your using catalyst 13. Try 12 or 11
@_date: 2013-12-12 01:49:49
Thats why you join a competent diversified group buy. Look at BFL's history. You be lucky to start hashing before June, the same old question applies why on earth would BFL sell you something that they could make more money on using? They will use your bought hashes until they are becoming worthless.
@_date: 2013-05-21 12:30:34
Signed up. Your website looks good, are you thinking of making an app?
@_date: 2013-05-23 07:25:38
Very very nice. Might need your services in a few months :)
@_date: 2013-07-24 10:00:14
No one can tell you how to invest. But stay away from shitty mining contracts, the worse ones are things like BFmines
@_date: 2013-08-13 06:04:54
I wont go into too much detail. Gpu mining is dead unless you already have the hardware and really cheap power. BFL is classified as ASIC, but don't buy from them, the people who ordered 12mths ago are just getting their hardware now. 
And Stay away from overpriced mining contracts.
A quick comparison; 
ATI 6770 $100 - 200mh
BFL jap $450 - 5000mhs
KNC Jupiter $7000 - 400,000mhs
Contracts such as tatvm 0.001BTC($.1) provides 1mh.
Go to  and do some calcs
@_date: 2013-12-13 02:03:43
Sure consumer side its cheap using Fiat. Think about the merchant cost's, even in acepting cash the costs are high, transportation, bank fees, insurances, charge backs, Business's account for stolen goods, damaged goods and charge backs in their profit forcasts. With all this a business essientially can charge a lower amount due to the risks being less, they can also set up an automatic transfer from BTC directly into thier bank accounts to lessen the risk of BTC price changes.
@_date: 2013-07-11 03:45:46
Dont buy the full ASICminer shares on havelock just yet, they have been bumped up in price compared with bitfunder or btct your better off buying them from their and transferring them for free across to havelock. 
As for your question it really depends on what you are after, constant dividends with comparatively little price movements go for asicminer, if your after a bit more risk and potential growth try activemining or basic. But remember nothings garurenteed. 
@_date: 2013-10-07 00:01:54
They won't refund you anything, even if they granted a refund in BTC it would only be at todays value.
@_date: 2013-10-20 00:10:58
The biggest reason is that no matter what only 21 million bitcoins will ever be available. Simply put, the more people mining the lesser share of the pie they will have.
