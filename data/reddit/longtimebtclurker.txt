But didn't OKCoin fake most of their Litecoin volume?

This is why I am confused.
Isn't selling shares on havelock the same as ''transferring'' them? (From the previous owner, to a new owner)? 
Or are there different fees for ''selling'' and ''transferring'' (transferring your shares to a different account, meaning: not getting bitcoins/fiat in return).

Thank you for your quick reply.
I've had enough of the LTC trading, it is literally making me feel sick, it's so heavily manipulated that I can throw up, lol :P.
I want to move my funds on BTC-e (not only because I want to stop trading Litecoins/Bitcoins, but also because I don't really trust BTC-e), and purchase Neo &amp; Bee shares. I want to have some flexibility, so I'll choose Havelock instead of LMB-holdings. 
Do you know anything about the safety of Havelock? Do they offer 2FA protection, and are they easy with bitcoin withdrawals?

Thank you for your quick reply.
Can one speculate about Neo &amp; Bee shares somewhere on Reddit? 
Do people expect that Neo &amp; Bee will become one of the most successful bitcoin businesses, and if yes, how do you think this will affect N&amp;B share prices? :)

Oh you! Don't be so shy! 
I have hired 10,000 Chinese workers, they'll soon create 10 Reddit accounts each and upvote your post!
Do you have a few hours? I'll try to get a $100K loan so I can tip the shit out of your totally-not-asking-for-attention-and-money post!

What do you mean, I was planning on buying 4000 shares, but now I won't...
