I like the minimal layout! Super clean interface and intuitive enough.  Uploading a bunch of songs was painless.  Got my tunes up here, mostly chilled / jazzy beat stuff:
I hope this catches on!

This is a cute point that keeps getting repeated, but bitcoin is just in its infancy.  Cash and gold don't have built in protections either and it'll take time for the bitcoin escrow/credit/consumer protected services to come online.
I got a significant refund from Paypal and am really glad I used them! But if you paid with bitcoin or cash via bank transfer you're equally screwed, so it wasn't just bitcoin buyers.

I hit that as well on Thursday, one of my 2 BTC orders was cancelled and I got the e-mail about fraud / high risk accounts.  I'm a much newer user so figured it was the way they work.  Their two factor auth also stopped working for me yesterday.  Bugs are my guess, I'm sure they're aware and trying to fix it.

Right, as was stated by OP in his analysis.

I was of the opinion that my 2 jalapenos pre-ordered in April would be worthless.  I think you should absolutely try to get a refund.  Read this thread and send a message to lajz99, it worked for me (and very quickly I might add):
If you are stuck waiting for your account to get out of newbie jail or whatever then just send me a PM and I'll help you out.

The point isn't so much how many decimal places, it's fitting a $1 trillion market cap in 21 million coins.
