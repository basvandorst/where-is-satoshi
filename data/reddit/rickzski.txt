And if that happens, I'll throw the kitchen sink at it!

Amazingly uneducated perspective.  Regan cut taxes more than any president in history and the result was an economic boon so great that the revenue to the govt DOUBLED. Before posting FUD like this, a little homework seems in order.

You can see an $18k sell wall on GDAX right now.

Oh yes, let's all get our news from the leftist CNBC fake news outlet. Zero proof from the "Joint Committee on Taxation", of course.  Just more FUD, as usual. Same crap with CNN, WaPo, Times, etc.  Pushing their agenda at the expense of the citizens, as usual. Sad that anyone actually falls for this crap.

At 7:53 PM EST tonight. Make sure to throw the kitchen sink at it!
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:02:16
how did you do that?
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:23:48
Buy. You’ll regret it
@_date: 2017-12-08 13:22:48
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:57:42
No problem.  It takes me literally 1 second to hit the "undo" button to change it back.
@_date: 2017-12-02 13:02:12
Bump. Anyone?
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:31:39
I’m sure hoping so. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:49:58
I just changed it again.  I can do this all day every day if they want to play this childish game.  The truth is important.
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:51:06
Schoolish is right.
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:56:24
The second comment you received was from a user named Schoolish.  In a nutshell, he stated that if you bought bitcoin from Coinbase by selecting the bank EFT option, they will honor the price today that you placed the order.  However, if you simply transferred money to Coinbase from your bank, then you will need to wait about 5 days until the transfer goes through before you can spend it.  You should also know that Coinbase allows instant coin purchase with a debit card.
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:35:07
16-1/2 days.
@_date: 2017-12-25 20:18:12
So is he gay, then?
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:59:28
No reason really.  Maybe it could be 3 or 4K.  It's the idea of preventing large losses that I'm interested in.  
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:31:13
Thanks for the meaningful response.  Not always the case on this forum.  What would be great is for someone to develop a chart that takes the daily increase or decrease required to get to the listed futures price, and then computes the sentiment for the accuracy of the current price.
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:21:01
@_date: 2017-11-17 15:34:48
Please point out exactly where he asked what he should do with it.
@_date: 2017-11-20 17:05:34
Here are 10:
@_date: 2017-11-17 13:47:44
1. He didn't get it for free.  2. Who are you to tell anyone when/why/how they can sell THEIR assets?  SMH
@_date: 2017-11-16 23:06:19
Thanks for posting.  I just deleted Changilly from the companies I do crypto business with.  Appreciate you making this public so others can avoid them too.
@_date: 2017-11-17 15:57:47
He was NOT literally asking.  He was making a point. Fuck sake...
@_date: 2017-11-20 11:25:08
As expected, post tagged as misleading.  Please do explain how this is misleading?  Are the mods NOT doing this?
@_date: 2017-11-19 15:24:40
Yes, you really need to say it. I  don't get it.
@_date: 2017-11-15 11:24:26
Ridiculous. This is about BTC. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 10:53:17
Not making the connection.
@_date: 2017-11-12 14:37:57
We can make almost as much as the richest elite of BTC.  Just need to HODL.
@_date: 2017-11-14 20:52:12
Nope.  I've tried everything I can think of too.  Disappointing.
@_date: 2017-11-17 12:51:29
So because BCH is a shitcoin, you think he should hold it?  Makes no sense.
@_date: 2017-11-17 16:33:04
So mature.
@_date: 2017-11-10 17:04:51
Damn right!  Good for you, dude.  LETS GO!  
@_date: 2017-11-19 15:22:10
That equates to ~ $0.16cents(USD)/Kwh.  That's much more expensive than most places in the U.S.
@_date: 2017-11-19 15:23:21
And it's been there for 36 hours now...
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:32:49
@_date: 2017-11-15 04:39:09
You do a lot of guessing for someone that has zero understanding. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 04:18:59
Better than unintelligible question about fees
@_date: 2017-11-12 18:17:42
That's why only the smartest investors HODL! :-)
@_date: 2017-11-18 12:59:48
Lighten up.  It's funny.
@_date: 2017-11-21 13:11:38
I like coin mastery the best. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 19:06:16
I just looked at the historicals on tradingveiw for the past 5 years.  There is no correlation I can see with a bump during the holiday season.  In fact, In 2014, 2015 and 2016, the opposite happened.  2016 however, did experience a bump.
