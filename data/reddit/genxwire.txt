I'm pretty sure these "Bank Miners" would be hacked along with the network lol.

yes, I did a bunch of investigation on Ashley Barr when Mark was fingered as DPR by the defense... a few columns, almost word for word what I had posted about.  I was cited as "redditors".

Man if you you had an escrow service with a rating system, that would enable all sorts of cool things.

Bitcoin is now too big to fail :)
Coming from Citi, this is rich.  We should have let them all go bankrupt and infused all that cash to the middle class.
@_date: 2015-01-27 16:21:11
this is what scares me.... "tumble" they say.  yeah because that will be legal forever and the NSA and IRS won't use those as honey pots.

You know the whole point of Terrorism... is to create FEAR and TERROR.
United States Government does the job for them, to steal our Liberty.
Green terrorist alert today, maybe I can have a few drinks and sleep tonight.

OP just figured out why an ex Goldman Sachs employee left Goldman Sachs to launch Coinbase.

I hope new york gets left out in the cold due to overregulation

or get free money from US citizens in the form of a "refund" if you don't make a lot of $?

Get a reciept... problem solved.  Next?

ignorant is ignorant.  Thomas Jefferson thinks there is a problem that needs solving, so does Ron Paul.  In fact, most people do once they LEARN about the problem that needs solving.

I quit reading after "Greece and Finance" were used in the same sentence.
@_date: 2015-01-27 16:10:37
Just wait till the IRS gets a hold of this, all you people preaching about how privacy doesn't matter.  You just thought doing taxes now was crazy... wait till they can track EVERY transaction to the involved parties, and they make tumbling illegal in most of the world and use the others for honeypots.
@_date: 2015-01-27 20:35:03
Conbase is hostile to privacy and lies to promote.  The Goldman Sachs worker that founded Conbase did not fall far from the tree.  Having said that... Cali can't regulate, what Cali hasn't decided to regulate... Warren G. just popped in my head.

"Most People" are slaves to the 0.1% including the Fed through financial warfare...
I would argue you are wrong.  Let the 0.1% choke on their paper, while real people use what is best for US and not THEM.

Thanks guys, going to try Libertyx :)
Circle froze my account, and I'm done dealing with banks and KYC hoops.  I don't need all these companies with my personal info and selfies just to buy some coin with MY money.

or quasi governmental, it has nothing to do with uncle sam.
@_date: 2015-02-04 01:31:45
Classy = not following coins after multiple hops to mine info from users.  Coinbase is far from classy.

Will be &gt; 25, he will be an old man if it is not a life sentence.
@_date: 2015-02-03 21:59:38
so he doesn't accept visa or mastercard either?
@_date: 2015-02-03 20:50:15
you realize banks crumbled in 2008 right?  we (the taxpayers) kind of bailed them out, while the fed robbed us via printing, and all that benefited the government because they were able to sell bonds with laughable interest.  all but the 0000.1% got it with no lube.
banks actually have a long storied history of failure and insolvency.

Can you update your Privacy Policy while your at it... worse than Facebook and Google.

The trial involved no murder for hire charges.
@_date: 2015-02-04 18:49:37
Dude it will get your account shut down, I promise.
@_date: 2015-02-03 18:59:01
so true.
@_date: 2015-02-06 20:31:16
what rules?  There are no laws anywhere stating Coinbase needs to follow multiple hops on a single transaction, but they do anyway.  That is all anyone needs to know about how Coinbase values the consumer.
@_date: 2015-02-06 16:00:29
Do yourself a favor and pull up a 50 year chart of gold.
@_date: 2015-02-04 18:48:40
Coinbase shut down accounts for purchasing seeds in legal states, citing federal regulations.  It will get your Coinbase account shut down, no cash in or out.  Quite frankly Coinbase is hostile to privacy.

yeah non of them accept Mastercard, Visa or Amex either...
@_date: 2015-02-04 18:54:29
I don't know. But they do and its not fullproof, they err on the side of covering their own ass, looking and guessing at things they are not even legally required to do.  Coinbase's primary income will be selling transaction info... You heard it here first.
@_date: 2015-02-06 20:27:05
Coinbase sucks.  I'll keep saying it.  They are hostile to the consumers of their service and have worse privacy practices than google.
@_date: 2015-02-06 20:34:28
Lol, I'm sure the IRS will love people like you, and I'm sure you have violated so many obscure tax laws involving cash it isnt even funny.  Nothing matters until it does.  Privacy is kind of a big deal unless you are a fan of a surveillance state., in which case i refer you to a book called "1984".
@_date: 2015-02-06 22:17:17
You just touched on the crux of the problem with banks in general.  The fed and the banks are private businesses that answer to no one, except an occasional appearance in front of congress where the chairman states how they have met the mandates, even though real inflation has seen the price of milk, gas, a McDonalds  healthcare, education all more than double in cost the last 10 years.

for life when your in your early 20's? ... like what?  Don't start talking white collar crime, before you tell me why it's ok no banker went to jail in 2008.
@_date: 2015-02-04 18:52:39
They data mine the blockchain and transactions and make educated guestimates and err on the side of shutting down your cash in and out feature of your Coinbase account, each and every time.  Coinbase is hostile to consumer privacy, its like a banker following you around seeing where you spend your cash, and then follow the cash from the store to see where the store spends those bills you gave them. 
@_date: 2015-02-03 20:58:42
no one gets a fair investigation with millions on the line... welcome to the police state.  Notice "investigation" not "trial".

You are asking the right question my friend.  He is an agent, and doesn't really exist.  Everything online of his was frozen once Ross was arrested.  You would figure he would make a prime witness, but he vanished... what is interesting is HE LIVED IN WHITEROCK!!!!
