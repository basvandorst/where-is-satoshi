Bitcoin isn't a virtual currency.  It's a real currency.   Linden dollars are virtual.  
The answer is No.  
Either that or simply don't fill in anything.  I plead the fifth.

Amp is the real big deal.  With that, I can use a lot of small channels to send and receive larger payments.  This really opens things up.  I can also grow my lightning footprint over time which increases usefulness.  No need to open one large channel to accomplish the same thing.

..but they are losing trust.  In many nations, their money is extremely unstable and losing value constantly.  Bitcoin loses value but then retraces.  It's happened many times now and as it continues to happen, people will stop having the crisis in confidence that drives these cycles.  
  
Time is on bitcoin's side.  The longer it's around, the more faith people develop in it.

I think the seed phrases would look cooler on paper.  I still have no idea how to create a cool piece of paper I could give my friends with them and how to send it to an address.  I can't send bitcoin to some words.  
If I'm this way, I know others are.  Why can't there be a website that does this--even if you download it first to your computer?  Whole cryptocurrencies are written in javascript.  It's no longer acceptable or accurate to say javascript is weak.

What do you propose to replace this with since this will clearly slow the adoption of bitcoin.   If you don't want people to gift others with paper wallets, what should they do instead.  
You should never just take something away that works to spread adoption without replacing it with something equally as effective.

Out of curiosity, why are all of your posts about crypto going down?   Also, why are there just so many?  
I couldn't imagine spending that much of my time in subs telling people crypto is over unless it was my job.   You are a passionate person.

It locks up bitcoin on the RSK sidechain thus making them even more rare.

In truth, the only people I know personally that have faith in fiat are boomers and retirees on pensions.  Most I talk to know it's a scam.

It would have been a smart thing in the past.

If the inputs are unknown, your currency is a scam.  The inputs are fully known in bitcoin.  How about the US dollar?  How much longer do you believe people will have faith in any currency where some group at the top can create as much as they like, give it to whoever they like and no one can tell?   
There is no meaningful audit of the fed and all numbers they provide are in terms of dollars allocated in broad areas.  We don't even know if they are lying or not.  If the inputs are unknown, your currency is a scam.

...and there you have what's happening.  Thanks for proving they are right despite the misrepresentation of yourself.

I'd like to see proof that you run a large otc desk.  Until then, I call bullshit.   So sick of people saying, I do this and here's my opinion without providing proof.

You can open a ton of 20 dollar channels over time and still be able to move 1000s of dollars at a time instead of opening up a 1000 dollar channel.

...so where are they?  Where and how do we generate these seed phrases.  Where is the long article on how to do it safely and how to send bitcoin to it and how to give it to your friends.  
You've written this exhaustive diatribe attempting to stop cold one of the best ways in expanding bitcoin.  Do you feel no responsibility in replacing it?  Why not show us all that you truly have good motives and push just as hard for a good replacement.  
I have no idea how it can be "replaced by seed phrases".  How do I do this?  How can I continue to help spread bitcoin awareness since you want to take away my primary tool?
