Right now bitcoin, along with all all the altcoins, is charting the cryptocurrency waters. Talking about some kind of end goal is a bit premature at this point.
That being said I believe bitcoin will end up filling the greatest demands with altcoins filling the gaps.
@_date: 2015-12-29 18:39:18


The absolute answer your question is no. There is no other technology besides cryptocurrencies which **only** allow the "owner" of certain records to change those records. This is what's referred to as "decentrailized authority" and it is the core innovation of all cryptocurrencies. Everything else, smart contracts, distributed ledgers etc already existed but it is all based on centralized authority systems meaning that anyone with DBA access can manipulate any and all records as well as shut down access for legitimate owners.

Your comment is a good one but I don't see how it demonstrates that there is a significant benefit to an intricate knowledge of the codebase when discussing the blocksize increase.

Until we figure out a way that people can dedicate their lives to writing stories without needing to pay for food, rent... living this is going to be a problem.
With bitcoin it allows the funding to come from many different sources so there's no single influence. That's much better than the modern media system we have today. Most news stations are owned by the same company.
@_date: 2015-06-09 04:13:43
I haven't seen this being discussed for a while but I thought it was well understood that the nodes will have to be incentivized somehow. (Off topic: Regardless of block size.)
@_date: 2015-12-14 04:01:11
Your negative attitude is counter productive and being vague just makes it easy to peg you as an anarchy advocate. Clearly you have a problem with the way things work. Have the maturity to be specific about what's wrong and explain how it should be. Otherwise you're just harming this community.
@_date: 2015-12-17 10:07:52
I'm not entirely sure but I think what you're saying is that he meant that it is criminal and there's no reason to backpedal.
The media has been painting the bitcoin community as a bunch of criminals for a while now and we're happy to write them off because it's an oversimplification of what's happening.
... but as soon as I say the same thing about Jeff Garzik suddenly it's worthy of downvotes? Get over yourselves.
Look the fact is that if a decentralized system is so fragile that a handful of developers working hard to continue adding features and changes to the platform are criminals for not incorporating the changes that others in the community want to see is "criminal" this whole decentralized idea is already doomed. Maybe not today or tomorrow but overall it's doomed. Decentralization doesn't work the moment you start throwing terms like "criminal" around with regards to it's development. In order for something to be criminal it means that the decentralized nature of Bitcoin is not enough to protect the system and requires a third party to make assessments on it's behavior. If you agree with Jeff Garzik's assessment then Bitcoin has already failed.

LocalBitcoins simply serves to hold the coins you wish to sell in escrow so the buyer knows you actually have them. Once that's confirmed they wire you fiat using a method which is completely unconnected to LocalBitcoins. Once you confirm the transfer to your bank account you return to LocalBitcoins and release the bitcoins to the buyer. I'm not sure how dispute resolution works.
So really the question is, what will your German bank account do when a bunch of random people begin depositing money in your account for unclear reasons?

And you've now implemented a more robust backup plan?
@_date: 2015-06-11 19:39:08
This behavior isn't defined by the protocol so the real reason could only be given by the miners themselves. However if we were to speculate, there's no good reason to let all the mining equipment sit idle while they all wait for transactions to propagate. Might as well try some hashes on some empty blocks during this time, they could get lucky and sometimes they do.
@_date: 2015-06-10 22:26:13
I thought it was pretty well understood we need to incentivize the nodes. To expect them to be run off of indirect benefit / altruism forever is silly. We don't expect that of the miners, why should nodes be any different?
@_date: 2015-06-24 05:53:49
@_date: 2015-06-09 03:50:07
The full node argument is coming from the wrong angle. Regardless of block size full nodes are going to need to be incentivized somehow. They can't rely on altruism forever. 
@_date: 2015-06-10 23:31:36
The latter. If a mining pool with 20% of the hash rate limits their blocks to 1mb the effective limit becomes 16.2mb

Non-miner here: I run two nodes.
@_date: 2015-06-16 17:12:10
The first bitcoin block was mined ~2009/01/03 or ~3,391,200 minutes ago.
Current block height (number of blocks mined) is 361,201.
3,391,200 / 361,201 = 9.39 minutes
Average block time is controlled by adjusting the target, that is, the number of possible solutions to a block. The higher the combined hash rate of the network, the lower the number of possible solutions is allowed.
@_date: 2015-06-04 15:11:30
Yes. Much like the lack of cold fusion reactors.
@_date: 2015-12-29 18:50:11
It can be designed to do all of that but at the end of the day it's still a centralized authority system. Cryptocurrencies are decentralized authority systems.

I think he's trying downplaying this a bit. There isn't necessarily anything wrong with an inflationary model. I don't think the deflationary model is a necessity for a cryptocurrency to succeed.

No offense but when you say this it makes your whole comment seem like a non-answer.
From my perspective the discussion about the size increase has primarily been focused on economic concerns. We're pretty far into uncharted territory here and so in that regard the devs are speculating just as much as anybody.

Of course if all the miners stopped processing transactions it would mean:
1. The price would crash.
2. They would only be able to transfer their bitcoins using blocks they mine.
So there is some self interest, it's just not immediately realized.

Maybe, but probably not. When people get so invested into a method of solving a problem they develop blind spots due to making basic assumptions for so long.

"Contentious hardfork" is a misnomer. They're just forks. If the bitcoin community is comprised of two incompatible species of users a fork is the best course of action for everybody. There's nothing wrong with two cryptocurrencies emerging out of the bitcoin code.
At the end of the day you have the power to go out and buy a miner, run a node or create an exchange and pick which fork you support.
And before someone tells me that this will slow down mainstream adoption to that I say, good! Cryptocurrencies are still new, if more time is needed to develop the tech before the average user comes onboard then so be it. I'm as excited about getting to the moon as the next guy but I'd prefer to do it the right way.

What aspects of the block size debate would significantly benefit from an intricate knowledge of the codebase?
@_date: 2015-06-09 20:28:02


Prior to all of this block resizing debate there were numerous discussions that pointed out nodes will have to be incentivized eventually. Do you feel that nodes will never have to be incentivized if the limit remains at 1mb?
In addition to that, as has been stated in a number of these arguments, the miners themselves can keep whatever soft limit they like. If a pool with 33% of the hashing power decides to keep a soft limit of 1mb that will effectively make the average block size 13.53mb even if every other miner maxes out blocks at 20mb. The miners have adjusted their behavior in the past when it affected the price. Why don't you have any confidence they would do the same in this case?
@_date: 2015-06-11 20:23:25
Yes it does. It means they were lucky enough to solve a block before any transactions have propagated.
@_date: 2015-06-09 04:49:45
I don't disagree that learning the code is important. But that's not the question I originally asked which you replied to. 


I'm not trying to be rude but if you can't give an answer with something substantial what value do you think you're adding to the conversation?
@_date: 2015-12-13 21:51:37

Nothing about your tone or comments indicates you're interested in understanding my perspective. You're just saying "it doesn't make sense" over and over. You've already made your judgement and every time I respond you get more aggressive. That's trollish behavior. If you were interested you'd use language like "i don't understand how". See the difference?
@_date: 2015-06-22 17:11:12
The only redeeming quality about this article is that the author intentionally shows his bias. Other than that it's a lot of speculation he's trying to pass off as fact.
The fact is we don't actually know what would happen if we raise the block size to 20mb. We don't even know what's going to happen to bitcoin if nothing changes. I didn't know a stress test could stall my node.
Anyone who writes as if they *know* what's going to happen should be written off immediately and given no more consideration. The temptation to follow a leader is understandable but I didn't get into bitcoin because I wanted a leader. We have that already and I hate it. I wanted a system that could handle change. In order to do that we have to maintain the attitude that each and every one of us should do our own research, stick with the facts and come to our own conclusions. 
This is the only way to guarantee a system remains decentralized and the best hope for it's survival.
@_date: 2015-06-24 20:14:41

@_date: 2015-12-29 18:48:03
You can find an endless number of people who believe something true but fail miserably at reasoning why. Distributed ledgers/databases etc. bring nothing new to the table for the tech industry. We've been aware of the possibilities for years. The fact that banks are getting excited about this only demonstrates just how far behind in tech they are.
The core innovation of all cryptocurrencies is "decentralized authority". Everything else whether it's smart contracts, distributed ledgers etc already existed but all these systems ran on a centralized authority. Meaning as a DBA I can manipulate any records I please regardless of who is the legitimate owner.
@_date: 2015-06-11 22:44:00
Oh I see what you're saying. I was assuming the &lt;1min block is mined by the same miner that mines the previous block. In which case propagation of new transactions would take time.
But you're talking about when the prior block from the &lt;1min block is mined by a different miner. And yes in that case I can see how trying to mine an empty block until they know which transactions to exclude would make sense.
Thanks for clarifying.

I would suggest you add some explanation about how the miners are capable of enforcing an individual limit for their block sizes as this would relate to point A and E. 
@_date: 2015-06-16 00:07:39
Not really. People can huff and puff all they like. At the end of the day the only thing that matters is which chain the miners/nodes/exchanges pick. Once a date is set it's going to take no more than an hour to see a clear winner and we'll all move along.
@_date: 2015-06-08 02:13:14
The truth is everybody is speculating. Nobody knows for sure, not even the devs. This isn't a technological question. It's a political one.
All we can do is stick with what we know. And we know the chain is secured by the hashing power of the network. If the exchanges try to stick with a chain that only has about 10% of the hashing power it would be really easy for some small fraction of the miners on the 90% chain to hop over for a few hours and wreak some havoc.
Of course the miners would rather not deal with any disagreements as it's sure to have a negative impact on the bitcoin price. So if all the exchanges give public support to a specific chain it could influence a significant number of miners to go with that chain.
Only thing that's for certain, it's going to be interesting. :)

From my understanding a lack of nodes can destabilize the network.
@_date: 2015-05-27 17:37:49
To be technically correct what you mean is if it does happen it will be temporary because miners will abandon one chain for the other.
But a complication arises the closer we get to 50/50. Miners don't know if they should jump or wait for the rest of the miners to jump on theirs. Some decide to stick with their chain, some jump. So how long does this jumping and sticking happen until a clear winner comes out?

@_date: 2015-05-08 05:13:59
I did the math.
1% of the hashing power is about 3,500,000 GH/s
That's about 1,362 S4+ Antminers (2570 GH/s) which cost $964 each.
The amount comes to roughly $1.2 million dollars in equipment alone (never mind housing, power and other considerations) just to spam the network for a few months.

These two statements strike me as conflicts of each other. I can't imagine any hardfork being non-controversial so why not rip the band-aid off and increase the max block size to something that won't need to be changed again in just a few years?
Furthermore, we're talking about an increase in the *maximum* block size. This is the only aspect that requires a hard fork. The miners are still in complete control of how large the blocks are and can control this individually per the needs of the network.
To me this strikes me as a community that verbally embraces a decentralized network and yet has very little faith in it's success. Let the market and miners decide for themselves. Let decentralization do it's thing.

I'm not sure what you mean. Are you expecting 100% of the hashing power will be dedicated to one chain after the fork?
@_date: 2015-05-27 01:31:47
Generally speaking people make economic decisions. Ultimately anyone who accepts bitcoin cares very little about the technical aspects of the protocol. They simply care if they can be paid. Some vocal minority can claim the opposite but when the block size changes and the network chugs along just as reliably as before how many are going to abandon the network out of principle?
@_date: 2015-05-07 17:56:04
Ultimately the miners will decide the actual block sizes. Hard forks destabilize the network and the community so pick a max size we can work with for the next 50 years. Let the miners figure out the rest.
@_date: 2015-05-06 01:44:34
Yeah? Well I'm running two nodes! Boom! Friendly competition gauntlet thrown!
@_date: 2015-05-01 05:15:38
At a high level the number they guess is appended to the data which comprises the block. This data is then hashed to see if the numeric value is less than the target.
They might guess the same number but another miner wouldn't be able to use it. The block data contains transactions including the coinbase transaction which allows the miners to transfer 25 new bitcoins to an address. Since two different miners aren't going to be sending mining rewards to the same address a number that works for one miner (probably*) won't work for the other as the resulting hash will be completely different.
I may be slightly off but that's my current understanding of how mining works.
*It's not out of the question but it would be by pure coincidence so there wouldn't be any benefit to attempting it over some other random number.

Maximum block size is not the same as actual block size. Ultimately the miners decide which transactions they want to include which means they decide the actual block size.
@_date: 2017-02-24 13:53:19
Well you shouldn't have any trouble then. You can build a transaction pretty easily using blockchain.info or a similar service to gather up your unspent outputs. Just be sure to remember that whatever you don't allocate to spend is considered a miner fee so if you have some leftover coins make sure to send them to another address you control or the same address. If you can find your old transaction that would probably be safer than trying to do this yourself. Then just reduce the output amounts enough to cover the size of the fee you want. After that you just need to read some tutorials on signing a transaction. Once the signature is set you can just paste the transaction into blockchain.info or a similar service to broadcast it and you're good.
And by the way you'd probably get more help if you just asked how to do a replace by fee. Technically it's a type of double spend but the intention isn't malicious.

Blocks contain transactions. The block that contains your transaction and every block thereafter is a confirmation. The last one or two blocks can potentially be removed (aka orphaned) if another miner gets really lucky. For more information read up on "longest chain wins".
If coinbase gives you a transaction ID on a purchase the number of confirmations can be calculated by subtracting the chain height from the height of the block that included your transaction and adding one to the result. Be aware, coinbase integrated vendors sometimes do off chain transactions.

So, you've said a lot here but I think essentially what you're saying is my ideas about how the network behaves hinges too much on trusting the miners. If that's incomplete or wrong let me know and I'll try again.
But if that is what you're saying then I would say, we have no other option. In my view the miners control the network. They always have and they always will. I'm always puzzled when people recommend against individuals purchasing some mining equipment. Of course you're not going to make any money doing it, but it absolutely makes the network stronger. It decentralizes the network on two fronts, not only by distributing the hash power of the network to more people but also leads to the unprofitability of centralized mining.
One other thing:


I'm not sure if you were just coming up with a comparison but I wanted to verbalize that I don't think the blocksize limit should be removed. I just think it should be increased to a size that will conceivably work for the next several years. I wouldn't advocate the blocksize limit be configurable for the same reason I gave with the mining reward. Altering it would easily lead to a miner to waste a bunch of hashing so I don't think anybody would actually use it and hence, why develop it?
I do support miners ability to decide their own max block sizes by deciding which transactions to include when creating a block. Not only because I can't think of a practical way to force them to do anything else but also because it will allow each miner to get an individual idea of what's best for the network and provide it.
I think you understood me but I just wanted to make sure it was clear.

@_date: 2016-01-25 22:50:06
Which easy and simple solution do you recommend?
1. A hard size change of 2mb. Results in kicking the can down the road.
2. Adjustable block size. Potentially results in centralization.
3. Scheduled block size increase. Potentially not lining up with the growth of the network. (Results in 1 or 2)

@_date: 2015-05-07 18:00:48
He's taking on too much responsibility here. All they're doing is changing the *maximum* block size. The miners are still fully capable of keeping the block sizes at 1mb if they want and changing their minds overnight. The difference is they won't need a hard fork to make this change. 
The miners aren't stupid. If they don't process enough transactions people can't spend their money and the value of bitcoin drops to zero. If they allow too many transactions they lose their node network and the value of bitcoin drops to zero. Make the max size something that will work for the next 50 years and let the miners figure out the best actual size for themselves.
@_date: 2016-01-06 15:49:32

@_date: 2015-05-27 17:35:31
I think you're making a couple of assumptions here. The protocol change only defines 20mb as a limit. This means first, the blocks wouldn't necessarily fill up to 20mb immediately. Even with 1mb blocks there are some which are completely empty aside from the coinbase transaction. 
Second, miners can still decide for themselves to put &lt;20mb, &lt;10mb or even &lt;1mb of transactions in the blocks they mine. While they will still accept any mined block up to 20mb from other miners this means that the average block size will still be far lower than 20mb. If it becomes apparent that the chain growth is unsustainable for the network more miners can make this change *without forking* or making any disruptions to the network.

I don't think this is obvious to everyone. The current design is difficult for people, especially non-technical people, to understand. Non-opt-in RBF is easy to understand and likely the way the miners would behave regardless. Opt-in RBF only makes the behavior more complicated to explain.

I think it will prove to be immaterial.
Microsoft, IBM and whatever other company will eventually use their positions to drive Linux distros in a certain direction. Though it won't be immediately obvious to everyone it will of course be a direction in which consumers lose. I consider this a foregone conclusion.
However, I don't think this is anything to despair about. In the mean time these companies will provide some great open source developments which will only benefit the Linux ecosystem. Once the aforementioned "change of direction" occurs the people who were drawn to Linux because it wasn't controlled by corporate interests and government agencies will fork the code and create a new community. True, many users will stick with the MS/IBM/Whatever version but that's no different than today. You can't force people to care about security.
That's the beauty of Open Source. Those of us who care about the security of the software we use will only benefit from the features these companies will help develop.

For long term hodlers there's not much to worry about. You'll have two sets of coins and if you want to get fancy you can sell off whatever set you think is going to end up being worthless. The complication being: you'll have to make sure to move your coins in both chains so that someone doesn't replay your transaction on the other chain. Because remember, the transaction will be valid for both. The safest way to avoid this that I know of is to move both sets of coins to new addresses. Address X on chain A and address Y on chain B. If someone decides to be a dick and successfully replays your transaction on another chain it's nbd. You just try again until it works. Once they're on different addresses you don't have to worry about replays.
Personally I plan on doing nothing. A hodl is a hodl in my book. I'll do what I always do and watch the market play out. The worst case here is that I miss an opportunity to sell some coins before they become worthless.

He glosses over the "how" without recognizing that mining is currently the best known method for accomplishing the goal.

It's going to be interesting to watch this play out. In bitcoin there's devs, exchanges, miners and nodes. Exchanges for the most part don't care about block size. Outside of the price impact it doesn't really affect them. Devs are pretty split (depending on your definition of a Dev). Miners are signalling BU and nodes are signalling segwit.

At the end of the day it's the miners who decide what transactions are included in their block. You can't "commit" a zero-confirmation transaction. The block creation is the commit.
People seem to have a hard time understanding why RBF is being implemented beings that it makes so many users uncomfortable. Here's why: There is *nothing* you can do to prevent a miner from replacing a zero confirmation transaction. You can't even force a miner to adhere to RBF rules. Any one of them could download the source and tweak the RBF related code to whatever they want. RBF is simply codifying the most likely choice the miner will make. 
It isn't that the devs don't understand that people want immediately committed transactions. It's that there is no known technical solution to this problem in a decentralized authority system. Furthermore it can be difficult to explain *why* this is, especially to a non-technical person. "Well, it's up to the miner." is just going to prompt more questions. RBF is much easier to explain "if you submit two transactions the one with the higher fee is chosen". The ease of explanation is the sole benefit of RBF and the reason why Opt-In RBF is silly.

Neither of those concerns are specific enough for me to respond to. The mempool size can be increased easily and a lot of optimizations can be put into place deciding which transactions should drop off first. Without knowing what your opinions are on that there's really nothing I can say. And you can't talk about long confirmation times without mentioning the fees involved. Be more specific and then I'll be able to answer your question.

There is no such thing as a zero confirmation unreplaceable transaction. No button is going to change that.

That doesn't necessarily matter.
A node's purpose is to provide a block upon request correct? So if a proxy node provides the block requested... who cares? If the nodes charge on a per block basis (which would also encourage more bootstraps) the "real" node will still get paid. Just once, but isn't that the idea anyway?
@_date: 2016-01-23 20:17:44
There is nothing secure, semi-secure or "secure" about a zero confirmation transaction. The miner can choose whichever transaction they want and they will likely choose the one with the higher fee.

As a whole yes. But if a change to the bitcoin protocol results in the entire bitcoin user base flocking to another cryptocurrency then it could be an indication that bitcoin is not the superior cryptocurrency.
If a change to the bitcoin protocol results in the entire bitcoin user base flocking back to fiat it is an indication that further development to cryptocurrencies is necessary before they can support large user bases.

Here is the definitive answer: There is no better way to learn about digital security.
The vast majority of any class you take, any book you read, any piece of advice you read about on the internet regarding digital security will be primarily "theoretical" (or even made up). Prior to bitcoin it was extremely difficult to get any practical experience with security. For the most part the digital information you have is pretty boring. The nefarious types on the internet aren't interested in your single SSN or credit card number. Targets like, well, Target with their databases containing millions of credit card numbers are much more attractive.
Bitcoin gives you an opportunity to learn about what's possible in digital security. Wondering if your approach is secure? Put $50 of bitcoin on it and post your test on here. See if someone is able to nab your funds.
I have learned more about digital security and cryptography playing around with Bitcoin in the past couple years than I have being a developer for the last twenty.

No need to throw a hissy fit just because I called you out for being unclear.
Your wording made it sound like you considered the devs to be standing entirely alone on this. I wanted clarification because I, as a user, (and a node runner) happen to agree that more testing would be prudent given that it's not an immediate issue.

You can't. But you know as well as I do why that's a stupid question. You're the one who pointed out that nodes giving fake blocks is a concern. That concern is mitigated by storing the entire chain as it's impossible to fake the next block.

The fork changes by BU did not change the basis of a valid transaction. Therefore the transaction could be processed by either chain. If you tried to send BU coins someone could rebroadcast on the BTC network and the same thing would happen. Replay protection prevents this from happening.
There's ways to mitigate this outside of any mandates.

You can't guarantee which transaction a node (or a miner) will see first.


You can broadcast any number of transactions whether they're normal or RBF. Ultimately the miner decides which transaction to use. RBF simply codifies the choice they're likely to make anyway. (The miner wants the transaction with the larger fee.)

Not many, although decentralized systems don't usually create jobs exactly. For example the internet didn't create many new jobs directly. The markets that ran on the internet did. Bitcoin will be similar. Businesses that didn't or couldn't exist prior to a decentralized payment network will pop up.
In the U.S. most businesses are happy enough with visa but internationally there are countries which cannot conduct digital transactions due to credit card companies unwillingness to work with them.

That's an interesting question I hadn't heard of or considered until now. My initial reaction is "that's different" but I'm having trouble deciding if it actually is different or not.
My opinion is pretty off the cuff here so take it with a grain of salt.
One reason I think it might be different is it would allow a single miner to reward themselves with enough bitcoins to bring the value down to zero by mining a single block. Which would effectively kill bitcoin. 
But then again, on the decentralization side of things the other miners could always respond by forking the chain and ignoring the block and eventually every other miners chain would again be the longest.
The biggest issue here is that this could take a considerable amount of time for the miners to realign and figure out where the fork occurred. In the meantime the network would effectively be down.
So I guess I wouldn't be against it as long as the client was developed in such a way that miners could configure not only the size of the reward they give themselves but also the ability to configure automatically ignoring blocks which offer what they deem to be unfair rewards. I think this would offer the best of both worlds. Decentralization while still providing stability in the event that some miner decides to get greedy.
Of course this means it would be pretty dangerous for a miner to change either of these settings (in either direction) unless they were absolutely certain the other miners would agree. Ignoring a block every other miner accepted would result in a bunch of wasted hashing. Accepting or creating a block every other miner rejected would also result in wasted hashing.
Which leads me to believe nobody would ever mess with it and hence, why develop it?
Hopefully that makes sense. Thoughts? 
@_date: 2017-03-05 16:56:01
Shouldn't be the network be strong enough to handle this?

This is ridiculous. Participation in any system requires some form of sacrifice. If it were easy everybody would do it and therefore it wouldn't make any difference.
Also, as someone who runs a node, I find it interesting you're bemoaning cost. Part of the reason I don't want 8mb blocks is because running a node will become significantly more expensive for me. So here you are, saying "It's too expensive for me, but I'm throwing a fit because people who are contributing should be contributing more."
@_date: 2016-01-23 22:18:04


Because it's not a totally different argument.
I think the point you're trying to make is irrelevant because the underlying technology doesn't support it. The protocol cannot force the miner to choose any transaction over another. RBF, non-RBF whatever. The choice is entirely up to them. As I mentioned in the comment, there is nothing preventing a miner from downloading the latest source and altering the transaction replacement logic to whatever they prefer. Providing any illusion to the contrary, such as opt-in RBF or the "commit" button you're suggesting, is completely misleading.
There is no known approach for immediate confirmation transactions in a decentralized authority cryptocurrency system and discovering a method to do so would be as ground breaking as bitcoin itself. This isn't to say I believe it's impossible. I'm just saying it could be another 10 years until someone figures out how to make it work.
In the mean time, it's a fact that the miners make the choice. If you recognize they will usually act in their own best interests "replace by fee" is just a description of a behavior that's already happening and cannot be prevented. No button is going to change that.
@_date: 2016-01-03 19:59:52
Because nodes are expensive.
It is strange to me that in the midst of all this doom and gloom about the block sizes and everyone's admission that there aren't enough nodes nobody really seems to be discussing node payment.
I run a node and I'm happy to do so but given the number of people on this sub and I can't help but wonder how many contribute *absolutely nothing* to this project but are ever so vocal about the direction they want it to take.

If you continuously find yourself relying on a 3rd party for information and a lot of the 3rd parties give you bad information what do you do? You figure out how to stop relying on 3rd parties.

This guy doesn't know what he's talking about. The price is clearly going sideways.
@_date: 2016-01-22 00:35:06
At it's core, RBF doesn't change anything. It takes a previously undefined behavior which tended to behave a certain way by sheer coincidence and solidify it so as to drive home the fact that zero confirmation transactions are dangerous.
Comparing this against a hard fork (nevermind calling it "relatively simple") is a bit silly. The goal is, of course to increase the block size but everybody realizes a hard value will simply kick the can down the road. Alternatives which allow for a dynamic size could potentially threaten decentralization and scheduled sizes may not align with the actual growth of the network. Of course, this has all been explained at length in numerous discussions.
@_date: 2016-01-15 16:21:52

If decentralized authority is not important to you there's no need for a blockchain. When contrasted against centralized authority systems any blockchain implementation is *terribly* inefficient with absolutely zero benefit.
To be fair, if you're saying the technology behind Bitcoin is the innovation as far as how it has been implemented in other decentralized authority currencies like LiteCoin for example I wouldn't disagree with you.
But if you're talking about the centralized authority approaches the banking industry is trying to come up with you're talking about snake oil. If any improvement is made to the banking industry's architectures under the guise of "blockchain" it is in name only. It's no secret their architecture is based on aging technology which could benefit from hundreds of innovations which have been made in the past few decades. None of which have the slightest relation to any blockchain. Essentially, if you dug into the code you'd see all they did was find the motivation to get rid of their mainframes.

The effect is similar but the parallel is more akin to losing a certain percentage of your money on every turn. Incentivizing you to spend your money on hotels, houses and property. The analogy carries when you ask the question "What if there aren't any properties, houses or hotels for me to buy?" If you require what little assets you posses to remain liquid then the banks are effectively telling you to kick rocks. Except if everybody does that they'll call out for capital controls and abolishment of cash and outlawing of gold and equivalent commodities.

To add, if you are interested in investing be prepared to commit some time to learning how the technology works. There are lots of tutorials and lots of people here on the sub who are eager to teach you. Like OP said, buy a small amount and play with it so if you make a mistake and lose a key it's NBD. Millions of dollars have already been lost due to improper handling of bitcoin. Learn about hardware wallets, brain wallets, air gapped systems, digital signatures, the potential dangers of address reuse and most important of all: ANY BALANCE YOU DO NOT ALLOCATE FROM AN ADDRESS WILL BE SENT TO THE MINER.
If that doesn't suit you and you would like to invest anyway you could leave your bitcoin in the exchange. Be aware: Almost every major exchange has been hacked and while some have recovered many have not. Circle and Coinbase are no Mt.Gox but maintaining *real* digital security on an exchange is difficult. Who knows if more mistakes will be made. (Personally I believe there will be.)

There's a few things you should read up on:
1. The SHA hash function and about how many calculations it takes to produce a hash.
2. Estimate how many hashes per second it can generate.
3. Compare that against mining equipment and see how much BTC that averages out to when mining in a pool.
4. Compare power consumption of the supercomputer versus the equivalent ASIC.

2. The URL text box has improved significantly. I appreciate all the work there. Last thing I'd like to see is when I trigger focus with a click and drag to select text rather than drag the text.
Great work tho. I've already put some bitcoin in my browser wallet for donations.

The fastest and most power efficient way to earn bitcoin is with an ASIC (google that for some good info) While a super computer may be able to hold it's own mining on the bitcoin network the amount of electricity it would consume would cost more than the bitcoin it could mine.

Coinbase and Circle, from what I've heard, only seem to care about the money going in and out from their wallets.

RUN A MINER!

Oh good for a moment I thought this was serious. You never know these days!
@_date: 2015-07-14 18:18:14
This is a more complicated question than you might think so let me try to explain the many "yes" and "no" answers depending on context.
As you may be aware, the bitcoin protocol designates "the" blockchain as the longest chain. This is important because there's nothing stopping a miner from simply ignoring everybody else's blocks and continuing on it's own chain. The reason that doesn't happen is because the protocol, and the majority of people who use bitcoin, wouldn't consider it "the" blockchain and hence the ledger would be meaningless. It's important to realize this is a pretty arbitrary distinction in the same way that the test net isn't considered real money. It works in almost exactly the same way as the real blockchain but everybody agrees it's not real money.
So, that being said, what can and does happen on occasion is due to propagation issues or two miners finding a block at almost exactly the same time there will be two blockchains. At that point a decision has to be made by the miners. Which blockchain do they use? The best answer is of course the chain with the most hashing power as that is the chain which is likely to grow quicker and will defeat the other chain. Problem is, the miners don't always know which chain that is so some guesswork comes into play. Sometimes it makes sense to just stick with one until you get relayed a block that's more than two or three ahead of yours. Time to cut your losses and the block you mined and get back to work on the main chain.
So, here's the first example of how bitcoins can be "stolen" or at least taken away. A miner mines a block but it doesn't end up in the longest chain so they don't receive any rewards. These are called "orphaned blocks".
Another way bitcoins can be stolen in this process is if someone sends out two sets of transactions to these miners. One transaction sends all the money from Wallet A to Wallet B and another transaction sends all the money from Wallet A to Wallet C. This is called a "double spend" attack and it takes advantage of the confusion that occurs when there are two competing chains. Eventually one chain will win out so the money will really only be spent once but if you can temporarily trick someone into thinking the transaction which eventually ends up discarded in an orphan block you can receive your goods and disappear into the night.
The important thing to notice in all of this is that the chain which has value is really just the chain that most people agree has value. So if the majority of the miners, nodes, exchanges and general bitcoin users population decides "Hey something went very wrong at block height 300,000. We're gonna roll it back." it could happen. Something like this already happened but the community was a lot smaller back then.
Point is, yes, the ledger can be rolled back. It wouldn't be easy because you'd need a reason that a lot of different parties can get behind but it is possible. That's why the decentralization aspect is so important. The more people that are involved, the harder it is to alter the ledger for corrupt or insignificant reasons.
TL;DR - Buy a miner and run a node to keep it from happening.
@_date: 2015-08-07 06:56:50
Not necessarily. If there were enough support for both then both would be valuable and the markets would reflect that. Initially it would be roughly split in half, mean your coins on both chains would be worth half on the open market but you have twice as many. Once the market shifted around and settled it would probably be more lopsided but very little if any value would be lost and at that point you could dump the coins you prefer least to an interested buyer and hop over to the chain you prefer.
All this doom and gloom over the coming fork is overly pessimistic.

The difference is that a centralized blockchain doesn't deliver any new value that a standard database with transaction history didn't already.
So in a way it's the same evolution because for the longest time everybody in the financial sector is using their intranet-like financial databases when really it would be better to use a single internet like database. People who are developing private blockchains just aren't getting the drift.

@_date: 2015-08-12 01:00:26
Let me get into some details here to clear up some misconceptions.
As you probably know already, bitcoins are "owned" by you because the blockchain ledger shows a balance on a particular address that you control. A block size fork in no way changes this fact.
In reality forks are happening all the time. Double spend attacks, orphaned blocks and recommended number of confirmations are all due to the chain forking for any number of reasons. Greedy miners can withhold a solved block, failure to propogate etc. Typically these forks only exist for a block or two. (Roughly 20 minutes) The reason the block size fork is actually mentioned is because it's likely that two chains will survive longer than 20 minutes so there's a higher risk of double spends. So, if your coins are in cold storage and you're not spending them there isn't anything for you to worry about. Like most people, I believe that one chain will die off "fairly quickly" as in a day or two.
However, there is a small possibility that *both* chains will survive and that can make things more complicated. What that means is your cold storage keys could be used to spend your coins on either chain. So if you have 5 btc now and both chains survive you would have 5 coins of btc1 and 5 coins of btc2. At that point it's more of a question of economics what would happen. I'm speculating here but given that it would effectively double the number of coins that people are attaching value to that would likely drive down the price of both coins. But, given that you have twice as many you'd still have about the same purchasing power. Once things settle down I would expect people to begin selling off whichever coins they don't really want. Individuals would trade their btc1 for btc2 and visa versa.
Again that last part is pure speculation as nothing like this has happened before (and probably won't) I just wanted to mention it because it is one situation where cold storage coins would be somewhat affected.

Strong encryption does nothing when there's a problem with the system itself. If you're storing credit card numbers / social security numbers those numbers have to be decrypted at some point in order to be used? So where do you store the key? In the app. I mean you have to right? The application needs to be able to access the unencrypted data. Sure it might be hidden in the bowels of some compiled DLL somewhere but I've seen plenty of apps that just grab it from a config file. Not that it matters really. Even if it was in the code itself as long as you already have access to the data it's not a stretch to say that you have access to the application. Grab that in the process of your attack and dig through it with a decompiler at your leisure. It's a pretty sure bet they didn't roll their own encryption algorithm which means they're going to call an external library to do it. Make a guess about which library they're using and quickly search the code for any references to it. Even in a million line codebase you'll get 10 or so hits. Somewhere nearby that code there will be a string literal that looks something like "

You're on the right track. They'll pick a block size that say, 75% of the mining pools can handle and let the rest starve. With 25% of the competition eliminated now they control a higher percentage of the total hashing power of the network. Rinse repeat until they control 50% of the hashing power. Boom.
Of course, this would take time to do and everybody from casual investors to coinbase could watch it happen which could put a negative pressure on the price. So the goal of this miner would probably have to be to destroy bitcoin, not simply gain control of the network.
My point is, it's more complicated than people make it out to be.


That's not true either. 1-2 block forks occur all the time and it doesn't prevent transactions from going through. Typically speaking all the same transactions are in both tips of the fork.
@_date: 2015-11-08 17:45:18

Cryptocurrency is still an incredibly young technology. Saying "it doesn't sound like it's going to work" this early on is akin to saying that news on the internet didn't sound like it was going to work. You have no idea. Nobody does.
Point is, advertising is harming the web. This is a potentially viable solution. If you want to voice the opinion that it won't work then put some minimal effort to demonstrate how. That approach has value. Carelessly dismissive attitudes are trash.

I think you're touching on the point here. The problem isn't that journalists are getting paid, it's that they're getting all their pay channeled through a very small number of people. If that small number of people decides they don't want journalist to write a certain article or voice a particular opinion it doesn't happen. It's an all or nothing gig. Bitcoin means that any number of people can make that decision and the author has more freedom to decide when to exercise their principles (and potentially lose a bit of revenue) or let something which doesn't really matter to them slide (and please the crowd).
It's decentralized funding. Bitcoiners should understand the value here.

I don't disagree with your premise but I think your example is wrong. Controlling retailers isn't a practical method because all that person would need to do is transfer their coins to someone living in another country where those retailers don't care. The coins get mixed a bit and eventually they have to be accepted by U.S. retailers because the tainted coins only comprise a small percentage of the transaction. If this weren't allowed you could easily throw a wrench into everybody's day by sending out dust to a bunch of addresses.
It would be much more practical to go after miners and tell them not to process any transactions coming from that address. Once again underlining the importance of decentralized mining.
**EDIT:** One potential solution is: Nothing. Accept the fact that this is the way bitcoin works. As bitcoin gains legitimacy so do cryptocurrencies as a whole. What does this mean? You move your savings out of bitcoin into an altcoin designed with mixing baked in like Monero. Bitcoin doesn't need to be the only answer to gaining real financial independence.

When people rail against censorship they're talking about institutionalized censorship. Individual censorship happens all the time. For example if we don't like a certain author, we don't buy their books. If you want to take it a step further you can tell everyone why you don't like that author and why everybody else should avoid their books. This goes a bit beyond individual censorship but it's still a long way off from institutionalized censorship. This is essentially what luke-jr is doing.
I don't happen to agree with his perspective on it but as long as an uncensored version is available and as equally accessible I don't see an ethical issue.
@_date: 2015-10-27 23:05:55


They're creating... *something* and I have no doubt it will function. But the "blockchain" side of it is useless at best and extremely detrimental at worst. So much so I would be very surprised if developers are actually incorporating anything remotely blockchain-esque into their source code. If there were a real technical counter argument to this it would only take two or three sentences to explain the benefit. None exist. All the documentation that exists on permissioned blockchains is pages and pages of vague sales speak.

Based on what? Industries across the board are dominated by people who's only real qualification is that they have a lot of money. More so now than any time in history. Even worse, their wealth isn't just tied up in the status quo of their own industries, but others as well creating an innovation gridlock where the only money being spent is on the dwindling innovations being made in spaces that don't challenge any established giants. These options are dwindling as evidenced by the fact that literally billions of dollars are being poured into products that are bleeding money and have no real idea how to convert their users into a steady revenue stream. When these are the only options it's not hard to understand why desperation has set in. People are waking up to the fact that you don't have to create a solid product to sell anymore because none of the people with all the money have any clue what to do with it.

Why does it matter?
@_date: 2015-10-07 20:18:39
Ah okay I'm seeing the problem.
First, you're comparing the transactions per day that bitcoin currently has against the transactions per day that Bank of America had back in 1983. Yes, in this sense the bitcoin network is inefficient. However, this isn't something inherent to the technology. It's just overpowered for the amount of use it's getting. Kind of like using a V8 to commute to work everyday. You're not wrong but I don't think this really has any meaning as the intention is for bitcoin's use to increase which won't immediately require more power.
Second, the BTC network can only process 7txs/sec maximum. However this is simply a protocol restriction and again removing that restriction won't result in more energy consumption necessarily. Certainly not at a 1:1 ratio.
So yeah, the BTC network is inefficient but only because it isn't being used at it's maximum potential. But you could use that argument against any device or service that's being experimented with. We're still ramping up.

I haven't seen anyone recommend MyCelium trader yet. I dunno what wallet you use but MyCelium wallet works on both iPhone and Android. They have a feature which allows you to trade with people close by.
While this takes care of some security concerns is does open up other possibilities. Meeting someone in person who you don't know to exchange cash will always carry a degree of risk.
If you can figure out some way to mitigate that risk to your comfort the trading tool has the nice feature of locking in the price at the moment you agree to the trade. Not when you meet. Of course if the price changes dramatically I would expect either the buyer or seller would cancel the trade. But it at least handles small variations.

I'm not sure if I'm following your logic. Such a network as you've described would only be secure if there were no attackers. Every database expends some amount of energy on security. Not simply on read/write permissions but accessibility as well. (By accessibility I mean the prevention of denial of service attacks.)


You say this as if this is a problem that's specific to bitcoin. Going back to my denial of service attack example there's a constant arms race going on to prevent sites and services being taken down in this manner.
@_date: 2015-10-07 18:22:15
Er. As I've said already I'm not disagreeing that the bitcoin mining economy is an arms race. I don't really see a way around that.

Now if fucking Coinbase would try to springboard off this decision to say that they don't have to require a pile of identifying information before someone can buy bitcoin it'd be perfect. But they won't because they're spineless do nothings.

Fuck coinbase.

I recommend mycelium trader or localbitcoins. Coinbase will make you submit a ton of documentation and generally just treats their customers as if they were criminals

So, because you've had a positive experience everyone else should shut up? 4 days without an answer is unacceptable. Period.
