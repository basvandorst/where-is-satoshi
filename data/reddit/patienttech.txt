I think you're kind of right.  I''m not sold on Bitocoin being worth over 10k, but I'll stake a claim it's worth more than $1.

Do you think its a tech bubble?  Last time, companies were worth billions but had no actual revenue or profits.  That's not the case this time.  Tech in the Bay Area is booming because that's where the money is.  As in, companies that actually make profit.  
What's going to come along and take over tech?  Maybe some cheap energy invention or something...But it's not like Steel mills an Sears Roebuck catalogs are going to come roaring back across the country.

I think they will just fire up the printing press and devalue the dollar so they can pay the debt back easier.  Inflation divorced from commodities is what, ~3%ish (historically) but your S&amp;P 500 has an average return of ~8%?  Where's our real inflation sit?  
I don't know all the tiny nuances of it, but I know there are lot of accounting tricks at their disposal too.

This time though, credit limits are much tougher.  I haven't heard of anyone calling their house an ATM yet.

I like Litecoin for being cheap. Cheap to buy, cheap to transfer.
Ether has some really interesting technology in the smart contracts I don’t think we’ve seen any actual usage out of ether.
On a relative basis, they’re cheap compared to bitcoin.  If all three plunge to 5$ each, those two don’t fall nearly as far...

I wouldn't call Twitter the driver of the force.  Apple, Google, Facebook don't make a profit?  Amazon makes tons of money but he reinvests most of it, so not sure if it counts.  Those are what I consider the 'real' tech companies.
Tesla, yeah, you're right, all day long.  But all these figures are easily available on 10K forms.  
There's plenty of tech making actual money.  People aren't going to stores anymore and the internet is the clear future.  
Hey, maybe I just need to be a little more clear on what my expectations are.  I'm talking the Facebook / Google / Apple tech.  Maybe if SHTF, they can pull back 20%?  But it's not like they not real business' and everything they do is worth zero.  Even if a disruptive technology comes along, it'll be a gradual slide out of these companies, not a drop like a rock.  Which is fine as well, the market can handle orderly sector rotations.

True, but unless you're going to go there and manage it and repair stuff, it's the easiest way to take advantage of property prices. Minus deductible expenses.  Not a bad deal, seeing as how it's totally hands off.

What is failure look like?  Bitcoin going to zero, or bitcoin stabilizing for the long term at 100-200$ but being used almost as much as Visa?
