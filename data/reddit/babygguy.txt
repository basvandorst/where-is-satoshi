Any coin bought within mtgox are just internal transactions and do not relate directly to a real bitcoin. But any coins deposited into mtgox should be in their wallet.

Bitcoinbuilder is at 5% so therefore according to Bitcoin Builder the outcome for MtGox should be &gt;5%... That might come in the form of part funds or delayed payout etc.

A quick google gave me this -

Correct, I second this. At the end of they day it all comes down to risk tollerence. But never having the private key on an online system is best practice.

From memory there were claims that mtgox had agreements with mining pools to prioritize transactions (regardless of fees). Not sure if it was confirmed but it makes sense.

True, MtGox may have had the same conclusion as you. But that doesn't discount the possibility of a flaw in the pool (e.g. leaking the transaction and accepting higher fees over lower ones) which would allow a changed tx to take priority and reject the MtGox transaction?
I'm not sure I'd put so much trust in a pool. Yeah it might make things harder but also may have led to an oversight of the issue and over-trusting the reliability of the tx...
Edit: That also doesn't rule out another entity having a seemingly valid and inconspicuous agreement similar to that of MtGox. Maybe in the case of a double spend the 2nd transaction is accepted over the MtGox one when both parties have priority? I don't claim to know what I'm talking about, just putting out scenarios that would make the lose of coins through T.M. plausible if too much trust was put into the system and not enough on localized auditing.

Depends what ur risk tolerance is.
For a hot wallet at least I can't see why not. Easy(ish) to do using the generic PKCS11 interface. But I'm scared an exchange might decide its safe enough to store cold wallets in their too... Which has its risks if managed incorrectly.

You forgot the best part, the tag under the image - "OK Glass, find me the nearest bankruptcy lawyer."

If your private keys (in the wallet) are safe your funds are safe. There is no security reason why u might want to transfer to another wallet if there is no risk of the private keys being compromised.
A user may decide the easiest way to spend coin in a wallet is to load the wallet into a online system. As soon as a wallet is on an online system there is an added risk the wallet will be compromised so its advised the remaining funds are transferred to a cold wallet.
