have you seen what seansoutpost is doing? i think this is a very trustworthy project and a good example of how transparent it can be.

ok i get your point. here in germany everything also seems just fine and the same applies for most people in the us. for now that is. i´m basically implying that interesting times are ahead as we´re approaching the tipping point.

yeah the same applies for microloans and either that needs an own site or there could be categories. food, health, school,... and maybe business (where you can ask for microloans with a business idea)
however, my main focus on this idea is pretty much donating small puchases instantly. i am hoping to find a concept that makes it more attractive for people to get active and donate. i have done some reading on how the brain works and it it was no surprise to find out that people love instant reward.

you: Peg your currency to gold or copy the scarcity of bitcoin. Figure it out FFS Argentina.
sebicas: If a Government do that, how would it survive? Taxes along are never enough.
you: Switzerland and Japan seem to be doing just fine.
in these two countries they didn´t peg their currencies to gold or copy the scarcity of bitcoin. they both have central banks that are heavily printing yen/sfr. 
and since sebicas started hoping for politicians like they have in china/switzerland, i felt like pointing this out. not even talking about the exports of these countries.

here you see a graphic of the yen traded in euro: 
and for switzerland: the SNB sort of pegged the Franken to the Euro (buying for 1.20 at any time) which becomes very obvious when you look at the chart. what this means for their currency is not what would make the better informed swiss happy about his currency.

switzerland and japan are doing just fine? where did you get that?

well someone must have first bought it for bitcoin then.

let me give you an example:
a mother makes a request for day out in the zoo with her kids. she needs 50$ for this trip. she can post a picture of family of family saying that the kids have never been to the zoo and that she can´t afford it. 
then someone donates and on sunday she posts an update with some happy pictures at the zoo. 
i mean this is sort of happening here on reddit already sometimes. for example the girl in the hospital that got so many pizzas. not that they were begging. i mean that people donated to make the girl happy and of course they were also happy when they saw the update. 
i think if there was a platform that sort of worked like this bitcoin would be perfect and it would be very helpful for those posting on the site. 
you could even do it for other people. if you know of someone who could really use a sleepingbag, why not ask if someone will donate it, go buy it and post an update. 
@_date: 2013-08-04 02:49:12
Ok i will try :)
imagine a website where you sort of browse through donation-requests. i am thinking of individuals posting maybe a picture of a very old and dirty matress and the child that has to sleep in it and saying that 0.3 BTC could get him this new mattress. sort of like when someone on reddit gives proof with a picture and the redditname. so you see this picture and a few lines about the request. maybe even a video in some cases. then you can donate and of course the thankful family will post a picture update showing the kid in his new bed as a thank you.
so this system would work on a very small level. i am not at all against other charities that operate under good conditions, but they mostly tackle bigger projects. 
i also think that this personl level would encourage more people to donate simply because they get a direct feedback. maybe even instantly is someone was asking for a meal. 
i actually think that a "trusted partner" would have 2 benefits. one of course avoiding scams. and two a wider "market". imagine this:
say we have a trusted party in a region with poor people that handles the requests. you can go there, say what you need and kind of convince people of your need. this goes up on the website and rich people with a little guilt can go to sleep with the confidence of having little marvin a new mattress or some family in africa or the middle east food for the day. 
i hope you better understand now. i am not even saying that this idea is morally super clean since i see some issues. however i do think that it could work and help poor people get what they need. and since there are lots of people in need the advantages seem to outweight the disadvantages by far.

Trace Mayer has a pretty good answer to the first part of your question from just a couple of days ago: 
@_date: 2013-08-03 22:16:05
i just donated .25 BTC and probably wouldn´t have heard about his case if it wasn´t for bitcoin. it´s pretty sad to see michael hastings listed as one of the supporters :/
@_date: 2013-08-04 01:31:47
thanks. they have a very similar vision. the only difference i can see is that their approach is to help other charities get funding while i was thinking more of very individual projects/fundings.

ok so i went to take screenshots and realized that it wasn´t yesterday, shame on me. felt like yesterday, i promise! the message stays the same though. [here´s the link](
don´t ask me why they still have it marked as pending
@_date: 2013-08-22 19:28:47
I know this doesn´t tell us much about bitcoin. At the same time it is quite the news concerning the traditional monetary system. And after all it´s stuff like this that drives people into bitcoin. So yeah, pretty crazy shit. I´m curious to see if this will get picked up.

Hi SeansOutpost,
please check out my idea here: 
It was inspired by your project and i would love to get an opinion!
Cheers and keep up the good work!

ah thanks for the link. i was expecting this video not to be the source of the visualization.
