Agreed. That's been my experience too.

Here's what I've used in the past. There are many extra steps you can take to increase security (using a computer that has never been on the internet and such) but I generally consider them unnecessary.
You will print the wallet using the guide and it will have the public and private keys printed together. Then you send all your bitcoins to the public key from your online services. I don't use blockchain.info anymore but I believe you can also import public "watch" keys there and then just keep an eye on your money to reassure yourself it's still tied to the paper wallet keys.
Make a special note of the warning about removing the balance. You can't put 10 bitcoins on a paper wallet and then spend them one by one over the course of time because of the way change addresses work. If you ever remove anything from this wallet you should import the private keys to a proper wallet (even an online one) spend as you wish then send the whole balance back to a new paper wallet. Paper wallets are really only for long term storage as using them day to day is kind of a bear.
@_date: 2016-08-03 14:29:27
For long term storage you should just print the keys and store the piece of paper in a safe. IMO this is even better than hardware wallets because it is totally future proof. Even if your house gets burgled it's pretty unlikely that the burglar will also understand what those keys are.
@_date: 2016-08-03 15:52:55
Even tiny cheap safes are fire proof. That's practically the only purpose of a safe since any kind of thief could just pick it up and walk away with it.

So just as the block reward is reducing we make sure to also decrease the number of transaction fees paid by making the blocks bigger. What do you think the network hashrate will be next year when block reward lowers to 12.5 if transaction fees don't make up the difference? The answer: half as much as it is now.
@_date: 2015-06-02 19:45:14
Bitcoin Core automatically calculates the fee that needs to be paid for your transaction to conrfirm "quickly".
@_date: 2015-06-02 13:16:23
I don't think that helps unless you are actually mining new blocks.
@_date: 2015-06-09 12:29:34
Good point. I can't trust the predictions of a man who has only been a redditor for four days. Find me a bonkers scenario generated by someone whose been here for a few years!
@_date: 2015-06-16 15:14:15
What's going to happen if all these banks start using "blockchain technology" but the actual bitcoin hashrate continues to shrink like it has been? Colored coins flying around are not going to affect the value of bitcoins so the block reward could continue to shrink in dollar terms.
I suppose it works if they pay enough transactions but seems like we're going to increase the block size to prevent that from happening.
@_date: 2015-06-17 12:49:54
You're right about there being a smaller hashrate drop than I would have expected. However I just wanted to add that if demand is the same then the price will be the same and therefore the hashrate will move in line with the block reward.
@_date: 2015-06-17 11:01:24
That's ridiculous. You can't pay people for work by deflating everyone's currency. The long term future of bitcoin has to be that the value stabilises or at worst drifts slowly upwards. To the moon is not a long term strategy for a sustainable currency.
I agree though that the way bitcoin currently works is completely infeasible when it comes to transaction fees. There's needs to be a smoother user experience i.e. they can be reasonable sure that paying X fee will result in Y delay before confirmation and then use that information to decide how much to pay.
One of the current problems is that if the blocks actually are full then all the unconfirmed transactions build up in memory forever and then the nodes fall over.
@_date: 2015-06-05 10:15:38


Agreed. I bought a small amount of bitcoins when they were worth 0.20 but there's no way I would have bought any more at the time considering the incredible risks involved.
@_date: 2015-06-17 11:34:30
Not one of these articles have ever specifically said that they are using the bitcoin blockchain. Do you think these idiots will create their own independent blockchains? HTF will they convince anyone to mine on them? Will they set up their own independent mining farms for their personal blockchains?
@_date: 2015-06-02 19:31:04
OK, so seems like we agree that lowering the block reward will lower the security of the network. I imagine we also agree that increasing the block size will reduce the number of transaction fees paid per block ergo increasing block size reduces the security of the network which is the point I was initially trying to make.
@_date: 2015-06-17 11:25:33
Nobody cares about the profitability of miners except the miners themselves. What we all care about is the number of miners.

This seems quite interesting but I just get


and then nothing for several minutes. Also my bitcoin app sadly can't detect your QR code.
@_date: 2015-06-03 05:50:08
Well if the transaction fee exceeds the penalty then they will include the transactions.
@_date: 2015-06-17 10:45:58
We want miners to receive fees as more miners means more hashrate which means more security.
@_date: 2015-06-10 06:05:59
I agree that block size should not be unlimited because we need a restriction on size to create transaction fees. This will be especially important as the block reward shrinks and fewer people can make money mining. However, it seems right now bitcoin totally cannot handle it if there are more transactions than can fit in the blocks. Memory use increases as those unconfirmed transactions build up and up and none of them ever go through and there's no way to cancel a transaction or alter it to add a larger fee so it really makes a total mess of the network.
@_date: 2015-06-17 11:43:50
What's your point? It's easy to short BTC and people who've been shorting it for the last year are probably laughing all the way to the bank.
Here's something for you. In the last month my volume on bitfinex is 15BTC and 14000LTC. What's my total balance? ~$200. It's the same money going round and round and round.
@_date: 2015-06-17 12:58:39
Just trying to give you a real life example mate, no need to be a dick about it.
@_date: 2015-06-02 13:14:13
There's another reason that I don't see anyone discussing. The block reward is on a schedule to decrease to 0. Right now it is 25BTC but late next year it will be 12.5BTC. If the block reward drops then there will be a much lower incentive to mine. The expectation was that transaction fees would increase slowly to make up this difference. However, if the block size is unlimited then there is no reason to pay a transaction fee as transaction will always be included in the next block.
Satoshi intended for there to be competition between people adding transactions such that the fees would be enough to support the network. Without an upper limit on the blocksize this economic incentive will not exist and mining will become unprofitable at the current hashrates. Blocks will still be mined at the same speed in this future but there will be many fewer miners and the network will become less secure.
@_date: 2015-06-17 10:44:34
The blocks are meant to be full. That's how we develop a market for transaction fees so that miners get paid. If we keep increasing the block size then no-one will pay fees and so fewer people will bother to mine as the block reward shrinks.
@_date: 2015-06-17 12:50:53
I think it could be really bad for bitcoin itself if all the banks start up their own unrelated chains. Good for the world though, I guess, since the technology is indeed amazing.
@_date: 2015-06-17 11:00:08
The block reward drops from 25BTC to 12.5 BTC mid next year. Unless the value of bitcoins changes we would naturally expect the hashrate to drop by 50% also.
@_date: 2015-06-17 11:42:43
The good news is that it totally doesn't matter wrt the functioning of the system. The bitcoin price will rise and people will use smaller and smaller amounts of bitcoin to transfer the same value.
The other good news is that there's simple no reason to assume this is currently happening. WIth the price dropping consistently for the last year and more and more outlets accepting bitcoins I'd say the opposite is more likely.
@_date: 2015-06-02 16:48:30
The difficulty just makes sure that blocks come out every 10 minutes. It won't help the miners make up the money they lose from the decreasing block reward. There will have to be fewer miners in order for them to be profitable or break even if the reward+fees shrinks.
To a certain extent there is an incentive to keep block sizes small as it is faster to publish a small block but we don't see that doing much right now as most miners publish blocks close to the maximum size. We may see that 20mb blocks significantly affects transmission time and savvy miners start limiting block size but I personally don't think the effect will be that large as you can still push 20MB or 100MB in a fraction of a second if you have a decent datacenter.
@_date: 2015-06-17 12:11:16
The hashrate dropped significantly running up to and after the halving.
However the bitcoin price also increased from, like, $20 to ~$50 ish quite soon afterwards counteracting the loss in block reward in USD terms. 
Presumably you're not expecting the bitcoin price to double after the next reward halving. I agree if that happens then we will maintain our existing hashrate.
I guess one thing I'm forgetting to consider is increases in hashing technology allowing people to calculate more hashes with less power. If we can get something like that then I guess we will expect to see increase hashrates.
@_date: 2015-06-17 11:37:46
I'm talking about the reduction in block rewards caused by the increasing size of the blocks (reducing transaction  fees) and the reward halving. I agree that most miners and users care very little about the block size in terms of storage and bandwidth assuming we keep it around the sizes currently being discussed.
@_date: 2015-06-02 20:00:12
OK, fair enough. I think the expectation though is that there will be fewer transactions because the transaction fee is high and/or the confirmation time is too long. I don't think we can get to a point where people are submitting transaction that takes months to confirm unless people are acting completely irrationally.
You're right though. If all the blocks are full all the time (I think maybe the transaction fee goes to infinity at this point so it would be quite expensive for everyone submitting those transactions) then if people continue to submit transactions some of them won't go through.
@_date: 2014-02-13 11:56:23
I precalculated thousands of addresses before sharing the wallet. Actually it seems to work perfectly except that tags for addresses obviously don't copy from one place to the other. I've been doing it for a year or so now - sending and receiving transactions from both wallets fine. If I ever exceed the number of pre-calculated addresses I'll just import one wallet into the other and start again.
@_date: 2014-02-13 08:52:13
Really? Because I have tons of failed transactions. Like, maybe 10% of the transactions I send don't go through for one reason or another. Admittedly a lot of this is because I reduced my transaction fees down to near 0 but that shouldn't stop transactions from happening it should just slow them down. 
I guess also I have two machines with the same bitcoin-qt wallet running which is extremely not recommended but in any case I feel like things should work better.
@_date: 2014-03-23 15:19:23

I wonder if it could work. I know there's a 15 minute round trip but let's say one block on earth takes more than that to be mined because of bad luck and Mars manages to sneak one in. At that point the optimal place to mine would be Mars and earth would be completely cut out until they could get a block in faster than then 15 minute round trip.

I don't think people are confused at all. You're the one that's mistaken. When people complain about how long transactions take at PoS they *are* talking about zero confirmation transactions. Is it really that hard to believe that a message sent from my cell phone, over the internet, to another wireless device could take minutes? Shit, my phone is on and off the 3G network all the time due to spotty coverage. I wouldn't be surprised if there are large areas in my city where a zero confirmation transaction will never confirm.
In my opinion the bitcoin protocol is not appropriate for PoS transactions in the real world. Sure, we can make NFS credit cards backed by bitcoins or whatever but the normal blockchain and internet dependency is not going to work in most places in the world. That said, bitcoin is still a powerful tool for online purchases, as a store of wealth and for person to person transfers that aren't time sensitive (such as remittances).

I think this, or something like it is absolutely necessary or floating fees are going to be a disaster. I guess we'll find out. Without the ability to negotiate fees by start low and gradually raising until the transaction is mined there's no way fees can stay stable because everyone has to overestimate the right fee in order to make sure their transaction will go through. I've put in loads of transactions that have taken days to confirm because of low fees and for 99% of users that's going to be totally unacceptable.

The real trick is that recovering private keys is very rarely a matter of just trying random numbers and hoping the right one comes up. Everyone will agree that strategy is totally hopeless. However, normally you can remember some fraction of the encryption key or maybe you recall the first couple of letters to the private key or something like that. Usually even if you remember almost nothing you can cut the search space down considerably.

@_date: 2014-02-01 16:34:28
I really think this is the way to go. Then I can issue transactions with 0 fee, wait to see if they go through and if not half an hour later add some tiny fee. Keep doing that every half hour until I get a confirmation to make sure I get the minimum possible transaction fee.

But in practice it is that simple because transactions with 0 fees will literally always be confirmed (maybe not forever into the future but certainly for all time up to now).

It's very straightforward for them to do a bank transfer to your account, receive the bitcoins and then have the transfer reversed by the bank. For cash transactions Andreas Antonopoulos discussed an event where someone gave him counterfeit bills. So it can happen to anyone. Obviously that's for selling bitcoins which you can't do at a store anyway. Harder to pull a scam off if you are buying them I guess unless you transfer the cash first and then never receive the bitcoins which I imagine must happen all the time.

Hopefully I'm not too late to get an answer to this. As I understand it the payer has to do some calculations and management of secret nonces to get the address to send payments to which is derived from the stealth address.
Does this mean that the sender needs to use special software or can they use current versions of bitcoin-qt (for example) to send payments to these stealth addresses? It doesn't help my privacy if I can only use these addresses with a small selection of vendors.

Sounds like you're reinventing freenet but with a profit incentive for nodes (which freenet never needed so I don't know why this does). In which case you should start making plans for what you will do when your decentralized datastore is absolutely full of child porn and other super illegal shit.

I think you're being deliberately obtuse. His point is valid even if he used very slightly incorrect terminology. The network hashrate is constantly increasing but the difficulty is only recalculated every 2 weeks. As a result blocks are being mined faster than every ten minutes and as a result of that difficulty is changing more frequently than every two weeks. As a result of all of that bitcoins are being mined a bit faster than the expected 25BTC per 10 minutes.
As for the other point, it is an undeniable fact that when new coins are printed everyone elses coins are decreased in value so in a very real sense we are paying for every coin mined. I guess, for me, I don't see how that's a problem but it's still a fact.
@_date: 2014-02-17 14:58:06
Seems to be both. It's a flaw in the bitcoin protocol but it was not considered serious because there were easy workarounds and in the end it didn't prevent money from moving around or allow anyone to do anything nefarious to normal bitcoin transactions. The reason "all" exchanges are susceptible though is because 99% of them are run out of one kid's basement who learned programming 6 months ago and thought he'd try out this bitcoin thing with his new php skillz. As a result most exchange implementations were not able to handle it when an attacker starting adjusting every single transaction on the network using the malleability flaw. There were some notable examples. Kraken stayed open throughout the attack claiming they were unaffected.
@_date: 2017-02-03 11:23:18

You should only remove the money from coinbase if you trust your own security more than you trust coinbase's. Most people would consider coinbase quite safe but I sure as fuck don't think it's as safe as a paper wallet. Probably not even as safe as an encrypted, backed up wallet.dat on a modern, patched windows machine.
If you're "not really smart" then you might want to consider the chances of you losing that file, accidentally deleting it, hackers stealing it from your computer, your hard drive failing without a backup etc etc. I would say for most normal people those risks are higher than the risks of using coinbase. That said, *I* would **never** store money I wasn't prepared to lose in coinbase or any other online bitcoin wallet.

Everyone agrees that there's obviously manipulation except me. When there's bad news the price goes down when there's good it goes up. From my perspective as a very heavy algorithmic trader I don't see any manipulation that affects the price in any serious way.

It shouldn't affect the price too much. It's just when deciding which exchange to use you are obviously going to pick the one with the most volume. One thing it did do price wise is when China's price moved away from other exchanges then people took it more seriously because of the huge volume so high demand in China can lead to America chasing.

One thing people are missing here is that, yes, fees were an issue but one of the main reasons for switching has been the complete lack of progress and support for Counterparty. Coloured coins were such a great idea 3 or 4 years ago and I'm really surprised that they were never fully developed by any of the competing implementations.
@_date: 2016-01-15 13:46:04
The entire point of bitcoin is that the limit should exist and a fee market should develop to work out who gets their transactions confirmed and onto the blockchain. This fee market is how miners are inventivized to do their valuable work. If we had unlimited sized blocks then we would get a lot of pointless spam on the blockchain. This has been a significant problem in the past when fees were zero because we were far from the block size limit. The other likely problem is that after a few more halvings the block reward will be too small to make it worth mining bitcoins and so the security of the entire network will be diminished. Transaction fees are intended to replace those block rewards.
One of the current issues is that it has become apparent that there are some problems with the way bitcoin handles unconfirmed transactions (storing them in memory, no way to increase the fee after a transaction has been made, etc). These issues are being resolved rather than just blindly increasing the block size which eradicates the fees and reduces the incentive to mine.
@_date: 2017-03-28 07:45:53
That's true. If we assume BTU won't implement replay protection then I guess I don't know what will happen. Could be a real shitshow. I suppose each exchange will have to pick a chain and stick with it. You can be sure that at least a few will pick BTU though so there'll still be liquidity on the BTU chain. Further there are ways to deal with it if there is no replay protection. For example after the fork you can move all of the coins on one chain to new unique addresses and then move forwards from there.
@_date: 2016-03-03 17:40:40
Really? I've been using bitcoin for years and probably have a problem of some kind or another with 1 in 10 transactions over that entire time. It's a pretty shitty way to do day to day transactions TBH. Although, I will say my experience hasn't been especially worse lately.
@_date: 2016-01-15 17:57:11


Why would the users be incentivised to pay fees by the lowering of the block reward? They won't. More likely the reward for mining will reduce and miners will drop out lowering the hash rate of the entire network. However, blocks will still be mined by the few remaining miners and so all those free transactions will continue to be confirmed but with reduced hashrate and security.
@_date: 2017-03-16 15:28:06
This is the crazy thing about the 95% activation requirement. Now we have divergent implementations of bitcoin and miners presumably running on custom code it seems like we'll never hit that threshold for anything no matter how uncontroversial it is.
@_date: 2017-03-28 07:38:55
I don't think the name will be very significant at all. If we end up with a majority of miners only mining large blocks then even if their chain is called Poopcoin it will still be the only functional way to use all these blockchain keys, ASIC hardware, hardware wallets and all the other infrastructure currently in place.
@_date: 2017-03-28 07:10:35


Do they know that? I don't think that's obvious at all. In fact they could easily fork with or without "exchanges and business". For a start exchanges have already said they will immediately list the new coin and when it comes to cashing in your mined coins those are the only businesses that really count. Everyone else will soon follow if the original coin crawls to a halt from low block rate and high fees.
@_date: 2017-03-28 11:12:58
Yeah after a long time it will eventually retarget. In my opinion it depends a lot on what hashrate BTU can muster. If they get just 70% then maybe BTC can muscle through but that would be worse for the whole system because of how contentious it would be with both chains sniping against each other forever. If we can get a complete 90% BTU fork or better still have BTU whither away and die we'll be better off.
@_date: 2017-03-24 08:00:42

@_date: 2017-03-16 21:07:42
Of course most exchanges that support alt coins will also support both bitcoin chains. No matter what, if there's a fork, both tokens will be tradable and probably neither will ever be literally "worthless". You're betting that the UASF chain has the highest value but that's far from certain and even if values are different miners will go with the chain with the best hashrate/price ratio I think.
@_date: 2017-03-14 20:10:43
I mean, welcome to the internet. BTC already went through every kind of attack anyone could think of. That's why we trust it so much.
@_date: 2017-03-07 13:00:21
I usually look out for your posts because I respect your opinion but I'm really surprised you would support this wishy washy way of implementing new features. "Economic majority" is not measurable in the same, precise, mathematical way we can count blocks. You might as well have no metric at all and just ask a committee since that same committee will be choosing who belongs on that wiki page and who doesn't (maybe we could call the committee that fills out the wiki page something snappy like "The Fed").
Bitcoin's current mechanism for softforks only allows changes that are wholly uncontroversial. Unfortunately we have a significant minority of miners who seem intent on blocking all progress unless it comes on their terms. That's fine. Bitcoin has entered a state of controversy and no rash changes should be made until the issue is settled. Inventing a mechanism to circumvent that so we can start deploying crazier and crazier releases just because blockchain.info, coinbase et al are onboard is not a safe way to proceed in my opinion.
I'm not sure what the outcome of an actual UASF split would be and I'm not sure anyone can be but I can't help but feel it would be disastrous for the long term state of  bitcoin. For now it trades on respectability and stability and we're talking about throwing all that away and going into a war between users and miners with no idea who will win.
@_date: 2017-03-07 03:36:42
Yes, Core is still very far ahead but BU is constantly increasing.
@_date: 2017-03-16 20:45:08
Why do you assume miners will follow the nodes to the new version? Isn't there a risk they will stay right where they are mining, cashing in block rewards, ignoring segwit blocks etc while the rest of us sit on a chain with no mining power and no blocks being confirmed. There could be months of slow down until the next difficulty adjustment. The segwit chain would become almost unusable and the pressure for nodes to flip to BU would be very high during that time.
If the exchanges support the BU chain and prices between the coins on the two chains are similar then there will be no incentive for miners to move to segwit.

Why would miners skip low-fee transactions? They never did that before the blocks started filling. Up until 6 months ago zero fee transactions would get in the chain within 2 or 3 blocks usually.
The only reason miners would skip low-fee transactions would be to encourage those user to raise their fees. But that incentive won't change in the future so we would expect current behaviour to match future behaviour in that respect.
@_date: 2019-03-01 21:55:37

You guys are kidding yourselves if you think the goal of UASF was to force the preemptive lock in of SegWit.

I can't find the original thread in about the transaction spam that had the calculations (because nearly every thread on is about transaction spam)
I'm not really an expert at this sort of thing, but we could try it now. The biggest mining pool has 19% of the hashrate so they will recover ~20% of the fees they might spend in this attack.
Total Transaction fees paid have gone up by about 50BTC per day
So I suppose AntPool could theoretically afford to pay 20% of 50BTC=10BTC ~= USD7300 and break even.
If either of us are right and the event is costing $10k or $100k then both ways it's not looking like an efficient use of money. I suppose it's more plausible to keep it up for political purposes if it's only costing a few thousand dollars per day but still... wow.

@_date: 2016-11-18 13:30:14
They're splitting up transactions into two parts. One part (the segregated witness) doesn't count towards the block size anymore which is why it will increase the number of transactions that can fit in a block. Another effect is that it will stop a type of attack that allowed people to change some minor details about transactions after they'd been transmitted to the network. This will open up the possibility for other advances like Lightning Network and various types of fancy contracts and scripting.
Everyone is on edge about it because it will only activate if 95% of the last 2016 blocks signal they support the feature. About 11% of the miners are in an active revolt that will prevent it from happening if they keep it up long enough. Also, after 12 months without it activating the update is abandoned automatically.
@_date: 2016-11-18 14:23:25
I think the mechanism was intended to be used for changes that were totally uncontroversial so if 95% was not reached then they could rethink the design to make it even more agreeable. What they did not take into consideration was the possibility that 10% of the miners would be against everything BitcoinCore developers released whether it was controversial or not.

@_date: 2017-04-10 07:40:57
Is that a question because it doesn't even make sense? "UASF are a super majority"? What do you mean? 
If you mean that signalling BIP148 needs to be a supermajority then you appear to be incorrect as the node level fork happens on August 1st regardless of majority or not. Nodes don't even have a way to measure node level BIP support which is why there is a fixed date. It obviously doesn't require that miners signal majority support since the entire point is to fork the majority of users away from the majority of miners and hope everything sorts itself out for the better.
If by "UASF are a super majority" you mean that the super majority will get to experience what happens after a UASF then you are correct as the consequences for good or bad will be universal on August 1st.
Lastly, after researching this a bit, the OTHER thing I object to is signalling a proposal that I don't actually have functioning software for. Signalling for BIP148 when the code doesn't even exist seems to be against the principle behind the BIP flagging system if not straight up immoral.

Well, as I mentioned, you could give vendors the option to wait until the transaction is confirmed or ignore it if they want to. There's already risks accepting L$ since transactions occasionally get reversed due to stolen credit cards or whatever. It wouldn't be too much more risky than that and most transactions are so tiny (for gambling machines on the order of pennies) that I think vendors would be willing to take the risk and if not then the vendor could run their own personal wallet that you donate to upfront.

It's not helpful to judge transactions based on the "intention" of the sender as it cannot be known. If the sender is willing to pay and the miner is willing to mine then the transaction must be accepted into the blockchain or the whole system falls apart.

If everyone on every single exchange is trying to sell then that's not a problem that limit down can solve. limit down is not about artificially forcing high prices.
@_date: 2011-06-23 17:12:01
No it doesn't require any co-ordination. Limit down just means that if the price is moving down very quickly you cancel all transactions for a short while (30 minutes or so maybe) and let everyone relax a bit. This means if I accidentally sell 400000 bitcoins instead of 400.00 then we don't get the kind of clusterfuck everyone has been dealing with.
@_date: 2011-06-29 09:32:54
The fact that they were mined at a low price isn't a problem but the lack of liquidity is. It's pretty normal to say that bitcoin supply is $110M but you're right in that if everyone tried to cash in at once you wouldn't get anywhere near that. Still, that's the case with everything really.

Bought 160 bitcoins at $0.25 per coin in November/December ish. I sold 60 of them a couple of weeks ago for $19.4/BTC. I've still got about 100 coins which I'm planning on hanging onto to see what happens. The 60 I sold a few weeks ago has still not actually arrived in my bank account, so to be honest, I'm a little doubtful of whether it will be possible for me to convert these into cash.

I was looking at bitcoin when it was worth less than a dollar and I could have mined at that time if I'd put the effort in but I would have been making less than a dollar a day. It didn't seem worth it. I don't have the exact figures but my daily profit from mining was about the same all the way until 2013ish due to upgrading CPUs/GPUs/buying an ASIC. So even those of us that /could/ mine back then generally didn't for the same reasons you aren't mining today and probably won't be mining still if the price is $10,000 in a few years time.
It's basically always better to buy them with money you are prepared to risk than to mine them.
@_date: 2011-06-23 18:35:00
I don't think you guys really understand what the purpose of this is. It's to prevent fat finger errors and hackers crashing a specific exchange. It's not some mass coordinated thing that can prevent someone from selling all their coins or prevent the entire market from selling off if that's what it wants to do. 
Right now: the hacker rolls in and buys 400k bitcoins for 0.01, then we bounce right back to $10/BTC and start creeping back towards $20/BTC
After limit down: Hacker rolls in and tries to buy 400k bitcoins on mtgox, he gets 10000 of them (at 20, 19, 18, 17 maybe) and then the market closes. Everyone goes, like, waaa, people realise there's a hack and fix it, the market opens back up at 17, everyone's all like, wow that's cheap and start buying up back to 20. In this case if I legitimately had 400k BTCs I wanted to sell at any price then I would not be stopped from doing so but the theory is that everyone else in the market would dive in and buy them from me at fire sale prices but not at 0.01. If they don't then sorry Charlie, prices are going to plummet. It will just take all day rather than 10 seconds.
@_date: 2011-06-27 14:22:58
Umm, BTC was trading $20 before the hack. Now, a week later it's $17.
@_date: 2011-07-02 07:22:47
OK, so why is everyone using all these other pools that charge 3%?
@_date: 2011-06-29 09:34:31
Well, the difference is that SL runs a legitimate exchange where you can buy and sell L$ for USD. No other game does this. Eve comes somewhat close but technically speaking you can only buy ISK not sell them.

Also forgetting difficulty increases. It's 2-4BTC per year right now, in 6 months it'll be 1-3, 6 months later 0.5-2 etc etc until you're getting tiny fractions of a bitcoin and it's not even worth your time thinking about it after just a couple of years.
@_date: 2016-10-06 13:20:23

I think I paid 20BTC or $400 for my jalapeno back when bitcoins were worth ~$20. I then went on to make something like $600 dollars from mining except by the time I stopped mining those 20BTC would have been worth $20,000 or something ridiculous. So if you squint I made a profit but in reality I would have been way better off never buying the thing in the first place.
The trouble is the price wasn't at $1200 for very long. Just a couple of months really. Bitcoin mining is a long term investment you might make your money back over the course of a year if absolutely nothing goes wrong.
@_date: 2015-11-04 13:05:58
Well, I'll take the opportunity to get the last word in and provide a non-handwaving reason why blocksize must be limited. The fee market must exist otherwise miners don't get paid. The system works with free transactions today because the block reward is so large but as it shrinks over time it was expected that the transaction fee would replace it. If blocksize increases without bound then transaction fees will remain 0 and there will be no reason to mine in the future.
@_date: 2017-05-29 14:08:26
Miners can probably merge mine both chains so maybe the hash rate will be much the same for both forks.
@_date: 2015-11-04 12:11:07
As the price increases the number of transactions will be reduced because people will stop using the blockchain for trivial transactions. That is the entire purpose of the fee market. It's, like, the underpinning principle of why bitcoin works.
@_date: 2015-10-17 07:39:21
I've been running joinmarket with ~5BTC for the last 10 days and I have made .00171695BTC or $0.45 at today's prices. Joinmarket profits are real but they are way too small to power an entire server or even a cloud hosted app without the server.
To my mind the income only barely covers the risk of keeping the money in a hot wallet. Maybe not even that.

It's an exact duplicate of what happened when they blocked withdrawals from mtgox. The price rocketed on one exchange because everyone had to buy BTC to cash out. The other exchanges followed leading to a feedback loop.

It's pretty simple and you just have to use the right docker image. Only thing about those old posts that is incorrect is that the memory use is closer to 3G but part of that is because I have set minrelaytxfee to 1 satoshi. It took ~36 hours to sync.
I'm happy to answer questions if you have any.

Opposite. The blockchain is public so using it affords LESS anonymity.  Separately stock trades are not stored in a centralised system. You have your system I have mine, Bank's A, B and C have their own. That is why it takes so long to settle stock trades right now.
@_date: 2015-10-19 09:33:51
Exactly. From the consumer perspective credit cards are cheaper to use then bitcoins. Hell, credit cards even have cash back whereas bitcoin transactions cost a penny or two.

One thing that's getting me down is that this a blatant repeat of the mtgox bubble. One exchange block dollar withdrawals so the BTC price shoots up as people panic buy to withdraw cash. Then all the other exchanges follow it causing a never ending cycle of buying which will ultimately collapse. Besides I already set my cash out price at 10-20k so 1k or 2k doesn't really get me much closer to anything useful.

I must admit I saw the similarities between the two bubbles - especially with the media led hype. Last time I did quite well and sold at $25 just before the peak of $30 and I felt quite smug for myself. This time I missed the burst and sold out around $100 hoping to buy back in at ~$30-50. Obviously so far that has proved to be a mistake but I'm holding on. I think we could see it slide back down over the course of the next week to the more "sustainable" $30 and then continue the slow rise upwards as per pre-hype normality.

One major difference is that the film companies had to convince the ISPs to help while the ISPs were financially incentivised not to. Furthermore telecoms companies were at least on a par with the influence of the film industry so it was hard to make progress passing laws. For bitcoins the banks are the ones who may want to get rid of bitcoin and they are also in charge of who is allowed to have a bank account. So they have both the incentive and the means to do this without any outside help.

What could happen is for someone to start up enough ASICs to multiply the difficulty by 100 or 1000 or something bigger and then if they turn them all off again no-one will be able to mine any blocks for some unknown amount of time, maybe months.

Here is a discussion about it.
The gist of it is that when you spend coins what actually happens is your whole balance is sent to the target and change is sent back to a new randomly generated address. Normally your wallet app handles this change address to receive the returning coins invisibly.

This is a very interesting perspective but you say " we know how it will end", well online gambling is now legal in Nevada and it is plenty popular across the rest of the world so maybe things aren't looking so bad after all.

The confused old woman makes a pretty reasonable point. It's very hard to "have the bits" if you don't have one of "these phones". Some sort of cheap paper version of bitcoins would be  a lot more convenient for most people. Failing that one of the little hardware wallets but they'd have to be super cheap before anyone is going to seriously want to buy them.

I've heard conflicting views about that. As I've heard it the normal bitcoin-qt client won't allow you to send 0 fee transactions even though it looks like it is doing so. I'd like a lot more details on this actually, like if I transfer money out of my mining pool or if I send a transaction from bitcoin-qt how can I tell if I was charged a fee or not?
@_date: 2013-06-09 18:05:17
Plenty of them work but be careful because you'll probably find you pay more in fees to use those tiny bitcoins than you actually earned. There are ways to avoid fees of course but they're not guaranteed to work. Last time I tried a fee-less transaction it took 2 days to go through.

There's definitely a significant risk that any funds stored online will be compromised. I would go as far as to say that as time increases the probability approaches certainty. For myself I only keep the absolute minimum on exchanges that I need to trade with and I try to withdraw regularly into the relative safety of my bitcoin-qt.
@_date: 2013-07-31 11:31:20
Both sides have circumstantial arguments LBC has to decide which seems the more plausible. The bitcoins have to go to one of them or the other.
@_date: 2013-12-03 15:46:06
Yes but how did you get those bitcoins? You would have had to interact with an exchange or a website in order to buy them. And what will you do with those bitcoins? If they just magicked their way onto your paper wallet than that's anonymous but if you use them for anything then your identity is immediately revealed except in a few very edge cases such as meeting a random guy off the street and swapping them for cash - localbitcoins won't work though because they have your IP address.
Now, we can all concoct some sort of steps that you could take that would theoretically work but if the guy who run Silk Road couldn't do it then you have to admit that everyone's chances are pretty slim.

Yes, well if it's even possible to get the security tape then I suppose that will prove things one way or the other - if we're lucky enough that it covers the area that the trade was made. So I suppose there's no harm in waiting. I just find usually with these security tapes the recording is completely useless for proving anything.

Opposite. Every proper exchange in the world suspends trading for a short time, usually just 10minutes or so if there is a flash move in either direction.

btc-e has been 10% lower than mtgox ever since I started comparing them months ago. I think a lot of the difference is in the various fee structures and the difficulty of transferring money in or out.

I think its easy to quickly summarise why its better than paypal, better than gold and possibly a great currency that can be transmitted all the way across the world quickly and cheaply. I generally don't think its helpful to go into mining and all that stuff as its not really relevant to newcomers.
@_date: 2013-06-11 11:14:52
Well, wrt the Paypal comparison it's free (not 2% cheaper, 100% cheaper for most transactions) and there's no intermediary who needs your personal details and can lock your account whenever they like. If you want to stretch the truth to a certain degree you can also say its faster and anonymous. Plus, payments are irreversible which can be good or bad depending on which way you look at it. So I think it's more than just 2% cheaper fees in that regard.
@_date: 2013-12-02 18:36:19
Long winded analogies are always bad. Just say what you mean. The phrase "counterparty risk" is clear enough but if you want to explain further just give an example from the real world where counterparties have proved risky. Examples might include Bernie Madoff, Silk Road, that Chinese exchange that disappeared recently and even the devaluation of fiat currencies by the various central banks which act as a counterparty to the guarantee that your money is worth something.
@_date: 2013-05-29 06:33:21
I had this before except I never sent the extra and just kept refreshing. 10 or 20 minutes later it was accepted with the original amount and did not require the extra pennies from the price moving. Probably if I had just waited that time without desperately clicking around it would have eventually gone through on its own.
It tells you the balance in the target address so you know if anything has arrived. if the balance is 0 still then just keep waiting I guess.
@_date: 2013-08-25 09:58:58
They did decide to do that in the end but I think it could easily have gone either way.

Then we increase the divisibility even further. It would require a major change to the protocol which could be contentious but similar things have been done like when we updated the client to handle the split a few months ago so I think a consensus could easily be reached.

Aren't almost all your answers incorrect? 
1) Lots of countries have regulations about digital currency without specifically mentioning bitcoin. In most cases it would come under the regulations for barter. the US has regulations, or at least guidelines, that specifically mention bitcoin.  
3) Bitcoin can't be used in Walmart but then neither can Euros. However, there are plenty of shops where it can be used.  
4) Hard to answer, I suppose yes, depends on your definition of investment.  
5) Yes, true.  
6) Bitcoin is regulated by Fincen, isn't it? At least they've issued guidelines and taken action.

The bit I'm not clear about is that paypal transactions can be cancelled as much as 30 days (or is it more?) after the trade is completed. So does this protect me if I sell some bitcoins to someone who then goes on to get his paypal transaction reversed multiple weeks later?

Are you using a coinbase account or a raw bitcoin transaction? My first transaction was fine except it took 5 minutes to go through and I had to keep clicking on the Try Again button until it was accepted (not sure if I could have just walked away for five minutes and it still would have worked without all the clicking). It was very confusing though because it kept printing up that I needed to send different amounts.

My secondary advice is to store your coins locally in bitcoin-qt - do not use any third party app like armory or electrum as the long term risks are greater. The real best idea is to use a paper wallet but make sure you really understand it because there's some risk of losing all your money if you don't understand about what happens when you send a transaction that needs change.

Well, actually coins are constantly being lost due to wallets getting deleted or passwords forgotten so in fact there is "deflation" under your definition of the word (which is also wrong I think you'll find, inflation and deflation simple refer to what is happening to the price of goods regardless of the supply of money).
@_date: 2013-04-10 07:54:27
It's still extremely difficult to do live transactions in the real world. Imagine trying to buy a cup of coffee with bitcoins. Are you going to wait an hour for the transaction to be confirmed? Obviously not so there's some risk but even beyond that there's no real way to transfer money between people without a lot of complicated equipment.

Satoshi is a mystery because he has never spent any of his coins even though some people think they know which coins are his. As soon as he does anything with them we will have many clues about his identity - unless he does something semi-clever like throw them through a tumbler and hope no-one notices until the logs are lost.
This applies to a number of famous bitcoin thefts as well - the coins have simply never been spent so no-one knows who has them.
As for Silk Road, I think if anyone cared to they could track down and arrest everyone involved in it and everyone who ever used it. The good news is its way easier to catch drug dealers on the street right now so no-one has bothered trying.

@_date: 2013-12-06 17:15:41
No that's not the same. We resolve that by discarding one of the chains and then when all is said and done we know exactly which transactions are real and which are not. 
This "blocktree" seems to suggest that we can have two miners creating blocks at essentially the same time out of the same set of transactions and they get added onto the end of different branches and are both accepted at the same time. 
I suppose if we deal with it properly it's no big deal but it seems like there could be problems if one transaction is confirmed in two separate branches simultaneously.

There is a correlation between mining and the bitcoin price but the price leads and the hashrate follows. That is to say if bitcoins are worth less then inefficient miners drop out of the network because they are losing money if it rises then more people start mining because it is profitable. So from that I'd say the hashrate will stay higher even if the price falls now that we have ASICs. 
However I don't see any reason for the existence of ASICs to cause the BTC price to change. We still have the same number of coins printed every ten minutes, they are just spread out more or less depending on the number of miners.
If anything I think they are currently having an indirect negative effect because people are cashing out coins to pay for ASICs. (or rather ASIC producers are cashing out coins to pay their suppliers)
@_date: 2013-05-12 14:30:59

Maybe some sort of completely sealed plastic shell where you can only get to the private key by smashing the shell.

CNBC just reported that the Chinese central bank warned financial institutions should not buy or sell bitcoins due to the risks but that normal people are allowed to trade as long as they take on the risks themselves. 
So that seems bad at first but it's pretty much status quo. Obviously major banks shouldn't be investing heavily into bitcoins for now and this is more affirmation that even the central bank of China is OK with the Chinese  owning bitcoin.

One interesting feature is that if a large number of miners, say 90%  drop off at the same time then the next block will take hours or longer to generate instead of the usual 10 minutes and in a really bad scenario it could take years to get to the next difficulty recalculation. Worse still, while this is happening confirmations will also take hours and the whole network will grind to a halt and, in my opinion, bitcoin will die.

You're thinking in the right direction but as far as I know there's no way to stop a transaction once its started so even with the delay all that happens is you know you're going to lose all your money in 24 hours.

Agreed. Although, whether right or wrong, I would always just declare the profits that I had converted into dollars.

You just need one person in the whole country who wants to buy bitcoins and send you a bank transfer or an MPesa transfer or even a Western Union transfer (which I assume is cheaper when you stay within the country) or whatever else in exchange. That could be a person who needs to get money out of the country for whatever reason. Once the value has been transferred into Zimbabwe it's a lot easier to convert it than it would be from outside.

OK, we can't exactly do that with gold but we do know for sure that the number of forward contracts on gold far exceeds the actual amount of gold in the world so it seems like people don't really care to ensure this sort of information.
@_date: 2013-08-22 04:02:13
That's OK but we really need a better bitcoin frontend then. Right now if I send a transaction and the fee is too low I may have to sit and wait a week or more for it to go through and there's basically nothing I can do about it. We need to be able to increase the fee on a transaction if we want to hurry it along and also calculate the probable fee required to get an expected confirmation time.

It doesn't matter what the price is as such but the fact is that if everyone wants (or needs) to buy them then the law of supply and demand will cause the price to rise. If bitcoin is the new paypal or the new gold or the new reserve currency then there'll be so much demand for bitcoins that the price will inevitably reach that arbitrarily large power of ten.

Not really. When I bought my japaleno for $150 that was 20 bitcoins. Now those bitcoins are worth $2000. So there's almost no hope of ever recouping my losses. I don't regret a thing of course, I took a gamble and it didn't pay off.
@_date: 2013-08-05 06:20:02
You'll have to be more clever than that because every time you send bitcoins it combines inputs from multiple sources. Using normal clients it is not possible to prevent this.

On a related note, let's say I send a transaction with no fee in the future and it never gets accepted into the blockchani. What will happen to it? Can I ever confirm it won't go through or does it run the risk of being verified at some distant point in the future when I'm not expecting it?

One interesting aspect is if the hash rate drops significantly so that it takes months (years?) to mine those 2016 blocks then more and more people will stop hashing as the income decreases and it could lead to a hashing spiral where hardly anyone is wasting money hashing for blocks that will never be found.
@_date: 2013-06-08 19:14:30

OK, but yet again that's still only going to be helpful if Armory still works when you want your money. At least with normal paper wallets you just have to trust that there is some software out there that can accept your private and public key pair and be able to convert it into a wallet. For a live wallet that I am constantly using Armory sounds OK (although actually it basically never worked when I tried it presumably since I "only" have 8G of RAM) but for a long term store that you may not access for years it cannot be trusted.

We'll see. I'm certainly no expert but I really think the similarities with 2011 are hard to ignore. We popped from 3 to 30 then and 30 to ~300 this time. There was a ridiculous amount of media attention suddenly for all the wrong reasons. There was a sharp drop down after people started realising the highs were getting ridiculous and now we'll see a slow (multi week) drift down to 30 or 50 or so I imagine. Higher than before but not 10 or 5 times higher. I guess we'll see. TBH I sort of want the price to fall a bit now because I want to get in but I don't want to waste all those exchange fees. Long term I totally believe in bitcoin and I think in ten years or something we could well be trading 20,000 or some other ridiculous number but the current price is quite clearly hype driven and not based on reality but at best based on a speculation of what bitcoin could be in the future.

You can't do eGold backed by a warehouse full of real gold because the US government will seize your assets because of "terrorism" or possible "paedophiles" or whatever they can come up with to get ahold of all that free money. We've learned that lesson maybe half a dozen times already. This probably still applies if the gold is stored overseas.
There's an for more info but ChromaWallet seems to be the most developed client and it's in beta or possibly ArmoryX but neither of them are actually backed by their developers as full functioning.
I think the best way to go is to convince existing securities to move over to coloredcoins rather than trading where they are now. For example asicminer just has a list of addresses to send dividends and you have to email some guy to have him swap the owners over every time there is a trade. It's ridiculous. If you can think of a way to monetize your coloredcoins business the expected approach would be to float it on coloredcoins themselves backed by a promised dividend as a fraction of the profits. I actually don't know where most securities trade these days because the websites keep getting shut down by the SEC. But for example there's here  and for more info.

The blockchain can be verified and new blocks of transactions generated with a tiny fraction of the current amount of computing power. Bitcoin is computationally inefficient compared to credible alternatives that could achieve the exact same goals. All that hashing is not serving any purpose except to slow down the rate that blocks are generated. That could be done in other ways that do not require constant hashing. (although I confess I probably would not be able to think of one right now, maybe something to do with timestamps.)
@_date: 2013-05-27 14:40:59
Are you sure? I thought all transactions could be sent without a fee if you had a client willing to do so (i.e. not the reference client) and miners were willing to add it to blocks. Fees aren't enforced by the network protocol just by the options enforced in each individual client.
@_date: 2013-12-05 09:27:47

If you like the odds then go for it but most people want a consistent steady income they can rely on rather than waiting for something that may never happen. I suppose solo mining is a bit like gambling. Nothing wrong with that, just not what most people do.
@_date: 2013-12-18 13:35:09
A block is created by taking a number of unconfirmed transactions bundling them up and then trying to find a hash against them and the whole rest of the chain. If a transaction isn't included in that block then it still floats around the network and can be included in the next block. Generally speaking miners are incentivised to put transactions in their blocks by the transaction fee which the miner gets.

Exactly, it doesn't solve any anonymity issues at all. OK you collect all those payments one by one on unique addresses but when you go to pay your supplier then many of those payments get combined together in an unpredictable way and suddenly they taint each other. People don't seem to understand that if you collect 10 anonymous payments and 1 un-anonymous payment then as soon as you spend anything with those addresses you risk them all suddenly becoming un-anonymous. What's more the record of everything you did is in the block chain forever so there may not quite be enough data in it today to work out who you are but over time it will accumulate and you only need to make one mistake and your whole identity is blown open.

The problem with arbitrage is the huge cost and long delay in transferring dollars between exchanges. Sure, maybe you can make 10% or 20% right now but by the time you extract your dollars into your bank account and put them back into the new exchange it could be 2 weeks later and $30 of fees.

Yeah, so difficulty will go up 100x, I doubt power usage will go down to be honest. Unless there's a serious bottleneck in delivering ASICs to people who want them. The only reason power might go down, I suppose, is because people with gaming GPU's are not going to mine for fun anymore because its way more pointless.

but I have four confirmations and blockchain says it was a success. Of course, now the price has moved so if I retry it asks for a different amount and in any case still thinks that address has 0.
Any recommendations? It's only been a few minutes so I will just keep waiting but I was expecting it to be near instant.
Edit: Guess I spoke to soon. After half a dozen retries it went through. I suppose I learned my lesson not to use 0 transaction fees for stuff like this although, tbh, there's no way of adjusting it afterwards if you make a mistake.

I definitely agree with this in most normal markets. The problem here is that the bitcoin market is so small that there are many organisations and people that could manipulate the price if they wanted to.

Well then thank you very much to Just-Dice for increasing my investment by 7%

I think there's some guy out there with a huge number of bitcoins that is trying to get out and he just dumps a couple thousand every weekend in order to minimise losses because the book is so thin.

I think it's quite clear that the dividends will be smaller if their costs are a greater percentage of their income.

Is their website down or something because I tried searching for zipzap locations and literally none come up.
@_date: 2013-07-17 06:45:44
Are you just using icebergs? When you say "most prime moment" it sounds like you are just dumping the whole lot when you think the price has plateaued.
@_date: 2013-08-31 08:37:14
The funny thing is if we had time travel then bitcoins would be worthless because you could just go back with a copy of the blockchain and boom, suddenly you mined 1000 blocks in one second.
@_date: 2013-06-19 15:51:55
The difficulty comes in the selling part. If it's a currency like Bitcoin you could easily just run out of bitcoins to sell. Obviously if it was some other kind of currency where you could just create more whenever you like this would be less of an issue.
@_date: 2013-06-25 06:23:06
If you bought $1 million dollars worth right now on Mt Gox it would only push the price up by about $10. It would hardly be noticeable.
@_date: 2013-10-22 09:04:32
I wish I had access to a bitcoin ATM this is exactly what I'd do. Just throw all my spare change into it instead of having it sit around in jars.
@_date: 2013-08-31 20:22:43
Good point. There's other options though. Like, you have infinite time to spend brute forcing a private key by putting a computer into a time loop.

These have been available for, like, a month.

Just think, in a couple of years it could be 0 zettaFLOPS!
@_date: 2013-12-05 07:20:08
Talking of which is there any update on when 0.9 will come out? Any likelihood they will cut a release with the new fee calculations in it sooner? Is there any hope that we will be able to send transactions without fees and then add fees on later if confirmation is taking too long?
@_date: 2013-11-05 09:14:12
Unless your site is just a page of text that says "Don't store your bitcoins on a website" hopefully he doesn't take this advice.
@_date: 2013-12-05 09:16:06
Agreed. Obviously I don't want my bank investing heavily in bitcoins right now the risk is way too high. Not to mention I seriously doubt any of them are doing it anyway. So this is very much good news. 
Banks:- keep on doing what you're doing.   
People:- We approve of bitcoins and you have our blessing to continue trading.
@_date: 2013-06-28 10:54:18
Are you supposed to pay tax before you convert them into pounds? Or can you just wait until the next time you convert them back? Not sure whether it's right or wrong but I tend to treat these things like they don't exist from a tax perspective until I actually cash out again.

I think the British museum is quite familiar with how to protect valuable items that people want to steal. 
@_date: 2013-06-06 12:46:30
Oh that's interesting. So what happens to 0 fee transactions that can't be confirmed? The money is lost permanently? The main reason this is on my mind is that I tried it recently and all evidence leads towards it never confirming 
@_date: 2013-04-16 15:41:06
I think so. We've drifted up from the lows of the day but the general trend is down. I don't see any reason to assume that it will stop at 49.
@_date: 2013-11-28 09:52:13
I still buy 80% of all the humble bundles. I've paid for a VPN, a seedbox, bought reddit gold, donated to various private trackers I use and a very tiny amount of online gambling at just-dice and satoshi-dice.
In the next few days I plan to buy steam gift cards for the steam sale and I've contacted a modder who is requesting donations to see if he will accept bitcoins.
I use bitcoins pretty much wherever I can because it's so convenient and way more secure than giving randoms on the internet my credit card details. That said I'm a very big speculator and outside of my day to day bitcoin stash I have a "savings account" of bitcoins that I'm hoping will make me rich and able to retire.
@_date: 2013-06-11 15:28:02
I honestly don't understand why they pay dividends at all. They don't make any money from their shares trading now. I suppose the only way it makes sense is if they plan to issue more shares in the future then they would want to keep the price high.
@_date: 2013-07-08 12:30:35
It's obviously not a list of every order but we can assume that it is proportional. So if one third of orders on the website are noted as shipped then it is safe to assume that nigh on one third of ALL orders are shipped.
@_date: 2013-04-30 16:27:52
I guess I don't quite understand how this works. Does this protect me if I want to trade bitcoins for paypal and if so how? Do the "at risk" coins stay in the system for a month or two after every trade?
@_date: 2013-06-13 16:27:00
I have the same question. I estimate they'll ship my order (from late october) in the next week or two. I could slip in an upgrade now and be slightly better off.
One thing that concerns me a little is how are they achieving the extra 2GH/s? Are they just overclocking the 2 existing chips or adding an extra chip and sort of underclocking it a bit?
Now you remind me I think I'm probably going to do it but I still don't know if its worth it or not.
Edit: Bah, I upgraded. Not sure if its worth it or not but I bought a 300MH/s erupter for over twice what I just paid for 2GH/s so I guess that makes sense.
@_date: 2013-04-10 08:20:19
This is pretty feeble evidence but let's be honest. BFL may be scamming us nonetheless. I bought mine in August and still not a peep. I'm giving it about a 20% chance of ever being delivered at this point but I'm not angry, I knew the risk at the time.
@_date: 2013-07-23 14:28:57
So far just reddit gold and humble bundles. I've also bought a few bitcoin stocks and asics but that's it.

Traffic light auction sounds pretty plausible to me. Whichever side has the most people would win and if no-one is at a light then it can just stay red.
@_date: 2013-04-15 20:56:48
I generally agree with this although I think we could see 30-50 before the slide stops. I think it will drift down slowly over the course of the next month before starting its slow climb back up like it was before the bubble.
@_date: 2013-11-27 15:11:16
Same if it collapses down to near 0.

If blocks are not in a chain then how do we prevent one transaction from being in two different blocks? Does that even matter?
@_date: 2013-05-12 14:28:47
I understand gambling on satoshi dice - it can be good fun wondering whether you will win or whatever but I find it hard to believe that anyone with bitcoins is also dumb enough not to realise its all random chance. The odds are posted right on the website. I like to chuck 0.01BTC at the 1/64000 line every now and then but I'm not kidding myself that I have a system.
@_date: 2013-05-24 09:51:42
What's the news on the distributed blockchain idea? That seemed the most useful approach to me since then everyone can at least store some small portion of the blockchain and somehow verifications can still occur.
@_date: 2013-09-17 16:05:17
Well, you're no fun!

That's all very well and good until someone discovers a popular address generator has a flawed random number generator. All these estimates depend on the assumption that we are generating perfectly random numbers which is essentially impossible.
@_date: 2013-12-14 15:52:19
just-dice has had 344 million bets placed. So by your count a loss of 18 times in a row would have happened 344 times so far.

Armory is quite an elaborate way to step into paper wallets though don't you think? Not to mention it does not protect from the change address risk AT ALL. How can it when the problem is that payments cannot be sent from paper without managing change addresses properly. So far no-one has invented a piece of paper that can handle change addresses. My main concern with Armory is that the chance of it still existing in 10 years is nigh on zero and the chances that no exploitable bugs are ever found in it are pretty low too. bitcoin-qt has way more eyes on it and as long as bitcoin exists a compatible version of bitcoin-qt will exist.

Second Life is sort of similar to this in that it uses its own internal currency which is traded freely against the dollar although the owning company pegs the market to the dollar pretty tightly by buying or selling currency for dollars. All in all it works out great although SL is not so much a game as a virtual world. The other difference between SL and most games is that they openly welcome and encourage bots.

The IOU problem is actually a well supported solution to the problem of creating a distributed exchange. I don't that is necessarily something to worry about.
@_date: 2013-07-08 07:54:11
I honestly don't know why people are constantly asking them the same stupid questions about shipping updates. They're posting tons of information about what they are shipping and as long as this keeps working  then their updates are completely superfluous. We can see what has shipped in actual fact and we can estimate how soon our own order will be delivered so really anything more than that is totally unnecessary. I appreciate we have lots to complain to BFL about but information about shipping times is not one of them.
@_date: 2013-07-02 03:52:27


Is there a website which shows this sort of information?
@_date: 2013-05-28 19:09:37
OK, if you want to push the price up you can buy every bitcoin in the world and refuse to sell at anything except 300 (except if you tried this prices would shoot to the moon as coins become rarer, could be very weird if there was only 1 tradeable bitcoin anywhere and we were all buying things with a couple of satoshis).
But you seem to be implying shadowy figures from beyond the grave are trying to push the price down. In which case how do you propose they do that? They start by selling all the coins they have... then what? There's no way to short coins right now (beyond a few very illiquid and basically unused exchanges) so it doesn't matter how much money you have you can't reduce the price by buying and selling coins.
Now if your implication is that secret Lizard agents are pushing bitcoin prices up, then I guess let 'em at it because I like money.

Why do you say power consumption will go down? I would think as the network grows there will be more and more miners. I would say probably the total power used will always remain close to the price of electricity relative to the value of bitcoins. 
@_date: 2013-05-30 04:03:59
It's not all that bad we just need a single pool to mine dust for us and then we can all connect to it directly to make sure it gets transactions. I'm hoping one will turn up, maybe Eligius.

Right, if you want to spend some I suggest sending the whole balance to a wallet running in something reliable like bitcoin-qt. Spend from there and then return the remainder to a new paper wallet. It's a bit finicky but paper wallets are for long term storage so it shouldn't be a regular problem.
