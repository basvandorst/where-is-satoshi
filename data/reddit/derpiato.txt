Right, but miners can process transactions without fees at the moment, because they're earning money from mining. When mining becomes unprofitable, they'll have to start charging fees.

@_date: 2014-07-27 08:24:18
As a second point, what you're proposing here (banks must hold on to all demand deposits) isn't a hugely fundamental change to system. 
Banks still relend/create credit based on the other deposits, so a GFC like credit crunch is still possible.
IMO better regulation and oversight of loans is what's required, and yeah, that's were the blockchain could help.

@_date: 2014-10-05 08:41:39
What's different, is that this time it treats the $250 bubble, and the $1200 bubble, as same bubble... which makes sense. 
So no, in both individual bubbles , the price dropped to a value much higher than its pre-bubble price, which lead people to say 'Look it's still up!' 
But the single bubble theory suggests that we're only in capitulation phase now.

@_date: 2014-07-27 07:50:46
Being an investor/shareholder is a different risk to lending. 
ie. With lending, I lend the bank $10000 for a year, and they agree to give me $11000 in one years time. The bank lends this out to someone, maybe they make $3000 interest on it, maybe they lose the capital, either way, the bank has to pay me $11000 back, that's the contract. This is very predictable for me, good. 
If I were to buy $10,000 of shares in the bank, then, when I want to get my money back, I have to find someone to sell my shares to. The value of the shares depends on how well the bank is doing at the time (whether they lent they money someone who can pay them back or not). So this is problematic, someone people want a predictable investment. 
@_date: 2014-08-15 06:38:55
Alright, that's fair enough. But I think it's just a subset of 'the less money you make, the more you spend on living expenses'. 
@_date: 2014-09-04 05:20:28
Right, but transaction fees aren't always going to be this cheap. Currently they're subsidised by mining rewards. 
@_date: 2014-07-27 10:20:06
Tax has always been a thing. 
@_date: 2014-09-15 10:16:39
Doesn't it often take 10 minutes or so for a payment to be confirmed?
@_date: 2014-09-18 23:36:29
Here are five objections that you shouldn't put to rest:
1. Wasteful verification algorithm. By design the Bitcoin verification algorithm requires miners to brute force solve an arbitrary problem. This is an unnecessary cost for a transaction processing network. 
2. Pressure toward centralisation. Related to (1) - because verification is computationally expensive, it favours miners with specialised hardware, and is not economically viable for the Joe Sixpack to mine. (Yes Joe Sixpack can mine, but his mining effort is drop in the ocean). 
3. Verification isn't instant, not good for point of sale payments. 
4. Transaction fees won't necesserily be cheap forever. Currently they are subsidised by a 25 BTC mining reward, but as this decreases, miners will need to charge transaction fees to cover their costs. 
5. Bitcoins are destructible. The reason gold has been a store of value for the last 4000 or so years, is 1.) It is universally rare, 2.) It is remarkably resilient (it doesn't rust). One can be sure that a 1 kilo block of gold will still exist in 100, 1000 years time. A bitcoin on the otherhand, a key can be lost or the network itself can change, or cease existing for all practical purposes. 
@_date: 2014-09-15 12:11:59
I don't think anyone would be insane enough to take on that bet. (It would be worth $20 trillion ). 
@_date: 2014-07-27 20:50:02
Why would you lend your bitcoin out and risk losing it?
@_date: 2014-07-27 06:27:08
So you're saying that banks _will_ be allowed to relend money, (ie not 100% reserve), so long as they have consent of the depositor. 
Isn't the consent implicit? Ie. the bank is paying interest on the deposit, which they're able to do, because they're earning more interest than that by lending it to someone else.
If the depositor doesn't want their money lent out, then does that mean they have to pay a safe keeping / account fee? (Bank fees suck enough as they are). 
@_date: 2014-10-01 06:17:09
And then you could show them dealing with the stress of having bitcoin stolen instead!
@_date: 2014-07-27 07:43:02
Inflation of bitcoin is possible too.
Here's the scenario:
A bitcoin banking service springs into existence. It provides an browser based, and smart app, takes care of security for you, _provides insurance against bitcoin theft_, has a network of trusted vendors etc. You can see how people might want to use this service.
You deposit your bitcoin into this service (much like you would on Mt Gox etc), and it displays your balance. 
At any time you can also withdraw your bitcoin to a proper bitcoin wallet.*
Now making transactions _within_ this system doesn't require an actual bitcoin transaction. Transactions  It's only when a user _withdraws_ there bitcoin that a bitcoin transaction needs to take place.
So in this system, the bank could, if they wanted, just create bitcoin on people books (ie. creating debt). 
This itself can be inflationary - all of a sudden you have extra 'bitcoin' floating around (they're not real bitcoin, but for intents and purposes they are! if people are willing to accept them). 
Now ofcourse, this all falls down if you get a credit crunch.
But the point is - there's nothing in the bitcoin protocol that prevents this happening either.
@_date: 2014-10-03 23:38:25
Unless they're doing it to be ironic. 
@_date: 2014-08-15 05:21:33
Inflation doesn't _actually_ cost the average consumer much at all. Wages tend to rise with inflation, and we keep our more serious savings in shares, or deposits earning interest.

Yeah... this I think it's semantic debate whether you call it fraud or not. 
Essentially when you balance says 10BTC, it is 'I promise to give you 10BTC whenever you ask for it'.
Similarly, if a business takes out a loan from a bank, they're saying 'I promise to pay this loan back in one years time' or whatever. But the business might fail, and go bankrupt, that is _always_ a risk that the bank is aware of. If the business does fail, that's not fraud. It's fraud if the business was deceiving the bank in someway. 
But that banks lend your money out to other people, isn't outlandish or deceptive. It's fundamentally what a bank is.

On the right: Person is at home, they download a wallet and get started while the person on left is still entering the bank. They get the email and transfer the money to their Mom's bank account, instantly get and email saying thanks! When the left screen is showing the person waiting, show the person on the right looking frustrated, with a balance of 0 BTC and posting on a technical forum 'Lost my bitcoin! Help!'.

Credit creation is only a bad thing when the credit created is for bad loans (ie loans that can't be paid back). 
If the loan _is_ being paid back (ie it was a successful business venture), then that's a good thing, it allows business to take place, adding wealth to the world.
The GFC is an example of bad loans being created, where risky loans were created to buy into a housing bubble (further fueling the bubble), essentially a 'hot potato' game where the person holding the loans at the time the bubble burst, loses. Also, there was deception where investors where buying packages of debt not being made aware it's full of bad loans.

Right, so here's the thing. 
Sure, it's possible that what you say is what would happen. But that's not *guaranteed*. That's based on human behaviour - who knows that incentives exist in the future?
For example, it's possible that retailers and banks would have their bitcoin security dealt with by some third party source, who has an arrangement with miners, and so they go along with it. 
So: long story short: - It's not guaranteed that there will be only 21m bitcoin in the future. 
@_date: 2014-10-02 08:29:21

Both of these are fair points. 
(Though one isn't mandated to use a bank account for conventional money, we have them because they're convenient, and our employers probably won't pay us in 
So firstly: 'Why would people start using a Bitcoin bank?'. 
It depends on what direction Bitcoin takes. eg. Whether it replaces our current currencies entirely as store of value, or whether it's just used for facilitating transactions (ie, if you want to send money overseas, so you buy bitcoin, send it, and they transfer it back to their currency of choice).
I can give a few scenarios for a bitcoin bank being used:
- A bank as secure way to hold Bitcoin. One of the major issues with bitcoin at the moment is the security of coins. Perhaps fine if you're technically minded and put the time and effort in, but for joe public, it's a major barrier/risk.  A service that takes care of this for you would appeal to Joe Public.
- A secure way to spend bitcoin. Another problem from a consumers POV is that once you've spent bitcoin, you can't recover it, meaning that it's good for operating scams. A bitcoin bank could offer a safer payment service, something similar to paypal, where it guarantees payments to vendors on its networks. Essentially you can imagine a 'network of trusted vendors', where payments to these vendors occurs automatically, and is guaranteed by the bank, and payments to vendors not in the network are not. 
- Earning interest on savings. If bitcoin is used more as a store of value for everything (ie you keep your savings in it), then people will want to earn interest on it, and banks would be the safest way of doing that.
Certainly in its current climate I wouldn't trust a bitcoin bank, but in the future where bitcoin is used everwhere, one might. 
@_date: 2014-09-23 03:17:46
I think it's usually because they don't carry much cash in the drawer. Places that handle a lot of cash, like supermarkets and petrol stations, regularly drop their cash into a secure drop box.

I just thought I'd mention that inflation isn't solely due to central banks printing money. 
I think yes - it's fair to call printing money a tax of sorts. 
But not all inflation is due to printing money. 
Inflation is complicated, but it can be due the price of something genuinely going up (for example, the price of oil, as it gets harder to extract), or the money supply expanding,  (due to lending not printing money).
@_date: 2014-10-02 07:22:51

Right I'm meaning from a monetary policy perspective, people might want to inflate the currency, to encourage economic growth. 
Now we disagree all we like about whether steady low inflation is good monetary policy or not, but the fact is, a good chunk of people do think that is good monetary policy,  so it's conceivable that people will want to use it in the future. 
Now personally, I think that bitcoin won't become the standard currency for everyday transactions, so it won't be relevant. Rather, if it doesn't die completely, it'll be used just as a means of international transfers before being converted back into local fiat. 
@_date: 2014-07-27 08:11:56


This is moot. 
On one hand, if the money supply is fixed, and the economy grows, then it the value of each unit of currency increases (deflation). 
On the other hand, if the money supply is increasing (through credit), then you can have inflation.

Man, bitcoin is so easy to use. Much safer and more reliable than traditional banking.
@_date: 2014-09-03 22:44:15
No there are transaction fees as well:
Basically - it looks like transaction fees aren't 'compulsory', but miners can opt to not process your transaction if the fee isn't included.

Alright, so your grandma gets a bitcoin wallet, you can send her bitcoin easily enough.
But then what?
How does she turn that into goods, in a way that has the same security, convenience, etc, as the bank transfer?

That's what my point was about. Gold is definitely going to be around in 100 years. Bitcoin.... maybe not. 
Granted that same objection applies to fiat, but point is more that Bitcoin can't really be considered as safe as gold. The laws of physics aren't like to change any time soon.
@_date: 2014-07-27 09:57:33
What I was more getting at, is that a lot of the Bitcoin proponents argue that Bitcoin is somehow immune to some of the nuances of traditional fiat, but it's not. 
@_date: 2014-07-27 09:33:02
So, yes. _It is_ possible to fractional reserve bank with bitcoin.

This is good news for bitcoin.

The thing with QE, is that you're meant to sell the assets you built with the QE, and then burn the money, once the economy has recovered.

It's actually good news for bitcoin though.

All of that and it can only process 7 transactions per second.

I'm not sure how 5 transactions a second and a ridiculous carbon footprint is solid.

Come on, don't play silly with the definition. 
I'm meaning 'Is the current value of the BC due to it being a bubble, or is it's long term value going to much higher than it currently is?'. 
@_date: 2013-06-07 23:56:36
A currency isn't very good if its value is easily destroyed and you have to keep adopting a new one.
And if someone did do this, wouldn't a lot of legitimate bitcoin holders lose their wealth?

What's so shocking about that? 
Credit allows a business idea to take place, before the person or institution has saved the money for it. *Credit allows business to happen*.

Do you have any kind of source or calculation for this?
@_date: 2013-11-19 06:41:23


Banks take the risk that the person they're lending money to, isn't going to pay them back.
You can do fractional reserve banking with bitcoin as well.
@_date: 2013-11-29 08:52:52
How are you going to feel when (if) it crashes? TBH this is something I would be reasonable casual about, but perhaps that's my reserved kiwi attitude. 
@_date: 2013-11-17 06:21:16
That these kinds of videos are so popular in bitcoin circles, concerns me. 
@_date: 2013-05-23 10:30:44
So you don't really have a problem with fractional reserve banking?
@_date: 2013-05-21 08:42:36
yeah, I think this is pretty important. For bitcoin to 'work' people have to be actively making the effort to contribute to the bitcoin economy.
@_date: 2013-04-06 08:10:24
Great answer, thanks.

tbh this puts me off bitcoin a bit. Wouldn't it be really quite easy to take over the bitcoin network (if you had the money)?
@_date: 2013-06-13 11:13:49
For A I wouldn't argue so much the 'no reversals or transactions fees', (coz bitcoin is a hassle and isn't risk free).
I would focus on 'Generate a buzz about the cafe, draw in a new niche crowd'.

But you can lend bitcoins that people have lent to you. 
@_date: 2013-04-09 20:27:15
Good post.
Here's what I've been thinking. 
Short of something catastrophic happening to bitcoin (bug being exploited, mt gox hacked, government intervention), let's assume that it is currently a bubble. 
So it crashes down to $20. But, given that we've seen it's heights, who isn't going to buy in at $20? $30? $50? $100?
In the long run, the value of the bitcoin depends on much it's going to be adopted. If more and more retailers do start using it, then it's value is warranted. 
@_date: 2013-05-11 14:39:08
Yeah, you can't expect these guys to know everything there is about bitcoin. His job is to be a bank industry representative, not an expert on bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-11-17 06:20:27
What about banks as credit institutions? *Credit is good*. 
@_date: 2013-05-28 11:44:25
Supply and demand. If supply stays constant and demand increases, the price goes up.
@_date: 2013-11-17 06:25:41


No they can't. 
For a system that requires 10% reserve, from an initial deposit of 10 gold coins, the bank can lend and relend those 10 gold coins out to create a debt of 100 gold coins, and no more.

I don't mean about the money lost, if you've been crowing about how successful you are... and then you're not it's a bit embarrassing. 
That said - it looks like you'll probably return a profit even if it does crash, so cool. 
@_date: 2013-06-07 13:50:21


The concern isn't so much that someone would take over the bitcoin network to make money for themselves, but to destroy the bitcoin economy. 
[I asked how much computing power/money it would take to take over the bitcoin network in a thread a while back]( but didn't get a sufficient answer. The number $40million was bandied about, but without calculations or explanation. 
Edit: Apparently:


If Bitforce SC was a shipping product, it would cost $2500 for 50 GH/s. That would mean that 1,800 would be required to replicate the hashing power already in existence. Total retail cost $4,498,200.

@_date: 2013-05-23 08:53:52
So long as there is no run on the bank it would be fine. 
But: as has been pointed out, the main reason people have bank accounts, isn't to earn interest, but just as a convieneient place to store money. Bitcoin already does this.
The reason you'd be investing in a bitcoin bank, would be sol-ey to earn interest on it. 
@_date: 2013-08-09 06:20:46
Here's my stack exchange question.
@_date: 2013-05-23 08:38:40
Are you suggesting that when you deposit money, the bank should just leave it there and not make any use of it until you return?
