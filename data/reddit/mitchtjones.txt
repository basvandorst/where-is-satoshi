I always say it’s impossible for an individual to own Bitcoin. It belongs to the private key and whoever knows the key just has access to it.

How? Bank or card?

He should just put away the cig money everyday (into a separate bank acc or a jar or something depending if it’s physical or not) and then actually buy the coins at the end of the week or month or so. That way he wouldn’t be slaughtered by fees.
Or wait for Robinhood crypto and feeless trading :)

You will pay a small percentage fee when depositing USD into Coinbase. It’s something around 4% I think with credit card and half that with bank deposit. I think its $5 flat with a wire transfer though.
You will then, depending on conditions, pay a very small &gt;1% USD fee when buying on GDAX. Google ‘GDAX fees’ and understand the difference between makers and takers. It’s possible, if you do it right, to pay no fees as a maker.
Because GDAX is a bro, you will pay no fee when transferring the Bitcoin to your wallet. There is a fee, mind you, but GDAX covers it for you.
Any subsequent BTC transfers once it’s in your wallet will cost a small, flat rate of BTC depending on the network at the time.

Congratulations, but you should probably delete this post or even stop using this Reddit account.
The beauty of Bitcoin is that it’s *yours*; one of the major drawbacks is that that means it’s also your responsibility. If someone “hacks” your wallet, they can take it all and no government or bank can get it back.
You’ve essentially just posted an advertisement to one of the world’s largest websites that the first person who can “hack” you gets $30,000...
