After speaking with my mother, who also is unfamiliar with this topic, she has stopped my father from donating even further. I will continue to try to educate my god-father in regards to crypto currency but at this time he is not hearing anything i have to say that is negative about OneCoin at all. I'm definitely going to try not to say "I told you so" once it does eventually crashes.

I will make sure they listen to that asap. Thanks

I may need to contact the authorities but I feel that my godfather was brainwashed by these people. I'm going to a seminar this Sunday out here for the first time to see if I can at least get parents money back. If that doesn't work out the authorities might be my next step.

Yeah from what I understand he invested at least $100,000.00. I highly doubt he's saying that to recruit people, but there's always a chance. Onecoin does pay a recruitment bonus of 10% for each person they bring in and a certain percent of that goes back to onecoin!! wtf

Thank you! Sending this now

I will. I just feel like he's fucked. My father told me that you don't sign nothing in regards to obtaining these coins.

I'm going this Sunday to see what is going on and to see if I can get my parents money back..which I doubt. I can give you the address of where OneCoin is meeting up. I know for a fact it's a 2 p.m. 
@_date: 2016-07-20 00:11:29


I honestly feel he doesn't realize what is going on! All we do is text in regards to this whole situation. We've spoken about it breifly a few times on the phone and he seems completely brainwashed by these people at OneCoin. He invited me to go to a seminar this Sunday so hopefully something good can come from that.

I don't even know what Karma really is..I'm only on reddit for good articles to read and funny comments...I'm going to a small OneCoin seminar in Renton, WA this Sunday. I can give an update. I have no reason to lie.
@_date: 2016-07-21 16:10:15


Yes! Thank you! Thank is exactly what i'm battling with everyday with my godfather and father...They are so clueless and when I break it down to them in laymen terms they just seem like they are in denial.

Anyone in the Seattle area that would like to check out these Scammers. They will be in Renton, WA in a building across the street from City Hall and Sam's Club at 2pm. I will post the exact address once I obtain it. 
@_date: 2016-07-20 00:12:11
Thank you! I will pass this along

The shitty thing about this from what I understand is that they are locked in for 24 months and they as well don't know a thing about how crypto works other than what OneCoin puts in their heads.
@_date: 2016-07-19 01:12:48
I'm really going to try to attempt to get their money back..but the shitty thing about this is that their money is locked into this stupid investment for 24 months!
