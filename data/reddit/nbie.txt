Fixed. Thanx for the find :)

Why not read the article? Coins can, and have been, frozen, by custodians. Whether they are "yours" is another question.

Nah, they said "Bitcoin surges up 2.7 %, ALONG WITH "classic safe havens", according to the quote I heard. They did not refer to Bitcoin as something classic.
@_date: 2015-08-19 09:29:28
Reading Satoshi:s white paper. The word "decentralized" occurs 0 times. The decentralization is a result of the protocol, the network allows nodes to come and go as they wish, accepting the longest chain as proof of what happened while they were gone. 
The network is still open to anyone who wants to connect. There will be new players with new tech adding big chunks of hashpower going forward. The "decentralization rate" will continue to jump up and down and shift its power among participators, just like the exchange rate. Running a node is not a given "right". Security costs. If any gov successfully manipulated hashpower it'd be noticed quickly (as the network is open and transparent). And we don't need THAT many nodes.
@_date: 2016-02-23 10:09:34
Most of this is based on the premise that anonymous accounts are more convincing than the known actors in the space, but it's the other way around. Funnily enough for a pseudonymous network it is actually the known actors people listen to the most (i.e known developers, miners, merchants, exchanges, advocats etc).
@_date: 2015-09-23 06:53:22
Yes, check with your local bank and/or brokerage, or sign up with a global broker such as Interactive Brokers

PoS is a dead end as it rewards the already rich, also insecure. Read this: 
@_date: 2015-09-24 09:14:38
IF you want to read something longer, I've written this dismissal of a PoS-based coin called Neucoin, but the conclusions there are applicable on all PoS coins (and any altcoin invented to date, with the exception of Namecoin, and maybe Truthcoin, we'll see)... 
@_date: 2015-09-23 11:41:18
Let's just discuss the main point (and separate the 21.co-question): "rewards the rich". You can do PoW without having a stake, you can not in PoS - agree?
@_date: 2015-09-23 06:55:30
More info: 
@_date: 2015-09-23 06:54:33
There are many different ideas on how to secure a chain, but only PoW has been "proven" to work, yet. And no, there are other ways of getting into mining (just look at 21.co) and there will be many new ideas on how to contribute to PoW going forward.
@_date: 2015-09-23 06:52:25
PoW has amazing development paths forward, with many competitors of different types coming into the arena, just look at 21.co... While PoS is built specifically to reward those who already have.
@_date: 2015-09-24 09:15:57
AND remember there is a very high risk of a pool getting 51% in any PoS system. Creators of PoS systems say they can avoid pools. Won't happen. There is no way to avoid pools. Bitcoin is the only way forward for the value-transferring mechanism.
@_date: 2015-09-24 08:25:09
And, in PoW a new actor CAN startup to compete, in PoS they can not after a little while...
@_date: 2015-09-24 08:15:43
There's been several well thought-through analyses of how PoS would evolve and it'll inherently turn the few richest to a very small group who owns it all... And, according to this very elegant run-down by Andrew Poelstra (Nakamoto Institute) PoS won't work technically either:  - just to name a few
@_date: 2015-09-18 13:24:21
Naturally the US authorities, who "owns" the most powerful currency on earth today, do not want to facilitate this new competitor. The US stronghold on today's world reserve currency might actually hurt itself as other jurisdictions don't have the incumbent's incentive to prop up the old paradigm. Paradoxical huh?

Cool, please publish yourself, there is too much of Krugman in the media space.
@_date: 2015-11-03 21:33:16
I was thinking the exact same thing earlier today, but about Paul Vigna/Michael Casey. Actually, you should not listen to any one "expert". To find the truth you need a multitude of sources. I blogged about it in more length (shameless self-promotion) at: 
@_date: 2015-10-06 21:04:27
Actually, this is a very simplified comparison for uninformed journalists who keep repeating this untrue mantra. In the case of "Bitcoin developers", they decide themselves (or their bosses) if it's worth paying for their desks/computers. This post is comparing the Bitcoin *network* to the cost of only the offices of one bank, to show how ridiculous statements from "journalists" like  ( are, he who instigated the last round of myth sharing...
@_date: 2015-10-12 19:35:24
Hmm, we'll see but I just don't think they can agree (all of them, in all the countries). It'll be shaky going forward in any case (the fiat system is already very shaky, with its overblown QE and FRB).
@_date: 2015-10-12 13:53:36
No, Ethereum is great, a part from the fact that it's not decentralized (if Vitalik says jump investors must jump (to the next PoS chain)), so it's not secure. Should merge with bitcoin or watch rootstock.io or similar initiatives win the day. And I've actually been involved in crypto much longer than I've worked at this particular company. A person can have views independently of his/her employer you know, even though they might align in some instances (so maybe it's the other way around, the attraction is based on similar views, the views are not influenced by commercial goals). It may even be that those views are commercially advantageous for both parties, as they are based in reality...

@_date: 2015-10-02 19:02:59
Well, I wasn't trying to guess exactly *how* it would've been anticipated, just that it should have been clear to Satoshi, at least that's how I interpret his comments.
@_date: 2015-10-15 07:04:41
Late reply, but I'd say the comparison falters if you compare the blockchain to a single human (as we have lousy memory, the blockchain perfect), but if you compare it to DNA you'd be a little bit closer IMHO (if so RNA are the "bitcoins").
@_date: 2015-10-06 13:36:32
In my personal opinion digging gold out of the ground is an energy waste, but views on that differs of course.
@_date: 2015-10-12 13:57:33
Agree on both.
@_date: 2015-10-07 05:19:10
Krugman is a laughable economist. Didn't he also say that Internet would have no bigger effect on the economy and the world than the fax machine? Did he foresee 2008 disasters? He is a perfect example of a sheep in front of a herd running towards a (fiscal) cliff, cheering the people chasing them, saying we need to print even *more* fiat money out-of-thin-air.
@_date: 2015-10-06 13:34:45
Yes, actually only their *offices*.
@_date: 2015-10-07 07:58:01
Thanx :)
@_date: 2015-10-12 13:17:22
PoW is part of the chain, human greed another, laws of nature a third, cryptography and the fact that you can keep the network open to anyone are other mechanisms contributing to the results, it's a game where the sum is larger than its parts.
@_date: 2015-10-06 21:05:40
The question is if they are really serving their customers or themselves - who is making the biggest profits?
@_date: 2015-11-03 21:50:03
About the limb there on the left; it's mine. "Proof-of-thumb"; 
@_date: 2015-10-12 14:02:58
You are not aware of the fact that Ethereum is using a form of PoW right now, because it has not solved the problems of using a PoS system? And that they plan to leave the current chain and restart on a new PoS chain when those are solved? So when Vitalik says "I'm ready now, we can all change to the new fork now" everybody must do that, or it's difficult to call it Ethereum anymore...
@_date: 2015-10-07 12:20:08
Thanks, I'm actually working on presenting that idea in the most condensed way possible. Coming up. Although it is not _my_ idea, Satoshi Nakamoto is the visionary here, we just need to understand him/her/they.
@_date: 2015-10-12 14:18:40
What do you know about my knowledge? I've studied Bitcoin and altcoins in detail full-time since early 2011. What part is misinformed in my reasoning then?
@_date: 2015-10-07 12:09:15
How would that differ from today's "on-ramps" from fiat compared to the Interledger proposal? You still need an expensive guard checking your ID and that your fiat money is not counterfeit when moving to any cryptocurrency, if you don't want to break AML/KYC laws. If you want to move between systems/ledgers (altcoins that is) today you can just use Shapeshift.
@_date: 2015-10-07 18:39:47
Alright, it's just different definitions, and it doesn't really matter. Bitcoin does not care.
@_date: 2015-10-12 14:33:44
Only until that bankchain is hacked.
@_date: 2016-05-04 16:36:19
Yeah, I called it in December last year, not rocket science really:  
@_date: 2015-10-06 14:12:20
They also inflate your money by FRB and extending home loans, require bailouts and increase the general cost of living through their own salaries, to just name a few counter-arguments. Most of those services can be decentralized so everybody can profit from them.
@_date: 2015-10-06 13:44:08
Of course better energy efficiency of the ASICs involved translates to better security in combination with the total energy consumption, when you compare the efficiency of the network today with a year ago.
@_date: 2015-10-07 04:23:50
Bitcoin is arguably the most practical type of money ever invented.
For example; bitcoins are highly suitable for:
• Online transactions
• Face-to-face mobile transactions
• Machine-to-machine transactions
• International remittances
• Secure savings
• Back-up
However, Bitcoin is much more than just "money". Bitcoin's network and technology (the "Blockchain") enables: 
• Start-up innovation (an address is all you need, bank account optional)
• Autonomous Trading Entities / Decentralized Apps / Corporations (DAC:s)
• Proof-of-existence services (timestamping)
• Multi-signatory contracts, wills, insurance agreements
• Borderless value transfers
• Transparent governance
@_date: 2015-10-12 13:30:08
What do you mean? There is not "one truth", that's the first lesson in journalism. It depends on your point of view. For what else in the known universe does the concept of "truth" mean anything? What's been backtracked? I've added a " on both sides of "Truth" for clarification, that's not backtracking, that's clarifiation. At least that how I see the "truth" ;)
@_date: 2015-10-07 13:30:45
How will the "connectors" be secured? By keeping secrets (pass phrases) or by using energy? If the former it can be hacked, if the latter then Bitcoin is already better.
@_date: 2015-10-09 07:35:33
So if one or two connectors get hacked (which is bound to happen) then people will still trust the rest of the system, you say?
@_date: 2015-10-06 13:33:06
No, there are no alternatives, and there won't be. Read the article, especially the last part after "Energy = Security". 
@_date: 2015-10-07 04:40:30
Yes, and I have only corrected his factual errors, I did not comment on any of his views.
@_date: 2015-10-06 20:38:13
Securing the network and earning bitcoins are the same things (for miners). It happens simultaneously thanks to the proof-of-work process. You could not have the same security in an *open* and decentralized network without putting guards into place, which would increase costs again, and create a target for hackers (that's the banking industry for you, and they get hacked all the time, they are just very quiet about it). Power + time = security, in this case, and as long as you have more power than anything else, you are more secure than anything else.
@_date: 2015-10-06 12:30:08
Bank of America's *offices* Alone...
@_date: 2015-10-06 15:24:38
It's as stupid as the journalists arguing that mining is wasteful, that's why I wanted to do that comparison. If you really understand things there are no comparisons. BoA customers are dealing with debt and transactions that arent finalized often for weeks, while Bitcoin is commodity-based.
@_date: 2015-10-14 05:58:04
It's already known he left Bitpay (he said so himself).
@_date: 2015-10-08 13:19:01
As, in the future...
@_date: 2015-10-06 20:47:41
Actually, Bitcoin will change the face of the corporate world much more than you are imagining in your reply here. Everything than can be decentralized will be decentralized. There are no natural laws stipulating that the current paradigm has to last, at all. read this for instance; 
@_date: 2015-10-08 08:23:24
Are you sure you know the intention? "Stress tests" come and go. Tx fees are relevant to some people.
@_date: 2015-10-20 12:10:49
If not Bitpay then maybe:  (or just use local wallets on phones used by the staff, set up dedicated addresses, to help make bookkeeping easy, here are a few suggestions:  )
@_date: 2015-10-06 15:36:36
Well, not really as you can not compare the debt-based transactions of the fiat system (that often take weeks to finalize) with the *real* transfers in the commodity-based system Bitcoin. Read the full article (the last part explains the real value).
@_date: 2015-10-12 13:24:11
Well, those "bankchains" probably won't work at all in the longer run, check Datavetaren's reasoning for instance; 
@_date: 2015-10-08 14:08:14
Looking through your commenting ( you don't seem to be a super-great source of info yourself... (mostly swear words) ;) - but why not come with an actual fact for an argument instead of trolling-type nonsense (not meaning this as rude, just wondering what part of the info you're not happy with)?
@_date: 2015-10-14 05:42:10
I just updated w/ speculation no. 1.
@_date: 2015-10-12 18:50:19
A lot of words, sounds good, but no - banks don't trust each other AT ALL today, why would they do so suddenly now just because there's a technology called blockchain?
Even more important; corporations will have a hard time competing with AI-driven blockchains, smart contracts etc, even corporations will become decentralized (everything that can be will be).
@_date: 2015-10-12 14:29:00
No, PoS depends on keeping secrets, to put up a stake (by definition), I argue that PoS can't be as secure as securing information with power (by definition). 
And why want a PoS system anyway, distribution of wealth can never be as good as with PoW. Our current fiat system is in effect PoS (where poor don't have the same options to stake compared to the rich), and we want something better.
@_date: 2015-10-06 14:25:45
Yes, that's already happening. 
@_date: 2015-10-07 04:28:24
Why don't you read the article you are commenting on? It's not about the interpretation of money, but about a "economics professor" who knows nothing about the things he is writing about.
@_date: 2015-10-07 04:26:13
Why don't people here on Reddit actually read the articles they are commenting on?
@_date: 2015-10-12 13:52:30
Yeah, but if you want to use that analogy; but intranets are usually "pegged" to the Internet (using tcp/ip for instance, not building their own Internet to run an intranet), like other blockchains can be pegged to the BTC blockchain for trustworthiness, and offer *other* mechanisms than value-transferring (as that part is already covered by the "base" chain)
@_date: 2015-10-10 07:25:33
And now? I don't want your eyes to hurt.
@_date: 2015-10-06 14:10:27
Looking forward to that post, as "rewriting history" in the Bitcoin network is practically impossible (too costly) even today. But please explain your reasoning on how you'll be able to go back and rehash all those blocks.
@_date: 2015-10-06 13:34:24
It's probably less, this calculation assumes miners use 0.55 w/GHs on average, read the article.
@_date: 2015-10-14 06:51:41
That's funny as a speculation, but nah, speed of light means delay of cirka 3 - 22 minutes due to orbits, so; sidechain ("Marscoin"?)
@_date: 2015-10-12 18:51:29
Yes, Paul gets it, and truthcoin is a very interesting development.
@_date: 2015-10-06 14:27:00
Yes, that's a good idea, but it's really hard to get those numbers from the impenetrable (information-wise, hackers steal money from the banks *all the time*) fiat system, just like with the federal reserve system. If you have any numbers on the SWIFT system's energy consumption please get back with a source.
@_date: 2015-10-07 04:25:07
The "overwhelming majority of economists" did not foresee any of the last decade's financial disasters and does not even get Bitcoin. They are actually harmful to the economy as they protect the status quo by defending the current paradigm (which creates economic divide, the 1% and violence).
@_date: 2015-10-06 20:45:16
You are just repeating myths journalists have published, actually less than 5% of transactions in the Bitcoin network can be linked to anything illegal (if you don't count gambling as illegal).
@_date: 2015-10-07 18:38:26
You do not have to interpret it as an attack, I like the idea of Ethereum and would like to see it succeed, that's why I point out the weaknesses and propose a solution. But it may be too late already: rootstock.io.
@_date: 2015-10-12 13:15:57
If you read the text you might get it together, it is not miners who decide on the truth, it's decided by the humans using the network (picture an AI robot stamping every move into the chain with GPS coordinates and 360 pictures, that's more trustworthy (to humans) than just a centralized Microsoft database saying the same thing)
@_date: 2015-10-14 05:37:56
I've asked, waiting... (but he just tweeted "Hello, NYC").
@_date: 2015-10-02 14:41:01
It does not say "deployed", it says "developed". I've added a clarification.
"server farms with one or two network nodes that feed the rest of the farm over a LAN.” ≈ "pool", even though Satoshi did not use that word. What does it matter if those ASICs are placed in the same room or not, of course he understood that others could connect to this LAN via its WAN-connection via the so called Internet, using VPN, Tor or whatever...
@_date: 2015-10-07 15:43:06
Well, you can buy electricity and somebody's or a machine's time for money, and bitcoins can function as money...
@_date: 2015-10-07 15:38:21
OK, maybe I should add a couple of links to quotes from Krugman and others (got a reply from another cluless "economics professor" on Twitter too today... But if you find any "economics professors" that has published articles or papers in support of Bitcoin (saying it's "viable" or "useful" or similar) please add links here :)
@_date: 2015-10-06 21:07:24
It's more meant as a starting point for people who do not yet understand anything about Bitcoin (like these journalists) so they can  start to look at Bitcoin from a more realistic point of view. If you read the full article I do try to explain the real value of the Bitcoin network (in the end).
@_date: 2015-10-03 04:15:37
I'm sorta coming from the side of economics (the text is posted in the "Economics" category), so I'm saying it's not proven to function in the real world in the long run. Bitcoin is (if you agree 6+ years is enough).
@_date: 2015-10-08 10:46:41
Thanx, I've updated and clarified (early morning, not enough coffee).
@_date: 2015-10-07 20:03:46
Hahaha that IS funny!
@_date: 2015-10-13 02:37:42
Suing wouldn't make a bankchain more viable, less so actually, more messy. And Bitcoin does not "burn", it converts.
@_date: 2015-02-24 16:50:25
The visionary here is actually Satoshi Nakamoto:
@_date: 2016-07-12 13:20:50
Yeah, if you want to keep the word "organization" in the abbreviation DAO Bitcoin is the closest (read the text...).
