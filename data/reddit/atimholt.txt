I was going to post this as a private message, since it seemed less troll-y, but I’m putting a lot more detail into it than I was going to, so I thought it would be less fair to withhold this from the general conversation.
My version of the post comes from a place of frustration (from unrelated life-happenings, as well), and communicates my current understanding of the situation. I would have gone into more detail, but like I said over there, I wanted my anti-core rant to be limited to that one paragraph, since that’s not what I wanted the post to be about.
So why did I rant against Core in a post stating I wanted to know their side of things? Because that’s my current understanding, but I realize it’s *way* too black and white and pretty unlikely to be 100% accurate, just because of how extreme it is.
For example, the whole “they censor everything” narrative might not be as true as at first glance. My post, for example, was held off from appearing in the subreddit for a while, then allowed through. What appears to be total blanket censorship might just be manual vetting. I mean, I still disagree with that somewhat, but it’s far less serious.
But most of all, it’s pretty obvious literally demonizes the other side. does the same thing, but that just means *both* sides are strongly motivated to be… inaccurate—to see the worst in the other.
So I don’t like being in the mental state puts me in. Whether I still side with them or not, I thought it best to communicate my *current* state of mind without pretense. I just didn’t go into that here, because I thought it would be more rude.

I don’t really see a problem with talking about if they actually believe that is a pressing issue.
