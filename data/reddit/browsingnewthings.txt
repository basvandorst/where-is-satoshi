Great to read that you are taking a stance against Segwit2X. Let's stop the corporate takeover of the crypto ecosystem!

yes, they are also doing an ICO but I was writing somewhere else, it doesn't really matter to me as the exchange works as it is. It does what it is supposed to do, nothing mindblowing about it but nothing mindblowing about Shapeshift either. The ICO is more to get the funds to decentralize the exchange. I came across it and decided to put a little in. The fact that I was able to use their product rather than just reading an idea, a vision and a few lines of code was important to me. Also, they take a stance and haven't covered my Facebook and everything else I use with stupid popup adverts. They do what they are supposed to do to make the exchange work, are responsive and didn't look to raise hundreds of millions. All in all, chapeau to them

Great to see Flyp.me listed! 
Lots of people have been looking for an alternative to Shapeshift and here it comes Flyp.me. Once they add more coins, they will be really competitive. The exchange has launched a couple of months ago. 14 cryptocurrencies is a good start for an exchange that is still doing its ICO.

The trick starts when you get to Changelly and think there is no need for registration. I ended up using it and like the UI but was slightly annoyed to have fallen for it.

If you want to take a stance against Segwit2X, you should try Flyp.me. It's an exchange with no registration, email or account. 14 cryptos listed so far. Similar to Shapeshift but the team at Flyp.me is opposed to Segwit2X. I checked the NOB2X list.
Not sure why people see Changelly and Shapeshift as offering the same service. One is accountless, one is not. 
Anyhow, Flyp.me also shares 50% of the profits generated by the exchange and with Flyp.me Tokens anyone can also propose and vote. They call it distributed policy-making.
I have also seen on Twitter that Amir Taaki vouched for them. They have an API but I haven't had a look yet. If you do, let me know what you think

Similar to Shapeshift but with profit sharing, distributed policy making/governance and doesn't support Segwit2X. It's also more private if there is such a thing. Shapeshift basically tracks you around and gives your data voluntarily. Flypme says it doesn't do that. 
I like the UI of Changelly and they did well for themselves. The fees are sometimes outrighteous though and they trick users into believing it is accountless but it's not. You need to register with Changelly

I don't think so either. They are old school and have been around long enough to understand the importance of overall consensus. 
The team of HolyTransaction is behind Flyp.me. They have had their wallet since 2014 and now launched an accountless exchange. It makes sense to me. 
Also, using their exchange makes me feel much more relaxed about my funds. No lengthy wait and withdrawal fees.
