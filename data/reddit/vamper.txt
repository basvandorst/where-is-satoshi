Gone... It's estimated that a million bitcoins have been lost in one way shape or form and are not recoverable. I don't have any hard numbers, but in the early days plenty of wallets were lost and people have died with locked up Bitcoin... And I'm sure a few thousand exist on hard drives in landfills.

as much as i show my age with this... i have to agree, Gen-Y. I have much more in common with my parents, or even grandparents upbringing (0-25yo) than I do with my cousin 10 years younger than me. And that will likely only become a exponentially bigger gap with younger generations.

I have yet to sell a gun or gun parts with BTC but i have recently been adding it as a payment method.

@_date: 2014-05-14 11:04:05
dont forget to mention the disadvantage's. Im not trying to be a downer but we still sit on a few small bumps in the way. I for one would like to see an easier/safer wallet (smart wallet?) think Debit card... if i lose my card i dont lose my money. delay's in the transaction's :( this is my biggest pain. i feel the mining fee is actually quite large in the scale of things as well... but if you exclude it you lose your coins for a few days!
@_date: 2014-10-04 17:53:54
im not quite sure why the downvotes, my silver is doing the same as BTC, and thats a more stable investment. hell, half the market is doing exactly what btc is.

from what im seeing its not going to affect the "raw" processing power of a GPU... it is simply a control/instruction set for the hardware to follow and allows games to flow smoothly. I do plan on trying this shortly seems interesting!

yes... however the short term could be reflecting the long term with this issue... no doubt this ( all tho not the first time) can put a damper on the trust of bitcoin

this... ish, I have a very low mortgage but may be buying another home soon... i think if i could be free and clear on mortgage's on half my BTC (~1.1 BTC and climbing) i would be a fool not to. the other half could go towards more investments, or a nice retirement fund or sit on it a bit longer, either way i would be a winner.
@_date: 2014-06-03 10:50:48

not complete fool... i wanted to dip my feet in the world of mining... so i purchased 2 290x for 900 total (they threw in 2 500 gb hd's)
So far im looking at making ~ .02-.04 BTC and I expect decline over the next few months but im having fun and planning on hording the BTC for a few years+. When i feel my electric bill has climbed too high or im bored with this new hobby i will sell the cards off for a slight discount and make 80% of my investment back... minimum... by this time i expect to earn ~.5 BTC+- 
yes its a risk... but its a calculated risk... and a fun one! if everything falls on its ass tomorrow i can still make most of my investment back... dont let anyone else read this.

Many years ago at a local 2600 in the Chicago area i recall having a late night conversation with a group of guys speaking of something similar to bitcoin. This was ~2006-08, well before bitcoin was a "thing". unfortunately nearly everyone from the 2600 have gone separate ways and nobody recalls this conversation

i hear ya brother... sadly i wish i would have gotten in on it at the ground floor... i heard about it, I knew about it, and i even had a wallet downloaded in 2010 trying to figure out mining... unfortunately i had a shit internet connection and didn't mine anything. sometimes i want to kick my past self.
*on another note, we had a guy talk about a "currency based on digital algorithms" at my 2600 group in chicago around this time. Smart kid, and he was looking for a proper way of "protecting" his intellectual property's. this was between 2006-2008.

Im currently running 2x r290's and earning about .015 BTC a day... sometimes i earn a bit more sometimes a bit less... Altcoins are bouncing in and out and overall trending downward... Cost of my setup was about 1100 (had an old motherboard/cpu purchased a psu and the cards.) It took about 3 days for the cards to "break in" and i hash stable at 750 each (i could push this but my cooling solution is poor)
Overall if you already have the hardware i would run it... if you still need to source the hardware and will likely pay a premium i would avoid it. Im guessing i will have profitability for another 2 months before heat and altcoin prices make it worthless for me to burn electricity and monitor equipment... I will likely liquidate my hardware shortly after to recoup my investment cost. and be sitting on a ~1 BTC for my efforts.

Seems they are like that about almost everything... Talk about gold/silver and you are a dumb redneck. Talk about QE, or fed manipulation of the market and you are a conspiritard. Talk about how the market is unsustainable at its current rate and they will tell you its the best time to get in... Its almost as if they are a pyramid scheme just wanting to pump the market... Get the newbies, and watch it all fall.

Years ago I was at a 2600 meeting in chicago with a smart guy (kid) who built a great business building and installing (redacted) systems. Did really well for himself at the time.
After hours of the 2600 talking with the last few of us at the meet he starts talking about a digital money that would be used world wide, and remove government from it's grip. 
He wasnt wanting to put too much information out, and it was very late so details are fuzzy, however he was wanting to come up with a way to protect his intellectual property, and secretly.
Unfortunately our best ideas at the time where to send himself a certified letter and keep it sealed until a later date. 
Still the best possible satoshi theory I hodl.
@_date: 2017-11-30 05:03:34
I have tried to covertly contact a few people from these meetings and see if I could get a memory jog, but many of them have disbanded and gone off to the professional world and have no recollection of that night. By no means would I reveal such an identity without permission. But the timing is right, and the possibility of satoshi being an American with "weeb" tendencies fits a 20 something tech professional more than many other answers.

the first time your account is compromised you will be thankful... as well you will be thankful for the other protections your bank offers to get you the stolen money back, unfortunately BTC does not have that.
@_date: 2017-11-28 04:23:51

i'm not saying you are right or wrong, however, looking for "confirmation bias" can get you stuck in deep doo doo. I have moneys in BTC, and PMs and after the next big crash i plan on going long in the market, and possibly snatching up some investment properties.
However, if i looked at the right sites (subreddits) i could find people saying the stock market is still strong and will make me rich, even in the inflated state that it sits... i will find other people telling me that silver/gold is a deal, or a waste of money all in the same sentence.
