100% agree. Im out of crypto until Tether is gone. Everyone holding the bag when this folds will be burnt.

so you are not concerned that they printed $200M today and traded it for crypto? im a fellow aussie who sold out at recent highs because the more i researched this the worse i felt

200million today actually. Growing exponentially keeping the market afloat

i would leave maybe $5k tops on an exchange. its a personal number. coinbase is definitely one of the safer options but its not guaranteed and has risk. shit load more risk than a bank. a bank has insurance for theft. an exchange doesnt and they also arent regulated
