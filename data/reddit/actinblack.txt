I just came with an realization, than bitcoin could become peoples global IPO, think about it, is decentralized, driven by ordinary people, increasing value on people beliefs and values. After all this thinking I can Imagine the magnitude of bitcoin's impact on our future!

A rating system like in the decentralized free markets would pretty much solve that problem. If you are a women, just choose drivers with excellent rating and a long history of successful drives.

It makes sens to me, wouldn't you prefer a decentralized marketplace where both your average Uber driver and the traditional cabs can compete? Isn't stuff like this what bitcoin is all about? Decentralization of very useful tools like these, that bring the power back to the people.
Unbannable by the government, this could intercept markets like Germany and France where Uber is banned.
What I have read is that they plan to fuse multiple ledgers in to the system, Bitcoin as well. So I wouldn't be butthurt about that they push their own coin.
