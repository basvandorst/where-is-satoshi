I'm seeing this as it being them who are insured not their customers which means it's a good thing but not in terms of their customers who really could do with some kind of insurance for times when they fall to any bad losses. Hopefully in time something will be implemented.

I don't think you really understand how Bitcoin works, you can't "hack" all the accounts.  You can take over the network with a 51% attack (see wiki for details) but that's not something that would have to be permanent.

Possibly it won't happen. Take case of Africa, people can afford a bank account since ages but no internet access
For faster developing nations, its possible

Civilizations last about 200 years. The age of western dominance is coming to an end. It will be China's turn to dominate next. Can't be stopped. Welcome your new betters.

1 - It is a glitch. 
2 - It is some reverse mr 102 that acted in some undergrund exchange, then making prices go up for a while
3 - It is plain bullshit made by someone who had nothing to do.

I have nothing to hide frankly, but my financial details are my business. I choose to take measures to defend my privacy. If someone really wanted to find out if I am a bitcoin holder they could but I certainly don't advertise it. The problem I have with the NSA and all of that is that we were never given a choice and there was never a requirement to prove probable cause before they stole our personal information.

Not enough power for them alone to create a 51% attack.  They would need to partner with other farms to do so

True. Reddit and Bitcointalk are two shelters for crypto guys
