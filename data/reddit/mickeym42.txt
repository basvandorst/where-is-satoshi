Looks like we are moving to the resolution point of a bull pennant on the daily. Everything in the last week has just been within that pattern.
@_date: 2019-07-16 17:05:48
Back to 21 day EMA/gap fill/some other meme. It'll be back up by September.
@_date: 2019-07-14 16:57:03
It's a big ol' bear trap.
@_date: 2019-07-15 16:46:19
I sold 1/10th of my stack today to fund a house purchase next month. It hurts to sell it but I think we may be sub £10k for a couple of months so hedging my bets.
@_date: 2019-07-01 19:59:41
Another attempt to get below $10k bought up.
@_date: 2019-07-01 12:32:32
Finally some movement!
@_date: 2019-07-16 18:54:35
Do we need to remind everyone that there were like 8 of these big corrections during the last bull market? This is normal!
@_date: 2019-07-04 18:17:06
I think it's nearly pump o'clock ��
@_date: 2019-07-07 19:08:39
Up I think.
@_date: 2019-07-16 17:04:08
Look out below!
@_date: 2019-07-02 19:48:44
Yesterday's 500 point rally was a dead cat bounce. So far we're sustaining this one. Will be interesting to see what Asia does tonight.
@_date: 2019-07-01 15:59:55
Anything that falls fast bounces. Even a dead cat. Next few hours will show if the bounce is sustained.
@_date: 2019-07-02 06:43:12
@_date: 2019-07-01 12:48:09
To continue the rally we need to resolve the correction.
@_date: 2019-07-19 18:09:13
I feel like we may get a Bart back down in the coming hours.
@_date: 2019-07-02 16:17:13
Somewhere between $30-$40k in this calendar year.
@_date: 2019-07-02 16:18:27
Some consolidation here and a nice bull flag would be good.
@_date: 2019-07-01 15:51:09
That may have been the bottom of the dip. No one knows.
@_date: 2019-07-07 18:17:41
I don't trade, just HODL but I expect a big move this evening as it's trading in an increasingly narrow range.
@_date: 2019-07-23 22:05:30
Traders selling their leveraged gains.
@_date: 2019-07-28 22:39:10
$8500, the gap fill is self fulfilling prophecy.
@_date: 2019-07-03 06:02:12
What does price usually do on July 4th?
@_date: 2019-07-01 15:04:56
HODL. We are in a bull market. This is a pullback.
@_date: 2019-07-02 15:02:25
Just popped back over $10,500.
@_date: 2019-07-14 12:24:52
Well be back above $11,500 by close tonight.
@_date: 2019-07-01 15:50:17
Could be a dead cat bounce too early to say.
@_date: 2019-07-01 19:27:23
Here we go again...
@_date: 2019-07-07 17:50:38
@_date: 2019-07-02 15:41:37
It certainly seems that way.
@_date: 2019-11-22 12:40:00
Beware of being shaken out here. Easier said than done if you've been DCAing but if you're here for the bull run it makes no sense to sell here.
@_date: 2019-08-28 15:36:16
Feels like it's ready to explode to me.
@_date: 2019-08-28 18:21:19
This didn't age well ��
@_date: 2019-06-19 18:33:29
I don't understand people are talking in terms of price alone when discussing when to sell. Would I sell some at $40K? Is it November 2019 or 2020? 2019 not so much. 2020? Maybe.
@_date: 2019-06-17 15:03:38
Smack down at $9400.
@_date: 2019-06-16 11:13:24
It would be nice to hang out here for a while and form some support.
@_date: 2019-06-09 18:11:09
I wouldn't buy Bitcoin through Revolut, their fee is approximately 3% if you include the spread. I don't know about Coinbase but I transfer euros via Revolut to Bitstamp.
@_date: 2019-06-02 11:30:08
@_date: 2019-06-13 21:24:50
$8300 reclaimed.
@_date: 2019-06-02 15:36:28
I think we'll make another run at $9k today.
@_date: 2019-06-02 12:04:05
And we're off again!
@_date: 2019-06-02 07:42:12
Don't anyone jinx it with the Vegeta memes this time.
@_date: 2019-06-01 10:28:51
I sold the last of my gold at the end of April and put it in to Bitcoin. If you can afford to not touch the money for a couple of years I think that at the beginning of a bull run in BTC it's the most profitable place for it.
@_date: 2019-06-25 17:10:26
More like 11.6k for resistance.
@_date: 2019-06-23 06:16:51
I am a girl and love to talk crypto and politics.
@_date: 2019-06-04 00:17:29
Support at $7800?
@_date: 2019-06-22 05:52:08
Well that was nice to wake up to!
@_date: 2019-06-19 18:44:45
Looks poised to make a move on the hourly.
@_date: 2019-06-02 18:42:24
I think we'll have another pump in the next hour or two.
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:14:33
Blow off top?
@_date: 2019-06-24 16:21:01
No, I'm a bit further north than that. Right country though.
@_date: 2019-06-02 07:19:07
Bull flag on the hourly, there should be a break in the next 1-2 hours.
@_date: 2019-10-07 13:06:12
Bitcoin finally starting to show some signs of life again.
@_date: 2019-06-02 07:36:21
And we're off!
@_date: 2019-06-21 03:10:08
Nope I'm a girl (despite username)
@_date: 2019-06-07 18:51:42
Midnight UTC
@_date: 2019-06-30 12:39:19
Close above $12,500 today.
@_date: 2019-06-29 17:55:40
Bitcoin looks poised to make a big move on the hourly.
@_date: 2019-06-20 20:22:51
@_date: 2019-06-06 18:09:53
I'd like for us to just dump to $7k and get it done.
@_date: 2019-06-20 19:35:35
But why sell now?
@_date: 2019-06-19 16:20:45
Check if it's being sold by one of the verified sellers on the Trezor website.
@_date: 2019-06-25 06:29:47
£12k today? ��
@_date: 2019-06-02 07:56:12
I think $9k may be a tough nut to crack. But who knows?!
@_date: 2019-06-28 19:29:25
I won't be buying a lambo. I bought half my stack end of 2018 and the rest early May this year. I'll be selling half when it's enough to pay off my mortgage, the remainder will be my (early) retirement fund.
@_date: 2019-06-23 21:42:04
@_date: 2019-06-24 16:06:36
Then Trump starts talking about sanctions against Iran ��
@_date: 2019-06-15 16:56:18
@_date: 2019-06-07 06:20:41
Nice pump! Can we breach $8k again?
@_date: 2019-06-03 18:00:00
Pump or dump in the next hour? I'm not sure today.
@_date: 2019-06-09 20:22:50
I'm not in the knife catching business. I've done all my buying and won't be selling anything any time soon.
@_date: 2019-06-05 20:33:08
Who the fuck down voted this? I AM a girl!
@_date: 2019-06-19 17:25:41
I bought mine from a Trezor approved Amazon seller with no problems. The original packaging and seal was intact and you download the firmware directly from the Trezor website. It depends how paranoid you are ��
@_date: 2019-06-11 20:05:10
Another assault on $8k happening.
@_date: 2019-06-23 17:09:36
This, but don't be tempted not to update as your device may be left vulnerable.
@_date: 2019-06-20 18:33:20
BTC looks primed to pump.
@_date: 2019-06-28 09:28:02
Back above $13k by end of day.
@_date: 2019-06-07 16:57:20
You too ☺
@_date: 2019-06-07 16:51:21
If we can close above $8200 it would be very bullish indeed.
The drop 3 weeks ago was caused by the whale dumping 5k BTC. This one was precipitated by someone dropping 25k BTC. The overall trend is still up.
@_date: 2019-06-05 20:24:27
Despite my name I'm a girl. I've wanted to ask this question.
@_date: 2019-06-04 17:50:39
@_date: 2019-06-28 19:19:38
Looking good Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-06-06 06:31:53
We're in a narrowing range on the hourly, expect a decisive breakout below $7600 or above $7800 in the next 3 hours.
@_date: 2019-06-04 17:47:54
If we don't bounce on this one then we may be going to $6400.
@_date: 2019-06-25 06:33:01
Only my partner and business partner know I own BTC. When my business partner asks me to help him get in to crypto I'll know FOMO has started.
@_date: 2019-06-26 18:41:49
ATH by next week?!
@_date: 2019-06-22 07:46:51
Mycelium is a nice wallet.
@_date: 2019-06-29 12:03:31
And back to $12k.
@_date: 2019-06-19 05:43:35
@_date: 2019-06-29 11:13:13
It's the weekly, monthly and quarterly close tomorrow. It's interesting to see some of the analysis from people on Twitter/Youtube. Some are all about the charts without any consideration of the context. Others claim to be rational and keeping emotion out of their analysis but are clearly way too attached to their models.
@_date: 2019-06-12 15:11:10
Pump alert!
@_date: 2019-06-04 00:17:44
@_date: 2019-06-24 15:58:16
Nice and calm price movements today.
@_date: 2019-06-05 20:22:16
Eh up.
@_date: 2019-06-21 11:36:21
I think we blast through today.
@_date: 2019-06-24 16:40:44
Yes, signing exec order for more.
@_date: 2019-06-09 18:12:50
I think we need to drop to 7k to get a bounce. Seems sentiment turns on a pin on crypto Twitter.
@_date: 2019-06-07 21:55:52
Binance is down, speculation it has been hacked.
@_date: 2019-06-20 19:17:38
If we can just cross $9500...
@_date: 2019-06-08 12:19:58
Round number.
@_date: 2019-06-07 16:29:57
@_date: 2019-06-25 23:16:55
So what if there is. This is a bull market. The correction will be recovered within a week. HODL.
@_date: 2019-06-26 05:11:42
Holy shit!
@_date: 2019-06-25 17:08:53
Waiting for £10k BTC
@_date: 2019-06-17 14:29:04
The wallet file in the Multibit wallet was saved as .wallet
@_date: 2019-06-03 10:12:25
I suspect this week week be rough for stock markets which could bode well for Crypto.
@_date: 2019-06-04 15:02:33
The fundamentals haven't changed. Someone sold (and rebought) 25k BTC. I don't see any reason for major further correction from here. Some consolidation in this area would be good, healthy even.
@_date: 2019-06-12 15:11:53
@_date: 2019-06-09 11:19:00
We may get am early indication of direction when CME futures open tonight.
@_date: 2019-06-30 14:00:50
Definitely looking unlikely now! I was suspicious this was a shakeout to build the shorts then burn them.
@_date: 2019-06-01 10:30:26
I don't think it's safe to assume we will definitely see 40% corrections. The corrections have become shallower in each bull market. 20% may be your max this time.
@_date: 2019-06-27 07:46:07
Support forming at $12,250. Below that has just been wicks on the hourly. HODL.
@_date: 2019-06-06 15:59:28
@_date: 2019-06-26 20:56:11
Jeez I went for a bath and bitcoin tanked �� still I'm up over 200% so can't complain.
@_date: 2019-12-04 19:50:54
It's quiet in here. Anyone else doing the Bybit brawl? I'm still learning trading so not risking high leverage or position size but it's an eye opener that in the teams I'm in I'm in the upper third and top 5 traders by P&amp;L. There are an awful lot of people getting rekt.
@_date: 2019-06-17 19:34:56
Looks like another attempt at $9400.
@_date: 2019-12-29 14:43:40
There are some encouraging signs. Hash ribbon giving a buy signal on the daily. Putting in some higher lows and highs on lower time frames. We may have bottomed.
@_date: 2019-06-26 05:26:31
Woop! £10k ☺ was not expecting that quite so soon!
@_date: 2019-06-03 12:16:40
This is a nice little move above $8500.
@_date: 2019-09-24 18:55:07
Gap fill!
@_date: 2019-09-25 17:11:48
Litecoin has just headed up a couple of bucks. Since it led the BTC plunge yesterday it may be worth a BTC long with a tight stop loss.
@_date: 2019-09-24 18:53:15
I'm just glad it's moving again, even if it is down!
@_date: 2019-09-02 14:49:58
I only tick 4 of those
@_date: 2019-09-28 23:55:52
Tomorrow evening between the CME futures opening and the weekly close will likely be volatile. Then there's the monthly and quarter close Monday.
@_date: 2019-09-01 21:36:00
Shorts getting rekt tonight.
@_date: 2019-09-24 18:48:54
Ooft. I think we're heading sub 9k.
@_date: 2019-05-30 21:16:40
@_date: 2019-05-16 18:36:21
I swear I just saw a red candle plummet down?!
@_date: 2019-05-06 20:38:16
For actual Crypto purchase you pay equivalent to 3% fees (1.5% actual fee plus a wide spread equal to another 1.5%). So wouldn't buy there again. But handy for exchanging then transferring euros to Bitstamp.
I love Revolut for spending abroad too.
@_date: 2019-05-13 15:21:28
@_date: 2019-05-31 13:07:32
@_date: 2019-05-13 16:37:46
This could be a combination of institutional money flowing in combined with beginning of a bull market and BTC being used as a safe haven. I strongly believe there will be a stock market crash this year. If so this bull run will be on steroids.
@_date: 2019-05-25 16:38:34
Extremely narrow trading range today.
@_date: 2019-05-26 19:27:46
Building momentum...
@_date: 2019-05-15 19:15:19
Oops! Come on the bulls!
@_date: 2019-05-08 17:04:31
It's positive that there hasn't been any impact on BTC price through all of this.
@_date: 2019-05-31 12:16:55
So if the stock market is rough as futures indicate then Bitcoin may be seen as a safe haven. On the other hand you can't discount manipulation before the BTC futures contracts close.
@_date: 2019-05-12 10:06:13
What happens tomorrow when everyone's wire transfers land on exchanges? I think the pump will continue to midweek then blow off top.
@_date: 2019-05-25 08:09:18
I predict break of $8400 by Monday.
@_date: 2019-05-18 08:06:12
Why can I only see one post in this thread when it shows there are 9?
@_date: 2019-05-08 17:35:15
Binance hack and CEO comments.
@_date: 2019-05-26 19:09:10
There's a nice little push north happening now.
@_date: 2019-05-20 20:50:11
@_date: 2019-05-22 20:12:49
It's eerily quiet after all the volatility.
@_date: 2019-05-15 19:21:22
I hope you're right about $8400 today.
@_date: 2019-05-27 15:05:15
I use Bitstamp and Revolut. Transfer money from UK bank account to Revolut, exchange to Euros and send by SEPA to Bitstamp. Can all be same day if before 11am. And of course withdraw BTC to a hard wallet from the exchange to HODL.
@_date: 2019-05-24 21:21:31
I don't see any reason to delete them.
@_date: 2019-05-17 04:17:23
It's recovering pretty well. This is bullish. I bought the dip.
@_date: 2019-05-23 21:41:35
We may revisit $8k again today?
@_date: 2019-05-13 10:17:44
So what will be the impact of Binance reopening to deposits and withdrawals tomorrow?
$6800 needs to hold otherwise we could retrace below $6k tomorrow. Expecting volatility after today.
@_date: 2019-05-31 20:51:19
@_date: 2019-05-10 16:54:21
Glad things have been stable today. Staying here for a while would be fine by me.
@_date: 2019-05-31 09:45:01
$8400 will be an interesting test in the next hour or two if we get there.
@_date: 2019-05-17 03:05:20
What goes up etc...
@_date: 2019-05-21 04:36:35
Just download multibit classic and open the wallet. I did this myself recently with an old wallet from 2013.
@_date: 2019-05-30 18:40:31
I would download to a hot wallet whilst you wait for your hard wallet to arrive. Depends how much you're talking about though.
@_date: 2019-05-13 15:05:23
I FOMOd in some more today �� I hold all the BTC I can afford to lose now and plan to HODL.
@_date: 2019-05-28 15:07:15
The drops tend to be just a wick.
@_date: 2019-05-26 19:53:27
$10k by end of the week.
@_date: 2019-05-11 20:53:28
Fear of missing out.
@_date: 2019-05-23 15:19:57
Back above $7800
@_date: 2019-05-14 05:50:22
The difference is that the end of 2017 was the end of the bull market. This is the start.
@_date: 2019-05-19 01:32:13
Going up again.
@_date: 2019-05-29 21:17:44
A Trezor hard wallet. And Mycelium on my phone for small amounts.
@_date: 2019-05-13 17:14:10
According to some BTC is still undervalued at present even though technically it will be screaming overbought on the indicators. Maybe this is just the leveller.
@_date: 2019-05-26 19:00:20
It's quiet even for the weekend. Everyone is holding their breath waiting to see which way it breaks out of the end of the wedge. Maybe China will decide it tonight?
@_date: 2019-05-30 13:30:54
It's coming to a decision point on a narrowing trading range.
@_date: 2019-05-08 19:36:48
I'm not sure why you can't, I transfer from UK bank to a Revolut, exchange to Euros, transfer to Bitstamp and buy Bitcoin. Are you saying Kraken don't accept from Revolut?
@_date: 2019-05-12 19:20:47
Binance allowing withdrawals again from Tuesday...
@_date: 2019-05-13 18:58:14
It was in a custodial account so pretty easy to sell.
@_date: 2019-05-18 10:45:10
I think 5K unlikely but we may test 6.4 again.
@_date: 2019-05-16 11:36:31
If you're based in the UK I'd recommend Bitstamp as an exchange, they don't accept GBP deposits so open an account with Revolut, transfer money from your bank account to Revolut and exchange to Euros (zero fees up to £5k exchange per month) then make SEPA transfer to Bitstamp. Get yourself a Trezor. Job done.
Don't buy all your investment at once. Ease into the bull run so you don't end up suddenly under water if there's a retracement. And don't leave your BTC on the exchange.
@_date: 2019-05-19 10:20:14
Nearly 8.1k now ��
@_date: 2019-05-29 15:42:06
....and it just dipped below 25k
@_date: 2019-05-10 06:04:27
Feels good to be no longer be under water.
@_date: 2019-05-31 13:25:24
@_date: 2019-05-31 12:09:26
Between 2 and 4pm GMT will be important timeframe. US markets open and CME futures contracts close.
@_date: 2019-05-18 10:28:54
Head and shoulders forming?
@_date: 2019-05-18 07:16:11
Head and shoulders forming? ��
@_date: 2019-05-20 09:27:40
Are we up for another Bart today?
@_date: 2019-05-13 15:15:58
I'm sat open mouthed at Tradeview.
@_date: 2019-05-20 18:39:05
It has been delayed.
@_date: 2019-05-29 06:04:37
Bart! $8400 being defended currently.
@_date: 2019-05-27 15:48:03
It's holding out on us today..
@_date: 2019-05-30 20:32:57
Will this have the energy to take us back up?
@_date: 2019-05-26 19:57:18
I called $8400 by tomorrow.
@_date: 2019-05-31 16:39:57
Short squeeze?
@_date: 2019-05-12 15:38:29
Back below $7k
@_date: 2019-05-30 18:41:34
I don't think so today. I think we'll consolidate again here, maybe try again tomorrow.
@_date: 2019-05-20 11:20:41
It just looks like the pattern is forming. Hard to know which way it will go.
@_date: 2019-05-13 15:13:03
