You need to check your history, and I don't mean your American history. There have been many empires/super powers over the ages, they all failed sooner or later.

In that case then yes, I suppose it would be worth a little effort trying, I forget people are stupid.

I have two copies in separate physical locations, this solves the fire/flood/natural disaster problem.
They are then both split in to two halves and discreetly hidden in stupidly obscure places no-one would think of checking.
It makes them a pain to get to if I need them, but that's kind of the point. If they are hard for me to recover when I know where they are, someone with no idea should never find them, even by accident.
I hope...

So Craig is *proving* he's a fraud in court. The gall and hubris is staggering.

Way more than twice as many, the vast majority of all drugs will be bought with FIAT currency of some kind.

Great interview, starting to fomo again, damnit.

Fully insured I doubt you'll find anywhere. At least at this point in time. 
You could just do it yourself with a few bank safety deposit boxes in separate locations. Half the seed in one, half in another.
Then duplicate that in two more locations for redundancy.

No it doesn't, that's true enough. 
However, for the entirety of human existence we have used multiple forms of currency. We are a varied species with different cultures and values, and I don't see that changing any time soon. 
Not everyone will embrace BTC.

I've always thought this was a strange view. 
Is there only room for one asset? one currency? one precious metal?
Everything ever created has competition, that isn't a bad thing.

Yeah it worked wonderfully for Isildur after all.

Say it ain't so!

Because it's a complicated subject and even to people with a technical background it can take some serious time and effort to actually get a rudimentary understanding of how everything works.
I mean you have confirmations, hashrates, inputs, mining, nodes, private keys, public keys, signatures, wallets etc
It's not exactly easy reading and understandable for the masses is it?

Wow, finally broke the rollercoaster and heading for orbit!
@_date: 2019-05-30 12:19:57
Interestingly none of those words describe Craig.
@_date: 2019-05-26 19:10:47
Yeah and I'm the fairy godmother.

Sorry to say there isn't anything you can do to stop the transaction going through. What you should be doing is chalking it up to experience, and then figuring out how you were hacked and fixing that.

We no longer accept paypal at work due to their fuckery, the need to keep x% in there at all times (for charge backs), locked funds, no explanation, no support.
See ya.

Oh this is going to be interesting, and funny.
Lambs slaughtered, blood everywhere.

256-bits of entropy? Assuming 24 seed words.
Good luck with that.

Wow the local drug dealers sure are getting younger.
