RBF = Replace By Fee
Can be used on some wallets like Electrum. When a transaction has a small fee you can replace it with a transaction with a higher fee. Miners will take the transaction with the higher fee, replacing the one with the small fee.

Ok to import into Electrum put "p2wpkh-p2sh:" infront of the private key so it looks like this: "p2wpkh-p2sh:YourPrivateKeyHere" (without quotes) and it should work.

Please provide more information...
1 - Did you send it to a wallet on your computer or online wallet?
2 - What type of codes are you talking about?
3 - Where did you send the bitcoins from?

 First try this:
The list for the 24 words is like this:
1...... 13......
2...... 14......
3...... 15......
.... with 2 rows.
See if you did not write the words in the wrong order in the 2 rows from left to right and under so like this:
1....... 2........
3....... 4........

Happened to somebody i know once.

Nothing you can do but wait..... Coinbase does not have a RBF or CPFP option as far as i know.

1 - Do your receiving addresses start with 1, 3 or bc1?
2 - Are your 12 words ALL in this list:  [  ?
Answer me those 2 questions and i will help you recover your bitcoins.

Jeezus... a -5 just for asking a question... and if you don't ask and post you are scammed you are called dumb... it's never good for you people.

Honestly.... i hate Wasabi
@_date: 2019-06-27 20:04:14
Uhm lol no, everybody who has a bip39 mnemonic seed has words from that list and brute forcing a 12 word seed is close to impossible
@_date: 2019-06-27 12:34:14
What wallet did you use? Are you the sender or receiver?
@_date: 2019-06-16 08:20:05
Electrum is one of the best, it's light (no need to download the whole blockchain) and it's used by many people.
For info: Electrum.org

If i remember correctly there is a cancel button on the right as long as the withdraw didn't process?

" There actually is an expiration in the mempool, which evicts unconfirmed transactions after N hours, where N is set by -mempoolexpiry, and defaults to 72 hours.
This is not a reliable feature, as wallets (and really, anyone) can rebroadcast the transaction, but helps keeping the mempool fresh."

Down for some people like me, i think it is a major datacenter problem since other major sites are also down for me
@_date: 2019-06-24 11:33:28
Down for me to
@_date: 2019-06-24 11:58:14
Weird... i can't access 30% of sites i visit....
@_date: 2019-06-17 21:04:45
Nobody can really answer this question when it will be dropped but maybe you can try to do a RBF?
What wallet did you use to send the transaction?
@_date: 2019-06-27 09:45:09
I already told you:
Open Electrum - Click on Wallet - Seed
@_date: 2019-06-19 21:45:40
Does the address start with a 1, 3 or bc1? I'll show you how to import it to Electrum.

Ok, just came to mind.
If all words are in the bip39 list you made 1 of these mistakes:
1. You wrote down a word that looks like another word in the list, you can see a list of look alike words here:  [ 
2. You have the order of 2 or more words wrong, can't help with this one but a good read to recover your coins is this:  [ 
Hope this helps.
