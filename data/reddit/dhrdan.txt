1. The internet was not created with the intention of sharing information worldwide. If you know your history, you know this isn't true.
2. Banks don't make their money from fees, they make their money from loans and leverage. (investment banks) The way they leverage 30:1.... that's how they make their money. fees are just a smaller portion.
3. This guy i know told me that the world was flat, i believe him because the naysayers have their own interests in mind.
You sound like you're 15, and if you're not... open your eyes, you're dreaming. You want an INTERNATIONAL currency that governments can't influence, and that big banks can't profit from... invest in your dreams.

It's dumb because bitcoin is supposed to be "easy." If i have to do all this, just to hold a few thousand dollars, a FDIC bank is better.

The hell are you talking about, EVERY FUCKING PERSON who invests in bitcoin says the following "well, it's convenient and doesn't have any transaction fees. It's the easiest and best way to pay..."
Nobody said bitcoin was easy???? so much fail.

A business does transactions on a 30 day basis when you talk about credit card transactions. If  you want to reach 3 yrs ago.. you're insane. 3yrs from now water might triple in price, i'm not making my desicions based on speculation, he claims that bitcoin is more "reliable," i'm just calling out that this is untrue.

As an accountant, your inability to fight chargebacks is your problem. If you had any real type of contract that users had to agree to, you wouldn't have that problem.
So instead of doing actual work (fighting chargebacks) you'd rather trade in a currency that in 1 day lost ...what over $200 usd in value??? ya... that sounds so much more reliable.

Welcome to the circlejerk.
In all seriousness, i really looked into bitcoin as a currency, knowing that in 5yrs, mobile phones will make fast payment a necessity. That said, anyone who thinks bitcoin has any long term stability is high. 
RIP bitcoin... great experiment.

If you were my uncle, i'd tell you that i'd rather have cash. You can dream all you want, just don't waste my time.
