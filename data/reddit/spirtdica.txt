I can rest easy that the USB will not be compromised.  I'd have a separate hot wallet, to reduce the need for retrieval to minimum frequency.  So multiple USBs is no concern for me.
What if I configured the external device/persistent volume to the point that Armory was ready to begin working on TAILS, but with no wallet data whatsoever?  Memorization of the seed phrase would allow the wallet to be retrieved with relative ease, but even if someone got to the files on the device, there would be nothing to betray the public key.  It would, however, betray your knowledge of Armory.
In this case, would a TAILS persistent volume (recorded right after successful Armory installation) be preferable in terms of ease of use.  Using the TAILS tools package it would be easier to ensure that no trace of the public key remains after use.  This would make it preferable but by no means necessary to store all the files on one device, in the persistent volume of TAILS.  Am I correct?
Assume that by happenstance I have a 512GB SD so the size of the combined files gives me no pause.
PS-Thanks for the help everyone

That's a great idea-I never thought of using an external media device to hold the blockchain and related media.  
Would there be any advantage to integrating the blockchain data onto a persistent volume?  The only one I can imagine offhand is if your computer had a limited number of drives.
From a privacy standpoint, I understand that live TAILS is always better.  I am beginning to think that my best bet is to forego the persistent volume in favor of a separate USB.

I intend to do exactly that!  Electrum is my general go-to.  Combined with a TREZOR, that's my hot wallet.  I want Armory for an ultra-cold wallet, which brought me to the question of TAILS.

Were there ever really excuses other than mining cartels
