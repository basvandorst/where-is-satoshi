On the bright side, at least we arent hearing too much from those trolls lately calling for down down down and 6k or crash, among things in their vocabulary.
@_date: 2018-03-16 04:27:16
You know, the seems so right. Bolton is a hawk and there is also good reason to secure that southern wall, its not just the illegals its a means to slip in the country terrorists and moles.
@_date: 2018-03-01 18:17:19
We will be assimilated...
@_date: 2018-03-12 22:22:37
Don't forget hellfire and brimstone preachers claiming they know the future.
@_date: 2018-03-16 01:51:28
This is just messed up that same time every day these dips keep happening predictably and screws up everything. There isn't even recovery enough before another dip in the day.
@_date: 2018-03-09 03:08:43
We have dishonored our clan, how do we regain honor? 
@_date: 2018-03-15 15:10:26
Articles said he wont be doing that till september
@_date: 2018-03-30 18:19:18
Every year? Its been crashing every month.
@_date: 2018-03-15 02:51:04
As long as there is relief in sight for this dip.
@_date: 2018-03-16 00:55:32
Its just plain stupid, 2x a day same hours and its like clock work. 
@_date: 2018-03-09 02:22:52
Oh God help us!!
@_date: 2018-03-15 02:26:13
I hope for the best, even though the slight recovery earlier seemed more like a dead cat mini bounce.
@_date: 2018-03-16 05:04:00
War is good for an economy. Will it be good for Bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-03-09 12:32:17
I am without words and awe-struck of your wisdom. 
@_date: 2018-03-16 00:42:59
I am sure all of us are pretty much sick and tired of all these major dips but maybe we just need to accept its part of investing in cryptos. 
@_date: 2018-03-09 12:28:12
Thank goodness everything is alright.
@_date: 2018-03-16 04:25:45
We got nothing to lose if our money is in cryptos.
@_date: 2018-03-16 03:44:44
On the bright side, ends our misery of having to deal with bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-03-09 04:32:54
Now where is that uber-accurate TA person when you need him? And I do not mean the one who keeps posting FUD here.
@_date: 2018-03-02 17:46:50
Pump and dump or manipulation.
@_date: 2018-03-07 06:39:58
Well who wouldn't lose interest with all the volatility and frustrations BTC creates. It drops dead at mid 11k every week and slowly bleeds back to anywhere between 9-10 and stays that way for days on end. Its just silly. 
@_date: 2018-03-09 03:36:07
Oh my gosh, he is right. Lets all panic sell now for the end is near. Hurry, don't delay!! 
@_date: 2018-03-01 00:49:55
Repent for the end is near, repent thy sins before thy god
@_date: 2018-03-17 20:44:25
I prefer Mona coin ��

Dragged down to Hell
@_date: 2018-03-03 16:59:22
The guy probably got a castration already.
@_date: 2018-03-15 15:41:45
Looks like a fart than a full dump... for now. Now back to the moon!
@_date: 2018-03-16 00:21:26
Maybe the dip is skipped for today and it will go back up only to crash tomorrow.
@_date: 2018-03-11 15:20:44
We should learn to expect the bouncing especially with that Mt. Gox trustee dumping BTC in the exchanges. 
@_date: 2018-03-11 18:51:22
I'm just happy its a good trade for a Sunday. If it dips tomorrow, then its discount shopping time for a profit.
@_date: 2018-02-07 17:16:23
Just what we need. Positive news. Can't wait for those green candles going up and up!
@_date: 2018-03-14 22:03:32
O Almighty Bitcoin please ascend to the Heavens in the fullness of your glory that you may shower us once more of your blessings and save us from the blight of fear, uncertainty and doubt. 
@_date: 2018-03-16 01:59:41
That isnt even a guarantee. If day traders or their bots are [as allegedly] doing this at the specific times of the day then its silly to even think if we reach a certain price range this will stop since the bots and day traders doing all these dumps will always be there.
@_date: 2018-03-04 20:02:11
... somethings brewing this way comes...
@_date: 2018-03-06 00:31:09
Coz BTC just loves testing our nerves.
@_date: 2018-03-10 17:43:25
Its the rise of the Bots
@_date: 2018-02-08 16:54:13
The ACH takes forever but at the moment seems like the only way I can transact with Coinbase. Got whacked an international fee for using a debit card.
@_date: 2018-02-08 22:35:37
Its high time we blame SkyNet for all these "crashes" in the cryptocurrency world.
@_date: 2018-02-06 12:33:49
You can always be "young at heart".
@_date: 2018-03-11 16:00:01
Just expect the dips at the usual hours every day.
@_date: 2018-02-12 12:23:28
Make Bitcoin Great Again!
@_date: 2018-02-21 18:24:38
The power of BITCOIN compels you!!
@_date: 2018-02-06 20:40:15
Just buy in and if it dips, sell like there's no tomorrow. 
@_date: 2018-03-17 12:39:11
We have been assimilated. Resistance is futile.
@_date: 2018-02-14 13:17:33
Yes, coz the bitcoin cow will soon jump over it.
@_date: 2018-03-30 14:09:09
It just gets worse every day. When will it all end?
@_date: 2018-03-10 23:12:44
I love the posts here, even when things are down you find the slightest humor in things such as doom and gloom or end of the world comments. Don't mind me if I add fodder to the fire.
@_date: 2018-02-07 16:52:34
Almost all. ��
@_date: 2018-03-15 15:05:30
Its that time again.
@_date: 2018-03-10 16:29:36
What is the chance the Sunday dump will bring things down?
@_date: 2018-03-08 00:25:00
how long shall that take?
@_date: 2018-02-25 20:30:35
Love seeing those long green candles go up.
@_date: 2018-03-12 20:54:54
Is the coast clear yet or are there more red dildos to come?
@_date: 2018-03-11 17:02:16
The best strategy for that is buys those dips for profit.
@_date: 2018-03-11 16:03:42
Glad to hear.
@_date: 2018-03-09 06:10:01
By this time most of us should be happy it hits really low so we can go back up. Hopefully...
@_date: 2018-02-26 18:55:43
... and the 150-160 guys asking for a big dip.
@_date: 2018-02-26 18:18:24
Ferment the Kimchi and Hold the MSG.
@_date: 2018-02-08 20:42:35
Was that you asking for a follow and he said No sir? lol...
@_date: 2018-02-28 15:16:33
Dayumn, whenever Bitcoin dips its like watching a referee get up after getting knocked down in a wrestling match, takes its time.
@_date: 2018-02-23 22:21:00
Hopefully it stays above 10k
@_date: 2018-02-22 02:40:07
For the fearful shall be banished into the abyss of eternal darkness, never to see the light of the almighty Bitcoin and the Heavenly graces it bestows.
@_date: 2018-02-08 20:37:44
Was that you asking for a follow and he said No sir? lol...
@_date: 2018-02-06 19:32:01
Time for BTC to Zoom. Zoom.
@_date: 2018-02-24 19:59:56
What if God was one of us?
Just a slob like one of us
Just a stranger on the bus
Tryin' to make his way home?
Just tryin' to make his way home
Like a holy rolling stone
Back up to heaven all alone
Just tryin' to make his way home
Nobody callin' on the phone
'Cept for the Pope maybe in Rome
@_date: 2018-02-11 23:29:09
Asia awakens and so goes down the prices again. Hopefully will be up again by morning.
@_date: 2018-02-21 01:14:41
Blessed are we to hear thy words of wisdom oh Great Prophet of Bitcorn! Praise ye be!
@_date: 2018-03-07 03:48:07
Can't wait for the doom and gloom brigade to kick into full gear. Unless they have all been banned...
@_date: 2018-02-07 03:23:49
My purchase took 10 days. Takes forever and they said instant transfers were coming.
@_date: 2018-02-23 12:40:28
Can't wait for those sadistic trolls to say all those 6k down down posts again. Too bad they went into hibernation.
@_date: 2018-03-07 01:37:01
Seems like but too early to call. Holding my four leaf clover, rosary, lucky horseshoe, and rabbit's foot hopefully they give us more luck and blessings.
@_date: 2018-02-28 13:06:45
One thing that I am certain is that everything crypto is STRESSFUL, especially Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-02-21 04:21:57
Thank goodness for support at 10.7k.
@_date: 2018-02-08 01:57:58
Just don't mind the 2 week old trolls wishing for a drop. Feeble-minded people who are bitter that they didn't buy during the dip. HODL all the way!
@_date: 2018-02-10 02:42:58
You snooze, you lose.
@_date: 2018-02-09 22:59:10
Somebody should lend the Bitcoin starship a transwarp drive. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 12:47:26
I pray too and grab my lucky rabbit's foot, lucky Horseshoe, and four leaf clover whenever there is a dip.
@_date: 2018-03-16 00:50:05
Another hiccup / fart or is it a full dump?
@_date: 2018-02-10 00:47:41
Then after 9k lets skyrocket to 10k.
@_date: 2018-02-23 14:55:55
So let the sunshine in
Face it with a grin
Smilers never lose
And frowners never win
So let the sunshine in
Face it with a grin
Open up your heart
And let the sunshine in...
@_date: 2018-03-12 01:25:09
Now where are those doomsday redditors now?
@_date: 2018-02-07 16:00:42
Apparently, these noob members are only puppet troll accounts. Indeed, time does tell who you are.
@_date: 2018-02-06 20:17:15
Because the dead cat had more than Nine Lives at its disposal.
@_date: 2018-02-21 03:43:47
It is blasphemy
@_date: 2018-03-12 01:50:49
Expect anything to happen. Just another day of BTC and crypto world.
@_date: 2018-03-31 20:11:01
or never
@_date: 2018-03-09 06:28:05
Repent for the end is near! 
@_date: 2018-02-24 18:39:53
Looks like more selling with that long red dildo. ��
@_date: 2018-02-25 20:53:48
Or maybe not regarding the dump not the 15k. Hell yeah about that.
@_date: 2018-03-30 18:38:58
Just make it twice a day to be exact. 
@_date: 2018-03-16 20:18:27
Hasnt happened today, maybe it doesnt happen on Fridays or the weekends or maybe... We cant notice it because markets are stronger on these days.
@_date: 2018-02-12 16:33:51
Nada. Unfortunately, those times have passed. 
@_date: 2018-02-07 23:16:20
I hope you're right. [Think positive thoughts] I'll just squeeze my Rabbit's foot and cross my fingers for good luck for the next hour.
@_date: 2018-02-09 17:58:48
It's flyin' high.
@_date: 2018-02-09 04:32:19
Does Bitcoin act as bad as the old lady in that commercial as well?
@_date: 2018-03-10 17:40:15
Must be that damn trustee again. Could somebody help put an end to this please?
@_date: 2018-03-09 01:51:43
Is there any respite for us or shall we just run for the hills?
@_date: 2018-03-09 05:24:58
Sleep tight. May we all dream that by morning things will be better. I sure will.
@_date: 2018-02-06 22:34:31
If any more FUDs arise, that should be a good indicator. Otherwise, 8k will be fine.
@_date: 2018-03-02 15:31:48
There are already a lot of pyramid scam Multi-level marketing companies using Bitcoin as a means of duping people into investing in them. 
@_date: 2018-02-22 16:32:54
Why not be an example and do it yourself first?
@_date: 2018-02-25 15:47:22
Wait till the Sunday sell off later. Might get brutal.
@_date: 2018-02-08 22:13:46
Just love these all caps doomsday noob posters. 
@_date: 2018-02-10 22:48:01
and then it goes back up.
@_date: 2018-02-19 21:23:08
Just don't say "Winter is Coming" for Cryptos.
@_date: 2018-03-11 05:14:41
Yes it will. BE POSITIVE! [Even when bitcoin goes down].
@_date: 2018-03-14 22:21:41
oh crud... ��
@_date: 2018-02-09 23:12:44
Coz we're on the edge of glory...
@_date: 2018-02-09 21:18:57
And their Kimchi...
@_date: 2018-07-17 17:59:32
AMEN and Hallelujah!
@_date: 2018-02-11 23:45:53
How about Europe?
@_date: 2018-04-24 12:01:49
Oh I totally agree with you in that. Learned a lot over the course of the 1st Quarter 2018 with regards to BTC and cryptos. Lost 70% of what I put in [in paper that is] and now like most of us am in the recovery. 
@_date: 2018-04-15 15:25:59
Did George Soros just fart?
@_date: 2018-04-24 12:00:13
We have all survived. The strong remain.
