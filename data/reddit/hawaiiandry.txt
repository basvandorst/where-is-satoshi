Under Japanese bankruptcy law, payouts can only be made in yen. So, all of our lost Bitcoin claims were converted to ~48500 yen ($485) each. However, as you know, BTC is worth a liiiiiiiiittle more than that now. So, by law, all of the excess has to go to Mark Karpeles.
So, there are now a few groups of creditors who are petitioning the court to stop the bankruptcy proceedings and instead start civil rehabilitation proceedings, which will get around that loophole and allow the remaining BTC to be distributed to us directly.
Wish me luck &gt;.&lt;

The problem runs much deeper than Bitcoin adoption. The best way to help is to support any efforts for STEM adoption among young women. Gender disparity in Bitcoin will follow the same trend as gender disparity in technology as a whole. If, generations from now, the percentage of female doctors, mechanics, programmers, etc, has significantly increased, you'll see a similar increase in Bitcoin adoption among women.

I've been a system admin for years, and this is one of the most well constructed phishing attempts I've ever seen. Not just from a technical standpoint, but from a social engineering standpoint as well. Notice that all these emails are being sent to "David"...remember Wallet Recovery Services, run by a man named David? The scammer is going to get lucky, as someone will think they've inadvertently received an email meant for him. Combined with the fact that the payload is in plaintext, it'll slip right through a good portion of spam filters.

We sometimes discuss Bitcoin over in (mostly due to Cryptolocker), and it's the same deal.
Didn't have a robust backup solution for your network? Well, too bad. You (the sysadmin) are supposed to be on top of these things.
It's the same for personal security as well. If someone wants to become involved in Bitcoin but doesn't know what HTTPS is, then we've got an uphill battle. Bitcoin's only been around a few years, and it's still in beta, thus it requires some technical knowledge. It'll get easier over time, as the demand for easier ways to use Bitcoin goes up.

Remember the cost of electricity. If your miner needs a kilowatt power supply, electricity costs you 13 cents/hour, and you run it 24/7, you'd blow roughly $93/mo extra on your power bill. That's over $2200 for two years of mining.
I did the calculations for myself, and it was something like $100 worth of BTC mined per month, and $100.30 per month extra on electricity.

I remember in college, they taught us how arbitrage works, and showed us the financial section of the New York Times, and various financial websites to get us accustomed to it.
I noticed that every source always listed Ecuador as 1:1 with the US dollar. Looking online, I realized it wasn't just a coincidence - Ecuador actually uses the same greenbacks that the US does.
This left one burning question in my mind. I raised my hand one day, and asked my professor: "if Ecuador uses US dollars, why is the 1:1 exchange rate listed every day in the New York Times?" My professor looked at me for a few seconds, and said "you know, HawaiianDry, I have no clue."

It depends on the specific exchange, but they all have a "withdraw" or a "send" feature to get your coins over to a different address. As far as generating a cold storage address, there are also a few different ways. You can go to bitaddress.org, download the code, run it on a computer that's not connected to the internet, and get your public and private keys. Withdraw your coins from the exchange to your new public key, and there you go. Even though your new address has never been online, it can still receive transactions. Only once you move the coins out of that address (hopefully to buy a house!) will the address no longer be "cold" storage.

They're one of many media outlets that picked up the story. Basically, as soon as Cypriot officials floated the idea of levying every bank account, people panicked. Over in Spain, Bitcoin interest skyrocketed, and thousands of people started to download Bitcoin apps and issue buy orders.
On the same day, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) issued their first public acknowledgement of Bitcoin (although they just referred to "virtual currencies" in general), treating them more fairly then a lot of people expected.
Those are the main reasons for the colossal spike.

About offline wallet generation:
Let's say I generate an address offline, for long term storage. Then using my regular wallet, I send a Bitcoin to the offline wallet. Obviously, to get the coin back in the future, I'm going to need to import the offline wallet, using the private key that was generated initially.
In the meantime, I mention to my less-than-scrupulous friend that I used Offline Wallet Generator Program X to do this entire thing, and I also let slip the address where I have my Bitcoin. What's to stop him from generating the same address, in order to find the private key?
My initial thought is "well, he'd probably get a different private key, thanks to the randomization in the private key generation". But that doesn't seem to make sense either, because then how would the Bitcoin network know that my private key is the correct one, when it wasn't synced to the network at the time of creation?
And why didn't I pay more attention in college?

This is a situation in which it would be better to wait and see what happens.
We know there's going to be a huge leap in processing power - currently there's about 50 terahashes/second on the network. Even one of their highest-end ASICs is going to bump that to 51.5. There are people with MUCH more money than you and me invested in this who are salivating, just waiting to plug in their shiny new boxes in a few weeks. The difficulty is going to go through the roof to accommodate the change. Suddenly, 30 gigahashes/second is going to seem like a drop in the ocean.
The short version of the story is wait until ASICs are available without a preorder, and then use a mining calculator once the difficulty stopped rocketing to the moon. If it's still profitable to do it, then go for it. But right now, you stand to get screwed.

Solely the transaction fees. However, the goal is that by 2140, Bitcoin adoption should be saturated and the mining rewards will be miniscule, so the fees will actually be the main draw.
I'm betting it will actually be some point well before 2140 when the transaction fees become more profitable than the mining itself.

I sometimes find opened ones on Ebay, but they still go for over a thousand dollars. I can't believe how much physical coins will go for. Right now I've got some CryptoVest litecoins on there. They sell (empty) for $3, a Litecoin costs about $18, and I haven't had one sell for less than $40.

Well, I'll share my opinions on a few of your points.
First, I'm open to altcoins, but I tend to stick with the ones that offer some sort of tech innovation. Will we come to prefer Scrypt coins over SHA? Will the market come to shun proof of work for proof of stake? Not to mention the wildly divergent coins like Namecoin, which aim to do something else entirely. I would argue that Namecoin is capable of doing for DNS what Bitcoin is capable of doing for money transfers. I'll admit there are a few attractive "fun" coins out there, but unless they actually do something different, I probably won't pay them much mind.
And this next one is also just my opinion, but for me, Bitcoin stopped being "fun" as soon as it got past $50. Many of us in this subreddit have a lot riding on this. What was just a hobby has become a major source of stress and potential gain. I'm not against some of the things in here, like and "spartans hold!", but all in all, I come to for quick, timely news updates.
Hope that makes sense :)
@_date: 2013-02-07 19:45:32
Nice. It reminds me of a post here a few weeks back about buying groceries with Bitcoins, since that's seen by a lot of people as the litmus test of whether a currency is usable day to day.
This could go a long way towards it.

All you have to do is open up a Dwolla account, provide photo ID, wait for the account to be verified, open up a MtGox account, provide photo ID, wait for the account to be verified, link your bank account to your Dwolla account, wait for it to verify, initiate a payment from your bank account to Dwolla, wait for it to clear, initiate a payment from Dwolla to MtGox, then place an order on MtGox!

I bought 15 bitcoins on a whim when I first heard about it. I didn't really think it was going to go anywhere. Granted, now I wish I had bought 1500 of them, but at the very least they're worth a month's rent and bills now.

Just ask if you can watch the screen of their phone or laptop. You want to make sure they're actually putting through the transaction, and not just hitting random keys.
Yep, all you need is cash and an address.

There is supposed to be a tamper-evident sticker on the back. The sticker has the first eight characters of the Bitcoin address assigned to the coin (which is sufficient to uniquely identify the coin). The address's private key is located on the underside of the sticker, and thus cannot be examined without voiding it.
The specific coins I have are blank - they were cheap to buy, but contain no Bitcoins.

The creators posted about it on this subreddit a month or so ago. I checked out their website, thebitcoincatalog.com, and put in an order.
Unfortunately, it's not free...it's actually quite expensive, considering that catalogs (a book of advertisements) are usually free. But I thought I'd help out, I think one of the biggest barriers to wider Bitcoin adoption is that there is a significant learning curve.

That's the part I don't understand. They didn't change their name, so wouldn't they still be the Magic the Gathering Online Exchange? I mean, it's cool if a company wants to change their name, but they could at least say "hey guys just to let you know, our name now stands for Making Thousands by Generating Online Exchanges" or something.

Ouch. I would suggest forensic data recovery (~5k to get back ~70k), but I'm guessing you already have given the matter extensive attention. At least you've got multiple safeguards going forward.

Great job on the PaperCoins. It's a little tough to get that final fold, but they end up looking pretty slick nonetheless.
My suggestion has to do with Papercoin.org itself - if someone is using PaperCoins to introduce someone to Bitcoin, it would help to have some links on the website to get them started down the path. Obviously, having a paper wallet is awesome, and helps to overcome one of the first main questions about Bitcoin ("what do you mean it's a virtual currency?"), but they'll obviously want to learn more. At that point, being able to click around to everything that they'll need would be convenient.
