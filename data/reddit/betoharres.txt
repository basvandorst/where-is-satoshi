If he is confusing people because he wants then thats is a very stupid move from him, he is just burning he's image for free.

really? the dude is doing a big deal about 1GB block in 15 years. Seriously, 1GB will be nothing in 15years, not to mention the time we will have to come up with a clever idea of not increasing the block that much.
Also, what's up with that thing about choosing a tx that's is worth? wtf?

I'm not saying that. I'm saying that apps can and should be able to support multiple coins, it's obvious that he wants to push BCH to be known as "The Bitcoin", but people should not be triggered by a wallet that supports the 2 coins

you're open to counterarguments but the mods aren't, so I will just stay quiet

sorry bro i was on crack, shit it's fun to smoke and buy bitcoin; very good combination
@_date: 2017-11-09 14:36:00
thanks for the TLDR
@_date: 2017-11-20 13:04:38
given your description, that's not a scam, it's a UI/UX flaw based on your words, I haven't downloaded and you haven't showed us any proof(screenshot) to base your arguments, oh wait, that's 99% of the arguments here!

are you saying Bitcoin Cash is a bubble? you know... like Bitcoin? hum...
@_date: 2017-11-23 18:03:34
the problem is that BTC development is centralized in a group, it shouldn't be this way. They decided to implement segwit, and as software developer I don't agree with that, I vote for bigger blocks thus not upgrading my BTC wallet to segwit and migrating to BCH.
I really hate this war, sometimes I get in but I regret every time. We should just let people choose their path without pointing fingers at their face.

The 1st bomb that I told you has dropped with ViaBTC, I thinks there's more to come.
@_date: 2017-10-25 17:25:39
I wasn't talking about 4 months long transactions
@_date: 2017-09-21 17:54:17
yea yea, but remember, russia is not a cool guy by doing this, they know they can have the mining power china have, and they want to control it

"hey everyone, here are centralized references about a decentralized world."
@_date: 2017-09-14 15:02:45
I dunno if this helps but, I think china will come up with 2 other bombs that will drop the price even more. 
It feels like they're fighting to a price drop, and 20% is not enough

You know what "does not determine what is Bitcoin"? High fees.

Thanks a lot for the complet instruction, I've installed Electrum on my desktop, but for some reason I still use kriptokit.
I'm interested about the topic you mentioned:


I could not fully understand what you mean, do you have any link that I could look at it?
I have some background in programming and encryption, if that helps.
@_date: 2017-05-12 17:05:12
just updated the client, thanks a lot!
@_date: 2017-05-13 05:13:28
Hello, after 5 hours trying to figure this out, I finnally did it! Thanks a lot for the help, it did helped me! I used the  offilne version to get my private ket and load it in electrum, thank god it worked. Thanks again
@_date: 2017-05-12 16:31:38


Thanks! I've Electrum in my computer, but because I never had any suggestion that it was good I decided to stick with kriptokit. Thanks a lot
@_date: 2017-05-16 04:23:55
They guy said that you "buy a wallet on the internet"
@_date: 2017-05-12 16:18:28
Hello, thanks for answering. 
I'm currently using kriptokit, but I don't think the client should have any effect on this since you just input the current value that was given to you.
@_date: 2017-05-12 16:19:39


Hello, could you link the one that you use? I'm planning to migrate.
@_date: 2017-05-13 23:33:25
don't talk shit, my last 6 transactions are stuck, I'd make more but I'm afraid of loose money.
@_date: 2017-05-12 16:18:42
Thank, I guess
@_date: 2017-05-12 16:29:49
Sure, that is what I was looking for, sure I was angry while writing this, and still am, but I didn't know who the fault was. If what you say is true, than the fault is totally mine, plus the ignorance of not knowing that the freaking wallet can make my purchase take decades.
If I knew that from the start, I'd never use the wallet that I'm using it right now, nor write this post.
@_date: 2017-07-21 13:38:59
sigh...
