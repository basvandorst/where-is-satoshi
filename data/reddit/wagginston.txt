A city-state has every reason to like Bitcoin. Most of their trade must be done internationally, and Bitcoin avoids many barriers to international trade.

MOM laughed when I told her about it on the phone. :D

We do have a virtual event kind of like that. The International Hangout allows people having simultaneous CoinFests anywhere in the world to show off what they've planned via livestream, and link to their individual feeds. Edmonton and Winnipeg will do this, and we will have a moderator and speakers in other parts of the world.

This is why we need to work hard to educate the public about Bitcoin. Nathan_Flomm is correct in that the best way to do this is by creating a thriving marketplace--people understand what they can see, and they don't often see Bitcoin in their daily lives. In Vancouver, I've been throwing events that demonstrate the use of bitcoins, and intentionally holding them for free at BTC-accepting venues to incentivize adoption. I launched a convention called CoinFest that I've been helping Bitcoiners in other cities to replicate, such as Edmonton, Winnipeg, Calgary, and Puerto Vallarta. You should try it.

I don't think I could bring myself to reciprocate love from a girl who hates Bitcoin tattoos, anyways.

I'm super happy with it! Gonna take pics when this plastic bandage thing is off.
@_date: 2014-01-30 05:26:34
I'm not doing it for the money! It's to prove that I'm foolishly in love with Bitcoin.

More importantly, Jackson Warren is defending the title of Bitcoin at the Cross-Currency Panel during the CoinFest Conference. Put those altcoins in their places!

Aww, somebody just beat me to it. I'm still gonna get the tattoo, though. It was part of the deal for him to accept Bitcoin.

We're working on it! The Bitcoin Cooperative and its friends like Bitcoiniacs been signing up businesses to use Bitcoin left and right. Publicity helps us do that. If you want to help, you can follow us on Facebook 0:)

The Bitcoin businesses out West are mostly using the Bitcoin Co-op's POS, which has no fees at all and includes fiat conversion at no cost. I doubt any of the restaurants/pubs/clubs/cafes etc I host events for could be convinced to switch to this paid service. Everybody already has the wallet apps necessary to pay at these places the traditional (for cryptocurrency) way.

We have probably around 100 people coming to the CoinFest. Maybe more? We'll find out, tomorrow. There's going to be a conference held from 12-3 PM, and Piotre Piasecki will be showing off some cool Casascius coins and give a way a few promos as freebees. New wallets with printed QR codes were prepared by MatchMaker and Riku from Bitcoin Co-op, who have been a lot of help.
Also, check out the awesome AFTERPARTY. The most popular musician at the preceding CoinFest will play for us at around 9 PM. Various appetizers will be prepared for $15 worth of BTC, or $20 in fiat. You can learn more on Facebook:

The Quadriga exchange that just opened on Monday counts as "reputable," I think. They have a physical location in Vancouver that started accepting both Bitcoin and Litecoin as of Monday. Over 150k worth of bitcoins and 80k worth of litecoins traded in 72 hours.

I think they hate Bitcoin, but let's find out :P

Gurmeet, one of the family owners of India Gate in Vancouver and who works with a partner in Puero Vallarta, had told me they take Bitcoin, now. He has now clarified with the following message:
" Partner has a day off today.
What happened yesterday is that he was not there, and have not told staff how to use it. 
By Tuesday we hope to have everything sorted our as Monday is a holiday.
Please write this number as the contact number (Elias)"

Who is this guy that keeps giving us shout outs? :) I owe you a Meet Up treat.

He traded way more Bitcoin, though! I guess for a couple days there were no other options on the West coast for Litecoin trading, so it makes sense that they had high Litecoin volume.
