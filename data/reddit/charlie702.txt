I'm quite impressed that they own circle.com.  That likely wasn't cheap.

Does your verification still require a fax or mail?   I understand not emailing, but uploading documents would seem to be secure enough.  And help increase registrations. 
Regardless,  great work! 
As for making you laugh...Q:  What does a pushy pepper do?  A: gets jalapeño business! (and,  ideally,  accepts bitcoin for said business ;) )

Damn straight. I always wanted to do that, man. And I think if I had 100 bitcoins I could hook that up, too; 'cause chicks dig dudes with bitcoins.

Deals on Casascius Coins in 0.5 and 0.1 denominations. Might be just what you are looking for.
(This is my site btw)

I can confirm that logging in with "admin does not work.
Though I didn't try the "god" password.....yet....

It's a baby Jesus miracle!
@_date: 2013-10-29 16:48:19
haha!  no kidding!
It also makes me realize that there are people with many thousands that cost virtually nothing.

Ooooooo..... Litecoin (and other alts).   Doesn't appear to be directly trade-able just yet.  Can you tell us more on that?

A little shameless self-promotion.
I've got some deals on remaining stock of 0.1 silver and 0.5 brass Casascius physical bitcoins at RealCrypto.com.  (Also, the site is on the Bitcoin Black Friday list under "gifts" btw)
The best deal is the 5 pack of 0.1 silver coins for ~1 bitcoin with free shipping.  I think these are a great holiday gift.

Not communicating is not okay.  People are patient if they feel a resolution is being worked toward.  Thank you for the update.
@_date: 2013-05-02 04:25:39
And now that I actually read the update on the site....I have to ask, is that REALLY all you've got?  Also, I thought a check was already sent?
@_date: 2013-04-18 21:00:25
Well that information is WAY better than gold :)
Great looking site btw!

I did not know that!  Honestly, that does it for me.  It's donation time.  
And anyone else who was seriously "saved" by Internet Credit Union sticking its neck out to facilitate the return of Bitfloor funds, has to feel the same way.
