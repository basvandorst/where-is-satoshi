Don't you hate it when you buy some thing for 20% off, only to find out it's 50% off the next day?

I think they do, but require more than a lifetime, so it is not meant as an investment. If you have a passion for watches, then sure get a fancy one with your money, enjoy and treasure it for your life it would be worth while, however more often than not, when buying things people enjoy for some time and then forget about them.

Ah, great, was thinking I had it wrong for a moment

Using your logic it will never recover, nor would the price of anything ever

I've been buying high and selling low  isn't that how I should be doing it?
@_date: 2018-11-20 09:27:17
And that doesn't explain shit either, why do these people think it will go lower?
