I know I know, I'm one of those idiots who didn't make a backup, I made the transfers from local BitCoin to block chain on a friends laptop. I'm trying to get hold of him to search his history. 
I suppose if I don't get it back I'll just have to learn from the consequences!  
@_date: 2013-10-19 15:23:56
Haha I have indeed!

Maybe an option to also display the amount of BitCoin the user owns in a chosen currency. Similar to btc report.

Is it me or is this article false? (Not the Bloomberg one) He's saying China is dumping its reserves? When really they're just not increasing it?

There are multiple companies that do this in the UK and I imagine a few around the globe. They're third party, either employed by the new tenant, landlord or estate agent and considered to be unbiased. I worked for one for about 10 months.

This is moronic.

I'm guessing you're the dev? 
@_date: 2013-11-13 22:30:48
No, but I don't see anyone in the property business taking on btc in the near future.

Back in! Blockchain customer services are pretty good. 
@_date: 2013-10-19 11:43:56
Yes, this gives me my password but not my identifier or alias. By wallet number I mean number that this is the number you send bitcoins to for making global payments. not specific number for blockchain accounts. 
EDIT: All I need is my blockchain identifier or alias then I'll be fine. Surely blockchain customer services will be able to give me that?

This is the same as me saying: if BitCoin is $0 dollars and worthless in 10 years it is.

Should have expected that. 
Anyone know why it happened?
