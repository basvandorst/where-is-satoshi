How is this so clear to you? 
People are financially and emotionally heavily invested in bitcoin. Why is it so unlikely that people have different opinions than you and are very passionate about it?

But in the end you could boild down everything down to time. 1 Earth apple is the time of 1 earth apple growing + the time of the Earth work. 1 Q Apple is the time 1 Q Apple needs.
This doesn't change with bitcoin, even if it's supply is fixed to time. The question of how much time does it cost to create a similar system still persist.
And time is a terrible valuesystem. Your time might be worth more of my time. 
Sorry if I talk beside your point, but I really don't understand what you are trying to say with your blogpost.

I don't understand the beginning with the alien trade.
Why would the Qasniuqians exchange a 50 year old Qasniuqians with a 50 year old human?
They only would do that to prepare to trade later on I guess. But this implies that we have something that they would lake to trade with their human. And it is also implied that they have something that we would like to trade with our Qasniuqian. 
Why not trade those things directly? Why trade 'time'?

Can you link me the data? I don't go on reddit everyday. Maybe I have missed it.




I don't understand how this relates to alleged fake voting.

Okay I read through the post of and he said he has *mild* evidence. 
Can't you see where I'm coming from? I don't have the same information at my disposal as I don't know if there is a big lack of big block proponents at community meetups. That's why I ask you for the clear evidence that you have.
I don't understand why my account age is relevant. I've been around here for five years, but this is completly irrelevant. I'm not making big claims, I just want to understand your viewpoint.
Personally I believe is in a similar situation as Many people very angry about something, posting their opinions, and are winning the upvote wars by outnumbering opposing views.
Don't think there is necessary much botting or fake account voting going on.
