Hey thanks, I don't think this applies because we do accept bitcoins.
I'm looking for a better solution to paying 15%+ in credit card processing fees

And on a Nexus 7 Android tablet nonetheless.

And yet porn doesn't just make itself! It's one of the major things we're trying to address with this site.. It's a fair question. 
Understand that the majority of the "free stuff" is actually "pay stuff" that people paid for and spread around the net without permission. I mean why ever buy music when there's YouTube and the radio? Why buy movies when you can watch through the window of your neighbour's apartment? ;)
By paying you're supporting the artists who created it, funding more production, getting a higher quality full length product, not stealing, etc etc etc.

The actresses make most of their money from the studios though... I mean they don't *have* to work for anybody, that's their choice. They can make money on their own by camming, or building their own site, or stripping, etc.. By accepting work from porn sites they augment their income. For many it's their only income source because they prefer it. 
Running your own site and finding your own customers is hard work. Most models just want to show up (a bit late...) for their shoot, get paid and drive home. :) 
But you make a good point, and we may have some "direct to model" themed bundles in our future where they supply their own content.

Hey, as I just [posted here]( there's really no preview, but here's a few images of what the members area looks like. 
@_date: 2015-02-16 18:03:57
? we raised over $7,000 for charity last month, and we use their exact same model of 65/20/15. We are just an extension of their model, in an area of business they would never get into. 
Porn has a long storied tradition of parody!
@_date: 2015-02-16 12:57:00
We've had the opposite happen. 7.46% of our sales have been made with crypto currencies. [Made a thread about it here.](
@_date: 2015-02-19 13:56:09
Hey, we were asked by a number of people to post more detailed stats, and our developer couldn't get to it the same day. We promised a follow up post with more details. Just delivering on that. 
@_date: 2015-02-16 12:55:24
We've done exactly 2,251 sales so far, and 168 of those were paid for with BTC/LTC/DOGE. 
That's 7.46%! Wow. That's pretty shocking to me. 
Bundle  just launched 2 days ago, and we've seen quite a few repeat purchases using crypto currencies. We also offer Dwolla (US bank account purchases) but it's much less popular than crypto for us. 
We use GoCoin and have been very pleased with the service so far. 
Interested to learn how we can market to the bitcoin community, and what sites might accept our posts or links. 
How can we get the bitcoin community to pick up our story? Any bloggers that might write about us? Youtubers that might make a video about us? Anyone who might do an interview or something? 
Our biggest challenge so far has been to have the message spread to news sites, blogs, etc. Any help we can get with that appreciated. 
Happy to answer any questions!
@_date: 2015-02-17 03:09:48
Okay buddy. Obvious troll is obvious.
@_date: 2015-02-16 16:58:02
Looking into this and will respond. 
Edit: Our dev said he's swamped with the launch but will get to it soon, I'll try to make a follow up post tomorrow with detailed stats on payment breakdown, average price crypto vs USD, and anything else we can think of. 
@_date: 2015-02-16 19:31:54
lol no. :) We are a parody of the Humble Bundle. 
Our first sale we had 3 great charities: The Foundation for Sex Positive Culture, Able Gamers, and Angel's Giving Tree. 
All charities are 501(c)3 registered charities. 
Some proof: 
@_date: 2015-02-17 02:30:19
I'm not sure if we're really allowed to put their name on our site, and I don't want to go poking the bear. They've been really nice to us so far! We love the Humble Bundle and see this as an extension of their business model to do more good. 
Could have done a better job with the title of this thread, you're right. :) 
@_date: 2015-02-17 01:57:51
We have an affiliate program (the most crude one you've ever seen, mind you...) and we'll give you our tip money on the sales you generate, and show you how much you've raised for charity. Send me a message and I'll set you up!
@_date: 2015-02-17 02:02:13
Thanks! Will try to reproduce. 
@_date: 2015-02-16 19:13:00
I'll be 100% honest with you here. 
Our first bundle was $12 for the third tier, basically because that's what Humble was doing at the time we launched. 
What ended up happening is our average shot up to around $9, and so everyone was buying at $12 and nobody was paying the average. Why have an average price point if nobody chooses it?
So we thought alright, lets put the price up and create a middle ground.... 
And then yesterday our average was almost $15.50. People are still mostly paying $18, $20, and $25. 
We're not sure what to make of it, or what to do. 
As for anonymity, we don't verify e-mail addresses. However we do e-mail keys to them, so you'd need to get in touch with proof of purchase and we'll send you your key. 
If there's a better way to make it anonymous we're listening
@_date: 2015-02-17 02:28:26
Fair point. We'll work on that, but I think some of the magic is also not knowing 100% what you get. Kind of a mystery box. :)
If you hover your mouse over the thumbnails, they scroll through the scenes, but it is just a picture of each scene. 
Here's screenshots of our members areas, long ones taken with Snagit.

@_date: 2015-02-17 02:09:45
Awesome. PS: We were asked by an LGBT charity whether we'd be condom-only on the gay side, because they promote safe sex. I asked around, and it seems the community is very divided on the issue, but the non-condom crowd is smaller and very vocal. 
What do you think we should do? 
I feel like I'm being a bit of a jerk by mandating condoms for gay porn, and not for straight porn.... Like safe sex is safe sex... right? But...
@_date: 2015-02-16 18:05:03
I know right? They probably paid a developer to implement it, got overcharged, paid a few grand for a few hours of work, and didn't get the return they expected. But then... why pay again to remove it? :) 
@_date: 2015-02-16 13:39:56
I've run adult websites for a long time, and I've heard that around 1% of sales is common for people who accept it. Many say it's not worth it, or they tried it and it didn't work. 
Happy to report I have no idea what they're talking about. :) Almost 8% across 2,000+ sales is crazy. 
@_date: 2015-02-16 19:15:22
lol.. Honestly I wouldn't be surprised, there's some shady shit that happens in the porn business.
I just believe if you respect your customers (even if they're filthy perverts just like us) you'll do better in the long run. 
@_date: 2015-02-17 02:19:01
I'm proud of you. ;) 
@_date: 2015-02-16 16:53:46
It's for charity! And I'll never understand why it's completely acceptable to steal from pornographers when they create the media that many of us enjoy the most. The "support artists" thing just doesn't seem to extend to pornographers. 
59% of our exit survey respondents from Bundle  said it was their first time paying for porn, ever. 
@_date: 2015-02-17 02:03:56
Lots of bitcoin sales today. :) We're going to do a follow up post with more detailed stats tomorrow for everyone, comparing crypto to fiat purchases, and we'll include # of sales made today from this post.
@_date: 2015-02-16 19:37:06
You make some really good points. I think it's something we should consider, even just because they're useful and come in handy, plus like you said it's great to support what supports you back. 
However our site was not easy to make. We're a parody of a site that's done over $200 million in sales, and had almost $5 million in venture capital. We needed to make something comparable in quality, look and most importantly user experience, and it was really hard. :) We did all this with just 3 dudes, a dollar and a dream. 
I know for certain it would affect our whole accounting system and $ splits etc etc. 
But honestly I want what you want too, and we'll get there at some point soon. 
@_date: 2015-02-17 02:38:12
lol that'd be awesome.. We do have plans for micro niches like that. 
Every bundle we do we pay a really good illustrator for an original header cartoon of sexy girls. One good girl, one bad girl. Good + Evil, Porn + Charity, etc. 
Imagine the furry one?? :D
@_date: 2015-02-16 19:05:30
Rules on rules?! :D 
@_date: 2015-02-16 16:55:54
Someone could share us at if they felt like it...  :)
@_date: 2015-02-16 18:06:59
I know it will be unpopular, but the truth is we hold 0%. This is because we're holding onto money for charities, and we can't force them to "play the market" with their money while they wait to get paid out. 
@_date: 2015-02-17 01:55:19
Second time we've heard this name, can you tell me more? I don't know what they do. 
Thanks for the kind words, 
@_date: 2015-02-16 19:06:26
GoCoin doesn't let us divide up sales like that. We'd have to set a % to keep in crypto and make a guess about what people tip us. People can tip us 0% of their sale, or 100% of their sale, and anything in between. 
@_date: 2015-02-16 13:54:32
Very interesting.. Do you think that the Canadian dollar is competition to the US dollar?
As a business, I see accepting more payment methods as doing a service to our customers. To me, I'm not "supporting litecoin" I'm servicing our customers. 
The only side I want to take is my customer's. 
@_date: 2015-02-17 02:12:48
Hey thanks. :) We only make an (optional!) 15% tip, so we're not diving into gold coins yet, but we have some plans in place to offer things that give us a bit higher margin and help us along. 
I really appreciate the kind words. When we got into this we were expecting a lot of hate from people very loyal to Humble Bundle, but it just hasn't happened. Honestly, most of the assumptions we had while making the site were completely wrong. :) 
@_date: 2015-02-17 02:14:56
Yes, we bundle together content from a number of high profile adult websites and sell them on a pay-what-you-want model. You choose the price, and you choose who gets your money. You can give 100% to charity if you choose (or the sites, or us!) or any ratio you want. 
The videos and photos can be downloaded or streamed from our members area, and once you buy something it's unlocked in your account forever. If you log back in a year from now, the content you bought will still be there for you. 
@_date: 2015-02-17 02:19:16
We live to serve (porn). 
@_date: 2015-02-19 13:42:45
[We posted here the other day]( and got a great response. It definitely caused our sales to jump!
We promised to look into our Crypto VS Fiat stats more closely, and to give a breakdown of the different Crypto coins being spent at our site.

@_date: 2015-02-16 17:21:03
Yes, this is a big reason. 
All sales at Hump the Bundle are one time payments. If we want you back next month, we have to earn it. 
@_date: 2015-02-16 19:02:56
Ooooooooooooh. has a very restrictive advertising policy in place, and we try to follow the rules at Reddit.. But this could work I'll have a look today, many thanks. 
@_date: 2015-02-16 19:05:01
We don't verify e-mail addresses, but we do send your access keys there. If you want to signup with a fake e-mail that's fine, but you'll have to send us a message to get your key (with proof of payment). 
@_date: 2015-02-16 16:55:33
I'm not sure I'll ask my dev and get back to you!
Edit: No, it's custom. But we do use video.js. :)
@_date: 2015-02-16 17:03:38
Hrmmm.. It's likely a difference in audience, and the fact that our bundles aren't expensive. You can buy for as low as $1 and try it out. Also the anonymity, and it's just a cool thing to buy. 
We're a parody of Humble Bundle, so part of it might be that people are used to paying one way there, and just extend that to us as well. Habit. 
Having said that, I haven't noticed a big difference in sale prices between credit cards and USD. It seems people with crypto are just as likely to buy tier 3 access. I'll look into that and maybe do a follow up post about the differences between crypto and fiat users on our site. 
@_date: 2015-02-16 16:52:19
Yes, it was just easier to deal with one integration rather than 3. 
@_date: 2015-02-17 02:35:48
Yes, we make deals with the sites in advance and have full permission to use their content. 
It wasn't easy to get them signed up at first. They were very skeptical, and were taking a big risk by letting us do this. We collect the money and then pay them, and they're not used to that. Also what if we didn't pay the charities?
I strategically chose our first 2 partners because I felt they both knew each other, are from the same city, and could maybe share the risk a bit. I knew they'd talk about it together. And I knew if I got one the other would follow suit.
We literally needed approval from 12 different groups to get our first sale going. :) As an entrepreneur who just wants to "go", it was not easy doing all that. 
The adult industry these days is a tough business. Back in the day the money just fell from the sky. Now you have to really work hard.
@_date: 2015-02-16 16:50:59
The soccer guy chose the wording.. I made sure to clarify in my post. :) I don't think it's any less impressive, if it was 168 BTC worth, that'd be double our sales total almost! So the title removes all doubt. 
@_date: 2015-02-17 02:24:45
We thought the exact same thing. This, like many of our other assumptions, were completely wrong. How can we sell milk when they're giving away cows? How do we deal with the idea that "porn is free" when that thought is so pervasive an widespread today?
Why do people pay more for something when they can get the same thing for less?
This is a super interesting business model, we're learning a lot, and innovating best we can. Our first sale, the content expired after 30 days. People told us that sucked... So we listened, we spoke to our partners, we made new deals, and now people have access forever. 
Our site is now the "steam + humble" of porn, combined.. In 2 months. 
It's been a lot of fun and I'm really proud of my team. 
@_date: 2015-02-17 02:01:52
As a teenager I once asked an old guy at what age 17 year old girls stop being attractive, as if that could ever happen. 
He told me when my daughter turns 17. ;)
@_date: 2015-02-16 17:24:21
Ahem! We are indeed Rule 34. 
Our site is a porn parody of Humble Bundle.. So now there's porn of that. :) 
@_date: 2015-02-19 18:31:05
Thanks we'll get that fixed. 
@_date: 2015-02-17 01:56:21
Absolutely. We're working on a gay bundle as we speak, lining up an LGBT charity and sites. My goal is that we always have both a straight bundle *and* a gay bundle running at any given time. 
@_date: 2015-02-17 01:54:46
 &lt;--- I'm not having any problems viewing their site
