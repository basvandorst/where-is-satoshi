The first sentence could be taken to be a definition of a "true full node", so even if it's not a useful definition, lets assume this is correct. Let's also define "real full node" to be the same as a "true full node". Given this, it is incorrect to say that "the rest" "just" slow down block propagation.

Developers make UASFs possible, but they don't control the economy. If UASF codes are themselves dictatorial, there are many potential developer "dictators" each competing for control. And after the market decides which proposal is best, the wining "dictator" again has no control.
The expertise of developers is certainly relevant here but in aggregate, and weighted by the rational market participant by his perception of each developer's qualifications and reputation.
If a miner operator disagrees with the market decision, they're free to continue mining what will likely be a minority chain. There's nothing coercive about this. If you don't like that the incentive structure can be corrected to align with economic consensus, [tough titties]( Bitcoin wasn't invented to line the pockets of mining cabals.

They're not being sacrificed. It's not like they were guaranteed a network upgrade either SW or HF between the time they made their transaction and when they hoped it would be confirmed.
So there's an incentive to use the new technology when it becomes available. I don't think that's so bad. The fact of the matter is that many users will be ready to use segwit at launch, and will. Even if you don't, you'll benefit from others using it due to the lower network congestion.


It's not about holding them, it about people accepting payments to segwit addresses.


No I don't think that's why the HF crowd has support. There's often a backlog of transactions, but the oldest transactions in each of those are on the order of 3 days old. That's not really long enough that anyone would get worked up about a scaling proposal over it.

It's possible, but I much prefer the soft approach of gradually changing PoW, which would take some engineering. Having the forethought to minimize fallout in case of PoW make the threat morally sound as well as credible.
It's called the nuclear option for a reason: no one wants to have to resort to it, but the capability must exist in order for the threat to be understood by the adversary. For that reason users should run nodes in self-defense.
@_date: 2017-05-24 01:15:13
Most of those transactions will drop, and users will be able to re-spend their outputs with lower fees than would be necessary to have their transaction confirmed without segwit.
@_date: 2017-05-24 03:43:08


Yes. Or more accurately, they will drop from mempools, since every node can have a different retention policy for transactions.


A large part of transactions are made up up signature data. Segwit makes this data count less towards the resource constraint, called the block weight, than other data.
Currently we have the block constraint
    1=B+W,
where B is the base data (non-witness) size in megabytes, and W is the witness data size. With segwit activated, this constraint is replaced by
    4=4B+W
Solving for maximum base block size for a given ratio r=W/B shows that B is maximized in the segwit case. This means that the transaction capacity is larger under segwit. Since increased supply implies lower market price, we should expect to pay lower fees once segwit is activated, at least until demand catches up.

Everyone saw this. The scale up to 1 MB was made possible by optimizations, and so has the proposed SW scaling to 4 MB. I'm pro blocksize hard fork if and when further increases are found to be safe, and the evidence is made clear to everyone. We need everybody on board for a HF, after all.


You act like there aren't several [free options]( ready to go, and that [&gt;80%]( of nodes don't support segwit already. The capacity bump isn't 5x overnight, on chain, but I think that's good. No amount of testing is going to expose all potential difficulties encountered on the live network with a real economy. Small increments followed by observation and new solutions is going to be the best way forward, in my mind.


I don't like this idea of bundling together logically separate changes. It only sort of made sense to bundle the 4MB increase because it depends on the segwit structure. Enabling segwit in no way prevents a blocksize HF or vice versa, so the people lumping them together must be playing politics.

A non-mining node provides protection against invalid blocks. 51% attacks can be made with valid blocks, so just running a full node doesn't make you invulnerable. It does enable you (with the help of others) to immediately fork to a new POW where obtaining a majority hashrate isn't practical.

The idea is that the majority hashrate attacker mines a chain of blocks privately which is longer than the longest public chain, see ["rare extended chain"]( form the [bitcoin.org dev guide]( Note that the two "block2" etc. in the diagram don't have to contain the same transactions.
When the attacker reveals the longer chain to the network, it takes precedence over the short one. Thems are the rules.

Since it's the same PoW, there's perverse incentive for Bitcoin miners to mess with Segwit activation, and to capitalize on the speculative growth of BCC as Bitcoin dumps. Additionally, if a sizeable chunk of hashrate leaves for BCC, BTC capacity will suffer until the next re-target, while BCC will be fine, having 8x capacity.

If UASF doesn't manage 50% hashrate initially there is still a non-zero risk of re-org. This implies potential lost income for legacy chain miners due to evaporated block reward and the price tanking as users' transactions become unconfirmed.
This risk is averted if you're part of the majority hashrate mining UASF and mitigated if the amount you expect to lose in a re-org is less than what you expect to lose if the UASF chain is abandoned before you can take profit mining it (with each event weighted by it's respective probability).
The probability of the UASF chain being abandoned is low even in the case of ~13%-50% hashrate since the next difficulty on that chain will be lower than initially (and possibly the competing chain) by up to a factor of four, implying higher reward and a more attractive chain to mine. Add to this the potential to hurt the profits of your mining competition, and that fees will likely be higher on the (slower) UASF chain and the higher speculative value of the UASF coin ... I have trouble seeing this not work.
Don't expect miners to advertise support for BIP 148 in advance, though.
