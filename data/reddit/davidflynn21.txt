Honestly dont try time the market. In the long run, bitcoin will almost certainly go up. If we do have a dip it'll recover to above post dip prices eventually. Just invest what you can when you can. If you stand around waiting to time the market you'll miss out on oppeetunities.
Buy and hold don't worry about dips. Don't try time the market. That's how most people lose money.

There's currently a backlog of transactions waiting to be cleared. It'll go through eventually you'll just have to be patient

Honestly I think the price of bitcoin is propped up by a large amount of investors like this who really have no clue.

You need to sell it on a market place 


Checkout coinbase or local bitcoins.
It won't be free. You'll incurs fees.
