I guess in a perfect world with no other crypto, that argument would make sense. But right now people just go to other cryptos to make their transactions.

Wow really? show me proof the LN transactions are free. Since it requires minimum 2 on chain transactions to open/close the LN channel in order to make any tx at all.
Also LN transactions requires a LN node sitting in the middle to facilitate your transaction, that's not P2P.
@_date: 2018-01-01 17:02:53
Sure, for example, when you buy coffee from starbucks, each year starbucks open up a LN channel for whatever the on-chain fee, then you can make basically UNLIMITED tx during the year, then by the end of the year, starbucks close the LN channel for another on-chain fee. So it only cost starbucks two onchain transactions per customer, and made potentially thousands of nearly free LN transactions.

You don't have to pay yourself from the C-corp, with the tax reform, the c-corp now has a 20% tax rate, which is way better than your personal tax rate which can go up to 39.6%. Just keep all your unqualified investment income going to the c-corp, and pay the 20% tax rate. Use your C-corp to buy all the things you need, you can buy house, cars, anything, they might even be tax deductible since you can probably claim them as business expense. Just never take the profits out of the C-corp, there's no point to take money out since you own the company 100%. Actually even if you did take money out in the form of dividends, they are qualified if you had your company for over a year, so they are taxed at 15% long term capital gains rate. 20%+15% double tax is still better than your 39.5% personal rate, but really there's no point to take the money out at all.
Of course don't bother with all these unless you have something like 100k or more annual short term investment income.

I'm not going to sugarcoat it, Satoshi Nakamoto was a lousy programmer and wrote some messy code that took a lot of time to correct for other Bitcoin developers.

But he was able to mesh different ideas together and make it work.

The confirmation time is only an estimate, if your coins have a lot of inputs (eg aggregated from many tx), which looks like yours is, then miners want a very high fee, otherwise they will reject. You should have just sent a single transaction with a higher fee, (but still total amount of fee as 3 tx) which would make your tx attractive to the miners. 
Nothing you can do at this point, either wait and pray for confirmation at some point, or receive your money back after 14 days and try again. For such low amount of BTC, I'd suggest just keep it at a reputable exchange instead of transferring back and forth to your local wallet. The fees and frustration are not worth it. Bitcoin is really a speculation vehicle now, meant to be kept at exchanges. Transferring Bitcoin is a practice in frustration and fee rape.

The bigger question is why increase the block size, when we could just have more frequent blocks, like 3-5 blocks every minute.
* much better user experience, as 1st confirmation arrives within seconds usually.
* better decentralization, as small solo miners will find blocks much more frequently, low variance.
* less network bottleneck, as 1MB(or probably much smaller since blocks are now more frequent) blocks will travel the network easily, while 8MB blocks will bottleneck the network as everyone scramble to download 8MB of data at once.
The counter points about "more orphans" or "wasted hashrate" doesn't make any sense, since if all miners get more orphans or waste hashrates, then it ends up being still a fair system. Hashrate can't really be wasted anyway, since the hashes doesn't calculate any useful work to begin with. PoW mining is basically a competition to see who can waste more hashes by buying more miners.

For example, when people invested in ASICMINER at 0.1 BTC, did they know for sure this isn't a scam? NO, they took a leap of faith, and they were rewarded handsomely (the shares went to 3+ BTC later on). They might have invested 0.1 BTC in 9 other companies that failed, but this one success has made up for all that failed investments.

It's inevitable, banning Bitcoin is the ONLY choice for Chinese government, because Bitcoin usage will mean total defeat of Chinese capital control policies. 
If Chinese government want to keep their capital control in place (no more than $50k per person per year), then they can't allow Bitcoin to thrive in China. 
Same reason Thailand banned Bitcoin, and any country with strict capital control will eventually ban Bitcoin. They will not allow their capital control efforts to be eroded by Bitcoin. If they haven't banned it yet, it's because Bitcoin activity is still tiny in their country, and Bitcoin is not on their radar yet.

People don't usually use passwords they can't remember, otherwise you'll have to find a place to store your "100+ bits of entropy", with another password you could remember.
Also there's the always the possibility of sudden discoveries that makes the encryption become weaker, and your wallet will be the first to be cracked. This has happened to multiple encryption algorithms in the past. The heartbleed bug recently is a prime example. Your password at any website would have been revealed even if it was 100+ bits of entropy, because the https encryption was no longer secure.

Checkpointing is because of the PoW component of peercoin, precisely because PoW is so easy to 51% attack, especially against smaller alt coins. Many PoW coins failed because they couldn't fight against the rampant 51% attack.
As PoW begin to phase out of Peercoin, checkpointing will also phase out and no longer be needed.
Quote from: Sunny King
"The phaseout of ppc's checkpoint is planned for later this year but will be gradual. Eventually the checkpoint would become user enabled and by default not enforced. "
A pure Proof of Stake coin does not need checkpointing. PoW was implemented in Peercoin for distribution purpose only. A pure PoS coin like NxT does not have checkpointing, because 100% of the coins were distributed at block 0.

The easiest solution is implement "Proof of Stake' along side of the PoW mining (like Peercoin does), eventually phasing out PoW mining (it's unsustainable and easy to 51% attack just like what's happening right now). Except the Bitcoin devs are stubborn and don't want to hear about Proof of Stake.

Ever wonder why Bitcoin price keeps dropping while there's a ton of good news this year, and insane amount of adoption from big name vendors and regular people? well just look at how much money is waste in mining hardware and electricity bill, and you'll get your answer. Hundreds of millions of dollars, that could have been invested in Bitcoin eco-system, simply wasted away.
PoW is really at the end of the road, there's just no way the Bitcoin community can sustain hundreds of million dollars each year wasted on mining hardware and electricity bill. Instead, these money can be re-invested into the community and eco-system, like Bitshares does. If Bitcoin doesn't drop the PoW system soon, I can see Bitshares overtake Bitcoin in a matter of a few years.

well, the losses at RBS are partially due to their fraudulent practices:
John Morris spent £65 million ($104.9 million U.S.) converting a country house into luxury apartments; he had another £2.5 million in the bank to cover any last-minute problems, and already had buyers lined up for four apartments worth £7 million. But then, without warning, RBS drained the account with £2.5 million in it, stalling the development, and causing the buyers to walk away. Morris tried to buy the whole thing for £32 million, but RBS said no, instead selling it to its own property division, West Register, for £16 million.
Here's another: Eddie and Cheryl Warren bought the Bold hotel in Southport for £3.7 million ($5.7 million), with a loan from RBS. In the UK, mortgages are floating-rate, and the bank forced them to take out an interest-rate swap to protect them against rising rates. When rates fell, they had to pay penalties on the swap of £120,000 per year - but even so, they always remained current on all their payments. That notwithstanding, RBS declared that thanks to the rate swap, the Warrens were deeply underwater. The bank declared the hotel to be worth just £1.8 million, forced the Warrens into insolvency, and then ended up selling the hotel to - yes - West Register, for the bargain-basement price of £1.4 million. The Warrens lost everything, including their home; they are now divorcing.
And then there's Leonard Wilcox, who took out a £2.5 million ($4.4 million) loan to buy a property site valued at £5.35 million, only to see it being sold to West Register for £1.1 million in the end, losing his own home in the process.
The Sunday Times found lots of other stories like this, all of which included something called the Global Restructuring Group (GRG) at RBS. This group had the ability to take over loans and behave with breathtaking aggression and arrogance - and it took full advantage of all its powers.

Plus, even IF Ghash owned the hardware, they only had to spend 5% of Bitcoin marketcap to acquire these hardware and obtain 51%. Compared to 51% marketcap needed to attack a PoS network. Plus it doesn't make any sense for the 51% stake holder to attack, because he's basically attacking himself.
The problem with PoW is that the miner has no stake in the network, when a pool owns 51% of the PoW hash power, it's possible that the pool owner owns 0 BTC, and have no stake in the success of Bitcoin. Therefore he can easily be convinced to conduct an attack if given the incentive to do so.

30 BTC was just $100 when his exchange opened, he just never changed the fee because he doesn't believe in fiat exchange rate.

It's actually a very big problem. Miners don't really care about Bitcoin eco-system, miners care only about making a profit and ROI on their hardware.
Bigger block size means miners that use it will lose the race to miners that only use smaller block size (like when Discus fish pool started, they only used very tiny block size, and does not include many transactions, they changed this after much protest and DDoS threats).
I can already foresee many non-public miners to reject the bigger block size, and the public pools will be forced to match them.
The real easy solution, is actually reduce the god damn block time, have something like 30 seconds blocks would go a long way to help process more transactions, and also actually allows Bitcoin protocol to REDUCE block size, 0.2MB blocks would work just fine, and process way more transactions than today.

Actually, the cost of processing a transaction in Bitcoin is at least a hundred times higher than the cost of processing a transaction in regular banking system. Bitcoin process an extremely tiny amount of transactions compared to creditcard/banking system, but the cost is already very very high. It's currently subsidized by inflow of capital into the eco-system, but the question is for how long? This year's Bitcoin price action has already shown that the inflow of capital is having a hard time to keep up with the surging cost of mining. Even with massive amount of new adoption and good news coming in.
The problem is hardware manufacture and electricity companies are making hundreds of millions of dollars each year off Bitcoin mining, while the Bitcoin community is bleeding these huge amount of cash for NOTHING in return, and the Bitcoin price action this year is showing the full effect of the bleeding, no amount of good news or adoption can help it.
There's clearly a better way to secure the network, Bitshares has already demonstrated the DPoS system works. Money is re-invested into the eco-system and community, instead of paid to hardware vendor and electric company.

It's different, I don't know how to explain to you, but you'll see with time. 
PoW is really at the end of the road, there's just no way the Bitcoin community can sustain hundreds of million dollars each year wasted on mining hardware and electricity bill. Instead, these money can be re-invested into the community and eco-system, like Bitshares does. If Bitcoin doesn't drop the PoW system soon, I can see Bitshares overtake Bitcoin in a matter of a few years. 
Ever wonder why Bitcoin price keeps dropping while there's a ton of good news this year, and insane amount of adoption from big name vendors? well just look at how much money is waste in mining hardware and electricity bill, and you'll get your answer. Hundreds of millions of dollars, that could have been invested in Bitcoin eco-system, simply wasted away.

No, because the math says so. The current combined mining hardware cost about 10% of Bitcoin marketcap to obtain/purchase. Therefore, to perform a 51% attack, the attacker only need to spend 10% of the marketcap. 
But to perform a 51% attack against a PoS network, you need 51% of the marketcap. At this marketcap, why would you attack anyway? you are only destroying the largest stakeholder, yourself.

The key is to use common sense:
* I stopped using mtgox from June 2011 (after they lost their entire customer info db + passwords)
* I never buy "pre-order", or non-reputable bitcoin accepting sites.
* You should NOT keep money on any exchange, unless you wanted to immediately trade them. If you keep money on an exchange, that means you are aware of the risk, and willing to accept them, period.
* I agree, Bitcoin is definitely not suited for domestic retail transaction. It works best for international transactions. I can not think of any benefits of spending Bitcoin in domestic retail situation, other than privacy.
* BTC-E is more trustworthy than mtgox, if you bet your money on BTC-E being worse than mtgox, then you are wrong. BTC-E had no massive security breach, and never had any liquidity issue that would stop withdrawals. mtgox had multiple massive security breach, and was having liquidity issue for over 6 months.

What kind of bullshit paper is this? it cost nothing to acquire 50% of all PPC? dream on, why don't this author show me by "no cost" attacking any of the PoS coins out there? if Peercoin is too big for him, he could go for Novacoin, it has a tiny market cap.
Checkpointing is just insurance because Peercoin started with a hybrid of Proof of Work mining, which can be easily attacked by 51% by using an army of ASIC miners, any large Bitcoin pool could have performed the attack (and some of them did 51% attack other altcoins). The Dev had to sign blocks, precisely because Proof of Work is easy to attack.
@_date: 2014-03-17 14:08:27
Peercoin's encryption is not any "softer" than Bitcoin. Bitcoin mining is not "encrypting" anything.
Peercoin proof of stake mining is actually stronger than proof of work, because it's nearly impossible to 51% attack a proof of stake chain. It literally takes at least 51% of the marketcap, instead of the usual 10% to attack a proof of work chain. In practice, it takes much more than 51% to attack a proof of stake chain, because buying up 51% of the coins, will push the price to astronomical levels, enlarging the marketcap in the process. Also it wouldn't make sense for the attacker, since you are literally fucking yourself over, if you hold 51%, you are the most invested stakeholder of the chain.

Exchange's volume doesn't mean anything, a lot of them have no fee or extremely low fee, a big trader could make a 5000 BTC volume happen in a hour if he wanted. Doesn't mean he sold 5000 BTC, just his left hand trading with his right hand.

The problem is hardware manufacture and electricity companies are making hundreds of millions of dollars each year off Bitcoin mining, while the Bitcoin community is bleeding these huge amount of cash for NOTHING in return, and the Bitcoin price action this year is showing the full effect of the bleeding, no amount of good news or adoption can help it.
There's clearly a better way to secure the network, Bitshares has already demonstrated the DPoS system works. Money is re-invested into the eco-system and community, instead of paid to hardware vendor and electric company.

But what I meant to say was Bitshares is designed for VISA/Master level of transaction amounts per second, Bitcoin chain currently can NOT handle such amount of transaction per second, not even close.

There is already a solution, it's called Proof of Stake, it has already been implemented in many alt coins, successfully. Some are PoW+PoS hybrids, some are pure PoS.

Nearly all 3rd world country have capital control, because free flow often means disaster, like what we have witnessed in the 1998 southeast asia economic disaster (during the disaster, the SE asia countries all adopted emergency capital control).
This is why Europe had to create Euro, because even European countries would fear free flow unless they have a strong unified currency.
China have avoided disaster for 30 years, because of stringent capital control. They are not about to let it be eroded by Bitcoin. Thailand banned Bitcoin for the same reason. Most likely all countries with capital control, would eventually ban Bitcoin, they haven't done so because Bitcoin activity is still nearly non-existent in their country and is not on their radar yet.

It's all stemming from the flawed mining method "Proof of Work", with PoW miner holds all the power, but miners do not have Bitcoin's best interest at heart, only short term profits, and evidently they are even willing to mine empty blocks to push profits up.
I bet years from now, people will look back and be amazed that the actual users of Bitcoin had no voice in how Bitcoin should operate (possibly thru a Proof of Stake system), while a bunch of profit crazy miners had all the power.
IMHO, a hybrid system with both PoS and PoW should be the best route for any cryptocurrency. They fix each other's flaws, while distributing power more fairly, to both actual users and miners.

This is why a hybrid PoS + PoW is ideal. Pure PoW systems are super insecure and leads to centralization. The PoW profit driven miners have 100% of the power in such system, while the actual users (potentially the PoS miners), have 0% power and voting rights.

Then don't. Bitcoin's killer app was never retail transactions. It's holding wealth that can not be confiscated and can transfer across borders instantly, without 3rd party, and not subject to government scrutiny. Being able to buy things with Bitcoin is just a side benefit.  
Think about this: Do you go to a store and offer several grams of gold as payment and expect the transaction to go smoothly? it's amazing that Bitcoin can be used in a retail transaction at all since the original purpose of Bitcoin is to emulate properties of gold (mining, scarcity, fungibility, utility etc...).

Simple solution, check the "lock computer" when session end box in teamviewer, so your computer is always locked when you end your teamviewer session. Just make sure your computer is always locked (with a good password), then you can't get hacked since the hacker can't get past the windows locking screen.
As for browser passwords, use firefox and use a master password, then all your passwords are encrypted and you can't get hacked. Firefox will ask you for master password when you open the browser to sites. Do not use Chrome since chrome doesn't encrypt password and has no master password function.

Not necessarily monopoly, monopoly is actually often inefficient, because it has nothing to compare and compete with. But definitely several big companies are in control, in nearly every industry.

Agree, for all the bad rep Mircea Popescu gets (trolling, narcissist and an asshole in general), his websites are trustworthy, never been hacked and works.
Once the site changed owners, I stopped using bitbet immediately, since I don't know shit about the new owners, and have no reason to trust them.
Same thing with mtgox really, once they got hacked, I stopped using them, and avoided the really bad shit later. Basically I view Bitcoin sites as the ceremonial horse. As long as you don't ever mess up badly (eg. coinbase/bitstamp/btc-e), I will keep using it. If you mess up even once, I'm never using you again.

Yes, but I would consider it as a minor hack, also it wasn't really a weakness in their security, but a social engineering led into compromised server. Their security actually worked, they only lost what was in the hot wallet, this is pretty good considering their actual servers were compromised. Overall, bitstamp handled the situation very well.
The first mtgox hack was especially bad, because it actually crashed the Bitcoin price to less than $0.01, and was able to circumvent their security and withdraw coins. This was all done thru their website, without even hacking their server. Then mtgox had to rollback trades. That was when I lost faith in the mtgox management.

PoW is exactly the same, how much hash rate you own is tied to how much money you can spend. At least with PoS only stakeholders are mining, vs PoW anyone with money can be mining, but not necessarily being a stakeholder in the crypto, ie. government/big banks. It's easy for government/big banks to buy up mining equipment and control the PoW network. Very hard, nearly impossible to buy up 50% of currency in a crypto from open market, some people just won't sell.

I've been into Bitcoin for 1.5 years, and I was never scammed/hacked once. I think just use your head and think before acting, it'll prevent any scam. 
FYI right now the only services I use are:
* blockchain.info (for majority of coin storage with encrypted wallet backup offsite)
* mtgox.com (for small amount of coin storage for quick trading)
* bitmit.net and bitcointalk forum (for selling things)
* satoshidice.com (for occasional gambling)
On my PC I use "360.cn"'s free security software (it's a free AV and anti-trojan software, one of the best in the world, though currently only available in Chinese), I've used it for many years, never had any problems. Plus hardware/windows firewall. On blockchain.info and mtgox, I use two factor auth.
@_date: 2012-11-13 13:40:27
It's quite amusing that you don't know what you are talking about, yet you speak with blind confidence. Here's why SDice raised their edge:
May 10th: Eric speak of SDice loss
May 11th: Eric raise SDice edge to 1% due to loss
May 17th: Eric raise SDice edge to 1.5% due to loss
July 14th: Eric announce the edge will drop to 1.9% from 3% because losses were mitigated (I couldn't find where he announced the 3% increase, but apparently it was also due to continued loss).
So every single time the edge was changed, was due to loss, and yet you refused to acknowledge it. 
What you don't understand is that expected profit is the same, but martingale changes the distribution of profits/losses. Regular betting gives you the same profit/loss all the time, with house edge working normally. Martingale gives you small constant profits, and just ONE big loss. When you play large enough number of rounds, you will meet that big loss, but if you keep the number of rounds low, it's unlikely to meet it. It's like bitcoin address collision, there is a chance, but you will probably die first before you find a collision.

No human intervention is a flawed system.
The best system is a seller reputation system + non-reversible escrow. Basically it works like this:
1. the market place requires the seller to build up reputation before selling big ticket items
2. buyer does not get his escrow back under any circumstance except mutually agreed refund, so there's no reason for the buyer to screw the seller (especially since the seller knows your name and address). If there's a problem with seller, the buyer can decide to release partially or release to charity.
3. the seller has no reason to screw the buyer too, since if he don't ship or ship a rock, his reputation is ruined and he don't get any money. If he ships bad product, he doesn't get money or just get partial money.
Basically, any time one side decide to screw the other, is due to a financial motive. Once you remove the motive, there's no reason for one side to screw the other and there would be no need for additional protection.

That's incorrect, that's the marketcap, not how much it would cost for a single person to buy 70% of Bitcoin. Please learn some basic economics, why do you think when companies acquire another company, they often have to spend 30% or more than their target's marketcap, and this is under non-hostile circumstances. In hostile take over, they have to spend much more than that, just to get 50%, not even 70%.

our current financial system is on a blockchain with crypto address/wallets? It's nothing alike, not sure how you linked the two. 
Proof of Stake is just another way of mining and securing the network, by every stakeholder instead of profit-hungry rich PoW miners, it's MORE transparent than a few PoW mining farms in China. It's potentially way more decentralized (though depends on the distribution of the crypto itself). PoS drawbacks (theoretical, unseen in the real world), can be prevented by having a hybrid PoS+PoW system, which imho is the optimal mining method for a crypto.

Then SDice increased their edge to 1.9% and put a much lower cap on max bet (that's probably because so many people were using a similar martingale system, and SDice was hemorrhaging money), my system doesn't work as well with that, so I stopped playing.

But they refused, gave me some non-sense "our system doesn't support such things" excuse, and won't let me get my BCH back.
Basically your BCH and BTC addresses are interchangeable, if you own the private key, you can have the same address on both networks, so your coins are never lost even if you sent BCH to your BTC address (and vice versa), **if you own the private key**. Sadly coinbase owns my private key, and there's no way to get it if they refuse to help me. So congrats to all BCH owners, I just destroyed a bunch of BCH and increased your BCH value~~

Here's some internet tax advice. You can buy your Bitcoin back within 180 days if you don't like paying the taxes. "Like kind exchange" is not a taxable event. Though you still have to pay taxes later on when you eventually sell the Bitcoin, maybe under a more favorable tax rate/law later.

It's really just a hidden tax, the city governments figured out they don't make much money if they don't limit the number of licenses. Free competition between vendors, will drive hotdog prices down to like $0.50 costco hotdog prices. In most countries street food is cheap like this, because fierce free competition between vendors. But in NYC, you pay your $3 for a hotdog, because probably $2.50 of that goes to the city as license fee.
Taxi license used to be six figures too in nyc, but uber (eg free competition) destroyed that monopoly, so nyc banned Uber for several years, until the NY governor stepped in to legalize Uber for the entire state including NYC earlier this year. Not sure how nyc will deal with Uber now.

If you have something absorbing it, it doesn't have to go through the roof. Like when AIG had a 100B hole to fill, and government prints 100B to fill it, there's no immediately inflation, only a filled hole. Though of course eventually this 100B will come out to play in the general economy, because AIG shareholders will eventually cash out their shares (or will they?), it's a long and slow process, this is why there's always inflation in the long term (eg we used to buy houses for $30k in the 70s, now the same house cost $300k).

Because he specifically did a thing that BCI wallet tried to get people not to do, eg. generating a private key online AND then try to copy paste it into BCI wallet. This is a legacy method and strongly discouraged by BCI. BCI doesn't even provide a private key export any more due to the risks involved with copy pasting private key online. BCI would provide your encrypted wallet, and you can access your private key offline in electrum or something.
But people will jump to conclusion and call BCI "insecure" for offering more ways for user to fuck up. If BCI didn't offer private key import function, then this wouldn't happen. People will call coinbase more secure because it doesn't even allow you to access your private keys at all, therefore no chance for user to fuck up.

Bullshit, if it were that easy, then in the US there currently would be funds that offer guaranteed 5% return while also guarantee your principle will not lose value. They can then pocket the profit when they make anything more than 5% a year, like you said 5%-10% easily right?
The fact that there isn't any fund in the US that currently does this, means what you said isn't true, there are significant risks involved to achieve more than 5% returns currently in the US. Not everyone's situation allow them to take on this risk.
We are in a very long bull market currently, 90% of the investors probably think they have it all figured out, they have a "strategy" that worked well for them for the past 10 years or so, 5%-10% a year easy.

BCH having small block content or faster block time has nothing to do with large block size, and has everything to do with it being a hardfork competing with the main chain. The large block size part is working out very well for them, and the sky hasn't fallen.

Other currencies print way more, and China is in a realestate bubble that is probably beginning to burst. A small 1 bedroom apartment in Beijing is costing around $1 million, while the regular folks in Beijing make $1500/month barely. Similar things are going on in all major Chinese cities.
Also the Yuan devalues way more rapidly, the same apartment that sells for 25k yuan back in 2000, now sell for 6M yuan. It's part of the reason why Chinese real estate is in a bubble, because it's the only place safe from rapid inflation of the Yuan.

Why should they give you fees back? you choose to sell your bitcoin at coinbase, and not gdax. 
Coinbase does give you reports, but they aren't a bank, so they can't provide a bank statement to you. It's mostly your own lack of planning and unaware of your bank's requirement on fund history. If you had withdrawn your funds from coinbase 3 months prior to your mortgage application, there wouldn't be any need for a "coinbase statement".

Vast majority of the fraud in ACH is not vendor fraud, but client fraud, like the one happened to tradehill, a guy ACHed money to dwolla, then to tradehill, then bought BTC and transfered the BTC out to himself, then went to his bank and claimed the ACH was un-authorized and took the money back from dwolla, then dwolla charged back from tradehill.

They can't, current Bitcoin tech can not support much more transaction, even with segwit. So a 2nd layer network would be pretty much required (and segwit makes that possible), and miners can't make money from 2nd layer network.

The company's founders also sold hundreds of millions of XRP, this number is not public, but estimated from their announcements/leaks throughout the years. So I estimate another 1% float was sold by company founders thru the exchanges.

It's not a "perk", but a necessity. The fork is kinda like a dividend or stock split, and you can only access the funds if you hold the private key, and coinbase holds the private key. I don't see any reason for coinbase to deny access to the funds if it has an apparent non-zero value.

Better or not is subjective, having value by being exchanged on a reputable exchange is an observed fact. If a fork has value, then it should be able to withdraw from coinbase, because coinbase doesn't allow customers to hold private key, therefore coinbase is responsible to allow the customers to withdraw the forks that has any value, otherwise the customer have no way of knowing if Coinbase is secretly selling the forks for their own gain.

Not paying out physical gold doesn't necessarily mean it's fractional reserve, it's just not feasible to accommodate every redemptions in physical gold (GLD will only deliver physical gold for $16M+ redemptions). So they choose to pay in cash instead, you still get the full value of your gold, you can just immediately take your cash and buy same amount of gold yourself. 
Apparently most investors doesn't think it's a big problem, otherwise physical gold delivery ETF like OUNZ would be very popular. But it's not. ETF is a product, offering what your customer want, and skip the things they don't want, is key to success. So apparently gold ETF investors don't really care about physical delivery.

Because the network have something called "consensus", basically it's an agreement of who owns what on the blockchain. All miners and nodes must agree to this "consensus" in order to mine or to be on the right chain. Therefore if someone says he now owns your Bitcoin, but is unable to produce your private key to sign the transaction. Then the network rejects his claim because the consensus demands that you must own the private key to those Bitcoins in order to create transactions.
Is it possible to fake Bitcoin? sure if the consensus agrees, ie. majority of nodes and miners agree to create "fake Bitcoin", then it can be created because that's what the consensus allows. In reality it won't happen since it's against their self interest.

Segwit does not provide inherent nor immediate scaling, there are other factors involved. It maybe "smarter", but its scaling promise is still has a long way to go, lightning network isn't even ready as shown by Litecoin's segwit activation. 
Blocksize increase is a 1 line code change that provide immediate scaling, should've been done years ago. Litecoin's segwit activation also came with a promise to increase block size when litecoin blocks are 50% full, that's how Litecoin got miner's to agree to segwit activation.

What? a block size increase let's say to 8MB, 
* immediately scales Bitcoin for many years, vs segwit has no immediate scaling for Bitcoin, which means we end up with all the same problems after segwit
* is 1 line of code change, vs segwit several thousands of lines of code change
* is compliant with Satoshi's original vision, vs segwit potentially destroying decentralization and Satoshi certainly did not envision something like segwit/sidechain at all.

Just look at what's happening at ETH? a hardfork without 95%+ agreement, will cause chaos and split in the community. Also changing the size is easy, but it's just a patch, not a solution. What happens when the new limit is reached? hardfork again? This type of hardfork is very dangerous and damaging, just look at ETH.
Actually I'm not convinced there is an on-chain solution, nor there is a need for a solution. Satoshi set the limit at 1MB for a reason, maybe Bitcoin is meant to forever be at 1MB block size. There are ways to transact without being on-chain, just look at what Storj and Counterparty is doing, ALL countryparty transactions uses the Bitcoin blockchain, you receive the transaction at your Bitcoin address, and yet non of the data is stored on Bitcoin's blockchain. I believe this is the future path for Bitcoin.

botnet has never been successfully used to mine Bitcoin, and also Litecoin.

Currently the PoW miners have a lot of power, as shown in blocking segwit. The whole agenda of Core is to strip power away from miner, this can only be done with 1mb blocks + segwit. Miners can retain their power for at least another 4-5 years, with something like 8mb blocks. This is why Core want only segwit, and miners want only big blocks. The compromise is of course activate both. Miners are on board with the compromise (I think some of them agreed to even 2MB blocks now), Core is not.

The miner can not alter the logic, it's part of the protocol, if the miner alter the logic, then the miner can no longer mine in the accepted chain. If the miner can alter the logic, then the bitcoin client would have no need for a "standard fee", since people can just do whatever they want. Also people would not be asking the Bitcoin devs to change the fee, instead they would be asking miners (which would also be pointless, since you are saying miners can decide the standard fee on their own).

PoW is inherently centralization and dangerous, because the miner has no stake in the system, and will quickly sell their hash power to the highest bidder (ie banks, government) at the earliest opportunity, or use it to attack if it's profitable.

That's a false argument. Ok credit card company is 2%, but usually they give back 1% to customers in cashback programs plus other benefits (car rental insurance, international travel health insurance, road side assistance etc...). So essentially the cc company take less than 1% for themselves.
Bitcoin transaction is not free. If overstock choose a 3rd party processor like bitpay/coinbase, expect to pay minimum 1%, plus the exchange risk (bitcoin can go up/down 30% in a few seconds). Plus, the customer also pay a "network fee" when sending the transaction, and it can be hefty if the customer has a lot of "dust" coins.

I don't know about you, but 2.5min vs 10min, it's pretty easy to see who is faster, and especially when some sites require 3 or 6 confirmations, Litecoin confirmation time becomes exponentially better. Plus Litecoin does not suffer from the "block size" problem that is currently a hot topic in Bitcoin, because Litecoin by design has 4X larger block size.
I'm not talking about buying mining hardware, I'm talking about using the GPU I already have. Yes I'm a single GPU miner, whom has just been pushed out of Bitcoin mining by ASICs. I thought Bitcoin was about empowering the people, even peasants like me, but now Bitcoin mining will be monopolized by a few rich miners that can afford huge/risky investment into specialized ASIC hardware. Litecoin on the other hand, is designed to make ASIC not viable, so little peasants like me, can still mine with my single GPU. 
I think it's debatable whether ASIC makes the network more secure, do you think it's easier for national government/banks to purchase tens of thousands of ASIC units, or purchase tens of thousands AMD GPU? both are doable, but I think the GPU route is much much more difficult because they would compete against regular gamer demand, which we already seen previously, AMD GPU that were good for mining were completely sold out everywhere.
Overall, I think the current traits of Bitcoin makes it a good "reserve" currency, but not a great "transactional" currency. The daily transaction can be done in Litecoin which can handle much more transaction volume at a much faster confirmation rate. This is exactly how ancient people used gold and silver, gold was reserve, rarely used in daily transaction, while silver were widely used in daily transaction. This is why Litecoin exists, and why Litecoin seeks to be the silver of Bitcoin(gold).

Except Bitcoin fee is much higher than credit card.
With credit card, the merchant is charged something like 1.9% for card present transactions. Customer is charged nothing, in fact often the customer get 1% or more cash back, all my credit cards are 1% or more cashback cards.
With Bitcoin, you pay a network fee when you send the transaction, which can be as high as $0.25 when Bitcoin value goes up fast and the client is stuck with a old fee.
Then when the merchant usually have to use a service like bitpay/coinbase to accept your transaction, which cost them another 1% in fees.

The way the site is set up, it's unlikely he could run away with coins.

These types of code execution vulnerabilities are a non-event, oh it lets the attacker execute any program on the server, yes that's bad, but not RoR bad, the hacker has to get some malicious program on the server first, and any competent sys admin would make it extremely difficult for the hacker to do that. The RoR zero day let's the hacker obtain actual data from the database, even if the webapp code has perfect security, it didn't matter, it was a rails vulnerability, that's real bad.
There's no unhackable server, but there are differences in difficulty. Some server would take years to hack, and by then they would have changed their security anyway. Otherwise if it were that easy, then all the banks/governments/financial sites are fucked, but in reality they are not.

The article did not explain why it's not wasteful. The fact is millions of KW are being wasted to do something that can be done by PoS using nearly zero KW.
PoW is not scalable because as Bitcoin value grows, the mining network MUST also grow, otherwise it can't keep up with the security requirement, the growth is linear. With $1B market cap, we are already mining with how much hardware? using how much electricity? Can you imagine the immense waste of hardware and electricity when Bitcoin is at $1T market cap? just multiply the current mining situation by 1000X, this is not sustainable.

Those code may not be that valuable if they let github host it. Plus even if it were valuable, it's difficult to assess the value or find a buyer for them, I don't think many companies have a department for buying illegally obtained code. Yes you can probably find some valuable information from github and square database, but they are very difficult to convert to actual money. On the other hand, BTC and identity information can be pretty mush sold easily without effort.
I guess coinbase could have been a target, but they have a pretty good cold storage policy which makes them less attractive.

It'll be deflationary in the far far future, like 20 years from now. Before then, it'll be a hugely inflationary (though the rate will be slowly decreasing). 3600 new BTC minted per day is a huge inflation rate, that translates to 1.3M BTC minted per year, which is roughly a 12% annual inflation rate, compared to real world USD inflation rate of below 3% annually.
Not only that, there is now inflation by alt coin. LTC alone has taken $100M worth of marketcap away from BTC. Not to mention all the other alt coins, PPC, BTB etc... You can see ALL alt coins are booming while BTC is languishing, LTC was worth $0.06 4 months ago, now it's $2.5, similar case seen in all alt coins. All these new money came from BTC.

well, 4X faster confirmation, better crypto algorithm (ASIC not viable) for starters. Litecoin does not seek to replace Bitcoin, it seeks to be the silver while Bitcoin is the gold. The faster confirmation time is really a great feature that will allow Litecoin to be used/traded more easily than Bitcoin. I have always hated the long wait for confirmation that some Bitcoin sites require (which are completely necessary to avoid double spend attack). Litecoin's scrypt mining algorithm will allow peasants like me to still use my GPU to mine, instead of requiring huge risky investment into specialized ASIC harware.

It's a old habit from the dial-up days. For example one of the most popular and oldest portal site is called 163.com, which is because they used to offer dial up internet service, and the number to dial is 163. 
Similarly, there is 263.net for the same reason as mentioned above.
Then the habit got started from there. The number can also represent phonetic meaning, for example 56.com vaguely sounds like "I'm happy" in Chinese. Much like in the US, people use 2(to) and 4(for) in domain names.
