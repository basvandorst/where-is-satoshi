Billions has been spend for cancer research. And the death numbers of cancer is still rising higher and higher.
Fighting the symptoms doesnt help much if you don't change your diet which causes cancer.

Had the same problem last year and now. Told my parents about bitcoin last year in october 2013 that i wanted to invest in bitcoin. They behaved like your parents and denied my decision.
Despite their suspicion towards the investment, i started to set up everything in order to be able to purchase bitcoins. But because the price has risen like crazy and i hesitated a lot i managed to buy btc only at a pretty "high" price. Nevertheless i am  glad that i did it. I felt certain and went all in. 
Make your own decisions.
