I will check them out, thanks!

I identify with that 100%, which is why I am asking for guidance and help.

yeah I have been reading that, which is one of the major reasons I posted these questions here. I appreciate all the help and direction that I have been getting.

Strong Bad Saves the DAY!  
The Cheat told me so..

heh, well I am a miner for the most part. But that does make a lot of sense.

If minig in a pool, you are looking at a rough estimate as follows:
0.05 per day
0.347 per week
1.507 per month
This is assuming 24/7 mining with no hiccups in power or computer issues.
Edited because I added 1 extra zero in the figures for the hash rate.. oops. :)

Regardless of rates, high as they may be, upvote for exposure. I know that a lot of people I talk bitcoins to, their first question is "Can I pay my phone bill with it?"
Now, I can say "Yes"
That in itself is a big improvement.

Heh,  no worries.  I am in the same boat with a 60Gh rig from BFL,  I figure just let it keep chugging along because if one does not mine, no transacted verified. So I feel happy that I can contribute in a small way.

I saw that about Bitspend, I will have to take a closer look at it. I am hoping with all the start-up markets that are being created for Bitcoin that someone can figure out how to make this happen. Paying my Verizon, Electric and Gas bill with Bitcoins would totally rock my world.

Well I guess this answers my question I posted the other day. It now exists and now let the competition begin.
