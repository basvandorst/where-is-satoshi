Damn, yea seems the mining for Bitcoin is not so lucrative unless you invest big to compete with the big guys.....And even then costs to replace parts in the future with increasing difficulty..... I think most people were just looking for easy money and thought hey, i'll buy a machine and let it make me money.........doesn't work like that they will find.....research and some knowledge is needed.

Mixed signals? It hasn't gone below the 5.8k mark yet? Bullish!

Yes, if we get an opportunity to spend coins and actually use the system then that at the end of the day, THAT is the best way to make it grow. By adoption. My point is not to keep onto your coins and never use them. My point is if you get into this game, if you put money you can't afford to lose into it, there is likely an emotional attachment there and there are especially a lot of newer investors coming in without even knowing what Bitcoin is or why they are investing into it. Without having these two things, how is one supposed to not panic when it plunges over 50 percent when they have no clue why and all you can see is the media headlines 'its a bubble' etc etc etc. But, if one arms themselves with knowledge and therefore a belief in the system, then it is much easier to ride those out. I even bought some some meals at my local cafe in Bitcoin when Bitcoin was supposedly going down with no avail at 7k USD. My point is mainly that people should look into things a bit more before they decide to mortgage their house on it and the media is not helping at all with their false information.

Yes, by 'Being prepared to hodl till zero' in my article I just mean that you should expect big dips but as long as you believe in the product in which you are investing and have researched it thoroughly then why lose that faith and give in to the people that try to spread false information? I feel like a lot of media outlets need to be held more accountable for their actions when spreading false information.

The problem is they keep closing my ticket. Already open'd and reopened 3 times. Now the 4th. Hoping they don't close it again. Their behaviour with the way they are handling this is what worries me. They make it feel like i'm talking to a small child who is refusing to give me back something they want to keep. Very frustrating!

This looks pretty cool. Never heard of something like this. Great idea :)

Then maybe you seem to be the exception to the rule. I've had nothing but issues with them. Binance I'm fine with and others too. Only had trouble with Poloniex. All other exchanges I've never had an issue. Also if you scroll around, there are a HUGE amount of people with this 'withdrawal:error' problem.
