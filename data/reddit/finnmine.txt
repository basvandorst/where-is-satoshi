This. So much. I can't understand why everyone here thinks that LN will magically solve the scaling problem.
In addition to what you said, LN by design will create centralization. There's no monetary incentive to open multiple small channels to different people / hubs. Quite the opposite, the high fees will incentive people to open large and as few channels as possible.
LN might help a little bit when it comes to regularly sending funds to payment services or exchanges, but what about in the other direction?
Maybe I haven't understood this correctly, but why would anyone open thousands of channels (and tie their BTC into those channels) so that they can pay individual people?

But it is a problem. What are you supposed to do when you've opened a payment channel to a payment hub and they become unavailable? Close the channel to free your funds and open a new one to another hub?
Remember that the funds are locked in that channel. You can't use them in another one until the first channel has been closed.
Like I said earlier, the transaction fees will make people create as few channels as they possibly can.

Not here in Finland, at least for now. You can buy and cash out without any form of ID.

Limited amount of?
Amount of cash that you can withdraw? Idk, it's above 10k€ when the ATM is full. And yes, it requires a phone number on larger amounts, but you can get a prepaid number without an ID.
Edit: Pretty sure the phone number requirement is just there to provide a way to wait for a confirmation.
