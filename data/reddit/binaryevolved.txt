Excuse me for being a bit late to the whole thing, but what exactly is a correction?

It makes sense really; a company is giving away BTC in the value of $10 for being a student (or at least having access to a student email.) I imagine a ton of students likely signed up and lost interest rather fast and never spend the $10.
The entire point of the promotion was to get a young user base into Coinbase to build loyalty.
If you just sign up and stop caring, they will take the money back because it is only wasting there; if you use it, then it is fair game.
Sucks that they offered it and took it back, but likely was stated in the terms of service.

Got lucky, Hopefully they don't randomly go "Oh by the way we locked your price in!"

Any investing is like gambling, but a lot slower than normal gambling.

If you have debt, you shouldn't gamble.
I work at a gas station that is a Michigan Lottery dealer. The town is rather small and typically holds families that make sub $30k a year. It is 10 miles away from a larger city that holds those who make more money.
So often I see people come in and say the phrase "I can't really afford it, but get me a ticket number  and this $30 dollar ticket for tonight's drawing" They can often owe money to child support or have their house in a state of disrepair. Yet they will spend a couple hundred a month on the lottery in an attempt to get to a better place. The sad thing is, most of them don't realize that in Michigan we have a policy where all your debts will be paid off before you see a penny of any large ($1000+) winnings. So they could strike it big and still keep coming back to see if they can win again to actually profit.

But instant, verified, and backed transactions have not. The internet brought with it credit cards and debit cards (as we now know them.) Allowing for "*instant*" settlement of payments. 
Before the internet when [credit/debit?] cards were first a thing, they were simply a pressed piece of plastic that the stores would call in at the end of the day to the bank and hope the account was real, and their transaction would be backed.
Checks also are not instant, but have been around longer than the internet. Also required faith that the check was valid, and a bank would back it.
(Relativily) guaranteed payments, backed by a paper trail, multiple large entities, and instant (to the end users) payments are something more recent.

Couldn't the argument be made that someone with a battery could still accept and send bitcoin, where as you require power all the way to the bank's data center to deal with the payment?
While there are still issues (like being able to process transaction without a POS, or having a data connection), bitcoin still reduces a couple links in the chain required to conduct a fiscal transaction.

USB Battery banks are cheap,
If this is a regular problem, keep multiple battery banks (or one car battery with a convertor)
Go to store with charged phone to sign the transaction and present the signed transaction to the person with internet. Person with internet receives the transaction (Several QR, Bluetooth, etc.) and broadcasts it using their backup connection. Download the proof of transaction and present to the store owner to then be manually verified.
Transaction complete.

IIRC, sending a payment is signing a message saying "I have this key and would like to send this amount to this person." 
The signed message is the validation required to make the payment right? So what prevents someone from making a system where a customer creates the signed message and provides it to a seller who then can broadcast it on their behalf? This is how offline signing works right? So technically, if you are meeting in person (like you would in a store transaction), only one person requires an internet connection to broadcast the transaction, and then download proof of the transaction broadcast?

So what you’re saying is.. HODL..
Then again I feel like everyone says “yeah right, that’s not when it increases- it will increase by X instead”
