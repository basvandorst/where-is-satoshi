Do you mind sharing why you don't believe in the long term value of ETH? Great post btw
@_date: 2017-11-30 04:59:54
It definitely is but there will be a thousand more

I didn't read any of your comment because it's too long but I assume you are asking for advice. BUY BUY BUY

I would take out at least half and put it into safer investment because you could lose everything. I honestly think bitcoin is a bubble. People are buying to get rich and not because they believe in the technology.

How can you be so wrong? Take 1 minute to google before you comment shit like this
@_date: 2017-11-30 01:46:14
Just trying to catch the rises. That's why it's a massive bubble. I'm still buying and I'll sell before it pops

People talk about losing bitcoin keys or whatever by wiping the hard disks. What happens to those bitcoins?
@_date: 2017-11-30 02:38:13
I'm only putting what I'm prepared to lose. ETH looks promising though so that's where I want to put my money

what are the fees with gdax?
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:43:47
Buy fast. It's going back up

You will kick yourself in a month from now
