A full node is a miner, as stated in the white paper. Non-mining nodes do not validate, and we should absolutely not block the network just so small users who contribute nothing can run nodes.

Yes.

This, we shouldn't have people seeing dissenting opinions. We have to  this coin till we are gillionaires

I'm not offended at all. I love replies like yours, shows how wrong you all are. If your only response is to call someone a shill, you have no argument and are therefore - weak minded.
@_date: 2018-05-05 11:43:39
You are weak minded. Your baseless character attack that I'm a sock puppet does not refute what I am saying. 
@_date: 2018-05-06 16:49:46
Just like this entire sub against real Bitcoin.

I'm the one who has to document my claims? What about OP? Literally every piece of "evidence" is either irrelevant or posts from random twitter accounts.
@_date: 2018-05-05 10:57:50
This makes no sense OP. If what he is saying is so wrong, you should want it to stay up and share it so everyone else knows. What are you trying to achieve here?
@_date: 2018-05-05 13:33:31
No, you made no point with your satire other than to be an insulting moron. Weak minded.

The first cut of your post is just lies from twitter personalities and redditors. Downvotes are not the fault of and for all we know Adam Back and his full team of trolls could be the ones doing it as a false flag. They even changed the CS so downvoted comments aren't hidden.
The second half is all falsehoods as well. Everything he said about Mt. Gox was true. He never said he was banned from this echo chamber.  
Rent free.

Thanks for letting me know about Roger's new tweet OP.

I'll admit you're right on gold's volatility, but it's far more stable than fiat in my opinion. Fiat essentially always depreciates, and arguably it can be even more volatile depending on how Keynesian the people behind it are.


It makes no difference whether it's three, ten or a million pools. The second the miners in a pool stop getting paid is when they stop sharing their hashpower. That's why 51% attacks from large nodes with hundreds or thousands of "miners" (really just hash calculators) are completely null; they take effect for a few hours at most before the majority of miners just give up trying to get paid. 
If a government tried this, they'd only manage to dump the price a modest amount from the few transactions they could pull of in that time. They can not change the protocol or create new coins in any way. It is economically infeasible that anyone would try it, unless a serious flaw in the hash algorithm is found and exploited.


The miners choose to mine whatever is the most profitable, which is what they should be doing. Those issues are because of c**ns***hip and therefore users believing in inferior tech. There is no reason to blame the miners here, especially considering that most of them have to constantly re-invest what they earn in more hardware to increase profits.


With it Bitcoin would not be useful in the first place. Obviously not everyone who likes Bitcoin is a criminal or a fraud, there is just a lot of utility in not having to risk your funds being seized or having your payments reversed when some authority decides. 
And even if payment reversals are useful - they can still be done with Bitcoin with Blockchain audits and voluntary agreements from merchants. All it would take is a trusted third-party as with fiat, but very few people are in Bitcoin for that reason at the moment.


If that is the case there will be a market for it eventually, but that's not the case. Censorship resistance and knowing full well that transactions are final is much more efficient than depending on an authority. 
And these chargebacks and payment reversals are unreliable without giving away much of your private information, another area in which Bitcoin soars.


Non-mining nodes do not validate transactions, this was essentially just an attempt to convince users into a separate fork with transactions incompatible with previous versions. This was in no way a sybil attack on Bitcoin.

The volatility is not due to the issuance cap, it's to do with it being apart of the few unregulated markets in the world and it's low adoption. Gold has a far more strict issuance rate yet is one of the most stable assets.
Mining centralization is not a problem, all large pools are open source and there's no chance individual miners will take part in ruining their own investment.
On the opposite end as a merchant, irreversibility of transactions is a life-saver against theft. No needing to risk dealing with slow bank/credit card companies when someone tries to defraud you.
I do not understand what part of Bitcoin you're referring to can be sybil attacks? 
Many people find those things to be benefits (except ransomware and money laundering hoepfully), especially drug "traffic".
But you have a point, it was fairly good but like every system there was a way to attack it especially when it was relatively new.

It i- was essentially impossible to double spend Bitcoin C- when it was 2011. It i- was so useful, getting instant transactions. Satoshi's method *did* work.

//seeing as I received upvotes, I'd like to point out that I was referring to this subs obsession with a single person while banning any discussion of his preferred way to scale Bitcoin. Downvote away.
