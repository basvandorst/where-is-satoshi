@_date: 2017-12-06 21:03:59
it does not have i just wanted to tell that i dont think of btc as a bube
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:04:55
ik but if the dollar crashes the euro will crash aswell

yeah and i guess there would be maintenance problems cuz u cant get up there everytime to repair or switsch parts

i didnt have the time to read all the comments
but from my point of view its nice if u invest now and price drops then u can buy even more btc
(saying this as an 18yo, so maybe not if ur older and need safe conditions)
i will go full range with btc and sharp drops will only make me buy more :)

im like 99% sure that they already have a btc strategy i mean they are one of the biggest banks in the world they definitly work on it

i feel like nobody of my relatives or friends is into btc so i would just rent a locker in a bank (not sure what the english word is sorry) and place a detailed description on how to use and work with btc in addition i would show them the easiest way to sell so they can get some bonus money

so you're basically saying that i have something like a cold wallet at ur service and if i die u would take care of my relatives and introducing them in a personal way 
but im asking myself how do u know when i died and how do my relatives get to know that i had btc at ur coldwallet

in my situation this would  not make sense
if u want to make any profit with an antminer s9 u need to have like zero electricity costs to ensure a resonable roi
i understand that u want to support the network but of ur out for the money better buy genesis mining contracts they have a roi of 160 days (ik that the difficulty changes but maybe the price also does so it would be even) 
@_date: 2017-11-30 23:14:26
at genesis mining u can buy hashrate for a lifetime it is only limited by a daily fee so they can run their large mining farm in iceland if the contracts are not profitable anymore they just run out
just google genesis mining and check out if this interests u
!!!!! very import !!!!!!
check when the next block halvening is happening i think its not very far from now when this happens u only get half of the bitcoins per block which will half your profit and double ur time for roi
ull have to check it out maybe ull get the roi before that but dont make much profit after that anymore

i agree with that one would still need to try millions or billions of combinations of 12 words with 26 different letters

different cryptos are working on quantum resistency im not sure if it is on btcs roadmap 
i guess its like if u happen to find out how the sha algorithm works and mine hundreds of bitcoins the difficulty will adjust and it would not work anymore o guess
