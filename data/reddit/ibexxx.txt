We don't all agree in here... I'm bullish on bitcoin for sure but this idea that we are on the brink of true crypto anarchy and that governments will face a legitimate challenge based on the popularity of bitcoin is unrealistic.

This is hilarious. Yep, certainly any day now we will all stop using fiat

This alt right shit coming into bitcoin is stupid. This comment is extra stupid.

Nope. They confirmed that the wire needs to be reversed on their end. They just won't do it.

Maybe I'm being a bit naive about this community but why are we making this into r/the_donald? IMO these non-sense anarchy/libertarian posts do not help the cause of bitcoin among the general public and further make the community look like tinfoil hat dumbasses that we are accused of being. If you want to criticize government monetary policy there are tons of examples ([India's Monetary failing]( [Brexit Pound Crash]( These are real, Ron Paul quotes are just weird politically driven propaganda pieces for the most part.

They sent one response that saud they need my wiring instructions to send it back. Then the crickets... They definitely have it it's just executing the reversal
