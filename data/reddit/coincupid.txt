I hear people's blockchain.info addresses are being hacked. If I provide my bitcoin address to CoinLearn.org, wont I risk my existing coins ? Sorry for being noob... but this bitcoin thing is very confusing.

How come ?

 is not a classic faucet, but  is. Lately they are getting very popular on BitcoinTalk.

What is your problem with mBTC ?
@_date: 2015-05-22 10:52:27
The problem with real time exchanges is you need to keep your FIAT deposited before. So, you are always locked with them. There is no such problem for direct trading exchanges.

neither they asked for my password nor any API key (though i dont have any ... ha ha) !!! but they asked for my bitcoin address. should not i provide it to them ?
@_date: 2015-05-22 10:36:30
Real time exchanges have certain advantages. That is why people use them. But, it is true, for large trade, direct trading exchanges are preferable.

SegWit is bullshit. See the kind of confusion it is creating...

What about WageCan?

AFAIK, Chinese miners, even Jeff himself is more inclined to [BIP 106 Proposal 2]( But, classic players are trying to trick people with 2mb and force feed BIP 101. I guessed this might not go well Chinese miners once they understand exactly what is happening... and it seems, my guess was correct.

In the grand scheme of things BRICS will probably take a bigger role in the success of bitcoin than any other nation.
@_date: 2016-06-12 10:37:23
Do u mean bitcoin will fall from here?
@_date: 2016-06-12 10:57:41
I wish people remembered this when the price went down to 170 in Jan 2015.
@_date: 2016-06-12 10:38:51


So, some bull might have been pretty healthy.
@_date: 2016-06-12 10:30:38
What sparked this sudden jump? The chart looks pretty sharp.
@_date: 2015-07-04 16:10:23
True... this might happen to anyone in current financial system.

Litecoin &amp; Dogecoin also works today. Many games also accept them today. That has NOT made them anywhere close to Bitcoin. The 14 month old article was referred to point out the obvious fact that, unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum does NOT offer any unique value proposition. What it offers is actually possible on Bitcoin's blockchain itself.


I think your love for Ethereum has blinded you. While genesis sell offered 2000 ether per BTC, Mircea Popescu offered 5000 ether per BTC up to 1000 BTC. But, his lower offer was not consumed, while the higher offer was taken up. It only shows the sell was a got up and the price is centrally controlled.

But, the question remains that who booked bitcoin.com first? Because, it was booked on January 04, 2008, i.e. before bitcoin.org.

Double posting. Check -

I read the comment. The spammer has used all sorta buzzwords and conspiracy theories to glorify Ethereum. If someone gets sold to those, it is fine. But, for those with slightest bit of rationality, I'd present two analysis that proves the empty promise of Ethereum... one from technical perspective and another from economical.
**Technical**: [Using CounterParty, the whole Ethereum can be written on bitcoin blockchain, which is far more secure than any other blockchain](
**Economical**: [Ethereum was distributed by a central authority with a fixed value and they claim to sell even when a lower offer by Mircea Popescu did not go through](

How are they better than WageCan ?

Anonymousspeech is not anonymous. The person using it is anonymous. So, bitcoin.org can not be confiscated.
@_date: 2016-02-01 13:54:57
Then what ? Care to explain here rather than pointing to their website ?
@_date: 2016-02-10 10:16:26
Because he registered it through anonymousspeech.com. Credit card is not required. You can pay them through prepaid card bought against cash at any local store.

The story is simple here. Craig Wright has previously opined for big blocks. He also had a old signed message from Satoshi. Big blockers used this opportunity to portray him as Satoshi, so that the claim for big blocks can be established.
@_date: 2016-05-20 09:41:45
Unfortunately, the most promising dynamic block size proposal, i.e. [BIP 106]( which accounted for a fee market as well, was never discussed properly.
@_date: 2016-05-02 08:25:15
Cryptographic proof that can not be disclosed to public is NOT a PROOF.
@_date: 2016-05-02 08:55:25
Proof enough that who signed the message is original Satoshi. There is no proof that Craig Wright is the one who signed it. Satoshi's gmx email ID is long compromised. So, this message could be collected from there as well as from other sources. The message does not contain Craig Wright's name or today's date. Moreover, he is denying to sign anything else. This actually prove that he only possess the message and NOT the private key.
