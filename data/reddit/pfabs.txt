Since you have provided zero evidence that the President said that, yes. 
Someone saying that someone else said something, without proof, is not proof.

But you didn't show any evidence that he has done it. You made a baseless claim and the person underneath insulted anyone that supports the President base on that.
Honestly it looks bad on both of you to make a baseless claim and try to insult everyone else that doesn't agree with that baseless claim

Lol. 
You showed an un sourced, un verified claim  that the President wants to weaken the dollar
Do you really not understand why you are full of shit?

I honestly haven't seen anything about the President wanting to manipulate the currency. 
I have seen China manipulate their currency for years and they have gotten very rich off of it. 
Is it really bad to have a president that wants to end other countries taking advantage of us?

Okay, I will bite. I'm a trump supporter.
What should I change my mind about?

Between federal, state, local and various other taxes, the average middle class American pays 50% of their income to taxes.

Feelings don't matter, I am dealing in facts. You are suggesting that your only tax burden is your federal income tax. That is obviously nonsense.

Property taxes on the home, property taxes on the cars. Federal income taxes, state income taxes, sales tax, taxes on your utilities, sewer taxes, drivers license, taxes on gasoline, state or federal licenses or certifications. EPA taxes. Pretty much every time you touch money, the government taxes it.

You keep talking about feelings, I'm dealing in facts.

When you move out of your parents place, you will see.

Get a job paying over $50k a year, buy a  home and then see if you say bullshit. 
@_date: 2017-05-28 17:25:49
If you own a home, make over $50k a year, than roughly 50% of every dollar you earn goes to taxes. Saying bullshit doesn't change the facts

I'm sorry but you are clearly misinformed if you believe that middle class Americans are paying 21% of their income to taxes. Federal, State, Medicare and SS would put a middle class American closer to 30% of their income going to taxes before you even get into every other tax that people pay.
