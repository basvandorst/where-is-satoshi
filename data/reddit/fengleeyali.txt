Bitfinex is going to charge people another 1% for express usd withdraw, after 36% haircut? can you talk to your company and give a temporary relief please.

you are right hold on to it and pass it on as your inheritance to your grandchildren

To this date they have not announced how they came up with 36% haircut, it wouldnt be crazy to think they took cash from the haircut and use them to buy the debt back at a fraction of its price. It is all part of the plan. Many believed the haircut should be lower than 36%.
