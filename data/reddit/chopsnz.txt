That was what he was asking about today so he is clearly tracking it. Volitility doesn't concern him. Old bugger has seen more than his share of ups and downs. He just thinks it seems like fun. He isn't risk averse and even if it shat itself or gets superseded it's not really going to have any real impact on him. It's his money he can do what he wants with it. 
If anyone does have any recomendations for some documentaries he could watch that would be great. Nothing that is gong to scare the shit out of him though. He still has the mindset that all that is wrong with the world today is that everyone sits around in offices answering emails and not returning phone calls rather than getting out and 'doing a decent days work' and getting covered in shit or losing a limb while doing so. He is pretty old school.

I just tell him he is an ignorant old cunt (It's a term of endenderment here). Not worried about bubbles. Life is gamble.

That could work. He'd just be buying. He plays a long game on most things. It's just a matter on convincing my mother it is worthwhile. She loves the sharemaket and does very well out of it. Suppose I just need to talk with him about how much he wants to throw at it.

Hmm. He could be into that. We have mental amounts of UV here as in actually sending people a bit crazy levels.

Probably true. Our family finances between me my parents and my brother are pretty intermingled and a bit complicated but it is always family first. We will take a hit to help the others out. I left a consulting career in London to come back to the arse end of nowhere and manage the farm (friends would visit and be like WTF! Is this your life now? Yeah it is. Now fucking move because your about to get trampled by that very angry looking steer) and look after the olds. My brother gets to make the bucks in Melbourne but he has his own shit to deal with with a crazy gold digging ex. We are a pretty tight unit. Our decisions are collective.

That would be O for Awesome! Just feeding the animals and then me but if I flick you my deets can I call you later?

Oh he is going to anyway. I just need to help him with it.

Yeah I watched a good youtube doco on it the other day which I will find and get him to look at which might help him frame it in his mind.    If he undertsands the reasons it exist and the social contructs behind it might help him. He does have a tendancy to go haring off with plans without thinking them through. He is switched on and mentally sharp and all the Dr's he deals with have to double check his charts because they think he is in his 60's. i just don't want him to crash and burn with it or Mum will never let him hear the bloody end of it.

He was given 2 years to live 33 years ago. He is like the fucking Terminator. You can't kill him. He is just one step ahead of the game when it comes to medical technology. So much so he is on fucking lists. They flew a surgical team out to Auckland from San Deigo to replace his IED years ago. He is like the Heneritta Lacks of cardiac research. He thinks it is hilarious.

I'm a chick and I'm 44. The Rents were late of the starting block.

Just a different world Bro. He gets it. He knows. He did his best againest the odds. He is a good dude and he has straddled the technology drive better than anyone I know for his age. He is pretty cool and he is a great father and I love him. But you guys are the future and he wants you to be in it to win it. I think he just wants to be a small part of it before it it to late for him.
