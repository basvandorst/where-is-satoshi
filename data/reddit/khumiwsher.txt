That's a valid point, although UX'ers may not have the coding skills to implement their ideas. 
I only have the skills for basic HTML /CSS. It would be very difficult for me to translate suggested structural changes into code. I'll admit I haven't used github extensively though... can you suggest changes using words/pictures on github (for a developer to implement)?

Don't buy BTC with credit cards on Bitstamp. It's not worth it. The fees from Bitstamp are outrageous, not to mention the fees charged by the bank. 
When I bought BTC through Bitstamp the purchase went through as a cash advance on my credit card, which comes with a nice fee from the bank. Of course, Bitstamp did not warn that they will be charging credit cards as a cash advance. Idk...maybe your Bank is different, but it did not work out well for me at all.

This is why it will never come close to competing with coinbase, unfortunately

Use GDAX to avoid this

I think you'll find [this youtube channel]( helpful. He uses a different exchange, but the concepts are the same. He explains things really well in my opinion, even going into the psychology of whats happening

Got it. I'm in it for the long haul. Honestly, I'm just really curious to see if it will follow the pattern. Bitcoin is just so unpredictable...I wouldn't be surprised if it skyrocketed again soon

Or write down the seed words...or store it on a paper wallet

Traders on the futures market do not actually buy/sell with actual Bitcoin. It is a cash-settled market. This allows for people to essentially bet against Bitcoin in a way that wasn't possible before. 
Many people are speculating whales are buying up BTC right now, driving up the price, only to sell at the peak and bet that the price will go down on the futures market. A big sell off would move the actual BTC price down and massive shorts on the futures market could possibly drive the price down as well. So essentially whales win twice. Rinse and repeat. Technically this is illegal (to trade on futures as well as trading the asset), but with BTC it would be really hard to track this type of shady dealing.
Although this is a very possible scenario, I have faith in the fact that this is a GLOBAL movement and all that there are many people just waiting to buy the dip.

no problem

haha...wait that looks exactly like the BTC/USD chart right now

That could very well be possible. Bitcoin could wipe out the need for banks. It is a serious threat to many large institutions and I don't think they're going to take this lying down. However, I have faith in the fact that this is a GLOBAL movement and there are SO many people just waiting to buy in still

I bow down to your meme and link mastery. Saved

They could make double the profits from shorting. A lot of people speculate whales are buying up bitcoin right (hence the crazy run up) only to sell at maximum profit and short them on the futures, driving the price of BTC down. They could then reinvest in BTC at a much lower price. Then repeat

Second this! MAPS is revolutionizing how we think of psychedelics and approach mental health. They're doing amazing work

It's a relatively stable store of money though

Can someone ELI5 what the segwit2x fork was supposed to do and why it was considered bad by many here?
