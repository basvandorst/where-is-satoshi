Lots of people on here commenting that this story may be BS.  Maybe, maybe not.  I can tell you that I recently purchased BTC through CoinBase with a Bank of America business account (multiple transactions totaling just under $1k USD) and just last week I received documents from Bank of America basically interrogating me on the type of business that I'm running.  Lots of questioning about crypto-currency and money laundering.  It seems the banks are being pressured by governments to collect and report information on anyone making crypto-currency transactions.  I've have this particular bank account for 12 years and now as soon as I make a BTC transaction my account is being investigated..??  That's just too coincidental.  Something is going on in the big picture here.

I know that the FAQ and BitcoinBeginners sections are meant to help newbies like me get rolling but I keep coming back to the task of buying bitcoins for the first time in-between my constant interruptions and distractions and not being able to get going.  I'm a researcher and I like to read a lot to avoid mistakes.  Right now I'm just simply wanting to purchase some bitcoins and make a few small transactions to get things setup for me and get the feel of buying/selling bitcoins.  I downloaded the BreadWallet app for iOS and I've tried to open an account at TruCoin.com to buy coins with a credit card.  TruCoin requires social media accounts to login and create a new account.  I tried to use my Facebook credentials and it said to wait on an email with a new account invitation basically.  That was hours ago and still no email.  Do you know anything about TruCoin or is there another service you would recommend?  
Thanks for any advice you could offer... Randall
