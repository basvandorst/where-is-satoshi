According to that, every new billionaire should stop earning more money and spend it. But look at all these rich people who aim to earn more and more money. If you earn one billion, then you want an other one. You'll also have different life goals and perception. Finally people like that want to assume power on everything.

I am not believing in Bitcoin. I have trust in the mathematical laws grounded in Bitcoin.

Actually it's good for bitcoin and its price. If many people own/trade bitcoin, it will be harder to manipulate the price.

Bitcoin dived by world population.  
21000000 BTC / 7442000000 ppl = 0.00282182 BTC/ppl  
If you have 100x of that amount (=0,28 BTC), this would be equal to 1% of the world population having bitcoin.

Welt is definitely not a leading newspaper in Germany. Since it is  published by Axel Springer, I wouldn't give it much attention. In Germany *FAZ*, *Süddeutsche Zeitung* and *Zeit* are considered as broadsheets.

Implies that this newspaper is the leading newspaper in Germany. In fact it isn't in no way. You should place an "a" before your title. But besides that, we (Germans) know how dubious this newspaper is.
