At the risk of sounding either a little paranoid or a little green, are you putting yourself on some government watch list just by downloading Tor to begin with? I understand the privacy aspect here associated with using hidden services, but there is obviously another side that is nefarious. I've always been interested in learning more about Tor to improve my general knowledge of information systems and am familiar with the main points, but I'm hesitant to start using it further for these concerns. Any thoughts?

What happened with the DAO was a nightmare and created no good solutions, with immutability being one of several considerations.
This is obviously a complex topic with a lot of opinions and nuances, but this is as simple as I can make it. A blockchain is a well-ordered set of data, on which all peers eventually agree. What all participants agree upon is construed as the single truth. This single truth is the single true state of the distributed ledger. The ETC community has yet to accept this truth. Moreover, and at the risk of generalizing, their reasons for not accepting it often seem based more on avarice than principles (such as immutability).

You will hear a lot of opinions as you wade into the deep, semi-uncharted waters of bitcoin. Ultimately, you will need to decide for yourself what to do with your money, hopefully after having done your due diligence of research. A few take aways:
* If you don't control the private keys, you don't control your bitcoin
* Always use two-factor authentication
* Focus on the fundamentals, ignore the FUD

The miners secure the network and are incentivized to do so by the block reward. With a private blockchain, one shared among a federation of banks (e.g., businesses with competing interests), there is likely no equivalency.

No problem. One piece of advice, and a lot of us here on are/have been guilty of this at some point as it is part of the internalization process of understanding bitcoin... don't be preachy. Bitcoin is an intersection of computer science, economics, and politics, and it is shocking how little some people really care about having a prolonged, civil discussion about any of this. You also need to have a firm grasp of what money *is* (hint, most people really don't know, but they think they do). However, your understanding of all this will improve your ability to articulate yourself across a broad spectrum of academia.

VCs (virtual currencies) are an increasingly technologically feasible tool for non-state actors
to deploy; efforts to destabilize confidence in a new VC are effective,
while popular sentiment is still untrusting of VCs for common transactions;
VCs are just like any other service in cyberspace, and methods
to successfully attack them are not meaningfully different than for any
other cyberspace operation; decentralization affords more, though not
total, resilience to disruptions from cyber attacks; and finally, the trend
toward decentralized cyber service will only make it easier for unsophisticated
cyber actors to have increasingly resilient access to cyber

People who think they can separate the blockchain from bitcoin (the financial asset) envision a centralized model, where a third party of some kind provides the incentive for miners to secure the network.  Technically, the two appear to be separable, but you lose the decentralization in the process, which is certainly one of bitcoin's strongest and most appealing features.

I agree, this statement is misleading on many levels.  Banks do not love Ripple (though some are timidly beginning to get on board), nor was Bitcoin invented to replace Ripple transactions, nor is Ripple Labs any equivalent to the Fed.  Say what you will about pre-mining and the ambiguous decentralization that XRP represents, banks will need to get on board with crypto some how and Ripple is ONE (of many) means to that end.  No it will not ever replace Bitcoin (nor is it trying to), it will however facilitate BTC transactions which is a net win.
@_date: 2014-11-27 17:10:21
@_date: 2014-12-17 20:27:16
Ripple is sort of a special case, as opposed to other crypto.  The fact that is pre-mined is a BIG part of why many (rightfully) are critical of it.  Decentralization is king, and Ripple falls short of that goal.

I'm already a BTC enthusiast, but I can see how this sort of gesture will readily encourage adoption.  I have actually taken to sending about $5 worth of BTC to my friends in the form of paper wallets and tossing them in the proverbial deep end.  No need to get up on my soap box and start lecturing about central banks and global remittances, just empower someone and let them figure it out, providing guidance and insight when asked.

Anyone who thinks bitcoin is a ponzi does not understand either the word 'bitcoin', 'ponzi', or both.  Maybe you should focus not on bitcoin but rather on teaching him what the properties of a ponzi are.  Remember, most people don't have any clue about how fiat currency/monetary policy works and they use money everyday.  Bitcoin has a higher learning curve upfront, but that's because it forces people to understand basic principles of economics (and political/computer sciences) before they overcome their skepticism.

Two things.  First, as a paying customer, let alone as a human being, even if he does ask to pay with vinyl siding, he does not deserve to be publicly ridiculed to a captive audience (25 people) for ten minutes for having posed the question (assuming he also extended courtesy to the barman, ie by not being evangelical).  Second, regardless of your personal opinion of bitcoin, it IS a form of payment today for goods and services and is thus a reasonable proposition (although currently unlikely) to suggest as payment under these circumstances where as vinyl siding is not (that would be more like trade or barter *at best*).
Edit: I would also assume the barman didn't know what he was talking about, but that is a personal bias to this topic, having been in slightly similar situations when pseudo-intellectuals have a captive audience.

I use LastPass (great product) and I agree that the whole internet could do with less scorn and insults.  To simply play the devil's advocate in this specific case, the lady's response to OP in the email shows a clear lack of understanding about how LastPass could benefit from incorporating bitcoin payment via Coinbase or BitPay (ie no risk, immediate conversion to fiat at PoS).  Particularly as a company that obviously understands cryptography, something that is fundamentally the backbone of digital currency, it seems like a logical fit.  My impression from her email is that she is just making excuses without having given proper consideration.  No bitterness on my part.

I'm amazed at how much backlash this sort of suggestion is getting, both here and on [this post](  The basic idea is about growing the community.  Everyone wins when everyone gets involved.  If there is some sort of impediment to the process, be it offensive comments in an online forum or the way in which people are selling the idea of BTC to others, it's clearly a matter worth considering.  If women are reluctant to get involved, for whatever reason, that means fewer investors, fewer innovators, fewer advocates.  
And in general, I also think we could all benefit from a little more common decency.  Just because you can post something 'anonymously' on the Reddit doesn't mean you should write something you wouldn't even have the guts to say to someone's face.

* They have native tokens that form the basis of all recorded information and economic incentives for using the system. The tokens are native as they are governed by the protocol that governs the data structure and have no external dependencies like central banks or financial institutions.
* They contain a chain of cryptographic proofs that ensures the data has not been tampered with, lest the chain of proofs would not be able to be reconstructed. The chain of proofs has the neat property that it reveals the amount of work it took to construct the chain. This enables the network to converge on one chain as the true chain, the one with the most work done, and discard all but one.

All I can suggest is to focus on the core technology, not the price.

If you agree with all that, then today's price volatility is something you just need to endure before mass/increased adoption (and presumably higher prices) a few years from now.

A good critique of his book, in case you are interested in seeing just how far this guy goes out of his way to misrepresent bitcoin and its advocates as a whole.  There's a video interview too somewhere.
Bottom line, if you want decentralization in your blockchain, you NEED a unique token like bitcoin.  So anyone who praises the blockchain but dismisses bitcoin, either A. doesn't care about decentralization in the model they envision, or B. doesn't understand blockchain technology.  That was my original post, I don't know how this could be misconstrued.

Although it is an important metric, I encourage you not to look at bitcoin strictly in terms of its market price.  Many advocates of bitcoin are not looking for a pump and dump, rather a financial shift where bitcoin is acquired, spent, and retained by both customers and merchants (rather than simply selling it in exchange for fiat).
Also, if your money is in a bank, then you do not have "total control" over it.  Look at Cyprus 2013.

It is my understanding that once you pay the ransom, you receive the key that decrypts the RSA encryption. Only alternative would be to brute force it, which would take a really long time.  Take a look at the link above for more info. Perhaps can provide some helpful feedback on how this works after the ransom is paid.

[Ripple Primer](
I recommend this document produced by Ripple, excellent intro.
I think the main thing that rubs people the wrong way (at least initially) about Ripple is that they see only the financial asset (XRP, which is pre-mined) and not the bigger picture of what they offer and are trying to do.  Ripple and Bitcoin can co-exist and further adoption will entail people recognizing this point.

If [Super Bowl advertising]( has taught us anything, it's that mass audiences like babies and animals (especially dogs/puppies) in their ads.
Maybe you could make a satirical/fun/cheesy ad that just plays up the cute angle while exposing people to bitcoin.

Arguably, this type of marketing is the only reason why Dogecoin is as successful as it is.

This was not a criticism of them, it's Letterman, they're supposed to laugh.  The point I was implying was that some of that laughter is laced with incredulity, which gives insight into people who dismiss new technologies simply on the basis that there is something "similar" to what is being proposed/introduced.  In this case and much like bitcoin (again, fully recognizing it's a comedy show), you find people laughing at a technology that they barely understand partly because there is already something similar-ish to it.

We're talking about explicitly coding a backdoor into an information system.  So by dismissing the relevance of this law, essentially your argument is:
*FBI says "Jump!", Google/Apple say "How high?"*
The central question is whether intelligence agencies can *force* (either through legal means or espionage) the IT companies to capitulate.  That very much remains to be seen, because at present they *are* protected by laws like this and they are not keen to compromise the integrity of their client base for the so-called invocation of 'national security'.

Just moved to Washington DC and was looking for some local places that accept BTC and was surprised to see the IRS listed (one of only six places downtown).

Not sure what sort of verification process there is for each listing.

Pre-mined means that the genesis block creates ALL the tokens in existence at the same time.  Bitcoin started at 0, Ripple started at ~90 billion.  A better term might be 'monopoly' or 'concentration of power', but even there I think the comparison between Satoshi Nakomoto and Ripple Labs is misleading.  Moreover, the percentage of control each has (about 5% for Satoshi? v. 70% for Ripple) is significant.  With Satoshi too, it is possible that he does not have control of these private keys (remember, he didn't sell *anything* even when the price hit over $1000) whereas it is a certainty that Ripple controls their assets.

No, not without imposing some sort of centralization into the mix in order to secure the network.   Miners are incentivized with bitcoin to do this, a third party/govt/bank could theoretically replace them in this equation but at the expense of a decentralization, which is arguably the most valuable aspect of bitcoin.

My grasp on reality is not the issue here, nor is the friendliness of OP.

Basically nobody understands:
* how fiat currency is made (and if they did there would be revolts)
* SMTP though they still send emails
* cryptography but they'll entrust personal docs to the cloud
My point is you basically need a high level of knowledge to understand all of these things at a technical level, but the *process* of using bitcoin/money/email/cloud storage should be intuitive and as easy as possible.  And I think that is what we are seeing more and more, making things simpler.

For whatever it is worth, one man's opinion and all, but I am developing mobile apps right now (independently) that only accept bitcoin as a means of payment.  Given, app development is presently not a primary source of income for me, and the app itself is downloaded (for free or at a small charge) via Google Play Store/App Store, but this decision is intentional and rooted in a desire to develop apps that are different.  I think we may see a rise in this type of curiosity, perhaps not to the exclusion of CCs, but in a greater percentage than in the past.

You raise some valid points.  However, I feel it over-simplifies the problem when pundits/politicians make these types of sweeping claims.  In the media, we deal with sound bytes, not cogent arguments.  Their fundamental point seems to be Nazis embody evil, Jihadists embody evil, thus Jihadists are Nazis, or that failure to act in Syria is a 'Munich moment', or health care reform is fascist etc.  Seems more like a watered down history lesson than anything of substance.

In general, what do you think [iMoney]( (and Amazon coins) means for Bitcoin?  Does the use of iMoney potentially lead to the use/integration of BTC, or does it compete directly with it and deter new users (ie why use Bitcoin when you can use iMoney)?  Granted, the ecosystems for each 'currency' are different (iMoney = Apple products and BTC = the whole world), but the level of trust associated with a centralized company like Apple remains pretty high amongst its users whereas Bitcoin still has some growing pains to deal with before mass adoption.

I very much recommend checking out Ripple, but you should approach it differently than BTC.  Ripple is a protocol, much like SMTP is for email or HTTP for the web.  XRP has a place in this system that is similar to currency/assets, but it also assumes other roles that do not exist with BTC.  Quite a lot to add on this subject, and the BTC community is often against the notion of XRP because it comes pre-mined, but I think Ripple has great potential and it is great to see apps being built on top of it.

Bitcoin is programmable money and blockchain technology is going to change the world.  Think smart contracts, decentralized apps and organizations, decentralized crowd funding that is like Kickstarter but actually shares equity with the investors (and not just a t-shirt).  All that power lives in the code, and regardless of whether you are a manager or marketer, you should be able to understand a little of what's going on under the hood.  Also, code with bitcoin is intrinsically linked to the crytopgraphy and hashing, which is the backbone of crypto-security.

Thanks for the comment.  I see your point about not really caring what Russia says in the sense that you are autonomous and not directly subject to their decisions.  In another sense however, markets care what other markets say because they are interconnected, just as the community 'cares' when the People's Bank of China signals a ban even if you don't live in Hong Kong or Taiwan or still plan to continue using bitcoin regardless.
I imagine that Russia banning bitcoin would also have a negative impact for those wanting to use crypto that live in border regions, just one less use case for adoption.

Sorry to throw out a cliche, but past performance is not indicative of future results.  If there is one thing I'm sure we can agree on it's that bitcoin is volatile and its price is essentially unpredictable.  While I agree that miners will increasingly have less incentive to conduct business as they do if the price crashes, I believe the nascent industry of 'hashing power' has/will have many applications both directly/indirectly related and unrelated to crypto.

* Paper wallets are good for cold storage, check out bitaddress.org.  There is also a good post on this subreddit about how to make a paper wallet securely, I'll try to find it for you
* Trezor is a great hardware wallet
* If you are just looking to do changetip, you can keep your funds with them (but I wouldn't store lots of btc here)

There are two sides to this coin, both seemingly inversely correlated.  BTC can go up and fiat can go down, each due to various circumstances.  One does not necessitate the other, but in the event of a major spike in price, one that catapults early adopters into the echelons of the super-rich, it is likely to occur due to both a strenghtening of the BTC infrastructure (which is currently happening) and a continued devaluation of USD/EUR et al.
Beyond these fundamentals, the future is quite difficult to predict (goes without saying).  However, governments will not let their own currencies go down without a fight (whether literally or figuratively), and world conflicts have been historically linked to critical economic conditions.  Thus, it seems that a huge BTC price spike (ie 10K and up) may also be somehow linked with a paradigm shift/major event that goes beyond the big changes in mentality and infrastructure currently underway.
@_date: 2014-09-08 12:42:14


Disagree. Many people I talk to have never heard of it, and those that have will hold a variety of opinions on the subject.  And this speaks nothing toward the developing world, where BTC possibly holds the greatest amount of promise.  To use a tired comparison, it would like asking people what they think of the internet in the early 90s.  *Everyone has an opinion if you ask them for it, uninformed or not.*

Glad that you learned about this, certainly one of the most important economic events of the 20th century and any serious talk about the future of bitcoin needs to be seen within this historical context.  Some considerations, if we are framing a conversation about a hypothetical fully-regulated global digital currency:
* Bretton Woods is directly connected to World War II, a complex topic in itself
* It pegged 1 oz of gold to 35 USD, thereby giving the dollar intrinsic value until 1971 when Nixon abandoned the gold standard, resulting in *fiat* currency
Theoretically, you could imagine Bretton Woods II where governments use the blockchain and entrust the security of the network to the IMF or World Bank, thereby creating a more centralized version of bitcoin.  Personally I don't think this scenario is likely, mostly because it would first require the USD to be dethroned as the global reserve currency, a transition which would almost certainly be surrounded by many financial and political problems.
This is obviously a complicated subject and please forgive any over-simplification of the issue on my part.

I think you are raising some valid points/food for thought overall, however I also think you are under estimating the importance of decentralization in this system.

You seem like someone who is involved with the homeless, so I'm sure you can appreciate the fact that simply just giving money to people, whether as spare change on the street or in exchange for a newspaper, is not ultimately going to solve the complex issues of homelessness.  However, at least in my experience, I have found the topic of bitcoin to be very inspiring, encouraging me to educate myself about computer science, economics, and politics.  This sort of inspiration and personal investment in education can lead to lasting change where people pull themselves up by their bootstraps (like learning to code using freely available public resources in libraries and open source technologies).
We are all doing our part in one way or another, and every little bit helps, I encourage you not to be so quick to dismiss the potential of bitcoin and blockchain technology for the less-privileged (and everyone else too).

Wealth is transferred, not destroyed during a major financial crisis/revolution.  In the case of bitcoin, I believe a skyrocket in price that leads to the type of wealth you are describing would be linked to something like the collapse of the US dollar as the global reserve currency.

Agree with and would like to add that a paper wallet is very different from paper currency.  Most paper wallets have a printed copy of the private key on it, so to give it to someone is to give its entire contents, very different from giving someone $10 for a $2 beer and getting back $8.  Also, generating the paper wallet itself has certain security considerations, something a merchant is likely not able to do.

You'll find that Ripple is somewhat of a dirty word around here.  It is sort of a semi-centralized form of crypto currency (pre-mined coins) that functions more like a postage stamp for other currencies (to include bitcoin) to facilitate their transaction/conversion through 'gateways'.  Fidor bank is using it, as well as a couple US based banks.  Think of it is as the banker's compromise for moving towards crypto without fully abandoning the status quo.  Lots of info on this subject, they have plenty of videos you can watch.

Important thing to understand about bitcoin, 'ownership' means controlling the private key.  So if you bought btc from someone on localbitcoins, you ultimately need to 'sweep' (ie import) the private key into blockchain.info (or wherever) in order to spend/send/use it.
Also, please note, the blockchain is the backbone of bitcoin and is essentially a distributed ledger of data.  Blockchain.info, sometimes just called Blockchain, is a company.  And if your boss is the 'owner' of this bitcoin in question and has just dumped this problem in your lap, I hope s/he understands that only authority can be outsourced, not responsibility.  Bitcoin is the wild west of finance.

All this is true, but I've had this conversation with a lot people who fundamentally don't understand what money is or what it means for money to be/not be backed (whether by gold, good faith, the threat of military action, etc).  At least in the case of bitcoin (and all crytpo, as you point out), it is in a certain sense backed (using the word loosely) by the faith in mathematics, which is a legitimate talking point in this type of conversation.

More examples of people praising the blockchain but condemning the currency.  You *can not* have decentralization without the incentive (ie a unique value token, like bitcoin) for the miners to secure the network.  Otherwise, yes, you can have the blockchain, **but** a central authority will have to intervene in order to secure it.  And that is essentially a database on a server.
This is the point these 'experts' continue to miss.  They essentially dismiss the inherent value of a decentralized, trustless system in favor of the status quo of centralized control/authority.

* International transactions between two or more currencies
* The 'unbanked' of the world (around 2.5 billion people) can have access to modern financial instruments via a smart phone (and in some countries, even a feature phone)
* Micro-transactions, which are good for online tipping or for machine to machine payments (e.g. internet of things)

I agree with your sentiment and intention, but draw a sharp distinction between criticism and trolling.  The former is conducive to the learning process, while the latter is just argumentative or hostile.  Granted a lot of linguistic subtlety is lost online, and sometimes there is a fine line between the two (though not very often),  but usually a simple search of the user's history (ie lots of snark, tons of buttcoin posts) can help determine the difference when in doubt.
I do not engage with trolls (an exercise in futility) and encourage others to do the same.  It's what they want, to get under your skin.  Unfortunately there *are* a lot on this subreddit.

In the long term, for those who advocate a bitcoin economy, this sort of payment system is not unreasonable and certainly not "ridiculously inappopriate".  Moreover, it would likely draw media attention in the short term, thereby potentially increasing sales (and awareness).  It may very well be a few years early, as I discussed with the director, because for a vendor to receive payment for a newspaper in bitcoin begs the question as to what he will do with it (ie there is basically no brick and mortar place around town to buy things).  With a bank account, they could do the whole immediate conversion to fiat, but then that raises questions about declaring taxes.  It is a complicated issue, but one that I believe will be implemented within the next 5 years in a major city.

They have fundamental differences, notably that Apple Pay is an innovation on the usage of legacy systems/infrastructure already in place (e.g. credit cards, third party processors), whereas bitcoin is a paradigm shift away from that (e.g. decentralized, distributed system controlled by no government or institution).  
It goes far beyond the idea of paying for things with a mobile phone.  To really judge whether one is superior to the other, the question needs to be seen in the light of the underlying means by which value is being transferred between two or more parties (for example, customer/merchant).
It is also worth remembering that Apply Pay applies to those with iPhone6, which currently makes up a rather small percentage of the global population.  Granted, bitcoin usage is not that large either, relatively speaking, but comparing Bitcoin to Apple is a little like... apples and oranges :)

Western Union is not "anywhere in the world", and let's not forget that sending bitcoin to another person does not necessarily mean they need to convert that bitcoin into fiat.  Plenty they can do with bitcoin online to buy things they need.

My point was to highlight the apples and oranges comparison being made.  It's like saying that a computer with no network card/modem is impervious to being remotely hacked.  True, but that computer also can not access the internet.  Security is a series of trade offs between accessibility and privacy and a few other factors.  With bitcoin, there is a high degree of accessibility (send anywhere in the world, anytime, for low fee without middle man) when you control the private key.  This is a razor sharp, double-edged sword, with the two sides representing proper ownership and black hat hacking.  We need to continue to find ways to dull one of its edges.

It's not ad hominem when you are indeed refusing to acknowledge facts when they are presented to you.  A business is not required to present intimate details of their transactions for purposes of proving bitcoin adoption.  However, Overstock has been somewhat forthright with this information if you'd care to do some research.  
This conversation started because you suggested that no merchants keep bitcoin at the point of sale, this is simply false, and it continued because you called people moronic for believing reports from Bitpay.  You want to debate  the percentages, that is an actual meaningful conversation.  I hope you find someone to have it with.
@_date: 2014-11-14 02:17:50
You see this more and more today, I think it's a hedge for people who don't want to go all the way out on the limb to endorse bitcoin as it is.  The only way to separate the blockchain from bitcoin the financial asset is to introduce some other means to of creating incentive for miners to secure the network.  This 'other means' would presumably be a trusted third party (bank, Visa, government) thereby eliminating the decentralization that makes bitcoin so revolutionary.
@_date: 2014-10-28 03:26:49
One small thing is talk to companies that run APIs and ask them to allow developers to make GET requests that automatically return values in bits.  Currently, the ones that I have worked with only return it in Satoshi (which also makes sense too) and then you need to do some math to convert.  No big deal really, just another step in the code.

If you are going to butt into someone elses conversation, the least you can do is answer the question posed before throwing out one of your own.  I actually got burned a little on NB and am quite familiar with the particulars, AA only served as a consultant to them.  Brewster was the reason that venture failed, not bitcoin.

Thank you for your response, even if I don't agree with your argument (or the argument of CaptainTrip for that matter).  One last question, as I would prefer to avoid getting involved in yet another back and forth debate regarding this or that point.  
Let's assume hypothetically that someone like Andreas Antonopoulos put forth his best 50 reasons (arbitrary number) as to why he believes in the success of bitcoin both as a technology and a currency.  Approximately how many of those reasons would you agree with without any significant qualification?

Glad we agree on this, but I don't see an obvious disconnect between the inspiration and bitcoin evoking it.  Sure, there are no certainties that people will take an interest or that crypto will be someone's muse, but just simply becoming aware of bitcoin almost always leads to asking new questions (perhaps questions these individuals have never asked, such as 'what is money?'), which may in turn result in the desire to learn to code or understand central banking or whatever.  
There is no mutual exclusivity here.  I believe that incorporating bitcoin into this specific system (ie street newspaper) does not necessarily take away from anything (I know I, along with the local BTC community here, would buy more newspapers if they took BTC), and it potentially leads to sustainable change, where for example you have a local coop that accepts bitcoin for food.  
Anyway, I'm glad we've found some sort of common ground here.
@_date: 2015-01-15 04:04:59
Well sure, and I bought as well with all this blood on the streets (including my own). But one could just as easily look at this and see a sinking ship rather than an opportunity. Basically what I'm getting at is someone who is new to this community is entering at a time wholly different than 2014, and it is nice to see that some people are able to see through the hype of the one-dimensional 'market price' and see the potential of crypto.
@_date: 2015-01-21 16:52:39
I too am someone inclined to believe in the inevitability of war (though not necessarily on a par with WWII), but with the word 'serious' in the title it seems more logical to frame the question hypothetically. Someone historians have even argued that we've already had WWIII (aka the Cold War) and that we should be looking to IV.
To respond to the question though, I think the only thing we could say for sure is that volatility would be even greater than it already is, and that the price point toward the beginning of the war would be dramatically different to afterward.

The point / counterpoint is about bitcoin being open source.  You have a lot of eyes on/reviewing the code and the core developers are very deliberate about making big changes, this is good.

As someone who purchased ether in the pre-sale, I can assure that it was made explicitly clear several times at the point of sale that ETH was not to be seen as an investment asset (e.g. like bitcoin is a unit of currency). Having said that, many people bought ether assuming it would appreciate in value.  The central problem I have with the scam argument is that the genesis block has not yet even been released, and Ethereum has done a lot for the open source community.  It is an insult to people in that community who I have personally met to suggest it.

Holistically implies that bitcoin is greater than the sum of its parts, and not just beholden to any one component.  If you watch the video, it is evident that the journalists are clearly more focused on the singular (and more easily understood) aspect of bitcoin's current market price.  Nobody is debating that price is irrelevant or unimportant.  However, it is not the sole metric by which to judge this nascent technology (as many do), and Armstrong does a good job of arguing that.
@_date: 2015-01-15 04:11:00
Some of the big ones include (bear in mind there are detailed arguments both for and against these points)

This feels like a non sequitur.  My point is that to do blockchain tech (like smart contracts) you only need a unique digital token where a price for that asset is somewhat irrelevant.  If you want to generate another currency to be competitive in a global market, you need a market cap that is much higher than it is today.  I don't see how this is a controversial point, though you can certainly debate whether bitcoin will succeed in becoming that global currency.

SegWit is a solution intended to address transaction malleability that also improves transaction throughput, the latter not being the same thing in many people's opinion as increasing the hard coded constant that is the block size (e.g., from 1MB to 2MB). Everyone is in favor of SegWit, but many see the unwillingness to do an immediate hard fork to increase the block size as politically motivated. There are also certain ambiguities for many people in Core's roadmap as it relates to the outcomes of the two recent consensus meetings. Ultimately people will decide with their hashing power, the nodes they run, and where they choose to invest (e.g., marketcap).

I personally believe that bitcoin is undervalued right now, and what is happening in the market is (unfortunately) typical of bitcoin's price discovery.  However, if you ask 10 people what they think on this sub you will get 10 different answers.
My advice was based on the fact that it is only $40, which in my opinion is not a lot of money.  It is however enough for you to get a feel for spending bitcoin in a real store (for a coffee or whatever, depending on when you live). This is very insightful to understanding the true fundamentals of bitcoin, which despite all the blood shedding going on right now, have not changed.

I see what you are getting at, but all of it together does not necessarily suggest a broader conspiracy.

This is a complex subject, and there are a lot of videos on it (check out youtube and search for Ripple Labs), but some of the key points include:
* Pre-mined, semi-centralized (in that Ripple Labs owns about 60% of all XRP)
* XRP is sort of like a stamp that is used to facilitate a currency agnostic financial transaction through various 'gateways'
* Stellar is a Ripple fork started by the guy (McCaleb?) who founded Mt. Gox (though he had moved on before the scandal) and used to be at Ripple
* Several banks have signed up with Ripple, including Fidor and I think another one in Kansas

I see the whole private blockchain conversation taking place today as a net win. These banks are raising awareness of the many facets of bitcoin even if their centralized distributed ledgers are successful.

From what I can gather, detractors over at r/btc simply don't believe that Core will ever raise the block size. Again, from their perspective, *block size* refers to the variable that is [hard coded here]( and is a separate (though related) matter to Segwit's fix for malleability and throughput. For better or worse, something tells me a lot of this conflict comes down to trust and public relations as it relates to this one line of code.

I see what you mean about being willing to change one's opinion in light of new evidence (not clear on all the facts myself). But I think at the heart of this story is simply the nature of Tether itself, and how certain properties as to its creation go against the spirit of decentralized crypto. I suspect a lot of what you are referring to as FUD stems from that.

If you get a chance to be in front of the class, maybe tell your friends to download a bitcoin wallet app (like Mycelium) *in advance* and walk them through the backup process. That way, they are set up already to import the paper wallet, start exchanging among each other, etc. Just giving them the paper wallet does not imply they will ever use it / import it (speaking from experience on that).

I only watched about 5 minutes from where the video starts, but basically (as it relates to 'who is Satoshi'), they have a program that takes a data set of previous code samples that are attributable to a programmer, and they can put it through the program and tell with a high degree of probability whether that person wrote the code for a data set that is anonymous. However, with Satoshi, they don't have enough known code samples of the "likely" developers to actually run this test.
@_date: 2016-02-08 18:06:47
Thanks for your detailed answers. Just thinking out loud here, but would multi-sig potentially mitigate much of the problem, or just slow down the brute force attack, or slow it down by only a nominal amount so that it doesn't even really matter?

As for scaling...
FYI, there's a bit of an internal debate going on right now regarding how to scale bitcoin, specifically regarding the block size and the challenges associated with hard forks. Good luck wading through all that, but as a statistician I'd advise just sticking with the numbers.

I agree with your argument, however there are still many people in the general public who still associate hacking with bitcoin, meaning the third party systems built on top of bitcoin being hacked is bitcoin itself (e.g., MtGox), rather than the protocol or blockchain.

Exactly. So how come you (and others) can't see that "coup/hijack/co-opt" is just misleading given the crypto environment?  Bitcoin is not whatever Core says it is. It can not be "hijacked/co-opted" (couped?). It is, or it isn't.

"I don't care" is an excuse too often given to mask ones own ignorance or indifference. Note, I am not necessarily referring to you but to the so-called 90% (or higher). If more people did care, about any number of things, the world would be an overall better place. 
In this instance, "I don't care" seems to be used as a type of surrogate for "just figure it out already, regardless of the consequences," and like basically every occasion when "I don't care" is uttered, I think that it sends the wrong message.

I've seen this graph, and it does not tell the whole story.
Look, I'm a pragmatist when it comes to crypto given the challenges associated with the status quo (e.g., banks). I try to look at things as either a net gain or a net loss. In my mind, the work Gavin has done overall is a net gain (the same is true for all the Core devs, btw). Are you honestly going to tell me that, all things considered, he has done more harm than good? 
We are all making this road as we walk it, and the only reason we are able to walk it now is because of those who helped blaze the trail.
@_date: 2016-02-16 16:02:15
Ask them if any have ever owned or use bitcoin. I've found that a lot of people have rather strong opinions on the subject of crypto-currency, but many have never actually downloaded a wallet and spent any.

I'm glad this comment was included in their letter, explicitly referencing both a hard fork and the increase of the block size (as opposed to the increase of throughput that one receives via SegWit that helps scale bitcoin).

I looked at the site on Chrome on a MacBook Air, and have since re-checked it on an Android Galaxy S3. The site doesn't seem to be responsive (or redirect to a mobile site on small screens), so to change that two suggestions might be to have the text get larger at a certain break point (e.g., media queries) and convert the main nav to a jump menu (can't really click any of the links when they are less than 50 px). Just look at the site on a smart phone to get a feel for the user experience, and do some comparisons of major sites to see how they do it on both computers and smart phones. Cheers.

This is the source of disagreement. If it is indeed a hybrid system, then it is both part of and not part of the government (certain aspects yes, others not). It really depends on your idea of inclusion. If it's an all or nothing proposition, as it is with other nations, then yes, many could consider this model to be privatized and thus outside the government.
In my opinion, it really comes down to who is beholden to whom (and who directly pays their salary). Janet Yellen, yes, part of the government. Chairman of the NYC Fed, nope.

@_date: 2016-02-11 21:16:13
Good response, thanks. My issue is that every time I talk the block size issue with Core advocates they act as though SegWit is *the* solution (even though its primary intent seems to be more about transaction malleability) and thus hard coding an increase to the block size variable for a hard fork is superfluous. Decent example of that [here](  including thoughts from Voorhees, BashCo, and myself. To the extent that Core can clarify this position I believe is to the benefit of all. My response in the thread above is to the comment pulled from the article, and if you call that willful ignorance then it seems you are levelling this claim against its signers too.

Some rhetorical thoughts/questions:
Before you do anything, you really need to consider the *real* possibility of losing money, and whether you can handle that. Focus on the fundamentals (hash rate, dev team, etc.) when doing your due diligence. Are you ready to go down with this ship (i.e., you believe in what bitcoin stands for as you see it) or you just trying to make a quick buck or what?
Nobody can tell you what to do with your money. Just try to make an informed decision, one that you can live with.

You may want to look into Coinbase/Bitpay in terms of their payment volume from merchants exchanging BTC to USD at the point of sale. Also, look at Overstock as a specific use case because Patrick Byrne is a real advocate and has been taking BTC as payment for a while, I'm sure he's made some of that public. Same probably with New Egg. Between those, you should be able to find some data.

At 1:28:40 Schiff says that he understands bitcoin, and then at 1:29:45 he refers to Satoshi "Nakomora"...
Sigh. At what point will the neigh-sayers have to admit to themselves that their doomsday predictions are wrong? On a long enough timeline, all survivability goes to zero, so is he proven right if bitcoin falls 100 years after he dies? 
I'm not suggesting that Schiff understands nothing about crypto, but I think the main thing that he gets wrong or at least does not incorporate into his valuation of this asset class is *decentralization*.

My issue is with the hyperbolic rhetoric.

As a distributed ledger comprised of unique tokens, the blockchain can be used to represent 'proof of existence' to verify any number of things. Think of it as complex math (the hashing algorithms and cryptography) being used to assure the validity of someone's vote instead of a guy at a voting station checking your voter id card and handing you a ballot.

I must respectfully disagree with your claim that interest in bitcoin is not relevant here. Interest very much translate to usage, and quilting is not going to potentially change the world. In the event that bitcoin is the paradigm shift in finance that many claim it to be, those who do take an interest (in the literal sense of ownership of bitcoin, founders of start ups, app developers, project leads, stake holders, etc.) will be the ones to directly and immediately benefit from this transfer of wealth, potentially increasing existing gender disparities across a variety of metrics.

Although BTC/USD (and other fiat currencies) makes up the largest trading pair by volume, there are other pairs between BTC and alt coins, such as ETH.

Be the change you want to see. Maybe start by establishing a local meetup?

Even better. The snarky chuckle you hear when she/others read off the decimal points speaks volumes as far as UX.

Well-written article with several thoughtful points for consideration. The conversation about bitcoin, ether, and one seen in light of the other - as well as the scaling debate - should be of this caliber (that is, logic and evidence based, whether you "like" a coin or not) and not resort to the (frequently seen) ad hominem, schadenfreude-laced, "it's just a scam" type attacks. Central banks are the real threat, not alts.
I'd like to remind everyone (as the author insinuates as well) that Vitalik has done a great deal to improve the crypto currency space, to include bitcoin, and we are all better off for having people like him (and other devs, be they BTC or ETH or other alt focused) to continue to advance this nascent technology.

I've met Vitalik several times. My impression of him, as well as his overall intent (specifically with what happened with the DAO), is clearly quite different than your impression of him. Regardless, these topics you mention are not black and white.

It's fairly significant to many investors for a former Fed chairman to advocate the gold standard.

While I agree with you that there are many options (this is a decentralized project after all), I don't think *impatience* is an apt word in this case. The question of scaling has been discussed for years, as has Segwit itself. Based on [recent blocks]( it seems like a type of concensus is forming and I for one will be glad to see us move forward on this issue.

Go to youtube and check out some of James D'Angelo's videos

I think you are underestimating the breadth of support here from all sectors of the bitcoin community. Certainly not ideal, but robust. The quote came to mind because, as I pointed out initially, this debate has been ongoing for *years*. Time to move forward, and all indicators show that Segwit2x is what is happening whether you or I like it or not. We all have to decide for ourselves whether that is something we can live with. I for one remain optimistic.

I believe this has to do with transaction malleability, which SegWit also resolves.

Among other things, this video highlights the need to (by default) use mBTC as a default denomination.

Any information about returning lost funds from NEO-BEE? He had suggested as much back in March, haven't heard anything since.
