Or, to put it another way, they were told that they weren't in compliance with the law. They had two options to take- one was expensive but allowed them to keep their security, and one was cheaper but meant sacrificing that security. They made the decision to go the cheap and insecure route, and now as a result they have lost their coins and most likely their business.

I think there's a big distinction betweens posts that are purely promotional and posts that are useful while also being promotional. This may be semantics, but to me "one of the main purposes" should be replaced with "the only purpose".
Is this policy about not promoting clients universal? If someone is posting things about clients that are less controversial would the response be the same? If you don't mind me asking, what is the problem that is trying to be resolved here by limiting discussion?

I think part of the problem is that you are by far the most vocally reasonable mod in this sub. If all of the responses to this situation were from you then I don't think it would have escalated nearly as much. However, there are other mods who seem to be enjoying the drama (or at least they seem unable to stop themselves from adding to it), and there have been decisions (such as switching default sorting moods on threads that have top comments making mods look bad) that really do scream of censorship.
If what you say is 100% true- that discussion of XT is fine as long as no one is trying to trick people into installing it- then I ask that you and the other mods attempt to make this position more clear.

Digital River is fucking awful. Every time I've had o deal with them they've been unprofessional, and from a technology standpoint they have their heads firmly shoved up their asses (I can't even tell you how many times their inventory system screwed up and sold me products that were not available).
Don't get me wrong, this is great news from the bitcoin standpoint. However, if any of you are thinking about using them because of this you should know just how bad they are to work with and avoid them because of that. Being able to jump on the bitcoin bandwagon is no excuse for running such a shitty company.

No worries. It's hard to believe a company so financially successful is so awful, I know.
The thing is they basically survived by being one of the first of what they did, and then through inertia. Most of the companies that are still with it do so because of vendor lock in (changing these things is a serious pain in the ass, especially if you have a decade of integration behind it) or because they really don't know better. There'a also a lot of wine-and-dine and sales tactics that make COO's who have no idea about tech pick things they shouldn't.

It's also alienating the community who doesn't give a shit about the block size but does feel like healthy debate and open communication are very important.

Right now the blocks are only 50% to 90% full (based off a quick check), so there's no reason to believe that growth will increase that quickly. The only way it could happen is if most of the miners were supporting the maximum blocksize at all times and there were enough transactions to constantly fill them, which is very unlikely to occur.

No one is claiming there shouldn't be any moderation. However, there's a difference between reducing noise and censorship. At this point multiple mods of this subreddit have come out and said that they are being forced to censor content, or at least stand by while it is censored, or they will be removed from the moderator position (as has happened already with who was one of the mods trying to actually bridge the community).
@_date: 2016-03-14 18:53:48
There's a big difference between dealing with brigading and duplicate content and censorship. Plenty of other subreddits have had to deal with similar problems and they have managed to do so without the type of problems this subreddit has encountered. 
Assuming you are right about the subreddit- and I'll say I do agree, not just hypothetically, that this subreddit was being overrun by bad behavior and shitty posts- I would claim that the response has been a harmful overreaction. Putting in place policies that limit duplicates is something many subreddits have accomplished without the need to straight up censor. Dealing with brigading, bots and clones is harder but is something the admins put effort into as well, and many subreddits have success in locking threads that get out of hand rather than simply banning all discussion.
What I'm saying is I agree with the problem, but I don't agree with the solution. I think it would be great if this subreddit could recalibrate it's opinion on things, take advice from some of the more moderate moderators, and explore loosening up the restrictions that have been in place while instituting new policies to deal with any problems that come up. 
@_date: 2016-03-05 16:27:44

You're completely ignoring economy of scale. As Amazon grows it is able to take advantage of efficiencies to lower prices. While people do cost money, presumably they're only hired if there is need, and that need (and the money Amazon is making off of it) combined with economy of scale savings means that shipping costs will not actually increase and make actually go down.
Point being this is a really shitty metaphor.

The BU people may not be interested, but many of the people supporting them might be. I think a lot of people just want a bigger block, will happy with a number of different options to get there, and are mostly supporting BU as they think it's the best option for it to happen.
I don't see how having a single hardfork to incorporate two features which require hard forks would be considered "two hard forks". A single hard fork for sigwit and for a block size increase at once would be a single hard fork.
Personally I think anything that can bring the community back together should be explored- especially if people are willing to do a hardfork anyways in response to the BU situation.

Because it wouldn't work the way you describe. The largest miners are the ones strapped for bandwidth at the moment due to the whole "china" thing. Being the largest miners, they would be the ones adding the most blocks to this system. Further, if someone did do this the miners who couldn't support the new limit can use SPV mining and push out empty blocks, which will lower the average- 


@_date: 2016-03-07 17:37:18
What do you mean by "the network"? 
If you mean the miners then that's already happening- most of the chinese miners are in their own datacenters. 
If you're talking about running nodes then I will point out that we are a long, long way from reaching the point where most people can't easily role a node up on their own computers. Bitcoin nodes are not having scaling issues right now.
@_date: 2016-01-03 20:35:41


This is crazy- if the policies are so unclear that the mods don't understand them then clearly there is a problem. Your statement also admits that some mods may actually be censoring due to this 'confusion', but then uses the circular logic that they're only censoring because we believe they are censoring.
The danger isn't that people are calling out the bad behavior, it's that the behavior is happening to begin with. I believe you are acting in good faith (as I've mentioned before, you seem to be one of the mods trying to resolve the issues) but there needs to be some work done with getting the whole mod team on the same page and making sure that the policies are clear (and if those policies include censorship then own it).

This is the downside to being in a censored forum.
@_date: 2016-11-26 21:44:01
There are enough people who are publicly against it where it will not happen without some sort of change (people leaving those mining pools to reduce their share of the vote, or some sort of compromise on blocksize). That being said there are also different pools which have said they will support it but have not upgraded to do so yet (f2pool, for instance, is having trouble compiling the newest version at the moment so even though we know they'll support it they aren't signaling their support in their mined blocks yet).
Basically, it's just too early to expect the number to be higher but it's going to continue going up for quite a bit. If I had to guess it'll stall out around 85%.
@_date: 2016-12-19 09:31:53
Virtual servers, in the sense that I believe you are talking about, aren't really helpful for the network as people hosting machines on their own. 100 nodes sitting at the same datacenter with the same ISP (often using the same software repositories and the same DNS as well) don't provide any additional decentralization than having a single node there, so losing them isn't really a huge loss.
@_date: 2016-12-08 19:19:41
Again, I did read it. What I saw was a single person who said that he had a vote bot using a single account. So that would result in votes going up or down by one. Hardly "widespread vote manipulation". Again I will point out that the reddit admins themselves said your methods were not good for identifying this.
I'm not denying that it's happening to a certain extent, but I do believe it is being blown way out of proportion. I just don't think any of what you've "uncovered" justifies the fact that anytime there's a disagreement here the answer is always "oh, it's bots, no one can actually think that" (not just by mods, but at this point by the users themselves). It's intellectually dishonest and is an insidious form of censorship.

Before anyone goes to nuts this guy has his numbers completely wrong. Here's what I wrote on his blog-
Did you misread the numbers on that website? Clicking your link and going directly to the calculator it says 7.467 mbps up and 1.0671 mbps down, which is a full order of magnitude less than what you are claiming. Or perhaps you confused Mbps for MBps (we’ve all been there, they’re awful acronyms)?
If you tried converting to MBps instead of Mbps then you forgot to do so with residential bandwidth numbers as well, so your comparison does not work. Just think about it- 16mb uploaded to 8 nodes is only 131072bits every ten minutes. Why would a node need to upload seven times that much data *every second* in order to be able to run?
@_date: 2016-12-08 20:57:55


I am 100% in agreement with you on this. It's unfortunate that any time I bring this up people assume I'm referring to just one side or another, but I do want to be clear about this- there has been shitty leadership and awful decisions that continue to cause harm to the bitcoin community, and none of that has to do with what "side" of the debate someone is on. I think that is basically a cesspool at this time, but I also have strong concerns about how theymos handled the situation when that drama was first starting. I think there have been multiple times where issues could have been resolved but instead people decided to throw fuel on the fire. I think that currently it's impossible to have real conversations about scaling because anyone who talks about it gets treated poorly by some part of the community (pro segwit? the big blockers will be up your ass. Want a larger MAX_BLOCK_SIZE? We'll you're an asshole who is blocking segwit. Also, lets refuse to even agree on terms so we can spend most of our time arguing not about scaling but about what is a block on a weird meta level!).
Which brings me back to my main point- it's grossly unhealthy for this community and this discussion if one side constantly dismisses the other side as just being a bunch of botters and vote manipulators. I'm not arguing that it isn't happening, I'm just arguing that it's stupid to dismiss people's viewpoints in actual discussions by using that as a reason for them being "wrong".

I could make the same accusation as you here. The basic fact you seem to reject is that the reddit admins, according to you, don't think your methods were valid for uncovering what you are trying to uncover. Your insistence that they are wrong is indeed someone denying basic facts.
Personally I think both and are awful places to have real conversations now. If you head over there you get shouted down for not agreeing with the crazier aspect of the sub (which have done nothing but grow), whereas here your opinions are dismissed because anyone with a dissenting view is clearly an evil big blocker trying to manipulate posts. I think it's a shame what has happened to this whole community, and wish some of the people who are in leadership positions (such as the mods of this subreddit) would actually show real leadership regarding this problem. 
@_date: 2016-12-08 17:38:17
I did read it! Then I quoted the part of that same post where the reddit admins said the methods were garbage because of reddit's own vote fuzzing. Rather than detecting vote manipulation it looks like they actually detected reddit's built in vote fuzzing.

It's wise to have a big safety margin yes, and I agree that people will still want to have buffer for their own bandwidth needs. However, I still think the order of magnitude statement is absolutely ridiculous and if you really stand by it I suggest getting more sources. 
Personally I do think 16mb is too high, but I also think most people agree with that. Most of the talk a year ago was about an increase to 2mb, and I think the highest I've heard suggested was 8mb (which I also think is too high without first seeing how the network responds to smaller increases).
@_date: 2016-12-03 23:04:26
First off I just copy/pasted that string into the website and can't find that quote anywhere. It's not on the blocksize calculator and it's not in the blog post. Perhaps you had it in a draft or something you forgot to publish?
Regardless, it's rubbish. The idea that people need a full order of magnitude more bandwidth than they use for a service is insane. I've worked my whole professional life in dev/ops, including a lot of site reliability stuff, and that number is pure bunk. Most companies will buy enough bandwidth so their peak usage is at most 80% of their bandwidth (depending on the industry that number could be closer to 50% if they are know for getting spikes in usage- but certainly not 10%!), as more is just a waste of money. Further, if the numbers you are claiming were accurate then mining in china would currently be completely unstable due to their limited bandwidth.
@_date: 2016-02-08 00:36:26


That shouldn't be true. The way tcp/ip congestion algorithms work is that they scale the connection up. You can see this if you try downloading a large file like a linux distro- it'll start off slow and then increase the connection until one end is maxed out.
This means that what you're saying would only be true if someone had an incredibly bad connection that didn't allow them to scale up after the first packet. Otherwise the second MB will be downloaded after a faster rate than the first MB.
This may be slight nitpicking, but the claim that it will take *exactly* twice as long is just not accurate.


Someone else in this thread said their node averages 20kps. Since this is constant it does add up (I believe about 500gb a month), but as it stands someone could run a node on dialup to handle verification without issue. Doubling it would prevent some dialup users from running nodes but is not an unreasonable amount of data.


I'm trying to avoid talking about the drama aspects. I am purely curious about how a larger block size causes more centralization. I understand that there are a ton of governance issues being brought up right now but I just wanted to know about centralization.
That being said, would you support hard forks with higher consensus thresholds (90/95%)?
@_date: 2016-02-08 18:58:03
If that's the case then why doesn't SegWit cause the same decentralization problems that raising the block limit does? It doesn't seem like anyone is complaining about decentralization issues with SegWit in the same way they are about the block size limit, but from what you're saying it should be a similar problem.

The numbers I found are pretty easy to verify. On the [pricing page]( search for "Data Transfer" and it'll show that the cost is 0.09 per gb, and 500 * .09 is $45. Admittedly they get 15 free per month for the first year, and another free per month just because AWS gives them that, so the cost may be closer to $43.56.
I can only guess why people would do this. I could be wrong about the bandwidth numbers (I did get this from someone hosting a full node in another thread). It could be the people running it haven't gotten their first bill yet and don't care, or they just don't see it as a huge cost. I wouldn't be surprised if a bunch of people just saw the post about how easy it is and ran with it, not thinking things through. The only free option I mentioned was hosting from home, and some sites are filtering out duplicate nodes from single ip addresses in their counts- hosting on AWS is a fast way to get a unique IP address.
@_date: 2016-02-07 20:34:11
Aren't we going in that direction regardless of blocksize? The vast majority of miners are in China, and with specialized chips and higher difficulty levels it's going to get harder and harder for people to mine without large capital investments.
@_date: 2016-02-07 22:10:56
I do'nt think we can conflat SegWit with raising the block size for a number of reasons. SegWit just allows more to fit inside of existing blocks, it doesn't actually increase the size.
I think this is an important distinction, in part because all the negative consequences people are worried about with the block size increase don't apply to SegWit since the block size itself is actually staying the same. So it's not really relevant to this discussion (how does increasing the block size lower decentralization), as it has nothing to do with raising the block size.

@_date: 2016-02-16 05:27:25
I was only using AWS here, and a 30x increase would also put people in lower per-unit cost tiers. 
AWS also has some of the highest cost bandwidth (especially at lower levels) out of most providers. If you look at digital ocean that $45 a month will get you eight times the amount of bandwidth (4TB instead of 500gb) as part of the overall package that includes the server itself. Their overage costs are only $0.02 per gig and they supposedly are pretty lenient about it.
There are also numerous providers who offer "unlimited" bandwidth. They do this by offering a small pipe and letting people use that pipe as much as they want. A full node uses about 20kbps, so even at a 30x increase you'd be under a meg a second and well within these plans. A $30 a month plan from Dreamhost (the minimum you can get that meeds the 2gb ram requirement) should give you up to 10mbps, which is a 500x expansion.
Even more importantly all of this can be done using most people's home connection. Even 1mbps (a 50x expansion) would go unnoticed on the vast majority of home connections in the united states (and we don't even have the best internet in the world anymore). My desktop runs a full node, as well as boinc, and I seed linux distros- none of this interferes with 4k Netflix when I want it, and the full node is probably one of my smaller bandwidth "donations". As long as individual can roll up nodes this easily (and this verify the blockchain on their own) bitcoin is doing well, and bandwidth can increase quite a bit before that is no longer the case.
@_date: 2016-02-07 20:08:58
Is that the main/only reason? For some reason I was expecting something more technical.
Are there any numbers for what the costs would be at different levels? I imagine a 1gb blocksize, for instance, would be cost prohibitive for most people and would easily lead to a centralization problem, whereas an increase of 10% (1.1mb) would be fairly trivial. How painful would an increase to 2mb be with regards to centralization?

I really wonder why that is, or if they're even connected (causation versus correlation). You'd think more people in the community would mean more people likely to run nodes, and more people in the community shouldn't do anything to with regards to existing nodes themselves.
@_date: 2016-02-16 04:37:34
$45 a month. This is assuming 500gb transfer (a number I got in another thread) and the highest cost AWS bandwidth (0.09 per gig).
I think most people are more likely to just run it from their home computer. I don't have a cap on my internet and can easily host a full node on my desktop without having to pay an extra cent in costs.
@_date: 2016-02-07 20:59:47
Apparently up until this moment I hadn't realized the difference between miners and nodes, so thank you for that.
It seems to me that there's no real incentive for hosting nodes without doing mining- you have to spend money but you don't get coins or fees back for your contribution. Am I following that right?
@_date: 2016-02-08 00:39:10
So the issue with decreasing nodes over time has nothing to do with increased users- it's all attrition from older users who are shutting down their nodes combined with new user base that doesn't care enough to set new ones up.

Yeah, I understand that. I did not mean to bring the blocksize bullshit into this discussion. I was merely pointing out that, with what you are saying (that the record of transactions is always going to increase) the cost of running a node is going to grow, which in turn may lower the number of people running them.
As you say though there are a number of possible solutions.
@_date: 2016-02-11 20:51:05
Your point on node diversity is a really important one. 
However, are you sure about the node issue? In a previous thread I asked about the negatives of larger block sizes and the overwhelming response was that it would make running full nodes more expensive (more storage, more bandwidth) and would make it less likely that people would host them. There seemed to be a belief that this would be a big problem.
I am also somewhat concerned about how to run full nodes in the future. I started up a new full node myself two days ago and it's still downloading the blockchain (it's 29 weeks behind now and still catching up). I can see a future where throwing that on my desktop won't be viable anymore.

What's this "gay lover" bullshit? Is gay love more insulting than straight love? What's this bigotry have to do with bitcoin?

While technically correct (barely), you're ignoring the fact that most of the time when people get sued they tend to counter sue as well. Not only that, but legal precedence from cases stands well beyond just the individual case itself. Look at the ongoing Oracle vs Google for what I mean- at one point that case effectively banned copyright/patents on all APIs themselves (although I think that got tossed out by a higher court).
The legal system is not a series of completely isolated cases- the entire concept of "case law" breaks that isolation and legal cases build off of previous cases and judgements.

Instead of your walmart example, where the private coin is managed by one company, imagine a dozen or so Banks that have their own currency. They are the only miners, but mining is still split between all of them and there are restrictions in place so each bank can never control more than a certain share of the mining pool.
Now they have a private currency they can use amongst themselves, without having to trust that none of the others are out there duplicating coins.

Okay, so you are just being a sexist pig. I just wanted to make sure.

What do tampons have to do with bitcoin, or this conversation at all?

I interviewed at Ripple. After that experience I will never hold any of their coins.

Simple market forces. Higher fees on bitcoin push people into other currencies, which in turn lowers demand and drops fees. You can see the [number of transactions]( for different coins. 
There are other factors as well- the hype of the bitcoin and eth prices have driven more people to purchase coins, which of course means more transactions occurring as those coins move around. Now that the hype has died down a bit the number of transactions has gone down as well, so there's less competition for room in the blocks and so fees drop a bit.

What these people are saying is stupid. They're required by law to file this paperwork, and it's not a automatically a taxable event. Any other exchange operating in the US is bound by the same rules.
Don't get me wrong, I think that Coinbase needs to up their customer service game so people don't need to complain on reddit to get things fixed. I just don't see how people can blame Coinbase for following the laws, since they'd get shut down if they didn't.
