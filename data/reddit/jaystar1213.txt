Rent + Utilities say, $800/mo
Groceries ~ $200/mo (pretty low but certainly sustainable)
I guess we can assume no car so no gas, insurance, or payments there. No pet, kids, or girlfriend? Probably.
Still have to have insurance so idk $100/mo
And can we tack on an additional $100/mo for misc spending, subscriptions, whatever...
So $1200/mo for this fabulous life. Assume this guy is 24. That’s a cost of living at $14,400/yr (super low but I’ll roll with it). Which means for another 50 years without considering inflation or increased costs of living or 0 change in lifestyle, medical care, etc
That’s $720K. Or about 35 years at $1200/mo.
So if you’re willing to live the bare minimum life with no car, pets, family. Have a very tight budget for spending money ($100/mo assuming you don’t have any unexpected cost). Live in the same basic apartment for 35 years. I guess technically $500k gets you somewhere. 
This was a super quick high-level outlook. There’s a lot of costs I’m not considering, and a lot of luxuries I’m assuming this person won’t have.
The people retiring with less than $200K did not plan accordingly. Technically that’s what social security is for but I’m investing under the assumption that I will not get paid out by social security. Especially not what I put in. If I do, great, that’s my monthly gambling allotment.

Because for a currency to be a currency doesn’t it need to be backed by a recognized foreign power? For instance, the “country” of Seaworld (look it up) has its own “currency” but any money you made trading it would be written off as a stock or physical property trade, not currency.

He’s saying devote X% of your income to buy bitcoin every month or couple weeks. Use it or don’t but keep putting some into btc and your value will average and hopefully in time your initial investments will compound.

This must all be specific to San Francisco because that’s crazy.
If teachers made $100K salaries I would have never gone to school for what I do. Teachers shouldn’t be making $100K a year, not without good reason. If that makes me an ass to think so, then whatever. I’ve had some very lazy and uninspired teachers. I’ve also had some amazing devoted and caring teachers. Paying teachers a fuck load more is going to do nothing but lower the demand for teachers and probably reduce the amount of people teaching to help kids learn over teaching to make six figure salaries.
@_date: 2019-10-31 15:06:41
Every teacher I know does just fine. Obviously there’s instances or even states where you have a point... but it’s not like ALL teachers deserve to be paid more. Or even most teachers. It’s not a highly specialized career and practically no one is in it for the money.

He talks about how C-16 can be interpreted and he’s not far off if you read the literature. It protects literally one group of individuals, catered for LGB groups (that’s exactly how it is written).
He even says that what they’re trying to do is right, but the literature of the bill is what bothers him and how it could be interpreted. Is that the quack you’re talking about? Or do you just not like that he’s religious without ever stating his exact beliefs? Those seem to be the two things people hold against him.

It specifically protects a group of people with a mental disorder. Ask any medical expert. The problem isn’t that it protects a new group of people, it’s that this group is not strictly defined and it’s literally a mental condition recognized by any legitimate medical practitioner.
He’s a clinical physiologist teaching at a university. Just his uncertainty to the bill sparked so much outrage from this group of people that it’s pretty clear why he raised his concerns.
Now he’s capitalizing on his spotlight which is entirely a separate discussion we could have, personally I like his presence but clearly most do not, some would have him silenced. 
I have to listen and tolerate some of the bs the left media and figure heads ramble about but suddenly a rare conservative voice is being shunned and protested. It’s clear hypocrisy that at least the right usually recognizes on its side.

I don’t rightfully know, I’m a bit curious but I’m not the fanboy you think I am. I really like him and a lot of what he says but I’m not an idiot. I don’t think people should have idols like they do and I’m not about to give him my money as much as I respect him.
But you can sit here and mock him with the same limited knowledge as me if you think that’s fair or right.
@_date: 2018-12-28 06:39:42
He claims a lot of people have been helped by him. And like any self help archetype, I’m sure it’s true. What’s so bad about him continuing that?
Until I see actual foul play I will continue to believe he’s just a sincere guy who’s willing to make money for his time. How many left valued authors and artists have profited from the other side of the coin? 
The only political undertone I can sense is one opposed to compelled speech laws, so its hardly a partisan issue.

I literally read right over that Kavanaugh bullshit. How that became a prime time scandal is undeniable evidence of the liberal media sinking its teeth into any story that would harm Trump/Republicans,. Yet all you hear back is, “well it’s not as bad as Fox News”.
Well it’s no mystery, the left has CNN, NBC, MSNBC, Hollywood, the internet, Silicon Valley and the rest of California. Conservatism is grossly misrepresented, and people wonder why Donald fucking Trump is president. You can even see die hard liberals reminiscing about Bush. Crazy fucking times.

Because bloggers and low tier reporters have an opinion? Jesus what is your definition of concrete? He’s considering possible ways the law could be interpreted.

The world is made up of individuals and the things that groups do are based upon the values and beliefs of those individuals. It matters, no matter how insignificant one’s individual contribution is.

You haven’t even provided an example an argument he’s made that you’re saying holds no water. You just keep stating how easy it is to do so, prove it then. Everywhere I’ve gone on this thread, the only criticism of JP is either misconstrued lies or vague hypotheticals. I’ve seen alt-right, conservative and neo-nazi far too many times.
You can give your personal impression, I’m asking for substance to support it. I think only it’s appropriate based on what you’ve said.
But I’ll offer some substance in favor of JP,
He’s talked about the need for both conservatism and liberalism in a functioning society. No one ideology is the best fit for the diverse world we harbor. And the extremes of either lead to tyranny or revolution, nobody wants either.
@_date: 2018-12-29 17:32:58

Why does he have to be against liberalism in general? Just because part of your fruit is tainted doesn’t mean the entire thing is. He has every right to stand up to the vocal and delusional minority. 
Why do you or anyone even consider him to be conservative, if he is he’s pretty moderate. He never set out to be a political figure he’s just standing up for free speech.
@_date: 2018-12-28 18:13:38
The fact that this is your understanding of conservatism is the primary problem with the left. Why is it that most conservatives see the clear benefit of liberalism while maintaining the need for personal responsibility and limiting government dependence yet most liberals assume conservatism is just a trap setup by the oppressing wealthy?
If you’re relatively poor you’re oppressed and if you’re relatively rich you’re an oppressor. That’s your outlook no?

That’s too hard for some people to rationalize. Or simply the idea that someone says it’s okay to offend others is so evil it needs to be stopped.
Either way, the people adamantly against JP really don’t understand what he’s against.

Of course he is worried about criticism. Every president in recent history employs a team to analyze and respond to criticism. Obama was similarly harsh about certain criticism, at one point his administration literally played the race card when one reporter pushed a bit too much on a certain issue.

There’s no libertarian ideals that wouldn’t benefit a black woman? What about decriminalized drugs? Lot less of her family would be in jail for selling or using petty drugs. No taxes on food or alcohol would save her money. 
Obviously a switch to a completely libertarian society wouldn’t be in her best interest but you can’t seriously tell me there’s nothing she can’t benefit from libertarian or conservative ideas. Especially if she is working and is independent, but that was your point wasn’t it?

He’s just a super sincere guy that has stood up to the delusional far left. The type that attempts to force certain word useage by law, literal attacks on free speech.
How he’s labeled a conservative is beyond me because he rarely talks politics and talks far more about personal responsibility. The only times I’ve seen him talk in front of legislators is when he’s defending free speech.
Not suggesting he’s everyone’s answer to whatever problems they face, but if you watch his stuff I’ll have a hard time believing you can justify the hate towards him.
@_date: 2018-12-28 05:54:54
I won’t totally disagree there. I feel the majority of people label him a conservative because he says a things that go against the general liberal dialogue. People are so damn entrenched in identity politics they refuse to not put a label on someone.

Plett being the primary force opposed to the revision of c-16 and wanted to add a simple amendment that clearly eliminates the possibility of interpreting compelled speech...
If it has nothing to do with compelled speech why couldn’t they add this amendment?
@_date: 2018-12-28 06:29:53
It’s in the the article...
Suddenly I have similar opinions as others that differ from yours and I’m parroting others? You’re saying the same stuff others are saying too.
He made up the law? No he’s only analyzing how it may be interpreted and he makes a lot of good points. It’s not like C-16 states you have to use these made up words, it says you have to accommodate for students who ask. HAVE to.
Even if you address and communicate with them in a way that is entirely sincere and welcoming.
In general it allows people to prove harassment simply by providing evidence of negative social backlash on whatever the party says. That could be another student mocking the first student based on what JP says. He’s a clinical psychologist and he talks about mental disorders, like gender dysphoria. Is it really that hard to see why this isn’t looking like compelled speech laws?
