Is this one of those "never again below 6400 even though it's currently at 6200" situations?

I thought the last dip was my last opportunity?
@_date: 2018-11-14 20:03:40

I remember when my bank account holding USD lost 10% value overnight because the Euro was split in Euro: Europa's Vision and Euro: ABCDEFG.

Don't worry, though... easily pass 10k!

It's just a weird thing I've noticed in crypto groups. Now if you'll excuse me, I need to go to the GROCERY STORE to restock my fridge. I hope they accept my COUPONS for 1/2 off Hot Pockets.

Funny how I remember you deleting your account a few months ago and reappearing with this one.

hodl and buy le dip, amirite
@_date: 2018-11-14 23:47:52
These aren't fundamentals...
@_date: 2018-11-14 06:50:12
FED and FIAT aren't acronyms... just say "Fed" and "fiat". Unless you're talking about the car company, then say "Fiat."

I wouldn't be surprised if this guy shows up on the news 
@_date: 2018-11-14 19:57:08
this is good for bitcoin
@_date: 2018-11-14 19:52:26
Guys, please don't kill yourselves over bitcoin. It's stupid. If you're seriously considering this, please sell some of your stack and seek professional help. 
@_date: 2018-11-14 17:01:58
Sure man, "it's the bond market that is crashing, not bitcoin", lol...

Prices are higher on Binance because they used USDT, and right now, USDT is worth about $0.96. For accurate prices in USD you need to use Coinbase or another real money exchange.

This is like McAfee levels deluded... You're super annoying, but I still hope you don't get too burned in the fallout. 
@_date: 2018-11-14 20:38:05
I've been here for years, I just use different accounts.
@_date: 2018-11-14 06:34:22
Why do you guys always capitalize FED and FIAT?
