Wait... 


But what if you used a knife and not your gun!?
This should really have been phrased as "If I dont murder, then I'm not a murderer."
Meaning you could totally still be a murderer, you just didn't murder with that gun.

Well they were right then...
Coinbase's BTC chart over the last year is up 19.05% as of me typing this... Good gains.
