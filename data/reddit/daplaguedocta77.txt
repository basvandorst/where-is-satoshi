Honestly man, moved from bittrex and took my biz over to Kucoin!  VERY pumped about being paid out in coins on their exchange to hold their coins.  Needs some update as far as the servers go, BUT i'm loving it man.

in world financial markets.  A
s we saw with
the 
development of the Internet, we cannot put the
genie back in the bottle
. 
Virtual 
currencies 
a paradig
m shift in
how we think about payments, traditional financial 
processes, and engaging in economic activity
.  
Ignoring 
these developments 
will not make them 
go away, nor is it a responsible regulatory response
.  The evolution
of these assets
, their 
volatility, and th
e interest they attract from a rising global millennial population
demand serious 
examination.  
ith the p
roper balance of
sound policy,
regulatory oversight and private sector 
new technologies will allow American
markets to evolve in responsible ways and 
continue to grow our economy
and increase prosperity
. 
This 
hearing is an important part of 
finding that balance
Thank you
for inviting me to participate
