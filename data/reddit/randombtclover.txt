Agree, I bank with TD and they know of my crypto habits and are 100% fine with it.

Exactly this post sums it up perfectly. I hate these 2 kinds of people. It’s no longer the good old community it was a few years ago.

I signed up just to say I lived in South America for a year &amp; a half. $1 USD is around $2900,00 COP(guesstimating based on average rate of USD when I was there but to be accurate to the hour using XE currency converter it’s:2,844.9461COP/1USD). A pack of Marlboro’s cost averages around 5,000 cop(around $2 +/-) more or less. so really cant equate South America to America because a satoshi is a satoshi in any country. It’s the fiat that’s inflated.

I loaned my dad 4500 once two years ago because debt. Never saw my 4500 dollar loan again but I still hear from my dad weekly. End of story. If your out of the house and old enough taking care of yourself. Focus on yourself. Dickish as that may sound, he got where he is because he is too proud or egotistical or something to take a bus or whatever it may be to get around. I know many many people twice my age that have gone from 0 to a home in 5 years because they didn’t let shit stop them.
