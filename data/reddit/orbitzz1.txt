They admit it themselves. Why do you think Elon Musl is so adamant about AI takeover and the singularity. He creates Neuralink to keep human competitive advantage, but really he's just an agent, part of the plan
@_date: 2019-07-23 12:47:06
Its already associated.
@_date: 2019-07-23 13:15:11
There's more than just the "all seeing eye" to associate with Illuminati and secret societies.
I'll give you an example: Simplex the processing company that Abra Global, Coinbase, etc. The CEO and Founder of Simplex is Nimrod Lehavi, not only is his name tied biblically(Nimrod of Babylon), but also the symbol they use for the company. 
Link here:
Is the same seven pointed star in Thelema, which was founded by Aleister Crowley, called the star of Babalon.
Babalon is a reference to the whore of Babylon, who Jack Parsons and L. Ron Hubbard tried to summon through a ritual called the Babalon working.
There are wayyy more examples, but all you need to know is cryptocurrency is apart of the occult and new world order. These charlatans/crypto influencers are just playing the fiddle, someday the pied piper will reveal himself...
Edit: added a better link for the Simplex logo

Can you please just research how current fiat systems work? Any research into the federal reserve, debt based, deflationary currencies and you won’t need to ask that question. Understand how your current fiat system works and then you will say wow block chain currencies are awesome, far better than what I’m currently used to. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:18:34
Well it has already been tested live and it works. Just need nodes to start supporting it. I believe it'll be a game changer. It'll Make BTC have more validity as a currency, which is what we're all waiting on. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 07:39:23
As I’ve stated, there are many other projects for more developed and better at being a currency than Bitcoin, but it is the first mover. It’s getting the attention. I never denied it being a speculative vehicle, I simply stated if everyone were o board it wouldn’t be speculative because as people on board it becomes less volatile. Will Bitcoin be replaced in the future by a better coin, who knows. Bitcoin does have layer two solutions that will further develop some of its underlying issues with t being a currency. 
I’m not sure at one point it will become a sham, that’s what consensus is about. It is legitimized until the point it’s not.. How can the price be absurd, how many unregulated, global assets can you name? Bitcoin(Cryptocurrency) is in a class of its own right now. 
I don’t understand your last question. What do early investors becoming millionaires have to do with controlling bank interests? 
@_date: 2017-12-10 10:03:43
More efficient currency system, that isnt controlled by one particular group or person. That’s the catch. It doesn’t seem like a big thing, but it is. I’m not saying currency is bad and flawed (it’s just a system for accounting) I’m saying the people who control the wealth and how it’s distributed are flawed &amp; this system renders them and their influence ineffective. 
@_date: 2019-07-23 15:58:57
It's fine, you dont have to believe it. It will be revealed eventually.
Just realize the future(New World Order) isnt run by politicians, it'll be run by corporations(technocrats) and AI
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:51:53
I ascribe it value based on the tech. I didn’t say Bitcoin was gonna be the king and gonna be the coin worth 2MM per coin, but it is the first mover. Why does it need to be a sham? Just because it goes up in value? People have been speculating 2MM valuations with worldwide adoption.. we’ve been expecting large price rises. Why get afraid &amp; call it a sham when the rise comes? 
The price has such rapid uncontrolled growth because there aren’t many ways to short Bitcoin so it is uncontested, we haven’t seen its real valuation. The real value of Bitcoin will come when you have a healthy balance of people shorting vs people buying. Now put that on a global scale... you might be looking at a balanced BTC around 200k, who knows... but if the world moves to Bitcoin either by choice or force(Venezuela, Nigeria, etc.) simply because their national currency is a SHAM. The dollar is the sham.. Then we’d all be in a better situation. No longer being able to be controlled by big bankers who control the money flow. 
So to answer your question yours and 
the spirit is not to get rich , but to rid yourself (freedom) of the petrodollar and the big bankers who currently oppress people with their monetary control &amp; seeing others success stories whether it be OP gaining to ability to travel and retire or simply having the ability to buy food &amp; living supplies in areas that have been brought to its knees by political and government decisions. The movement is being able to say this is mine, &amp; there is nothing you can do to take it(unless you shut off the power &amp; destroy the internet (globally)) 
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:46:16
I can’t speak for everyone but I’ll gladly spend my crypto once LN hits and allows easier transactability.

Okay, I will definitely tell him! 
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:36:52
On the contrary I believe it adds to the spirit of the movement. Posts like these inspire others, allow them to hope and believe in the tech that can bring them freedom from the current monetary oppression. It's not speculative if the whole world believes. 
Congrats OP. Enjoy your freedom!

I'm aware. I don't see it as drama because most of the people at r/Litecoin seem to be doing just fine about the news. Myself being one. Charlie is still apart of the creation and on going development, whether he holds some of the currency is irrelevant. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 23:53:59
My thoughts exactly... OP should've broken that transaction up a bit. Not to mention it's not just the exchange, I'm sure there are hold ups with his bank as well.

He's just a Bitcoin Maximalist. Any sane person knows there will be more than just Bitcoin in the end, it's not a zero sum game as some like to think. Monero, Ethereum, &amp; Litecoin and some more projects all have validity in their own rights. There are a few others that will also succeed in my opinion. I agree that market cap isn't a good way to determine growth or popularity, but it's a starting point.
@_date: 2018-02-23 12:46:36
Precisely, physical cash is un-traceable thats why theyve started putting tracking systems within the paper money. Another point to make is the US create wealth(debt) faster than our credit can build to prove the debt can be paid off. With crypto they kill like 3 birds one stone. They placate the people who want to feel in control and undetected(but blockchain is completely traceable) especially with KYC, they bring in New people who were previously un-banked (roughly 5 billion people globally), &amp; they still keep their infinite money generator so they can all become stinking rich. 
Once the adoption of crypto takes a majority hold they can just crash the USD and move their operations over. They could easily make a crypto that is only usable in US, etc (which is basically digital fiat)

You can open your own Lightning Network node and trade currencies. You can be that someone. You can use a third party lightning network node, but you don't have to. So in essence you don't "need" an exchange to facilitate transactions. Of course exchanges will probably still exist.

I agree. 
If goverments banned it, it would only be more valuable. Lightning Network Atomic Swaps removes the need for exchanges and the coin itself is still anonymous. The people can keep this alive, without government permission. Most don't even realize the type of power they have right now.

I don't think any coin would beat BTC as it is as stated above the default coin, but instead what I think will likely happen is BTC will become ultimate store of value, but because mining is becoming increasingly one sided and difficult for the average user I don't think it will be able to handle worldwide instant transactions and that's where other coins such as Litecoin/Vertcoin come in. 
What I would like to happen is BTC become international store of value LTC/VTC becoming quick transactional coins with the Lightning Network and each country having their own (traceable) state/fed coin because I don't think, as much as I would like complete privacy. I don't think we would ever see a completely untraceable coin.

A squeeze usually comes after a dip. That's why it's a bear trap lol they see the dip and start piling on shorts, not realizing the bulls are coming in hot especially on expected news. We are expecting this August 1st so we are all expecting the split and sell off. Some exchanges closing down will bring down volume and drag liquidity with it which will cause the dip, but once all exchanges are back up so like the 7th you see an increase. I'd probably be looking for the dip on 1st &amp; 2nd.
