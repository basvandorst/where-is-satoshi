Steam is an ideal place for people to spend their bitcoin.  I purchased a game the other day with bitcoin (Axiom Verge). I bought it on the developer site, but received a steam key.  Though technically not purchased through steam, it felt good to use BTC. :)

This presentation is absolutely fantastic.  In the last episode of Let's Talk Bitcoin, Antonopoulos surmised that the next big wave (the rest of 2014 and then 2015) would be bringing the word "Bitcoin" into non-bitcoin audiences and non-bitcoin conferences. In doing so, cross-market use cases of bitcoin would now be brought into light. I've already seen two instances of this now, and one thing I didn't expect was the high degree of professionalism for Bitcoin's image.
@_date: 2014-09-12 22:46:56
But that's not the price of bitcoin, but the value of costs saved by using the Bitcoin network.

"Coinbase has daily limits on my ability to buy/sell bitcoin.  Bitcoin ATM fees are much higher than traditional banking (when I bank responsibly.)"

I prefer to think of it as "full supply", regardless of the number of coins.  Bitcoin will be in full supply by 2039.  The number of units doesn't matter quite so much, other than it has to do with psychology and the number of "full units" that get rewarded during mining.
But I'm just curious... how would you mine 1 coin?

This is very normal in software development. Always start with the core layers first since that's where it begins. UIs are for after the lower layers are implemented.
Now that's not always the case (as I happen to be working on a simultaneous back+front implementation of a project in sync with another team right now lol) but that typically requires a lot of synchronization and potentially unideal use of resources as features can change pretty quickly during development.

My guess is, judging by the Libra hearings in congress, that the US government wants Zuckerberg to have no chance of running a payment network.  They're citing constant violations against Facebook in regards to breaking laws against racial profiling and more.
The hearings have become more of a beatdown on Facebook's ability to fairly express laws than any discussion about Libra.  From what I've heard (I've listened to most of the hearings), they're warmer to an open blockchain (Bitcoin, let's be real), than the payment network that Facebook want's to make.

It's not uncommon for companies to bid on any keywords related to their business, so this really isn't out of the ordinary.
But, it IS against policy on Google's adwords to bid on your competitor's names (So for example, if you searched for "Burger King" and McDonald's ads popped up, that would be against Google policy, those ads would be removed, and McDonald's adwords account would be reprimanded).
The interesting part is that this protection wouldn't be in effect in the case for "Bitcoin", since we are an open source project and not a company.  So competitors are free to bid away and show their competitive products whenever someone is interested in bitcoin.
Sounds like something the EFF might be interested in investigating (or maybe already has investigated?)

Yea totally.

This is actually true, quite astoundingly.

Now that there’s bitcoin, that means all people will magically decide to start paying off their debt? And not only that, but when there’s no more debt, it gets even awesomer?
@_date: 2018-03-27 15:59:28
What are you talking about? This is a good thing! My bitcoin is fine! EVERYTHKNG IS FINE!! KM TOTTALY OK WITH EVERYTHING AND AM VERY CALM BECAUSE THIS IS GOOD FOR BITCOIN!!

Expect to see this decision reversed when they look at the numbers.

Silicon Valley is coming for pretty much everything; Everything is becoming information, and that's what SV specializes in.
@_date: 2019-09-22 12:19:45
See now this is a good thing for bitcoin branding.
@_date: 2017-10-19 22:41:27
No. The original meaning is way better.

This is something going down for the entire stock market as a whole.

Oh man, why does bitcoin keep showing up in the shadiest of places ��

"A discussion about adding the bitcoin sign on the Reddit Bitcoin group (which has over 172,000 readers)"
I'm not sure if would consider number of readers as a support for an argument.  That's reminiscent of people saying "I did a Google search for 'moon landing hoax' (that returned 2,120,000 results)"

Amir is a pretty rad cat.  Good to hear his name again.

If they had this for iPhone, I would definitely use it.


Just the strange strange irony of that statement.
@_date: 2015-04-03 05:05:19
It sounds like they're behind the curve.  But, they are coming around.
@_date: 2015-09-09 04:44:31
Just another source for more conspiracy "evidence". :(

Their website shows an iPhone using the app (just below the fold).

Why does everybody care so much about Jamie Dimon.  Why is everybody reacting to him?  I don't get it.
@_date: 2017-05-13 21:43:04
I always thought that episode was weird.  In that episode, Troi had said "He is every bit as much the same Captain Picard as you.".  As a thought experiment, what if that Picard (that the audience was unfamiliar with) had murdered our Picard and and the series continued from there?
@_date: 2017-05-27 20:37:27
Awesome :D
@_date: 2017-05-25 02:55:28

Wait, people who lost BTC in the Bitcoinica hack are filing for settlements?  I lost money in Bitcoinica, am I able to submit a claim?
@_date: 2015-03-17 12:28:52
spendbitcoin.com is also pretty worthless. :(
@_date: 2015-10-28 00:00:34
Well that sucks :/

Can you invite Amir Taaki? I would enjoy hearing him speak. :)

This is quality humor :D

Sweet! I just bought one from Adafruit. Somebody else actually mentioned them to me for something else, today too.  Aweseome!! This was my first ever purchase using Bitcoin!  Wow, that was soooooo fast to detect payment!! BitPay ftw :)
@_date: 2015-02-13 05:15:35
Yes, most informal language is not formally correct.  But seriously though, it's ok, bro.  The internet is not a dissertation and its colloquial dialects come from every country in the world.  Enjoy the voices of the world and their vernacular. :)
@_date: 2017-07-20 23:50:16
He is pronouncing it correctly.  I'm wondering what you are expecting it to be pronounced like?
@_date: 2015-03-17 04:48:12
Even the tape, stapler, and phone seem dated.
@_date: 2015-03-17 07:59:56
I like "World Bitcoin Association", sounds badass.
@_date: 2015-02-17 02:42:21
so... he's spamming.

ooh can I get one too? ��
Legit, those socks are dope. ��
@_date: 2019-05-17 03:22:12
Aaaand it’s gone
@_date: 2015-02-13 05:46:18
lol @ the last sentence.
But that's cool, though.  I've noticed a trend lately in a few conversations and a few articles about the challenges we face when bridging gaps between ideological backgrounds.
Bitcoin is a particularly challenging concept for many many people because it requires a monumental conceptual change in so many different elements of thought that are embedded into their lives.
What is Value?
What is Currency?
Why is global banking so important?
What is monetary policy and banking centralization?
These are hard (and unnecessary) questions for most people in their everyday life, and they have no reason to challenge their assumptions about them.
@_date: 2015-10-29 23:01:55
but... then... he wouldn't be Amir... :'(
@_date: 2018-12-31 14:55:03
The fees are just absolutely ridiculous

That's tough when you have a huge portion of Bitcoin enthusiasts who are the conspiracy theory gold nut type.
@_date: 2017-06-01 22:31:19
Well if that's not a sell indicator I don't know what is

hodl to the end, my friend. ��

These local news stories are so adorable.
@_date: 2013-12-05 01:38:37
I think it's amazing that, considering the incredible amount of friction involved in acquiring bitcoin, people are still willing to put up with the difficulty just to get some.  I can't imagine what it would be like if the acquisition of bitcoin was frictionless.
a la this article: 
@_date: 2013-09-10 13:08:42
Wired and TechCrunch are like the Huffington Post of technology news; half-baked articles, click bait, and nip slips.
[edit:] Ok, that's not entirely true... some of the Wired articles that make it to print are pretty badass.
@_date: 2013-09-29 13:58:01
Autonomous bitcoin miners, anyone?
@_date: 2013-09-28 09:59:09
Apart from what everyone else is talking about, I would just suggest to keep the same voice actor and motion graphics guy. Both are great and the tone they create are perfect for Bitcoin. :)
@_date: 2013-10-02 13:57:25
@_date: 2013-09-21 14:13:38
On the contrary, this strikes me as a fantastic piece because it highlights a tangential topic in Bitcoin.  It shows that the topic of Bitcoin has reached a particular depth, demonstrating legitimacy of an ecosystem with companies and players.
@_date: 2013-09-21 14:14:45
I wonder if we'll ever get one above the fold...
@_date: 2013-09-21 14:23:03
Very responsible writing!  This and the new Wired article (Homeless, Unemployed, and and Surviving on Bitcoins) are refreshing to read.  It's cool to hear about stuff that's going on in the Bitcoin ecosystem, not reporters tripping on their bottom lip.
@_date: 2013-12-05 05:36:36
I thought it would be lols to sell coins that look like those in the pictures and call them "Bitcoins".
Wanna buy some "Bitcoins"?  They'll make you rich!
@_date: 2013-04-03 06:19:24
Coinstar is the worst.  Their fees are ridiculous and they just rip people off.  It's not a good company for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-09-01 01:07:09
I admire the sentiment, but, not exactly written in language that bankers would find professional or credible.
