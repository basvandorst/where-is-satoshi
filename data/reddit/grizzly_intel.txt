This is far more likely than corporate doing this.  That or a rogue barista!

Must be nice to only have to worry about yourself.

Literally depressed I couldn't convince my wife and financial advisor this was a thing 5 years ago.

Ayy mate twas a few pints in at the pub.
My percent was wrong. From 1 to 4k is 399,900%.  4k x 399,000% is ~16m.

Agreed but, It really seems doubtful that we'll see gains of 4000% in the future. 1$ to 4k a lot different than what 4k to 16m

So the price of beer in Bitcoin for the beer shop fluctuates wildly? What is the motive for them outside of idealogy to continue?

That sucks man. But you really shouldn't use coinbase as anything other than an exchange. You don't have the private keys, the wallet isn't actually yours.

No, your 12 pack was worth 15$ in September but that same beer is worth 45$ now? That is not "worth". The beer is not worth 300% more your bitcoin is.

Down is a fluctuation.   When the open in the morning and close in the afternoon they could see wild swings. 9900 this morning to 10500 now is a major fluctuation for a business.

How is it cheaper are you dashing in during dips?

I am ashamed I let "financial minds" tell me it was a joke at $. 08 .  10$ would make me a millionaire. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:54:33
Why?! You tripled the price of your beer since September

Give me a few days. I'll show you how hacking works.

What if the phone breaks? Better have paper backups.

It's called diversification. Finance 101.

Lol.  Man electronics break. Everything brakes.   How long would you trust it in a safe? 3 years? 10?
It will decay and die like everything else.
