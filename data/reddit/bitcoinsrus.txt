K, i just checked and I would get 0.092 roughly
@_date: 2013-12-26 10:03:46
and a few bucks makes a bid difference for me, so i guess it is slightly selfish
@_date: 2013-11-29 16:28:31
man, you are an awesome human being!
@_date: 2013-12-03 10:59:47
What i suggest is take a look at the site, look at the exchange rates - understand they take a small commission - but also realise they are the easiest legitimate way to get bitcoins. Let me know how it goes!
@_date: 2013-12-03 11:10:09
just put in $50 and see how you find it. The next withdrawal will be instant

Do i need to have a wallet on reddit for this to work?
@_date: 2013-12-03 11:29:48
let me know if you need anymore help, also let me know how much you get
@_date: 2013-12-03 14:05:29
Hmmm, personally i would say add more, i mean so far at least i've never heard anyone say im so annoyed I invested TOO much in BTC!
I did a trade in Cryptsy, let me know if you get any points, it was only 0.02 of a BTC though
@_date: 2013-11-29 11:31:16
yo, i got you, use virwox 
 thats my referral link, dosent affect you but helps me out a bit, you can use card or paypal there, its got over 150,000 users so is properly legit, if you have any quesions - ASK 
@_date: 2013-12-26 09:41:10
yep, thats how you do it
@_date: 2013-11-28 14:13:27
You could try virox, they accept paypal and bank card and have over 150,000 users. 
thats my referral link, it dosent affect you but just helps me out,
remove the end part if you dont want to use me as a referral
@_date: 2013-12-12 16:10:27
over 9000...
@_date: 2013-11-25 10:37:24
the guy who invested all his money in bitcoin was there about 6 months ago I think
@_date: 2013-12-05 20:58:59
respect man
@_date: 2013-12-26 08:38:45
Allows you to use debit card and paypal
@_date: 2013-12-03 09:59:25
Virwox is decent, you pay a premium but can use paypal or credit card. 
Thats my referral, gives me a small amount of sll but dosent effect you. Check out the site, it has over 150,000 users
@_date: 2013-12-03 10:40:16
Which reminds me of another advantage of virwox - everyone you refer you get a small amount off sll - i got 0.01 BTC worth from referring my friends
@_date: 2013-12-03 11:18:27
Well i put in £50 and got 0.075, but that was a few hours ago - thats $80, i'd use that as your reference. I would never buy off ebay though, word of warning. Final thing - price could have gone up massively even in the next hour, with bitcoin its usually the earlier the better.....usually
@_date: 2013-12-03 11:45:36
do you have a cryptsy account? I just made one and i see i can put in someones trade ID and say i referred them - seems fair if i put in yours seeing as you'll get me some sll from virwox - whats your trade id?
@_date: 2013-12-03 10:33:09
Basically it is instant cash deposit - instant conversion into sll - instant conversion into BTC but then to cash out first timers need to wait 48hrs so they can check its legit - but if your hoarding that shouldnt matter! I'll check how much you will get, one sec
@_date: 2013-12-03 10:30:50
Just sign up on Kraken, its a European exchange with instant withdrawal by SEPA, test it out with 100 bitcoins and then repeat. I mean, theres no need to rush, sell 100 a week and your still getting 100,000 each week! I suggest keeping 100 or so in case bitcoins really do take off. 
My main piece of advice - WHATS THE RUSH? 
@_date: 2013-12-03 10:23:39
@_date: 2013-11-29 11:43:10
i'm pretty sure that was sarcasm
@_date: 2013-11-26 09:57:31
THIS IS MY REFERRAL LINK, I AM NOT TRYING TO FORCE IT ON PEOPLE. THIS IS THE LINK WITH NO REFERRAL 
I would obviously prefer if you use my link though :p
@_date: 2013-12-03 10:23:59
I can lead you through the steps if you want
@_date: 2013-12-03 13:56:53
Hi, sorry for the late reply - i went to lunch - I see you as a referral so it did work. With virwox, the less you put in the worse deal you get as they take a fixed commission and then percentage. The fixed commission is normally on 35 cents or so but that adds up if its just $20. That spike does look big but if you look at the side numbers its only by about 20 sll, since it costs over 250000 sll for 1 btc that isint to much of a difference - especially for a $20 order.
If you wanted though you could wait and hope for it to go down ( and hope BTC dosent go up) 
  With that amount of money though you might as well just go through with it to get a feel for the system. The more you use VirWox the better the fees get + their referral system is great so i suggest trying it out with your friends!

swearing is rude
@_date: 2013-12-03 10:39:11
Just a little self promotion ;) 
If you have any more questions just ask!
@_date: 2013-11-29 16:41:26
Cheers man, but i don't know how to get into the wallet it was sent to :s
@_date: 2013-11-26 10:08:41
people are always asking how to get free bitcoins ect. This is a legit way, im just telling people about it
@_date: 2013-12-26 09:43:50
I'm not a VirWox rep. I use virwox and find them OK. They have a great referral system so im spreading the word whilst trying to get referrals - isint that bad is it?
@_date: 2013-12-03 10:35:01
Oh, I just remembered - for your first deposit maximum is $90
@_date: 2013-12-03 10:47:55
well one things for sure (imo) BTC is going up past its last peak any hour now. If no correction happens in the next two days that 2 day hold might get you more megacoins! Just out of interest, where are you planning you buy megacoins?
@_date: 2013-11-26 10:18:39
I'm waiting...
@_date: 2013-12-03 10:38:09
Its if you want to take your BTC to a wallet or an exchange
@_date: 2013-12-26 09:22:57
thats only the first time, after that its instant. People always bring this up but if you're in Bitcoin for the long run and can't wait two days for your bitcoins then maybe you should check your intentions
@_date: 2013-12-26 10:03:10
dude why do you speak like some sort of Spartan?
