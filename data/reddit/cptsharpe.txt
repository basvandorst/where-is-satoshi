I've seen people get paid random amounts of btc in these comments before today too, are there just people sitting on big wallets that hang around to throw scraps to the heathens like us or are people throwing their precious coinbits around like it's pennies to beggars on the streets?

The dream!!

TT_TT my wallet weeps at the sight of those numbers.

Are your folks deaf (sounds from rig) and also not attentive to fluxuations in their monthly bills? (electricity bill)

I also like to, even if it's been meh the last few days.

Good timing!

Hey all you predators out there, I'll accept your predatory donations in whichever coins you prefer to prey with.

Which I think is a smart choice, it was confusing at first and seemed unnecessarily so. 
@_date: 2018-04-22 21:29:10
Thanks for the advice! 
I'm kinda kicking myself that I was only a few weeks late for the 6k range.

I setup a Binance account but the UI was a bit much for me, wasn't sure how to navigate and compare what I wanted to. I do like the candlestick charts though.

Ooo thank you for the tips! That sounds like a smart strategy. 
I can get over the UI for that type of added functionality.

Coinbase and Gdax are supposed to work together, but the transferring between the two is hardly functional for me. It never registers my balances correctly and says I have seemingly random amounts of currencies available, when on Coinbase everything shows up correctly. Really been a pain in the neck so far, I'm looking for a better solution to switch to.

ahh okay so that *is* already it's own thing. Where is that unit available, like which exchanges?

a lollipop.... &gt;_&gt; 
hey doc...I got the suds toooo....

I'm new here, but I believe what you're talking about is a "satoshi"
@_date: 2018-04-22 23:54:51
Amen to that brother, watched a lot of videos this past week from that time. Sad boy squad. 
@_date: 2018-04-22 19:55:46
Hmmm, yea kinda feeling like it'll be the option for me for the time being. Once I've had a bit more time to research the market I'll look into alts. 
@_date: 2018-04-22 21:04:26
I've heard many feel the same way, who do you recommend? 
@_date: 2018-04-23 00:23:29
Interesting, thanks for the extra info!
I will keep bisq in mind before I make too many additional moves. I've got some research to put in after the replies I'm getting here 
@_date: 2018-04-22 19:43:33
That makes sense, thank you! 
How do you feel about Coinbase? The UI is so nice for someone new, but I can already tell it has drawbacks.
