A global, decentralized currency completely outside of the control of any group or authority is a tough pill to swallow. The 400+ developers who contribute to bitcoin core understand the gravity of this invention, and so do many people in the community. While the cost of decentralization today is higher fees, it's worth it in the long run to avoid being centralized. If you don't like the fees in bitcoin, have you considered paying with literally anything else? Bitcoin is still by far the best store of value in the world, but it'll take a few more months for it to also become the best payment network in the world.

Yes, but you need to first sweep your BCH private key into another wallet. Just sending BTC to Ledger does not send your BCH to ledger. You have to recover the BCH from your old BTC private key to send it first. You also have bitcoin gold and bitcore on your old private key. I use coinomi because you can sweep all 3 alts at the same time. I strongly recommend selling them for more real bitcoin. I'm way up from this strategy as opposed to holding the alts

Apparently Roger thinks that the developers who contribute to Bitcoin Core are the owners of Bitcoin and that the users are the customers. I can't wrap my head around how delusional he can remain after being in this market for 6 fucking years. Has anyone explained to him how Bitcoin works in 6 years? Maybe he just never bothered to study the consensus mechanisms or governance structure? Glad to hear that he has shifted a majority of his holdings into BCash because he is going to get rekt once Coinbase releases BCash to their customers. Hopefully his coffers will be dry in a few years...

Bitcoin is a currency. It's just the first global currency that is voluntary to use, so the user-base is still too small for it to be useful for pricing items in. I use BTC for purchases all the time. We're watching it grow up. Once the user base is big enough, other currencies will likely price themselves in BTC, just like how alt coins are generally priced in BTC on exchanges.

It would be super cool to make it a full lightning node too, so that users can put their bitcoin into an "interest generating" account that is used to route payments on their phone. Not sure if that's possible on mobile platforms, but it would absolutely crush it for decentralization, anonymity, and rate of adoption.

No they should not. Decentralization should be maintained at all costs. The reason altcoins exist is because less competent developers and non technical people can make a fuck ton of money off of the uneducated public. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 16:09:43
The fastest way I have found is to first transfer your BTC to a new wallet under your control. Then, take your recovery phrase (the ones that no longer contain BTC) and "recover" them in coinomi. Then add the derivation path found on their website and send that garbage to an exchange to dump it ASAP for more bitcoin! 
@_date: 2017-12-04 16:03:19
@_date: 2017-12-12 09:19:38
Incorrect. The blocks are full because bitcoin is actually used and desired (demand has grown exponentially). They are also full because people have chosen not to implement the most recent scaling solutions. The blocks are full because people like you choose to let them be full. Altcoins are "cheaper" because people don't use or want them.  RBF allows users to speed up unconfirmed transactions. It is not a security risk for confirmed transactions. Lightning network is onion routed payments that allow any user to participate in. Lightning network in testnet is already at 50% of the total nodes that BCH has. Payments through LN are more anonymous than any blockchain based cryptocurrency.

@_date: 2017-12-12 07:38:12
You are incorrect. The roadmap has been heavily influenced by cryptography experts and some of the best developers in the entire world. Blockstream is a company that sponsors a small handful of developers that work for core (3-5 out of 500). It's just that blockstream is owned by one of the original cypherpunks, so they understand how scaling should occur in a decentralized and anonymous way, like the majority of developers contributing to bitcoin core. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 09:38:54
We are witnessing the bootstrapping of a global currency starting from a user base of 1 and growing to 10s of millions. This is why it can go up 1000% in a year, be worth $11.5k, and still "nobody" uses it to buy things. Wait until everyone you know has some and stops calling it a bubble.

Cheaper and faster misses the point of bitcoin. Bitcoin isn't about being a cheap and fast payment system. It's about removing the power of money creation from Central Bank and governments, and ending the idea of inflation forever. You can store value in bitcoin knowing that your BTC will never be inflated or centrally controlled. Every other altcoin unsolves the problems that bitcoin fixes. That said, bitcoin is the cheapest and fastest way to make a payment with as high a level of security. Nothing is more secure than a bitcoin transaction.

It's true. A majority of new users are getting into Bitcoin hoping to get rich quick. However, I think that they soon recognize all of the positive traits that are listed in the video, and once they realize those traits of BTC, it makes "cashing out" look pretty silly in comparison. Worst case scenario, they "crash" Bitcoin in the short-term, but now know exactly how to escape the next global financial crisis with BTC. Additional users is always good for Bitcoin, regardless of their short-term intents.

Andreas truly gets it. Bitcoin has one chance to become the global currency, and the only way to do it without being shut down or co-opted is through maintaining decentralization no matter what the short-term social cost. Even if it means moving small transactions to another cryptocurrency in the short term. Compromises were made while developing the internet which is why we now have government spying and "net neutrality" debates. Net neutrality debates exist because centralized organizations can literally censor data due to the compromises made a few decades ago to scale the internet quicker. Don't like the transaction fees in bitcoin? Switch cryptocurrencies for a few months and come back to bitcoin when lightning network makes 90% of altcoins obsolete without hurting decentralization. Some of us are in this to see the world change, not to make faster cheaper payments right this second. 
@_date: 2018-09-06 21:11:29
BCash is not secure because the BCH network has only around 7% of the hashrate of Bitcoin. That means that at any time, it is trivial to double spend transactions on BCH, which has happened numerous times already: [
Bitcoin is already a global currency by focusing on just being inflationless sound money: [ 
That said, The lightning network is an entirely new network built on top of BTC specifically to be fast and cheap. It's faster, cheaper, and more secure than nearly every other altcoin, and certainly faster and cheaper than using a credit card. Transactions using lightning network are confirmed in seconds. I would recommend avoiding BCash like the plague. It has essentially 0 developers, has consistently proved it is unsafe through double spends, and is not sound money due to the numerous forks and lack of decentralization. Buying BCash is missing the entire point of Bitcoin and will ultimately lead to the purchaser losing money over time.

@_date: 2018-09-17 17:28:01
There isn't a single easily gamed use-case for blockchain outside of tracking a native digital asset (Cryptocurrencies), which are only secure with enough PoW. Printing money is not valuable, therefore the hardest, most decentralized, most secure digital currency will become the global currency over time (Bitcoin).

This is completely false. Users run nodes which uphold the consensus rules that the node operators choose, and hold bitcoin. Miners validate transactions, and get their transactions checked by the nodes, and hold bitcoin. Developers can submit new development, but can't force anyone to run their software, and they hold bitcoin too. Nobody "owns" Bitcoin, by design. The incentive structure of maintaining and growing it in value ensure that the players act for the ultimate good of the system. The more one actor tries to force their will onto Bitcoin, the more bitcoin resists.

You should definitely not buy bitcoin. You don't understand it and aren't ready for it. You'll understand it when it becomes an economic necessity for you. Bitcoin doesn't need the US to adopt it. The US has less than 5% of the world's population. You don't matter. I don't matter. What matters is what the rest of the world does. They are economically incentivized to adopt bitcoin sooner than the US because right now they're subjected to the whims of the US government and Federal reserve thanks to the USD being the global reserve currency for the last 70 years. Remember this conversation in 5 years, Dumbass.

Bitcoin doesn't need an ETF to succeed, but the US might need an ETF to maintain its position in the world over the next decade.

The USD has been the global reserve currency for about 3-4 generations, giving the US immense amounts of power to influence the world. As a result, almost nobody in the US is aware that government money is a house of cards and always trends towards hyperinflation. Those that experience crappy government money instantly recognize bitcoin's value as a non Inflationary global currency outside of anyone's control, giving other countries an advantage in becoming early bitcoin adopters. Those with the most money (or control of the money) generally have the most power. Turkey's BTC adoption rate is estimated to be 18%, whereas the US has roughly 8-9% adoption. The US is going to get caught off-guard if it doesn't step up its game.

The Chinese investors clearly understand how to play the game. All they have to do is fudge a few numbers on a document, and the broken-ass crony capitalist US financial system will make them wealthy beyond their wildest dreams. The incentives of the US financial system are all wrong! Everybody along the way is just following the path to make more money while knowing in the back of their minds the entire time that they are fucking over the future! There's nothing each individual actor can do until the entire thing explodes. Fuck that noise, defund the system and buy Bitcoin. Time for a global reset.

Bitcoin will be used by everyone if it isn't killed. Everyone is already participating and most people don't realize it.  Jamie Dimon, Nouriel Roubini, Frances Coppola, David Gerard.... Everyone. The difference is that now we don't need to rely on a centralized service if we don't want to. There are more options, and more options means freedom. Fidelity is an inevitability. Just enjoy them making you rich while you HODL your private keys.

Privacy will not turn into a "civil war." Upgrades to Bitcoin will almost certainly no longer rely on a minority of full node operators (like miners) to activate them, like they did in the past. Full node operators will activate upgrades based on a majority running the upgrades that they choose. Just because large institutions have more capital than individual node operators, it does not mean that they have any more control of the network, which was demonstrated to a somewhat lesser extent with the SegWit2X fiasco of last year.

Lets think about this a bit - Russia, China, Japan, India, Australia, Switzerland, and more are ramping up their Bitcoin infrastructure. Even though global adoption of Bitcoin is 'unlikely' according to the 'experts,' since it is a global currency, the game works out so that the first country to begin hoarding it will become the wealthiest country in the world if Bitcoin does become globally adopted. If Bitcoin is 'crushed' by a big government, what will happen to that country if Bitcoin becomes the new global reserve currency? My prediction is that we will see a small to midsized country going through hyperinflation be the first to adopt Bitcoin as a national currency. All of their allies, and definitely their opponents, will begin hoarding Bitcoin as well. I think that the opposite of this article is true - Big governments will usher in the new Bitcoin economy through FOMO after a single country adopts it.

I look at the new exchange accounts created and wallets downloaded as a good leading indicator that price will be increasing mid-term. For example, the last 3 months has seen Coinbase's total user base increase by about 30%. People generally start out with small investments and then increase their investments over time. The dips are getting much, much shorter than they used to because you have more than 30% more people using this scarce digital currency and waiting to buy the dip. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 13:42:02
I disagree. What we are seeing is possibly the purest market example of the econ 101 theory of supply and demand. The price on a given day might fluctuate, but focus on the rate of adoption. The supply of bitcoin is completely public. Demand is the only variable in the equation. I guarantee you that as long as demand continues up, price will follow. I guess you could say that predicting whether demand will increase is speculative, but it seems to be following the normal adoption cycle of any new technology.

What are you gaining by attempting to convince people that it is specifically not an investment? Bitcoin is a scarce digital asset that can be used as a global currency, and as a store of value outside of the traditional financial system. It's a currency and a commodity.

We are now living through the greatest global economic experiment ever conducted in the history of mankind, and it's called negative interest rates, quantitative easing, and money as a system of control. If you don't want to risk your wealth at the hands of a small group of individuals (mostly in the US), there's this software out there that has very simple properties, that when combined, turn into something incredibly safe and highly anti-fragile. The software is called bitcoin, and there will only ever be 21 million bitcoins ever produced. You can send them anywhere in the world nearly instantly and nothing can censor your transaction. The price of a bitcoin is determined exclusively by the demand for it. Demand has started from zero in 2009 and has grown to what it is today.

WEAK! Instead of watching TV this evening, take a few hours to set up a hardware wallet. How would you feel if you lost a life-changing amount of money because you were incapable of taking responsibility for yourself and learning just one more thing? Here are the steps to set up a hardware wallet: 
1. Buy a hardware wallet
2. follow the instructions included with the purchase of your hardware wallet.
3. send your BTC from Coinbase to your new hardware wallet address.

There are over 400 developers working on Bitcoin Core, and they overwhelmingly do not support the SegWit2X strategy. Bitcoin Core is open source software. Anyone can submit development and that development will be included in Bitcoin if it is deemed safe and does not impact decentralization. Once the dev is released, it takes people in the community to run the software for the change to be incorporated. B2X is trying to co-opt an open source software's name and is attempting a change that impacts decentralization without achieving consensus from users or a majority of the best developers in the cryptocurrency space. It does so in a way that could cause damage to the entire cryptocurrency industry. They are able to attempt this because they have a lot of money. I am excited to be redistributing some of that money into my pocket.

Counterpoint: Bitcoin has a maximum limit of 21 million full Bitcoins, and a majority of users are HODLers, not traders. In the last 18 days, Coinbase has signed up 1.1 million new users, and they have signed up 3.1 million new users in the last 3 months (a 30% increase in their total user base). Since the supply is fixed, and the demand is increasing exponentially with a majority of new users getting into it as HODLers, Bitcoin is going to the fucking moon.

Nobody in the world cares more about finding cheap electricity than Bitcoin miners do. Renewable energy sources are the cheapest. Bitcoin mining literally increases demand for renewable energy. Bitcoin mining is ruthlessly competitive. They need efficient chips, cheap electricity, and the price of Bitcoin to increase to make a profit.
The problem is not that Bitcoin mining uses too much electricity. The problem is that powering your friend's DJ equipment is too cheap so they don't know/care to figure out where their electricity comes from.

Bitcoin isn't a company. It's the very first scarce resource that lives exclusively on the internet. It's easier to compare it to different "real world" resources (gold, silver, platinum, oil, coal etc.). It's possible that another cryptocurrency eventually becomes bigger than Bitcoin, but Bitcoin will always play some role in cryptocurrency because it was the first, currently has the most development resources at the protocol level, and does not have a leader that can "get shot for being the first through the door." Don't let the idea of Bitcoin potentially being surpassed by another crypto prevent you from getting Bitcoin in the first place.

There's a very large bounty of bitcoin that are using SegWit. Why doesn't the author steal some since it's so unsafe? Oh, that's right, because SegWit transactions are just as safe as any other transactions. SegWit is just as safe to use, and it's much cheaper for users. Who benefits from putting out articles like this? Maybe people who don't want bitcoin to scale on second layers or people who want to keep bitcoin transactions expensive. Maybe companies who have had strategic advantages nullified by SegWit, or whose business model relies on making tons of inefficient transactions and offloading the data burden to the public? Be incredibly skeptical of articles that go against what was obviously consensus (activating SegWit). They generally have an anti bitcoin agenda.

I actually think there is a chance that Venezuela going all-in on crypto could do some serious damage to the USD. Creating their own shitcoin seems like a bad strategy to me though. If they are acknowledging that cryptocurrencies are the future, why wouldn't they be the change they want to see in the world and buy up all of the Bitcoin (I'm not fucking selling BTW)? By betting on their own shitcoin, they are attempting to maintain control of their currency, but by teaching their citizens about crypto, it will inevitably lead a substantial portion of them to buying Bitcoin instead. They could beat their citizens to it by buying a ton of Bitcoin before them, and therefore keep more control over them. If you're a corrupt government, feel free to PM me for more unsolicited strategic advice.

There is a ton of innovation happening nonstop with Bitcoin (SegWit, lightning, schnorr, mimblewimble, etc).

This is dangerous advice. The reason bitcoin was created was to become sound currency for the entire world. Adoption has been steadily increasing for the last 9.5 years.

@_date: 2017-06-19 20:22:37
That would happen if there was literally 0 Miner support, which is objectively not the case already. Since people want to mine SegWit blocks, those that choose to attempt to prevent them from doing so will be split onto a chain that no longer follows the rules and has a chance to reorg. It would be way safer for the miners opposed to SegWit to just signal it and continue mining old formatted blocks, unless they had some kind of technological advantage to preventing other miners from using Segwit *cough ASICBoost cough* 
@_date: 2017-06-11 11:37:08
It's not normal to have such a high fee. It's due to the popularity of Bitcoin right now and the limitations of the network to handle the new popularity. There's code available right now to allow Bitcoin to scale but it has not been activated yet due to the manner in which activation was set to occur. Luckily, we should get the enhancement before August 1 as long as companies like coinbase support it. Coinbase had announced support for the upgrade in the past, but have not yet shown support for the new activation method. Their support will help immensely to get fees lower before August 1. 
@_date: 2017-06-14 08:37:37
I agree. Now that Bitmain has formally announced their intentions to create their Altcoin with the hard fork, SegWit has unanimous support. BIP148 will ensure that SegWit activates on or before August 1.

Exactly. The decision to split the chain is made by the miners not signaling SegWit, not the users who run BIP148, or anyone else with a vested interest in Bitcoin. Only malicious actors would want the split chain outcome. Everyone who is not currently signaling SegWit is signaling for a chain split.

He mentions that banks try to adjust the inflation rates so that they are perfect to simulate growth. Who are the rates perfect for? For me, I choose to no longer have my wealth inflated away because bitcoin makes that an option for me. Re: volatility. Bitcoin is the first asset that is uninflatable, so nothing can increase/decrease supply to meet demand. This means that demand is exclusively responsible for price. It will become less volatile over time as demand continues to increase. The volatility is the risk early adopters must deal with to make the gainz. Freedom isn't free. 
@_date: 2018-12-27 18:23:37

Yeah, I agree that it is frustrating to see all of the major exchanges currently voting in favor of a chain split. They will be in trouble unless they support BIP148, and if miners decide to split the chain. 
@_date: 2017-06-14 08:46:45
I disagree. I think bitmain creating their altcoin on August 1 and having it fail will be the absolute best possible outcome. Bitmain needs to learn not to bite the hand that feeds them. Bitcoin might dip in value in the short term, but honey badgers wake right the fuck back up after napping off a poisonous snake bite. Creating a new global reserve currency that is immune to malicious individuals was never going to be easy. That's why we have the rollercoaster guy as the official mascot.

Hi, I agree the fees for Bitcoin are getting too high for many small transaction use cases. I think at this point the best thing you can do to reduce the fees is to email coinbase and ask them what they are doing to support the scaling solution that activates on or before August 1. 
@_date: 2017-06-01 14:00:40
I think that miners will wait until 2-3 weeks before August 1st and then activate SegWit. With the price where it is right now and the global demand increasing, miners will want to absorb every last Satoshi worth of covertly AsicBoosted BTC and then switch to SegWit to avoid the chain split and to avoid people cashing out in anticipation of a chain split.
@_date: 2017-06-07 12:28:00
Are you willing to bet $40 Billion on that? I'm not. 
@_date: 2017-06-07 11:30:04
Yep. By voting to split the chain, you are wagering that the legacy chain will never be reorganized back into the version of the chain with stricter rules. If it does get split, miners could have a substantial number of coins that will no longer be valid on the blockchain for a non-negligible amount of users after August 1, so the only way the "legacy" chain can defend against a reorg would be to hard fork. In the event of a hard fork, which "Bitcoin" will exchanges and users follow? The one that has never forked, or the one that has?

There is already non-negligible support for BIP148. You are voting in favor of risking a chain split to prove that there isn't enough support. That is your right, but make no mistake that you are voting to risk having the legacy chain reorganized into the chain with the stricter rules. This is what you are wagering. 
@_date: 2017-06-12 06:51:37
Call your favorite exchange and get them to publicly announce support for BIP148. The more companies that announce support, the likelier that we will have SegWit prior to its activation. Everyone wins and there is no chain split. 
@_date: 2017-06-07 11:58:47
Another way you can help is to demand that the exchanges support the activation of SegWit prior to August 1. If SegWit is activated before that day, then Bitcoin doubles the amount of transactions that we can fit in a block, allows for additional scaling solutions, and DOESN'T CAUSE A MESSY CHAIN SPLIT.

I think the best thing you can do right now, outside of storing your coins in a place where you control the keys, is email Coinbase and ask them if your Bitcoins will be safe if there happens to be a contentious chain split on August 1st.

Look at all of the newbies that Coinbase is signing up. Their servers can't handle the influx of new buyers. Look at how many hardware wallets are being sold. People aren't buying hardware wallets to day trade. They are waiting for the dips to buy more coins to put into storage for the long term. The day traders are quickly discovering how limited the supply of Bitcoin is, and the HODLERs keep taking coins off the market.

BIP148 is like Bitcoin itself in this way. The major governments of the world, and the economic majority, are largely ignoring Bitcoin - the market cap is teeny tiny and there are not many users. Do you think it is a better idea for them to continue to ignore Bitcoin, or to adopt it before it has the potential to cause major disruption? In this scenario, I am voting to adopt Bitcoin to protect myself from major disruption.
@_date: 2017-06-14 07:39:40
Seems like a lot of potential for neither to happen. I'm going with BIP148 to ensure that scaling happens to the original Blockchain on August 1 at the latest. 
@_date: 2017-06-28 06:35:56
Bitcoin is an opt in currency and all government currencies are mandated, giving fiat currency an instant user base of the number of citizens in a country. Bitcoin has grown to this size from 1 person in 2008, and still only a small minority of people use it (although adoption is growing). As the user base increases, volatility decreases since there is a fixed supply of 21 million bitcoins. It's much less volatile already than it was 5 years ago because adoption is much higher.
@_date: 2017-06-14 06:46:56
Bitmain, I recommend forking off prior to August 1. Why not today? No reason to wait. First mover advantage, right? You can catch those UASFers off-guard. I'm ready to be proven wrong that users don't find your hash power the most valuable aspect of Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-06-07 08:40:21
Miners, developers, and users all have an equal say on what Bitcoin is. I will be shocked if exchanges would willingly support a scenario that is programmatically guaranteed to cause a chain split, and that already has a non-negligible amount of support. 
@_date: 2017-06-19 16:43:49
Signaling for SegWit2x is a great way for miners to pretend that they are going to activate SegWit while not actually doing anything helpful. I will happily applaud miners that activate SegWit, but until that happens, I'm going to keep my BIP148 node running and transacting, and keep supporting companies that support BIP148, like bitonic.nl and trezor.

@_date: 2017-06-11 11:03:25
Bitcoin doesn't give a fuck about people signing agreements. Bitcoin is pure market forces backed by superb code and hash power. The safest scaling code already exists and it's called SegWit. 30% of miners would like to mine segwit blocks today, but they are being prevented from doing so. If the other miners want to avoid causing a chain split on August 1, their new decision is to activate SegWit before then or risk their newly created coins based on deprecated rules from being destroyed by a chain reorg.

Individuals benefit from deflation because their purchasing power increases as prices around them for goods and services decrease. It's not great for expansionary governments or companies who are not competitive. Bitcoin is happening though, so I guess we'll see how it all plays out.

My guess is that by 2140, the entire world will use bitcoin exclusively as its currency. At that point, 51% attacking it would be shooting oneself in the foot and unlikely because every home will come with mining chips as a standard utility to offset all of the excess renewable energy that's produced.

Governments that are laying foundation for their population to become early adopters of Bitcoin are going to reap the most benefit when the traditional financial system collapses (again). During the next collapse, their citizens are going to flock to the Bitcoin network and come out of it stronger and wealthier than ever before. Governments that are focused on giving their citizens a technological edge in cryptocurrency (Japan, Switzerland, India) vs trying to make it more difficult to adopt (USA, EU) will succeed in the new Bitcoin powered global economy. 
@_date: 2017-06-11 11:19:13
I agree. UASF is not safe. The safest way to get around it is to activate SegWit prior to August 1 using the code that has been tested to death. This is why I believe SegWit will be activated prior to August 1.

There is a non zero chance that cryptocurrencies will replace all Fiat currencies. What would need to happen is for a country of medium size and economy with passionate geopolitical opponents to adopt it as their default currency. That would, in my opinion, be the catalyst for replacing most, if not all Fiat currencies. This could happen if the next global financial crisis is damaging enough. Right now, Bitcoin is a life raft for people in Venezuela. It could become the world's life raft.

I think that she is downplaying how competitive people are for scarce resources. If the US government sees that Russia/China are deregulating Bitcoin, which could give those countries a massive competitive advantage if Bitcoin catches on, do you think they would still move to control it, even knowing that it could cause the US to become impoverished and Russia/China to become more powerful?  Once Bitcoin becomes big enough, governments will have to adopt it or risk being overthrown by citizens demanding to participate in the global economy.

And there it is. As an ethereum investor, you are economically incentivized to prevent Bitcoin from scaling. I understand that, but just know that preventing Bitcoin from scaling is bad for all cryptocurrency. Also, just be careful with your altcoin investments when Bitcoin gets SegWit because we will likely see money flocking back to the original, immutable blockchain.

As a user, your vote is equally important. It is users, miners, and developers working together that make Bitcoin valuable. You can hash numbers all you want, but if nobody cares or provides quality dev for your hashes, are you providing any value? If you are not a SegWit supporting user at this point, unfortunately now you are voting for a chain split. I didn't create or endorse this scenario, I am merely highlighting the 2 outcomes. Either we support SegWit now and get it activated before August 1, or there will be a chain split. Period. I support SegWit and cannot risk my wealth on a damaging chain split.

Any chance this is a strategy to lower the mining difficulty prior to August 1 to make attacking the BIP148 chain easier for Bitmain? I could see a surprise increase in hash power on August 1 being used to both boost the hash on the legacy chain and 51% attack the BIP148 chain, or am I just being paranoid?

I think you're wrong about a guaranteed chain split. A chain split is guaranteed to be avoided if SegWit is activated before August 1. Not voting immediately for segWit is therefore a vote for a chain split. It's that simple.

The software on the legacy chain no longer has any guarantee to "work as-is" after August 1. That is a guarantee that only the BIP148 crowd can make, since there is no risk of a reorg on their chain. There is a risk of slow transactions until the difficulty is reset, but not a risk of the blockchain being completely wiped out. If the legacy crowd wants to guarantee that their software will work as is, they must change the rules and hard-fork. Is a hard fork still Bitcoin at that point or something else? 
@_date: 2017-06-20 13:17:34
Great news that a vast majority of miners now support SegWit! Let's add BIP148 to Bitcoin Core as an optional switch for the users who would like to see SegWit activated as well! Core devs have done a great job creating SegWit, and now we will finally be able to see it in action on August 1.

It's not wussying out for miners to not signal support. Not showing support is a vote to split the Bitcoin blockchain. It is incredibly frustrating and annoying that this is now the case (damn you BIP148, you slippery bastard), but there is nothing we can do to change that this will happen August 1 unless we activate SegWit before then. That is the entire point of this post. Nobody can ignore BIP148 at this point and claim neutrality. If you are not voting for SegWit now, you are voting for a chain split (which is your right). This is a unique scenario precisely because SegWit is a soft fork that a significant portion of the population wants. 
@_date: 2017-06-14 13:14:07
You must be fun at parties! You are right, BIP148 as written does not literally activate SegWit on or before August 1. However, If miners want to avoid the risk of a chain split or losing their freshly minted coins, they will likely activate SegWit before August 1 (in which case BIP148 doesn't even get used), or after August 1 in order to stay on the original Blockchain with the stricter rule set. Therefore, you could say that BIP148's existence will cause SegWit to activate on or before August 1. 
@_date: 2017-06-11 10:23:10
Why would they start signaling for this in late July? SegWit will likely already be adopted by then. 
@_date: 2017-06-14 07:37:26
I agree. Bitmain, the largest manufacturer of ASICs and strongest opponent of SegWit just announced that they are planning a hard fork around this time to create their Altcoin, so I think it now makes sense for users to have an easy way to ensure the activation SegWit once they are gone, since SegWit will no longer be a contentious issue. 
@_date: 2017-06-25 10:25:43
The biggest economic risk of hard forking falls to the miners. I say let them hard fork. I'm not installing their new client , and I'll sell any coins that I have on a forked chain. Win win for me, and Bitcoin will survive either way. 
@_date: 2017-06-04 07:32:18

@_date: 2017-06-19 19:58:19
This isn't quite right. BIP148 requires miners to signal for SegWit by August 1, or else the miners new blocks will not be accepted as valid. Miners can still choose whether or not they want to mine SegWit blocks after August 1, but those that don't want to mine SegWit will no longer be able to prevent those that do from using the upgrade. 
@_date: 2017-06-04 10:20:05
I appreciate your grammatical edit. Your other point, while true, does not change the decision that miners need to make. Miners have to choose before August 1 whether or not they want to split Bitcoin. Not signaling SegWit before August 1 is a choice to split the chain. I am not a BIP148 supporter necessarily; I strongly support the avoidance of a chain split. BIP148 is out there, so now this is the decision.
@_date: 2017-06-07 08:52:28
My wager is that the market wants Bitcoin to scale immediately and will support the soft fork version of Bitcoin that is most likely to scale quicker. I wager that the market does not want a chain split or a hard fork.
