Not on this sensor.  Way more advanced.

As in anything digital.  Back it up and lock it up.  This card is designed for portability and a real computing digital wallet that interfaces with today's point of sale "POS" machines.  This married with Bitcoin is the nightmare scenario for the payment card monopolies. A better technology platform on all fronts that will displace them.  Or lets be more frank.  Will bury them.

Completely different sensor technology that of Apple.  Lifting a fingerprint and placing on a sensor won't work.  It is far safer than a PIN.  This replaces PIN's.  Card uses EMV chip card as payments terminal interface.  So it is inter-operative with standard chip &amp; pin terminals around the world.  Can be issued with up to 128GB of memory.  Way more than what is needed for the complete blockchain.  Has an internal ARM processor so it can perform in card computations.  This gives it stunning capability way beyond a static payments card.  The biometrics is military strength and way more secure than anything else in the payments arena.  It will be an intelligent biometric protected payments card with interface to existing Point Of Sale machines used around the world and now coming to the USA.  Look up EMV Visa for background on EMV if you live in the US and are not familiar with this technology.  The EMV interface chip in the SmartMetric biometric EMV payments card is always in an off state and is only turned on after a confirmed fingerprint match.  This again is a way more secure card platform than your dumb as tic alternative.
