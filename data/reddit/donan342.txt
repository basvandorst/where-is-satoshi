Everything you have done so far is completely insecure. Read this post I found for some pointers.

This has happened to me, you can read my story here in this thread. 
I have actually received a response from coinbase customer support, but there is no promise of actually honoring my original transaction, of which you can see here. 
Here is the response from customer support. 
"Rees replied:
Hi, sorry for the confusion on that. It looks like your transaction was canceled due to appearing high risk, and a refund has been sent to your bank account.
I know it must be frustrating to have this happen, but it's an unfortunate necessity that we exercise caution when selling bitcoin online in order to protect ourselves and the bitcoin community from fraudulent transactions. If you would like to try purchasing again in a few weeks you may have better luck then, but we can't guarantee the sale of bitcoin to every account due to the high risk nature of selling them online. Thank you for bearing with us as we work to improve our service.

This happened to me when I purchased 1 bitcoin.
My post is linked here: 
I have had no contact with any coinbase customer support so far. Disgusted.

I wish I had the same customer service rep that you had.

Windows and Ubuntu will do the same thing, however Ubuntu is prefered because it is open source. If you have a good grasp on technology in general, you should have no trouble following this guide on creating a bootable Ubuntu thumb drive. If you are paranoid, it is worth it to take the extra effort to install Ubuntu.

Is this why people's orders kept getting canceled?
