New news on the blog. 
Follow the construction of the block explorer almost there but finding all available to most browsers available transaction. 
The advantage is that is ordered alphabetically so we do not go crazy when looking at a coin. 
I hope this finished soon. 
Forgive my insistence but if you think the blog is useful, I would ask to maximize the dissemination and if you think it appropriate to keep the work day. 
Remember that it takes time and dedication and all contributions are welcome, taking advantage of this moment to thank whatever, des selfishly, have contributed to the maintenance. 
Thanks to all
