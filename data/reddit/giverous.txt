At this exact moment, an extra $500 would actually change a lot of things for me for the better.

Did you hear about the issues with its last incarnation? Not only do you need to cover your ip every time you interact with the site, you should also use a delivery address that is NOWHERE NEAR your home.  Last time people were caught because a mod was arrested and they took his credentials for the site.
There is literally nothing you can do to be 100% sure you're not talking to the wrong person.  All you can do is play it as safe as possible :/
Good luck.

Your biggest worry was the requesting of your IP from the exchange in question - that worry is eliminated with a VPN.  As long as you're using a decent service with shared exit IPs and no logging, you're golden.
@_date: 2014-05-20 11:03:21
and how about having no accountability? You're working with an unregulated currency, on a site which declines to list its origins or owners/operators, and trusting them with hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of currency.  Then people complain when it all goes belly up.
@_date: 2014-05-21 00:12:05
Or you could use a more transparent exchange and use a VPN.

For me it's about credibility.  This is an idea that i've been working on solo for 6 months, and it's kinda my baby.  I don't want to risk ANY credibility by offering an unbacked method of funding.
It's difficult to explain, but i MYSELF feel a little uncomfortable taking pledges in a format which doesn't afford the consumer certain levels of protection. Does that make sense?
@_date: 2014-01-08 20:20:59
I feel you man.  I get a bit funny if a member of my own family uses my phone or PC.  It's not even like theres anything I want to hide.  I just plain don't like it.

For a moment I thought you were trolling, then I read this comment.  It was so incredibly stupid that I actually lost intelligence reading it.

Malwarebytes is one of the best malware removal tools in existence.
@_date: 2014-03-19 02:26:30
But in formulating that insult you fail to take into account genetic variability and subjective intelligence.
Seriously though, you need to re-evaluate.  Trolling seems a little above you at the moment.  I'd recommend you try playing with blocks? Maybe confine yourself to a sub like the LoL community? I think you'll fit right in.
@_date: 2014-02-26 16:24:49
Did I say the only place offering the service was the one site? I saw truely desperate people go lower than 0.001 but as they were outliers I missed them from my post.
@_date: 2014-08-03 20:59:57
I do see your point, and in terms of bitcoin payment options at the moment the landscape looks pretty bleak.  To be honest, I hadn't heard any of the 'worse than mount gox' stuff, which is absurd.  It's overcharging for a service, not losing hundreds of millions of dollars worth of other peoples coins.
Personally I'd just find it hard to give them my money now, considering the level of the fuckup.
@_date: 2014-10-15 10:52:45
Yeah, he'd be more than justified going for 30k - he's had around 25k tied up for 11 months.  That money could have been earning a profit while invested elsewhere.
@_date: 2014-03-19 02:16:12
When you throw out an 'insult' do you just flick through the dictionary and stop at random?
And nope.  Success is managing to fail succeeding to fail failing at failure.
@_date: 2014-03-19 02:06:28
Nah.  I don't need to read any more to know that you're an unsuccessful troll.  How do you fail at failing?
@_date: 2014-01-03 05:03:33
You're safe as far as being traced because of the bitcoins goes.  There are other things to worry about though.  Are you aware of the safest ways to use a site like that?
@_date: 2014-02-26 16:41:51
My point was that if you had plenty of BTC laying around, it was worth a gamble in case they ever DID get the exchange up and running again. It allowed people with their entire fortune locked in Gox to liberate some actual value, whole offering a fun gamble for those with money to risk.  All good in my opinion.
@_date: 2014-03-09 13:25:24
wait, you mean people are using an exchange where no-one knows who is running it or if they have the funds to cover all of the user accounts? It's almost like people WANT to lose their money :(  I only have just over 1 BTC in BTC-e for this very reason.
Not that it'll matter much with my balance, but I'll withdraw on the 30th too.
@_date: 2014-03-19 01:52:10
Not really, I can spare it.  It's actually a little amusing that you really think you're right.
@_date: 2014-08-03 20:20:46
That was a very long and eloquent post, but in the end it's not strictly true.
You can't over promise to that degree.  You could maybe get away with a low estimate of fees, but there is no way that a well planned business goes into an endeavor like this without doing a bit of research.  To even CONSIDER partnering with a company like Visa you would surely give them a quick call and check out the situation?
How the hell do you go from no fees to that kind of pricing structure? There is no debit card in the world that I'm aware of that even comes CLOSE to those kinds of costs.  50p to check your balance? really?
One of two things have happened -
One, they knew there would be fees and were deliberately misleading about it, because they thought that they could keep the fees low enough to not piss people off too much.
Two, they didn't do their research and due diligence, leaving themselves completely unaware of the fact that the product they were proposing was impossible.
As weird as it sounds, I'd prefer option 1, at least they know what they are doing, rather than simply being incompetent.  I think the hate is completely justified considering the size of the fuckup and the level of misleading information released prior to the launch.
@_date: 2014-06-08 10:07:16
It's far worse than that.  A pool with a hashrate above 50% would be able to indefinitely delay transactions, double spend, mine all blocks and much more.
@_date: 2014-09-23 19:57:47
Now that sounds like a better idea, thanks very much.  At least if the Kickstarter goal has been reached, people know that there is a really decent chance that the product will actually materialize.
I knew posting in this sub would be a good idea :)
@_date: 2014-07-05 00:42:41
Everything being equal, it should be channeled directly into the budget of the departments responsible for busting the site.
@_date: 2014-05-22 03:22:40
And that's why you use a shared exit IP VPN.  Even if the VPN is forced to log, and even if they are forced to turn those logs over to the police, ALL that they have is a list of 50 or more people who might have been using that exit IP at that particular time.  Even US courts will throw out a crapshoot case like that.
@_date: 2014-03-06 19:45:05
We got this shit...
@_date: 2014-03-24 14:33:13
I don't get why this is such great news.  As far as I can tell from the linked post, all that has been confirmed is that they have reserves for a subset of their users.  What percentage of their total user balance is this?
@_date: 2014-02-26 16:13:23
Not really.  If Gox had reopened, even for a few months, people would have been able to extract the BTC and call it a day.  Considering I saw people selling full GoxBTC for less than 0.001, if I'd had a Gox account, I'd have probably spent a few tenths of a BTC on the off chance.
@_date: 2014-03-21 12:00:19

They are 64 million $ in debt, with around 38 million in assets.  They were never profitable as a company.
@_date: 2014-02-26 15:48:58
That wasn't so much stupidity as it was speculation.  There WAS a chance this would all be straightened out and the exchange would open again.  Considering how little people were paying for GoxBTC, I'd have considered it worth a small punt.
@_date: 2015-01-17 08:52:52
I disagree that this in unenforceable on Wall Street, and I honestly believe that they are right when they say that this will curb the activity of high-frequency traders that can destabilize markets.
I also agree that this will be entirely unenforceable on blockchain transactions.  I don't think this is one to worry about for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-05-01 12:28:19
That statement is kinda bogus, pretty much EVERY new technology is built on the 'hard work of others'.
The entire POINT of open source software is that you can fork the build and do whatever the hell you want with it.
Don't contribute to open source if this bothers you.

I seem to have inadvertently engaged you in conversation in two different threads that are now converging on the same point, so I'll simply post my last response here for you...
Obviously not, but maybe making a second post that is entirely dedicated to the discussion of an audit is in order?
To agree to every single Reddit request would obviously be foolish, however it appears that the idea of an audit is supported by a fair number of people.
If you have the discussion with a level headed and open minded attitude you may find that not only does the idea have considerable support, but there are more people than you realise willing to assist.
@_date: 2016-01-04 04:09:57
How convenient - an unproductive loudmouth wants something (**like someone asking for the communities help to save the foundation?**) and when the bluff is called and he is offered it the goalposts are moved (**like someone then saying they are not willing to put in the work required to utilise the help being offered?**)
The irony is strong in this post...
@_date: 2016-01-04 04:15:10
You may see it as unreasonable, but you're the one who opened this up for community suggestion and discussion.
Yes, people ARE asking you to put in some work on something you might not personally believe is the most prudent course of action, and that may not be anything to do with your own decisions.
If however your primary goal is the betterment and recovery of both the foundations financials and public image, sacrifices will have to be made.  Unfortunately your public request for suggestions means you will likely have to be the one making the sacrifice.  Is it fair? No.

@_date: 2016-01-04 04:06:36
Just because YOU think it is a waste of time doesn't mean it is.
You have stated that you want suggestions and that you want to help the recovery of the foundation.  If greater transparency and accountability will help people to trust the foundation again and maybe contribute on an ongoing basis, surely it is 'worth your time'?  Especially if people are offering time and resources to get the ball rolling.
Just spend a little time on repairing the foundations image within the community and take it from there.  It's not like you have a lot to lose right now...
@_date: 2016-01-04 04:41:22
I'll post the message i just sent you, sorry, I thought we were still in the threads, not messages ;)
Ok, I'll lay this out as clearly as I can, sometimes my writing gets a bit unfocused and the point gets fuzzy...
* The reputation and financials of the foundation are in the toilet.
* These two things are very likely connected - shady financials are NOT good for a foundation relying on membership dues
* You are asking for suggestions and ideas looking at getting things back on track
* The most overwhelmingly supported option that I can see is a full audit
At this point I'll break down my comments a bit to get to the nub of my suggestions...
* Firstly, a separate post dedicated to the idea and discussion of an audit would probably be worth the effort
* Directly asking for help and assistance with the process would also be a good idea in that post
* You are probably going to have to put in some work getting the information together that would be required for an audit
* Putting in the initial work in collecting the information will offer an incentive for other people to get involved and donate their time and resources - Set the example for others to follow
* You may find that you can garner a LOT more offers of help from the community if you engage and discuss, rather than biting back and smacking down ideas
* You may in fact find that the amount of effort you have to put into the audit is significantly less than you anticipate.
Look, the fact is that there are people in this community who WOULD be willing to assist you, I personally know a couple of financially minded individuals that would be willing to plough through the data and compile a report for free, as long as they have access to the information that they need. Seeing you put in the extra work and get this information together WILL inspire others to come to your aid, I promise.
You seem to think you're going to have to conduct the entire audit yourself, and that is NOT the case.

but the incredible volatility of bitcoin makes it a very risky investment.
If you invest in, for example, the S&amp;P 500 then you'd expect returns of roughly 5-10% per year.  If you use a snapshot of the early 80s to the early 2000s it would be around 12%.  However if you look at the early 2000s to mid 2016 it's only 3%.  Even given all of that, unless you are making some incredibly bad decisions it's VERY difficult to actually lose a substantial % of capital using traditional investments.
While bitcoin has had some incredible runs and made some people incredible amounts of money, it's unpredictability makes it a difficult choice for many.  Frankly comparing the two is absurd, it's like apples and oranges.
@_date: 2018-10-17 07:24:36
while that's true, those things actually NEED to use as much power as they do to achieve the goal.  With crypto the power usage is literally needless waste.

If yelp used to have the feature and then removed it, yeah, I would leave a negative review had I been using the feature.
@_date: 2018-10-25 16:58:01
I know that a lot of people don't apply that both ways, but that's why I was careful to list some pros and cons of both.  'Traditional' investing still has a very important place in the market for more stable and predictable though generally lower ROI than a 'good' bitcoin investment.
I would argue that there is literally no way to directly compare crypto investment and traditional investment in that way.  Crypto is far too new to be anywhere near stable, but represents an amazing potential technology and a savvy place to make a fortune if you read the market and the luck also falls on your side.
It's literally the wild west of investments right now and trying to predict the market requires equal amounts savvy and crystal ball.

To be honest, I think most of the poor rates are because the price is fluctuating so much.  They have to make sure their margins are large enough to absorb a hit if the price drops heavily.
Once things settle down, I would hope converting to/from different currencies would get easier and cheaper.  I guess it's the waiting game.  Not that I have enough to make it even close to worth worrying about.

Hold on just a second, I read that article days ago, and it's not Apple, but the NSA who are doing this.  The allegation is that they are intercepting phone shipments, filling them with malware, and sending them on to their destination.
It's essentially a real-world man in the middle attack.  I'm all for bagging on Apple, but in this case it's not their fault.

The rules about begging for bitcoin are set in stone.  They don't change every time the price of bitcoin fluctuates.  One rule for the 'good times' posts and another for the bad is wrong.
