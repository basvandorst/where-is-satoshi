If you have Bitcoin from before August that wasn't on an exchange then you have an equal amount of Bitcoin Cash.  
Bitcoin Cash you can currently trade it in for .25 ish BTC.  The easiest BTC you've ever made in the last 4 years.
Otherwise HODL/Buy.

Blaming lobbyist is just another conversation-stopping blame topic.  I don't deny the issue, but blaming lobbyists doesn't leave room to hear the other side's actual argument.
Gun control is a great example.  The idea that conservative politicians aren't looking for more Gun control is because of the NRA is really popular, yet truly ignorant.

Yeah I think the relationship between the perspective angle of the mouth is a bit off center meanwhile the rest of the face is near perfectly perpendicular to the "camera" as evidenced by the Tom Cruise tooth
Also the fine detail of the lips is contrasting the blurry, almost pixelated, features of the face which may or may not be intentional.

I'm not sure many people have ever achieved the results we're talking about by being healthy in a conventional sense.
