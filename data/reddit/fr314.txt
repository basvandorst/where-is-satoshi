I'd consider it.

That is AWESOME! Thanks that is so useful! I've never really played around with Bitcoins (although I'm fascinated by it), but this gives me one more reason to support it and support other people with it.
Right, time to use Changetip...

I don't know how to send coins, and neither do I have any (yet). As you can tell, I'm pretty lost here.

No worries, thanks for your help anyway! :)

Oh thanks soooo much! :) I've just requested an invite for circle.com, fingers crossed!

Coinbase won't let me add funds to my wallet, which means that Changetip won't let me "tip" anyone since I need to have enough funds in my wallet.

May I just say, you're pretty f*****g awesome!!!! Thanks so much for the tip, I really appreciate it! I was going to transfer some funds to help out a few people from [this thread]( so please rest assured that the $25.00 will go to good use! Thanks again, I really appreciate it!

It's supposed to be pretty easy, you can cash in via Coinbase. Unfortunately, it's only difficult when you're outside of the US - I'm in the UK and setting up an account and transferring funds isn't that straightforward - I've signed up to 5 bitcoin services in the past hour, no luck unfortunately.

I'm genuinely curious, and I'd genuinely love to help - how does Changetip work?
