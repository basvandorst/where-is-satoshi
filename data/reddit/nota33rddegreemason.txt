I was buying a lot then too, it was just the combination of it being down 80-84% and touching the 200 week ma( a historically good time to buy) and being in an ascending triangle, I always buy when I see an ascending triangle the bigger the better

I never have a problem with chase bank, I don’t deposit that much at a time though

I like Tim Drapers predictions, 250k by 2022, would be amazing to see
@_date: 2018-09-10 21:46:55
This is great, less reliance on tether in case tether implodes there is a backup, I’m sure the twins will pump bitcoin through this coin for the next bulk market

No coiner

To the right
@_date: 2018-09-22 19:25:26
It will be pretty stable growth until we pass 20k then we will go parabolic is what I’m thinking
@_date: 2018-09-23 09:03:37
It’s still early, the average person still finds this stuff so confusing, when everything is easier and faster then that’s when everyone gets in, can’t wait for lightning

Don’t do it again

250k by 2022-Tim Draper
@_date: 2018-09-23 08:56:13
Thanks for the responses, I have decided to split up funds between the paper wallets and a trezor, I’ll just have to take the risk of sweeping the paper wallets when the time comes
@_date: 2018-09-22 19:29:20
Well he was right about his 10k prediction back in 2014, no reason to doubt this one 
@_date: 2018-09-23 22:53:49
Exactly my thoughts, people who think we are going to 30k this year, and people who think we are going to 2k are both wrong
@_date: 2018-08-27 04:21:33
James richman has the same prediction as me of 47k so I will go with his
@_date: 2018-09-22 23:53:54
This is great but we need to keep bitcoin away from being associated with one political party, we need everyone using it

And this guy wants to be my latex salesman, I don’t think so.

There is also a bitcoin address with roughly 1 million coins that have never been sold, might be his, considering he is gone now

Listen to Trace Mayer and Andreas antonopolus

Coinbase pro is way better than Coinbase, no holds.
@_date: 2018-10-02 07:01:55
Buy a trezor or ledger, buy on Coinbase, send coins to hardware wallet
@_date: 2018-10-17 04:25:15
@_date: 2018-10-09 21:36:45
 It’s sound better for the general public
@_date: 2018-10-07 00:32:20
It is a good time to buy if you want to HODL, it will pay off big time in the coming years
@_date: 2018-10-29 04:39:31
I have auto buys ever two weeks and cash on the side if it drops low
@_date: 2018-10-01 01:58:49
Use Coinbase pro, it’s instant
@_date: 2018-10-02 00:48:38
only 6 digits? you gotta pump those numbers up, those are rookie numbers
@_date: 2018-10-07 02:12:26
@_date: 2018-11-27 20:44:01
Save yourself some pain and consider all news on bitcoin fake, it will all be retracted to dump the price more, fyi I’m bearish short term
@_date: 2018-11-27 20:40:55
I don’t believe any news regarding crypto unless it is technical news from the devs themselves
@_date: 2018-11-15 03:48:53
I can’t wait for the Flavortown ICO

Tim Draper said 2022 not 2020

USD is so expensive right now, I don’t feel like spending my Bitcoin right now.
@_date: 2018-11-03 02:19:05
Lol don’t be greedy

You won’t want to sell until 2021

That narrative is dead(good thing in my opinion) bitcoin is just as volatile as it was 4 years ago
