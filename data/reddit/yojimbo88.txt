Tell me about it, my productivity is dropping as fast as BTC is rising.

Got out of btc at about 19000, don't think I'm going back. Feeling higher returns elsewhere.

Bitcoins on par with my salary, but I don't have much invested, got in about a week ago. All I want is easy money to pay off my truck, at this rate I will be in a few months. But if it all goes to shit, nothing will really change.
I mean bitcoin would need to reach 300k to pay it off before taxes. But this community would need to continue to live on the HODL meme for a while for that to happen.
Will it? Who knows, I got in because its fun to be a part of it and if I make some extra money, great. Sadly I grabbed some ether and litecoin thinking they would follow bitcoin. Probably should have just got more BTC instead..

Just hit 10 bucks so I can become a whale, after that it can either go to 0 or to the next moon.

Tempted to sell it all in the Hope's of a total bloodfest market for the rest of the year and buy in later. Knowing my luck...we would moon tommorow. Maybe just 25% of my investment..the shot coins I fomoed in at least.
Decisions decisions.

As a federal employee, I have a better chance at becoming president than switching out fiat. Now if LTC can just keep going down, people freak out, and red candles appear. That would be great.

I would appreciate a massive red candle. I would like to double my bag if we can drop hard enough.

You might be right or you might be wrong. Only time will tell, but I have been watching prices closely now. I mean we all know at some point, money will flood in. We just don't know what that price will be. I would love a bull run that blows last year away, but I have accepted that it might never reach those prices, in my lifetime at least.

Sold a while ago and just watching the market burn, hoping it continues to bleed. Have a few numbers in my head on when to buy back in. But glad as hell I sold, feel like OP could have waited a little longer. I'm sure 3k resistance will fall just like all the others. Or it could go to 0, which would be a bummer.

With every fiber in my body, I pray that you're right. Because I am ready for a new all time high. But a continued price drop for now is great for some crazy gains later.
