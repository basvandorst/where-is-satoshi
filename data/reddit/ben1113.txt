The bitcoin cash comment seems to be kind of dumb, I use cash preferably for transactions when/where accepted. It's different than bitcoin, the blockchain could get large with the block size, but saying its failed would make me stop listening to the professor because it really lacks any reasoning. 
Seems like a typical he said she said stupid fight between bitcoin fans and bcash truthers, why bother they are different, they can serve different purposes.

Having 200btc makes you a whale. Being a whale doesn't mean you can't be an idiot and roll the dice in some super irresponsible ways, but why does the fact that he lost his money make him not a Whale? Whale = invincible? 
200btc, or 2mil+... makes you a whale. 
The advice about not day trading or not trading at all is also something that people need to figure out on their own. Crypto is all about having your own responsibility to your money, there is no broker or bank to tell you, hey did you mean to spend that 400k$? It's ultimate free market (for now...). there are plenty of people that do very well day trading crypto, they have great emotional control and do a lot of work. This story is about a person with a gambling issue, it is certainly sad, but one person doesn't invalidate an entire market or the ability for other people to be able to do something.

^^ some common sense showing up in Reddit huh? 
There are 3 data comparisons here, not each point. Each point is just saying the price at a time, if you put all the points into a data set, it would make no sense. 
this comparison is showing 3 data sets (sample of 3) that are made up of each of all the points. If you want to say the sample is all of the points individually then remove the 3-4 graphs and have 1 single graph with all data points irrelevant to their original data set.

And how do you distinguish between blocks and bars?

First why is this bad? If the bots are poor players, then let's go. Also you say it would be you plus 9 bots, so we assume one single human wants to play and the rest are bots? Just seems silly. I don't know why this would be far and away more likely to attract bots than current online poker rooms.

Yeah I think it does have SOME small amount of use, for example, it will take more money to move the price, normally, at a 200b market cap than a 100b market cap, right? Obviously if everyone wanted to sell at the exact same moment, it's not worth 100b or 200b or w/e, but that is the same as a company equity or stock. 
Both are still very 'real' and I do think it's still a useful thing, but agree that comparing the actual values of the two (btc//apple,Exxon,companies) isn't accomplishing anything.

Gemini is my favorite fiat/crypto for this reason. While you can't send crypto off exchange instantly, they do allow you to immediately use ACH to buy btc/Eth and now Zcash. So you can use btc stored for a transactions and backfill with fiat to btc on Gemini.

Etch with a UV active additive? So no need to break a hammer trying to impact the surface and if someone looks at it, you can know with an indicator. Plenty of UV active resin additives out there.

This is the case with literally everything in the world. People do go to jail completely innocent, people end up in the wrong place at the wrong time. This is by far a +value move for the site, the industry and the customers of Binance. I agree it could be a scary scenario but unless a better more valuable solution is suggested, it's kind of pointless to worry about this smallllll fraction of a chance something could go wrong when the inverse frequency is Binance cleaning up a huge mess.

Vit worked on Eth because it is a much different project. This post was about a somewhat funny (and certainly demeaning) moment for Ver, YOU are the one intentionally trying to label Vitalik as a money grabber when regardless of what you think, he has done so much for crypto overall. 
Also, when you use these puppies right here ", you should stick to actually what people say, not what "Satoshi pretty much" know what I mean?

I think that the point was being made that a significant part of bitcoins system is a set circulating supply. Paper contracts (while there are arb spots that help to balance money) don't physically own a bitcoin. 
By buying actual bitcoin, you reduce circ supply which is real value if we beleive bitcoin has value. Buying a paper contract doesn't (itself, again arb is real, others in this subreddit can explain it better than I) actually influence scarcity so isn't valuable to the system even if we assume the system (bitcoin) has value.

But what if you hodl through btc = 19k or if you used btc at btc =19k to buy a mining contract?? 
I think mining wins in this scenario (it can hedge against a bear market slightly better than hodl). 
I agree cloud isn't the way to go, but why only look at a situation when the asset increases in value?

How can it have increased anon as time goes on? The transactions that started as non anon cannot flip to anon they are already exposed.

So it looks like an internet survey so we have weight this more towards frequency internet users. 
Also keep in mind that we all live in our own bubbles. I know it's far from truth but of the people of regularly interact with, it's well over 50% that own crypto. Some because they invested with me, some for their own work/interest, some actually just stumbled upon it without even knowing I also was involved. 
I know the experience I have with other people's involvement in crypto is not the norm, but I don't know if I would largely doubt a few % of Adult Americans have crypto.

Yeah it's bit a direct link as you said, one can google bitcoin and never participate or they can rather ask a friend who is involved and never google it but they do participate. Not mutually exclusive, but I would say that magnitude of drop off seems a bit worrying. 
It doesn't make sense to link google trends with price directly but google trends being correlated with new interest seems fair.
