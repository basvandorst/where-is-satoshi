Sold at 0.11 but wasn't luck, just persistence in figuring out how to off load that BCH shite!

Yes, according to the 2017 price almanac obtained during the hack on the Bitcoin management offices in 2014, there will be a steady drop from $4342.55498374 on the 14th August to $1898.4888345 on 23rd.
The volume will be low at the lowest price so you will need to set your buys higher than that.
Later in the evening of the 23rd August, the price will jump back to $2459.39874658 and will then steadily rise to $6602.57600001 on 25th November, before a small drop as people start the Christmas-Cash-Out to buy presents.

I slowly threw €9.50 in 20 cent coins at the face of a a tramp.  Sure he got a bit blotchy and some reddness but he should be grateful because I'm such a good person. He owed me 10cents by the end but still...
BTW, did I tell you that I'm a good person because I made money by doing nothing and then gave it away?  
Did I tell you that you should be a good person like me?  I know there's starving kids but... well CATS! coz, Reddit! 
PS, you know I'm a good person right?
