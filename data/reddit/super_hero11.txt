@_date: 2019-12-19 07:54:07
What about Skrill or E-pay? CoinDeal accepts these two. Skrill is quite similar to PayPal, I always use it as my payment option on CoinDeal. To be honest, I don't know any cryptocurrency exchange where you can pay with PayPal.
@_date: 2019-12-24 11:19:03
What about CoinDeal? Its verification process is pretty quick and simple so I think that you will be satisfied. Fees are pretty low, it is available in US in 13 states. Deposits in USD currencies are free of charge.
@_date: 2019-12-18 09:02:45
I think that he was trying to say that Coinbase isn't proper for newbies because it's quite complicated and non-intuitive exchange. At least in my opinion. 
If you are from EU - I recommend you to check CoinDeal, because it's definitely one of the most "profitable" platforms right now. Fees are pretty attractive and deposits in some currencies are free of charge.

Lower fees are on CoinDeal or Kraken, that's for sure. I recommend you especially the second one now, because it has deposits in some currencies free of charge. Trading or just buying cryptocurrencies there is very profitable nowadays.
@_date: 2019-12-12 09:06:47
Recently I've been using CoinDeal's app and it works pretty fine. In general, everything works quickly there, it doesn't matter if you use CoinDeal traditional website or their app. Fees are great, this platform is even better than CashApp or CoinBase in my opinion :)

@_date: 2019-12-30 19:24:14
The purchase/sell circumstances are different on every exchange and it depends on internal payment processor of a certain platform i think. Even though it must've been really annoying for you :&gt; . Never had such problems on coindeal, the verification process took only a while, it's really user-friendly place to trade. If you have an exchange which has some issue with payments it's always good to contact their support first, they've might be working on something already.
@_date: 2019-12-09 06:27:20
Well, CashApp could be pretty problematic sometimes. This is why I've been using CoinDeal's app recently, I recommend it to you. Especially because they have deposits in some currencies free of charge.

Coinbase is okay, but there are also many better crypto exchanges, like for example CoinDeal where fees are pretty low. Deposits in USD, EUR and some other currencies are completely free of charge. I consider it as a safe exchange, because it has (among others)  Swiss VQF license which is pretty impressive.
@_date: 2019-12-05 10:38:48
On the website  [ you can buy Bitcoin with credit or debit card so it should be perfect for you. Quite basic website for all traders, that's for sure. It's pobably the fastest way of buying btc.
@_date: 2019-12-12 08:56:50
Maybe CoinDeal? Their fees are attractive, pretty low if you want to compare them to others crypto exchanges. There is one extra issue: deposits in some currencies are free of charge. So this is profitable for users. If you have some CDL Tokens, these coins could also lower your fees.
@_date: 2019-12-05 10:53:04
I recommend you to wait with cryptocurrency investments till you are minor. If you want to buy now, ask an adult for help, you just need to have an ID if you want to buy bitcoin safely. Every reliable cryptocurrency exchange like for example CoinDeal requires an ID. That's a standard, normal procedure.
@_date: 2019-05-09 10:09:47
Yes. There's always the right time to invest in Bitcoin. But of course, it also depends on you, what is your financial state right now. The ascertainment "the best time to invest" doesn't exist but it's always the right time.
@_date: 2019-05-08 10:36:11
I think  there isn't any best time to invest in BTC, you can predict how much it would grow or how low it would fall but the best moment acctually doesn't exist. But it's always a good time to start investing and playing with it. Maybe 2 months ago was better time to earn some money with bitcoin than it is now but it's only the matter of time.
