I understand this in general, I'm asking if I can (for lack of a better term) set a "range" I want to stay within, and sell it all if it goes too low or cash out if it reaches a certain high. I can do one or the other, but I'm wondering if there is a way to set a low and a high on the same funds.

If they can truly make electricity out of small amounts of heat, they should duct a load of S9's into the generator and make an endless loop of free juice!
@_date: 2018-01-26 04:29:40
Right, but I can only designate my finds to one - the high or the low - not both. That's what I'm trying to do. Set a high AND a low on the same funds.

I'm kind of looking at alts right now just because I can afford some full coins. Almost as if I were getting into Bitcoin a few years ago. Buy them before they're too expensive to buy. Any alts I buy I'm totally going to hold. Win some lose some, but hopefully the gains will come. Totally speculative like Bitcoin was 4 or 5 years ago.

I keep  open in a browser window all day. The tab title updates on its own, so several times per hour while at my desk at work, I glance over and on occasion click to the tab to see how tall the walls are. It's an addiction, yes.

If it goes to $2k I might actually be in reach of owning 1 full bitcoin. Let it happen while I hodl till we hit $100k!

Not exactly:
I just click "buy bitcoin" and they start the process of pulling the money from my checking account. There is no money in my USD "wallet" at Coinbase. They just withdraw whatever I buy.
I'm not sure if I get the coins at the price when I click that buy button shown in the link here, or if I get them at the price when the money arrives to coinbase, which is a few days later.

I was wondering about this today. I'm a n00b, but in my reading I started seeing ads for these Ant Miners. The new S9, it *looks* like I could mine 1 bitcoin every 70 days or so. Doing rough math, not counting the price of the miner, it'll cost about $250 in electricity to mine 1 bitcoin. 
Surely it *can't* be that easy.
@_date: 2017-09-17 19:05:20
When you buy on coinbase and use ACH for payment, does your buy of coins occur at the price at the moment you placed the order, or at the price at the point they receive the funds from your bank a few days later?
@_date: 2017-09-20 02:03:24
You don't have to deposit money in the USD account on Coinbase if you tie your account to a debit card or checking account. I do it all the time. It takes a week for the coin to show up in my account, but the purchase is made at the rate when the buy occurs. It's an instant buy, but it does take time to reach your account.

Indeed I do. Thank you, browser history!

I'm still a bit confused.
On Coinbase, I click buy/sell, and the payment method is my checking account. Let's say at this moment, BTC is $3600. I get an email saying the coins will arrive in my account a few days later.
So a few days pass giving the ACH time to get the money out of my checking account. The money leaves my account, goes to coinbase, and Coinbase gives me my bitcoins. Let's say at the moment that happens, BTC is $4k.
Will I be getting the number of bitcoins I purchased when I first ordered (at $3.6k), or when I receive the coin in my wallet (at $4k)?

It didn't say you would travel back in time. It says "restart your life at 10 years old."
You could, according to this, become 10 years old, but it's still 2017.
Plus since I'm nearly 50, I'm going blue.

I, too, am a newbie. I did about 30 minutes of research and settled on Coinbase to venture in to crypto. I know there are a lot of techie guys who insist on other places like localbitcoin to get coins cheaply, but I just couldn't wrap my head around the technical side of things. Coinbase, on the other hand, was just like using Paypal. Super easy interface, and they made the process very, very easy for the average layperson. 
I saw an article that, for the first time, seemed credible that predicted BTC hitting $6k within a few months. Whether or not this is true remains to be seen, but I ventured in because I had some spare change to toy with. 
I'm about $300 into crypto now, roughly spread 1/3 each between Bitcoin, Etherium and Litecoin. 
Again, say what you will about Coinbase and their fees and such, but to me, it was worth paying their transaction fees for ease of use. 
Now, the more I learn, I'm getting a bit more educated and may soon move my coins from Coinbase into an Exodus wallet. But for now even if I don't, I'm not out much if BTC goes belly up. And if it does hit $6k like the article predicted, then woo! A nice dinner and hotel stay for the wife and I. 
At the moment for me, it's not an investment. It's more like a fun trip to a casino. Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose, and I never bet more than I'm prepared to lose. 
As a noob, it would be silly for me to think about investing anything more than play money. But the more educated I become, I may start to try to find more disposable income to contribute to what is essentially a new hobby for me.

Perhaps, but that wasn't specified. 
One cannot safely make the assumption that you'd instantly go back in time.

So, that's about $67 USD per month per node. 
And did I understand correctly you're putting multiple nodes on one computer?
So, let's say you have 10 nodes on one computer, mining around the clock. That's $670 per month from one PC.
My math must be wrong, or I'm misunderstanding. 
In any case, this does sound intriguing. I'd love to hear more.
