The Internet is an ancient technology(relative speaking) But is structured in a way that it allows new technology to enhance it. That is bitcoin. LN and other protocols will rocket Bitcoin into the future while Bcash sits back and yells "BUT BIGGER BLOCKS!"

what if by mining, its not the hardware doing the mining, but the player when doing in game tasks, when mining a resource \( say in wow, when you mine copper\) you actually get crypto copper that you can trade on exchanges

If you see the photos in the tweet, it says "paid and confirmed" but I guess that can't be true then....

This is one of the best things when it comes to bitcoin, all transactions are public! Therefore it is the most regulated and government friendly currency, while still making the users anonymous, when they are outside the searchlight of the government
