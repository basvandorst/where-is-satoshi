Wash trading is a big problem in crypto,  don't believe the numbers from exchanges.

Cold showers are bad for you.

Take this stuff with a grain of salt,  obviously trying to hype it up. 
Crypto is very young as an asset  class.
Bitcoin and other coins with real utility and use cases are going to take longer to appreciate above their previous highs (or to moon in the first place), than most people realize.

Yeah I have a pretty good cost of living,  and low living expenses,  I am usually able to save and invest roughly 50% of my take home pay.

You're going to get better roi for now from other cryptos. 
Bitcoin is slow, controlled by China and environmentally unfriendly,  it uses more electricity than entire countries.

Nothing of any significance. Just standard price movements.

Yeah i agree, i haven't even been to a casino.  Just play cards with friends. 
Buying stocks, forex trading and csc are how I "gamble" to get more money.  And i do it very well ��
@_date: 2019-10-26 07:17:04
Still have mine from the ipo ��
@_date: 2019-10-20 15:06:06
What's the benefit to this?
@_date: 2019-10-27 23:54:06
Plenty of ways to make money trading.
I do quite well with forex trading, i make more than my salary some months. 
Nothing is guaranteed. There is always risk.

Lots of bots and dead accounts are inflating the numbers of subreddits. 
They should just have people unsubscribe if they are inactive after a few months.

Most art over $50k is just used to launder money. 
Lots of insurance scams too, forge a painting,  have it "stolen " and collect the money. 
Lots of yachts are constantly traveling around the world within international waters and are refueled and restocked so they never have to dock.
Many filled with illegal drugs and items etc.
@_date: 2019-12-03 05:08:43
So many people are unable to see the truth.

You ever do forex trading? 
I used to do it before I got a new busier job and would make an extra $500 a month, or higher. 
But my goal was always to shoot for $100 a week. 
Sometimes it took an hour, some days you lose money. 
Practice account with oanda and read the book 'Naked forex '

Is it still a good place to take a vacation? Hotels still open to people? Tourism going well?

The wealthy live off their passive income streams in most cases.  
Once your net worth is over $10m,
 you're wasting time if you still work in almost every job.

Yeah but in my scenario if you are sitting on $2 million dollars or more invested into a diversified portfolio and asset classes,  putting that to work is able to provide plenty of money to live off of.
For instance,  I will be hopefully getting between $5-10 million in around 5-10 years.  I intend to get syndicate investment properties and increase my holdings across the board. 
My FDDI should be huge.
Minimum goal is getting it to over $100 a day average.
