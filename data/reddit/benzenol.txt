Don't think the community here is that generous. I made a post asking for some cents in bitcoin a few months ago when I was deciding whether to purchase or not, and many users downvoted me and told me that I was begging.
Anyways, I discovered the faucets shortly after and I'm a proud owner of many millisatoshi now.

We're talking about a million dollars here. This should be spare change. 
Or you could just send me the 1k BTC and we'll call it even.

I will. I want real life verification for the farm (surely you can afford a plane ticket).

I found your Arcade section, and I'll be playing games for the next 6 hours or so.
Thank you for making my day unproductive.

Do some split testing, in order to receive the most benefits without wasting money.
See which hours are the most active, try different wordings of the ad etc. If you're planning on continuing this ad campaign for a long time, then split testing will save you a lot of money in the long run.

I currently work both online and offline as a freelancer SEO consultant, but I would also like to expand in the Bitcoin market (which is a whole different market than the general online marketplaces).

Advertising this subreddit might put off some users, because they might not see the benefits of using bitcoin immediately from all these general posts.
One idea would be to write a detailed post about how you can make money with bitcoin (using those sites that pay you mBTC for captchas) and advertise it at microjobs subreddits (there were a few subreddits where users would do tasks for a few cents, can't recall them now).
Or create an informative post about Bitcoin as a currency, explaining all the history and benefits, and advertising it on financial subreddits. 
You should always add links on your posts though, so you'll still be advertising this subreddit.

You're giving me more games, plus access to WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS TO ME?! :(
(Thank you for the gold Thomas, and best of luck with Scirra).
