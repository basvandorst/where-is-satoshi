I'm just your garden variety idealist.  Have a nice day.

You are missing the point.  It's not about the individual, it's that most people use them like a bank.

That's nice for the person who does that, but how does that change the fact that most people will not use that feature?
The point isn't individual's can move their coins to a different address.  It's that if most don't and are lazy, coinbase's, circle's, and most exchanges design creates a "too big to fail" risk.  
You know their cold wallet balances are not insured, right?  You didn't fall for that marketing trickery, did you?  Read the fine print.
Coinbase and Circle =/ good for bitcoin.  They are big, poorly designed, and effectively uninsured and unregulated bitcoin banks.

Coinbase overstating their number of users by a factor of 10-20 doesn't mean the majority of people who do use them leave their coins there without enabling the multisig vault.  Those two things are not mutually exclusive.
You sure seem awfully defensive.  Do you work for Coinbase?

What you are appreciating is that there is a bank boycott in the US on competition other than coinbase and circle.  
Do you think it's hard to take bitcoin for cash?  What they are doing is technically no more challenging than selling shoes on amazon, and regulation is no more strict than opening a check cashing business.  
These companies are enjoying a monopoly courtesy of the fact that banks refuse to let anyone else open up business accounts to exchange cash for bitcoin.  Don't believe me?  Ask around.  Google it. 
That's not something to appreciate unless you are one of the people profiting from the corruption.  So again, do you have an interest in Coinbase?
