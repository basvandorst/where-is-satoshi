You superior thinking Aussies. Do you really think American banking is backwards compared to your country? LOL. yes, i am literally laughing out loud.
Of course American banks are winning. American bankers are the smartest people in America.
For many years the best and brightest Americans have greedily learned finance (instead of physics, or other helpful sciences).    
America is the supreme bank.    
You are ignorant (sorry).    
Also, I'm a patriotic Canadian, fwiw.
Good luck with your insane valuation of your goods and products and services. When i visited Australia i couldn't believe the insanity.
Also good luck with your impending housing crisis. Really, i wish you the best of luck. I look forward to the day when I can visit Bondi beach without the insane overhead of the Australian financial system.

nice outlook. It is not the convenience that makes btc the protocol of the future.
The reason that bitcoin, (or some variation of cryptocurrency, maybe bitcoin 2.0) is the future of financial transactions is...democracy. In the P2P sense.
It's decentralized, and no governing authority can apply arbitrary restrictions or governance.
That's why bitcoin will be the future
edit: democracy presupposes generosity and kindness- basic human goodness. Democracy means that the collective can influence the direction of the system. Anarchy means that individuals influence the direction of the system, but the individuals are selfish and self serving, and the system will devolve into chaos. I stand by my idealistic use of the unfortunately tainted word "Democracy"

Canadian here. Face it, the banking system crosses borders. You can't be nationalistic about banks

no. i use coinbase to get my BTC into a US account, and xe.com to transfer to other international banks via ACH/EFT. It's pretty cheap if you are transferring  between accounts you own, especially if the international banks have branches in the US...

Do you see what you're doing? You are speaking from above, acting superior. Why? Why do you feel justified to do so?
Figuratively, you're living in your parent's basement and feeling very important because you can throw around acronyms

I'm guessing Atlantis was started by a drug enthusiast. This kind of reaction, extreme but positive, is a clear sign of a serious psychedelic experience.
Doesn't matter much. There's SR, and it's a lucrative business, so competitors can come and go. I'm a bit bummed not to be able to spend mined LTC
