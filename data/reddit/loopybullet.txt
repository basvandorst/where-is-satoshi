As much as I think Roger is a douche, he brings up some pretty valid points. I don’t like that he shills BCH so often and that Bitcoin.com and that its wallet is pretty misleading, but he has a point.
If you want to use BTC as a store of value, fine. That’s how I use it. However, fast and cheap transactions are important, and adoption toward a greater vision of Bitcoin requires it to be flexible enough to be more than a store of value. If not, then I don’t see the point in developing the Lightning network. A store of value can also be fast. There’s no harm in that. That’s what we should be striving for. Why shouldn’t Bitcoin replace the remittance market by being light years ahead of what it is now? Why shouldn’t it make bankers sweat even more? Why shouldn’t BTC be as fast and cheap as BCH?
Good debate all around. No fingers flashed. I have mixed feelings about both sides. Roger and his shilling and exaggerated arguments (somewhat red-herringish things like BTC is not a “cryptocurrency” if not used as a currency). Jimmy and his arguments that many people who use BTC as a store of value think it’s just fine (true, but there is always room for improvement and “just fine” is NOT good enough - it’s ignoring the fact that scaling is a problem that needs to be solved).
I feel like Vitalik B’s view, as evidenced by his tirade of twitter posts addressing the 0.5T mkt cap yesterday, is the right vision for cryptos in general. Cryptos did not earn this. They are not scaled enough and not good enough to REALLY use mainstream. They did not seriously bank the unbanked or REALLY change the world enough yet. That needs to change ASAP, and it changes with realizing that there ARE problems and that they need to be addressed. A 100K mempool is unacceptable to me. Normies are flooding into the market and scaling will become a bigger and bigger problem with the kind of arguments Jimmy had in this video.
Even people who you don’t like can make good points. I think everyone should realize that. I would like to see BTC leave BCH in the dust as well. I just wish it was better. It’s hyped more than any other coin and is the grandfather of crypto, but it’s not miles ahead of the alts in terms of function, which is a shame.
I doubt anyone will read this whole thing, but I feel better after writing it. Maybe it’s more therapeutic for me than anything else. :)

More often than that, at first. Now it’s a few times a day...but I also realize that watching the price has a negative effect on my decisions. I would have more than twice my value if I just held and acted on nothing. FOMO &amp; FUD are often triggered by prices. You’ll hear quite a bit of stories in the same vein.

This is what it is for me on the "low" setting, unfortunately. I'm a bit scared to enter a lower fee and my transaction get stuck for way too long.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:04:43
I was one of the people who mentioned the high tx fees. It's actually true. I was trying to move money into Binance and had to double take. The mempool is immense right now, unfortunately. No fishiness from my end, just frustration, lol. This was using the Segwit wallet on my Ledger Nano S and the "Low" fee option.
@_date: 2017-12-14 01:20:03
I mean, the interviewer was a little bit of a douche as well. Just douche all around. Ver makes good points imo and I’m just as disappointed with the lack of scaling from BTC as anyone else, but his shilling is pretty over the top.
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:53:04
How long did it take for your transaction to get through?
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:27:39
When setting a custom fee, you can enter in satoshis/byte. No advanced settings for inputs/outputs. I don't believe there's a way to preview the unsigned transaction other than the information in this window as far as I know.
Regardless, I guess the question is more about whether or not the Ledger Nano S has coin control, which I don't believe it does. Maybe a more experienced user of the Ledger Nano S can chime in.
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:54:07
I know that you can edit the fee. Not looking to spend a LONGER amount of time to get my coins though. Thanks.
@_date: 2017-12-25 17:34:46
I thought it was that it would likely lead to non-consensus and this, a split in the currency. That happened with Bitcoin Cash, as far as I understand.
@_date: 2017-12-25 19:42:00
Generally, if you listen to Roger Ver, his opinion is that Bitcoin Cash is the “real” Bitcoin because it’s closest to Satoshi’s whitepaper. Also that block sizes were meant to be increased. Also that since Bitcoin Cash currently has faster transaction times and less fees, that people will realize this in time and go to Bitcoin Cash for the utility.
I disagree, and I think that Roger Ver often shills BCH for his own gain. Even if BCH is closest to Satoshi’s whitepaper, which can be argued, many feel that the original whitepaper is not law, but rather a prolific document of the time. Any industry that does not evolve once better ideas come along is not an industry that will grow to its full extent. Many feel that second layer solutions like the lightning network is the better choice. Some also feel that big blocks lend to centralization as it will be more of big league miners who will mine the coin. Both had advantages and disadvantages.
Utility of a coin now is valuable, but it’s not the end-all argument. There are coins much faster than BTC, as well as BCH. There are also coins that will slow down just as much if they had he same traffic as BTC. The endgame is what we want to worry about. Your choice. There’s some degree of market manipulation with every coin, but from a pure investor perspective, I just suspect that there is more manipulation when it comes to BCH. That turns me off as well.
Anyway, this is all opinion. I’m mostly a newbie as well, but that’s the situation as I see it. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 20:38:13
Thanks for your response, very helpful. I’m all for faster and cheaper (or free), but I’m hoping that eventually BTC’s developers can develop a system that does everything automatically. Almost zero thinking for the end users. For adoption, I feel that this is very important. Seems fairly simple and all, but still. I always think to myself that I hope that my mom (who asks me how to rename folders on her computer) will be able to use Bitcoin without asking me for help.
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:31:39
Please do. I joined in late October. Right now, the networks are unbelievable. It was a few dollars to sent BTC from my Ledger Nano S to anywhere at the time (which is still pretty expensive to me if the eventual goal is to use it for currency). Now it's quoting me between $80-$100 for one transaction at the moment. I'm guessing because there seems to be 206K unconfirmed transactions right now. Holy flipping what. Glad I have everything in Ether at the moment. Fees are higher than they should be on the Ethereum network but I thought the legends of $80 transaction fees were myths from r/BTC. Afraid not. This coming from someone who really does not like the propaganda coming from certain BCH shillers (though I'm impartial to block size tbh). $80 transaction fee is unacceptable, sorry. Please I hope hope hope that the network improves exponentially this upcoming year...and for the sake of not scaring away people who venture into the crypto space in 2018 as well.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:03:02
Well, Coinbase and GDAX added BCH, so that's pretty big news and a LOT more money that can flow into BCH now.
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:12:24
As far as I understand, the Ledger Nano S does not support coin control (unless I'm mistaken and Google has failed me. Or I've failed Google, haha). I'm currently using a Segwit address as well. Thanks for your input.
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:56:08
What about using a VPN or Tor? Hopefully tools like Substratum can alleviate this difficulty for Hawaii residents or others blocked from using exchanges.
@_date: 2017-11-04 20:06:35
Very cool. I told her definitely not to do it herself. I’m much more comfortable being the custodian of her money. She’s someone who calls me when she’s trying to figure out how to rename a folder on her computer. I don’t expect her to be able to figure out wallets, avoid high fees, keep private keys, be cautious about replay attacks, phishing, scams, scanning for keyloggers, let alone using an exchange!
@_date: 2017-11-06 14:46:22
Bitcoin itself is not a scam. However, there are scams in the bitcoin and cryptocurrency community (some exchanges where you buy bitcoin may be scams in the future, programs that let you “invest” your money and run off with it, etc.). I wouldn’t bother arguing with people who thing Bitcoin itself is a scam. :)
My suggestion is to watch some videos to get a better understanding first. Andreas Antonopoulis and Ivan the Programmer on YouTube have fantastic videos explaining Bitcoin. Yes, your $250 could be worth more in the future. Or it could be worth zero if the community collapses somehow. Invest only what you’re willing to lose.
Or you could keep your PS4 and buy a copy of Nier: Automata and have a fantastic time. I was a PS2 fan a long time ago but I played through this game and it was mind blowing! :)

Seems like the pump happened from 9am to 2:30pm China time.
I wonder if the only reason why they stopped was because bithumb went down.
@_date: 2017-11-15 09:44:47
Tin foil hat theory time.
I don't think that anything went away from the original plan that night. I believe that this was partly a warning, and partly to attract media attention around Bitcoin Cash. Bitcoin Cash's growth is NOT organic in my opinion. Whales/miners in SK or China are manipulating the price &gt;$1K, and this past weekend was obvious price manipulation from people with A LOT of BTC to throw around. Even now, there is BTC being injected into the market to maintain BCH's price.
Difficulty adjustment comes in about 10 days. BTC's difficulty will likely adjust upward, and with BCH's successful hard fork to address its difficulty issues done, it's a good time for something pretty bad to happen.
Regardless of how you stand on the situation, I think anyone with a brain can agree that there WAS an attack this weekend, and that if it persisted, a lot of people would've lost a lot of money. Also, the mempool would've fared a lot worse...and that run only lasted 6 hours. There have been attacks on Bitcoin in the past, but there are a lot of things lining up too perfectly lately for me to be comfortable.

I was speaking with a CPA in the US who has experience with cryptocurrencies because I was concerned about the same thing. He mentioned that in spite of our limited guidance from the IRS, transferring between cryptocurrencies is likely a taxable situation. Likely, a 1031 like-kind exchange is not available as a tool.
You may have a realized gain/loss without even converting into fiat, or possibly even a barter exchange, to my understanding.
I would speak with a CPA who has experience in cryptos if I were you. I’d hate to make money in cryptocurrencies only to have it taken away in back taxes plus interest.
@_date: 2017-11-08 23:03:51
Not in the US. I wouldn’t bother to in the US as the tax paperwork is fracking horrible if I were to buy anything. If the IRS sees it as an asset, I do too.
@_date: 2017-11-10 18:44:50
Yeah, I'm resisting the urge to panic sell/FOMO into Bitcoin Cash, which I assume is what a lot of people are doing now. Then THAT will dip and I'll be really in the red. hah. Or it won't and I'll slap myself.
Anyway, it does look like some alts I've been looking at are taking more of a percentage dip versus BTC, so it might be a good time to diversify now. VTC in particular is looking pretty good. I'm almost 100% in BTC right now.
@_date: 2017-11-10 17:34:14
So WTF is happening right now and why? Movement from BTC to Bitcoin Cash?
@_date: 2017-11-12 16:47:56
The pump lasted from 9am to 2:30pm China time. Maybe round 2 will be around the same?
@_date: 2017-11-10 17:40:15
Why is it dropping so much? Was it the Bitcoin Classic news? I'm very confused as a newbie right now. Bitcoin Classic is NOT the developer behind BTC right?
@_date: 2017-11-06 08:06:12
Does it matter if we move BTC from the wallet it was in when the snapshot happened?
@_date: 2017-11-07 00:22:31
Hodl. It'll go up. Then down again after the fork. Then slowly upward afterward. Or not, who knows. You're likely good. Mindfucks happen when you buy at ATH.
@_date: 2017-11-04 01:45:14
I told my mom I was investing a bit into these “new” digital currencies that have actually been around for about a decade. She said, “Oh you mean like Bitcoin?! One of my old friends did that and she’s trying to talk me into doing it too!” Good times.
@_date: 2017-11-06 05:40:24
A couple days.
@_date: 2017-11-13 00:54:20
Bravo. I just have a newbie question - if the attacks come in waves and the money/sell walls/etc. continue, how fast can BCH turn into the more profitable coin to mine? Overnight? Or more like days/weeks?
@_date: 2017-11-09 10:47:54
In the US? As far as I know, yes. They’re considered an asset by the IRS and thus can be taxed when you have realized capital gains. With the little guidance the IRS has put out, it seems that even trading crypto-to-crypto triggers a taxable event where you may need to pay capital gains tax as well even if you’re not being paid out in fiat. Reason being is that 1031 exchanges are likely not allowed (just as it isn’t allowed with stocks). Even using Bitcoin to pay for goods and services is technically taxed as capital gains if the value has risen since you’ve bought it. Ridiculous, I know, but it has to do with the fact that the IRS sees it as an asset. They are cracking down on it, as well. Just look at the news about Coinbase. Don’t take this as law though obviously, as I’m not a CPA. I would speak with a CPA about how to file your taxes actual advice.
@_date: 2017-11-09 06:36:23
Prediction are big swings over the next day or so, then a slow trend upward to 8k. I think alts will beat BTC over the next week though.
@_date: 2017-11-11 02:08:10
Not say how many but $5900USD a little while ago!
@_date: 2017-11-08 23:02:55
55 bitcoin in your wallet that you EARNED you didn’t buy.
@_date: 2017-11-10 18:17:02
I see. I'm fairly new obviously, and this is just the biggest plunge in price I've seen since I got in around $5900/BTC. Saw the article on CoinTelegraph about Bitcoin Classic throwing in the towel and got very confused as I thought it meant that BTC themselves were calling it quits. Then the price correction. Then shit my pants. hah.
@_date: 2017-11-15 00:13:47
It could be a fast death depending on what the major players want to do. 6 hours worth of pumping BTC to buy BCH this past weekend showed what can be done in a relatively short time period. Kind of scary.
BTC does have the Bitcoin name to it, but I think that is all its got comparing it to other cryptocurrencies (which is a whole lot, actually, if you look at straight market cap, haha).
Very vulnerable for being the  cryptocurrency.
@_date: 2018-02-08 00:48:08
I highly doubt that BTC will have that kind of overall dominance in crypto in 2018.
@_date: 2017-10-28 05:12:36
Is that a head underneath? Haha.
@_date: 2017-10-23 21:46:47
Nothing odd here.
@_date: 2017-10-24 04:58:57
I bought in at $5900 the other day. This is the beginning of my adventure into the crypto world. Tonight's dip after the gold fork is the first testing of my patience. Hodl, nonetheless. Looking toward the long-term.
@_date: 2018-02-08 05:53:19
What I mean is BTC dominance percentage wise compared with market cap of all of crypto. A $1T overall crypto market cap with BTC at $50K each would mean overall BTC dominance of ~85%. I could see either one happening - either BTC at $50K or a $1T overall crypto market cap, but not both simultaneously. If BTC is $50K, I’d anticipate the market cap for crypto to be much higher than $1T. If the overall market cap is actually $1T, I expect BTC price to be much lower than $50K.
@_date: 2017-10-24 03:18:50
Could you explain to me how the fork might not happen? Isn’t it inevitable that the fork will happen even if B2X is worth very little? (This is coming from a newbie, sry!)
@_date: 2017-10-25 14:39:33
Yeah I bought just under 5.9k actually. My bad! I don't think too much of it though. Buying more for the long run, and I do think it'll come up. Just slowly. Trying not to let it get to me, hah.
