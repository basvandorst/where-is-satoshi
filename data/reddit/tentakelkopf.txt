I get your point but bitcoin is only around for like 8 years, what does the age of the universe has to do with it?
@_date: 2018-05-24 13:30:16
Fair enough, but the bitcoin market hasn't been around that long ;)

Yes, I think so too. But I still wish I would have been smart enough to keep some for a little abit instead of spending it instantly. But yes, no way I would have hold till 10k

A year ago looked up what I spent on darknet weed in 2012-2014. Couldn't believe it. 
5 BTC. I remember the btc price was about 200$. Now that would be worth 40k, more money then I could dream of as a poor uni student. And it didn't even was that much weed, worst buys of my life. 
But instead of beeing bitter about it and wishing btc the death I researched more about it and finally I realized this is about so much more then just silkroad and money laundering. Then in last august I finally decided to buy some for hodling. It was really the best decision of my life.
Now I am so happy about those BTC I spent on weed because without that I might have never seen the potential. But it was hard to justify buying at 4k knowing that I wasted 0.5btc for 10g of weed some years ago. But I still bought 1 btc, planned to forget about it but the hype was to strong and so I have been trading alts, researching and looking out for ico's and undervalued coins pretty much all my freetime in the last half of 2017, I wanted to get back this 5 BTC.
And I did it, got lucky with a few ICO's and antshares, walton, stuff like that. The darknet experience made me paranoid of cashing out or buying anything with crypto tho.

It is really one of the worst exchangs out there! Don't get fooled by ads or there fake volume. Hijacking this comment thread to tell a story about HITBTC that is a bit different. Fortunatly I didn't loose any funds but it is the reason I don't use them anymore. 
So I bought in a ICO called cappasity back in November. Was a good investment and I decided to take some profits. Thats when I realized that deposit is disabled, I asked in Cappasity telegram and admins said they have contacted them about the issue but got no response, for a week now. Quite shitty if you consider the ICO team probably paid a lot to get listed, It was only 2 weeks before trading deposits were disabled without any reason or communication with the team (hitbtc probably bought a lot coins themselves and manipulated price by disabling deposit so only them can sell them).
So after like 10 days without any info and deposits beeing disabled the Cappasity team proceeded to warn people on their medium about the hitbtc situation and just transparently told their users and investors what they tried to solve the issue and that hitbtc just isn't responding. A few hours later, probably as a reaction to that medium post, hitbtc completly delisted the token without any warning and people who had the token couldn't even see or withdraw it for weeks, it hasn't be relisted since, but luckily, people could withdraw them. Also some very suspicious people joined the telegram around that tiome, only to fud the project and also make cappasity look like are responsible for the delisting because of the blogpost. 
TLDR: They take absurd amounts of money from ICOs to list their tokens and then disable deposit (to manipulate price?). They don't respond to the team they took money from and if the team makes that public they just delist the token without any notice. It's bullshit and they deserved to be sued
