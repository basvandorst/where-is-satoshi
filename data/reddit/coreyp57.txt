Google Translate:
"That Bitcoin is also used for all kinds of illegal business - albeit to a far lesser extent than US dollars or euros - is not just since the Silk Road process known. The course has called into action the international law enforcement agencies. Especially financial institutions such as banks are subject to this strict anti-money laundering rules in order to avoid that revenue from illegal activities can flow in the circulation of money.
In a sub-Reddit , where users of so-called "darknet Markets' exchange , now a user has posted a warning that outlines the extent of the checks. The ostensible bank employees reported anonymously that his institute had been asked by its respective Supervisory Authority to report each customer, could be observed in the payments, which can be associated with Bitcoin and exceed the € 1,000. The present report contains the statement to him that 84 accounts had been featured in his own country, of which 52 were under observation. Prior to the recent prompt the Bank was only obliged to report inputs of more than € 10,500 a year. Furthermore, the request would be a report from Europol on why he bet on an EU-wide action.
First, however, the user would not comment on his country, then he added his report with a link to a previous report " of its Financial Services Authority ", which leads to a document by the Netherlands' Finance Intelligence Unit", comparable to the corresponding unit of the Bundeskriminalamt .
The 80-page case report contained some IBAN numbers to known exchanges like Kraken.com , Bitcoin.de or Bitstamp.net belong. Must be reported, when bank customers received transfers of over € 1,000 of these IBAN numbers. In addition, should be tested if payments over € 10,500 per year, which are not salaries, could come from Bitcoin exchanges.
An employee of a European trading platform confirmed in an interview with Cointelegraph.de that the Reddit report sounded plausible. Bitcoin exchanges are often unwilling to divulge information about their clients only on presentation of court decisions, which is why it makes sense from his perspective that contact the authorities to the banks.
It is unclear who might thus have in his sights precisely Europol. It seems unlikely that drug dealers are running on regular checking accounts their income to € 1,000 can also not necessarily indicative of particularly successful dealer. Perhaps therefore it comes to research on child pornography. Europol had already pointed out in the past that Bitcoin unfortunately also in this particularly heinous form of crime will used."

Thanks for your story.
I haven't been met with laughter as much as I have just general confusion. Whenever I travel I navigate over to coinmap to see if I'll be passing any businesses that accept Bitcoin along the way. Yesterday I was passing through Birmingham and saw that Eagles restaurant accepted Bitcoin. I thought, "Great!" and decided to stop by. After ordering my food and approached checkout I asked (because I never want to just assume based on coinmap), "Do you accept Bitcoin?" and his immediate response was, "What is Bitcoin?" I ultimately paid for my meal with cash.  
There appear to be two large groups of people that I have seen regarding this:
1) People who laugh at and mock Bitcoin like the business owner/employee that you encountered. They have generally heard of Bitcoin, but don't understand it.
2) People who have still yet to hear about Bitcoin and may not know what you're referring to just yet.
Regarding my story, it turns out that you can order your food online with Bitcoin at Eagles, but not in-store. Still surprised the employees were not aware of Bitcoin though. Also, great food, highly recommend it ;-)

The problem is that there is no reliable way to verify an owner in such an instance. Posting it to a forum for the owner to claim would surely be an amusing spectacle.
IMO this is an amazing benefit that we gain from bitcoin. We truly become our own bank and as empowering as that concept is we should take that responsibility seriously.
After reading many responses here it's very obvious that this topic is extremely subjective and dependent on the ethics established by the individual. However, I would argue that knowingly logging into someone's phone/computer and sweeping their private key is blatant theft, whereas finding a paper wallet/thumbdrive on the ground with no way of identifying the owner is fair game. 1) There is no way to verify the owner. 2) Individuals should acknowledge and own the responsibility they inherit when deciding to hold and store their own bitcoin.

Just a thought that I would like to toss out there. So this is not an answer per se. 
Would it be possible to utilize Storj to decentrally host the web content? Regarding the domain, would you not be able to cater to both audiences (beginners &amp; experts) by holding a .com/.org address along with a .bit address to make it fully decentralized? Such a setup should protect you even if your .com/.org addresses were seized, shutdown, etc since you also hold the decentralized .bit address, no?
Just thought this was interesting and wondering if it's possible to take advantage of Storj in this way.

Walter Isaacson is the author of The Innovators: How a Group of Hackers, Geniuses, and Geeks Created the Digital Revolution, out this week.
Micropayment systems have the potential to reward creativity and exceptional content—on a realistic scale
The rise of Bitcoin, the digital cryptocurrency, has resurrected the hope of facilitating easy micropayments for content online. “Using Bitcoin micropayments to allow for payment of a penny or a few cents to read articles on websites enables reasonable compensation of authors without depending totally on the advertising model,” writes Sandy Ressler in Bitcoin Magazine.
This could lead to a whole new era of creativity, just like the economy that was launched 400 years ago by the Statute of Anne, which gave people who wrote books, plays or songs the right to make a royalty when they were copied. An easy micropayment system would permit today’s content creators, from major media companies to basement bloggers, to be able to sell digital copies of their articles, songs, games, and art by the piece. In addition to allowing them to pay the rent, it would have the worthy benefit of encouraging people to produce content valued by users rather than merely seek to aggregate eyeballs for advertisers.
This is something I advocated in a 2009 cover story for Time about ways to save journalism. “The key to attracting online revenue, I think, is to come up with an iTunes-easy method of micropayment,” I wrote. “We need something like digital coins or an E-ZPass digital wallet–a one-click system with a really simple interface that will permit impulse purchases of a newspaper, magazine, article, blog or video for a penny, nickel, dime or whatever the creator chooses to charge.”
That was not technically feasible back then. But Bitcoin has now spawned services such as ChangeTip, BitWall, BitPay and Coinbase that enable small payments to be made simply, with minimal mental friction or transaction costs. Unlike clunky PayPal, impulse purchases can be made without a pause or leaving a trace.
When reporting my new book, The Innovators, I discovered that most pioneers of the Web believed in enabling micropayments. In the mid-1960s, Ted Nelson coined the term hypertext and envisioned a web with two-way links, which would require the approval of the person whose page was being linked to.
Had Nelson’s system prevailed, it would have been possible for small payments to accrue to those who produced the content. The entire business of journalism and blogging would have turned out differently. Instead the Web became a realm where aggregators could make more money than content producers.
Tim Berners-Lee, the English computer engineer who created the protocols of the Web in the early 1990s, considered including some form of rights management and payments. But he realized that would have required central coordination and made it hard for the Web to spread wildly. So he rejected the idea.
As the Web was taking off in 1994, I was the editor of new media for Time Inc. Initially we were paid by the dial-up online services, such as AOL and Compuserve, to supply content, market their services, and moderate bulletin boards that built up communities of members.
When the open Internet became an alternative to these proprietary online services, it seemed to offer an opportunity to take control of our own destiny and subscribers. Initially we planned to charge a small fee or subscription, but ad agencies were so enthralled by the new medium that they flocked to buy the banner ads we had developed for our sites. Thus we decided to make our content free and build audiences for advertisers.
It turned out not to be a sustainable business model. It was also not healthy; it encouraged clickbait rather than stories that were so valuable that readers would pay for them. Consumers were conditioned to believe that content should be free. It took two decades to put that genie back in the bottle.
In the late 1990s, Berners-Lee tried to create new Web protocols that could embed on a page the information needed to handle a small payment, which would allow electronic wallet services to be created by banks or entrepreneurs. It was never implemented, partly because of the complexity of banking regulations. He revived the effort in 2013. “We are looking at micropayment protocols again,” he said. “The ability to pay for a good article or song could support more people who write things or make music.”
These micropayment protocols still have not been written. But Bitcoin may be making that unnecessary. One of the greatest advocates of using Bitcoin for micropayments is the venture capitalist Marc Andreessen, who as a student at the University of Illinois in 1993 created the first popular Web browser, Mosaic.
Originally, Andreessen had hoped to put a digital currency into his browser. “When we started, the first thing we tried to do was enable small payments to people who posted content,” he explained. “But we didn’t have the resources to implement that. The credit card systems and banking system made it impossible. It was so painful to deal with those guys. It was cosmically painful.”
Now Andreessen has become a major investor in companies that are creating Bitcoin transaction systems. “If I had a time machine and could go back to 1993, one thing I’d do for sure would be to build in Bitcoin or some similar form of cryptocurrency.”

Agreed. It's very obvious who the owner is in this case. This is where subjectivity, grey areas and personal ethics comes into play :-). An honest person with well grounded ethics (imo) would return the private key. However, some may argue that the purchase of the computer now places the ownership of not only the computer, but the contents of the computer in the hands of the purchaser. We hear stories all the time of how people have struck it huge by purchasing famous works of art at garage sales for $10-$20. These individuals could have very easily informed the previous owner from the garage sale of the find, but in many cases they do not.  Is this the right thing to do? I would answer, it depends on who you are and where your ethics my lie.

Awesome! Thanks for the change back plus some.
I think being able to scan and hold a physical image as a private key would be a huge plus. The bit of code I submitted basically relies on color codes/pixelation to remain constant from scan-to-scan. So if an image were to fade slightly from scan A to scan B the resulting Data URI/hash would be different even if it was perfectly aligned and result in a lose of funds. 
I imagine creating a threshold on color-codes (keeping them as solid green, blue, red, etc.) would make a future program more forgiving in that respect, but entropy would be lost in that approach.

It's merely the illusion of P2P payments. These systems (Android/Apple Pay) piggyback off of 60 year old technology.

Hey Frankeh, I understand and take no offense.
This is absolutely true for any new payment model. The same argument can be made for when companies started accepting checks, food stamps, gift cards, credit/debit cards and just recently Google wallet/apple pay with NFC technology. I don't think learning to accept Bitcoin as a payment will be much of a stretch for most employees/employers. Just like we don't necessarily need to know the intricacies of NFC technology or how the debit/credit card payment systems work to use them we don't necessarily have to know how Bitcoin works to use it. Though it definitely should be encouraged :-)

Lets turn the tables around. Everyone accepts bitcoin, but we want to transact in fiat. You still have to go through the same dance and now the odds are very much against you because you are attempting to hold long-term a centralized, inflationary currency. 
Now, we can choose from two streets containing the same businesses, one accepting fiat and the other bitcoin. Assuming no dance is needed to convert from fiat-&gt;bitcoin or bitcoin-&gt;fiat, which street would you choose for transacting? 
I want to be a bit more extreme here :-) If you were to be held up by a gunman would you prefer to be carrying fiat or bitcoin? Honestly, if you're carrying fiat it's game over.

WASHINGTON—Top executives from the biggest U.S. banks, concerned about anti-Wall Street rhetoric already bubbling up on the 2016 campaign trail, are working to push back against the prevailing narrative that banks are bad.
Senior executives from seven of the biggest U.S. banks gathered or dialed into a March 31 meeting on the 51st floor of the Bank of America Tower in New York to discuss the upcoming election cycle and how the firms can counteract what they view as false and damaging statements about large banks, according to emails reviewed by The Wall Street Journal and people familiar with the meeting.
The effort underscores the degree to which Wall Street remains a political punching bag and a source of anger among lawmakers and the public nearly seven years after the financial crisis. Already, several presidential candidates have lobbed criticism at Wall Street and directly attacked big banks and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass) continues to exert pressure, warning about big banks’ efforts to roll back financial regulations.
The banks aren’t launching a new ad campaign or lobbying blitz, people familiar with the discussions said. And many bank officials are skeptical they can do much to counteract critics without triggering more damaging backlash.
The lunchtime gathering in March, organized by John Rogers, an executive vice president at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., and James Mahoney, Bank of America Corp.’s head of corporate communications and public policy, focused on what various candidates have said on the campaign trail, which statements were troubling and how in the course of their regular communications and outreach work bank officials could set the record straight, according to one participant.
The discussion centered on finding ways to emphasize the positive role banks play in the economy and the changes big firms have made since the 2008 crisis, particularly outside the Beltway by engaging with local media, elected officials and community leaders, the participant said.
It is unclear if the banks will continue to meet on the issue, though further discussions were likely, said people familiar with the matter.
Those participating included officials from J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co., Morgan Stanley, Citigroup Inc., Bank of New York Mellon Corp. and State Street Corp. The Wells Fargo &amp; Co. official invited was on vacation. Messrs. Rogers and Mahoney briefed chief executives of the banks and other large financial firms the following week during a gathering in Washington hosted by the Financial Services Forum, a trade group that represents the CEOs of the nation’s 19-largest financial institutions.
The banks directed requests for comment to the Financial Services Forum.
“Large financial institutions are putting new rules in place, and they are less complex, less risky, and smaller than before the crisis,” Financial Services Forum spokeswoman Laena Fallon said.
Bank officials contend the criticism from candidates and others is unwarranted. The biggest banks have sold off businesses and retreated from riskier activities penalized by post-crisis rules and boosted capital cushions to historic levels. The 2010 Dodd-Frank law also put in place numerous safeguards against future bailouts, they argue.
“There are always discussions that go on about the industry. Are we more risky than we were before the crisis? Have we gotten bigger? Are we trying to repeal the legislation that changed the terms under which we operate?” Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan, who is the Forum’s current chairman, said Wednesday at the firm’s annual shareholder meeting. “Believe me, this isn’t the case.”
But Wall Street has struggled to get politicians of either party to embrace the message.
Attacks on Wall Street have been most pointed on the Democratic side of the still-young presidential race. The jabs have come mainly from challengers to front-runner Hillary Clinton, and in some cases seem aimed at highlighting her ties to Wall Street.
Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, a self-described independent socialist, followed up his recent entry into the race by introducing legislation to break up the largest financial firms whose failure would have catastrophic economic consequences. Former Gov. Martin O’Malley, a likely candidate, also endorses dismantling big banks and wants to reinstate Glass-Steagall, the Depression-era law that separated commercial and investment banking whose repeal was signed by President Bill Clinton.
More worrying still for Wall Street is the pressure being exerted on Mrs. Clinton by Ms. Warren and the many progressives who continue to press the Massachusetts senator to join the race.
Mrs. Clinton hasn’t gone after the banks directly but she has struck a strong populist tone since hitting the trail last month. “Elizabeth Warren never lets us forget that the work of taming Wall Street’s irresponsible risk taking and reforming our financial system is far from finished,” Mrs. Clinton wrote in a laudatory piece about the senator for Time Magazine’s list of the 100 Most Influential People.
Republican candidates have criticized the biggest banks as still too risky, as well. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, a top contender for the GOP presidential nomination and a former adviser to big banks like Lehman Brothers and Barclays, said during an April event at St. Anselm College in Manchester, New Hampshire that Dodd-Frank has led to “the consolidation of assets in larger and larger banks,” and that the law probably made the financial system riskier, not safer.
The bigger banks face new regulations that are designed to mitigate systemic risk, “but it doesn’t look that way to me,” Mr. Bush said.
Former Texas Gov. Rick Perry and former Hewlett-Packard Co. Chief Executive Carly Fiorina, who declared her candidacy Monday, have both said the problem of “too big to fail” banks still exists, or firms so large and complex the government would feel compelled to bail them out because their collapse would damage the financial system.
“I agree fully with Elizabeth Warren—crony capitalism is alive and well,” Ms. Fiorina said in a May 6 interview on CNBC, invoking Wall Street’s biggest critic.

I thought I saw a request for this some time ago. I just made a pull request to bitaddress.org that allows one to convert an image/file to a private key and bitcoin address. It basically takes the data uri of the file, hashes it and spits out your private/public key and bitcoin address associated with the image. It works well for any digital file or image.
You can take a look at it here ( if you like. You will want to look under "Wallet Details" and then upload any image or file to turn it into a bitcoin address. Please take caution with this code as its security is untested by the community at this point. I just decided to have a bit of fun over the weekend and added the feature. Please let me know if you have any questions.

I've dabbled with this in the past. I setup a proof-of-concept where Bitcoins can be converted to USD via Coinbase and then sent to a specified Google Wallet. This was to demonstrate how simple Crypto-&gt;FIAT conversions SHOULD be. I'm sure the opposite could also be made true (FIAT-&gt;Crypto).
Video for reference: 
Edit for Clarification: Google Wallet is pretty locked down and does not directly support Bitcoin. I have yet to find a way to transact (USD-&gt;Coinbase-&gt;Bitcoin). The only solution I can think of is to send USD to a listening email address which will then convert the sent amount and forward the appropriate amount of Bitcoins back to the email address (assuming it's linked to Coinbase).

You may wish to opt for a mining pool that mines a cpu/gpu friendly altcoin. You wont earn much and you can choose to cash out to Bitcoin or keep the altcoin as a speculative investment, but it's most-definitely a good way to get your feet wet and learn even more about Bitcoin.
Edit: This is a decent site that takes hashing power, electricity costs and other factors into account to determine the most profitable alt-coin to mine at any given time. 
@_date: 2015-07-15 00:25:37
I may jump back into the project sometime in the future. It mostly depends on how open Google Wallet/Android Pay choose to be in the future. If they setup a decent API bi-directional transfers (Bitcoin&lt;-&gt;USD) may very well be a possibility.
Edit: Not open-source, yet. Still too messy. If Google posts an API I will most likely setup another proof of concept and open source it.

I agree, it's the guise of "consumer protection" that credit card companies push onto card holders, but really it's an additional fee charged to merchants for using their network that cover those instances of fraud.
What I think makes Bitcoin so enchanting is that it can be many things to many people and in this instance both a competitor to credit cards and a digital gold to hedge against fiat. I think the reason most people see it as strictly a competitor to credit cards is because it's the first and most obvious use-case. Hopefully as Bitcoin becomes more accessible more people will realize that Bitcoin is more than a convenient and secure way to buy their weekly groceries or morning latte.

Given that there are roughly 60 trillion dollars in existence.
Assuming that the top .001% control 5% of the global wealth.
Assuming 7,260,000,000 people exist on this planet.
-- Get 5% of 60 trillion
60,000,000,000,000 * .05 = 3,000,000,000,000
-- Get .001% of the population
7,260,000,000 * .0001 = 726,000
-- Divide 5% of 60 trillion by .001% of the population
3,000,000,000,000 / 726,000 = 4,132,231
.6 Bitcoins = 4,132,231 US Dollars

There needs to be a distinction between transacting with Bitcoin directly and transacting through a third party.
If third party service or software (Bitpay, Coinbase, Wallets, etc.) wish to start charging 2%, 3%, 5%, etc. for their services through transaction or processing fees they can rightly do-so.
Bitcoin cannot arbitrarily start enforcing higher transaction fees without coming to general consensus on the network. The chances of this happening are, of course, slim to none.
@_date: 2015-02-10 14:05:15
Hey everyone, this was the original post:
As I stated there, "This is just a proof of concept and wouldn't hold up in the current US regulatory environment. (I don't think it would at least.)

Great question. I'll quote my answer from the original post, "At this moment, no. I intend to push it to github in the future once I manage to tidy it up. This was simply to demonstrate how simple crypto-&gt;fiat should be.
I'll be sure to announce the push to github though."

Okay everyone. Time to show your support by racking up and paying off parking and jaywalking tickets with Bitcoin.

Hear here. This comment should be forwarded to Ben Hunt.

This morning for giggles, I purchased a 50 trillion dollar Zimbabwe note with purse.io. Pretty simple so far. I just received an email that my order was placed so we'll see where it goes from here.
I would recommend making a smaller transaction to test the waters before committing to a $1200 transaction.

I second that. Shift has been great. I'm hoping they do a full roll-out soon.

Edit: For future reference, just google the title and use the top link. I would say this works ~70% of the time for me.

This is really worth listening to in its entirety.

Haha, couldn't be more true.

When you pass them do you dumpprivkey too?
@_date: 2015-02-10 23:59:27
Yes! Exactly. Shapeshift also handling fiat alts would be such a beautiful thing.

I use a reserve Google wallet that pushes the appropriate amount of funds to the specified email once the Bitcoin transaction has been verified. As stated above, the Bitcoins are then transferred to Coinbase, traded, and ultimately transferred back to re-fund the reserve Google wallet.
It's a remarkably convoluted process, but doesn't have to be. Ultimately, what I wanted to get across was that anyone, anywhere should be able to switch between crypto and their local currency as easily as what was demonstrated in the video.

Thanks! Me too :-)

In all honesty, I think running a service like this would be considered an abuse of Google's TOS. They don't really have an API for sending payments so I had to hack my way around that.

Great question. This is just a proof of concept and wouldn't hold up in the current US regulatory environment. (I don't think it would at least.) Regardless, the BTC sent to the address would be forwarded to Coinbase, traded on the platform for USD and then transferred to re-fund the Google Wallet used to payout users.
