With this mentality you can argue no one accepts BTC for payment either. But you can buy things with Bitcoin in the same way you can pay your Taxes with Bitcoin, moving the goal posts when it comes to this is why people are downvoting.
Edit: I can see the same people saying you aren't using USD/EUR etc when spending on your Credit Cards....not much point arguing with people like this. "The sky isn't blue, its just refraction, it's actually colorless".

There are many benefits for Bitcoin. But the purpose of Bitcoin is for everyone to be in control of their own unconfiscatable, uncensorable money. Also, you don't need to run your own LN node to be in control of your Bitcoin, there are multiple non-custodial lightning solutions. These custodial "solutions" are hopefully soon to be replaced with non-custodial equivalents.

@_date: 2019-08-31 11:23:28




This is a little awkward to be upvoted here, because Bitcoin base layer isn't for payments. It's a settlement layer with security and right now that's by design.
Lightning Network is for payments. Bitcoin's fees are designed to be high and obviously no one will use Bitcoin base layer for paying for anything if the fees go too high. Which they will.
Basically, this service is only useful with Bcash. They need to integrate lightning payments to capture the Bitcoin users.
Edit: Or Core developers need to redirect energy to start increasing the efficiencies surrounding on chain scaling for Bitcoin. But obviously with LN in development that isn't going to happen.
If on chain adoption starts progressing faster than second layer adoption I'm going to pretty pissed...BUT, this payment service provider can easily integrate LN so I'm not concerned.

I read the testimonies of the only two journalists in the Court room, both seem fucking illiterate (it's on Twitter). CSW gave an interview where he is saying things like "Oh man I tried to hide it from my kids that I had 10 Billion dollars and I was never going to crash the market but I have to give 5 Billion now so my kids will know about the other 5 billion that I have and the BTC market will definitely crash now because Ira will sell them and that's not my fault, I never planned to do it". 
I can't make head or tails of this bullshit situation. You know they couldn't even prove the tulip trust existed? 
If he isn't Satoshi and doesn't have access to those coins then Dave's estate is entitled to nothing from CSW, so of course that is a clause to giving the money. It has to be!

This means its legally recognized that Craig is Satoshi then....the court ruled that he defrauded Dave and he can only do that if he is Satoshi.
This then means if there is a "tulip" trust, that actually had nothing to do with CSW originally, he can now use this ruling to get access to it....

I got banned for this:-
"BTC is decentralized, it's permissionless, Lightning Network should evolve into a cash system that allows for millions upon millions of decentralized lightning nodes. This is absolutely the new system I signed up for in 2013. No one cares about BCH, no one is using it - you were wrong, Ver, why you are beating a dead horse when there is such a better alternative makes no sense. It can only be motivated by personal gain and your businesses surrounding BCH make that clear. Having your employees moderate r/btc makes that clear. You're dishonest and manipulative."
Proof: 
r/btc is as big a manipulative scam as BCH, frankly.
Edit: u/ShadowOfHarbringer just did a "study" on r/btc censorship where he handpicked cases where it was justified and then concluded there is zero censorship. Can one fathom this level of idiocy? 
Meanwhile I get banned for "abusive" for stating my opinion and not even swearing, but in the same thread he justifies censorship he posts things like this:-
"You shills are so fucking dumb thinking you can evade my notice when you are so easy to read.
You come here and you think you can sway the masses by repeating your bullshit."

If Bitcoin can be hardforked successfully that means that there are a group in power that can be lobbied depending on the political situation at that time.
It means hardforks can occur again to change the basic rules of the system, which calls into question the value proposition of Bitcoin.
Right now "bigger blocksize" is the thing, what about if "inflation" is the next thing? Can this be done through a softfork, or must it be a hardfork?

He claimed he mined them with Kleiman and Kleiman's lawers sued for half the value of them, they didn't ask for half the actual bitcoin. It doesn't matter that Wright doesn't have them."

I used to have a laptop that was never connected to the internet and only used for this purpose, I had the most basic version of linux on a usb and would boot into it, download linux version of electrum and load my wallet every time from seed.
At the time this was the best option, it was before hardware wallets were around. Now I can see the risk of the electrum server being hacked - I'd have lost everything at any point in the future without knowing how, even with almost the most advance opsec available. I should have had another usb with a working version of electrum on it, so I would only connect to the internet when the wallet needed opening.
Without hardware wallets Crypto is far far too technical for pretty much everyone, hackers can and will always catch you out at some point.
But the craziest thing I did was having a few hundred on btc-e, I never lost anything before or after the hack. It was a miracle.

I don't think these are good examples of what you are saying, we have no idea if BoA has been planning to start building things or even if they are behind the scenes. The same goes for CSW. These are both on going cases, there is no conclusion. They could both reveal development in the next year, we don't know.
Are there any historical cases where it has been determined the technology patents were filed purely for malicious purposes, to arrest development of the competing technology?

One could equally argue your two examples are part of a practice called “defensive patenting,” in which companies amass portfolios of patents to protect themselves against lawsuits for later released technology. 
In 2018 Cathy Bessant, the company’s tech and operations chief, has been the bank’s key spokesperson on blockchain matters said:-
“While we’ve not found large-scale opportunities, we want to be ahead of it, we want to be prepared.” - supporting the above stance.
Then in 2019 this statement was further corroborated with the following:-
“I haven’t seen one [use case] that even scales beyond an individual or a small set of transactions. All of the big tech companies will come and say ‘blockchain, blockchain, blockchain.’ I say, **‘Show me the use case. You bring me the use case and I’ll try it.’**
As you advised, I did my own research and it is clear at least one of your examples - the only one that matters in this context - is not valid. It points to you being completely wrong about Bank of America just patent trolling.
With the New York Stock Exchange entering the market, along with Fidelity, why is it far fetched other large entities would also seriously consider it? The statements from Cathy are totally plausible. More plausible in face than BoA engaging "patent trolling" against their own peers, who would be using these patents that quite obviously relate to Bank use of blockchain tech.
This is not an argument, it's fact checking.

Who is going through another person's house and even checks inside a memory game book for one example, who then finds 120 random words and decides it's not just an exercise, no - it must be a seed for a Bitcoin wallet that they have to try and crack. It could even be done in a foreign language and be kept in a "learn french" book. Yes, it's impossible to work out as far as real life is concerned, unquestionably.

Interesting. So according to you interest rates affects currencies in equal magnitude to female labor participation.
You should probably let the World's economists know to correct their books, inflation can be controlled by women in Work. 
"No need for negative rates, just fire female staff."
Edit: In fact, female labor participation increased during that time, it didn't decrease like this graph shows. Bah, why should I expect coherency from someone starting a sentence with:

The stupidity is mind boggling. It's just manipulation to prop up the banks. Everywhere else in the World people are leaving cash for pretty much anything, because of in inflation, but in the West the governments have managed to convince their population to do the opposite - and that in itself stems inflation temporarily.

This is a bad idea, you will easily forget. Far easier is to remember a pattern. Write the 24 seed down in a mixed up order, remember that order, and hide it somewhere in your house.
Example: "!" represents a fake word that ISN'T in your seed.
a b c d e f (real seed)
a ! ! b ! ! c ! ! d ! ! e ! ! f
You just now need to remember every 3rd word is real. You can do every 5th word or any other pattern. It's impossible for an attacker to work out.

It adds value that isn't known yet, from current non-participants. You could say "of the people who know about it how many understand it? Of those who understand it how many are in a position to buy in a meaningful way?". I don't think the halving is on the mind of 99% of mainstream investors - so how is it priced in? New people will enter the market as they see the price begin to increase. As we saw each time thus far.

I traded EURUSD professionally for years and I'm telling you - someone with zero experience in trading - that it's normal. So you should just accept it's normal. You can open any chart right now and see this kind of thing and worse on almost any trading pair including vastly larger order book sizes. For comparative daily volume these movements are a daily occurrence.

Bitcoin is a hedge to the current financial system, because it represents a new system that many have acknowledged, even in the present financial system, may represent the future global financial systems. So it's quite obvious why it might be of benefit to stockpile it if there is a potential financial collapse. Also, stockpiling cash is stupid because many countries have limits on how much cash can be spent in any transaction and it would be directly hit by inflation. Did you think Venezuelans stock piling cash was a good idea when their system was on the brink of collapse, or Bitcoin? You seem far too ignorant to be in a Bitcoin forum.

I personally use Bitcoin, since it was under 1000USD, as an easily transferable, unconfiscatable and borderless asset so that I can set up in a new Country anywhere in the world any time I want. It was part of a wealth protection mindset I had at the time. Nothing else came close in terms of these requirements, I never expected it to explode quite like it did in 2017. I'd have been happy with 10k USD by 2020.

TA works because greed and fear is physically represented on a candle chart and market participants repeat the same behaviors over and over again. 
Those with experience can read the story but much like a story you cannot always predict the ending, however, if you are able to listen carefully you can workout the general idea and sometimes act just before it happens.

Not a bad analysis, but I disagree with the "cusp of bear market". Right now there is no telling what can happen because all long term patterns are broken. The price could drop to 6k and rebound to 10k in a single week period right now. There is no reasonable analysis to imply anything more or less.
Also, basing any analysis off of 1hr time frame or below in Bitcoin is a fools errand and it's very naive which I noticed your trader did.

The next financial system will be digital. There will be a global currency that isn't controlled by any single Country. Look up recent comments by Federal reserve, ECB, Bank of England about this and you might start to see the bigger picture.
Edit: 
Cash can be illegal, but you can hold Central Bank digital currencies that is restricted or you can hold the global digital currency that is unrestricted. I wonder what percentage of the entire World will go either way? I wonder what will usher in this new era? Maybe....hm....impending Global recession? Nah, that'll never happen.

Here is a nice prior example of the "build-up" referenced above, on BTCUSD:-
 
The principle is a fundamental trading concept that many aren't familiar with (at 6):-
Bob Volman has some books about it.
@_date: 2019-09-08 06:17:58
So, FA (Fundamental analysis), the parts you can understand, is valid. But TA (Technical analysis), that you can't understand, is not valid.
Both are used to base decisions: FA to work out long term movements and TA to work out the best times to execute those trades.
Everyone here knows Bitcoin is going up long term (FA), but it's their total lack of understanding TA that causes so many people to end up buying high and selling low.

I agree with you. Central banks will issue their own digital currencies and will still inflate them, if people want to protect their wealth they'll need to find an asset that cannot be confiscated, can be easily transported and has a fixed supply.
