I am with you. With such huge good news dumping prices are nonsense.  Hope it is accumulation

First, you gave exactly zero arguments to support your conclusion.
Second, miners are those who gives the network it's security. A none profitable network is a vulnerable network because btc uses pow. Value of an asset is directly correlated with usability and usability is correlated with security. 
Third meltcafe's law is somehow related to miners since btc nodes are of two kinds. Less value implies less miners. How to apply meltcafe's law is arguable but its importance is clear to me.
I would like knowing what are your arguments to claim that it is a falacy, pherhaps I am mistaken.

What ????  (OMG)
You didn't understand what I was talking about and it is obviouse that you don't care. It is all about proof of work, not about miners. Never mind, have a good day

You will agree that gold market security is not related with it's mining while btc mining is precisly the way integrity of the blockchain is preserved.  With that in mind, that example is worthless because btc mining adds trust and trust is valuable. Gold mining adds nothing
EDIT: changed gold related crime for gold market security  to better explain the point.. added of the blockchain
