Funny you said this, just last night I was sitting on the couch and had one of those impending doom feelings when I realized how stupid I was for still having my coins in Coinbase's system. I used to have all my coins in several paper wallets, but after reimporting, selling some, buying some, and paying for things, I had gotten too comfortable with Coinbase, and as much as I think they're a good company and mean well, all the blame would be on myself if something happened and I'd rather not punch myself in the dick. I set up a reminder to get them back in paper wallets tonight.

I'm thinking the best way to counteract this would be to go to a place where there's only one exit and have one of your buddies post up near the exit, so if someone tries to steal anything from you your buddy can tackle him at the door.

Thank you so much I'm sorry to hear that you lost your Doberman :( The unconditionally part is what it's all about. Everyday, healthy or sick, that little tail wags showing they love you. All they ever want is a little affection, something to eat, and a nice comfortable place to sleep. We're all hoping he can have an amazing last few years. He's not a young guy, but I know he's not ready to throw in the towel by a long shot, and so far so good. He may get to come home today, which would be so awesome. He's got a younger brother that's definitely been missing him around the house. Thanks again.

I don't know what actually happened for you, but I have seen where Coinbase says Instant Buy, but if there's a problem with your card that's on file as a backup, it'll default back to just a regular buy which takes about a week. I consider this a bit confusing to users as there's not a more prominent warning, at least not when I did this a few months ago.

Same. I'd have over half a mil if I didn't sell. Whoops! I don't stress out over it though, just a lesson learned on this journey we call life.
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:19:19
I'm not trying to make myself feel better about selling early, but my fear for it is that even though many, many brains magnitudes smarter than mine have reviewed the algorithm, I fear there's something mathematically that could destroy the whole protocol overnight. The cryptocurrency idea would live on, but bitcoin would become worthless overnight. Again, it's probably been checked over a million times, but you know how vulnerabilities pop up when you think you've got everything covered. 
I think the funny thing is I would have been potentially very rich due to being curious about buying stuff on the silk road, just like most everyone interested in bitcoin was early on.

I could come up with some fun ideas for bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:41:25
Oh, sorry, I left some stuff out I suppose. So, I printed 60 bitcoin out to four different paper wallets and told myself "don't touch these for a very, very long time" (with the idea of that being like 5 years)... except I think that only lasted maybe six months before I started touching them. My intention was to leave them alone for a long time as an investment, but didn't listen to myself and began using them early to pay for things. I still made some money, but not nearly as much as I would have now. The lesson learned was stick to your plan if you feel strongly about it and don't give in early to volatility if your plan was to play the long game all along.

If they bring up the topic about bitcoin being able to be stolen, remind them that fiat is no different while sitting outside of a bank. Bitcoin allows for the next generation of start-ups or existing institutions to offer bank-like services that insure people's bitcoin, but bitcoin also allows for people to opt-out of this and to handle exchanging their money globally in a few minutes without being subjected to bank fees if they choose not to. We the people get to choose what we're willing to put up with.

Okay I gotcha, perhaps it just comes with repetition. Like for instance, +tip 50 mbtc verify
Let's see if I set this up correctly, as I didn't have bitcointip configured before. You forced it on me, for which I say thank you :)
So rotating around back to my original comment, if you had tangible coins, what would you prefer to see on it? mBTC? m฿? ฿ with a small m inside a circle attached to it? I guess that's some of the concern I had with having some standardization. Not sure what you'd want to see on a coin, if that ever were to become popularized.

What a lot of you guys are missing is that people need money in hand, and WU does this, and if WU skips the banks and just uses bitcoin they could make more money. WU already has an amazing physical footprint. You're always going to have people that are behind on technology on the sending or receiving end. They just want to show up somewhere and get it and not try to understand a new technology. WU is not going to go away anytime soon just because bitcoin can be sent anywhere in the world for cheap.

I actually had a dream last night that the value of a bitcoin dropped to $2 because of an attack, and while that's a bit of a nightmare scenario for anyone that bought in after that, the real nightmare for me was that I couldn't buy any coins on coinbase. Every time I tried I couldn't type the correct domain name in, or my password would be wrong, and the price kept rising as I fumbled...and then this morning I woke up to $143 and grinned :) I guess me in an alternate universe had one craptastic day yesterday with bitcoin.

I have what is probably a stupid question for you. If gallium melts at 85.5F, how would the coins hold together in most yearly conditions? I've never seen/touched gallium so I don't understand its physical structure at different temperatures, but I'm just curious of how you'd have the coin keep its shape.

I've been using your BW for a while now and it's still my favorite. It's very clean and simple to understand. Keep up the good work! I have a question though. About a month ago I used some coins to play Satoshi Dice and even though I had plenty of bitcoins to spend, Bitcoin Wallet wouldn't let me send out more bitcoins until there were enough confirmations on the ones coming back. So for example I'd send out two bets just fine, but until the returning SD bitcoins confirmed, Bitcoin Wallet wouldn't let me send any additional transactions. Is this making any sense?

That was a very clunky transaction. If payment via mobile devices is going to work (using bitcoins or any currency), it needs to be quick and painless. Even when I use my Samsung Galaxy Nexus to pay with things out of my Google Wallet, I think it's inconvenient at times because I have to unlock Google Wallet which takes it a few seconds to initialize - those few seconds that I or anyone doesn't want to wait because it's awkward. I'm not saying I'm impatient, but I just think if mobile payments are ever going to take off they have to be easier, faster, and more convenient than your existing transaction types. I do know that a few wallets support NFC, but then the ubiquitous iPads do not. With all that said, I'm happy to see bitcoin being accepted locally! :)

@_date: 2013-02-20 03:22:28
I'll give credit where credit is due. I don't think Coinbase is trying to scam anyone (or me), but I do think they need to get their stuff together. If their system is overselling more BTC than they can get their hands on, it shouldn't allow the purchase and then mark it as "high risk" seven days later when they couldn't fulfill the order without their financial loss (I have a feeling it would have been fulfilled if the price per BTC fell below what I paid for it though). I'm only speculating as to what really happened, but that's my hunch. I'll let things play out with Coinbase and see how they respond before I write them off.

@_date: 2013-02-26 16:27:33
The same scenario happened to me. I had some orders flagged due to high risk, they corrected the issue, and then I saw one of the orders not pull from my bank account. However, don't worry, they eventually pulled the money out of my bank account after a few days. Give it a few more days and if you still don't see it being pulled from your bank account, give them a shout. Good karma is good.
