Adding more ALTs to Coinbase soon? Most definitely 
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:28:15
I’m not. It’s for verification. Please DONT send me any BTC
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:52:50

My brother/sister, I’ve been looking for you

This is good, Ripple will hold you
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:56:57
How much BTC do/did you have and why sell?
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:11:53

Word up. I’m a bro

Coinbase ***unexpectedly*** added BCH. No one saw this coming? This evening?
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:03:33
3CWN59y7gfSRvgBc3HnBjFCb2NEB4CtJ1C that’s an address I have.

I promise! If you sent me a BTC, I’ll return it
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:58:37
Time and fees are bad. Alts have some amazing choices
@_date: 2016-07-14 19:33:55
IMO AltCoins and Currencies are here to stay. Whether we use BTC or any other, there is enough demand (in illegal activities alone - which I don't agree with) that only in a non-digital world would Alt related payments be lost.
