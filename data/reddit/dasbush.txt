It sucks, but the reasoning is thus:
If you have the minimum balance, they can loan it out and make revenues (and, well, profits) that cover the services they provide.
If you don't have the minimum balance, they can't loan it out and make that same revenue, so you have to pay directly for the service.

Good Lord.
Here's the formula from wikipedia [edited for general cases]: 
Total Money Supply = 1 / Reserve Ratio * Base money.
So.... that's it.  The reserve ratio and base money are the only two variables in question.  Change those and you change the total money supply.  Fractional reserve banking has a cap as long as those two remain stable.  It can still fluctuate, but it cannot exceed a certain amount.
@_date: 2014-03-01 04:47:39
The only way to increase the money supply with bitcoin fractional banking is to reduce the reserve ratio.  Lower ratios greatly increase risk of running out of funds [ie: bank runs], which is bad.
I don't think this would happen.

Fractional reserving increases the money supply, but only up to a limit.
The formula for the maximum amount of money in the system is:
Total base currency * ReserveRatio^-1
That's it.  If both of those remain constant, then the money supply has an upper bound and cannot be increased beyond this point.  Since the total base currency is fixed to ~21 000 000 and since you can only get so risky with your reserve ratio, there is a natural limit to the M1 and M2 coins, even with a fractional reserve.

The cheques were drawn on a lawyer's trust account we had.  I just had to certify them, which takes the money out of the account immediately and can then be verified by the depositor since we've already processed the withdrawal.

An instrument is something that is holds value.  So a cheque, draft, cash, etc.
An ATM card is access to funds, not funds itself.
It depends, I guess, on how one defines a bitcoin wallet.  The bitcoins themselves hold the value, but the wallet is where it is stored and the private keys are the access to them.  The intuitive thing, to me, is that a paper wallet, for instance, would be count as an instrument.  A lawyer would have to speak up to get more detailed I think.  It certainly isn't a foregone conclusion that one can just bring a cold storage device through customs without declaration.

In Canada, denying low fee basic account services is against the law unless we have cause not to open the account (have reason to believe that the account is being used for illegal purposes, they owe us a boat load of money/we've written down their loans already, unable to provide an address, that sort of thing).
We have to provide a form which states that we have refused to open an account wherein we state our reasons.  This can then be brought to the government watchdog corporation thingy - I should probably remember it's name - and the bank can be slapped with fines if we screw it up.

It's probably worth noting that the exact same thing happened with the Liberals under Chrétien and to a significantly lesser extent Martin.  The Senate takes a lot of time to shift its political spectrum, providing counterbalance to a potentially hectic Commons.  The only reason there are Liberals in the Senate currently is because they've been around for over 10 years.  So there is a natural counterbalancing both for and against the ruling party of the Commons.  Especially in the early years of a government.

You raise a very good point.  I was thinking about throwing half a bitcoin in there or something, and the thought crossed my mind, "How illegal is this?

@_date: 2014-03-14 22:20:34
I dunno mang.
The M1 + M2 total is fractionally reserved, so the total is a function of the amount of base currency and the reserve ratio, and if both remain constant then the money supply is stable.
Bitcoins can, in theory, be fractionally reserved by means of interbank IOUs (which will obviously hate, but we're talking theory here).  As such, even if the bitcoin economy was the size of japan (which is speculation), it wouldn't necessarily require such a large value to have that much currency in circulation.
If fractional reserving is allowed, we have the formula to get to the total monetary supply: (total money) =   To get $1T with a conservative reserve ratio of 10% we need the price to be...
1 000 000 000 000 = $x * 21 000 000 * .1^-1  
1 000 000 000 000 = 210 000 000x  
x = $4761.90 and change.
So if you don't allow M1 and M2 money at all to exist, you're going to get a higher number (well, in this case, ten times higher) to equal a trillion dollar valuation at the end of the day.  Since we wont hit 21 000 000 coins for a while, the number would be higher as well (we'll neglect lost coins for the sake of easy napkin math).
I guess all I'm saying is that you're comparing the fractionally reserve apples to the non-fractionally reserved oranges.  If we put them in the same kind of category, then we get a wildly different number.

They create money in one sense and don't create it in another.
They create it in the sense that they create a new asset, coupled to someone else's liability.  That asset has a dollar value, but they also have a liability that corresponds to the demand deposit.  In that way, the money loaned out is essentially counted twice.  Once as an asset for the depositor with a corresponding liability to pay the depositor on demand and for a second time as a loan asset.  The one liability covers the loan asset and the amount reserved, balancing to 0.
They don't create money in the sense that the money created in this way is also destroyed when the loan is paid back.  It isn't permanent.  The money handed out is base money and the asset is what is the created money.  This asset is destroyed when the loan is paid out.
And what I said isn't nonsense.  The fact that one can use cheques is evidence of this.  The clearing of a cheque costs money, though it costs a lot less than it used to.  That is a service and they have the right to charge for that service.  They may charge ridiculous fees, but the market can apparently bear it.  The adage "Charge what the suckers will pay" comes to mind.
And besides, the banks creating "90% of the money they loan" doesn't apply to what I said.  To reiterate, the banks create non-base money but they have to loan out base money.  That comes from the deposits.  The created money is on their balance sheets, it is never handed out.

His video on fractional reserving is somewhat misleading.  Fractional reserving does not create money ad infinitum, which is implied.  It creates money up to a certain amount.  With a fractional reserve, the only ways to increase the money supply is to increase base money (what we know presently as Qualitative Easing, or "printing money") or by decreasing the reserve ratio.  If both of those remain stable, even with a fractional reserve, the money supply is capped.
@_date: 2014-02-23 07:34:32


People still don't seem to understand how money creation works.  You can still loan bitcoin, and it can still be fractionally reserved.  Just like gold was and just like fiat is.
Let's say the gubmint loans me 10 000 widgets and I loan Satoshi 9000.  I now have the assets of 1000 widgets and an IOU from Satoshi for 9000 widgets and the liability of 10 000 widgets.  Satoshi has 9000 widgets.
How many widgets are in the system?  That's right folks, 19 000.  The IOU functions as real widgets and can be traded as such.
In fact, you use those IOUs all the time.  When you deposit money at the bank, the bank doesn't hold the money for you but rather they issue you an IOU (called a bank account) worth whatever you deposited.  You then use that IOU to buy groceries and the grocery store collects on the IOU from the bank and deposits it at their bank, increasing the value of their IOU (bank account).
[As an aside, this is how I imagine quick point of sale transactions with bitcoin would likely be accomplished if bitcoin were to, by some miracle, take over the world economy.  You wouldn't need to wait for confirmations because no bitcoins (the currency) are being transacted at that point, but only bitcoin IOUs (some form of M1 or M2 money)]
Replace widgets with bitcoin and it's the same deal.  Just because they aren't real coins doesn't mean the IOU can't be traded as if they are real coins.  Right now, those IOUs aren't "real" dollars, but the volume of money has still increased without the government printing more fiat.
As far as this conversation is concerned, the fiat supply is functionally limited, as in the government could stop printing fiat and the system would stabilize at a maximum amount of money.  As such, let's say that bitcoin takes over completely.  If the banks were regulated to have a reserve of X% of bitcoin, there could only possibly be a maximum of  of money in the system.

It's quite large.
A proper retirement plan is ~18% of gross.  This is a solid ~1/6th to ~1/3rd of that plan.  Standard advice is to not have more than 10% in any one thing.  Even if the price remains stable, bitcoin will make a large part of his portfolio and given the risk involved it's not the best idea.  Don't invest more than you can afford to lose and all that.
It's a risk, and it's good to have a small portion of one's retirement plan in high risk/high reward investments.  3-5% of one's income sounds small, but it's quite a large portion of one's investment strategy.

You can fractionally reserve via demand deposits (like your bank account).
You deposit 10 bitcoins at BitBank, and your account says 10 bitcoins.  BitBank lends out 9 real bitcoins to Bob.  Boom, 19 bitcoins.
What confuses people about this is that there is a difference between cold hard money and bank created money.  The bank created money is just a corresponding asset and liability.  So BitBank has assets of 10 bitcoins, the one reserve coin and the 9 loaned coins, and liabilities of 10 bitcoins, the 10 coins *owed to you*.  The accounts balance just fine and there are only 10 real coins, but 19 coins in the economy.
The key is that when you deposit your coins, you don't actually have any real bitcoins.  You're owed real bitcoins.  You have an asset and the bank has a corresponding liability which balances out the equation.
If, for the sake of argument, we were to calculate and balance out all assets and liabilities down to 0 we would be left with the base money only.

Edit: I misread your comment slightly, my argument stands as it addresses your question.  But it comes from an angle where you are asking why deflation actually is a problem.  Sorry 'bout that.
She did a piss-poor job of explaining why bitcoin's finiteness is a problem.  Even though bitcoin is infinitely subdivisible, that doesn't mean that bitcoin isn't inherently *deflationary*.
The problem with deflation is that it encourages holding and not spending.  Bitcoin right now is inflationary since there is a block reward.  But in the future every bitcoin will be mined and therefore any growth in the economy that uses bitcoin for currency will necessarily be represented by an increase in the buying power of bitcoin.
If you knew that every dollar in your pocket would be worth 10% more the next year you have a strong incentive to spend as few dollars as possible.  When people in aggregate stop spending the economy grinds to a halt and we have a big problem.
Economists fear deflation.  Around these parts, deflation is lauded because increasing the value of your holdings is a good thing.  So - if bitcoin becomes *the* global currency, is the gdp growth of the planet going to make bitcoin too deflationary to be stable?  Even if you put it into smaller scales like if a country like Canada had a CanadaCoin that worked exactly like bitcoin, the deflationary pressure after all the coins are mined could cause real problems.  That's why economists say bitcoin doesn't work as a currency.
The problem with that is that bitcoin will probably never get that kind of status, unless there is some utter catastrophe.  On the other hand, the deflationary nature of bitcoin can make it very attractive as a useful store of value alongside gold (which is, these days, useless as a currency).
Sub divisibility doesn't solve the problem.  Just because you can spend a smaller fraction of a bitcoin with a simple code change doesn't solve bitcoin's finiteness.  Each smaller fraction is worth more tomorrow than it is today and therefore you are encouraged not to spend it.  If you don't spend it then the economy falls apart.  That's bad.

It makes sense with goods, securities, and services and the like because there is an agreement between parties that the satoshi is worth what they claim it to be worth.  You can say that the satoshi is worth a barrel of oil because if you sell someone the satoshi you have the concrete item or security to back it up.  So too, a company can say "this one bitcoin is equal to the cumulative number of shares of our company" and then, since the company is the one selling the shares and therefore has the "genuine article" to back it up, they are worth those shares.
You can't really say that 1 satoshi is worth $10 million because in order for it to be worth that someone else has to agree, and why would they when the can just as easily get a satoshi for a tiny fraction of a cent?  Unless the satoshi is just a token representing the cash to be moved around, at which point people are just playing hot potato hoping to not be the last person who wants it.

I'm a bank teller and, while I don't think you have much of a leg to stand on, this is the argument you should use with TD:
First, determine what the cheque hold policy is for third party deposits is for TD.
If it should have been held, say "This was a third party deposit of a cheque to my account from [I'm assuming here] a non-TD client.  You should have held the cheques for 5 business days." (or whatever their policy is).  I hold every single third party cheque that comes to me except in very specific circumstances.
Keep escalating through TD's ["resolving your complaint"]( procedure.  Eventually, you'll get to people who don't have skin in the game for making a mistake who, if you have a case of some kind, will maybe do something about it.

I think most bitcoiners gravely underestimate how valuable a trustless blockchain between banks can be.
I work at a bank in Canada, so let's use Canada as an example.
There are 5 major banks, and a bunch of smaller guys.  Each of the Big 5 take about 15% of the hashing rate, the little guys make up the difference (or whatever).  From that you get near instantaneous clearing of funds and a massive leap forward in fraud prevention between partner banks.  The possibilities there are endless from the customer convenience side and from the cost reduction side.
Imagine paying a contractor to renovate your kitchen.  Type in 10000 into your mobile phone, with the name of the business.  The phone pops out a QR code.  Contractor scans it with his phone and the mobile app checks that the name in the QR code matches the name on the account and that the QR code is valid (more or less standard bitcoin procedure, with some funny stuff added to make sure the money goes to who your want it to like names and dates).  Funds are held for up to 10 minutes (rather than **days**) to get confirmation based on the quality of the clients.
This is practically identical to bitcoin from an end user perspective, right?  Except it now fits neatly into the legacy banking system.

Market cap is price * supply.  Since supply is growing predictably, we care about price only.
What happens when someone buys a bitcoin on an exchange?  They buy it from someone else at a price.  That price * supply is the market cap.
What happens when someone wants to buy 2 bitcoins, and there is one for sale at $1000 and 1 for sale at $1100.  The buyer spends $2100.  The market cap after the first coin was sold was $1000 * supply but after the second coin was sold it was $1100 * supply.
So you see, the $2100 spend by the buyer is irrelevant to the market cap.  So too, the $300 million does not get added to the market cap.  What matters is the price of the last coin bought.

If we're talking about owning bitcoin as part of a balanced portfolio, then one shouldn't worry about massive price swings.  That's kinda the point of bitcoin in such a portfolio - to give access to crazy alpha.
If it works - you're rich.  If it doesn't then there isn't really any harm done.  As part of a balanced portfolio, 1% or so in bitcoin isn't much of a risk.  If it goes to zero - only 1% of your networth is  affected, which considering the upside that bitcoiners see is a perfectly sane gamble.

I work at a bank and people freak the fuck out if you take away the candy bowl.  Seriously, it's mandated by managers to keep the candy bowl - there is a quantified correlation between customer satisfaction and the candy bowl.
I wish I was joking.

If you could clarify what you mean by "liabilities" that would be great.
This post is arguing that you aren't liable for tethers.  Hence having an "asset to liability coverage ratio [of] &gt; 1" is meaningless if that's the case.
So, the real question is: do you have the assets to cover "what a reasonable person would consider USD that you hold in trust for them and could be withdrawn on demand (when the banking gets figured out)" or not?

You're forgetting about slippage.
If you buy $13 billion worth of bitcoin, you'll get substantially less than 70% of all coins because not all coins are for sale at the current price, which is really just the price of the last coin bought/sold.
As soon as you buy all the coins at $x, you have to buy coins for $x+1, and so on.  Thus, the market cap grows while you're buying coins.  Therefore, after buying 1% of all coins, assuming you could buy 1% of all coins for the current price, the 69% of all coins that you still need to buy is now worth more than (13-1% of 13 =) $12.87 billion.

The US Dollar is backed by something.  The most fearful entity known to man...
The IRS.
But for real, if the people who have the guns want you to pay taxes in sea shells then by God sea shells have value and people will flock to the ocean to mine them.  Saying that fiat currencies aren't backed by anything is disingenuous at best, and straight up wrong at worst.

Got a circular at work this morning (am a bank teller) stating that visa would be fixing any issues.  Might take up to a week though.  Sounds like it's visa's problem to me.

I work as a bank teller.  Every now and then someone comes in with stock certificates.  It's very weird and only the old ladies who've been with the bank for 35 years know what the hell to do with them.

This was the thing that I twigged on to the most.
I'm a bank teller and have processed plenty of wires.  He said that the fee was the currency exchange and the bid/ask spread.  This is completely untrue, it seems to me.  But I'm no finance expert getting into the nitty gritty of the costs to the bank, just what what it costs to the customer.
The customer wants to send a wire to another country and so they pay the rate for the day (if you google "usd to cad" for example, you'll get what's called the "settling rate", more or less).  But the client also pays a baked in spread on the exchange that they don't even really see.  Fama seems to think that this is all there is.
But there's also a straight up fee applied on top of that.  Plus the fee that the receiving bank applies as well.  So even in wires that are being sent and received in the same currency, there are still fees.
Further, there are costs in processing a wire.  For one the bank has to pay me to enter the data into the system.  Second, if there are any AML hits we have to be paid to investigate them.  There was also the cost of implementing the system in the first place.
So I don't buy that fees can be dropped to zero.  They can absolutely be dropped, but I don't see how it can be free.  Because Bitcoin eliminates both the human interactions with the system (ie: my job + plus implementing the system), I don't see how banks can compete with Bitcoin in this respect.
The real issue for Bitcoin is that banks are about a million times more convenient, and will be for some time.  And that convenience itself has value.

But why is this harder than IP routing using default gateways?
Honestly, it seems like a similar problem - but I'm ignorant to the technical aspects, only understand the main concept.
It seems like if, say, every university set up a node and people hook up to the closest node then default routes should automagically appear.  A fee is paid on each hop as the incentive for participation.  Since the transaction itself is sent over the internet as TCP/IP (I imagine), it should be pretty robust to failure.
The issue is setting up lots and lots of nodes.
Edit: Let me flesh it out some more....
I want to send a payment to bitcoin wallet address ABC.  The receiver gives me two pieces of information, first his public address (wallet ABC) and second the Lightning Protocol (LP) address of the node he is hooked into.  That node knows which IP to send those transactions destined for wallet ABC.
I'm hooked into a different node, so I send it the transaction with wallet ABC and the destination LP address to my LP node.  From there, a version of a routing table is used to get from LP to LP.
Am I way out to lunch here?
I guess I'm missing something because why don't I just send the transaction directly...

I don't think that is how Coinbase works.  They are brokers, so I believe they have stock/cash and trade their own reserves with people.  If you buy/sell at Coinbase, you aren't trading with another Coinbase client, but Coinbase itself.

This simply isn't true.  Well, not without qualification.  Coinbase is responsible for complying with AML and KYC regulations, but so are the banks.  They have to be proactive in following regulations as well.  If banks start seeing deposits across the board from a company that is dealing in an unknown (to them, and frankly to most people), then it looks extremely unusual and they will follow up on it.  Especially given the recent news regarding Bitcoin.
The banks are required *by law* to look into it.  They are being proactive to ensure that their accounts are not being used for illegal activities.  Their liability for negligence is huge and they are practicing CYA - Cover Your Ass.
I know it goes against the reddit hivemind of the Big Bad Banks, but this sounds pretty standard fare to me.

The only way it would work is if the "bank" held all it's deposits in it's own wallet and merely represented your wallet as an actual deposit.  Withdraws would either be direct from the bank's wallet to the merchant or to your own private wallet.
In other words, as it is with the current system, you wouldn't actually have a proper bitcoin wallet with the bank, but a fictional one.

I wouldn't expect any trouble.  My guess is that the banks are thinking more of a "wtf?" than a "we might need to call our lawyers".

Listen dude.  Right now you need diversification.  You need safety, not a get rick quick scheme.
You've 280k left.  Buy 10 BTC -&gt; Paper Wallet -&gt; Safety deposit box.  Forget about it.  Not a huge portion of your money, but if it goes to the moon then you're in good shape.
Take the rest and go to your *bank's* Financial Adviser, not some guy in the yellow pages.  Tell them this is your inheritance and that you want to be 50/50 risk to safe investments.  You'll need some shorter term investments since you'll have expenses (like paying for your sister's education).
But good God man, stop gambling.

Go to   
Click the "group by" box and select "10"

I'm a teller at a Canadian bank and this happens fairly often.  A lot of the time banks/credit card companies will view large electronics purchases as suspicious since it is an easy way to turn a buck on a stolen card.  Especially if you don't make them often.  They'll freeze the card and they *should* call you (my bank does, anyway) to ask you if the purchase is legit.
I just made a computer purchase from NewEgg as a Christmas present for my dad with the rest of my family and my card was suspended.  They called and I confirmed the purchase.  No muss no fuss.
I recommend calling them.
If this is the case, it is for your security - pain as it might be.

I'm in the exact same position.
I'm finding it hard to be bearish for the immediate future.  But I don't see how it can continue rising without some kind of semi-major correction.
That 900-600-400 business was just speculation gone crazy.  This current rise is a lot more stable.  The Chinese are being super zen about it - not a whole lot of movement even during their peak trading times.  The volume on the exchanges' order books, especially mtgox has gone through the roof even from just prior to the 900 shot.  Big moves are going to be a lot tougher since there's more density on the books.  1000BTC just doesn't move the market like it used to. A buy of 1000BTC only moves mtgox by about +/- $20.  Though, on the other hand, there's more money in the exchanges so 1000BTC might not be as big a deal anymore.
In short, I'd say the next couple days are going up.  It will drop eventually, but no way to know when and by how much.

You aren't going to get your money back.  Accept that and move on.
Single digit returns are safe.  You've seen what can happen with high returns.
There is a fair amount of risk you can afford, ERRR, used to be able to afford.  Now all you have is enough to subsist long enough for you and your sister to get jobs and start on your own.  So you play it safe with that money.
Everyone wants double digit returns.  But that comes with risk.  You've blown over half your money already - you simply cannot afford any more risk.
Stop being an idiot.  Please for the love of all things good and holy, trust the FAs.

Half a million users is quite large, yes.  But Bitcoin is still well in its infancy.  What percent of the population knows anything about Bitcoin at all?  Half that (at least) for Coinbase.
This is possibly what went down:  A few people cashed out big.  Flags went up (reasonably so, large deposits for people that don't make regular large deposits are unusual transactions).  The algorithms noted they were from the same company, and that a lot of other users from across the country were making transactions as well causing more flags to go up.  Wells Fargo starts to investigate in order to comply with AML/KYC.
The personal/business question could (speculation) be regarding taxes also.  Alternatively, they wanted to ask if they were real transactions and not fraudulent/illegal without tipping people off that they were illegal.  Banks cannot legally (Canada) inform a customer that their transactions are unusual and hence they beat around the bush on the question.
The personal/business question is well within their rights for tax purposes, and hence it can easily be used as a cover if we're talking about unusual transaction investigation.  I should note that unusual transaction investigation should not be seen as "we think you are doing something illegal".  It's more of a "this shit you did is out of the ordinary/we're seeing a lot of it all of a sudden and the dollar amount is significant, so we're just going to check up on things to make sure we're all above board."
You're keeping your money there and they are holding it, they have the right to ensure that it isn't being held illegally.  Just like if you ask me to hold onto a car and I see the VIN scratched out or some shit, I have the right to be pretty damn curious as to where you got the car before I take possession.


You're kidding right?  KYC... Know Your Customer.  Knowing what an account is used for and what sorts of transactions go through (in general) is KYC to a tee.
I get that you don't like it, but you can't really blame the bank.  They are following regulations and they have a large liability if they screw it up.  As a teller, if I screw up bad enough I can go to jail.  This is serious shit and they are minimizing their risk.  It sucks, but that's the world we live in.  I don't want people knowing anything more about me than is absolutely necessary for society to function.  But the problem you should have in this case isn't with the banks, it is with the regulators and legislators.
I'm just speaking to the facts of the matter, or rather the reality of what is going on here, not the rightness and wrongness of it.  The fact of the matter is that Wells Fargo is trying to comply with AML/KYC, and the question of "personal/business" is well within that scope.  Whether its right or its wrong is whole 'nother can of worms.
