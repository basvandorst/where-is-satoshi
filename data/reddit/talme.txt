We precisely started this venture to help those people, those getting 10% taken from the money they send. It is cool and exciting to be able to buy beers and pay for hotels with Bitcoins but we believe Bitcoin's real value lies on the potential it has to free the poorest from these outrageous fees. Our vision remains the same, and this is the first step towards building the infrastructure necessary to make that happen.
About the places you mention, they are agents, they sign up with WU, MG, etc and get a cut of the fees. The real issue with WU is that they make money in a hidden way by giving very poor currency exchange rates.
We are confident Bitcoin can make a real impact on the lives of the millions of immigrants' families around the world.

No problem dude, we are passionate about the remittance issue. 
I wouldn't say they are being bribed, these mom and pop stores take the opportunity to make some extra cash for their business. The main issue we faced was the cumbersome regulatory environment surrounding sending money internationally. You have to get licences in practically every state of the US and each one costs a few hundred grand. As a young start up, there is no way we could afford the economic and legal expense you need to be compliant. Hopefully, if our Mexican exchange works out, we will be able to come back with real economic backing and a team of lawyers :).

It is in the road map for sure.
@_date: 2014-03-31 20:16:12
Instances of the same. It is all derived from the fact that the US keeps labeling Bitcoin as money, therefore placing every Bitcoin company that deals with fiat and BTC in the same bag as traditional financial institutions (with the huge compliance costs that accompany these entities).

Hi, Tomas from Coincove. It is closer to Coinbase than to an axchange.
@_date: 2014-07-24 02:44:50
We are tethered to Bitstamp right now but it is in our near term plans to integrate a Mexican exchange API so we can trade there instead. For the moment volume is quite low but we strongly believe it will increase. 
@_date: 2014-01-31 21:04:54
Exactly! (Except we'd want the fees to be closer to 0%) Let's hope that happens in the very near future. We'll do our best to grow Bitcoin adoption in Mexico so that we can make that situation possible very soon.

Some numbers backing the Bitcoin too small argument
Money laundering is the process of throwing needles into a haystack. The idea is to lose dirty cash in a jumble of legitimate transactions. About $8 billion worth of transactions were conducted in bitcoin from October 2012 to October 2013. During 2012, Bank of America processes $244.4 trillion in wire transfers and PayPal processed $145 billion. The bitcoin haystack just isn’t big enough or messy enough to be a useful place to launder money right now. A better option: cash-heavy businesses, such as casinos or—yes—laundromats.

We debated for a while on the layout and settled for a scrollable design because we think it is easier to navigate this kind of design when on a mobile phone. Due to the Mexican economic/cultural context, a very large portion of the population access the internet through their mobile phones. I do agree with you, these one page designs are not my favorite browsing experience when using my laptop.

Hi, Im Tomas, with the coincove team. We shifted our scope from what the article mentions and are first building a platform to buy and sell bitcoins in Mexico. In the near future the plan is to use exit node as a way to send low cost remittances.
@_date: 2014-10-12 04:13:59
This is exactly how we operate.

Congrats to Gabriel and his team!

Hi, Tomas from Coincove here. The first version of Coincove was an attempt at a decentralized money sending service leveraging localbitcoins communities. We were not able to pull it off due to massive price differences in different countries and logistical problems inherent on relying on local buyers and sellers.
You can read about it here

I would love to, Tajin is an incredible place but sadly I have never had the chance to go during the festival. If workload allows it I will try to make it there. Cheers

Hi, Tomas from Coincove here. Just wanted to clarify that Coincove is a Mexican Based exchange. We allow people in Mexico to easily buy and sell Bitcoins (a sort of Coinbase for Mexico). We strongly believe that services like ours are essential for allowing Bitcoin remittances to happen.
@_date: 2014-07-23 23:09:39
When compared to the US, the Mexican banks and the government are being way more lenient. Seems like everybody is taking a wait and see approach, this could of course change very soon, hopefully not.  
@_date: 2014-01-31 23:55:37
@_date: 2014-01-31 18:06:53
We are going with a Coinbase like approach, actual exchanges need lots of liquidity otherwise they have a very limited impact. Don't think Mexico's adoption is quite ready for a Bitstamp type of site.
@_date: 2014-01-31 22:39:53
Thank you!
@_date: 2014-10-12 04:12:41
We are working on instant addresses that will allow immediate conversion to pesos for applications where users should not be exposed to Bitcoin's volatility.
@_date: 2014-04-03 02:04:07
The main problem the Cartels face is getting the dollars -smugling billions of dollars is not easy task- from the US into Mexico and then converting those dollars to local currency.
If they decided to give Bitcoin a try, the first line of defense against money laundering would be the US based exchanges, second line would be Mexican exchanges that accept dollars to buy Bitcoins. 
@_date: 2014-01-31 19:53:07
Yes, we think it is very important for merchants to slowly get comfortable with keeping some of their revenue in Bitcoins.
@_date: 2014-10-12 04:09:32
This is amazing, we are very glad people are using Volabit for this purpose. Excellent walk through. For anyone not very familiar with Spanish, you can change the language of the site to English by clicking on the little globe on the navbar.

Most Mexican banks only allow to open USD denominated accounts if you are a company.

The objective is to increase our FB and Twitter following, very similar to the way hiddencash did it. The more listeners you have, the more you can "preach" Bitcoin.

Thank you for your feedback. We appreciate your thoughts and hope that we can address some concerns by clarifying some points:
We recently dropped our third party payment processor after they increased their fees and made our own payment processing system, which significantly lowered processing fees. Our new in-house system allows us to charge a flat 10.5 pesos (80 US cents) fee for any kind of payment (cash at OXXO, 7 eleven, bank transfer, etc). This fee is only to cover the processing fees that our bank charges, and since we do not use a third-party payment processor, we currently offer the most competitive rates for cash deposits in Mexico.
The premium that we charge over Bitstamp is 1% (which we reveal clearly on our site), but since Mexico uses pesos we need to convert pesos to dollars. We are not a FX broker and can´t even use one as Bitstamp does not allow third party deposits--we have to buy dollars from the bank. When buying dollars from a bank (by making the wire transfer to Bitstamp) nobody gets the inter-bank rate (the one displayed in oanda.com). We thus calculate our dollar price by averaging the "sell" price of three major Mexican banks. We are working on a few complimentary strategies for getting our dollars for cheaper but as with everything in Mexico, things take time. 
Thank you again for bringing up these concerns. I'd be happy to answer any follow up concerns you may have. 
@_date: 2014-01-31 19:44:20
We are sticking to bank transfers to start with, we are also contemplating on taking cash deposits through a large convenience store chain that has more than 10,000 locations.
Maybe in the future we will consider placing some ATMs in some beach towns so American, Canadian and European tourists can easily convert their Bitcoins to local currency.
@_date: 2014-01-31 19:10:18
Exactamente, ese es el plan.
@_date: 2014-11-08 20:27:19
I believe this service will have a huge impact for people working outside the US for US based companies. Paying international contractors is not easy and a services like Bitwage could really revolutionize the way this industry works. I am from Mexico and many of the programmers I know do contract work for American companies on a regular basis. Needles to say the most common way for settling these arrangements is through Paypal which takes a cut that goes from 4% to 6 or even 7%. Factor in China, India, Eastern Europe and you have a large population that can benefit from having their American wages sent to them in the form of Bitcoins. Good job Bitwage guys! I am already recommending you to my coder friends.

Hi, Tomas from Volabit here. We chose Jaime (James in English) because back in the 90's there was a popular Mexican Tang commercial starring a butler called Jaime. It is an inside joke for Mexico's gen X :)

We are working on reducing the currency spread, with our next push we are closing the spread and we hope to keep closing that spread as volume increases.

In a way yes, but unlike banks, we think competition is a good thing. The more ways for people to trade bitcoins the stronger the whole ecosystem grows.

I went a few years ago with my parents. We did exactly what you are planning and drove from Mexico to Veracruz and then on to El Tajín. I can't help you with the paragliding thing since I have never done it. If you do go to Veracruz you have to go to Gran Café de la Parroquia, they have an amazing shrimp cocktail (have it with a michelada). This restaurant is an icon in Veracruz
Enjoy your trip to Mexico

We are getting legal advice from a Mexican lawyer. So far the outlook is good due to Mexico's FinCen equivalent (the CNBV) taking a wait and see approach -akin to many European regulatory bodies- and only warning people that Bitcoin is not regulated and poses a high risk.   
We are very close to start pitching to investors, you can follow us on Angel.co

Hi, Tomas from Volabit here. Just dropping by to say that the YoTePresto team has some really good ideas on how to open up their local platform into an international platform. They knew nothing about Bitcoin a few months ago but after being introduced to it (by me :)) they immediately saw its potential and started devising ways to leverage Bitcoin to internationalize their platform. Kudos to their team.

Also, if anyone is going to tonight's New York Bitcoin meetup I would love to hear any more feedback or discuss any Bitcoin topic whatsoever. The more Bitcoin services and startups that pop up, the happier people who hold some coins (me included) will be. :)  
@_date: 2013-08-20 05:08:20
You are spot on. Give people anywhere in the world the possibility to open accounts denominated in their currency or asset of choice (dollars, euros, yens, gold, silver, etc).
@_date: 2013-08-20 13:00:39
This beta site uses Gox, but could be Stamp or BTC-E.
@_date: 2013-08-20 04:16:06
This is good, so a way to decide how exposed you want to be to the Bitcoin price and therefore letting you decide how much risk to have in your account? Nice
@_date: 2013-08-20 15:20:39
We noticed people making deposits, we never intended for an open beta but now that the rabbit is out of the hat, we might as well give the system a more "real trial". 
Things to keep in mind:
We are aware that sending Bitcoins to random strangers is not a good idea, and we advise against it. However since some people seem to be very adventurous and are sending us Bitcoins anyways you can go to angel.co and check our profile ( and put some faces on who is playing with your coins.
We are not holding Bitcoins, they get turned to fiat immediately and some key points are executed by humans (us) to minimize the risk of account draining. NO FEES ARE BEING DEDUCTED
We have also quickly set aside a fund to back up these deposits in the unlikely case something were to go catastrophically wrong. We won’t say how much it is, but we will stop taking deposits after we reach that threshold.
As you can see, there is no SSL implemented yet, please be careful where you sign in from. We process withdrawals by hand and you get an email when someone requests a withdrawal but one can’t be too careful.
Finally, this is a beta, we can’t control the amount you send us so please keep it to “play money”. We would rather have many people sending small amounts than a few people sending large amounts and reaching the threshold. The more people that try the system the more feedback we can get.
Thank you very much and remember we love feedback, good and bad.
@_date: 2013-08-20 14:28:40
You have to keep in mind that to convert into USD and back it would be 1.2% but that is beside the point. As I already mentioned, this is a beta website, we were gathering user insights in a closed Argentinian group and someone decided this was reddit interesting. The 2% is a place holder – if you log in you will see that fees are waived for the beta - , we haven’t calculated how much the service should cost (or if it should cost at all!). Thank you for your interest and feedback though, this posting on reddit thing is proving to be of extreme value to us as we are getting a complete different point of view from people who are definitely not our target users.
@_date: 2013-08-20 13:01:32

Hi, I am one of the members of the team behind this Project. I posted our website in a couple of Argentinian Bitcoin groups to get some valuable feedback and insights. Our project is geared towards people who want to use Bitcoin as a stable store of value, and as you correctly point out, it is useless for speculators. Argentina is going through tough economic times and the government has heavily restricted access to foreign currency to its citizens. An important part of the Bitcoin boom taking place there is fueled by people who are protecting their savings from double digit inflation and have no interest in entering in the fun but dangerous (if your life savings are on the line) Bitcoin speculation game. 
Argentina is not a rare exception, if you look for countries with capital controls you will be surprised. We believe that it is in one of these countries where the true value of Bitcoin will come to shine. Thank you for the feedback though, we appreciate negative feedback even more than positive.
