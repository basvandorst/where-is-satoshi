I kinda agree, but the people involved with Wikipedia that have discussed this at length probably know more about the cost of going through with this than we do.
They have other cons to consider:
* It is questionable that a significant amount of donations would be coming from Bitcoin as compared to the other payment methods.

Thaft's the point. You wouldn't do it beca use it is too much work and most sites have shitty paywalls. Micropayments do not exist today because it is pointless spending 20 cents on an article and at the same time 30cents in fees. Bitcoin could change that, and such payments could be as easy as one or two clicks and no delay.
You shouldn't think about the status quo but about in what novel ways bitcoins could be used.

Virtual can mean a couple of things, but among those meanings, you can definitely find 'simulated' and 'unreal'. Why not simply go with "digital" instead, which has a much stricter and more fitting meaning?

I understand your point. But take my father, average guy: "How is your virtual money doing?", and by virtual, he means not real. The term "virtual" has a strong connotation with something not being real (e.g. virtual worlds, ...), and as such, the term "digital" is simply better and less confusing.

Even though it sounds trollish, one must be fair and and see that it is not a minor convenience if the blockchain app is the app you are using to pay for stuff when you are outside. Of course, it is a free service, you shouldn't rely on it, have a backup solution ready, etc. In the end, many people (especially Bitcoin beginners) do not have such a sophisticated setup and just want to use the app.

Well, they still might have inserted a backdoor only known to them. If Bitcoins become a widespread global currency, the NSA and only the NSA has the power to seize coins (manipulate balances), etc., which goes in line with what they have been doing so far, according to the Snowden Documents.

It is only theoretically as safe as the host machine (for the dedicated attacker). For random malware that tries to steal your wallet.dat in ~/.bitcoin/ and many more types of automated attacks, a virtual machine is a decent safety upgrade to using only the host system. Especially if you check the 'encrypt home partition' checkbox during installation.
@_date: 2014-03-09 13:06:47


The big difference is that they would be only able to slowly steal a small percentage of everybody's funds, as the word would spread quickly that blockchain.info users are losing their coins. If they had access to the private keys, they could steal 100% of everybody's funds in one go. So while it is not 100% perfect, it is much better.

You got one thing wrong, and many people here confuse this.
There really is a world of difference between 49% and 51% hashing power. With the former, you can get approximately half the blocks, subject to luck, variance, etc. With the latter, you can, if you want, orphan all blocks starting from the point you got 51%. The reason is that the longest chain is the valid one, and with 51% you can outpace the rest of the network and build the longest chain, for as many blocks as you like as long as you have that majority of hashing power.


Just as a casino loses all their money because all players get freaking lucky all the time? Not gonna happen.
With 51% of the hashing power, hell would freeze over before this happened. You should try simulating it with a program or with a set of dices. If you have the majority of the dices in your hands, you are guaranteed to build the longer chain than the rest, and the longer the chain becomes, the more likely it gets that you won't be outpaced due to "luck" of the minority.

While it is a bit worrying, there are a couple of counter arguments:
1. The big players can only cash out once. Once they do, the coins are more fairly distributed. As long as the demand is there, the economy will survive this.
2. Most people do not have the balls to hold when they could already cash in a few hundred thousands, a few millions, or a few hundred millions. Hence, it is likely that most early adopters already sold off the majority of their holdings, and that this will continue into the future. 
3. Altcoins can alleviate some of those worries. Satoshi probably does not hold a similar amount of, say, litecoins. I assume that in the future, there will be multiple digital currencies that can be used alongside Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-05-15 04:52:15
When a block is found and relayed throughout the network, how do you know who found it? Many pools add an ID into the coinbase transaction, which is what is used to identify pools and show their name next to the block on blockchain.info and other sites.
Nothing stops them from broadcasting blocks with no such metadata.

That is probably true, for people who trust their banks and governments. Does not make it less worthwhile having the option though for people that don't. 
If you are living in a country where it is not unlikely that your money would at some point be stolen by your government or your bank, you would be happy to have the option to make that impossible. Also, Bitcoin allows for perfect hybrids: banks that secure your coins, but still cannot take them away and that give you full control (via multisig/timelock and other tricks).

I am not completely sure if you understand what 51% means. If they mine on the main chain along with all others, yes, they are only getting approx. half of the blocks. But if someone *owns* 51% of the hashing power, they can mine on their own secret chain, which will be longer than what the others can produce on the main chain. Do the math, the likelihood is not as hilarious as you think.
Say I had 55% right now, and could have it for one day. I could almost surely rewrite one day's worth of blocks (if the protocol even allows for that, I am not sure if the protocol has a rule that prevents arbitrarily long chain rewrites).

Not saying that calling it virtual is *wrong*, but the term *virtual* has many more meanings than "run by computer".

@_date: 2014-06-14 22:14:28
Well, the only reason it is needed is because if it was half the hashrate, it would be easier to gain 51% of the power by buying/building miners. So it always has to stay at the limit of what is currently possible. 
It naturally converges to this though.

That might be true, but consider this: with this attitude, we will lead bitcoin to the same place the current system is at: centralization.
However, we have the technical support in the Bitcon protocol to build bitcoin banks that have provably full reserves, and provably no undue control over your coins, and many more nice features. Coinbase is not implementing any of them. We need to support companies that do. We truly can have our cake and eat it too (letting a company take care of the security details while still not allowing for the possibility of "too big to fail").

That is wrong. A pool member solves the hash of the block as put together by the pool operator, blindly. The pool operator decides what blocks everyone is working on, what transactions are included, etc.

Block explorers store a massive index of all inputs and outputs linked to every public address ever used. Your bitcoin client only stores an index of the addresses *you* use.
blockexplorer.com stores a database of 100GB and upwards. It could be done better, but it would be overkill for every client to do that in any case.

Of course, by this convention (more or less): the sum values of all unspent outputs that reference that address in the script, if the script is one of the three standard scripts (p2pk, p2pkh, p2sh).

If I was a large bank or a government that does not like this currency, I would gain a lot: massive loss of trust in digital currencies. For many people, the economic incentives from within the BTC network do not mean anything when its death would be worth so much more.


If you own that much hashing power, you can mine secretly forever, it is not detectable until the new chain is released. You are probably thinking that you can detect it by that pool not mining many blocks on the main chain anymore. But in reality, we simply do not know how much hardware Cex.io/Ghash.io have amassed with poor investor's money. I personally do not think it is likely that they have the majority now, but if they had, we could be fucked. In any case, solving the problem for real and discussing solutions to it now should be preferred to downtalking the problem. We never know what kind of forces might enter in the future.


I am glad you are one of the people who listens and does not simply dismiss, so thanks for that.

No, it is not. "Performing a complex algorithm" would be correct.
@_date: 2014-08-29 12:43:22
Which is fine by me, as this gives incentive not to keep the coins centralized. 
The other reason why this is okay: banks will find a way to integrate Bitcoin and still be able to cover such losses. They could do as Coinbase does: insure for loss of the hot wallet, which is a fraction of the cold BTC reserves. Also, future Bitcoin banks will operate with fractional BTC reserves anyway, which is even easier to cover in case of loss.
@_date: 2014-06-23 06:31:30

51% hashing power enables you to secretly build the longest chain and publish it at will. Guaranteed. If I had 51% now, I could secretly solo mine 200 blocks, and afterwards cause all the blocks mined on the main chain in the meantime to be orphaned, due my chain bring longer because of more hashing power.
 
Bad things would follow: all coinbase transactions from the orphaned blocks (all new BTC generated but invalidated) and all transactions that are dependent on them would become invalid. People would lose money. 
So yes, while you can't do everything you want to the blockchain, you can do enough to seriously fuck with everyone's investments.

@_date: 2014-06-14 03:45:41
No, not because of variance. There really is a world of difference between 49% and 51% hashing power. With the former, you can get approximately half the blocks, subject to luck, variance, etc. With the latter, you can, if you want, orphan all blocks starting from the point you got 51%. The reason is that the longest chain is the valid one, and with 51% you can outpace the rest of the network and build the longest chain, for as many blocks as you like as long as you have that majority of hashing power.
Sorry, I'm on the phone, I would like to explain in more detail.

It is a pity, only because the first brain wallets used one round of SHA256 hashing. If the term "brainwallet" would be associated with scrypt hashing, parameters cranked up and all, all but the simplest/stupidest passphrases would be secure enough.
Also, if you used a 12 words passphrase as generated by various deterministic wallets, you are good to go even with one round of SHA256.
Brain wallets are only unsafe if you manually pick a passphrase. They are safe if you randomly generate a 12 words passphrase.

That is why MtGox is demonized. It is because they are unable to fix their mess and instead put the blame elsewhere. Do you hear blockchain.info or kraken.com say the same? Nope. Bitstamp, while affected, at least show confidence that they will have a fix ready soon.

This is not true, respectively not so simple.
A malicious mining pool operator with more than 50% mining power could, for example, secretly mine a chain of 30 blocks starting from block A, and only publish it with the 30th mined block. As it had more mining power, this will presumably be the longest chain in the network, and all other nodes will switch to that chain, orphaning all previously mined blocks after A which were in the main chain before.
The malicious attacker could have done many double spends, which could have up to 30 confirmations in the new main net. They will not be orphaned because the new main net is, by protocol, valid. Undoing that is close to impossible / really really hard.

So if the original owner comes along in 1.5 years and sees his funds gone, what then? If OP would have left them, there is a good chance they would not have been stolen by anybody else. Many bots are bruteforcing passphrases right now and none of them have found those funds. Why should OP be the one to decide? 
The obvious solution is to try to contact the owner, and if this fails and the coins are indeed stolen, then it is the owner's own fault. It is, contrary to just taking the coins, the fairest option.

You cannot know which transactions belongs to one entity. Apart from the transactions that identifies you directly (i.e. you provide your identity when buying something), none of the transactions before or after need to have originated from you.
So while you can see the full transaction history, you do not know where (and from whom) any of them came from and what their purpose was.
Also, there are tumblers: many people send coins into one black box and everyone gets their coins out, but from different outputs. After proper tumbling, tracing is impossible.

The original discussion was you saying that MtGox need not have an XSS flaw but another site might have, which is enough for stealing cookies on MtGox. This is not true. In order to steal cookies from MtGox, MtGox itself needs an XSS flaw.

I read the code, however, it has bad structure and it would require quite some time to find out in detail how the keys are derived. What I would expect is documentation along the lines of "root code means X, chain code means Y, stretching algorithm scrypt/bcrypt/... is used with parameters defined/computed here, bitcoin private keys are derived from BIP0032/[insert specification here]", etc. 
Edit: what I am saying is, when I store the root key and chain key, I should be able to reconstruct the private keys even if Armory's code vanishes or changes in incompatible ways. Simply making the algorithm/parameters easily accessible goes a long way.

If I told you to repeatedly give me a zero or a one with uniform distribution, you could not do it reliably, and I could find a pattern. If it was random, there would not be any pattern. Humans are just bad at it. If you have a list of words, and many people choose "random" words, the distribution of the words will be non-uniform as well. 
There is an online game (which I cannot find right now) where you need to randomly click on two buttons, and the computer would try to guess which one you will click next. For each correct prediction, the computer gets a point, for each false prediction, you get a point. If you are good at randomness, the final result should be 0 points, but the computer would win each time.

How do you figure it will go down when OP does not find the owner? It would definitely not mean that the owner forgot his coins or would have never redeemed them. OP cannot take responsibility of returning the coins a few years down the line. "OP found them, he can keep them" is obviously pretty lame, because as much as people like to pretend, "finding" Bitcoins is not the same as finding a wallet on the street.
@_date: 2013-12-03 22:54:43


Assuming the owner will not check his brainwallet for one and a half years, the fairest option is to leave the funds be. OP cannot be chasing the owner forever, and if the funds happen to be stolen later, it is the owner's fault/bad luck, but it is not fair for teh OP to take them and just wait out an arbitrary period of time until he can claim it his own.


If this would be guarantueed, then I would need a guaruantee that OP will try everything in his power to reach the owner within that year. But since the theft is not guaruanteed to happen within a year, the fairest option is to leave everything as it is.

You can just as well explain it like that, it's how it is, after all. The only thing to add is that everyone in the network (to be exact: the majority) is holding the lock in mutual agreement, and all decide together when/how many coins to unlock.

Are they suggesting that centralized development is good? 
About the dust example: if the dark wallet team decides to ignore it, the majority will force it one way or the other. If the majority rejects dust, miners who accept them will lose out. That is kind of the strong point of decentralization.
 
If Bitcoin breaks because there are multiple implementations, then it should do so, the faster the better.

Could very well be true, but on the other hand, there is no denying that currently you have very few possibilities to actually spend your bitcoins. So people are obviously not buying the bitcoins for the reason that they can use them as a currency. I am not saying that it won't happen, but right now, Bitcoin's value rise is significantly outpacing its increase in utility. So merchants need to start accepting Bitcoins en masse soon, and holders need to start spending too.

Yes, but unlike traditional lost+found cases, the "found" Bitcoins are not missing for the owner. Can OP claim finders keepers right if the original owner does not come forward within a given time? I think it would be very unfair, because the owner might not be checking his cold storage brainwallet very often, might not be visiting reddit, might not be from the same country as OP, etc. 
If OP takes the funds, it is as bad as stealing in my opinion, because the owner cannot be expected to have seen this thread or any message by OP. Furthermore, in normal lost+found cases, the owner is expected to ping the lost+found center or the police after the loss, but with a brainwallet, the owner has not even lost anything. Not to mention that Bitcoins are global, so OP cannot ask every police station worldwide whether they have a lost+found notice.

I know you want to give good advise, but what you are saying is not true. Trying birthdays from 2 to 100 is quick, but having a combination of 12 words about your life, chosen from a pool of say, only 100, and you have [5.03 * 10^23]( combinations, which is hard to bruteforce.
Edit: disclaimer: I agree that having many random words is the way to go. Just trying to clear up some misconceptions.
@_date: 2013-12-03 16:00:07
In Germany, it seems you gain ownership after six months. So you can transfer any Bitcoins you can get your hands on to your own wallet, tell your local lost+found shop/police that you have found some  Bitcoins and you don't know the owner, and then wait for six months, because whoever lost them will have a hard time finding the right authorities to contact...
@_date: 2013-11-25 15:29:23
Electrum has a predefined list of words, and having 12 random ones from that list gives you ~128bits of security, which is plenty. 
If you want to generate your own brainwallet then yes, words from different languages would be more secure. Don't forget to choose the words randomly, though. And no, coming up with your own words is not random.

It's still a whole e lot better than credit cards and PayPal with regards to anonymity. You have to see that the protocol itself is traceable but anonymous, and only when you provide your identity in a transaction your anonymity is lost. Luckily, the protocol is only the base layer, and tumbling/tor etc. allow for true anonymity.
The average user is still a lot less traceable. If I send 90 percent of my coins to another address I own, no one can prove the coins are mine indeed.    
@_date: 2013-11-25 18:36:45
There is a misunderstanding, I wasn't talking about inventing new words; I was talking about manually choosing existing words yourself. Humans are bad at randomness, so you better let a computer handle it.
@_date: 2013-12-03 23:17:33
So how long should OP wait until he can keep the Bitcoins for good? If we assume this to be "cold storage" for the owner, the timeframe needs to be several years. So if the owner notices the missing coins in, say, 4.5 years, will he be able to contact OP and get the funds back? Can OP take responsibility for those funds for that long? What if they are stolen from OP in the meantime? Too many unsolved questions. Since we don't know the future, the *fair* thing to do is to do nothing. Anything else could make matters worse for the owner.

Only a tiny bit over 50%, and losing 10 times in a row *is* unlucky, because the odds are much, *much* higher than 50% that he would win at least one of those.

1.6e21 is about 70 bits of entropy, which is not bad. It is obviously less if your dictionary contains less words, hence the 44 bit entropy estimation in the comic. The comic shows that this simple method is **far** better than using a common password like described in the first panel.
OP's password is much safer than 70bits as it contains more words, punctuation an capitalization. 
TLDR: OP's password is not too shabby.
