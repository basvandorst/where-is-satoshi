Did you replace the battery in your smoke detector like I told you? Get a 9v rectangular battery, twist off the bottom of the smoke detector, and change that shit. It will change your life and save lives.

The most important piece of advice in this video is to replace the battery in your smoke detector. It's a simple 9v battery you can buy at Walmart, but not with bitcoin. I hate that low battery beeping, and those things save lives.

So you want to take economics back to the barter system? Anyone can accept anything for what they feel is a fair deal. You still have to pay taxes. If I buy your car for 30 bitcoins, then I have to pay for car registration and fees. You have to file your 30 bitcoins, and report that income.

Just stick to teaching economics. Don't throw in some pseudo-crypto money when they probably can't even understand debits and credits. Let them figure out the basics of balance sheets, stocks, reports, excel, and whatever for the class. Then at the end you can add a bonus points paper for a report on bitcoin or e-currency.
Edit: You could easily spend a whole year debating keynes, austrian, classical, neoclassical, chicago, supply side, and whatever to fill the class. Teach them the basics first.

Taiwan is pretty much cash straight up. Bitcoin won't work there. Checks and debit/credit cards aren't really used for transactions like that. Family Mart wouldn't take credit and said go to the ATM in the corner to get some cash.
I can however confirm that is a Taiwan Family Mart and they are on practically every block. 7-11 and Family Mart are just welcoming for people. Do you want hardboiled tea eggs, hot dog, buns, salad, snacks, drinks, beer and liquor 24/7, and you've found the right place. Just not the right place for bitcoin.

It doesn't help. It makes it more difficult, time consuming, and more expensive to even attempt to get cash from bitcoin in another place. Financial institutions aren't idiots.

You honestly think stealing someones identity is easy? I'm not sure you understand how selling property works. You give me the money and I give you the property. Otherwise, no deal.

You aren't getting my house or car without multiple verification. What is that, multisig?
You can try to buy my car as Thomas Johnson, but you can't when I have multiple layers of approval.

Yeah, this a pretty good way to lose your medical license, get sued, or go to jail. Just going to an online doctor is a terrible idea. Doctors don't just normally give you good advice. Sometimes blood tests, MRI, CT scans, and other things are needed to focus down on your problem. You aren't going to skype some internet doctor and hope he can tell over the webcam if your cornea is torn.

They don't want **anything** but pesos. They want American cash and they have for a long time. Bitcoin means nothing. Argentina is dealing with much larger problems where an unstable and tiny crypto currency can't help. This is a large government and economy. The adults have their dinner table to talk and they don't take the kids at the little kids dinner table talk seriously. No self respecting adult wants to hear of some magical Disney promise that can change everything. Bitcoin in total can't even compare to a decent company let alone an entire South American government.

Now I'll be critical. Using Bitcoin to give change to a homeless person won't work. Do some good and volunteer at homeless shelters, seriously.

ETF's and index funds are managed. Some may be passively or actively managed, but I understand your point. However, you normally can't freely sign up for these investments without a financial broker.
Banks certainly do exist to make money. I give/loan them $30k and expect a return like an interest fee. VFIAX in this case paid me back +13.56% ~~YTD~~ one year to this date just so they could use my money to make money.
Now they have extra money to loan someone money for a car, house, school, or bills. They charge an interest fee on that loan and make their money back with profit.

Believe what you want. I was once hooked on a legal drug. Consider the addiction and withdrawal equal with heroin. A few years later it became illegal and was Schedule I, the highest level. I wasn't going to chance a felony and sobered up in the most unpleasant way. Since it's still highly illegal I'm not chancing my family.
If they now decriminalized it a decade later then I would go right back to being an addict. It was the self medication I needed for sleep. I'll pay the fine, probation, or whatever. There wouldn't be less desire to self medicate.

I appreciate your response and will read further into what you linked. I've known about Ibogaine for a long time. I've been sober for a long time. No plans on going back. No problems. 
I was saying if it was decriminalized then I would probably buy a supply online. It took care of sleep, mood problems, and motivation in controlled doses better than what the doctors think they know. This was my treatment and got me where I am without prescriptions. Like I said, sober for over a decade, no worries. Still pretty sure I'd be better off with my own self medication. No worries, I could probably get it illegally, but not my thing. 
I honestly thank you for your care. I'm good and sober for a long time. Just saying if it was decriminalized I'd give it another go. That obscure drug propelled my life forward at the time.

No the agent was asking if "we" should just intimidate them. They could just give them a scare, but there is the other option. And Ulbricht said scaring them won't work because they'll run away and he won't be able to get the coins back. I'll take the other option because I need those coins back. Are you sure DPR? Yeah, how much? Sounds expensive, but I'll pay.
Edit: **Redandwhite 3/26/2013 20:08:** FriendlyChemist refuses to meet up with us because of what he fears will happen. People are starting to suspect that he will go to the police, which is not a problem because he would never be able to give up anyone of importance since he only has ever had contact with low level people in our group and they always take precautions so that even if someone were to turn informant, they would not be able to get any charges to stick.....**If you can get FriendlyChemist to meet up with us, or pay us his debt** then I’m sure I would be able to get people in our group to give this online side of the business a try. 
**Dread Pirate Roberts 3/27/2013 23:38: In my eyes, FriendlyChemist is a liability and I wouldn’t mind if he was executed**, but then you’d be out your $700k. I don’t think he is going to come up with the money because he seems very desperate.

As I stated, it can't be tracked. The money gets filtered out too fast. I'm not even including coins. Don't think they haven't thought about it. The idea is unfeasible and preposterous. I give a store a $20 bill and they change me out in smaller bills. Then my $20 goes to the person next in line. Then their friend pays for lunch and they give them that $20 to pay them back. Do that all day long and try to follow that bill. It vanishes.

That's a fact. Use cash if you want you want to stay anonymous as possible. Walmart can't capture anything if you pay cash. You can sometimes get much better deals by paying in cash. Private sellers and small businesses will take cash in hand for a cheaper price almost everytime.

The federal government and no states accept bitcoin as direct payment for taxes. Only New Hampshire and Utah are exploring the idea of people paying with Bitcoin. That's not many states.

They still might laugh at you. He bought at over $620. It's currently around $230. That's all fiat based. Without cash is king what would it be worth? Anything or nothing? A gallon of gas or milk?
@_date: 2015-02-05 17:00:32
Fine, I deleted my comment. Jesus. 
They have a bizarre fundraising setup going on that raises flags to me. It seems like even if they don't make quota they will supposedly spend all the donations to complete the current mission of v0.2 by April. Then they will ask for money for another target goal, and then ask for more money. Keep repeating until they get to v1.0 which will be usable. However, not all of the funds actually go to development. That's all going by their website.
@_date: 2015-02-11 11:48:58
That is brilliant. A trustless and free market system at work.
@_date: 2015-02-05 16:35:03
You are going in circles. The "hitman" said he can just meet up with the guy and try to get the money off of him. DPR says he probably can't pay up, fuck that, he's going to snitch on me so just kill him.
Now lets put that with what you had just said.


That is patently false. Now you say, well there was some missing transcripts(source?) He's a liability, but I wouldn't mind if he was executed. He should have taken his lumps for running a website that did illegal things. Instead he digs his hole deeper by asking to have the guy killed so he can keep business going. 
Edit: Couldn't he have closed up shop, cashed out, and got the hell out of the country instead of asking for people to be murdered?
@_date: 2015-02-23 08:58:58
Holy shit, I almost did the same thing. I gave them my credit card and said I'll cover the tab plus tip. It was so quick and easy. Didn't have any explaining to do.
@_date: 2015-02-22 04:32:11
Okay, I'll guess that it's unusual for bitcoin markets or middle men to go out of business and vanish with your coins. Then I would also suppose it strange to find people being hacked and having their accounts looted. Bitcoin may not be your best option.
@_date: 2015-02-18 19:51:58
You can always have your own thoughts on morality. People may hate your ideas, and that is the end. They'll call you an asshole. When that morality gets put into law then you've gone beyond the social line, and ~~everyone~~ the majority has agreed you should be punished by a vote of your peers.

Wait, you are being serious? I thought you were joking. I read that completely wrong. Oh the glory and humor. 10k of what? I don't know, but it's coming my friends.

Defensive measure? Seriously, what world are you living in? Read the transcripts.
@_date: 2015-02-22 23:30:40
This is a great idea. You might be promoted to manager for thinking outside the box and how to increase business profits. Definitely do it, but don't tell anyone. They might get jealous that you are ahead of the curve. At some point you will make enough money to start your own store that accepts bitcoin. It's the future buddy, and you are there.

He wasn't licensed like the other legal gambling places in Nevada. I think there was more to the warrant than that. You can disobey any laws you want, but don't bitch when the consequences show up.
Gambling addictions, just like any addiction, have caused a huge amount of crime. Should we just legalize everything so nothing can be classified as crime?

Steal? Do you mean confiscate them by law and judicial rule? They found these bitcoins in his possession and Ulbricht was found guilty of some serious crimes. Whether you agree with the law or not is of no importance. No person can live in a country and repudiate its laws as if they have no meaning.

@_date: 2015-02-18 19:18:29
This is a really sad day for this subreddit. The top comments are asinine opinions about the evil government stealing "property." Ulbricht gave up the coins. He was then found guilty. There is nothing here to defend.
If you avoid taxes, or make profit from illegal business then you are subject the law of the land you live in. If that sucks then maybe try to do business in another country like Somolia where it might be legal.

I will honestly try to get back to you in half a day or a day. Right now, off the top of my head, a legitimate business plan. A real business plan that shows how long, how much, expected revenue, etc. If you don't have a business grad, or MBA in your group of guys then someone start learning how to develop one. Basically, a very involved FAQ to prove your business acumen. Google "business plan" if you have to. That's just a start, and it gives you real basic goals.
You would be able to do Q&amp;A's or AMA's far easier. Get a plan down. Don't just stick your hand out asking for donations. For example: I don't really know why you need a donation now besides you saying, "give us money please. we are trying to help the bitcoin." That's proof of nothing. Have to say, I like your website though.
I need some sleep. I'll see what I can do later. Hope my response isn't shit because I'm in zombie mode.
