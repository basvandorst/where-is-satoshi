I'm a very trusting person, and I like to test the boundaries sometimes within reason, I've made enough and haven't been scammed yet ;) Bitgold is interesting because they offer deals to get extra gold for free (referral system, +x% free gold for setting up automatic purchases, stuff like that) and you save on getting the gold physically shipped (which they claim is an option), they also plan to allow you to redeem your gold back into bitcoin, so if it is legit the idea is versatile
@_date: 2015-12-08 16:12:37
How do you know it was waste? Finding consensus is a process in itself which takes time, it allows the entire system and those involved to find clarity, and that's what we need more than anything. There's a reason why we don't have one person or one team of people who think they have the answers pushing changes through, it would be reckless.

Of course it's not too late, this is the beginning of a huge new technology for the human race. It's on the cutting edge right now, which means learning anything you can about it and similar topics will fuel new ideas to push the boundaries even farther. So it doesn't even really matter if Bitcoin itself has real staying power, though I think it does. Profitability is also important and i'm positive that there are business models that are highly profitable right now, and could become increasingly profitable as time goes on.
@_date: 2015-12-21 18:42:18
Terminology doesn't matter, call it whatever you want, the idea is to have one or many ways to either fund or defund any entity, optionally, by anyone. Non mandatory taxes allow the majority to have more wealth so that they can vote with their money within their own means or not at all. Some methods could offer incentives, or just straight donation. The details would have to be more developed of course and it would require a huge transition from what we have now. 
@_date: 2015-12-24 06:17:23
You are talking about people losing coins because they trusted a faulty service and/or had their password phished, things like that are unavoidable within any system like this. Do you think it can't happen to a bank account?
I'm talking about the strength of the bitcoin network when used properly. It's pretty easy to not get scammed. And if you were to theoretically pay Hyatt Hotels in bitcoin, you aren't getting hacked in the same way that the payment cards are. The problem here is, there's nothing a card user can do to prevent the thing from happening in the first place, they're at the mercy of an overall weak system.

That doesn't seem very decentralized. Sounds more similar to banks and federal governments to me.

There has always been a small fee to go towards the miners who help run the network, when was it not like this? And if you don't want customers to pay the small fee, you can always inform them that you are lowering the price of your product/service by whatever the average transaction fee is to cover their bitcoin transaction. Either way someone has to pay a small fee which is cheaper than card merchant services in almost all cases
@_date: 2015-12-02 16:06:40
bitgold, not 100% sure how legit they are, but i'll take the chance, I have the option to hold it in their vaults or redeem physical, so the only thing i'm worried about is the non physical ownership, easier to deal with though if they hold it

Is it possible that the concept of state sovereignty is becoming outdated? Something like bitcoin could allow us to slowly transition into a type of system where sovereign government can no longer thrive because they can't print money. If they can't print money they can't fund an army or police force like they can today to maintain the illusion of control, and enforcing taxes would be much more slippery. A government entity would need to attain VC in a way that is actually deserved and justified.
That's where investment and voluntary taxes come in. If our current system breaks down and mass adoption happens wealth should be more evenly distributed after it all plays out. So, instead of one concrete government attempting to run society with impunity (or rather, the elite and corporations act with impunity while the gov absorbs accountability like a shield), it could be corporate type entities that take up the tasks separately, and their primary source of funding could be through investment of the people. This way, should any entity become corrupt and stop benefiting the majority, all it would take is the people collectively pulling investments and causing that entity to become crippled or inoperable. 
Or as another option (in the case where a lot of funding comes from a corrupt elite group). The people could at least fund a competing startup, and with enough support influence the corrupt entity to change due to competition.
It would be like politics but faster, with real accountability on a decision to decision basis, and should result in much less corruption and inequality.

Not all systems benefit from being decentralized, and I think the blockchain will have applications in handling data transactions in an easier to implement and highly secure way, even in a closed system. It will take more time and development, but I think the blockchain can eventually be packaged as a system to be used for more specialized purposes outside of finance

Banks won't refund all levels of stupidity, especially if the money you lost can't be tracked down. If you are extra stupid you may need to pay for some kind of identity protection, if you don't spend that extra money then you are less protected from your mistakes. They will of course insure you if it is their fault or the fault of a verified 3rd party. So as long as you are cool with dealing with customer service after having a panic attack because your entire account is wiped due to the fault of the hotel you swiped a card at, more power to you.
With the Bitcoin system, yes, if you send bitcoins to a place that you thought was legit but wasn't, you lost some money. Just like if you hand someone a $20 bill for something and they run away. However, no one is getting into your entire wallet as long as you are using a trusted wallet, or manage your own keys, and don't give out the info to access your coins. The system is better, but more responsibility is on the individual to use it. 
Remember, someone has to take on the responsibility of managing your money, you want a centralized bank to do it, I want to do it myself and avoid all of the headaches that you seem to be fine with, different strokes.
@_date: 2015-12-16 03:19:50
A commodity is just something real and finite that can be used for something real (in real world processes). So long as forms of computers are real, and electricity/batteries are real, and the internet is real, Bitcoin is real. Paper currency is real too just like bank account numbers are real, but they don't fit the finite part of the definition, Bitcoin does similarly to Gold and Silver (and even those could become less scarce if we begin asteroid mining and things like that, unlike Bitcoin). The real world processes for Bitcoin are: it's a currency(can be moved, and damn easily), it's a scarce commodity(can store value), it has an accurate and unchangeable ledger to track all transactions, it's a communication tool which can be built into and alongside other real world processes, etc.
People like to say that currency is defined as a system of value exchange which must be issued by a country. That last part is a nonsense stipulation, and really only helps to try and cement the concept that a currency needs to have some kind of controller, and according to our collective primitive minds, that means the alpha male/the elder's council/the king/the kingdom/the republic/the democracy/the president/the country/the federal reserve. Well, Bitcoin offers a non-biased, non-power hungry, and essentially automatic controller, and the controller is restricted from printing an infinite amount, but it can also be divided into infinite denominations which gives it flexibility and precision in payment. It can also be used as a form of exchange. It's a currency as well as a commodity.
@_date: 2015-12-03 16:49:37
Not really, it's just expanding on technology. I'm saying the blockchain doesn't only need to be used for currency purposes. I'm also saying bitcoin is going to be fine as far as I can tell.
Nothing they do could change the core functionality of bitcoin, especially the decentralized aspect, so they can brand their products however they like.

Decentralization always has a place, it's a strategy to be used at certain times. It's a strategy to try and render centralized systems powerless. And in my opinion, with the state of the world right now, decentralization is in order. The decentralization problems of bitcoin are nothing compared to the centralization problems that the rest of the world is plagued by right now.

It's possible that a high level of decentralization is only needed when bitcoin is in an infancy stage, this is to protect it from the corrupted, old, crusty, pus filled, inefficient systems that currently dominate our world. The decentralized effect is a similar phenomenon to Terrorism if you think about it, it's the best strategy to slowly but surely chink away at the defenses, psychology, and resources of extremely powerful entities. Decentralization is a smoke screen, and it functions like a disease. 
I believe that Bitcoin will not succeed if it is highly decentralized forever. But it must not become more centralized until it is the most powerful entity or on the way of becoming it.
Bitcoin is not going to be the end all, be all, for all eternity even if it succeeds beyond our wildest imaginations. It will follow the same long term boom, bust cycles of the universe, which intertwines decentralization and centralization. It will have its good and its evil, and eventually its death. The only thing that matters for the progress of humanity, though, is higher highs and higher lows.
@_date: 2015-12-27 18:29:00
It's not black and white. There can be centralization within a decentralized system. There can also be decentralization in a centralized system. The level of decentralization that bitcoin achieves without creating complete chaos is the amazing beauty of it, but nothing like this can be maintained forever without centralization creeping in at certain areas. It's not a bad thing, it's just nature. Bitcoin will be fine until there is some truly bad news.
@_date: 2015-09-21 23:30:10
imo it's better for the currency as a whole if the business owner actually 
recieves bitcoin as payment, that would 
require the business to accept and manage bitcoin willingly, though. But quickly exchanging by having a service take your bitcoin and a fee in order to hand the business owner usd doesn't seem like the it would promote much growth, from a structural perspective.

If a service/process can be automated and completely decentralized, the empire centralized around that service/process dies, there's nothing they can do to make us need them in the future, younger generations certainly have no remorse about this.

The good thing about this ecosystem I think is that it can change itself very quickly depending on what the people want and decide to fund. Governments and Alliances can make laws, and big companies can comply with those laws, and all it takes is enough people saying "nah fuck that", ignoring the law and withdrawing support by not using the service. Companies lose profit, then they can fight with regulators until they make it suit the people while other services that are already ignoring the regulation reap benefits. Any regulation is inherently mitigated by the spread of this decentralized system, and there's always a way around with consensus.
