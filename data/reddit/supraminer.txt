Also, they have embarassingly stalled on implementing namecoin. After they promised to implement it ***[~5 months ago in this reddit comment](
Ater taking the time to implement coins like auroracoin, fluttercoin, etc. Wow, looks like a really shitty company if you ask me.
I would never take a selfie to verify my identity. That is just plain dumb.
What purpose do they propose that this method is a valid form of authentication? How do they plan to authenticate you in the future because of it?

...but you do require a selfie to become verified. And one cannot withdraw funds without being verified.
Thus, **you require a selfie to withdraw ones funds.**

Another battle for another day.
That, too is an invasion of privacy. A gaping one. But the government has guns and vos does not. So it's easier to get them to stop implementing their ridiculous policies, as we the community just did here it seems: 
OP was uncapable of taking a picture if I am not mistaken. He didn't own a camera.
That and the religious problems he pointed out are serious flaws in their security protocol imho.
@_date: 2014-07-17 04:31:19
That's a good enough reason as any not to use a certain Bitcoin exchange imho.
If somebody hung up on the phone on me when they owed me $20k... I would be more than a little upset like OP.

Anybody can deposit coins and convert them to fiat.
At which point you demand a selfie to withdraw the fiat.
Stop lying.
@_date: 2014-07-17 17:26:01
Again... that's ridiculous. I haven't gotten "today's newspaper" for like 6 years now. They hardly exist anymore.

I think I just found a new word for that band of bastards and their chubby king! Thanks!
@_date: 2014-07-17 17:48:20
Good point.
Even phrasing it originally like "for identity verification purposes, please show us a picture of your face" would probably have gone over much better.
I still probably would have objected though, personally.
@_date: 2014-07-17 04:36:20




Reminded me of this: 
@_date: 2014-07-17 17:14:19
I will log back into my VoS account later today and re-deposit if I am indeed verified... again.
I think the lesson to be learnt here is this:
Don't tell somebody you will do business with them one day, and not the next... just because somebody else ripped you off. That doesn't make any sense.
"Yea... bob... I know we've known eachother for a long time... but tom stole from me the other day, so I can't trust you anymore."
That kind of logic doesn't sit well with anybody, I would imagine.
@_date: 2014-07-02 03:48:50

It edited it's comment to include an article that was actually quite hilarious.

Just uhhh.. send us your panties OP... Again... As we need to verify your scent...
@_date: 2014-07-17 04:29:23
I don't care.
I'm only withdrawing from a bitcoin exchange that does not require a selfie.
And I would only suggest that my parents use the same as well. If I had to explain to my parents exactly what a selfie was or how to take one properly I would probably shoot myself.

So why did you only remove the selfies after a public outcry yesterday then?
Is the public managing your business or are you?
For all you know everybody posting in the previous thread and in here are a bunch of scammers just waiting for you to drop your perfect selfie-encrypted security platform. I am somewhat serious here.

This video is pretty frightening to be honest: 
Considering what the U.S. media has told us about gadaffi.
He seems fairly calm and collective. Bright, even.
Not insane as the media portrayed him to be.
@_date: 2014-07-17 17:46:42
They also promised to add Namecoin about 5 months ago... claiming it was coming in a week or two... and then never bothered to implement it: 
There's an entire real community there that they have alienated for months. Not sure why either.

ING/tangerine (a canadian Bank) does not require to see you in the flesh before providing you with an account.
Google Checkout/PayPal/Every-other-online-payment-system does not require a selfie or to see you in the flesh either.

What's wrong with the mennonites? I quite like their tables and honey to be honest.
All mennonites collectively choose not to have their pictures taken.
And the graven images bit refers to basically all catholics/christians... which is a few billion people the last time I checked... just most of them aren't devout believers.
