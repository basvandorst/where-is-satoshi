That probably creates more trouble than it solves. It is safer to use a live CD that is not intended to generate wallets.

That's actually hilarious.

Technically, you don't need roads to leave the country.

Seems like I did not make my point clear. I assume you have a basic understanding of economics. It is tempting to view the Bitstamp orderbook as everything that is above the intersection between the supply and demand curve. This is NOT the case.


I don't know who claims otherwise. It's just that you need AT LEAST $XY to buy all "available" bitcoins. Although it is open for discussion which bitcoins are actually available etc.

I don't think this will happen. The reason why it's possible with fiat money is that you have "one legal framework" corresponds to "one currency" (more or less). Fortunately, the US is not the only country in the world. For that reason alone your "black coins" will stay legitimate without convertion---there are enough economically strong countries that won't actively support the US efforts.

LOL. sorry

There you have it. Cannot crush the current system if the alternative is too complicated to use/understand.

In the current network, that's impossible. You have to have physical proximity to the antennas. As soon as you connect to one, the carrier knows you approximate location.

how do you define 'volunatry' here? are you a voluntary citizen if you were born there?

I'd say storing your stuff in a bank seems pretty off-site to me unless you live in that very bank.
@_date: 2014-08-28 13:44:13
I understand your concerns, but it is not as easy as that. There are many, many checks done by people in traditional networks (Visa, mastercard etc.) like fraud analysis that are not necessary for Bitcoin. It's hard to quantify the "waste" you are talking about, if any.

You explain how the state MIGHT shrink. It is reasonable that this could happen. I don't argue against it. However, you then already assume the conclusion: the state shrinks until it's gone. There are forces that counter the shrinkage (as others have mentioned, the "natural" need to enforce private property, for example). On top of that, there have been taxes before the age of fiat.
@_date: 2014-08-05 08:01:20
I think it's fair to assume that this is a requirement of Visa.

Honestly, that many people "predicting" a fundamental change in the world through bitcoin and the blockchain makes me think it's not actually going to happen.

I use mastercard and they give me exactly the rate I find online (is that "spot"?) They charge some forex fee though (&lt;1%), which is okay. I prefer that over hidden fees.

Woulda coulda shoulda. Plus they still have your meta-info (who are you and who are you calling). It would be ideal to not have any name registered to the sim-card, but that's just a dream nowadays (at least in Europe it's fairly to get a prepaid card without a name tied to it)
@_date: 2014-06-25 11:21:46
I see your point. I am not sure if there is any way to prove or disprove this. In my mind, there are so many things that could go wrong for adoption not to happen. Think of smartphones. The technology has been there for many years, but regular people just wouldn't use those nerdy things until Apple came along. I am not convinced that it is reasonable to predict that someone comes along and finds a solution. It *seemed* straight-forward, but it was not.
@_date: 2014-07-16 10:01:04
Can you write more about it? I find that there are too few reviews online. Which one are you most happy with? As far as I found out, you cannot use the IBAN for payments, is that correct? (for example, phone plans sometimes require IBANs)

Turns out you don't understand how the bitcoin price forms neither. The bitstamp order book is by no means a representation of the "real" demand and supply of bitcoins. Temporarily, you would shift the price to $1000/BTC, but not for more than a few days maybe, if at all. People react to a buy-off like that; this is NOT represented in the orderbook.
Ninja edit: market cap is not a stupid metric. It tells you something that is true about how people value bitcoin. If the price is $X and there are Y bitcoin in use, then as a matter of fact, the total valuation has to be $X*Y. If it were lower, people would sell bitcoin until the price drops. If it were higher, people would buy bitcoin until the price rises.

Wrong, it is the only reasonable assumption until proven otherwise. We can only know that another option works if we have an example of it working, period. This is not to say that we should not strive for something better.

You do not seem to have a very solid understanding of economics. The tax portion of your income is free to allocate after taxes are nil. How much the employer and employee gets, depends on the elasticities (for the employee how badly he needs the income and for the employer how easy it is to replace the employee). If the employee's supply is perfectly inelastic, sure, the employeer gets to keep the income.

Implicitly, you have a say in it, as in "how valuable(irreplacable) are your skills to your employer". If you were the only person to do the task that is needed by the employer for the business to work, you would get 100% of the "savings". Needless to say, most people do not have skills that valuable.

If you assume the person in question is a retard that cannot stand up for himself and is not willing to leave the company, you're right. Obviously, the people who "suffer" most is the ones who, for example, already work the same job for decades without any wage increases worth speaking of.
Are you trying to communicate that it is *difficult* to negotiate, that the economy is really *bad* and that life is *hard*? Well, I am not trying to deny that. But I am not going to ignore limitations that companies have either.

I really don't like the project, as it makes lacks transparency.
@_date: 2014-06-25 10:50:27


It might or might not. That's my point, humans are very bad at predicting whether a technology will actually have a profound impact.
@_date: 2014-08-25 14:06:15
Does it?
