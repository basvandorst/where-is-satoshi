Imagine trying to get Microsoft in the 80s to let their devs wear Brony t-shirts to work, show up at 11am, serve them free meals everyday, and let them play Starcraft and ping pong. Yeah, no. 
Now they have to in order to compete with Google and everybody else.

Most people would probably still consider Bitcoin a hassle at this point, but education is improving and usability is trending upward all the time.

It's 1993 and this 56 kbps internet system will hardly make the existing model obsolete.

Bakkt is 2 weeks old lol

Baakt already does more volume than the CME and it's hyped because BTC is actually physically delivered and they provide custody. Institutional custody and better tax treatment (for long side especially) are a legit reason for institutions and traders to actually use Baakt that don't exist for CME.

Not sure you can really say this with much certainty. This market could get nuts overnight in either direction. 
Even within the next 2 years, off-chain protocol developments like lighting or on-chain swaps find meaningful adoption, you might have insane amounts of trading done in dark pools and you could have the price hit below $1k and above $100k on the same day.

I probably would never use this system, but maybe someday I'd want to move millions of dollars worth of Bitcoin and maybe it would be worth the peace of mind to have this one transaction be idiot-proof.

It's because some traders would rather be in cash when not actively trading and not exposed to Bitcoin volatility.

I mean, there's a reason you used the word 'plenty' and not something stronger like 'most.' Part of the reason the elderly are targeted is reduced cognitive function. This is obvious.

This is false. The methods used to catch Ross had nothing to do with Bitcoin.
He using a misconfigured hidden service that leaked its own IP address and accidentally revealed his email on a forum asking technical questions. He got ganked by the malware militia at NSA/FBI and they probably constructed all the evidence we know about in parallel to hide their not-exactly-legal-but-FISA-so-fuck-you methods.

The US authorizes drone strikes to kill people based on metadata. Communications' metadata can tell you almost everything you need to know about a person.

Yeah but they (likely) got his IP in the first place by just breaking in to his server indiscriminately and then constructed the other stuff to present to the court to make it more palatable. 
Also, the murder for hiring thing was never proven or attempted to be proven in court.

Hashrate generally follows price, not leads it

1) good luck stopping it
2) jurisdictional competition. If the US bans Bitcoin all the devs, businesses, and tax money goes to Europe and Asia

Actually it's even deeper than that
