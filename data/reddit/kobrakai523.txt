I'd say an amputation is in order

On the contrary, the daily show exists in response to the deterioration of American debate brought about by right wing jackassery.

I never anticipated "pandemonium" or "disaster." I did think transactions would take increasingly longer, and that appropriate fees might be tricky to calculate, and that there might be a loss of confidence and talent in the Bitcoin realm. Those things have happened, unnecessarily, in my opinion. Why the increase in Bitcoin value these last few days if there's a loss of confidence, you ask? I would say it's in spite of that deterioration, and we would be in a far better place than this had it not occurred. I love Bitcoin. I hold more Bitcoin than my wife would approve of. I desperately want to see it succeed. I just don't subscribe to the direction we're headed down, and it's frustrating to watch. So sometimes I lash out here with sarcasm... it's cathartic. So bear with me. 
P.S. I think coinbase is awesome, and good for Bitcoin. I don't believe coinbase assassinated jfk from a grassy knoll...

Coinbase can't win with you guys. You think they're negatively impacted by increased value in Bitcoin? I've never had anything but good experiences with them.

Funny, I was promised a Segwit in April!

You're like the dude that disproved global warming by bringing a snowball to the senate floor. Can't argue with logic like that!
