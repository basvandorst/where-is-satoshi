Math time! Not criticizing just doing the math for anyone else interested. 
Assuming only one transaction per month(the one rent payment). 
For $300 to be less than 1% of the rent, then the monthly rent would have to be $30,000. 
My guess is that the per-transaction option will be preferred.

Their website says the service is free...

Keep in mind, this should not be reason to trust them completely.
It's possible they're just building up people's trust before disappearing with their money.
However, in my case, they *did* perform as expected and &lt;3 days after sending them 0.02 BTC, I was sent 0.0316 BTC for a profit of 0.0116 BTC.

You're username.
Dear god man, you're username.
Fucking Brilliant.
Edit: to all the downvoters
1. I'm sincerely sorry for making an off-topic comment. I understand now that it was the wrong thing to do and I wont do it again, promise.
1. I'm aware I was using the wrong form of "your". It was supposed to be a joke about OP's username *also* using the wrong form of "your". I take it the joke was either not at all funny, or in horribly bad taste.

glad someone else noticed
The charts on bitcointy went flat and then when I tried to reload the gox I got a "502 bad gateway error"
so is the surge over now?

Update: The transaction went through while I was in bed.
I take full responsibility for crashing mtGox with my epic 0.5BTC deposit.

I'm such a coward.
OP has -450 comment karma but I still trust his FUD over my own better judgement.

Pun intended? I giggled.

I had no idea such a thing was possible! I always assumed you had to meet a stanger in a public place to make the transaction. I avoided it because that seemed super sketchy.
Escrow FTW!
