So much of that is wrong. It hasn’t been a slow rise up. 
Bitcoin dominance has only be going up. Fundamentals should have told him that lol. 
Here is my prediction I’ve been consistent with. Bitcoin needed to go up to then go down. This will kill off the alts.
@_date: 2019-03-07 17:31:31
Bitcoin will hit 8400. But this ain’t the bottom. 
@_date: 2019-03-07 18:32:08
You’re part of it now. 
Looks like doing the opposite of the majority in November worked out for you. 
@_date: 2019-03-08 20:32:59
The issue is how aggressive it is when it breaks the trend. This has been a very attractive climb since the spike on March 5th. 
I have a feeling when it breaks it will drop to the mid February price levels. 
@_date: 2019-03-05 01:29:25
I wouldn’t fear that. There is no telling what all time highs could be. I think long term should be great. That and FOMO would be 10 fold next time around. 
@_date: 2019-03-07 17:30:52
That doesn’t change we are limited to buy fiat. I believe in bitcoin and have already invested more money that I ever thought I would. Hodl is a safe plan for the longterm.  
Shorting bitcoin allows me to increase my coin count. My only goal is increasing coin count. Price isn’t relevant in 2019. If anything lower is better. 
@_date: 2019-03-07 15:46:25
Gonna be a no for me dawg. 
@_date: 2019-03-07 17:52:51
It has to be the actual bottom before it’s the bottom. I’m sure you thought the bottom was 6000 like everyone else also.  The price also had a nice bounce off 6000 2 months later back up to 8500. In sure you thought that was the start of the bull market like everyone else.
I’ll continue to think the opposite of the majority. Last time I check the majority isn’t rich. 
@_date: 2019-03-03 22:33:38
I’m for it lol. 
@_date: 2019-03-08 15:09:45
Just saying people are making businesses to offer buying bitcoin. 
People are lazy. I’ve spent the last two years studying cryptos, currencies, and charting. I still have years to of learning to go. People will always lineup for someone else to make them money. 
The post was confusing and I couldn’t understand what he was crying about. The business or the promised profits. 
@_date: 2019-03-02 00:16:01
Agreed. These scams and shit coins will fail. Give it time. Bitcoin will bring them down once it gets low enough. Then it will rise from the ashes. 
@_date: 2019-03-05 17:12:07
We haven’t broken the current downtrend. You’d need to break the trend. I shorted at 4089. Still above water here. 
Ohhhh, you’re one of those guys that assumes any green equals moon. My bad. Just ignore what I said. Let me know if you need recommendations for a Lambo. 
@_date: 2019-03-08 18:08:04
I’ll let you explain to me how being ruthless is relevant to making sound investments lol. 
And no offense I’m not needing your fiat. 
@_date: 2019-03-07 18:52:28
I agree we are going up. I just see all these scams and don’t see a way bitcoin hold any gains. I think it will get uglier before it gets better.
Either way I’m in the game lol. I say it a lot but my motto is error on the side of down until it shows otherwise.
@_date: 2019-03-18 12:35:53
You’re paying a fee to use their equipment. It’s weird how many bitcoin supporters dream about a non regulated world that also survives without profit.
@_date: 2019-03-05 15:47:10
We are in a long term and an intermediate downward trend. Price doesn’t move in a straight line. You’ll have plenty more times to buy under today’s prices 
@_date: 2019-03-05 16:07:26
The good news is one of our comments will age terribly. 
Bitcoin continues to stay within these trends. We are now 14 months into this downtrend. 14 months would classify as longterm for me. We are also still in a down trend dating back from November. Those 6k prices everyone thought was the bottom. 
It might have hit bottom. Last summer I switched my trading view to assume it’s dropping until it proves us otherwise. I was losing money when I shared your views. I’ve been making some nice profits now. Wake me up when we break any of these downtrends. 
@_date: 2019-03-05 16:48:13
Lol not in bitcoin right now and up for 2019. Why would I stay awake? 
I still have to invest .1 bitcoin for this month. I’ll wait for it to drop to save me some fiat. Would you like me to update you with the price I buy at later in the month? 
@_date: 2019-03-07 17:05:00
Bitcoin looks like it could have an upward bounce, but it’s not getting to $6300 lol. It’s not going much over 4K if it does bounce. 
I’m starting to think we will get a short term bounce before the bottom falls out again to the 3400 price range. 
@_date: 2019-03-08 17:19:48
I said a few friends and myself. Missing the “people” I’m going to scam you’re talking about. Just 5 successful dudes from different industries pissing money into a fund we can afford to lose. 
It’s 2019 lol. We want to handle people’s money eventually, but that isn’t today(2021ish). I’ll be managing OUR fund with OUR money. I’m successful in the business world, have a degree in Economics, and care about people. If I wanted to scam people I would have went into the banking industry. 
@_date: 2019-03-08 14:40:38
Lol at manipulation. I’m no whale and am able to analysis the charts just fine. People think it’s manipulation every time it drops. 
Nearly every altcoin is a scam or shit. There are billions of dollars invested in hundreds of shot projects that will go under when the recession hits. Bitcoin can’t grow when people are fine investing in crap like ripple. 
Markets are alive. It will weed out the weak. Plenty of idiots still thinking they are going to wake up millionaires over night. Bitcoin is as close to true capitalism as you can get. 
Remember to be happy though. We all get paid in Fiat. When bitcoin is green you’re losing money. You want your default currency to win at this time. 
@_date: 2019-03-04 21:46:25
Well it’s number one appeal is wealth...... if not people wouldn’t be investing in all these scam altcoins. 
@_date: 2019-11-19 19:06:03
Probably dumping since we are obviously in a bear market....
@_date: 2019-03-05 18:14:35
Do me a favor and don’t delete your comments after the bottom falls out again. 
I could easily be wrong but I have reasons for why I make my decisions. A lot smarter than blindly assuming 14 months of downward movement is over every time bitcoin has a 4% gain. 
I got out at 4089. Bitcoin has a little bit to go before I look dumb for my last trade. 
@_date: 2019-03-08 03:14:51
This is why you invest in bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-03-08 21:06:26
Yep I agree. Bitcoins movement after its March 5 spike has looked really nice. I’m still fearful if it breaks downward it’s going to keep moving. It is nice seeing a clean steady climb. 
I shorted in the 4100 area. I’d feel a lot better if bitcoin could get back to those levels. I don’t think I’m the only one that shorted in the 4000-4200 area. The longer it reject 4000 the more it sells me on a downward correction. 
@_date: 2019-03-08 16:20:47
I agree. I’m hoping to see a nice drop also. 
Hopefully it breaks through the 200 hour average on the way down. 
@_date: 2019-03-07 22:34:46
It has way too much resistance to jump to 6k right now. We need to see it hold above 4K first. 
@_date: 2019-03-08 14:43:51
Bitcoin has no company and provides the hardest form of money ever. 
I wonder what ATT thought after they decided Cell Phones were a niche market. I assume the same feeling people will have for not seeing the  value of bitcoin. 
@_date: 2019-03-08 15:00:38
We are still inside the same upward channel since 05 March 19 and the 50 hour moving average is now aligned with the bottom of the channel. I’m thinking we pull back to the 200 hour average sometime between now and the weekend. I wouldn’t be shocked to see it to break down lower when it hits that’s average. 
Might not be right. Just including what I see. 
@_date: 2019-03-04 21:45:15
It’s been trending down since January 2018. It’s going to continue to drop. Alts aren’t good for bitcoin. It will bleed them out. Just give it time and start accumulating. 
I get paid in fiat. Anytime bitcoin is in the red that’s green to me. Y’all must get paid in bitcoin lol. 
@_date: 2019-03-08 13:52:33
I’m in the process of starting a crypto fund. Nothing major. Just few successful friends of mine and myself to start. I’m hoping to have it all up and running by this summer. 
Anyone promising a high rate of return is scamming people.
@_date: 2019-11-27 14:01:23
I like to diversify my investments.
@_date: 2019-03-07 13:14:11
Idiots like this are why bitcoin will continue its drop. It has to weed out all these idiots. Bitcoin won’t reach new highs when scams like XRP are still around. 
2019 will be the year of ALT’s going under. After that Bitcoin will only climb. 
@_date: 2019-03-04 22:02:46
We very well could have. I changed my outlook last summer to assume it drops until proven otherwise. I also do some TA but admit I factor in my view of it continuing to drop. 
I accumulate as much as I can but it’s typically around .1 bitcoin a month plus my bonuses. Hoping to have purchased 10 bitcoin by the end of the year. Slightly off pace at these price levels, but not horrible. I am green for 2019 so that’s a positive. 
@_date: 2019-08-02 12:46:09
Why did you highlight the thumbs up?
@_date: 2019-02-24 20:28:29
Sell before drops. Buy in after drop. 
@_date: 2019-02-25 13:05:56
This is wrong. We are still in an aggressive monthly decline. This trend is going to hold stronger than a break from a minor resistance level on hourly charts. Prices rejected 4K. There is a lot more resistance above the 4k also. 
The climb to 6k will require holding down at these levels for a while. I assume we will drop to new lows though. 
@_date: 2019-02-25 12:54:24
I have the bottom around $2,200 ish. Sometime between March and July. 
@_date: 2019-02-25 14:33:28
Or I spend my free time studying charting, currencies, and listening to established analyst. I might not be right, but I at least have reasoning for my thinking. 
I blindly followed the FOMO policy for the first half of 2018 and lost a ton. My conservative approach has kept all my new investments in the green. 
I sold at 4085 on 2/23 after riding bitcoin up from 3939 on 2/21. I sold 3645 on 2/8 after buying in at 3455 on 2/8. Those are my 2 moves for February. 
I’m green for February. It’s weird how the more time I invest educating myself the less I lose. 
@_date: 2019-02-18 23:42:17
Lol. Do you realize there is actual math to a lot of this? Markets have to recover after a bubble. Bitcoin isn’t any different. Bitcoin won’t run until it kills off the altcoins. It kills of the altcoins by continuing to drop. 
@_date: 2019-02-25 21:15:51
Yep. It’s a bear market, statistically the price is breaking through more supports than resistance. I’ll gladly sell high and buy back in higher if the price is moving towards a new higher resistance that is profitable for me. 
Better than buy high and sell low. 
@_date: 2019-02-18 23:56:53
I’m not saying it can’t jump up. We can have another bubble anytime. People are stupid. All these altcoins are shit but yet people are pissing millions into them. A 6% daily jump has people forgetting months of down lol. 
Anyone with basic charting knowledge can figure out what trend the price is going from a weekly chart. But hey, Lambos. 
People wouldn’t downvote drop predictions if the market had a long term outlook. A large majority of people on here think they are going to wake up rich tomorrow lol. I’m way more excited to see red than green. 
@_date: 2019-02-22 21:28:11
Yes. Bitcoin will be much more valuable when compared to fiat, but it won’t be a victim of hyper inflation. It’s a store of value. It will put checks on monetary expansion policy by the government. 
The price of food to percentage of bitcoin will stay the same. 
@_date: 2019-02-24 20:38:48
Yeah. Sell your bitcoin to someone before it goes down..... how can y’all not understand basic economics? 
Regardless of your view of fiat, it is stable. You have a stable market to secure funds during the drops. If you believe in it long term just hodl. I believe it in for the longterm so understand how valuable it is to increase your total bitcoin count. I make a fixed salary. That’s why shorting it works nice. 
At worse you are more educated in the market.

We can’t get anyone to run our terminals in California. It’s crazy people choose to live in a state that gives zero fucks about it’s citizens. 
I vote California should become its own nation. 
@_date: 2019-02-25 14:17:39
We haven’t crossed 6,400 lol. Still a downtrend on the monthly. We haven’t crossed 4178 so still a down trend on the weekly. 
Price doesn’t move flat. Wake me up when bitcoin breaks some of these long term resistance lines. 
@_date: 2019-02-26 13:35:44
I work for a freight company. One of the perks is you can pretty much pick any where you want to live. We service all of US and Canada. My company can’t get people to go to California. 
It’s typically a pay cut because of taxes, labor laws are crazy strict, and environmental laws hurt profitability. It’s twice the work and stress for less pay. 
The Southeast is the most requested area. High salaries, low taxes, and low cost of living. 
I was being sarcastic about California leaving. It was funny watching people in California threaten leaving and the whole country saying good, leave lol. 
@_date: 2019-02-25 15:37:58
When will it or when did it bottom? How long with accumulation period be before we can see new all time highs? 
I assume you have these answers since you can figure out how unlikely my analysis is. I will probably be wrong, but I have rules and reasonings to justify my future trades. I’ll continue to say it will drop until it shows it can hold gains. 6k is a long way to go and we aren’t “booming” until we can accumulate at that level. I think we have to accumulate in the 3ks for a while before we can get to 6k. 
Might be wrong. Not telling you to invest. Just posting what I see. 
@_date: 2019-02-24 15:41:50
Bitcoin hasn’t left its downtrend yet.... 
I look forward to the next time we are up 10% and everyone screams for the moon again. 
@_date: 2019-02-25 15:22:10
You say this but I’ve somehow went from losing money to making a profit, candlestick analysis is hundreds of years old lol. I do have an Econ degree, but I’m self taught with trading.  I do follow the same rules that Economics taught me. "reject both theory without evidence and evidence without theory." Let the charts dictate your heirs, 
TA allows you to identify key resistance and trends. I sell when the price gets stuck at a resistance. In a bear market it is better to error on the side of down.   
Every TA agreed LTC would hit major resistance at 54 dollars. Anyone that didn’t sell when it was around that level should have. Error on the side of down. Price bounces between resistance and support. 
@_date: 2019-02-26 13:52:43
What are people thinking on the charts today? 
We are about to approach resistance for the downward trend started back in the 23rd. 50 and 200 SMAs are about to meet also. 
@_date: 2019-02-25 17:44:08
Big players use TA when making moves. They don’t blindly dump lol. 
I get out near resistance levels. If price breaks that resistance and gets to a certain point I buy back in. If I was a whale I’d dump at a resistance, not randomly. 
I’m not trying to sell you on anything. I spend most my free time studying technical analysis now. If I’m going to have money in something I want to understand it. 
It’s a free market. If there is a dump you should have a stop loss set. Mine are very conservative. If it is triggered by a whale then you’ll have opportunities to ride it back up when it corrects. 
@_date: 2019-02-15 21:53:52
That’s what I like with long term bitcoin predictions. Bitcoin won’t be compared to today’s fiat. I don’t k ow what a bitcoin will be worth compared to the future world currencies that are coming lol.

Transaction fees are worth convenience. There is cost to doing business. I can’t wait to try one out. 
@_date: 2019-02-18 14:07:04
Make sure to take your gains. Going to hurt worse when it comes back down if not. 
@_date: 2019-02-24 15:52:30
Bitcoin is still in a bear market. Any technical analysis can tell you this...But it’s manipulation lol. I’m a 28 year dude that works a career and numerous other crap. I still was able to get out a 4100. I drive a Nissan, I’m no whale. 
@_date: 2019-02-15 22:36:52
Your Keynesian views are from the 30s and are from a guy that wasn’t an economist. I have have an Econ degree from a university that teaches classical economics. I’d love to here your reasoning. 
The funny part is your second part about a fixed supply.  Anyone that has taken a single Econ class can figure out what happens to the price when there is a fixed amount of something. Typically fixed items have high price tags with them. 
Now what happens to the price of a currency when there isn’t a fixed supply? The supply is always increasing. Supply and demand have an indirect relationship. This is proven, not theory. As supply increases prices will drop. The value of the dollar continues to drop. 
Real life example Diamonds. If increasing supply was good they wouldn’t control release diamonds to keep the price high. Somehow diamonds are crazy expensive with such a limited supply policy. Gold to the US dollar should also prove this to you. Gold increases around 2% each year. The CPI says the dollar only inflates 2% each year on average. Why has the dollar lost 96% of its purchasing power when compared to a much more fixed item like gold? 
Increasing the money supply and debt continue to create a larger and larger income gap. Austrian economist Murray Rothbard predicted in the 70s that people would turn to socialism after government monetary policy got too far out of hand. It’s weird how these Austrian economist predictions are so accurate. My favorite counter argument about Austrian business cycles is that it assumes banks will make bad investments. Banks would never make bad investments..... except the housing market crash lolz.

The last 12 months have convinced me. 
@_date: 2019-02-25 15:09:36
I buy .01 bitcoin each month regardless of price for now lol. I’m for it long term as well. I believe if you own 10 BTC you’ll be rich one day. 
I short with the intention of obtaining more BTC. I will stick with this until we are out of the bear market. 
@_date: 2019-02-15 21:35:32
There was a major bubble and will take a long time of sideways moving before it can recover. It’s not hitting highs for a couple years lol.
The longer it drops the more you can profit longterm. I can only put a fixed amount of US dollars into bitcoin. The price increasing doesn’t help me. It decreases my purchasing power. 
@_date: 2019-02-24 15:45:59
Yep. You make money predicting the direction of the market. 
Downward moves are a better opportunity to get more bitcoin. 
If a bitcoin could be worth 100k one year why would you want it to go up to 6k right now lol? I get paid in fiat. I benefit when fiat is wining against bitcoin. 
@_date: 2019-02-18 23:39:25
I’ll take some lower than 3300. 
@_date: 2019-04-08 15:49:45

@_date: 2019-04-08 13:20:47
Same. Good news for the bears. 
@_date: 2019-04-08 13:19:01
I think people shorting are assuming we will get rejected by the upward trend line formed in early February. There isn’t a lot of support to hold the price up if a downward move starts. 
Everyone should be conservative right now. Take gains and hope for a drop. 
@_date: 2019-04-08 15:33:23
Sometime between today and tomorrow. 
@_date: 2019-04-08 16:05:07
Same here. Apparently we are the only ones that get paid in fiat. 
@_date: 2019-04-08 13:49:08
TA is pretty obvious but people still reject it. It doesn’t guarantee an outcome but does a great job showing points of interest. If price breaks through that point it will keep climbing. If it rejects it it will go down hard. 
We should know sometime between today and tomorrow. 
@_date: 2019-04-11 14:39:45
Bitcoin is a way to store value. Fiat will never be replaced nor would you want to transact in bitcoin.
