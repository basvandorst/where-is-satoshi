And that's the problem with bitcoin.  It's no different than a fiat currency. 
@_date: 2018-08-18 17:15:50
Haha no that means to avoid it more. Bitcoin was never intended to function this way.  You don't say it recognized by the federal government or ETF. You folks are just giving in to the system you've tried to rebuke.

This comic is stupid. It forgets the two are equivalent. You'd be paying the same exorbitant price
@_date: 2017-03-11 03:04:24
That seems like good news. I don't understand this big push for an ETF. It makes no sense 
@_date: 2017-03-03 16:23:46
No that is not great news. I think people have lost site of the original intention of Bitcoin. It was a method of payment devoid from the American dollar, Wall Street and financial system. Having it integrated into the Federal Reserve (a private corporation) is a terrible idea.

The whole point of Bitcoin is to be an alternative currency. Why would the users vote to integrate it into Wall Street? This would not be good it in the long term.

All your Bitcoin are belong to us? I dunno  just don't see this as a win

Still seems like the wrong direction to go. Not sure that I'd trust them considering how lacking the rest of technology is at the firm.

This is not a good thing despite what it might seem like. The Congressman had good intentions with tb  caucus but now this gives him the power to regulate and makes laws regarding Bitcoin.  It will now become more of government's property.

How is that true? I didn't realize the site itself accepted credit card payments. Couldn't the individuals still use something like Square?

What about a company or a bank?  When does the data that moves between a bank and a civilian have to remain encrypted?  I suppose the FBI wants to personally reimburse everyone whose ever gotten their financials hacked.

So the original poster had to pay you post an ad on the?

You already lost me on fiat currency being fungible?
Really people don't value different denominations different?  
@_date: 2019-01-22 15:47:44
It's not entirely wrong. Again that's your opinion. I struggle to justify Bitcoin's existence let alone it's price. It's not something that I can fathom taking hold in our economy without becoming more and more like the dollar. I thought the idea behind Bitcoin was to be different; not like it's "predecessor"

What's to stop Amazon from seriously challenging Bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-01-11 13:57:10
Isn't the point to not be exactly like the current monetary system in place? 
@_date: 2019-01-11 13:22:36
If a bank kept Bitcoin in reserve that would be totally against the grain of the entire reason it was invented.
@_date: 2015-11-18 17:21:23
Seeing that statement makes me wonder if they are going to report things to the SEC.
@_date: 2017-06-12 17:59:29
And exactly how does Bitcoin plan not to fall into the same trap and avoid the infinity problem?
