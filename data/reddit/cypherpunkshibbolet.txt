Transaction times are unreliable and unpredictable unless you send amounts that are big enough that you can afford to pay the fee. For transactions under 250 dollars bitcoin right now is way to expensive. And for what? Raise the god damn blocksize! We need a solution NOW! You see those dressed people pretending everything is fine just in the hope that they can save face with all their friends? If we all stop pretending that everything is fine then maybe we can fix this mess before it's to late. Or is everybody here such a fan of altcoins because there is one thing worse then an altcoin and that is a coin that is not even a coin because you can't do goddamn anything with unless you have like thousands of them. What kind of crap money is that? Jesus. I am fucking pissed! This is not what I signed up for. STOP FUCKIKNG PRETENDING LIKE EVERYTHING IS FINE.

if you want your first confirmation under 12 hours then it's about a 1000 right now. This is because people are attacking Bitcoin. When LN is here, this will not be possible anymore. Just a couple more months. 2018 is going to be great year for Bitcoin, me might see 100 000USD/ BTC! 
@_date: 2017-12-21 11:04:29
That is still way to low. Try a 1000 sat/B next time. Or wait a couple of months (maybe a bit longer) untill LN network fixes everything.

Those people are just buying bitcoin because the price is going up, not to use as a currency so as soon as the price goes down again the transactions will go away.

Liar, show the transaction!

I have been active in bitcoin since about the end of 2010. But I am done with at least bitcoin for now. You probably don't use bitcoin, but I do. And I can't use it anymore. It's not a good tool anymore. Slow and expensive. You can spin that however you want to but that is the reality.

We will hit 100 000K before the end of 2018. Mark my words! The bankers will shit themselves shitless. We might even bring down a couple of small corrupt nations in the coming 5 years. Paypal will become totally obsolete.

But he is correct though. You can easily transfer Bitcoin right now for only 2 - 5% fee and I don't think that is very expensive to use the most secure premium network in the world. Banks can always steal your money but with bitcoin this is impossible. That is why you pay a bit of money, otherwise miners would not mine bitcoin. 
It reminds me of when you get your car fixed and the garage can do it cheap and fast (bcash) but it will not be good. Or good and fast but it will not be cheap (bitcoin) or good and cheap but it will not be fast.

Maybe crypto is not for you? Bitcoin is not ment to spend on cofee and stuff. You need serious business.

1 mb is already to high. Luke-jr want to go to 300k, this will lower the  fees.

I have edited the parent comment with a message singed with a 2011 key, that's one I have easy access to right now on my laptop.

You mean you have customers doing direct banking with each other without bitfinex being involved as a way of routing around fiat banks trying to defend their turf? What happens when the balance between FIAT in and FIAT out is not 1 on 1 anymore. How much dollars does Bitfinex have? How much fiat bank accounts belonging to Bitfinex are frozen? So many questions. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 16:31:09
Oh that's good. So bitfinex has acces to regular banking again. Does this mean I can withdraw fiat that is not USD? 
@_date: 2017-11-06 07:08:23
Exactly, that's why the only solution to scaling bitcoin is sidechannels. That's so obvious I don't know why anybody does not see this.

This is we don't believe in smaller. Dirty big block bot, get out of here!

You should not relax at all because we know who you are [snubbe123](
And we are coming for your bitcoins. 
edit: You talk a lot about the game. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 12:08:21
THE game.

I was there (online) when somebody paid 10 000 bitcoin to have a pizza made and deliver it to his house. I was there when bitcoin first broke the 10 $ barrier and not to much longer the 100$ dollar barrier. I was also there when it dropped and when it dropped again and when it dropped again. Still going strong, but what a ride so far.

Because shares in companies bought with fiat money is completely different from how much gold you can find on the planet. Bitcoin was made to have some properties like gold, a fixed amount of it.  Apple and oranges.

I believe you Here on reddit we are all a bit more skeptical then the average person. And on ... well let's not start talking about that. I hope this 600$ dollars turn in to a small fortune for your daughter. Keep it save! (and make sure they end up on the right chain
