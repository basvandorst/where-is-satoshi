This is exactly how I feel. How does anyone get over such regret?

Guys, do I now just stop dealing with Bitcoins all other together in India?

The video is not available. Is there another mirror I can watch it on? I had the same concerns over Bitcoin being illegal, I read it in the paper yesterday.

My lack of awareness + hanging out with my friends who were mainly interested  in figuring out which girl had the biggest tits left me a broke man. 
 Deep Down I Know It's My Fault :(

Why would litecoin win against Bitcoin?

Duly noted. Thanks!

Hey guys, 
I recently dove into Bitcoin. The price of Bitcoin varies drastically in various countries. How can I take advantage of that and sell Bitcoin for a higher price in India? 
Is there a forum or a website where I can pay a person  $50- $100 over the market price. Depending on the price of the Bitcoin?

Ugh that sucks. I keep telling myself that I'm still early in the game.

Every time I read some story like this. I look up to the stars and shout " What have I done wrong?"

Long read. But worth it. I missed the $600 Bitcoin train. But I'm saving money little bit little and buying bits of Bitcoin. I know this is going to be huge. Billions of dollars can't be just wiped away in an instant. You said that we are early adopters, and that makes me a little hopeful that I might see some gains in the future.

I'm looking to take advantage of the Arbitrage opportunities too. Haven't looked into the legalities of it.

Interesting. I definitely need to do some work. Me being a crypto noob termed all alt coins as shit coins. If I make some clever investments the future may be bright :)

So he's probably a millionaire now.
