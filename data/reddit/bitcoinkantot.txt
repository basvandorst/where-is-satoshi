Sorry I'm confused. Are you talking about non-mining nodes vs mining nodes? What non-mining nodes can do that mining nodes can't and vice versa?
@_date: 2017-10-01 22:55:38

Watch your mouth boy, that's blasphemy you're talking about.
@_date: 2017-10-03 13:36:10
Wow that's great, almost 50% and I'm sure we will soon have the overwhelming majority! The miners foolishly thought having the most hash rate matters. Let's see if someone at all validates their useless mined coins. Non-mining nodes rules! 
@_date: 2017-10-02 00:52:19
Wow. Totally broken... ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
@_date: 2017-10-05 01:13:01
Thats not going to happen because we have total control of non-mining nodes as gatekeepers to thwart any competing ideas that will try to take away our total grasped of the network. 
How to fight the enemies of Bitcoin:
- Run your non-mining full node wallet to undermine the powerful hashrate of the evil miners. 
- Constantly harass and attack all enemies of Bitcoin listed in the NYA and force them to break their oath, stop attacking us, and instead join us. All for the good of Bitcoin.
- Wear a hat with  printed on them to grab further attention (not sure if it helps but it'll look cool just the same).
 Bitcoin November victory!  Yeah!✌️

Hey idiot, Segwit2x is the new consensus because 80+% of hash power backs it up. Read the white paper again you logical moron. The biggest Hash Power is consensus. How 'bout your uasf? 5% hash power? Wow. And your promoting that? More like a self-interest than a consensus to me.

Sure kekcoin aka Greg maxwell, we will do that.

@_date: 2017-06-23 17:04:25
You can feel all you like but uasf crowd should thank Barry for saving their faces from falling flat on the floor in Aug 1. Not to mention preventing a Sybil attack on Bitcoin.

Look at the message, not the messenger.
@_date: 2017-06-23 14:00:04
uasf has a small, tiny, microscopic, dust-sized (5 or 6%) hash power, in other words, it has no consensus. **No consensus = split**. Plain and simple. No conversation-gymnastics needed.
Segwit2x has over 80% hash power. Those who has the most hash power is the consensus. If any split happens that'll be the sorry 20% little minority --just like you.
@_date: 2017-06-24 06:07:19
Unlike ordinary cpu and gpu, Asic chips can't be turned off that easily. If you do that, it will 'literally' melt. Hence if there's a need to discard/replace or simply do some maintenance work on the asic chips its more sensible to run it continuesly until it stops on itself. This process creates/mines empty blocks. All mining pools mines empty blocks every once in awhile not because they want to but because they have to.

Idiot. The subject of the post and your replies doesn't match. Segwit2x is the new consensus because 80+% of hash rate says so. I'm saying this because its the truth, not because I'm a new redditor!

Im no coder but if I got it right, Jeff garzik talked about their difference: the usual segwit only prevents asicboost use inside segwit transactions, while segwit in segwit2x not only can prevent asicboost use inside segwit txns but also it can prevent asicboost use in transactions done in the 1mb regular blocks.
Again I'm no expert so correct me if I'm wrong.
@_date: 2017-06-26 07:35:21

Oh man, if uasf is harrasment to the miners, then powchange is a punch in the face! Do that and I think all the miners (including pro-segwit, pro-core, and the neutrals) will rebel against you. Why? Because you'll be messing up with their very hardware that cause millions to setup.
At least this is only my point of view, so correct me if i'm wrong.
@_date: 2017-06-24 07:24:48


Obviously you haven't been working yet inside a large mining facility. Anyway, its true and I don't have to convince anyone. What you said is also true. So there's no argument here. Cheers.
