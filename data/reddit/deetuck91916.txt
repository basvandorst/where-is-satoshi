I really sat here and watched it like I didn’t know how it was going to end. Excellent meme-ing.

Binance is a good option but new user registrations have been frozen temporarily. Bittrex is alright, but I’ve seen a few users comment about some difficulty with withdrawals.

If you wait for another dip you could be waiting forever and you’ll miss out on the gains between now and then.

Would having my bitcoins in a desktop wallet like Exodus work?

The only thing I saw about tampering with third party was a few months ago on the ledger thread that someone got one instructing him to use the pin “5555” and it had a bitcoin wallet app installed. The ceo responded saying to not put money on it and send him the info of the third party. 
Other than that I haven’t seen anything that caught my eye before buying it.

I love how many drunks there are in crypto land. Kudos to your story, I’m taking a shot for you and your family now.

Localbitcoins is probably one of the easier anonymous options from what I’ve read.

Nobody in this thread can tell you what’s going to happen. But we can definitely tell you we hope it continues to climb, and if it doesn’t we’re ready to buy.

I literally made an account after reading reddit posts for about 2 months just to tell you guys you had me wiping tears from laughter. Bravo. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:09:21
Why do you say that. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:35:17
Good luck.

Came to help but a few people above should’ve gotten it sorted out for you. Congrats on finding your moon! Live life to the fullest with your real close ones.

If the transaction does not go through the money will be returned to your wallet after some time.

I did not say I invested $8700. Just when a full bitcoin was that amount.
