They are talking about the Ponzi's Scheme of Bitcoin while using the symbol of Telegram:

I don't get the point, why would someone want to shut down bitcoin.org? 
@_date: 2019-07-07 19:03:03
What prevents, in your opinion, bitcoin from being spreadly adopted? Bitcoin cannot be artificially inflated so their value against Bolivares would raise quite quickly if Bs keep inflating the way they are doing.
Isn't it a very good reason for people starting a massive adoption?
What's the point? Lack of "culture" (speaking about the internet of money)? Lack of technological means?

Don't be an I-know-everything moron, there are issues on every exchange according to what people write here.
You are being of no help. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 08:41:59
Oh, ok! Then you need to know that bitcoin network has nothing to do with bitcoin.org ����
@_date: 2017-12-06 13:03:56
Gosh what's your fucking problem?! How could I imagine such a thing, I'm a coinbase user and I just felt singled out! You seem like a fucking fanatic sect! Calm the hell down, I'm a real user using coinbase and I still had no concerns with that, though everybody's talking bad about it.
I'm trying to figure out the point and find a better solution, if you have one.

I'm sorry, maybe I misunderstood the last graph at the bottom of [this link]( 
What does "Exchange Weighting" mean?

I'd rather say there is no way at all for whoever to link a public key on the blockchain to a specific person.
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:36:12
Excuse me guys, there's something I'm missing. How can such thing happen? If I purchase bitcoin via credit or debit card the transaction is instant, whereas if I perform a wire transfer then I will get fiat deposited in my account, and not bitcoin. How can a transaction be still pending and agreed at a certain price if we are talking about a wire transfer? If he's saying the transaction is still pending I can suppose we're talking about a wire transfer, can't I? 
@_date: 2017-12-02 09:47:51
If rightly got the point of your question here's my answer: don't be fooled, they are not *real* bitcoin transaction, otherwise they couldn't be instant.
Gdax (coinbase) makes it possible just because the management of your btc addresses is transparent to you, you don't know public and or private key where btc - let's say - are "stored", they are just assigned to your account and when you trade on gdax they just change the assignment.
This is also why - I'm not sure - I think I read somewhere that btc transactions between coinbase accounts are instant and free.
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:33:50


Why's that? 
@_date: 2017-12-06 12:37:07
That's what I'm trying to do, are you going to help or just shitting around about your supposed knowledge? If coinbase is not the proper exchange to manage your wallet, which one would you suggest? 
@_date: 2017-12-05 10:41:49
I think we misunderstood his question, I suppose he meant "if I sell bitcoin on the exchange and I have fiat in my wallet (let's say dollars) and then btc price falls down, do I lose something?".
Did I get the point?
If this is the case I don't see any reason why you should lose anything.
@_date: 2017-12-15 00:21:23
I've just read [this wonderful and very clear article]( that can explain the point.

Would you please link further information? You mean I don't have to pay any taxes if I earned by a short investment?

I'm still holding but this is a shitty piece of advice.

Ok, tell me if I got it right: that's the value I was thinking I was looking at but it's limited to euro market. Correct?

Ok, thank you very much! I'm correcting the post.
Thank you also for the link ����

Seeing this shit on r/bitcoin makes me think every "good" news (for bitcoin price) posted here is bullshit pumped up to an actual thing.

Seriously man, get all that fanatic shit out of your head.
You are a paranoid weirdo.

@_date: 2017-12-06 14:40:59
It's not your fault man, for what you knew you could have also lost everything as well, you have been prudent.
It was a reasonable choice ����
@_date: 2018-06-17 21:45:46
I think what he wanted to point out is that Bitcoin will keep existing, not as other cryptocurrency will probably do.

How much money would be helpful for a family / person to receive, let's say in a month?
@_date: 2019-06-18 01:47:36
You're right, I've just approximated badly, nevertheless precise math wasn't necessary for the whole point to persist, in this case, because it's slightly less than 80%.

So you mean BTC aren't actually used directly to buy things, don't you?

Energy consumption will rise more and more regardless of bitcoin, in my opinion the point is not *how to make bitcoin more eco friendly*, instead it's *how to make energy production in general more eco friendly*. 
@_date: 2019-06-23 15:36:21
The point is in fact that choosing when to buy bitcoin is not random.
@_date: 2017-11-16 01:09:51
Actually it is a power law: if you have a daily gain of 0.021% and X is your money, it means that after 1 day you'll have X+0.00021X, but the second day you'll have:
(X+0.00021X) + (X+0.00021X)0.00021 =
X + 2x0.00021X + X0.00021²
And so on...
Therefore there actually is a sort of *power law* - thus not clean.
I don't know whether the prediction might be correct or not, but it definitely can make sense.

In my opinion the saddest thing in life is being forced to waste our time - that is the most precious thing we have - doing something we don't like.
If you truly love her but you are - rightly - concerned about big changes in your life, find a little excuse - like an improvement in your salary - to justify the fact that she can quit the job - and maybe find something better.
Try to keep her out of the *boring bureaucracy* of financial things and manage the purchase of a house.
If she will find something out the old *"I wanted you to love me not for what I own but for what I am"* is always lifesaving ��

There is a strong correlation between the two of them in this moment, I suppose.

We don't need to find a "utility", they are money, they already have one.
We just need to spread the word and make people adopt them - the increment of value we have right now is just an incentive to be a precursor.

Could you be more explicit about the fees you would avoid? There are tons of fees on coinbase

The graph shows you the total amount of bitcoin you can buy (or sell) below (or above) a certain price considering the orders placed in the order book not filled yet. It is cumulative.

Bitcoin addresses aren't one time use "by construction", if it's forcedly so it's because of coinbase policy.
Does this mean I cannot see my address even if, for instance, I wanted to receive a second payment on the same address? (I know it's not recommending, it's just for example)

I don't want to create a whole different post, but what about the pop-up that has just shown up in the coinbase app saying that transactions are temporarily disabled due to facilitate segwit2x implementation? I'm confused o.O

Is it correct to say that these options are very valuable if you are a "holder"?
I mean, if I want to trade how can I exchange easily if I don't have an integrated service like, for instance, the one in blockchain.info or coinbase.com?

However it has to be said that nowadays most of ATMs actually do ask for (for instance) a face foto and / or fingerprints and / or sorts of documents.

We must say that if this manipulation is possible is also because adoption is not *that* spread all over the people.  
When bitcoin distribution will become larger it'll be more difficult for the whales to drive the price up and down.

If you set up a full node aren't you helping solving blocks to add to the blockchain? Even without doing your personal transactions 
@_date: 2018-11-26 17:52:56
That's the point. Maybe I haven't been clear but I was showing this not as a good sign. 
@_date: 2018-11-26 15:58:32
That would make the network stronger, for that I said "help".
What I'm interested in now is to understand if running a full node means (or doesn't) mine. I thought that that was the point, if I'm running a node means I'm contributing to the network. Am I wrong? 
@_date: 2019-01-22 23:52:41
... yet.
