*sigh* ok you are right.
What about the landing page? What is it that turn you off, too plain?Amateurish?

Https??? I mean the worst someone can do with their account is deposit money for them and request a withdrawal.Depositing money requires you to login to a paypal account. And requesting a withdrawal requires access to the users email. Very transparent stuff.
I think either you guys are misunderstanding the scale here or I am being very very naive.

Paypal. Plus the fact they can easily get my name address, everything. I'm not a criminal just a college student who likes bitcoin.
But even if i did run away, the minimum deposit is $25, people wouldn't be losing their life savings.

Why would I get in trouble? 
Maybe Mutual Fund is a bad word. I am collecting peoples money in a pool  and paying them back their profit minus a little percentage. Is this really Illegal? 
Also I like the idea of helping people set up their wallet, but a lot of people just don't have the patience and get really confused by cryptocurrencies, which is sad because we can all really benefit from it.

Based in Gainesville, Florida but this would be much more of a local venture than an actual mutual fund (which has over 150,000 in startup costs.). We do though model most of our cost of Transactions fees/cost after mutual funds and the SEC's regulations. Also we use paypal for transactions so the buyer is always on the safer side.
But again this really isn't targeted towards the world right now just a local thing.

I'm not asking you for money. I think maybe I shouldn't have called myself a mutual fund, I'm in a business suit on wall street yelling prices, I'm just trying to help some friends invest in bitcoin by pooling in their money. 
What do you think I should call it?

turned 20 like 2 months ago, trust me I'm not a criminal. Also again I'm not targeting you guys but people my own age that I see face to face.

Again local, I expect to see most of the people who use this site face to face, made a new account, and I wasn't asking you to join. Just asking what you think of the idea/website.
