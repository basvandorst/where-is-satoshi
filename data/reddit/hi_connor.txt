yea, it was sold by Newegg, and it was a limited offer. My guess is that it's out of stock while I'm paying with bitcoin, there is probably a time gap. Also they receive bitcoin via Bitpay, Bitpay wouldn't know the product is out of stock so the payment window will be still open at the time.

Then hold what you want to say to yourself. Yes, I fucked up and learned my lesson. I'm pretty sure a lot people would miss the term when they pay, so this is the warning for people who want to pay with bitcoin.

Luck you! Probably I shouldn't try to get the limited offer, as it's 2/3 of regular price.

Watch your language! I didn't say people shouldn't buy things with bitcoin online. I just hope people be warned. Also I believe btc is the future, but companies should do the right things to empower that.

Those btc I spent was from mining, I just considered that I probably need pay tax if I convert them.

I'd think the situation should depends, I agree with you in such case. But for my situation, they cancelled the order because it's out of stock, so I'd think it's right to refund with btc or USD.

yea, and it's very easy to be missed, so I hope people be warned when they want to buy things with bitcoin online. People surely will lose money in such situation.
