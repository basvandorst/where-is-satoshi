Bitcoins properties make it not useful as a currency, they actively discourage use as a currency.

"Respectable exchanges" lol, what, the biggest one wasn't respected at all prior to this?  No shit the price has rebounded, all you "to the moon!" morons have been jumping in on the "cheap coins".

Currencies aren't supposed to work like that though, think about how money has slowly decreased in value as total wealth increases. That's why the constant game of trying to convince people to use bitcoin as a currency while personally you are just holding it and relying on it to deflate is nothing but a ponzi scheme.

That's because the market is deluded and will ignore any problems with bitcoin because their money and ego is on the line.

Oh definitely, sorry, I'm not saying that's the only issue and they are definitely related. Say you have 1000 people with a bitcoin each and their perception of its value is steady. They all know each other and they've worked out that 1 bitcoin is enough to buy lunch. Now 100 people want to come along who want to use bitcoin but only 1 more bitcoin has come into existence (and eventually this will be even less, no inflation). Now 1001 bitcoins has to buy lunch for 1100 people, so the bitcoins are now worth 1.1 lunches each. So now the 1000 people say to themselves "hmm, if I skip lunch today, I'll be able to buy 1.1, maybe even 1.2 lunches tomorrow!" And so they are discouraged from spending. This is deflation at work and discourages people from using bitcoin as a currency. If it isn't useful as a currency (at least as useful as fiat which it currently definitely isn't because of volatility and difficulty in converting it) then its only good for speculating. 
Of course as you say, now the number of people holding it as an investment is greater than those using it as a currency which is pretty much the nail in the coffin, but it's deflationary nature makes this outcome inevitable even if people were only acting rationally (which they are absolutely not, judging by threads on here saying it's a win/win whether it gains or losses value).

Seriously, does Miami has more banks than any other country in the USA because Bankers like to work on their tan? I don't think so (though they may like that too...), it's because of drug money.

It's always going to "weather the storm" in the minds of hardcore supporters who use these fuck ups to buy cheap coins, keeping the "value" high, but the overall number of people holding coins decreases. More to the point bitcoin can never achieve large scale adoption because the supply will never meet an increase in demand enough to facilitate trading. Instead any increase in interested people raises the price so it's deflationary, better to hold than spend.
These fuckups pave the way for a better and more useful cryptocurrency.

How do you rationalise that with bitcoins deflationary nature which insures with increasing demand (more users) there is more incentive to use it as a currency. I.e. bitcoin actively discourages using it as a currency, it is only really useful for speculating.

It'd be an inflation of the supply, the value would drop significantly if they were suddenly sold.

Supply expanding to accommodate increased use...

That's not what I said, I'm saying that Bitcoins deflation is not condusive to it being used as a currency.

That’s impossibly cheap, you mean 25c/kWH right?
