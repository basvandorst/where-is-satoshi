2MB blocks is too much for decentralization. That's been BTC roadmap this whole time. Use BCH for bigger blocks because there is no fuss, just brilliance. :)
I just bought a new graphics card with BTC and the transaction was too **SLOW** and **EXPENSIVE** like a digital gold knockoff

Not interested in debating the (de)merits of big blocks vs SegWit, etc.
I'm simply correcting your incorrect point that big blockers say LN/L2 is impossible.
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:31:29
No they don't. They just say "unnecessary". Scale on-chain first, then add additional layers as needed, not as a replacement to on-chain scaling.

Not everyone immediately, but that's a great start, right? 32MB is a lot of daily transactions. On-boarding the world will take decades. We have time, but we need to start.
Linear scaling is part of it. There are other things devs can be working on to add. 2nd layers are great when they are stable and *optional*, not the primary means of transactions for a majority of users in the economy.
I'm not a dev on that level.. I'm a dev that can make webapps for end-users and help on-board them to the Bitcoin economy. But, there are many smart developers for Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, and in even in many altcoins. Every one of them should be focused on adding to linear block-size scaling

I look at utility first, as when the market does the same the price follows. BCH has provably more utility than BTC. I want a Bitcoin that works
@_date: 2018-08-25 02:55:36
Then why haven't they for years? Why don't they now? What's the delay?
Fine by me if they negate BCH as long as I have a Bitcoin that works as p2p cash
@_date: 2018-08-25 03:05:56
All I can say is that I see that BCH can work today and that BTC failed to work last year. I don't play into the drama or political shit

@_date: 2018-08-25 03:50:28
fair, but with the demonstrably inevitable bank failures as only the tipping point, it's fair to say that humanity will suffer immensely (perhaps not outright "fail") if they don't do something **FAST** to help cushion the fiat crush. Bitcoin is a solution, but BTC in Nov 2017 couldn't perform. BCH can **TODAY**. That's my only point; we need to start migrating the world to Bitcoin. :)
@_date: 2018-08-25 02:43:29
I'm not here to argue or debate. I'm here making a plea. The USD and worldwide fiats systems are FAILING. Let's get merchants and users off of these systems. I want to work towards that.
The last time people used BTC to its max was Nov 2017 and only the well-off could afford the fees. We need everyone to be able to use Bitcoin if we are to defeat the banksters
EDIT: Idc about dev drama. I care about RESULTS
@_date: 2018-08-25 02:36:05
What was the worst?
@_date: 2018-08-25 03:23:45
I am thinking long-term. Long-term is worldwide adoption, but problems are happening **TODAY**. We need action **TODAY**. We can't keep waiting for months on end for solutions when the block size increase is sufficient to accommodate the current demand *and then some*..
a block size increase might just be the accommodation BTC needs to allow development of LN to continue while also allowing cheap on-chain flow of money *for the people that demand it
But as of **TODAY**, BCH allows for cheap on-chain flow of money *for the people that demand it
@_date: 2018-08-25 20:25:12
BCH never claimed to be BTC. It has rightfully claimed that it is a ~~Bitcoin protocol implementation~~ version of the Bitcoin protocol.
Denying BCH is Bitcoin *at all* is a lie.
@_date: 2018-08-25 03:09:39
I'm not playing into politics. I'm talking about Bitcoin adoption. BCH is the Bitcoin chain that can currently help facilitate that. I want to get more users off of legacy fiat and onto Bitcoin. BTC can't handle the load though..
YOU are talking about Roger Ver, Jihan Wu, and whatever other scammers as if that is going to help further Bitcoin adoption.
EDIT: fixed some bad grammar and added more words to elaborate my point
@_date: 2018-08-25 02:37:30
No, I was looking not for a "badge of honor" like most others there. I want to BRIDGE the communities. I want BITCOIN. Both chains are Bitcoin. Which one can we use TODAY to defeat the banksters?
EDIT: BTC proved a failure as cash Nov 2017.

I'm not saying anything about the US dollar. I'm saying that I would like Bitcoin to be more widely accepted, whether in BCH or BTC. I'm **TIRED OF** the US dollar..
Bigger blocks aren't inadequate to handle the current demand for crypto. They aren't inadequate to handle Nov 2017's load either.
By the time the world is ready for onboarding, I'm sure we can find ways to offload some transactions. Either way tho, we will need BIGGER BLOCKS. 1MB is simply NOT ENOUGH

Your opinion that its a shitcoin doesn't explain how its dishonest.
@_date: 2018-08-25 02:52:25
I believe in round earth. Pretty sure that's off-topic though so I won't say anything more.
BCH has utility. Price follows utility when markets demand utility. I want a Bitcoin that works as cash and works for merchants and not only for trading altcoins on centralized exchanges that get hacked every other day.
That comment was sarcastic but also true.. you don't own your Bitcoin if you don't hold the privkeys.

No, I'm just stating that fact in response to you posting the BCH/BTC ratio
@_date: 2018-08-25 18:06:07


How? BCH is Bitcoin at a protocol level. If my post wasn't removed you'd see how I explained that. I've also explained it in comments on this removed post. BCH is *demonstrably* Bitcoin.
BCH is Bitcoin w/ on-chain scaling
BTC is Bitcoin w/ no on-chain scaling but primary focus on secondary layers
Let's be realistic if we are going to refute another coins value/stature/what have you

@_date: 2018-08-25 18:57:49
Its not a debate. I asked why you think BCH is dishonest. If you don't wish to relay your opinion then that's your prerogative.
@_date: 2017-08-26 01:48:37


I completely agree with you.
However, I feel I must say, that there are currently 2 Bitcoins that carry the "original chain". Just because there was a UAHF (and the world didn't end) doesn't mean that one side is "original" and the other is not.
The "original chain" died once the split occurred; now both Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin Cash are extending upon that point of the "original chain" in separate directions, thus they are no longer considered the "original chain".
It can be argued that "Bitcoin Core is still the original since it maintained the original protocol and consensus", but that argument holds 0% H2O since the current 1MB block size consensus under which Bitcoin Core software operates came into place AFTER a hard fork. The "original chain" had no block size limit.
Bitcoin hasn't been the "original chain" for a long time, and can no longer be.
Moving forward, though, the chain that possesses the claim to the name "Bitcoin" is the chain with the most accumulated Proof-of-Work.

Sorry but now you're contradicting yourself.
If they were not meant to have a say, then which powers are supposed to be separated?
@_date: 2017-01-26 19:11:40
My definition of "3rd-party" in the above was exactly that; reliance upon an external server for funds management/access.
If there are already services that provide this type of service without holding the Bitcoin, and allows the business to hold it immediately following the transaction, then that eliminates the POS aspect of my idea.
However, there's still the problem of management. My idea would implement a business-side management interface to pay employees, expenses, etc.
@_date: 2017-08-21 03:41:21


And the materials to print them are not in infinite supply, hence my point.


Umm, then how else would that work without malware?


When was last time?


Again, not without some sort of coordinated router manipulation and/or malware/botnet. But if you have other plausible methods, please share.


Turns out there's a new proposal called [Bedrock]( to address this, with minimal cryptographic overhead but addresses the issues outlined. From the proposal:


Implemented as a Stratum extension. Sounds like a worthy fix to me :thumbsup:
@_date: 2017-01-26 19:09:07
The idea was to replace the traditional "cash flow" you're referring to with a Bitcoin "cash flow".
Obviously not all expenses could be paid in Bitcoin, as Bitcoin isn't adopted widely enough for that.
This is more theorization as to the efficiency and feasibility of such a system in a Bitcoin-dominated "cash flow" market.
Your hints don't address my question. Yes, BitcoiN can be accepted by any business wanting to accept Bitcoin, simply by running Bitcoin on their phone or other device. Clearly, from a management standpoint, that isn't feasible. What IS feasible is central management of a node that contains all funds associated with payments made to the business. That's the idea: allowing businesses to manage their Bitcoin "cash flow".

They would still run into the same supply issues since they would then need the same top ASIC chips used by the miners. They can't just print those from a money press. China, however, could try to confiscate them, but if that were to happen, the network would be made aware immediately and then China would drop out of the pool of mining hashrate. Plus, that's not very likely anyway since [China is embracing Bitcoin]( (notably the *China bitcoin policy recommendations* section)


This requires coordination/control with/of the ISPs providing the pool's connection, or at least control of one of the hops on the route taken from miner's IP to the pool IP. Assuming they have this control, pools/miners would recognize nefarious activity practically immediately. And even if they didn't, this serves bad actors no benefit other than to slow down block times for that particular pool, and only marginally slows transaction confirmations times. Weak sauce.
Actually, a very simple fix for that MITM attack would be GPG signed messages. Pool provides public key, miner verifies pool signature upon negotiating connection (some sort of challenge mechanism) and throughout the lifetime of the connection, and MITM neutralized.

Incorrect. Package deal was agreement made in New York by miners.

@_date: 2017-08-20 22:07:49
Replay protection against what? What do you mean "original chain"? You need to provide more detail.


What are you talking about?


You mean, SegWit has their chain and 2X has theirs? So, you **want** another hard fork?
@_date: 2017-08-20 21:45:36


I don't disagree, however developers also bring the choices to miners because the miners have to use the same software as users; if they don't, there's no software consensus, which causes disagreement between the users and the miners.


[Not really]( The NYA was put in place because some users/miners wanted only SegWit and other users/miners wanted bigger blocks.
This was a compromise to prevent the split by Bitcoin Unlimited that had a significant portion of the network hashrate at the time; activate SegWit now and then hard fork to 2MB blocks within 6 months.
Seems now a lot of people, users and miners combined, want to renege on the 2MB portion of the agreement that 80% of the network is currently signaling for. That's causing contention whereas the NYA was removing contention.
@_date: 2017-08-21 02:27:10
What you're failing to take into account is that even with the government(s) and its/their unlimited budget thanks to central banking, there isn't enough supply of mining equipment to satisfy them being able to "shutdown Bitcoin".
The only options they have are:
* Worldwide EMP (no government(s) is/are coordinated enough for this)
* Shut off the Internet (again, not nearly coordinated, and too impractical for world commerce just to shutdown Bitcoin)
The only damage that can be done at this point to marginally affect Bitcoin would be to shut off DNS, but even that would have spotty results and with the P2P tech underlying Bitcoin, plus the ability to enable "connect" config directives for specific IPs, Bitcoin would practically remain unaffected.
EDIT: One thing they could also do is coordinate with a bunch of mining groups to try and 51% attack, but miners' incentives is dependent on Bitcoin retaining value and users using it, so that will fail as well.
@_date: 2017-08-20 21:55:59


Not really, because a lot of merchants agreed to the NYA as well because that was the consensus. That was users (i.e. merchants) and miners agreeing on a scaling option going forward. That's not force.


Please elaborate. What is this "hostile takeover" that sprung about all of a sudden?


If by "users" you mean "ordinary people transacting on the Bitcoin network", then how is implementing a 2MB hard fork "forcing" users to do anything they wouldn't already be doing? Am I missing something?
@_date: 2017-08-20 21:08:35


Incorrect, and here's why.
Let's say 1000 users decide to UASF to SegWit with no 2X. Who is going to confirm transacitons? New actors? Fair enough.
But suppose only 1PH/s is accumulated onto the non 2X chain. What's to stop a bad actor with 1.1 PH/s from beginning to mine on the non 2X chain and execute a 51% attack?
Also, how is that 1PH/s going to mine the next block with the current difficulty? Even with an emergency diff reduction that Bitcoin Cash has, the non 2X chain will effectively slow to a crawl until that diff reduction commences.
Also also, since we already have 2 Bitcoins, and possibly a third if 2X falls through, who in their right mind, sending a transaction **and expecting it to confirm with a reasonable fee**, is going to transact on a slow-to-confirm, high-fee fork of the Bitcoin blockchain?
@_date: 2017-01-26 22:18:50
I don't disagree with your premise. Part of what makes Bitcoin great is it's incredible ease of incorporation by a business as a payment option for customers. Install the wallet and go. Great!
But what is not being addressed is a business's management aspect.. how would they manage the bitcoin received by [EDIT] customers? My gut tells me: centrally-managed wallet/node. Great! now the business can accept payments all to the same wallet, using a different address each time, using a wallet that they control within their place of business.
This is to prevent the need for services such as bitpay and the others you outlined. It's giving the power of accepting and HOLDING the Bitcoin to the business instead of to a 3rd-party such as those you've outlined.
For instance, centrally-managed wallet generates address/QR code for customer to scan-and-pay. Funds then go straight to centrally-managed wallet. Management can then appropriate funds accordingly to employees, distributors for restocking supplies, etc.
It seems there's something in your point that I'm missing, or that you're missing in mine.
