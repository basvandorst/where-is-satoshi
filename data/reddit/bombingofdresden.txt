Some of the tech is reeeeally hard to understand with zero background. And if it is to become actual currency and not a commodity then you need the vast majority of laymen to adopt it.

Well this is awkward

Apple not supporting Bitcoin at this moment in time is not an example of what you're talking about.

I think you've forgotten everyone in is a tenured economics professor.

I've always been overwhelmed by that aspect of it. I'm mostly a lurker for that reason. 
There is a vocal minority that seem to be the equivalent of the "sovereign citizen" crowds. Just don't turn into please.

The founder of FedEx once saved his company by taking the literal last $5,000 the company had and playing blackjack with it. Wasn't enough money to keep the company going anyway so he figured why not.

Could you elaborate on their stance a little?

Ain't you never seen Apollo 13? We figured that shit out a long time ago.

Ahh, thank you kindly.

I completely understand your emotions right now. Essentially you were handed a windfall. It is not a black and white cut and dry emotional decision you just made. It was a difficult one and while it wasn't easy to do, you fucking did it. Everyone on here saying that they would have done the same thing? They would have hesitated. Don't let anyone convince you otherwise. The thing is, think about how you would have felt if you had lost 60,000 in cash in a bag with your name and address on it. It would be the easiest thing in the world to find the owner. And you would be hoping beyond all hope that they'd do the right thing. You did it, OP. I'm fucking impressed.

Roger that. I didn't want to keep large amounts on here so that's the next step I need to figure out. Offline storage. My wife has a laptop but my main device is my phone. Thanks for the advice.
