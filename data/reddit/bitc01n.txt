Ok, so the title is false then stating NO FEES. Exactly like I pointed out. Thanks for confirming :)
@_date: 2017-08-24 07:33:11
Free as in $8 for fees for the first Segwit transaction? Stop spreading lies Segwit will cause free transactions because they never will!
@_date: 2017-08-24 09:01:35
I get that from looking at the first transaction. Can you point me to a single free transaction??
@_date: 2017-08-19 09:43:12
Why not go 8mb instead?

What happened to this sub? The same as to bitcoin itself: The experiment failed miserably :(
@_date: 2017-09-13 11:41:02
Well seeing the value going down fast he does seem to have some power..

One more reply to address all the people suggesting to "polute" their database with either nonsense data or valid addresses/private key pairs which never will be used. This will not be a problem for the scammers at all.
First of all for those who don't have an idea what the relation between an address and a private key is. It's quite simple: Once you have a private key all other data can be substracted from there:
SHA-256(Random data) -&gt; Private key -&gt; ESCDA(Private key) -&gt; Public Key -&gt; Base58(Public key) = BTC Address
This means it's easy to check if a combination of provides addresses and keys are valid combinations or not. So combinations can be checked before inserting to the database resulting in storing of valid combinations only.
A second approach here suggested is by flooding the database using valid combinations of addresses/keys which will never be used.But the question remains what will this solve? Scammers will likely monitor the BTC-blockchain for addresses used which are in their database of harvested addresses/keys. It wouldn't matter if they have to check for a 1,000 or 100,000 addresses. Using a relational database this would take almost no time at all.

What's the use of a currency if all people hodl?
@_date: 2017-09-21 08:28:40
You're an optimist. BTC has already failed in my opinion :(
@_date: 2017-09-19 14:37:48
So is the average 10%?
@_date: 2017-09-27 06:44:26
All it takes is a scan of their local database, take the private key and use that to generate the address. Check generated address with the one stored in the database, if these are the same it means the database entry is a valid combination. A program to do this can be made in a couple of minutes and would make all the fake addresss combinations no problem at all.

This is an obvious lie since it's a parent/child transaction and  you conveniently only refer to the parent transaction..
@_date: 2017-09-20 11:29:15
Thanks for the link. I do agree with you that's the average is what counts.
@_date: 2017-09-19 14:32:56
The problem with throwing numbers like this around is you are just picking the numbers which match what you want people to believe.  
Based on the same picture you are using I could also say: OMG Segwit is failing!!1!! :( Just take a look at blocks 486008, 486002, 485986: A total of 4647 transaction, with 0 (0.00%) of Segwit transactions!

Can anyone explain to me in plain English why people still have so much confidince in this company?

Since Singles haven't even been produced there is no way 2 of them have shipped.
Believe me BFL would have let the whole world know if they did!
@_date: 2013-06-08 06:23:48
Everyone is entitled to his/her own opinion but this comment sums it up the best imho:
"BFL sells jals to slowly increase difficulty if they delivered the singles the jals won't sell. Its classic. The pre-orders that were priced too low was to garnish more pre-orders and kill competition 2 ways. 1 they would not even start a project as the funding would not be there. 2 as support in pre-orders b/c BFL has absorbed them all. 
Then they raise prices to stop people from asking refunds because they have ordered one of the earlier cheaper pre-orders then offer a upgrade in hashes along with updating the pre-order Que by confirming your order with updated shipping costs to make up for the low cost. classic
All the while keeping people from refunding along with getting more pre-orders in as they keep everyone strung along with false advertising and promises here.
As far as I see your all being played for fools. Being first adopters has a great cost to you all.
Don't be angry at me. I am your conscience."

Please add Butterflylabs - butterflylabs[.]com to the list. Even more put it at the  position in bold! 
They are running a very clever scamming operation getting lots and lots of money from "pre-orders" from people looking to get rich fast. Meanwhile these same people will do everything to defend the company just because  they can't face reality.
Taken oders since June 2012, products delivered to paid customers: 0 (zero, nada, nothing). But don't worry they will ship in 2 weeks, at least that's the official statement since September 2012.
One last thing: The owner of BFL has been convicted for multi-million fraud before and sentenced to 3 years in prison. But I guess everyone deserves a second chance...

Well this thread won't go anywhere if you defend the  scammers in the bitcoin community and defending their lies. Please all just downvote this thread and move on..
@_date: 2013-04-23 08:44:18
Wow 9 boxes!!!1!!! So I must have been wrong all along. Aaaarghhhhhh &lt;/sarcasm&gt;
So let me do the maths: Actual BFL ASIC-products delivered to customers = 0+0.
They are very clever scammers I have to give 'm that. But then again greedy people will believe everything because they want it to be true!
@_date: 2013-06-26 09:50:01
To be fair the standard response from BFL-fans has always been that you can always get a refund if you don't like the situation. Since this is no longer possible I think it is a BIG deal.
Furthermore difficulty is going up fast, so all 2013 orders from BFL probably will never see a 100% ROI. Add to the fact that the "shipping" from BFL has come to a full stop at the moment. Basically you're stuck as a customer, you paid in full upfront and BFL can wait forever to ship. So all in all declining refunds now is HUGE.
@_date: 2013-04-22 16:08:12
Congrats, not gonna waste any more time on this.
@_date: 2013-04-28 09:45:31
Yeah that's the sad thing about BFL, they are taking a lot of people down with them once they're out of business. Same thing goes for the numerous eBay sales for "a place in the queue".
Back on topic: OP, the idea seems OK, just don't base it on pre-orders. Get your stuff and then sell spots for a realistic price
@_date: 2013-04-22 11:16:11
Then just delete this thread since you won't include the most serious and biggest scam of 'm all!
@_date: 2013-05-02 12:19:51
Does that mean in your opinion BFL will have a problem once other ASCI companies start to deliver big time? Scarcity is out of the window by then...
@_date: 2013-04-28 09:52:54
I don't think you have any clue on what a DDOS is or does. You're proposed solution doesn't solve anything.
