To be precise, he called it speculative store of value. At the same time he did not reject the possibility of bitcoin becoming something more than that. Overall, it’s a positive shift from rat poison to neutral. Long way to go though

Yeah, you are absolutely right. Just an overall discourse of how bitcoin is being treated by finance people

My humble opinion is that investing in bitcoin is like playing Russian Roulette where you have 3 bullets loaded. There’s a huge chance that you will shoot yourself but the gains can be promising. When investing in btc I usually think of the following pros and cons: 
- the btc infrastructure is growing, big companies invest resources to attract stars to the industry. Why would they do it if btc is such a lame tech with no future?
- btc has a poor wealth distribution mechanism. You may consider today’s prices discounted, but the fact is that most btc are owned by a small minority whose motives are still not clear to me. God knows if they are here just for money and will cash out during the next bubble or they are really into the idea of changing the current financial system
As for the other news and shit, honestly I don’t care

I still have some hope in a very few other projects and decided to keep that share regardless of what happens next,  but for the past 4 months I’ve been buying btc only

The guy ended up badly. Not sure we can trust his advice

Well, I think you haven’t read Taleb. Even though black swans are unpredictable, he tells you not to do stupid things and explains how to manage risks, not predict them. What he says is fully in line with a current situation: the risks are detrimental, we just don’t know when the crash happens. It may take 1 year or 5 years, we don’t know, but the whole system is designed to be intrinsically flawed.

That’s fiat for buying dips
