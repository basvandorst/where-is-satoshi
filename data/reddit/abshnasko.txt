But that would conflict with what other nodes in the network would say. Just like I could broadcast that you paid me 100 BTC, but all nodes have to agree...
@_date: 2014-12-28 19:37:45
I think you can set it up to convert immediately. In this case, I'd like to just retain the BTC.
@_date: 2014-04-11 17:46:07
works for me
@_date: 2014-01-17 07:57:37
There is a sender and a recipient, just like Bitcoin. They both broadcast the transaction, and both of them have to agree. If they don't agree, the network has to figure it out. Bitcoin does this by knowing at all times the # of bitcoins in the economy. There needs to exist some similar analog to this concept in this bandwidth incarnation, and some way to verify transfers, similar to mining.
You're describing this:  It is known to be unsolvable, unless you are able to introduce the right constraints, as Bitcoin has.

what's the point of using my dollars to buy bitcoin if everyone just wants dollars to buy bitcoin? I'd like to accept them as a form of payment.
@_date: 2014-04-11 05:23:24
Yes, for the same reason they wait until December 28 to do tax-loss selling on securities. Why would I send my money to the US Treasury on January 1 when I could have it invested for another three and a half months? There's no reason I would want to loan money to the US government at 0% interest for any longer than you have to.

well, that's sort of the problem with freedom, right? people can do what they want. but this is a market, and they have a well-run, 0% fee pool, so that's where I mine.

I'm not optimistic that my real estate agent will know/care enough about bitcoin to help me. That's why I posted here

If PayPal accepts Bitcoin, then you can pay with BTC just about anywhere. Newegg accepts PayPal, for example. But it'll be interesting to see just "how" they support it... probably extra hoops to jump through etc.

This is getting a little too close to 50% for my comfort. And I appreciate the PSA. 2x Avalon 230GH/s moved to Eligius

The one that I'd like to start with is located in Virginia, USA.

Whoa, just watched it drop from 12.3k to 8.4k, now to 7.1k. Someone's eating it fast.
@_date: 2014-04-11 17:47:27
Maybe. Causality probably goes both ways. It looks like BTC continues to rebound after 8pm, April 11. interesting.
@_date: 2014-01-08 16:10:26
I'd be interested to see your plan on how you would ban Bitcoin without also banning the internet.
@_date: 2014-10-06 07:09:01
Down to 2400. It's about to get taken out.
@_date: 2014-01-24 08:49:29
I am considering a similar move. Do you have a mortgage on the property? Did you consult a lawyer?
@_date: 2014-12-28 19:24:20
Yes, I think I will immediately convert the deposit to USD to avoid potential issues there. I'll keep the rent payments in BTC
@_date: 2014-01-09 07:20:04
@_date: 2014-01-25 05:49:10
That's very... inspiring. But as a pragmatic human, I will probably do the opposite of what you did.
@_date: 2014-01-24 06:01:06
This is fantastic. This also means that Newegg will have no choice but to follow
@_date: 2014-04-11 03:59:50

60% of the coins is not 60% of the work, since it gets harder to mine them over time. Additionally, even after all coins are created, you still need to continue mining in order to verify transactions. This will encourage the creation of for-profit clearinghouses, banks, etc., very few of which currently exist.
@_date: 2014-10-06 07:05:29
I only bought 6 BTC. So it wasn't me.

"These laws are tantamount to the rape of all Americans..."
Let's calm down so we can engage in sober discourse. This is the type of exaggerated and paranoid FUD that Bitcoin skeptics use to generalize all of us. Language like this is harmful to the cause you intend to promulgate. Please stop.
@_date: 2014-01-09 19:28:22
but where's the "religious" part?
@_date: 2014-01-17 03:45:24
Well sure, you can't prove a *rate* because it is a derivative value. Both server and client publish the number of bytes they have sent and received, respectively. Just as if bytes were bitcoins... is there something wrong with this? I even have a genius name for it: BitByte ;)
@_date: 2015-01-03 02:05:25
What do you mean "real money"? In financial terms, if I set my price in Bitcoin, that just means I'm bearing the exchange rate risk inherent in any multi-currency transaction. This happens all the time with what you'd call "real money".
I have background in finance and I understand the risks. Thanks for commenting, but ultimately you're just trolling my thread with unrelated nonsense.

+1. The Neptune, at $3.32/GHs is one of the best values you'll find. They deliver above-spec and on time. The KnC Jupiter is legendary; originally spec'd at 400GHs, KNC delivered a 670GHs incarnation in November.
There are some good miners, but you might want to challenge your assumption that you could ROI in anywhere near "half a year". Most hardware will never pay for itself unless difficulty drops. Even the Neptune would merely break even (+/- 10%) at current difficulty rate of increase.
@_date: 2013-12-30 01:45:32
Market price of mining hardware implies anything less than about $4/GHs is impossible. This is 5 cents per GHs. This is like selling $1.00 for $0.20. It doesn't make any sense, which is suggestive of a scam.

GPU mining bitcoin hasn't been profitable for 6+ months. There are lots of reasons GPU prices could be high, in your opinion, but I'd be surprised it bitcoin is one of those reasons.
@_date: 2013-12-30 02:18:44
They periodically sell out and open up more orders.
@_date: 2013-12-30 02:19:59
True, but in general, the cheaper you go the less $/GH you'll be able to get. If you don't have at least $5-6k to spend, you're likely going to get boned on the $/GHs ratio, which is your core metric of profitability when comparing to the difficulty rate of increase and other risks.
@_date: 2013-12-29 00:07:44
unless it's leveraged 50x
@_date: 2013-12-30 02:25:02
Black Arrow's X-3 does have comparable $/GHs to the Neptune

Is it just me, or do bitcoin-related self-pity posts might as well include a photo of their hand, beggarly outstretched, expectant of donation?
@_date: 2013-12-30 02:42:55
Yea, I don't know what to tell you. It's the reality of the market.
@_date: 2013-12-30 01:59:32
I think you should tip me for pointing it out, then ;)
Trolling aside, I also don't feel good about downvoting them. Ideas? I'm glad VineCompilations gave him a $0.40 tip as a joke, but what's the point of polluting the blockchain with noise?
@_date: 2013-12-30 02:46:38
Maybe, but a lot of people are also selling their GPU setups for this reason. If there exists upward pressure on GPU prices, it's probably not bitcoin. Maybe silicon prices went up because Apple is building 10 million extra iPhones this quarter because of their China Mobile deal. Who knows.
@_date: 2013-12-30 02:23:02
Places like cex.io/ghash.io who have commoditized the "GHs" itself, and make their money on fees from derivatives trading and reselling these "GHs" units. They are perfectly happy to break even or even slightly lose on the mining itself since they resell their mining capacity for profit.

Most lending is currently done P2P, in forums like this, by and for people who are known and trusted.
