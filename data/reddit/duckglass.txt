I get that, im totally a newb, no questions asked. im just surprised that this stuff exists and that i downloaded it all off the main bitcoin.org website.

So if anyone wants the rest of my bitcoin after im done buying what i wanted to just reply to this comment. This whole bitcoin thing is fucked and im getting out of here asap, someone can have the remaining 30$ or whatever, i just want to be done with this.

I meant btc.com wallet that i downloaded off the bitcoin website, and simplex was the only option to buy bitcoin off the btc.com wallet. They also charge a 10$ fee plus 3.5% of the transaction to do so which i found out about 1 minute ago as you can see here  
Im extremely new to this

Im not scamming anyone? I actually gave away 30$ worth of bitcoin to someone... And im completely new to bitcoin yes, its why i clicked buy without doing any research, and got screwed over. Thanks for calling me an asshole for absolutely no reason though

No i figured it out, simplex charges 10$ plus 3.5% for whatever reason no matter how small the transaction
@_date: 2019-02-10 13:54:46
Im looking at the transaction and at the time of purchase until now, the price has only fluctuated 0.16$ (16 cents) did simplex really charge me 13.50$ in fees?

You are actually insane. Yes i had a gut wrenching feeling that made me want to off myself when i got screwed over.

Jesus christ some people are hostile on here, i just wanted to know if i got screwed over by a bad company, or if this was standard practice for buying bitcoin... thank you to everyone who helped and recommended places where i could spend the extra bitcoin i had to buy. Cheers.

Did you not read my first comment? Im not. Im done with it, I’m literally giving away all my bitcoin when I’m done with this one transaction. I just wanted an xbox gamertag for my nephew for a present, and they only accept bitcoin. I would pay with paypal or cash if i could, trust me. My only assumption was thinking that some sort of currency on this scale would be a little more regulated or less sheisty, but i was mistaken.

Heres where i found it
@_date: 2019-02-10 14:47:44
No cashapp in canada
@_date: 2019-02-10 14:56:33
I did. But I’m from canada, and nothing reasonable is available here. Ill throw 1000$ into the account, i don’t care, money isn’t the issue. I’m just more frustrated at how time consuming and confusing the whole process is because i have had to do 3 transactions now to get the original 100$ i wanted  to send. I work all day and am on call 24/7 for emergency surgery, i don’t have the time or the extra brainpower to be dealing with all this, i need that brain power to focus on saving peoples lives.

I typed into reddit “bitcoin” and found no shady stuff required lol... then i made a post asking if i got screwed over or if this is a normal occurance, since im new to bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-02-10 13:51:55
Sorry i have the btc.com wallet i guess, i downloaded it off the bitcoin website. I just wanted to buy something online for 100$ and now im like 3 hours deep trying to figure this all out. I guess i will buy another 20$ worth of btc?
@_date: 2019-02-11 01:11:21
No i downloaded the btc.com wallet off of bitcoin.org
@_date: 2019-02-11 00:29:58
Thanks for the idea, i already donate about 30k to charities every year, for fundraising party purposes. and i would donate the rest of the btc, but i already gave it away to someone before you commented. 
@_date: 2019-02-10 14:17:38
Yeah i ordered an extra 50$ worth, they charge 10$ and 3.5% which is absolutely fucked and makes me want to off myself
