This. These retarded campus communists make me sick. They are all delusional children. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 17:59:59
Great job. You already lost money. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 14:51:55
Awesome strategy General Retard. Why is a genius like you not in charge??
@_date: 2018-01-17 18:30:11
LN isn’t “weeks away”. Where are you getting this?
@_date: 2018-01-12 22:43:34
Better than the pattern of stupid in yours
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:46:26
The author as well as everyone quoted in that article have no understanding of the fundamental problems in the technology that are causing the current drop. I hope you all didn't invest more than you can afford.
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:36:41
Protip: If you get into cryptocoins, please make sure you understand the technology top-to-bottom first. Coinbase and bcash didn't cause this. Fundamental problems with the bitcoin protocol are the real cause i.e. 1mb fixed blocksize and no lightning network or segwit adoption.
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:12:38
Amazing story! We need to hear more.
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:03:36
Why do you think it will go to 20k given the astronomical tx fees? The LN fix is months or even years away.
@_date: 2017-12-26 00:49:53
The LN code is open source, is on github and anyone can contribute. Stark can’t control it even if she wanted to. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:35:25
There is only 1 exchange where that's happening. The majority seem to be trending towards &lt; 10k.
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:13:47
You are not wrong but the network desperately needs a stopgap until LN is here. The skyrocketing fees will kill this coin. A block size increase is the only way. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:08:23
Wow! I’m truly shocked. They have no timetable at all. This is a disaster. Their hubris will kill btc. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:54:53
Or you make a serious effort to understand bitcoin and put X dollars into bitcoin which is a function of reward/risk and you don't take out a personal loan with a high interest rate because your are not a fucking retard?
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:19:07
I think Coinbase is in the bag for BCH. I could see them renaming bitcoin to “bitcoin legacy” and bch to “bitcoin” and then things would flip overnight. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:38:35
Tried one today? Lol
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:43:09
Stark said there is a total of 4 developers working on the Lightning Network and there is no timetable for a release whatsoever.  That’s really bad news. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:01:11
I don’t know but I hope it’s real fucking soon. Bitcoin will be relegated to shitcoin status if the LN devs drag their feet on this another 6 months. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:37:02
Yup and soon they can hodl their zero worth shit coin
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:26:58
If your IQ is &lt; 90 it's a great idea.
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:23:29
Yup. He STILL doesn't get it.
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:19:54
Based on these astronomical tx fees that render the coin useless? Based on the fact that the LN fix is months or even years away? Based on the fact that the LN devs have absolutely no timetable for release?
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:24:16
You are arguing with morons.
It _might_ recover if the lightning network meets expectations and is mass adopted along with segwit.
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:31:28
Pretty accurate
Imagine being retarded enough to mortgage your house for btc
Solid advice according to r/bitcoin

A fool and his money are soon parted.
@_date: 2014-02-25 14:46:47
Looks like all weaknesses. You are not smart people. ;)
@_date: 2014-02-25 16:14:22
That's right imbeciles. Eagerly line up to get fleeced yet again.
@_date: 2014-02-25 16:35:12
Yes, it could be over folks. *Transaction malleability* is a big problem with the protocol. The largest exchange in the world just went down in a spectacular flaming fireball because of it.
@_date: 2014-02-25 16:06:18
You really are a complete moron. I hope your boss finds out and he sacks your stupid ass.
@_date: 2014-02-25 14:49:32
There's fucking morons, then there's *fucking morons*.
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:45:41
Sounds like you don't understand blockchain tech either if you can't admit that the huge mempool and skyrocketing tx fees have something to do with this plummet.
Every financial system is driven by greed.

This isn’t analysis. This is numerology. No more accurate than a cat-lady babbling over tarot cards. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 04:24:03
Tell that to cloud imperium games for writing star citizen. The most funded video game in history. $176 million dollars and counting. "accredited investors" is elite speak for "poor people not allowed to profit only chosen ones". 
Wake up!
@_date: 2018-02-02 15:38:23
Hope the 4 devs working on the LN get it working soon. If they don’t, Bitcoin gets totally eclipsed by another coin before 2020. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 16:16:49


Looks like you and 28 other morons don't know what that word means.
@_date: 2013-12-18 16:11:54
Haha! You're an idiot!
