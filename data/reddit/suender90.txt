I think it depends mainly on your age. If you are like 20 and your human capital is like 2Mio. $ then it could be a good idea to go all in into Bitcoin.
If you are over 60, then I would recommend a different approach, let‘s say an even more diversified portfolio ;-)

I think bitcoin promotes a different way of economy where everybody only buys what he/she really needs.
In the example of the article that means: If I really really need a jacket, then I buy a jacket. Otherwise I rather keep my bitcoin. 
What’s the problem with that?

That‘s true, you have to be careful with the information you find and I don‘t say that google is always right. However, in my eyes it’s better to google some information first and then ask precise questions about it.

Dear redditor for a day, to the best of my knowledge price could go up or down or sideways.

If you just want to just hold them, then a paperwallet is cheap and safe. Arguably more comfortable is a Ledger Nano S (costs around 100$ in Germany).

If you are under 30, then you probably have a high human capital. And if you have no debts, then I see no problem with having 20% of your holdings in crypto. I think for me it's also like 20% and I feel quite comfortable with that ;-)

Why do you think that stablecoins will be a catalyst for bitcoin‘s price? I mean, I don‘t know what‘s going to happen, but with their JPM Coins you probably can buy altcoins directly without buying bitcoin. And with stablecoins it seems to be easier to take out some money. On the other hand, regulated stablecoins can bring a lot of fresh money into the market.
tl;dr: The price can go up or down or stay the same
@_date: 2019-02-20 08:13:51
tl;dr: No, unless you have access to very cheap electricity and mining hardware

You are welcome! However, I only recommend Lightning for small amounts of money, because the technology is quite new and there are still some (unsolved) problems.

Since the transaction is broadcasted to the network you don’t have to keep your PC running. And I‘m really pretty sure that the transaction is confirmed until tomorrow...

I like BlueWallet. In this app, you have to create a segwit wallet and a Lightning wallet. Then you have to send some coins to the segwit wallet, from which you then can send the coins to the Lightning wallet (2 onchain transactions for which you have to pay fees). After that, you can use your coins in the Lightning network.
@_date: 2019-05-28 13:10:02
I‘m also ready for that, who is not?
@_date: 2019-05-01 20:38:34
So you say you will never use BTC (with lightning) to pay for coffee or something else?

I can say the same about ledger nano s.  And I really like their desktop application to manage the apps on the device and to have an overview over my portfolio.
