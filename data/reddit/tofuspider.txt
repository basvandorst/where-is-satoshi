They will probably attempt to convince Core to be onboard the 2x ship before deciding to drop from the agreement if they fail to convince Core. I expect the miners that are supporting Segwit-only originally to get out of the agreement if they still can't get Core onboard the 2x ship. Rational miners still trust the techinical expertise from Core not from a bunch of clowns as they are heavily invested in the network.

NYA isn't a suicidal pact but also it is because Core devs isn't onboard with it. Miners that are pro-segwit only originally will be onboard with the NYA provided that there is enough technical expertise to support it w/o the Core group. I personally haven't seen any pro-segwit only miners shouting explicitly that they will do a HF in november without the Core group.
Miners has huge risk since they are invested heavily into the Bitcoin network and they won't move unless there is a better dev group that has proven themselves to be better than Core. 
I'm sure you know all of these already. Right now the hostility from both sides isn't good and best is to delay the HF in order for everyone to have their face-saving moment.

We would get cheap coins when the FUD appears for S2X. Who knows what the price is or when that might happen, but MSM will surely promote the FUD around it to shake off the weak hands buying bitcoins right now. 
@_date: 2017-08-17 02:00:13
Coinbase is not stupid enough to risk getting a lawsuit when 2x doesn't have replay protection. Look how fast they turn around in their stance when they were threaten with lawsuits on not giving BCH out to their customers.

The altcoiners and hodlers that buy up BTC for the free 2x coins would cancel out the weak hands that are spooked from the FUD caused by 2x supporters and BCH supporters/MSM reporting wrong facts on this HF.  I think price would remain flat before the fork happens.
@_date: 2017-08-19 21:23:25
Go ahead and get some BCC. I'm sure there are quite a number of us hodlers with BCH eagerly to dump it at a higher price. :)

If NYA is so broadly supported, why must they do it through dishonesty and deceit? 
They could just explain that they might be a contentious fork from the core devs and if you support the NYA, just upgrade to btc1. At the same time, Barry can just ask the signatories to recommit their stance towards the NYA agreement once more to show their confidence in it.
@_date: 2017-08-19 21:55:56
Erik, please ask the signatories to reaffirm their commitment to the NYA by making a public statement that they fully intend to proceed with the rest of 2x. Is there a reason why this shouldn't be done?
@_date: 2017-08-22 03:43:10
Traders would always buy the hype and sell the news. This expected price correction is also good to shake off the weak hands and test the various support levels.
@_date: 2017-08-22 22:43:23
Segwit2x isn't going to happen in November. Most miners/exchanges still trust the technical expertise from the Core team. They won't outright withdraw from the agreement but will most likely collectively postpone the agreement till we have consensus from "all parties in the ecosystem" aka delay indefinitely. 
None of the exchanges and mining pool (the ones with good intentions) are saying explicitly that they will go to 2x chain without Core team included so far.

Please read Metcalfe's Law before you embarrass yourself further. The value of a network is based on the number of users using the network. A decrease in cost to access will only accelerate users into using the network ,thus making the network more valuable. How much is the network value of the Internet? Who knows with so many devices connected to each other everyday. However, Bitcoin is the only network that explicitly displays the network value through the price of its native token.

You can't store images since the space for it is too small. Storing hyperlinks/reference is no different then the internet indexing/storing hyperlinks/reference to an illegal image/resource, so if you want to kill blockchain, might as well kill the internet too for referencing.
Small blocks also leads to higher bidding for the scarce block space. So the higher the demand for Bitcoin, the more expensive to store any illegal or useless data on the Bitcoin blockchain. So not worth for someone do to it anyway.

It's time preference and if you don't overinvest, it doesn't matter in the short term. If you still value your gains in USD and be happy about profits in USD instead of BTC as unit of account, you haven't understand Bitcoin enough. Go educate yourself and maybe in time you would see why we say its the USD that is volatile against BTC and not the other way around.

Without replay protection on both chain, transactions done on the original chain is also valid on the 2x chain and vice versa. 
You can however mix your coins with the miners new coins post-fork. Once your txs are tainted with new coins that are invalid on the other chain, you are free to sell the coins on either chain without trouble.

Both. That's a friendly Hardfork on Oct 25 (Bitcoin gold) which isn't gaining traction, so no one really cares/support about it now. The mid-Nov hardfork is the real hostile attack on Bitcoin called B2X.

not if everyone is getting BTC just to dump B2X.
@_date: 2017-10-28 06:24:45
How can BTC price drop a lot if users can't get their BTC to exchanges to sell as txs are slow to confirm from no/slow new blocks mined on the BTC chain. 
Meanwhile, hodlers are happily selling their B2X on exchanges since there is quicker confirmation blocks for txs on 2x chain driving the price of B2X down even faster than normal.

Let them do what they want and be fools. It just means cheaper btc for us to accumulate while they waste their money away. They can buy btc from us later at a much higher price.

Slow blocks leads to lower inflation rate of bitcoin -&gt; fiat price rising thanks to hodlers of last resort buying in -&gt; marginally profitable miners coming in again. Slow block time only affect consumers not hodlers and that's assuming every consumer refuse to pay a higher tx fees for next block to tempt the marginally profitable miners.

I found the part where Anne's character ask Rebel's character if she put her 500k savings in cash and Rebel just replied "No, it's in Bitcoin." pretty cool earlier on. The store of value narrative is slowly growing.

I would find one there is more Bitcoin-focused though. Almost 5 years of blockchain hype that i know of and still no one yet find a problem that blockchain solves efficiently other than Bitcoin.

Not saying BFX/Tether is a good actor but where is the proof any of the other major exchanges are solvent? None of the other major exchanges provided any proof of reserves since 2015. At least be consistent and ask every major exchange to provide it instead of having BFX singled out.

Bitcoin will still produce a block every 10 minutes on average. Blockchain hopium to run out of supply and we will see more bitcoin not blockchain narrative. Tether will be  on CMC. ETH is still centralised and can't scale.
