If you are in a hurry, bump the fee (if your wallet supports it), otherwise just wait it will be fine.
Have a look at the priority.

With the same logic every single road should just have one lane because it's not scalable. Some temporary solutions such as adding new lanes are sometimes necessary because no other viable alternatives are available (public transportation, etc.) to respond to the demand. Other solution is just to diminish the traffic growth, which will eventually happen with the explosion of fees.

Typical comments:
"Don't buy games with bitcoin!"
"I am sending low fee transactions everyday, I don't understand..."
"But wait for LN"
So basically many users prefers to ignore the issue or convince themselves that bitcoin should not be spent to buy things??
It seems like the only practical way to actually spend your bitcoins now is to go through an exchange for another coin or fiat. What happens when regulations/laws try to limit or block these exchanges? Aren't you worried about this?

Sounds like you are just mad to have miss an opportunity to ride the BCH pump.

It's not really weird but who cares if core is against increasing the block size, they don't call the shots.

Bread supported this months ago already...

Thanks, sadly I don't have an android device.
@_date: 2017-12-26 04:36:06
Or how to get easy info to track users...

To be fair, without its name bitcoin will also lose a lot of its recognition. I understand that newbies can be confused with such similar names, but its a risk in the open source software world where anyone can decide to fork the original version.

For anyone having troubling getting verified on GDAX, first use this link on Coinbase to add a new document: 
Then use the mobile camera verification method.

Had to wait 4 days for a 80+sat/b tx to confirm. I am transferring my funds to a segwit address....

You mean what Bitcoin has become.

If you really believe in the bitcoin project, the price does not really matter now. All the drama around those centralized “alternatives” just show how lot of people came recently for speculation. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 23:45:19
OP is just frustrated because of the BTC current congestion.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:51:19
It's fast and easy but how are you supposed to charge your lightning wallet? I have some tBTC on a bitcoin tesnet wallet, do I have to setup myself a lightning node to use it?
@_date: 2017-12-14 14:15:01
Short term solution is still a solution... While waiting for LN to be ready, deployed and used by companies, other popular coins are not waiting and they happily use the current situation high fees situation of bitcoin to convince more and more users.
@_date: 2017-12-06 16:56:13
Can’t believe this story. Sounds completely fake.
@_date: 2017-12-14 14:25:28
Nothing about LN makes it mandatory to use it with bitcoin. How wonderful to be so confident that no other coin (litecoin for example), can use the current situation to overtake bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-14 15:35:03
I agree, other coins will also eventually face the exact same issues. However when they do, no guarantee that bitcoin keeps the lead.
@_date: 2017-12-14 15:56:34
You are talking of other communities as if it was an entirely different group of people, which I highly doubt for the other major coins.
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:11:47
Of course alts pretend to do so, it's marketing.
Many other big projects/companies also thought they could resist anything because they were here first and had more experience.
@_date: 2017-12-14 15:42:57
Exchanges are already off-chain scaling solutions, they just aren't decentralized and trustless. It is very likely they will continue to act as hub between the crypto and fiat world, as LN nodes or using their own solution.
@_date: 2018-02-01 14:58:18
I’m more focused on the adoption. So far I feel lightning is getting some momentum but it is still early stage.

Getting mine to sync with the bitcoin network first.
