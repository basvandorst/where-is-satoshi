I have nothing left to spend for several months, but I'm fucking thrilled with $14,356.42 even though It was a super small buy.

I've been involved in bitcoin for a while, but it wasnt until recently that I've come to fucking hate the banks, or atleast my bank. 
My primary bank is an online bank without physical branches, and I use a local credit union to pay my bills.  The amount of money in my credit union account fluctuates between $10 and $1000. I'm not sure if this matters, but I have zero debt, and don't have a credit card. I went in one day to withdraw $800 at a time when my account had ~$1000 to avoid making two trips to the ATM since maximum withdrawal is $500.
Anyway, they asked me to fill out a form that was basic information, and had "Reason for withdrawal:" listed on it.  I filled out the form, and wrote "N/A" for the reason. The teller told me this wasnt a valid reason. I wrote, "Personal", which also wasnt a valid reason.
The real reason was that I was going on vacation abroad and wanted to have some cash on hand, but I felt this was totally unnecessary to disclose. Next, for the reason i wrote, "Food, Beer, Snacks, Water, Cigarettes, etc.", which still wasn't a fucking valid reason. I told them I did not want to fill out the form, and that the reason was totally unnecessary.
The teller said, he was unable to process my withdrawal without a valid reason in that box. I ended up finally writing, "Vacation", which was a valid reason, and they gave me my withdrawal.  On vacation, the things I spent some of that money on included Food, Beer, Snacks, and Cigarettes.
I don't understand, but closing my account is on my to do list. What the fuck though? I thought credit unions were supposed to be better than banks, but I should have just went to the ATM two days in a row.  It isnt like were talking about very large sums of money, Im sure as hell not wealthy.

I will intentionally make a large withdrawal in the near future and take a photo of this form. I mean large as in relative to the total amount in the account. It was the same form I filled out years ago at Wells Fargo when I withdrew ~$4000 to buy a motorcycle when I had about ~$5000 in the account.
