The fact that there is already an address in the blockchain (holding 40k BTC) isn't enough to claim that the public key was, well, revealed (public in a broad sense)?

In this case, it was just some jobs done at a fixed-rate price. I'm trying to figure out what would be a fair way to calculate its value in Bitcoins, without ripping him off, but also, without me being in disadvantage. 
If I tell him that, at today's exchange rate he owes me 1 BTC, and then he waits a few days (even just 1 or 2) to pay me (and Bitcoin price goes up), then he might end up paying me 0.9 BTC (at a 2-days-in-the-future exchange rate). Clearly, I'd have lost because of him not paying me promptly.  
Sorry if this is too obvious for all of you, I'm just thinking aloud :)

Nice try, California.

How will you know the "change" address (both public and private keys) for the transaction you started on step 8? 
Will you be notified of it on step 10, after submitting the transaction?
I ask because it would be nice to inform people how to avoid [losing their bitcoins](

Does [this girl]( work at Mt. Gox?  
Stock photography may hurt your credibility. What about seeing some real faces behind the hard work &amp; magic of Mt. Gox?

Thanks. I think I understand what you mean. Let's see if I can figure it out...
Supposing that a week ago, 1 BTC = $100, and today, 1 BTC = $200, then the average is 1 BTC = $150.
If he owes me $300, then at today's price (1 BTC = $200), he owes me 1.5 BTC. But if I take the average price (1 BTC = $150), he owes me 2 BTC, while if we took the price of one week ago (1 BTC = $100), he owes me 3 BTC.
Yeah, definitely, I'd be ripping him off.
One interesting thing of agreeing a job contract only in Bitcoins (and not doing a conversion from one currency to another) is that it's up to the client to get the bitcoins at a good price. He could wait to last minute to buy the agreed amount of bitcoins (in current trend, he would be paying more) or he could buy them as early as possible (saving some bucks compared to waiting to buying them on last minute).
