A lot were deleted, and users were banned from the sub. You can't say anything negative about bitcoin or Andreas which is bitcoin's god and people praise him here even when he scams them over and over and over and over again. It is really funny to actually see people here defending the most obvious scammer in bitcoin atm.

But Andreas Topulopulus , our God And Bitcoin Leader said we can trust him?

hahaha just like when he washed his hands after vouching for MTgox and Karpeles , and the other guy who is now in jail for doing business with silkroad and now new&amp;bee. Populopulos the biggest scammer of all knows how to do it, scam people, then say he didnt know and his army of dumb ass lickers and followers will ride his dick no matter what he does. Keep going idiot, next thing you work for is in my black list, whatever this scammer says is in my black list.
