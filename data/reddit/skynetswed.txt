@_date: 2017-08-01 13:50:04

@_date: 2017-08-31 07:57:31

@_date: 2017-08-26 21:15:34
You supporting Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-08-27 13:16:25
Wonder if this could help getting away from paying taxes. Since with PayPal, you can spend dollars. Would ira pick that up? :)
@_date: 2017-08-26 21:07:14
Don't think you can transfer from coinbase to paypal
@_date: 2017-08-01 08:10:14
please elaborate.
@_date: 2017-08-26 19:07:07
Going to set up one next week :)
@_date: 2017-08-31 07:48:06

@_date: 2017-08-30 06:37:39
hardware wallet or Exodus.io
@_date: 2017-08-01 13:48:01
OMG, can you not read? They are providing a error message, please read that before posting here!!
@_date: 2017-08-28 19:52:57
if you have a trezor, thats your "keys"
When you setup you trezor, you wrote down a couple of words, thats your recoery seed. as long as you have those words, you will be able to access your coins.
@_date: 2017-08-26 21:08:16
Did some research, apparently you can
@_date: 2017-11-03 09:59:51
i think so to, i think we could go down to as low as 4000, but after that it will go up again
@_date: 2017-11-05 12:15:38
Your opinion is to not store at counbase?
@_date: 2017-11-16 11:51:16
and why is it a perfect time now?
@_date: 2017-11-05 11:15:35
What do you mean?
@_date: 2017-11-05 12:10:29
Yeah, am also not like to not have full control. The only reason a like the idea is that I might be able to do quicker decisions!
@_date: 2017-11-14 13:56:16
yeah maybe, but its better then some day ago
@_date: 2017-11-12 16:43:10
@_date: 2017-11-01 19:11:28
I think it will drop at the fork, but after that it will go high!
@_date: 2017-11-23 09:52:41
Okey, I see, 
@_date: 2017-11-02 10:18:00
I think we will se a drop after the fork, about down to 4500, sen it will just continue to go back up!
@_date: 2017-09-09 10:40:18
Nice !!
@_date: 2017-10-26 12:37:47
This is really simple!
@_date: 2017-10-31 14:31:08
put down your phone
@_date: 2017-10-26 14:49:09
Amazone is suppose to maybe announce something about bitcoin today, at least there is rumours....
@_date: 2017-10-26 07:19:55
You can recover your old Hive Wallet
@_date: 2017-07-25 19:57:54

@_date: 2017-07-28 11:41:29

@_date: 2017-07-23 11:46:47
You should try look at it long term :)
@_date: 2017-07-31 17:14:27

i thinking of this for example, 
that a regular "line" chart. anyone know what value is used for the specific pricepoints
@_date: 2017-07-23 11:39:53
Yes, I see it as a good thing, we get to buy cheap
@_date: 2017-07-23 11:36:55
Probably a lot of people who bout last week's dip, cashing out
@_date: 2017-07-23 12:41:22
Let's see if it's done dipping yet
@_date: 2017-07-23 12:56:57
The price will rise
@_date: 2017-07-23 13:15:43
It's just a guess. And no, I have not downvited anyone
@_date: 2017-06-26 11:34:33
I think we will see slot of alt coins for quite a while, some of them will rise and become "big" (recognized as a real crypto currency, just like bitcoins) , while others will disappear!
I see a future with multiple accepted crypto currency, bitcoins are just the beginning!
