Because, theoretically, it isn't your own property. On a very basic level, if you want to own land you need to be able to force other people off of it. This usually boils down to a question of might makes right. The difference is, we've outsourced the protection of land to a legal system enforced by a neutral third party. This, by definition means that neutral third party (the government) has implied ownership of that land as they control the might that keeps it in your hands. While the legal system might say it's your land, it's a very entitled outlook to think this ownership is absolute.
Thus, if you don't like it, leave.

More like
A) I want to pay taxes! Yaaay!
B) I don't want to pay taxes! &lt;Society&gt; THEN GET THE HELL OUT!
Might not look like a democratic choice, but there it is, take it or leave it.

The question isn't what they could do, but rather why? Why would anyone bother? If anything, one superpower attempting to do it would be risky, as other countries not following suit could have dangerous consequences for that currency.

I'm going to assume you want discussion of why it appeals to me despite the fact that I don't think it can or should topple government control. I'll ignore the bias for now.
Basically, technology leans toward simplifying existing systems and cutting out the unnecessary fat. I see much of the money industry (banks, investments, etc.) as loaded with fat specifically (and possibly intentionally) designed to keep the poor out. Saving money is a losing proposition unless you have a lot of it to begin with - investing money is a losing proposition unless you have money to begin with, so on and so forth. BTC tends to take a practical swing at that. Anyone can save money in BTC for free, hopefully reliably. As BTC is inflationary, saving is a winning strategy that can possibly compete with investing. It simplifies money transfer as well, cutting out the need for money transfer fees and as an added bonus, puts the fees squarely in anyones hands who wish to help out. Etc. and so on.
As to why I think governments will allow this to happen? Because they wont have a choice. But it wont be the end of the world. After all, you can pay someone in cash or diamonds, can't you? All it costs in this case is the travel cost of the medium itself. It's the banks that will truly suffer in this case, not ultimately the governments.

Not only is this a misleading title, it might be from the hackers themselves. Why would they DDOS silk road? To manipulate the price of bitcoin since DDOSing the exchanges isn't working any more. I doubt anyone with the resources to pull off this attack is in it for the moral justification...

I just misread bitcoin for 'bacon' - and realized why reddit loves it so much. lol

The problem with your argument is that slavery is still technically better than death.
In a black and white world you would be right. But you are completely ignoring two essential facts:
1) These people can only afford to make these wages by relying on gov assistance. If there was no government assistance (which there shouldn't be for someone working as hard as you or I!) they would starve to death. This isn't a matter of altruism but basic math.
2) a 15% hike in wages is not equal to a 15% hike in prices. This theory assumes 0% profit, which is clearly ridiculous. It ignores shipping prices, taxes and profits. Investigations show that Walmart's profit margin is so large compared to their employee pay that they could literally pay their employees $15 an hour without a noticeable hit.

The government allows plenty of things that doesn't benefit them at all. I wont claim any government has our best interests at heart, but really bitcoin is a non-issue as far as any government is concerned. 
@_date: 2013-06-04 17:37:58
I think you're misdirecting your problems with politics at taxation. As a society, we need to pool a bit of money towards community goals - such as safety for individuals, easy and efficient travel so we can access food and goods, stuff like that. That's what taxation is about in its purest form, not us vs. the government. The problem with your theory is if we tried to accomplish goals like 'building roads' and 'hiring police' we run into two problems - it isn't done right out of selfishness or it isn't done at all out of greed.
For instance, if we left hiring police forces to private individuals, they'd start to resemble private security guards or, worse, private militias. If, in order to fix this, the government tried to regulate this, you'd see one of two things - either nothing, as without the power of police and other government agencies, no one listens to regulations anyways - or we would listen, and no one would have any real choice in what services to hire anyways, and would just pay for the cheapest and get bad service as an end result.

Why don't you decide to leave then? I hear Mexico is great this time of year. Or South America - could probably pay less taxes there.

I don't like calling it a bubble - it implies the price will drop back to nearly zero. It'll undergo a correction most likely - I'm gonna guess it'll hit $1800 and drop back to $1100 or something - but the net result is the price will probably stay high barring catastrophe. I think that's a safe assumption either way.
But yes, it does need to stabilize to attract widespread use. Maybe not completely, but 10x change in a day is a bit crazy. Until then though, there's always the option of converting directly back to FIAT if the retailer doesn't want to play 'speculator' on an open market. This makes using bitcoin very little risk - so I would say because of this bitcoin doesn't actually need to stabilize to succeed. Not yet anyway.
@_date: 2013-07-08 17:52:24
But the basic concepts are still there. Even if bitcoin were to be destroyed, other forms of value transfer are out there, and getting easier to set up and use by the day. Bitcoin is so far out in the open, crushing it would only push such transactions underground - making it harder to investigate...
@_date: 2013-06-04 19:53:32
Again, you're getting off topic. Problem is politics, not taxes or in theory regulation.
@_date: 2013-06-04 18:34:27
On an entirely unrelated note, I love how my other response actually points this out.
First, you can't claim absolute control over anything. You subscribe to a political system that allows you to claim ownership in theory, but in practice if you can't enforce absolute control unless you can physically defend it. 
Second, it sounds like it's democracy you have a problem with, not taxes. I suppose there are down sides to democracy, but unless you can come up with an alternative that's better, not much point in whining about it, huh?
@_date: 2013-06-04 20:12:24
No, that's exactly what it means. Ownership doesn't require you to get it in a morally correct method. If I hit a kid over the head with a bat and take his sandwich, that sandwich is MINE. Unless that kid can either get up and take it back by force, or get someone else to take it back for him, it's mine. Want proof that morals don't have a lot to do with it? 
The government is (theoretically) an extension of society. Government is you and me agreeing that if a bully hits you over the head with a bat, I'll get a bigger bat and help you get the sandwich back. Why? Because I expect you to do the same for me in the opposite case. Abolishing government will just put us back in the state of defencelessness, of which we need to come up with new solutions to fix. This is a physical metaphor, but it's applicable to a lot of other less direct examples. 
@_date: 2013-06-04 19:00:59
Might want to support your claim a bit more here. How does lack of government = lack of violence or coercion? I'd say the opposite actually. Go look at some third world societies that aren't under the jurisdiction of the local government - societies that have to go to war with eachother on a regular basis just so they get to keep control of the land they live on.
@_date: 2013-09-03 19:56:28
Thanks! It is a question worth asking one way or another.
@_date: 2013-12-17 14:34:04
All sarcasm aside - this does seem like you could take them to court. Maybe not individually, but I could see a class action lawsuit being a big threat here. After all, Chase is not acting in good faith here.
I'm not sure Libel is the pretence though. lol. I would still consult a lawyer though.
@_date: 2013-05-30 16:33:32
I think you have a horrible misconception here. Miners aren't adding value - not the way you're implying. They're actually deflating the total economy by a falling percentage. If there are 20% more bitcoins in the marketplace after a year, they're theoretically 20% easier to get, and therefore 20% cheaper.
You're not making more money: you're actually stealing a fraction of the value that's already in the marketplace. If the price is holding, it's because other sources of inflation are making up for the value lost by you making new currency.

I'm gonna upvote you both - bullco for illustrating the ignorance and Piper67 for demonstrating that it is ignorance.

No. Your parents agreed to it, and their parents, and so on up until whatever generation moved here or helped form the society. But surprise! You do still technically have the same choice they had! Don't like it? Get the hell out.
Democracy boy, do you speak it?
@_date: 2013-06-04 20:18:52
All I can say is free speech =/= free action. You have freedoms, but not absolute freedom. You are but one person in a large world, and you're going to have to accept that there are rules you need to follow if you wish to continue with the freedoms you currently have.

I think its safe to say if it ever drops that low, it probably wont recover.
@_date: 2013-12-13 15:48:54
umm... what exactly does bitcoin bath do? Sounds like a money laundering scheme.
@_date: 2013-11-08 11:53:43
Umm, you're quite paranoid. The tax code doesn't work like that for anything else, so why would it work like that for bitcoin? That, and you've just described a surveillance state nightmare, which is not what Canada is. You're being an alarmist.
Bitcoin is taxed both as a capital gain, and as a method of payment. It's not really a huge surprise. You're not taxed on your holdings, because it's not reasonable to track those holdings. End of story.
@_date: 2013-07-08 17:28:42
No one wants to pay taxes - but bitcoin isn't the answer to that at this point. Not any more than any other foreign currency is, as I described.
@_date: 2013-08-08 16:34:37
Technically, yes. Fighting one form of aggression with another form of aggression is still aggression. Saying otherwise is denial. Think of it like war: just because you're theoretically morally justified in killing someone doesn't mean you're not killing someone.
@_date: 2013-11-28 14:15:41
A few months ago, you had market experts more or less saying "bitcoin will probably fail... but if it succeeds, expect a conservative $10,000 or so price on a bitcoin." (Not a direct quote, but you get the idea)
I'm not betting on it hitting $2000 (or some arbitrary number), I'm betting on it succeeding. So yes, I will put some spare money into bitcoin and hope to see it worth a lot of money. In the mean time, I will work on finding better ways to use it.
@_date: 2013-08-21 15:38:53
lol, as much as I chuckle at the 'don't feed the crooks' responses - bitcoin will never get off the ground if we openly shun and hate all politicians. What you're talking about isn't lobbying though: it's an out and out bribe.
@_date: 2013-06-04 17:44:30
I think your missing something. We don't force people to pay them. We force people to pay them if they want to live here. Don't like it? Get out. Saying we're forcing you to pay taxes is like living at home with your mom and then yelling 'dictatorship' when she tells you to take out the damn trash. 
@_date: 2013-07-08 19:27:21
Again, no matter what boogiemen you chose, I don't think any group has a reason to shut down bitcoin, and I think it's safe to say that it's big enough that it wont be shut down accidentally. There's no reason for one super power to shut it done anyways - the only group that has to fear bitcoin is banks - since it doesn't require a central bank. 
@_date: 2013-06-04 18:00:56
You make it sound like by paying taxes we turn you into a mindless drone.
Look at it this way - you have to help pay for things you don't use - lets say medicaid. Some other guy that's very similiar to you uses medicaid but pays for something that he doesn't use but you do - lets say public transportation. The moral of the story? Saying you have to pay for things you don't use is a very close minded and selfish statement. Look at the long view.
@_date: 2013-11-08 14:09:15
Sorry, you're going to have to translate your point. Are you trying to equate the government imposing bail out regulations with tracking individual peoples holdings? Because if so its not hard to poke holes in your theory.
