I didn't mean to sound like any suing should happen, I just wanted to mention that fact.

It's out of necessity, I assume.  No paper trail or personal info required.  Any "established" money sending services probably don't want their business.

Exchanges don't stake their wallets so there's less chance of them performing a 51% attack.  Even a 30% attack has a good chance at being effective.

What about the DOJ?  They have &gt;50,000 btc

I'm guessing that's for a full rack (8U) at a data center.

Awesome!  Thanks

Heh, yeah

See you at the next exodus!

I don't use localbitcoins or btcjam and I got the email
@_date: 2015-04-26 22:23:25
Calm down bro
@_date: 2015-09-08 04:44:17
He's late to the party
  
@_date: 2015-04-16 19:36:49
Go outside or something

What price are your buy orders at?
@_date: 2015-03-04 03:38:25
As much as I appreciated your buy signal, leaking people's private e-mail is not only fucked up but it's illegal.

If you think about it though, *actual* conservatives (f those still exist) should be jumping all over bitcoin and its ideology.  They're the ones buying gold bullion and screaming that the dollar will collapse.
@_date: 2015-02-04 02:54:50
ah, cool
@_date: 2015-02-05 02:49:42
what a silly goose

I remember that for one of the auctions Tim Draper paid ~$650/BTC and the price at the time was in the low 600s or high 500s.
  Edit: I'm pretty sure that they keep the actual numbers confidential but the 650 figure was reported by other bidders.

I think this is an obvious solution to any type of content censorship in general and Kim seems to be pretty good at doing what he says he will.  He's been fighting for this kinda thing for years, and the tech is already out there to make it actually feasible.  Ethereum would be better for it though.

XCurrency has decentralized mixing but I don't really know what's going on with that

When you have that "Load failed" window open...
  Hit Control + shift + j
  then type/paste this:
    window.$host = "s2.bitcoinwisdom.com"
  then hit enter

That's fucking hilarious... sorta.
  Looking at porn you landed on a shit site and got so frustrated you went "fuck it I'll make it myself!".  Then as soon as the site went live all of that work culminated into you being able to rub one out finally.  Then you probably let out a huge sigh of relief and then detailed your journey here on reddit, where I was able to reply about what that must have been like.

People are already being tricked into giving their username/password, why wouldn't they be tricked into plugging the dongle in?
