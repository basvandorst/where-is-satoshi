I don't use the Electrum Wallet - do I need to? I've exported my Private Keys (dumpprivkey in the console) from Bitcoin Core and made a paper wallet. Do I just need to import that into the BitcoinABC/BCC wallet? (I'm using the official wallets in both cases)....I'll be honest, I don't understand what Electrum is for.
When I did a dump priv key - I gont just one long string of characters - is that correct?

Novice here - but I have my BTC bitcoins in the standard Bitcoin Core Wallet v 0.14.2 and I moved them there after adivce over private keys being on exchanges etc.
So nearly all of my coins are locally in my wallet. (There is sopme BTC left on Bittrex from an ANS sale yesterday - didn't get a chance to move them...and those have doubled up already - I can see the BCC wallet has a matching about of coins in it. So activity on the exchange seems to have gone ok so far.
What I'm confused about is how I get matching BCC from the BTC coins in my wallet?
Do I need to go to bitcoinabc.org and download their 0.14.6 wallet and let that sync and then import my private keys?
I'm rather confused about the whole process and things appear to be moving rather quickly today - as well as up and down.
Thanks for any assistance.

Still sounds like a bizarre string of words...I'll take the last four. Thank you

Thank you for the advice. You know dumpprivkey sounds really really wrong to us normies. Sounds like bad things will happen :-/ Yikes.

Ok..Ive read much of this thread...but not all of it, but I have already moved my exchange Bitcoins to my Bitcoin Core Wallet...is this the same thing as "having control over your private keys". I read the bit about private keys not being the seed etc, but I'm left a little confused. What exactly are your private keys, how do you get access to them and have I done the right thing moving them to Bitcoin Core on my local machine.
Only been trading and investing for a few months and so I'm a little confused as to what my private keys are.
Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks
