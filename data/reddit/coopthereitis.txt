Would be amazing if all the early adopters and normal people sold their bitcoin which was gobbled up by banks and corporations and in the end they were the ones left holding the bag for once when it tanked

Definitely don’t need to put the word “still” in there. Open up your calculator app. Type in the money you have now between all your accounts. Now multiply that by 800. How would that affect your life?
That’s what this guy did.

If you are going to do it this way then the safe thing to do is claim it as capital gains.  Much less likely you get audited.

The guy made her get her car/purse. After he killed her he also stabbed 2 other women before being caught.  Google Amy Lord in Boston if you'd like - it was a few years ago so I'm not entirely sure of all the details.  Just adding to the point that OP makes that there are some fucked up people out there and, if they can pull a weapon and get you to get your car/purse and drive around to a bunch of different ATMs, they could very easily get you to transfer your crypto.  At least with the ATM scenario you are forced into the public eye and they might not be able to get ALL of your money because of transaction limits.  
@_date: 2017-12-27 00:06:32
I didn't say *you* specifically. Why, do you not plan on paying your taxes?

Dollars and euros are considered currency. BitCoin is considered an asset.

Even with current laws a typical BTC for LTC likely can't be used as a "like kind exchange" which is the loophole I seem to hear most people refer to (please correct me if you are referring to something different).  Real estate for other real estate is a like kind exchange but gold coin for silver coin is not so it would be hard to argue that BTC for LTC is.  Also it needs either needs to be done directly between 2 parties or with the use of an escrow agent between 2 direct parties like a lawyer so exchanging BTC for LTC on somewhere like Coinbase would exclude it right off the bat.  To do it legally you would also need to file form 8824 and get it accepted. If you do not file the form or if your request is rejected then you owe capital gains taxes on the transaction.  So in reality, the current law states that people who did this likely owe those taxes unless they went about it in a very specific way, likely with the advice from a tax attorney or CPA.

Free electronic money transfer in the US. It's PayPal so it should be rolled out worldwide at some point. Pretty cool stuff.
@_date: 2017-12-27 00:04:29
Do you understand what I am saying to you? No one was actually using the 1031 exception (unless they set their transactions up in a very specific and well documented way and even then no one knows if it would get rejected or not because the law wasn't clear.  The new law just clarifies that they are definitely not like kind exchanges).  It wasn't a viable way to avoid taxes in the long haul anyway since you have to report to them that you exchanged your BTC for LTC so then they know you have LTC and will be waiting for you to sell that.  In reality it would only be useful in trying to avoid paying capital gains on a lateral exchange like that at that time so you could defer it to the future and potentially claim it as a long term capital gain rather than short term.  
So essentially what I'm saying is that this tax ruling is nothing knew - it's getting rid of a "loophole" that wasn't used and wasn't a way to avoid paying taxes anyway.  Lying about this to the IRS is no different than the lying that white collar dirt bags do that send them to prison.  
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:24:41
Congrats! Invest that money somewhere else and don’t worry about what BTC does. An investment where you make money is a successful one - now keep the ball rolling!

I think they want to make sure they can tax you if you realize the gains on your bitcoin through purchases. Seems reasonable - otherwise people could use the cards for tax evasion.

Gold is still extremely valuable in electronics, medical equipment, jewelry etc. What is BitCoin’s value outside of a speculative investment if it’s not being used as a currency?
@_date: 2017-12-25 22:11:38
Exactly - there is bitcoin with big blocks and bitcoin with small blocks.  If bigger blocks are the answer like you seem to believe then why hate bcash so much? Just trying to understand

You pay based on your income tax bracket, 39% is the highest. So it depends on your yearly income. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 17:09:18
Additional point - if you bought and sold it without holding it for over a year you are taxed at your income tax rate which is very likely above 15% so be wary of the buy\sell dates.  
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:23:49
Yowza man but at least you’re ahead of the curve on these things. Seems like a good amount of people here are looking for a way to commit tax fraud.

But what about the giant BitCoin mines in China that get all of their electricity from coal-fired power plants? 
@_date: 2017-12-27 00:27:41
Exactly - it's pretty difficult to document and all it really does is defer your gains from this year when you exchanged them for other crypto to the future when you exchange them for cash.
@_date: 2017-12-26 23:39:50
They removed all like kind exchanges except real estate which clarifies their position on crypto but it doesn't target just crypto as a lot of "like kind exchanges" were also removed. Also, previously it was never clarified whether or not that could be claimed because no one was actually doing it the correct way to even test it.  Less than 1,000 people paid taxes on their crypto exchanges and there's no evidence anyway even filed an 8824 that was successfully accepted under section 1031.  Probably because, if you did that, you would need to prove what it was converted to and then you would just need to pay the government later when you converted your LTC.  What people were really just doing is using the idea of the law to make themselves feel better about it. Though I'm sure we will find out this year if someone does actually try to file form 8824.

I think they are looking for people who used $20K of BitCoin to pay for something (AKA sold it). BitCoin is not a currency based on the US tax code - it's property so it's treated like an investment. 
Because of this, when you buy something with BTC it's technically 2 transactions - you are selling your BTC then using the proceeds to buy whatever you bought.  So if you bought BTC for $500 and sold for $20,000, you need to pay capital gains taxes on the $19,500 investment income you made.  If you held it for over a year you pay the 15% capital gains tax or $2,950.  If you held it for less than a year you pay whatever your tax bracket is which could be as high as 39%.  What the IRS is doing is looking for people who liquidated over $20K in BTC.  With the ledger they would know what they paid for it so they could then make them pay the capital gains tax on it. 
Most mutual funds already report that info and issue you a 1099 which facilitates paying those taxes so that's probably what will happen with BTC if it remains classified as property.
@_date: 2017-12-26 23:02:04
No - essentially buying something with it or changing it to another crypto is a taxable event the same as "cashing out".  So if you bought 2 BTC in January at $1,000 a piece then converted to Litecoin while it was worth $15,000 that would trigger a taxable event and you would owe capital gains taxes on that $28,000.  Since you held it for less than a year you would be taxed at your income bracket level (the average person making between ~$35K and ~$100K is taxed at 25%.  So you would owe $7,000 in taxes even if you didn't spend that Litecoin on anything.

Lol another dude who literally didn’t read the post he’s commenting on. This post is all about why he needed the money because he *wasn’t* set for life. After this resulting fundraising drive he probably is. I’m just applauding the man for taking a topic and making money off it without necessarily doing it himself like people who are paid to pick winners in sports. And as others has pointed out, he’s already cashed out a ton of that BTC for cash cuz he’s smart. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:29:14
The fact that most countries classify it as property rather than currency is a problem.  It’s real use right now is as a store of value since it’s not practical to use for small transactions and no one is using it as an actual unit of measurement to compare the worth of items.  It’s a long way off from becoming an actual currency and, as long as it’s taxed like an asset, it will likely remain an investment vehicle rather than a realistic means to exchange goods since there is a huge tax benefit to hold it for longer than a year vs buying and selling same year. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:02:30
Didn’t the leaders of Coinbase denounce any insider trading and say they would investigate/fire whoever it was? Seems the uproar is more over them adding Bitcoin Cash.

I personally would still wonder what the appeal is. The US government is pushing hard to make sure they collect taxes on sales of it which is pulling the lid off the anonymous side of it. As OP said there are cheaper options available (in the US Venmo is a free way to transfer funds electronically. It’s not even currently classified as a currency in most countries. So what exactly is the functional advantage of it vs fiat? People always bring up the philosophical reasons but it would need to essentially supplant fiat for that to be realized.

With this amount of activity you may be best off by creating an LLC where your tax rate should be lower (especially if you plan to continue operating in this fashion). I would solicit the help of a tax professional as they will likely save you more than you'll spend on them and keep you from being audited.

When you buy something with BTC it's technically treated as 2 transactions. You selling your BTC for cash equivalent then buying the item with the equivalent. The BTC sale is the taxable event.

The Stratton Oakmonts of crypto will start popping up all over.  “We offer Bitcoin, Ether, and now PumpCoin - the newest and best of them all!”  They buy a huge quantity when it’s low, market the shit out of it, sell it, and let it go to nothing.
I’ve already taken my profits on this train and maybe I’ll dabble here and there but I’m not gunna be caught holding the bag.  If cryptocurrency takes over the currency market (and I hope it does) then I’ll exchange the dollars I’ve made to crypto at that point.
