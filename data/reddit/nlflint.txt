There are web logs of the requests, so using a publicly available block explorer does leak some private info. It can be known, albeit with weak confidence, that the owner of that public BTC address is owned by the person at the IP address of the request. And if you look up a few public address from that same IP, that those public BTC addresses might be linked, thus further identifying who owns what on the block chain.
For authorities, those web logs are leads that could be followed up on e.g. subpoena the ISP for personal info/address of the person at that IP address, or in the case of an authoritarian state, send your goons to break down the door and kidnap everyone.

Trying to understand how the signature in P2PKH is created and verified. Using this here: 
Here what I think, is this true?
How sig is made:
1. Copy of new transaction is made (call it txcopy)
2. scriptsigs (input scripts) dont exist yet.
3. raw representation of txcopy is run through sha256 to produce a hash
4. hash is run through sha256 (second time) to produce final-hash
5. final-hash and private key (matching output Primary key)  are run through secp256k1 to produce the signature.
6. signature and public key hash are saved on input script sig in new transaction.
7. repeat for each remaining input on the txcopy.
How sig is verified:
1. Copy of new transaction is made (call it txcopy)
2. scriptsigs (input scripts) are blown away on txcopy
3. raw representation of txcopy is run through sha256 to produce a hash
4. hash is run through sha256 (second time) to produce actual final-hash
5. signature and public key are run through secp256k1 to produce an expected final-hash
6. Expected and actual final-hash are compared
7. If they match, input is good. Else, entire transaction is bad. skip any other inputs.
8. Repeat for each input in the transaction
9. If all inputs are good, transaction is good (assuming all other validations pass)

Do you have a link to benchmarks? I've done a cursory search, but can't find anything compelling.  I think it be a fascinating article, and I don't think one exists yet. I'm interested to see:
1. Affect of storage tech: SSD (SATA) vs HDD vs NVME vs SD-card
2. CPU: intel vs amd vs Pi2 vs Pi3
3. Network bandwidth
The Pi is pretty I/O limited. I've read that the entire bus total (USB/SDcard/network) is limited to 480mbps (60 Megabyes/sec). At that rate, and SDD has little benefit over HDD. Maybe some workloads will benefit, like random access. But would love to see the affects on a benchmark.

Bitcoin is malleable. Any change to the way bitcoin works can be rolled out if there is consensus among nodes. If deflation causes a problem, and in your example, extreme problems, then a BIP could be crafted to change the block reward schedule, and increase or extended them to whenever.

I fully sync’d in ~7 hours. That was w/ Sata3 SSD, a 5 year old 3.7ghz 4-core Xeon, and gigabit fiber. Im pretty sure an SSD makes a big difference, but it would be nice to see some controlled benchmarks.
I don’t see how the blockchain would kill an SSD. A 1 meg block is generated every 10 mins. That’s not much data. It’s mostly read operations and updating some indexes. With modern wear leveling it won’t wear out, if that’s what you mean by kill it.

The blockchain is replicated around the world. As long as there is one copy of the blockchain and source code, it can survive. A single EMP has limited range, and won't reach the whole world. Therefore, one EMP != game over.
Also, an EMP over a large area, like the US, won't kill all electronics. The wave won't propagate in an even pattern. The waves deflect and refract off of all kinds of materials, so lots of areas will be left unaffected, while others nearby will be completely destroyed.

The limit isn't explicit, but implied from the block reward schedule. The schedule describes how the reward decreases with time (e.g. the reward is cut in half every 4 years), and this determines when it reaches zero. As others have stated, you have to get the hacked code into over 51% of the miners and nodes currently operating. The source code is too closely monitored, and the release process is slow. It's not possible to sneak it in.
However, it's not inconceivable that &gt;50 years in the future, the community decides that the block reward schedule should be changed. It would have to be a community decision to raise the limit, or else you risk a fork.
Now, there are other ways to create "new" bitcoin like fractional reserve banking, which is possible with bitcoin, or any store of value. Fractional reserve banking is another form of money creation and a source of inflation.

Yep, a related "problem" is called the "dust limit". I think, right now, the dust limit is 546 satoshis. Any amount less can't be spent, as the transaction won't be relayed (by default config), and so won't make it to miners. The config can be changed, but vast majority of nodes accept the defaults.

As for the story. It's not an argument for or against bitcoin. He could have had his 2MM in bitcoin, and held it in Mt. Gox, but he would still be out 2MM. If anything it's a lesson about trusting a custodian which apples to bitcoin, fiat, and gold.
Btw, I think some folks are better off trusting a custodian with their bitcoin, because it will be safer than if they managed (mis-managed) their own keys, or get hacked. Look what happened to those folks on Electrum. Scary.

You can, but you'll have to be part of a pool to really get any coin and you need ASIC hardware to do it. There's upfront costs for the hardware, significant electricity costs, perhaps A/C costs from the heat generated, and a pool fee.

I disagree. Politicians can still be paid-off in bitcoin, for their corrupt deeds.

The block chain is ~210GB. At full 1 mbps bandwidth thats ~21 days to download. Of course, you want to do other things with your bandwidth. If it only sync'd while you slept (~8hrs a day, instead of 24hrs/day), then that's ~62 days or 2 months.
Once you are sync'd, new blocks are 1 megabyte in size, and mined every 10 minutes. At 1 mbps that's about 5-10 seconds to download a new block (every 10 mins). That's the bandwidth to stay sync'd.
Additionally, there is other peer-to-peer traffic like propagating transactions and new blocks to other nodes. You might be able to disable this propagation, because you don't need it to just verify your own stuff, but I'm not sure if or how.
You could easily maintain a node once you are sync'd. Initial sync is the hard part, but possible. Another way: if you know and trust someone locally with an up-to-date blockchain, then you can copy it from them over USB/HDD by hand. There's some wikis (google it) on how to do this.

I expect global hash rate to crash shortly after. The rewards won't be worth it in many cases, but depends on individuals energy cost. Risky for 51% attack. Competing with huge subsidized Chinese miners will be difficult. It could help them capture more hashing power share. I don't see price doubling to make up for loss in reward either. Sellers unloading as it rises will make ample supply available and prevent price from rising too much.

If the algo is changed to be quantum resistant, then bitcoin crypto won’t be broken, so my point still stands. However, this leads to an interesting implication for Satoshi’s addresses. Even if everyone moves their coin into new quantum resistent UTXOs, to protect them from quantum computers, all the old lost coin and possibly all of Satoshi’s original coins will up be for grabs, and that would be a nice payday.
Changing to a new  algo won’t change past blocks. They will still exist. It would be done in a way that is backwards compatible, like a new transaction type that co-exists with existing transaction types. It would be left up to each owner to close out their old vulnerable UTXOs, and move them into the new algo. All old UTXOs will be gobbled up by attackers. This all assuming contemporary crypto gets broken.
If the crypto was broken unexpectedly and without preparations, then the community would probably agree to a re-org, after a solution is found.

Banking and crypto currency are not mutually exclusive. Banks can hold crypto, and engage in fractional reserve banking with it. This misunderstanding shows in many of the arguments the rappers make against/for each other. Back in Hamilton's day the US was still on the gold standard. So all Hamilton's arguments for a central bank work fine with crypto too. I don't think Hamilton and Satoshi's "ideas" clash in anyway; they are orthogonal. The video sounds cool, but it's spreading misunderstandings of crypto currencies. I could go on.
For example:
* Cash, Gold, and Bitcoin are permission-less and decentralized
* Banks can hold cash, gold or bitcoin and be liable for it
@_date: 2019-09-06 16:13:00
Permission-less is not about siezability. It means nobody needs permission to participate. Cash is permission-less. You don't need permission to trade cash for services in a back alley, and a central authority can't block the transaction.

From the article:  


I disagree, there will be no windfall. The moment bitcoin crypto is broken, it becomes worthless. Nobody will give you anything for it. Breaking the crypto just destroys it.

It's a strange way to phase it. The block reward schedule gradually goes to zero. For example, the per-block-reward will be 0.00000001 BTC for the final 4 years, and only 0.00000002 BTC for 4 years before that. It will take ~41 years to mine the final 1 BTC, with each block rewarding the miner only a handful of sats. Transactions fees will significantly out weight the block reward, and we'll all be long dead by that time.

Anyone bought bitcoin locally with cash, like craigslist? Is that just asking to get robbed? What's good strategy/tactics to go about it (how safeguard self, how to transact, what is enough confirmation)?
My idea:  
1) First, no large amounts (&gt;$1000).   
2) Set expectations with seller: You want to meet for ~30-40 minutes to wait for a few confirms. Show all cash upfront. Half when seller submits transaction, other half after 2-3 confirms.  
3) Must meet in day time, at public location, with people and cameras present. A starbucks for example.  
4) Have internet connection ready to check transaction status, fee, and # confirms.  
5) Force seller to use high fee. Figure out high fee, and tell seller what fee to use. This makes transaction confirm fastest. Fee will come out of your share.  
6) Wait for confirms, then give 2nd half of cash, depart, done.
Not sure what biggest risk is. Probably seller purposefully screwing up the transaction fee (super low fee) on purpose, then taking half of the cash. Then seller double spends 10 mins later with way higher fee. You're left with half your cash gone, and no bitcoin.
