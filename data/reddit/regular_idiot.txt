Not if they want to destroy their career. A reputable licensed professional would have too much to lose. If OP truly did not know enough to do it on her own, then if she had to get help, better one who has incentive not to cheat her.

Believe me I think attorneys are mostly crooks but there is a fine line between charging an arm and a leg and actually stealing client funds. You are correct there are plenty of attorneys out there who have done that, and been disbarred, etc. This all depends on how big the estate is and how much potential BTC there is. If not that much then none of this is really worth it and certainly not worth hiring an attorney. But if there is enough I would hire a reputable sized firm to help. A reputable firm (not some sole proprietor nobody in a dark alley) is not going to have attorneys that regularly steal client funds. If they do, they have assets so you could sue the crap out of them and get back whatever they took.
Plus since the guy died there are potential estate and income tax issues to be concerned with. An attorney or CPA usually helps with preparing the inventory of assets in an estate anyway.

In 6 months the average joe won't remember Mt Gox. This article is spot on that a bunch of newer more legitimate exchanges will take the place of the crappy ones. With more legitimacy comes price stability, and that is part of what is needed to get more widespread adoption.

I would find a CPA or Attorney or CFA (someone licensed) to assist. She would then have recourse if they did happen to try any funny business.

No you don't and I own gold and silver. But those haven't taken off as currency. If people want Bitcoin to take off as currency, then the government is going to regulate it, bottom line.

Not sure why Ron Paul/Peter Schiff/etc are not on board with digital currency yet. I'm pretty sure in Schiff's 1st book he talks about a future where he imagines you have physical gold held in a giant vault and you pay with things with your "gold credit card" which deducts fractions of oz of gold from your account as you spend.... sounds familiar.

If bitcoin is truly going to succeed that's just not going to happen.

If you are a casual investor in Bitcoin it comes down to whether Bitcoin will be treated as a foreign currency under the foreign currency rules (IRC 988) or as a capital asset (IRC 1221) and subject to capital gains. You are going to be better off in any gain scenario declaring it as capital gains. There is a reasonable basis to do so as a capital asset is defined as any asset except for a list of items detailed in IRC 1221, none of which apply to Bitcoin (to the casual investor... not dealers). IRC 988 only comes into play when you are dealing with "non-functional" currency. Since the IRS hasn't come out and said Bitcoin is currency, and since a lot of people treat it more like a security than currency (don't spend it), I believe you are within reason to declare your gains as capital gains.
What is your risk? That you are wrong and the IRS audits and reclassifies it as foreign currency (ordinary income). You would potentially have late payment penalties and interest. You could be subject to the Accuracy Related Penalty IRC 6662 but that only applies to negligence or disregard of rules or regulations. Since there are no regulations and no guidance, this is unlikely to apply. In most other situations where guidance has been lacking you are typically free to go with best judgement under the Code until they issue more guidance.
