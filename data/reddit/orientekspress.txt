But it was never due to reaching limitations in Bitcoin. You will never convince general public on cryptocurrencies. Blockchains will be useful but tokens will be novelty. You can't have a currency that is only accepted by a million people here and there. Bitcoin is libertarian but general public wants to feel safe and secure which is never possible with cryptocurrencies, ironically even though it is supposed to be the most secure. Government regulations have more effect on cryptocurrencies than cryptocurrencies have on government. Hence will never win that battle. I don't mean a libertarian digital currency shouldn't exist. But most people don't want to live in anarchy. It's that simple.

You have the western spoiled brat mentality. There are people that can't read or write and not have cell phones, probably in billions. The only problem you think is the currency we use? Kids like you have no idea how this world works and how government collects taxes and how that contributes to your safety and well being. The solution is to end the corruption not create a different currency that 99% of the world population do not understand how it works.

I guess efficiency is a concept which your small mind cannot grasp.

Mining will not be needed in the future. Well, that's when bitcoin becomes obsolete. Instead of increasing hash power bitcoin core should concentrate on scaling and wasting less energy for difficulty of the algorithm. With this being said I think the blocks will be mined and should be mined in less time; in a minute for example. Once all the bitcoin is minted they should concentrate on reissuing ever lost coins.

Kids like you is the reason why blockchains have a bad rep.

Stocks are also overvalued. They will not end well.

It's not a misunderstanding. The whole market cap of every blockchain can be purchased very easily by the same people who run the financial system atm, or can be outlawed. My approach is more realistic and probable in the future. I appreciate your untainted idealism but we don't always use the best tools for doing things in general. We live in a world of power struggles and the order of what should happen for change is different. Governments need to collapse before a financial structure change. As long as someone needs to convert their crypto to any government currency it only adds an extra step to the whole process. Therefore a government crypto will be the only ones that exist. It will probably take 5-10 years until they realize how inefficient taxation is with all the digital assets flowing around. It's not a matter of should it exist? the question is will it?

What bitcoin fanboys don't understand is that, they are only benefiting blockchains. Bitcoin will be obsolete over time when the governments issue their own digital currency. Don't forget that most of these are open source. They can be implemented by anyone. These sorts of media stunts are great for blockchains but don't use these for pumping the value of bitcoin any more than what it already is.

I'm sure when you say fucking in every sentence, it really makes everyone understand better.

Blockchains will be integrated into everything.

You can already use both as necessary. Choosing one is a stupid idea

i don't think anybody claims that blockchains are not going to be used. Bitcoin is not the best representation of blockchains. I'm not even gonna list all the shortcomings. Money btw already is a digital currency otherwise you wouldn't be able to use a credit card. Blockchain tokens will only be used when governments implement the open source code into what you call fiat money. Bitcoin community is stubborn and very conservative for a bunch of people claiming to be progressive. They are clinging onto a dinosaur version of blockchains for their dear life. Bitcoin will be a bust. Blockchains on the other hand are here to stay.

Governments will have implemented distributed ledgers into their currency systems. Private cryptos are only paving the way for government to make use of it one day. The fact that these are all open source makes it easy to duplicate and adapt by governments, given their potential workforce.

I am not comparing them. Just making my warning for the threat ahead. I am only commenting on stocks. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 23:05:52
I think now you understand better what my comment was about. stocks under dow index are overpriced as much as 30% IMO. Cryptocurrencies will be the future. But very differnet than what /bitcoin think it will happen. since it is all open source, governments will issue cryptocurrencies and they will eliminate money. It will be the credit system you see in futuristic movies where they exchange credits for things digitally on their built-in interface. The future is basically here. In a decade we will see all of it realized.

So it can take 3 years to see 20K again?

There are 2.5 billion people without cell phones. Since we are throwing random stats out there.

It seems to me that nobody should buy any currency with a credit card. If you have money you can convert it. But you never buy a different currency or do any investment on credit. They let you do it, but a responsible investor never should. You're investing money that you don't have. You should only invest what you can afford to lose.

Bitcoin is also centralized through the whole coin exchange schemes and people like the twins. What do you understand from centralization and what use do you think it has?

Apart from her ignorance on Bitcoin, she does have some valid points on pump and dumps and fraud ICOs.
