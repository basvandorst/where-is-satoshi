Oh for fuck's sake.. YEAH. I JUST WANT AN ECHO CHAMBER. DOWN WITH ANY DISSENTING OPINION.... Please.
Just as they have their own opinion I have mine. My opinion is that bitching about someone not doing the most economically positive action they could is stupid. I cite other examples in which people waste economic activity to point out other ridiculous things you could be bitching about for people not doing.
How you managed to spin my comment into being some sort of pro circle jerk only viewpoint is astounding and really goes to show how strong the anti-circle jerk circle jerk really is. You actively seek out the circle jerk where there is none.
You sound like a soccer mom just waiting to be offended by anything. Please go back to watching The View.

Some people appreciate function over form.

All the whiners in this thread tick me off. Yes the phones could have been donated. So fucking what.
 Instead of going out to eat on Valentine's day, you could go work for a homeless shelter. Instead of buying video games, you could be buying food for starving kids in X country! In fact, the time you are spending on reddit bitching about this thread, you could be volunteering to help your community!
You guys really need to get off your internet high horse. This guy is giving away phones that can support bitcoin apps to people who are stuck in Apple land, and we get entertaining videos out of it. Just appreciate it for what it is and stop looking every gift horse in the mouth.

Why would someone in want a phone that can readily support bitcoin apps over one that bans them? I want you to think as hard as you can and see if you can figure it out.
