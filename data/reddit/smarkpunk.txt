Sure. You know that I talked to the mods right? They allowed me to post all that because we paid a lot of money for the license. So please, stop trying to bring me down because I work harder than you. Based on your history it seems like all you do is call people out and bring negativity into this world. Grow up. And yes, I am going to ignore you, I don't need toxicity in my life.

You're right, I'm just hyped because I averaged out my BTC this morning and I feel like we're back.

Or wait...maybe I'm the alt...maybe I don't exist. Maybe I'm the robot behind this money making machine!!! 
Look, dude, I own crypto's and I own BTC. I own a lot more too if you'd like to know. I'm a hustler and I am proactive at trying to make money. You are just another troll.

Cute how you think that's mine because it isn't. I'm sure you have enough time on your hands to even do an IP search on both to figure out if it is or not. Have a good day sir.

Thanks dude, I appreciate it.

For sure. Slide in my DM's, drop your number, I'll FaceTime you showing my accounts. Not gonna let my information be out there. But then again, you might screenshot it. Anyway, done wasting time with this. Peace.

Also, make sure to go on all my chair posts. And go and attacks the 25,000 karma I’ve received as well, seems like you at 133 is really nothing.

Going well, thank you. Anyway, if you want to keep looking into my life I can send you my SSN as well. If you want me to delete this post to make your day better I totally can. You want it?

I’m not attractive enough to have my face all over Reddit. It’s an insecurity thing, just wanted to show off where I found it (someone posted it on another crypto sub). Sorry if this offended you.

Why are you assuming that person's gender? Seems a bit mean.
