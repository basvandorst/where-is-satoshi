Pretty minor, but that's a strange definition of "bad investment" as well. 
How many days would bitcoin have beat a standard (virtually risk-free) 2.5% annualized return?

That's a lot of time and work investment to buy some coins. 
Probably would have been easier to hire a US lawyer to form a trust that you can purchase bitcoin through.

Although it looks like that gray line is a price trend line, it's actually graphing total supply. 
Price is displayed in a log scale on the left side of the chart while supply is displayed in a linear scale on the right side of the chart. Any relationship they seem to have is probably by chance.

It's an archaic version of tripled

All else being the same, it probably wouldn't have much impact. What's nice about BTC is that you can purchase tiny fractional pieces, so all that matters is the proportional relationship of cost, fees, and profit. 
One thing to consider would be the reaction of newly wealthy retail speculators. They may be more protective of their newfound wealth, and as a result could contribute more to volatility. 
Bitcoin retail investors are probably already more risk-tolerant and gambling-prone than investors in traditional asset classes, and I imagine that a major price run would contribute to their mental stress. One piece of information that could be useful to find and track is the proportion of retail investors versus institutional funds.

In this model, here's how it goes down:
Institutions sell high, but push their sell orders steadily downwards. After a certain price threshold is reached, panic ensues, and because of various quirks of the market (its speculative nature, its dubious value, its emotional culture and general inexperience of participants) the price continues to freefall for a while. 
Eventually, institutions buy back in at what they consider a low price, rinse and repeat. 
I'm sure anyone doing this with 100s of millions of dollars has a slightly more complex scheme, but that's the gist.
