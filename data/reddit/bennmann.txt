I hope bitcoin starts to cause innovation in the energy sector in China in 2016 in order to support independent mining farms.

Testing the beta now with Windows.
VMWare player (free, google it) -&gt; xubuntu image freshly downloaded (also free) 20GB reserved in VMWare.
Followed the Linux instructions in the virtual machine and all it's up and running. Took significant time to set up xubuntu, but it's idiot proof. It then took at least 15 minutes to install the OpenBazaar web app on my gaming PC, downloading dependencies around 1.2MB/sec. 
After the tutorial, you obviously have to wait for the "started OpenBazaar web app at  message in terminal before you can launch  in firefox in your virtual xubuntu.
EDIT 1: Looks like sometimes you have to refresh you browser page to make settings appear and interact.... like very often... not sure if bug or user error, still poking.

Your Windows friends can do this if they have the hard drive space and the time, it is free and only beginner-intermediate difficulty:

You're boss is very smart and has legitimate concerns, and you should acknowledge that with him and address each individual concern:
1- Mining pools are not the same as miners, whom have a history of switching pools in a decentralized way when any given pool becomes too powerful (
2- A few people do own the community websites. Other news sources function to help keep this in check (major news outlets like Forbes). Admittedly, the press becomes a problem again if Bitcoin becomes the World Reserve currency (press centralization in combination with community leader collusion).
3- Currently this is the most serious concern your boss has raised. We are watching how the decentralized network of miners respond to what is basically a dev civil war over certain topics not appropriate for discussion here, which will determine how this concern impacts Bitcoin as a whole.

I would be less pessimistic at "one shot per generation".
But yes, I'd say if it fails now who can say how long before someone tries the great cryptocurrency experiment again?

Who would want to risk paying more dollars for less gas?
The dollar tangibly fluctuates as well. We Iraq to start accepting bitcoin for oil.

If we ever reach Type II civilization as per this scale:
then bitcoins would be replaced by the mass and energy of the universe. E=mc2 coin, much better than having a currency dependent on computing a ledger and wasting the finite energy of the universe doing so.

Rebuttals: 
1) the government could corner (buy) many bitcoins in the next few years and tie the Dollar to bitcoin and then only accept dollars for government services and taxes. This would be like when the dollar was tied to gold.
2) the government could legislate bitcoins to be illegal (this seems far fetched to me)
3) Let's go all the way, what if the government decided bitcoins were the new national currency of the US and slowly phazed out the federal reserve and the dollar and then declared you could pay taxes in either bitcoins or dollars. They could then take you to court for tax evasion *even if* all your business is in bitcoin and send in police, ect. to seize your assets if you don't pay them - sure your funds are safe, but your stuff? Fair game. 
Just playing devil's advocate.
