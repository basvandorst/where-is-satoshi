"Additionally, understand that economics is a quasi science. your point of view is not the only one, and that many very intelligent economists disagree with your opinion."
Sooo many intelligent people who follow a science that isn't really a science don't agree?
Also, Adam Smith (and others probably but he's the one I know best) said that UNregulated capitalism leads to concentration of wealth. Wealth is like mass. In the same way mass distorts space-time to bring things towards it (gravity), wealth distorts the "space-time" of the market to attract more wealth. That may be a clumsy analogy, but my background is in physics, not Econ.
Also, don't economies of scale inherently prohibit competition from little start ups?

I agree entirely concerning statism and how its essentially authoritarian capitalism.
However, I think you'll find that economists from Adam Smith right up to Paul Krugman agree that in an unrestricted environment, the "natural forces" that govern the movement and use of capital will eventually result in at least some amount of concentration, which will in turn slant market forces towards those who already have wealth.
And that's "pure" capitalism. Never mind the corrupt, nepotistic, war profiteering, genocidal, semi-feudal corporate system we have in place now.

He is talking about BTC-e and Novacoin. supposedly BTC-e took 100,000 pre-mined novacoins in exchange for listing Novacoin on their exchange. The thought is that BTC-e is planning to pump Novacoin and then dump their 100k, crashing the market and cashing out big.
This isn't exactly a scam, more like insider trading. If you mine Novacoin and immediately trade for btc or ltc, you should be fine. Actually, if you can get out before BTC-e blows thier wad, you could probably make a nice profit, since as the story spreads more people are going to look to bank off the artificial rise of Novacoin. Just make sure you get out before BTC-e sells, or youll be left with lots of worthless Novacoins.
EDIT: unless of course this isnt what he was talking about at all.

OK you got me on the wealth equals mass thing, but it seems that you're saying that economies of scale DO push out small competitors when dealing with physical goods, which (right now) is what matters. Until we can 3D print food, anyway. 
In a completely deregulated economy, what stops one group of people from accumulating control of all the food? Especially if those people buy a private army and all the roads and trucks that distribute that food?

Your mistake lies in assuming the unregulated capitalism is not a top-down approach. Unless we literally start from Zero (nuclear war, environmental annihilation), there are already top dawgs, and they stay there. Removing regulations would just make it much easier to stay there.
@_date: 2013-05-20 18:01:34
thats because you're a libertarian. Capitalism is to libertarians what Papal infallibility is to catholics.
Adam smith and many other early economists, as well as a great many modern non-Austrian school economists, described how unregulated capitalism naturally leads to the consolidation of wealth, which in turn skews market forces towards those who already have wealth. In fact, when Adam Smith talked about the "invisible hand" he was actually saying it was a BAD thing, and that regulation/intervention is needed to ensure that a few people don't end up with everything. So really, libertarianism is actually advocating centralization in the long run.
I doubt this small post will convince anyone dogmatic about their philosophy, but anything I can do to steer people away from obeying an "ism" is good.
@_date: 2013-05-18 23:35:00
actually, given Capitalism's tenancy to cause the massive concentration of wealth, I would say its just Anarchist.

...can you really care so much about economic theory that you ignore the rest of reality?
"My ability to grow and sell food on my own land."
Monsanto's Terminator Seeds. Next!
"What does the private army have to do with anything?"
In a completely deregulated economy, there is no public police force or military. That means that once I get control of the food supply, I can use my private army to shoot you in the face if you don't buy my terminator seeds. Next!
"The roads and trucks would be worthless if they are charging too high a price; they won't make enough money to sustain themselves." 
Again, you seem to think that "natural" economic forces will control everything. This is nonsense. My original point about an unregulated economy is that it NATURALLY lead to consolidation of wealth, and once that wealth in consolidated, there is no mechanism to re-distribute it other than market forces, which are heavily skewed towards the guy who already has the food and the army. There is nothing to prevent forced monopolies. Anyone who tries to use the roads to ship their own food gets shot! Next!
"True economics requires balance (just like nature)." I'm not even going to dignify this with a full response, but quickly: "True Economics"? How exactly to you tell which one is true? Modern economist can't even agree over Keynes Vs. Friedman, and if you were to look at economic theory 50 years ago or 50 years from now, the conclusions would be totally different. What about Marxist or fascist economics? The Inka of Peru ran a totally command economy with no money and no markets for hundreds of years, and were incredibly successful doing it. What about eco-economics? Capitalism is well on its way to completely destroying the environment. Does that sound like balance to you? And "nature" (whatever that means) is NOT a closed system, either here on earth (we rely on the Sun, the sun is not infinite), or in the universal sense (the universe it going to undergo heat death or a big crunch eventually. Thats not balance).
TL;DR You are wrong about all the things.

I didn't start the rumor, that was the trollbox guys on btc-e. I'm just spreading it. And given the rise in nvc on btc-e over the last few days, I'm ready to believe. Besides, even if it as a rumor, the rumor will cause market movements. Thats how this works. Unregulated market, right?

Uh...what? We are talking about food that doesnt grow unless you pay. How can this not be something to complain about? 
Terminator seeds have been shown to be able to "infect" natural seeds with the terminator gene when they cross breed. So, left unchecked, terminator seeds could do insane accidental damage to agriculture, OR enable the creation of a very purposeful "Resource Control Authoritarianism".
So...I'm complaining.

Oh no, don't get me wrong I wasn't saying you should break the  confidence you were trusted with, I was simply pointing out that in financial markets, ESPECIALLY unregulated ones, rumors constitute a large chunk of trading motivation and therefor market liquidity (i think I'm using that term right). So you shouldn't dismiss something just because its a rumor thousands of peeps could be trading on that rumor.

Wow thanks man! Im just getting into it as we speak basicly. I am in the process of partitioning my hard drive so i can save my data while i do a clean windows install on my machine. Ive tried for days to upgrade my gpu drivers so i can start mining but something is messed up at a deeper level than i have the skill to fix so a clean OS install is the next step. Its been pretty cool though ive learned an incredible amount about my comp and bitcoins in the last 48 hours and its hard not to get giddy with excitement over it.
Tl;dr soooon! I hope.

well...i understand that the ASICs have sort of changed the game, but let me put it this way: My electric bill is included in my rent, I steal my neighbor's WiFi, and I literally dont have enough money to afford bread.
So a computer program that "mines" money sounds pretty good to my poor ass. Im not looking to make a million right away. Rent money would be nice. I can still make a few bucks mining even though everyone has superprocessors right?
EDIT thanks for the tip!
