Hashrate is going to BCH because it is more profitable to mine. The difficulty of BCH is going to get adjusted in 6 hours then BTC will get faster again.

I don't know if this friend is familiar with bitcoin. If he isn't then this might not be a good idea. He might lose the coins ending up you smashing your head against a wall.

Because these are big decisions, once you commit to such a change there is no turning back. This is why people see block increases as a last resort.
Segwit is opt-in and disabled by default it will take months for Segwit to be really utilized. LN will probably take even longer. Only when Segwit is used to a high extend and the effects of LN are known another change should be made. I know it is frustrating that it all takes so long but being conservative with these changes is really important.

Now what do you do with the bitcoin? Do you keep it in BTC or directly convert it to euro's?

They used the 2004 - present chard of google trends. It matches.

You can see it happen sometimes on Bitfinex. Someone put up a buy order of over 1000btc then the bots go crazy and start buying aswell. Now when this happens the person who put up the buy order doesn't actually have to buy any as the price jumps. 
This really scares me as it creates artificial jumps in price without any real good reason
Edit: If you look at yesterday 12:00 GTM+2 you can see a spike that I believe is causes by a spoofer. A sudden rise in volume without reason.

What is your point? That double the block size lowers the fees? Because of course that is true but also not the reason this sub is against bigger blocks. 
@_date: 2017-08-11 18:56:13
My advice would be to setup a portfolio and also invest in some other coins.
@_date: 2017-08-24 19:55:00
There is no new chain, only the transactions are different but also fully backwards compatible. Meaning that if you want to send bitcoin you can now do that with a Segwit transaction.
@_date: 2017-08-28 14:19:37
Really cool stuff!
@_date: 2017-08-31 12:50:57
Yes the reward miners get is halved every now and then based on the algorithm. This means that when we approach the 21 million limit the fees will make a bigger and bigger percentage of the miner reward. So in the end the fees are all the miners get and this is a gradual process. 
tldr; % fees per block will increase gradually over time.
@_date: 2017-08-05 19:17:01
You can lookup the transaction on the blockchain, if it is there then all is good. Did you try to restart mycelium?

I really like bitcoin but honestly... I don't see Bitcoin becoming as relevant as fiat while keeping it decentralized. LN or bigger blocks it doesn't matter. Bitcoin is simply not designed for thousands of tx per second. Keep in mind that this is my opinion based on the current upgrade paths, both paths are not sufficient. Other option in the future might significantly change this. 


Currently less that 1% of the transactions in a block are Segwit so you can't judge its performance yet. We have to wait for wallets to update and exchanges to actually use it first.
@_date: 2017-08-25 07:39:37
But how would a goverment get that bitcoin? In the current system the goverment has control over fiat money and can make more if it needs that money.
@_date: 2017-08-16 08:11:34
Right now using it as a currency in stores is very hard. The network is much slower as it was in 2012 when stores did started to use it. So hopefully after segwit and lightning are used it will become interesting again.
@_date: 2017-08-06 13:20:22
At the same time if you only ever invest what you can lose, you wont be making much money. Its a balance between risk and reward.
@_date: 2017-08-26 07:48:04
Bitcoinwisdom isn't being updated anymore and hasn't been for a long time.
@_date: 2017-08-07 16:44:37
The idea of renting mining power is stupid but besides that... this is a classic ponzi scheme.
@_date: 2017-08-21 14:23:43
Totally agree, I see Bitcoin more as digital gold. I like to believe that Segwit and LN will solve the tx/s but realistically... they wont scale bitcoin a 1000x which is what we need for global use. Other coins like IOTA are much more suitable.  
@_date: 2017-08-08 14:37:57
The 'Spoofy' you are referring to can trick people and bots on an Exchange into thinking that some big investor is going to buy a lot of bitcoin. This has the consequence that people start buying as they expect the price to rise. The effect it has is small and the big uptrend bitcoin has right now is not because of spooking. 
@_date: 2017-08-07 18:22:23
Rather than waiting for months and feeling sorry when it hits 5k just invest a fixed amount very week or so. If you don't like it then no problem you get out and all is good. 
@_date: 2018-03-23 08:21:23
However, they also concluded that Bitcoin does not classify as money.

Look at history, it happens every time when a big crash happens.

The fundamental problem that bitcoin is solving is the Bayesian general problem. It is a consensus algorithm. Think about it, somehow thousands of computer all over the world are able to agree of what state the network is on. That is the problem bitcoin solved and it just so happened that a world wide ledger needs that solution. It is by no means perfect and it is being improved by time, lightning network for example. 
But at it's core it is a consensus algorithm.

Simply switch to the winning team and short bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-03-12 21:20:51
I can see it slowly drop to 2.5k in the next 12 months. You can buy but just keep in mind that it can be a very long time before you can get out without a loss.

Spoofing is a big problem causing volatility.

Unfortunately a bubble has nothing to do with how 'good' bitcoin is. If people don't want it anymore because of fear of decrease of value then they sell. Don't get your hopes up we have seen this in the past, winter is coming... many months will be red but next time it will come back even bigger as usual.
@_date: 2018-02-25 20:37:46
That's a good point. Makes me realize that with lighting network it will become even harder to estimate how may people are using Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-03-07 07:28:04
If someone really knew the market then that person would never share that information.

Haha wtf North Korea uses Bitcoin therefore users of Bitcoin are supporting North Korea. Now that's a solid argument. /s
@_date: 2018-03-11 08:40:24
This is exactly my sentiment maybe 2 years down just like from 2013 and slowly up again.

So what about BlueWallet?
