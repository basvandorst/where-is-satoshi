For all practical purposes it is money. I guess you could try to argue this against a law that was being proposed but I doubt it would hold up.

One thing I never understood is how can you verify the signature on something that someone signed without their public key?

@_date: 2015-06-20 14:06:54
That's a great idea and would be really easy to develop. The software could just gather all the mem pool transaction fees and suggest you use a fee that is one standard deviation above the mean. You'd pretty much be guaranteed a spot in the next block or two.
Bitcoin core has a variable transaction size based on recent transactions on the network but I don't know what formula they use. Also the lite wallets like mycelium need this as well.

The coins would be pegged to each other so wouldn't they be the same value? If 1 bitcoin on mainnet is worth $10K and on sidenet it's $12K, then I could just immediately convert my mainnet coins to sidenet coins. Then sell sidenet coins for dollars to buy more mainnet coins and so on and so on.
If both were listed on the same exchange it seems the fact that there could be nearly instantaneous arbitrage would keep the prices pegged too.
I might have misunderstood your statement though.

I think this should be done but I think the timing may be wrong. Greece potentially going into default, Dope being released. A lot of people are going to look into something that they've never heard of before and when they try and get some their transaction may be backed up for hours. It would probably drive most of them away.

Why do they say they need this?
@_date: 2015-06-14 01:28:45
Ahh yes, that all depends on the protocol for the sidechain. I'm pretty sure you could have any parameters on a side chain, which would be just as public and viewable as regular bitcoin. I bet there will be some that are just like the mainnet but others that  have many privacy features like dash or monero have, not to mention different block sizes, block times, and even different mining algorithms if they wanted.
My understanding is that sidechains are just altcoins that are pegged to bitcoin, so you can change any variable you want.

Two questions about the pay wall. What percentage of it goes to the creator of the video and what percentage does the website keep? 
Also I'd imagine a lot of people are paying for this because it's the first time seeing one but I expect it to not be as popular in the future.

I was just about to post this. The whole point of a bank is to lend your money and make interest on those loans in exchange for giving you a portion of the revenue and securing your money. 
If there was no fractional reserve banking then having your money in a bank would be no different from keeping it in a safety deposit box and the bank would make no money.

I'm glad that crypto devs are getting some investment money, though I think it would have been better spent on a more prominent altcoin. Someone could exchange 15 bitcoin for digibyte and drive the price down to 1 satoshi on cryptsy.

@_date: 2014-12-16 02:10:18
Just because they do basically the same thing doesn't mean they don't have a purpose. All crypto coins are currency. Yes, they have less users but they still have real world value. Would you rather have .1 BTC or 1M Doge?
Besides, Dogecoin is different from Bitcoin and Litecoin because it is inflationary rather than deflationary. This will probably have a profound effect on the way each coin is used in the future when cryptos become more mainstream.

From what I could tell they refund the bitcoin equivalent of the dollar cost with the exchange rate calculated at the time of the refund. 
This sounds good compared to refunding the original bitcoin amount. Bitcoin would get a bad rap with companies if users were changing their minds and getting refunds when bitcoin went up in price after they already paid.

Many college students aren't going to know anything about bitcoin or care enough to go through the labour of setting up online accounts.

Yeah, and according to a post on there are two other ones that are also seized by the FBI now. I wonder if the one guy controlled all three of them. 
Also he wasn't being that secure when accessing and using SR2. According to P. 23 and 24 from the official complaint  he listed his personal gmail account (of which he accessed from his home IP address) with the server provider. When the FBI took the server offline to image it, the server provider sent emails to the gmail address saying it was down. He also wasn't using TOR and instead accesing the site through google chrome on an old mac.
Still no mention about how they found the server originally though, unless I missed that somewhere. You'd think people in these positions would be a lot more cautious though. if I ran one of these I would take every measure necessary to make sure that it couldn't be traced back to me at all.

Sorry, bad wording. For half the customers show an increased cost for paypal like the [picture]( you have. For the other half show a discount for bitcoin like [this]( and no increase in the other ones. You will charge the same in both cases.
You then see what percentage of users will buy the product and what method of payment used based on which case they get. I'm guessing you'll get more sales from the second one because people don't want to feel like they're being charged more.

How would they be traded between each other? The private keys and transactions for one coin would be viable on the other one too. And I'm sure at some point a transaction either would get broadcast on both networks. I could send you 5 BTC in old coins but the transaction would get on both networks so then I sent you 5 BTC in new coins as well.
Also if I traded 5million dogecoin for bitcoin, then withdrew it, I would get it in my old and new wallets.

Theoretically miners could refuse to process any transactions dealing with those addresses that have te stolen funds. However this would introduce a great deal of central authority to the network.

lol wut. You know August 1st was the fork date. The opening price then was right around $360. It didn't get to $800 until the 19th. It's more than doubled since launch. 
Because of the EDA, BCH blocks are produced on average faster than BTC blocks. Right now the cash chain is a little over 1500 blocks ahead of the core chain. So Bitcoin Core has been more profitable to mine on average, but not as much as the 3x amount you got just from comparing price. You also need to take into account that there are more BCH created in the same amount of time. 
@_date: 2017-08-28 00:04:28

A bitcoin wallet doesn't have to be physical. Bitcoin is just a computer program that is linked to other peoples' programs. There are many types of wallets such as web wallets (like coinbase and circle), software wallets (bitcoin core and electrum), and hardware wallets (trezor and ledger). 
Web wallets are hosted by someone else and are the least secure. Software wallets run on your computer and are very secure. Hardware wallets run on a usb drive and send commands through USB, these are the most secure. I'd recommend  [electrum]( It's fairly easy and straightforeward to use. You shouldn't have to worry about hardware wallets unless you're storing tens of thousands of dollars worth of coins.
In addition to web wallets, coinbase and circle are exchanges. you can connect a bank account or credit/debit card to buy bitcoin from them. They have no effect on what wallet you use.


When using electrum it gives you a 12 word phrase on initial set up. Write down this phrase and you'll be able to completely recover your wallet in case of computer failure.


With bitcoin you are in complete control of your funds and only you have the power to move your money. Sending a bitcoin transaction will cost around 2 cents for **any** amount being sent. Not free, but insignificant for most all transactions (credit cards take around 3%, western union around 10%). Exchanging USD for bitcoin will have fees depending on where you buy from, most places have around 1%.


Check your wallet software to see that you received the funds. It is impossible to counterfeit bitcoins because the blockchain is basically a huge ledger that everyone on the network shares. Nobody can release a transaction that makes coins out of thin air because the network won't accept it.


Unfortunately for a business they have to comply with stuff like this or be shut down. If you don't want to go through all that you could use [localbitcoins]( to buy from a person and not a business.

Yeah, I just checked the rest and it seems that wikileaks and voat are the only ones that are owned by other people. The rest of them only had transactions from this attack and turned up no search results. 
Also I say "attack" because the wallets associated with these addresses will probably be unusable as it's happened before where the wallet software will crash if it has to handle thousands of transactions like this.
@_date: 2015-07-08 05:01:13
Someone was (maybe still is, I haven't checked recently) sending tens of thousands of tiny transactions. The network can't process the transactions at the rate that they're coming in so it's creating a huge backlog. The spam transactions are paying above the normal fee and so they're being included in blocks while other peoples' transactions aren't being confirmed for hours on end.
UTXO stands for unspent transaction output. Anytime you receive a bitcoin transaction that creates an unspent output, and also gets rid of one because someone else just spent theirs to send to you. It's possible to create custom transactions that have one or two inputs and hundreds of outputs so the net UTXOs from the transaction is really high. The problem with a lot of UTXOs is that they have to be stored on RAM and RAM is a lot more expensive than a regular hard disk. 
OP created [litecoin]( and is discussing the way they implemented a method to prevent mass spamming of transactions like this.

I know my stuff. 93% pfff. 
On question 6 you shouldn't use verify and confirm interchangeably. All nodes verify a transaction (for a valid signature, that the addresses have those funds, it's not a double spend... etc) before relaying it to other peers. Verifying is based on cryptographic proofs.
A confirmation is for each block after, and including, the one that the transaction was included in. It has nothing guaranteed in the software but is merely a metric for the user to determine how likely it is that the coins will not be double spent.
@_date: 2015-08-09 14:37:15

I think you could also add the option to send the recipient a link to the encrypted key. You could store the key on your server because it's only 64 bytes. When they open the link they could either export the encrypted key or enter the password and decrypt it all in browser to send to another address. Once complete they could also check a button so you can erase it from the server memory.
It would be a lot easier to use, especially on mobile, because they wouldn't have to deal with downloading and uploading a file.

I wish he would have mentioned that you can buy any amount of bitcoin because it's highly divisible. The article makes it sound like this is the lowest denomination.

Did you fix the problem with firefox on Ubuntu where the video wouldn't stream or download after it was unlocked?

What surprises me most is that that guy in the comments begging for donations actually has had 127 bitcoins flow through his address in the past year.

A bank will still accept it because the serial number is intact. Foiled again!

Hope much of this did you know about before getting into bitcoin? People don't need to know how money works, they just need to know how to use it.
@_date: 2015-07-22 19:29:55
Call or text them. You could also use PGP if they and you have a public key and you don't know them personally.

It's actually right on their website.
@_date: 2015-07-24 22:14:37
Only the web version is free, if they use the api then they have to pay the transaction fee themselves. And if the attacker is paying the fee how is it any different from spamming normally like what happened a week ago?

Tried them on Tor and bitcoin was either the third or fourth for each site (excapt ask.com because that didn't give me any suggestions).

I hope they're all there for set up and your not going to keep all of them in the same building. Your not going to see much business so the machines should be spread out at different parts of the city.

Mycelium will give you a new receiving address each time. If you used an old one then it is still on the phone and you still have your coins. As for why it's not showing up that is propably an issue with Mycelium's servers.
@_date: 2015-07-11 15:11:49
So with fold I can get a refund in bitcoin of whatever I didn't spend!? The reason I never used it was because I thought it would be really annoying to have a bunch of low balance cards on my account. This changes everything, gotta try it out.

Either have her use Circle/Coinbase or just use Electrum and write down the 12 word seed (you store one too). Then every time you have to reinstall windows just regenerate the wallet. Even if she forgets the password (if she uses one) she can still regenerate the wallet from the seed.
@_date: 2015-07-08 01:58:48
The password for the other one was "password".  I'm guessing the rest if the addresses used in the spam transactions are also something easy like this.
@_date: 2015-07-12 23:46:58
I highly doubt you actually sent him 1 bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-07-08 04:47:37
When you withdraw from a tipbot it isn't sent from a bunch of small inputs of the same values that you were tipped. It just takes the total of your account and sends that from one address. Unless your trying to withdraw pennies it wouldn't cost much of anything. Just save up tips until you have a few dollars.
@_date: 2015-07-15 15:37:42
How can it be excellent health care coverage if the inhaler costs $300? In what world does something "excellent" force you to pay 10x as much as the same thing somewhere else?
@_date: 2015-07-12 05:17:09
But they could still accept other people's blocks that are 20mb and have their own blocks stay at .7. Just like how now a miner can create a zero transaction block and still accept blocks that are 1mb.
They can mine on whatever the main chain is and create blocks as small or as large as they want.
@_date: 2015-07-07 18:01:38
It's been shown that you can use a microphone (even one as low a quality as a smartphone) to extract the decryption key from a running computer. 
There are also ways to do this by analysing the electromagnetic field given off by a running CPU. 
I don't know how effective this would be against the encryption bitcoin uses though.
@_date: 2015-07-07 04:31:11
it seems the average unconfirmed transaction age is 3 and a half hours.

Why method are you currently using that you can't buy more than €1000?
@_date: 2015-07-08 04:49:34
The filter option is optional. It's up to the miners to prevent spam transactions themselves. The rules are just a standard that everyone agrees on, same with bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-07-15 02:25:37


This is probably so they can silently charge you for stuff like taking drinks from the minifridge or ordering room service. Impulsive things people wouldn't want to do if they had to pay for it each time.
@_date: 2015-07-07 13:13:26
If that's the reason then they should have sent to the dev address rather than voat and wikileaks which have nothing to do with it.
@_date: 2015-07-15 15:33:10
So free as in stealing money from someone else to pay for your health care?
@_date: 2015-07-22 02:21:09
So will they rebroadcast old transactions that haven't been included in blocks yet?

Why couldn't Satoshi just bought the .com domain at the same time he got the .org one and had them go to the same place? Would have solved a lot of problems.

With incognito mode they can still track you and customize search results specifically to you by tracking your IP address. Incognito just prevents your browser from using any of the previous cookies or storing history but you can sure bet that google still is keeping this information on their servers.

Why right now as opposed to any other time? 
@_date: 2017-09-05 13:01:40


I'm not sure what you're not getting. The larger a block is the longer it takes to propagate the network and be verified by a majority of miners. The longer it takes to propagate the bigger the chance that it'll be orphaned. 
Miners want to minimize the risk of being orphaned while maximizing profit from fees. If they feel that the profit from including the low fee transactions doesn't outweigh the risk of being orphaned then they won't include the ones with low fees. 
@_date: 2015-04-19 16:09:26
This is so cool! I downloaded the app and completed the first three missions. I'm just waiting for the clue now. The augmented really is really cool. I had no idea that could be done realtime on a phone and be interactive!

It's only 5% for one year, then it will be decreasing year after year. It's a static 5 billion coins that are created each year. Also the inflation rate will be very close to bitcoin, and below litecoin, for the next few years.

This may be because I did something wrong when copying the text to a text file and naming it diceware.89z. The code link should really start a download rather than link to a page of text. Anyone got a way to fix this?

What website was it?
@_date: 2015-10-20 16:36:56
Try importing the private key to another wallet client then. The other wallet you use probably won't see the first transaction because it's not in peoples' memory pool anymore. You won't have to clear anything and no risk on losing your coins.
Edit: Is [this]( the transactions you made? If so it seems to have been confirmed by now.
@_date: 2015-03-02 21:49:37
Thanks, also I like how they always cut off the graph at the peak price in 2013. You can always tell what message the author is trying to get across.

What happens if you try to send another transaction? That happened to me and mycelium allowed me to send another transaction with the same imput.
@_date: 2015-03-10 14:17:22
Their code is all open source and you can compile your own client to use on your computer. Their "company" consists of 4 people in Germany, so the American government would have no authority there. By that logic why doesn't the government force bitcoin developers to change the code so it sends all bitcoins to burner addresses and destroys the network?
@_date: 2015-03-26 15:58:28
This is ugly and tacky. If someone is doing those they need to make it look more professional. Check out some of the Where's George bills. Get a small stamp and put it in the empty space on the bill.

I second circle. Use their mobile app to set up and pay with a credit/debit card. I did it and bought $10 worth of bitcoins in 10 minutes.
@_date: 2015-03-03 00:04:42
Circle's exchange rate is already higher than the market price. Their fee is hidden in a ~1% increase compared to the market so the customers will never be buying at a discount this way.

I've been using Tutanota for a while and love it. Their android app works really well and they continue to make their service better and roll out new features. 20mBTC just sent their way.

Maybe because on the dark wallet website it says:


Also they are only for chrome and I use firefox. Plus I'd like to see it as a stand alone application rather than a browser add-on.

I set up circle with my debit card on my phone and bought some coins in 10 minutes. Had to take a picture of my ID and my face. Was all super easy and fast. 
I'll admit the app design sucks balls, I could make a fortune being a design consultant for them. It's not very intuitive and they don't give much information. I don't keep any coins on there though, I move all bitcoin to my mycelium wallet as soon as I buy some.
Also I'm having trouble connecting a bank account (though I may have given the wrong routing number).
@_date: 2015-02-14 07:41:37
Just wondering, do you do this for any value over 1 BTC? That seems like a lot of work. How much do you keep in a hot wallet?

All encryption in tutanota is browser based and then you just send them the encrypted data to be sent or stored. They never have access to your password and can't decrypt your emails.
