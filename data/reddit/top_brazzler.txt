Please remember [that the IRS]( wastes tax money horribly. 
Always pay the absolute minimum you can legally get away with.

Is this a widely accepted fact? Or just your personal opinion?

I am asking because I don't believe in your statement. Value is based on supply and demand and simply its status of being "on top" (in terms of market cap) is what I believe makes BTC more valuable (as opposed to your "oldest theory")

Hi and thank you for the very informative reply. The bitcoin reddit is where a lot of new people learn and discover bitcoin and a nice, friendly community certainly helps new users more interested in joining. 
Can I ask you why it doesn't bother you that this subreddit deletes a lot of information and forbids discussion that the mods don't agree with? Roger Ver points this out a lot, and I'm curious as to why that doesn't take away a little bit of the trustworthiness of this subreddit as a whole? (I am subbed to this subreddit as well as r/btc)

Yeah I regret seeing it. Be glad you didn't watch. Makes me think everyone on reddit is a bunch of sick fucks.
