well, I have no interest in or out (other than my small wagers...) Thing is,  my bets were made 34h ago and, unless there's a HUGE delay, they're just taking money and hidding away. I sent 2 emails to support and no answer as of now (about 30h later)
@_date: 2014-02-25 15:36:25
Is this real?
@_date: 2014-08-17 20:16:25
I really don't understand what you guys mean.... If I sign a message, what text do you want me to include on the signature?
@_date: 2014-08-17 21:55:14
I guess you are a very lonely person... I am sorry... I also presume you either have never built anything ground up or you have always had everything handed to you by your daddy... See, your opposition to my posts - discrediting me and so on, calling me a beggar though I am trying to make something beautiful and relevant - basically speaks about yourself... not a very nice picture... but hey, I know the number one rule about trolls: do not engage. So here it stops.
@_date: 2014-02-20 11:42:40
But, being as they are the oldest biggest exchange, I'd be hard pressed to believe they are not solvent...
@_date: 2014-08-17 19:02:27
I have googled this and apparently I am not the only one... damn me for not checking before betting....
@_date: 2014-08-17 22:00:15
I m so sorry... I have a TON of addresses (aparently I created a new one every transaction) From my transaction info, how can I get my sending address?  Thanks so much in advance, I am learning a lot!

@_date: 2014-08-17 18:41:39
let me know what do you need as proof. I am telling you, I have tried to play and the bitcoins never came back. Maybe it's just a 24h delay? (if that sounds plausible) I don't accuse wildly....
@_date: 2014-02-24 13:52:22

aside from this, where am I supposed to look for this?
@_date: 2014-02-20 13:37:56
I agree they might not be the most competent of the bitfolks out there, but I am pretty confident they are not flat out thieves. See, they have MUCH more to profit from fixing the issue than from this short term specullations everyone is pointing out. I don't think they are THAT stupid as to believe that take the money and run would be more profitable than maintaining a propper exchange -specially considering their position in the bitcoin comunity in terms of volume.

thanks! we are trying to build some kind of foreign funding system for investors. I will check your suggestions.
@_date: 2014-08-17 21:04:25
Since I am getting a lot of antagonism I want to clear out this: I HOPE TO BE PROVEN WRONG AND GET MY BTCs BACK!!! I have no interest other than this. So far I have not received any answer from satoshidice and transactions are all confirmed....
@_date: 2014-02-20 13:33:36
Precisely my point. I have been with them for over a year and a half and, everytime, they have resolved and covered...
@_date: 2014-02-21 16:48:41
That's not true. Fiat goes in and out (I've done it myself) only BTCs are pending on the way out.
@_date: 2014-08-17 20:51:39
I know what the blockchain is, I am just asking what do they need to believe me! My single point is: people might get scammed by satoshidice. I always loved that site, but it is not the same anymore. I have read that it changed hands. I don't know what the new owners are doing, but from where I stand, they're taking money and hiding away. And I would LOVE to be proven wrong and get my BTC back....what's with the animosity? geez....
@_date: 2014-08-17 21:23:52
ok, I get it, it's like becoming public in share market....but more distributed.. I love the idea!! I need to do a lot of research now!
@_date: 2014-08-17 18:44:21
let me know what you consider a proof or GTFO... I don't accuse wildly
@_date: 2014-02-20 12:29:37
The only part not working is BTC out. I have deposit and withdrawn fiat in Eur with no problem whatsoever. I do know that there's a big market in panic, but please, let's be reasonable. MtGox is more than solven and they will resume operations when they can. Then all the BTC shopping at ridiculous prices will pay off...
@_date: 2014-08-18 17:21:56
well, news are one of the transactions came through. I didn't loose my own money, but my suspicions are founded -though hopefully will be wrong and everything will be sent back... maybe because I made so much noise.. Whichever way, I don't think it's negative that I shout out trouble with a gambling site, I WILL APOLOGIZE IF I AM WRONG!
@_date: 2014-08-17 20:25:22
trolling! not deserving an answer....
@_date: 2014-02-20 12:03:11
they went through for me...
@_date: 2014-08-17 21:08:40
sorry for my ignorance... I signed a message with all the transaction details. Then someone said it's not that, so I signed another message with the text "tostadero / satoshidice" ...I really don't see many more options to do this in my client (qt) You want me to sign a message -I can do that- with a text -explain exactly which text- and post it.... I can do that. Sorry for the inconvenience....
@_date: 2014-08-17 20:33:50
besides, how can you agree with a guy that, without knowing me or my business calls me a criminal???
@_date: 2014-08-18 17:05:44
one of the transactions DID come through about 48 h later... but the emails have never been answered.... Thanks for the info and the patience....
@_date: 2014-08-18 17:03:31
well, see, masturbation tends to be a lonely endeavour.... let's close this here because you're really not giving much....
@_date: 2014-02-20 12:02:34
i did the same 3 days ago, so far, buying bitcoins ridiculously cheap. My trust in Gox remains unharmed...
@_date: 2014-02-20 13:34:48
I agree, I think much of this is just the market going hysterical. I have been into this for long enough to know there's a lot of bullshit, but MtGox have shown again and again they are reliable in the long run...
@_date: 2014-08-17 20:39:24
yet, emails from satoshidice have not been responded and my bitcoins are missing... So, like it or not, enjoy your little turf, still the problem is there, and some other people might suffer it...
@_date: 2014-08-17 20:21:29
well, I have learned that you can get investors from the most unsuspecting places. See I managed to secure 130k€ this way so far. I would say that's not too bad for a business that hasn't even started, is it? Did you ever build a business of your own? did you ever secure real money for a business just because of your excellence? are you actually in position to invest something? Otherwise, I'm not really interested in you "not being interested"... you could just not post.
@_date: 2014-08-17 20:37:06
thank's , I appreciate it!  I am not too tech savvy.... so I have to write my reddit name on the text message of my bitcoin client and sign it?
@_date: 2014-08-17 20:59:13
how the crap do you think you get capital? from your daddy? capital for real business usualy comes from strangers... dimwit...
@_date: 2014-08-17 20:31:50
so talking about a real business on the bitcoin comunity is begging? Trying to push a culturally relevant business on one of the spearheads of the bitcoin movement -music- is begging? WTF are you guys talking about? I am not begging... I am offering a possibility for business and, so far, I see no problem with that in reddit/bitcoin ... if my post is off topic, let me know, otherwise GTFO....
@_date: 2014-02-22 18:09:54
and it seems transactions are going through. Still just rumors, but it seems MtGox will be good for it... I didn't expect less...
@_date: 2014-08-17 19:53:01
this? a signed message from my client? HxIPqLp0qwT79S39/iLL+KY5qWfLBBSzeMmMk5dnTrKTUqb9UYNLdaFawn6zlEaryBS3d2yeI7kLXhnSUIwfJec=

@_date: 2014-08-17 21:56:43
or maybe you're with the satoshidice people and want to make sure I pay for lifting the veil on the scam?
@_date: 2014-08-17 19:12:26
what do you mean? you can tell my reddit user from my posts, can't you? and transaction ID is there....

@_date: 2014-08-18 21:29:23
@_date: 2014-02-20 16:17:43
the reason why that happened in my opinion is very clear: security issues in one hand (mind Japan is nou the US or Europe, a protest at your door is a VERY serious issue) and probably a matter of costs in the other. I doubt this is a take the oney and run situation. That conclusion actually leaves out a lot of facts.
@_date: 2014-08-17 22:28:17
Unfortunately, I am a poor man!
@_date: 2014-02-21 17:30:19
completely agree with you on the risk. I retrieve the downvote. I'm just against the extreme infos being broadcasted here. Let's be rigurous. MtGox are in a pickle, yes, but they've also been there before and always came out well -maybe not as good as desired, but definetly not as thieves...

@_date: 2013-04-19 12:41:33
Not really. It's broadly understood that security is usually improved by open source. Also, I believe that the 1st problem with Bitcoin today is the lack of exchanges and the excessive power centralized in MtGox (they admit so as well) 
More exchanges means more stability.Granted some of them will fail or not even lift flight, but that's whjat it takes in order to have a few really good ones succeding...
@_date: 2013-04-29 09:40:08
I don't know... It's been 3 days with no answer to the tickets, no email, and no Bitcoins! I have to imagine there were a lot of transactions to be made manually, but I'm frankly loosing my trust in bitcoin-central... and I will have gone from top supporter to "never-use-again"  I have to say that the lack of information in this situation is very bad for bitcoin-central... I mean, how many customers did they have? 2.000? 20.000? I don't see many posts complaining about them, so I have to presume there were not that many customers....
@_date: 2013-04-30 16:13:17
but does it show as sent or as transaction done in the balance? I mean, my balance at bitcoin-central shows as 0 BTC....
@_date: 2013-04-24 12:48:42
It's not reallistic to expect Bitcoin's volatility to reduce in any near future. Even though there's much of a currency in bitcoin, bitcoin must still be considered an asset/share. In a situation of rapid growth of an enterprise (as bitcoin could be considered) it is to be expected to have high volatility. Also, it's healthy for bitcoin to have speculators. If bitcoin can't handle speculators, then it will never succeed... All in all what we have to hope for is more exchanges, more bussinesses accepting bitcoin, and a stronger infrastructure capable of dealing with DDOS and pirate attacks. I must say, I own bitcoins, and I have a recording studio where I accept them. Also, I have become a strong defender since my first transaction...
@_date: 2013-09-04 22:12:12
oh, sorry, didn't get the point until I followed the link of the previous poster. I agree, completely irrelevant...
@_date: 2013-05-07 19:12:34

well it's an ancient device used to make cool reflective lamps and cupholders... not of much interest to the MP3 generation...
@_date: 2013-09-04 22:10:54
well, I think having an account of somebody that is on a problematic situation with the biggest exchange so far would be somewhat usefull....  
@_date: 2013-04-24 20:15:34
they're usually quite open and fast in their response. I hope they can manage to make their security tighter...
@_date: 2013-04-27 19:26:09
I have given orders to transfer my bitcoins about a day and a half ago (as soon as they opened the service again) and have not received them yet. They don't seem to answer the tickets either. I have huge trust in them and I really like their transparency and service, but I think they're way over their heads doing each transaction manually... otherwise, why would it take more than 40h? I have to say I am more than a bit concerned...
@_date: 2013-11-07 09:42:56
Since this post we have found yet another vulnerability in Betcoincircle -notified them properly... Some more bitcoins disapeared... some apologies, some bitcoins came back, some more from different addresses have now dissappeared -again.... Well, I have the utmost simpathy for the webmaster that is dealing with this and probably doing his best -though it's not enough.... Whichever way, me and cryptoBCN do recomend NOT to put your bitcoins into betcoincircle.... they might get lost in the worst of cases, they will be stolen by a NON random game that profiles and plays with cyclic and predictable results to empty your pockets. We have done over 5.000 spins and all our predictions stand true. Some behavieours take money, some of them give -which should never happen in a propperly random rulette system....
@_date: 2013-11-11 18:36:55
I think it depends very much on what your goals are. My position is, buy bitcoin when it's low, and keep buying it. I am bullish in bitcoin because I know it will work... I am the first bussiness in Spain to implement it and everything arround me is saying: please give us an alternate currency, we don't trust this f*ckers anymore with the whole euro and so on.... Once Bitcoin gains a little traction in Spain it will be similar to what's happening in China -but smaller. Anyways, answering your question, do you want to make money fast -but risk a lot- or make money little by little and risk less?
@_date: 2013-04-25 20:43:13
Yes, somwhere at bitcointalk I read about it. Apparently they managed to track about half of what was stolen (which aparently was not much) and that they are going to fully cover the rest. (what's with the guy at the bottom? a fuse blew up?)
@_date: 2013-09-04 20:37:15
I will try that and get back to you'all....
@_date: 2013-04-25 20:44:26
@_date: 2013-09-04 22:12:49

@_date: 2013-09-18 09:44:47
well, I had worked with them for months and I thought they were still the safest. I guess not.
@_date: 2013-04-17 15:34:36
Having had my recording studio advertised this morning, and feeling the post also includes me, I must speak up as a bitcoin user as well: I think it's VERY important that companies with a strong comitment with bitcoin have a way to solidify their bussiness in bitcoins... It's all about comunity, and this is one way. Of course I would never advocate for indiscriminated spam and in a near future -hopefully- there will be so many of us that this will not be the appropriate place for this kind of marketing, but, so far, I think it's good both for comerce and the bitcoin comunity.
@_date: 2013-04-29 19:18:17
Has somebody actually received their BTC or their EUR back from bitcoin-central? Nobody at bitcointalk has, neither do I see anybody here....  Somebody?
@_date: 2013-11-08 01:55:46
some more news.... Clear problems in betcoincircle's coding- but their answer now is: go on publish it, great publicity for us! They profile users and manipulate outcomes, don't give in. We posted this to warn you, not to encourage you to spend your money there!
@_date: 2013-09-18 09:43:43
MtGox is gone. Do NOT trust them!! I definetly had 7000€ in their accounts and they say the transfer never got to them!! They are clearly taking funds from customers!
@_date: 2013-11-23 14:25:50
betcoin is on scavenger mode,,, taking everything... far from probably fair... he should be in jail.
@_date: 2013-04-17 08:14:58
there is, just not so implemented: at our labels we accept bitcoins to buy the artist's CDs and merchandise.
That would be  We also accept bitcoins to record albums and compose music!
@_date: 2013-09-18 09:42:45
Just as a follow up. 1 month after asking for my money back or for the money to be present in my account, Mt Gox denies that the money is there and my bank assures me that the money was sent. So MtGox is gone, no more trust whatsoever....
@_date: 2013-04-25 12:28:51
bit of trolling here, have we?
