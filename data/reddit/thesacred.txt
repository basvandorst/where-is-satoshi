As of today one of the major stations in Tokyo (Roppongi station) has a giant three-storey billboard right dead center as you come up/down the main escalator advertising a bitcoin app for iphone. I think it's official. We are no longer early adopters.

That's way too high considering the level of usefulness bitcoin currently holds. (It's still extremely hard and impractical to use for anything but speculation and HODLing)
@_date: 2017-12-04 20:14:48
You can't really go shopping with bitcoin, but many of the large real estate companies in Tokyo now let you pay your rent with bitcoin. So it's something.

I used my bitcoins to buy games (humble bundle and humble store) and shop for niche things at stores that accept them (e.g., knives4bitcoin.com, if it's still around). I did that from 2012 to 2016. Now I have none :(

I've lived in Tokyo for over a decade and while it's good in some ways, just looking around the people here generally seem to be quite unhappy and isolated. Lots of loneliness, depression, suicide, people being worked to death in horrible office environments, crazy people talking to themselves on the train and in the streets, rampant alcoholism. 
Smaller cities like Kyoto and Sapporo, or cities on other islands like Kyuushuu have seemed to me a lot more hospitable.

Early on (2012-ish) I bought a knife from someone on reddit for around 80 bitcoins. (Never used it)
A while later I bought a humble bundle game for ~6 bitcoins. (Never even installed it)
After that I bet the last of my BTC on a sure thing: Anderson Silva to win against Chris Weidman. (He did not)
Then when I was holding 0 the price took off for the moon and never came back. 
So yeah, I can relate. lol 
@_date: 2017-12-04 20:12:00
Well if by doing it right you mean $50 USD equivalent door charge (or more, quite often), drinks costing $10 USD equivalent each, sticky floors and blown out speakers, and if you leave the venue for any reason you can't get back in again without paying, and the vast majority of the time the DJ is some kid playing a top 40 playlist from youtube and talking over it constantly/trying to sing along. If that's doing it right, then Tokyo clubs definitely do it right.

They're playing bitcoin commercials on regular TV in Japan now. Regularly. There are bitcoin ads on the trains and giant bitcoin billboards all over the city. People who never heard of bitcoin until a week ago have been all buying. It blew up way too fast, and we all knew it was going to fall again. I hope the price falls a lot more, personally. But even if it does, it's mainstream now, there's no going back.

Karpeles is incompetent. We all knew this. It doesn't mean Gox is folding. They've temporarily disabled withdrawals and fucked up the market. They've done worse things in the past. I see no reason to think this will be the last time. I'm sure they'll still be around fucking things up and going offline every few months well into the future. 
The truth is most of the really rich people, the movers and shakers, the captains of industry are all incompetent fuck-ups like Mark who just happened to be in the right place at the right time, or happened to be born with the right parents. That's just the world we live in.

Actually the biggest buy/sell walls on MtGox seem to mostly happen at JPY amounts, which makes it pretty annoying that bitcoinity still doesn't offer a chart for JPY/BTC.

Once upon a time (not that long ago in fact) people had to be convinced to think of credit cards as money. Now yet another transaction model has come along that people need to learn about. The implication is that one day bitcoins will be as commonplace as a form of money as credit cards are now.

Get real. They are speculating, hoping to cash out for a profit. The fact that bitcoins are actually useful accounts for a tiny, tiny percentage of their current exchange value.

It's not detrimental. It might not be as good as some other content, but that's what upvotes and downvotes are for. Memes, posters, and badly photoshopped graphics are all part of how a group of people develop a "conversation" about a topic like this on the internet. It's a good thing. It produces a lot of rubbish, but it also produces great things like the "Plan B" slogan and some of the better artwork we've seen. You can't get to those points without there being a lot of mediocre posts along the way.

The treble with that view is that by the same reasoning, every atom in your body could be transformed into pure energy at any given moment. It's bound to happen if you wait around long enough, but the odds are so slim that it's almost certain not to happen during the brief period of time that you're alive and your body exists in its current form. So, basically it's not going to happen so it's not worth worrying about.

Through courts, buyouts, and various methods they managed to kill napster, limewire, kazaa, supernova, and every other major piracy hub including almost every major public torrent site except for TPB (which is constantly having to move and change hands to stay alive). They managed to buy legislation that sent people to jail not just for offering pirated goods, but for receiving them. 
Maybe the corporate machine can't kill cryptocurrency in general, but there's every reason to believe they could kill bitcoin.
