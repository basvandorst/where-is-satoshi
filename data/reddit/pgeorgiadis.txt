You keep making assumptions here. Never said that this is how reward should be calculated.
We were talking about efficiency in terms of Hashes/Joule.
So I said that Hashes/Joule is not that useful because our aim is not to calculate hashes, but to make transactions. So a metric that is based on energy spend per transactions value is more useful. Of course any reasonable man would like to minimize that ratio.

Maybe a better metric for the efficiency of a PoW algorithm is joule per total value of transactions. Meaning total energy spent to calculate a block, divided by the total value of the transactions in the block.

Sorry, why would people do that? You make no sense.
I never said that the target should be to maximize that number, why did you make that assumption? I thought it was obvious that the target is to minimize that number...

Whoever made this is not very bright. Certainly doesn't understand what these all mean.
The success of Uber, Facebook, Alibaba and Airbnb is based on a centralized model. The only thing they offer is a centralized way of ordering Taxis, sharing media with your friend, finding products and finding accommodation. They make money out of their reputation without really offering us something we couldn't have if we could agree in open protocols and distributed systems.
The cryptocurrencies that are mineable are distributed ledgers really.
