Not just the average Joe who trusts their governments but the guys who don't and aren't tech savvy and willfully admit it and see crypto coming in the future regardless.

Carefully after about a year of research and planning.

Honestly some humor makes bitcoin much less daunting. Personally I’m not very tech savvy and after getting tired of all the fees from Coinbase I’ve decided to get an actual wallet so trying to research all these wallets then finding there’s ways for the companies themselves to compromise my wallet and trying to keep up with it all combined with the fact that if I screw up somewhere my money could potentially just disappear with no possible recourse makes the whole thing pretty stressful. The juice is worth the squeeze though. In regards to mass adoption it’s not going to happen until fiat completely fails or governments endorse it because the masses only change something like their preference of currency when they’re forced.

If 200 billion is “chump change” as you put it and you think it’ll still go 10x,  why is it such a stretch to think it can hit a trillion? With its ability to be used more and more everyday across the world a trillion globally doesn’t seem insane.

I tried your strategy and just lost money. Your best bet is to just buy it and hold it long term. You’ll gain far more value that way.

That's the attitude that'll gain mass adoption personal attacks and snark.

God are you reading this thread at all? It's been answered at least 2x before you asked in this thread alone!

The are plenty of people smart enough to use it.  Mass adoption comes when those who aren't smart enough to learn can use it without worry. That day has yet to come. The banks are already trying to take it over with exchanges completely making decentralization moot. The macro look at how we got here simply put is ignorance and apathy which is in no short supply today.

Time to go "old school" and start building your own websites again and drive traffic to them.

Never claimed to have a surefire plan but if you dont want to be censored erased whatever you want to call it get off those sites and start your own. There is no such thing as a slam dunk in any business. If there was wed all be doing already.

Until ihsotas introduces tibcoin.

The way I've always understood it you cant deplatform a personal website. They can pull their ads off your site but they cant just shut it down and you can still do ads in your videos just like podcasts do.

That’s usually what a question indicates.

That doesn’t even look like the chic in the videos I’ve seen

Patience is a virtue cultivate bitcoin and it will grow.

I’ve heard the argument that this banking system has levers and tools to work for different situations BUT how sound is your system really if you have to print and pump a quarter TRILLION dollars into it to keep it afloat? Just asking for a friend.
