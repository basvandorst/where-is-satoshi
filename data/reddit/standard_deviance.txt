I'm not exactly sure what your saying. They can't use the fact that coins were tumbled as any sort of proof of criminal activity. The court has to prove first that an criminal activity took place, before they can convict you of any money laundering charges.

Cash has no fees and cheaper than credit card, but outside of a few gas stations/mini marts I have never seen a cash discount. 
Considering it costs 1% to convert via coinbase and you are forsaking 1-3% CC cashback offer and it would have to be a very strong discount to entice most people.

Probably with a warrant and confiscation of the computer engaged in criminal activity.

Yes, the term "proceeds" includes bartering, selling and actually gifting and I don't think anyone is going to argue against the fact that bitcoin has value.
In the memorandum I personally think the strongest argument the defense made was that he was just an operator of the site and not directly involved in the drug deals.
Of course Ross's payment structure of taking a percentage of each transaction makes it harder to prove that.

Actually it's not very good argument. The crime of money laundering includes the laundering assets and property used in a criminal enterprise.

I agree that it could be used to obtain a warrant. As for taxing purposes, the IRS isn't going to trace the blockchain and they don't even need probable cause to issue a review.
@_date: 2014-04-01 22:35:27
No they don't. Money laundering is taking the proceeds of a crime and transforming it into money or other assets (such as property).  [For those that are downvoting read the first line of wikipedia](

Well several members of the pirate have been sentenced time (4-10 months) 
But there are plenty of people who are willing to step up continue to operate pirate bay at the risk of 4-10 months of  jail time in white collar prison.
SR operators are facing life in prison. The pool of people willing to operate a site with those penalties is much much smaller.

If you solely ran a bitcoin node/miner than no as any drug transaction would be misuse of a general service.
If you created an alt-coin exclusively for drug trade that had a high transaction fee than it would be a lot more of a gray area because it's no longer misuse but rather the point of the service.

Not all lawyers do the shotgun approach. Lawyers with rich clients do.

I think thats a great point about deflation. 
The great depression was a  deflationary spiral of about 9% for it's first few years. 
Even if bitcoin can maintain a 7% rate it's going to take about 40 years to hit that 10,000 dollar price point everyone keeps talking about. While 10,000 per bitcoin is a lot I wouldn't consider the moderate holder of 50-100 bitcoins as super rich.

Unfortunately for the lawyer  he completely glossed over this part of the Law
(3) Whoever, with the intent—
(A) to promote the carrying on of specified unlawful activity;
**(B) to conceal or disguise the nature, location, source, ownership, or control of property believed to be the proceeds of specified unlawful activity; or**
(C) to avoid a transaction reporting requirement under State or Federal law,
 Concealing the ownership of property (bitcoins as defined by the government) by use of a tumbler when such property is known to be the proceeds from illegal activity is in fact illegal. 
@_date: 2014-04-02 02:29:14
Money laundering by definition includes property, monetary instruments and other non-money items. 
You can't get out of money laundering by merely using diamonds or gold or being paid in bitcoins. 
A mixing service is fine as long as the bitcoins weren't initially gained by criminal activity.

They are gone. 
Here's what will happen. 
Gox will liquidate it's assets to cover its outstanding debts and any fiat it owes. 
Since bitcoin debt is not listed as a liability in the bankruptcy proceeding they will not be returned to customers. Of the existing 200k coins, Gox wil argue that 100k+ are Gox's property or some other such nonsense.
There will be a class action lawsuit on behalf of the former customers of Mt. Gox. Assuming the lawsuit is successful and resolved before all the company's assets are disbanded. The lawyer's will take their 30% cut plus expenses  they will send each customer a check which will be small percentage of the total amount owed. 
TLDR: You might recover 10% or so in a couple years but don't bank on it.

Online to online remittance is actually a very small proportion of the remittance market.
Cash remittance transfers are the larger market and require actual people or expensive machines in a network of locations.

You enter a whole different game when you start directly profiting from illegal enterprise.
 It makes it easier to track you, the punishments are more severe and it puts a bigger target on your back.

 It's not even strictly just merchants with the intent of fraud.  
- Company's fall apart all the time. The ability to scale, unforeseen costs, disasters, failure to make a profit and merchants just walking off after losing enthusiasm happens all the time.  Are people really going to sue a now bankrupt company in small claims court and expect any sort of results? 
- Additionally there a whole issue of theft/negligence of postal companies (and the surrounding neighborhood) that also incur increased risk. In the current system each undelivered package costs the merchant/postal company money and thus they make the best effort to make sure that product is delivered. In a reputation system without charge backs a company can afford to let some slip through the cracks (especially if it saves them money).

That prevents sites and internet providers from liability based on harmful content posted by users. The famous example being Craigslist is not liable for illegal erotic services posted by it's users.
If Craigslist held money in escrow for illegal services or intentionally aided the users in illegal services they would be liable.

Last "audit" showed them with a balance 45 BTC more than total deposits (102 Million).  5 Million is indeed a very serious blow.

Even if the file wasn't copied by Ross but instead was given to Ross on May 8th 2012. What good does this do? 
It shows he had possession of the website from at least May 2012 to when he was caught in October 2013. The murder for hire chat logs took place in January 2013. 
 
All the charges would still apply.
@_date: 2015-01-05 07:29:57
Basically they gave him permission to query the total outstanding deposits of customers and than did a send to self bitcoin transaction to show that they had more balance than the deposits.
The problem with that is that doesn't show all the debt and obligations (only the deposits) and it doesn't tell you how long they had the money to cover the deposits or where it came from (I.E it could be loaned amount, a temporary influx in cash or the CEO's yacht and quaaludes fund).

There was two separate investigations. A New York and Baltimore investigation. He was convicted solely based off evidence of the New York investigation. Baltimore investigation had two corrupt officers. 
While it helps him with the Baltimore charges (including the murder for hire) that the Baltimore investigation was corrupt, it doesn't change anything about the New York one (especially since they were the ones that confiscated the laptop)
@_date: 2015-02-04 05:30:41
Except why the fuck would he do this? Why not just take the money, burn the laptop and peace out. 
Once he gets the money (which he had the keys to) he has no obligation to be the fall guy, which is why I find that theory bogus.

Websites have safe harbor laws that protect them from misuse of their sites (Dart v. Craiglist being the famous example of the communication decency act). 
Ulbricht doesn't get that protection because he knowingly promoted and took a cut of illegal sales. If a landlord instead of charging rent, said he'd take 10% of the drugs sold on the premise he'd be just as liable.

Guilty on all counts.

No they can't. Otherwise noone would ever claim ownership 1st time around.

He needed to claim ownership of the server. Otherwise there is no inadmissible evidence because no 4th amendment was breached and therefore no fruit of the poisoned tree.

Sentencing in May.
Narcotics conspiracy:10 year minimum
Engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise: 20 year minimum (life maximum)
Hacking: 5 year maximum
Money laundering: 20 years max

It may very well have been the client who decided on this strategy.  Didn't want his mother/backers confirming his guilt via ownership of the server.

Keep in mind $8 per household is an average value. Not everyone is going to use bitcoin and certainly not all households in america make 100K. 
@_date: 2013-12-06 15:46:49
10% of online sales does not mean 10% of the households will use it. 1-3% of households could very well account for 10% of e-commerce.
