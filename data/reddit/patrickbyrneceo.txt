Of course, there is an issue called, "the United States Securities &amp; Exchange Commission".
It's always the little things, you know? :)

Baby steps, please. Rome wasn't dismantled in a day.

Maybe it was a headshake of disbelief that I could be asked such a dopey question.

First, to all: Thanks for the kind words.
Now, Jaydoors: Great question. The plumbing is designed as follows. In the situation you describe, there would be 90 shares short. Thus, investors would own the 10 shares the company had issued along with the 90 the shorts had created. When the company pays a $1/share dividend ($10), it goes into a pot at the DTCC. Everyone who is short has to come up with $1/share themselves ($90). Those all get paid into a different pot in the DTCC. Then the $100 in the two pots are pumped out to the 100 people who think they own a share. Since everyone gets $1, none of them can tell whether they own one of the real shares or one of the fake shares.
But actually, there is a way, but almost nobody knows it. If you are getting a $1 from the company, that is indeed a dividend, and you should pay the normal tax rate on dividends (15%). However, if you hold one of the shares that was manufactured by the system, your $1 check will come marked with a little "PIL" on it. That stands for "Payment In Lieu" (of an real dividend). Technically, the tax rate on that PIL is your ordinary income tax rate (probably 36% or so). In my experience with investors, essentially no one knows this, and so they pay at the 15% rate. Which means, technically, that the IRS is getting cheated. If they ever enforced this distinction (which I have never heard of them doing, and in fact, it is not clear to me that the IRS understands this stuff any better than the SEC) and people did have to pay differential tax rates, then it would mean that the two kinds of shares were not truly fungible, and they would therefore be worth different amounts. Maybe the reason the IRS does not enforce this is because there is a lot riding on people not understanding that the stock market is a game of fractional reserve banking without a reserve requirement.
Now the disclaimers and fine print: I am not a lawyer or CPA, and have no business giving tax or legal advice. Consult your own lawyer or tax professional when preparing your taxes. California highway mileage will be lower. Don't run with that stick you'll poke someone's eye out. If it's messy, eat it over the sink.

Actually, this is quite a deep article. He is (along with Cade Metz at Wired) the first journalist I know who is getting the implications of crypto for political philosophy.
