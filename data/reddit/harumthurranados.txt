Does that give people incentive to seed by giving them a cryptocurrency?

Could you perhaps sponsor an E-fedding team?

That's...really rude if that's really the case.

Upvoted. However, am I risking anything by using the old app that was on the Apple store or is it fine for conventional use?

Why not just use Coinbase merchant app which immediately turns the Bitcoins received into cash?
@_date: 2014-06-03 06:05:26
Bitcoin is not as big as the internet. Don't fool yourself. Sure, it's innovative but it won't be that huge.

After all Bitcoins have been mined, the transaction fees will be enormous because many people will use Bitcoin. The transaction fees in total will amount for more BTC than what miners are getting now. Those transactions fees will be awarded for mining.
@_date: 2014-03-06 17:31:02
I believe it
@_date: 2014-03-05 22:22:04
I would actually like this. Are there any other apps that keep track of multiple cryptocurrencies and not just Bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-03-05 22:27:47
Although many financial experts have said Bitcoin would greatly benefit third-world countries / countries suffering from extreme inflation, I'm sure it's not going to be an easy path. The learning curve on Bitcoin is pretty steep, and a lot of these people have never seen a computer in their lives. You would have to teach them how to use a computer, a smartphone (for BTC transactions), how to generate keys, how to protect their BTC, etc.
I believe in Bitcoin but if we want this to be huge, it's going to take a lot of education to have it truly take off in those hyper-inflation countries. A country that can benefit from it NOW, though, is Argentina. I've heard that their coins are losing value and quickly. Argentina is advanced enough for Bitcoin to take off there.

You're a dick, but you made me laugh.
@_date: 2014-03-28 08:34:43
Not sure if I'm correct, but it looks like it's an Apple only app.
@_date: 2014-03-20 00:21:19
Blockchain.info was down that day so I didn't want to travel all the way there just for them to tell me, "Sorry, it doesn't look like it's working" so I was going to ask if they were using Blockchain.info's app. If they said no, then I would've gone. 
@_date: 2014-03-18 09:55:46
"However, not having access to one's money is not far behind on the scale of incompetence"
What are you talking about? Blockchain.info allows you access to your private keys, they are not in control of them. If you were either
1. Knowledgeable about Bitcoin
2. Smart with your MONEY
You would have a .aes.json wallet file stored somewhere as a back-up. I needed to use Bitcoins today, and couldn't due to Blockchain so you know what I did? I imported my private keys onto Multi Bit and then moved it to Coinbase.
So, you and others who are quick to shoot judgment on other people/entities need to cool off and stop spurting bullshit all over the sub.
"However, not having access to one's money is not far behind on the scale of incompetence. "


"After using your service twice in the past 2 months and both times having my transactions go unconfirmed for hours"


"You're not ready for prime time.
Come back when you are"


@_date: 2014-03-20 00:15:27
This is actually pretty cool. I use their services often and I may donate to them one of these days.
@_date: 2014-03-08 23:23:57
Coinbase is not exchange, it's just a place where you buy Bitcoin or sell it, but directly to Coinbase versus other people. 
@_date: 2014-06-09 01:46:21
No, internet has nothing to do with it.
@_date: 2014-03-18 10:34:19
For some, yes. Me and all my friends only have that as an option. Find me a working trusted wallet on the Apple store.
@_date: 2014-03-06 16:57:30
I know this is a shit post, but I just couldn't help but laugh.
@_date: 2014-03-05 20:08:25
Exactly. I just hope everything goes well for them.
@_date: 2014-03-10 19:31:11
You don't need money to get  Bitcoin, you can just work for it (mining).
@_date: 2014-04-06 07:46:33
I already sent them an E-mail but perhaps you guys can convince them on how to accept Bitcoin, it would be great for them and the publicity!
@_date: 2014-03-11 00:01:44
They said your cost is to give up a portion of your hard drive space for the sake of the network. Not many will do that without incentive.
@_date: 2014-03-18 19:29:25
Exactly, there is NO option besides the Bitcoin apps we had already downloaded... That being Blockchain which I still have and use 
@_date: 2014-03-05 22:24:10
This is a very uncommon problem with Blockchain and I have seen it happen before. Oftentimes, all that's needed is to rebroadcast the transaction. Upon looking at the transaction, it has 8 confirmations so it looks like that has happened. 
@_date: 2014-04-04 18:28:17
Hey, thanks for that tool.

This is a mining group in the deep web that go by that same name.

Alright. I'll just point him to this thread since he knows a little bit more than me when he gets back from his flight.

Question: Where is the "Bitcoin Accepted" sign? I bought a walking dead comic there with Bitcoin and all I saw was the "B" symbol but nothing more.
@_date: 2014-04-07 04:07:31
So it never occurred to you that even if it was "blocked", people would still be able to use it if they downloaded it just like Flappy Bird?

Could you find a way to add the blue sweater from Gracie Jujitsu? I want that one and I'll buy it from you with Bitcoins.

What's funny about it? I use my iPhone to pay at restaurants with BTC.
@_date: 2014-04-04 15:50:12
I agree with you. I have Chase, nothing has happened to me yet.
@_date: 2014-03-17 09:16:44
Sorry, this is just the first place I thought of that could maybe help me out. I'm also partially asking what other company sells BTC instantly without needing a CC (I have a debit card only).
@_date: 2014-03-31 16:53:10
If you have an iPhone I know that there's an app that will permit you to log into your Coinbase account. Download "authy" and try to send a message to your phone through COINBASE for 2FA. You should see a code on the authy app. Use this code in order to get in. Keep I mind that the code only lasts for approximately twenty seconds and then authy will generate a completely new code. I learned this by going through the COINBASE chat support.

You would get constant exposure from a logo on our website and from our members:
- Our website and all the regular members who attend (~20-30 stable per day)
- The guests that consider joining the E-fed (Up to 70 at times per day, most ever was slightly over 200 in a day)
- You'd get exposure from every wrestler who has a twitter, such as Tony Miranda, one of our top superstars not to mention the person's real life social media (Me, for example, with 900 + friends would have no problem spreading the word for the health of the fed)
- When we enter the RoughKut E-fed tournaments, a tournament that involves nearly a hundred wrestlers spanning from 10+ E-feds (all of which are small communities like ours), we could use your logos in our contracts to enter the tournaments. Thus, you'd get easily a couple hundred individuals being exposed to Axiom)
- Our members/community would not have a problem advertising for you. I go to a University with 50k-100k students. I would have no problem using some of the money to spread the word around my university by posting fliers around. I can send you a picture of each single poster I place and its location. This is in California. One of the admins in our website goes to another university named Rice University, he can also advertise there and would be more than willing to do us. 
And here's the best part:
**It doesn't even need to be 4000-5000 spent on your budget**
We realize we smaller, but our members would do everything in their power to help. Still, since you'd likely only get a couple thousand to view your advertisement,  we wouldn't expect you to spend that much with us. If you'd like to negotiate a smaller amount with us, feel free to message me on Reddit.
Here's the thing though - having Bitcoin on a T-shirt may get a mention or two, but it won't do what I can do.I am passionate about Bitcoin and know enough to teach people the very basics and get them started. The retention rate of the people we advertise for would be immense versus simply being seen on a T-shirt. You get more people looking at Bitcoin, but with us, you can get us effectively spreading the message and having people understand it - which is the most important thing. I go to UCLA. For some of your money, I would have no problem setting up a table on Bruinwalk and advertising and teaching.

I never said people would flock to it, I just said there was the potential for people to flock but I agree, putting money in Bitcoin is a risk, but the Argentinian peso has been declining for years upon years now. 
I disagree on the precious metals, but I'd go with dollars. 
@_date: 2014-03-28 08:27:58
No. The moment he does this, Apple will take his app down. Haven't we all learned this lesson already?
@_date: 2014-04-24 02:14:41
Really? Doesn't Coinbase have an option for that?
@_date: 2014-04-24 07:01:16
I saw this as I tried to get my mom to learn English. That was quite unexpected, to read that.
@_date: 2014-03-30 02:54:03
I'd do it, quite frankly. 
@_date: 2014-03-18 10:23:31
From my experience using Blockchain nearly over a year, this is the first time it's ever been down. Besides, for a big chunk of Apple users, the Blockchain app is the only option to pay using Bitcoins.
@_date: 2014-03-12 18:34:13
This is good news that they are refunding BTC instead of a gift card or something. Way to go Overstock, can't wait to buy my new TV from there.
@_date: 2014-03-18 02:21:48
MR. Blockchain Wallet, are you guys working on making a new app that will get approved by Apple? I'm still using your old app, should I experience any problems using it?
@_date: 2014-03-12 07:06:44
Honestly, I'm probably going to see downvotes for this but I like that news reporter. Every time Patrick Byrne has appeared on Fox Business, and she's interviewed him, she's never asked a stupid question and she remains respectful. People will shit on her simply for working for Fox, but I think she does a good job regarding the Bitcoin side of things.
@_date: 2014-03-08 23:29:05
Coinbase does handle security to some degree, but Coinbase themselves recommend not to keep with them or in an exchange. We all saw what happened with Mt. Gox and you just never know what might happen to these exchanges. It's better to have it in cold storage.
@_date: 2014-03-05 20:01:04
I'm not anti-Bitcoin but sounds a lot like Overstock. Failing companies are using Bitcoin to get users re-interested in them and quite frankly, it's pretty smart.
@_date: 2014-03-18 03:50:03
Alright, thanks a lot. Keep on being awesome. 
@_date: 2014-03-05 22:19:25

Cool, and one last question - I'm dying to use some BTC with my friends right now at a restaurant but I only have an Apple phone and can only pay using the old Blockchain app. When will Blockchain be available again?  Any ETA?
@_date: 2014-03-16 04:28:47
Invite me, please! I'm very interested in this and I would find this very useful. Thank you!
@_date: 2014-03-10 22:41:46
Can you explain this?
@_date: 2014-03-08 23:46:06
Those 3 forms of cold storage that you mentioned are all wallets. So, you have 3 wallets and more than likely, 3 addresses. On Coinbase, you can purchase Bitcoins with instant buy and have Bitcoins immediately. After having them, you can send those Bitcoins to one of the addresses on your wallets. Once it's sent, it'll be in your new address/wallet in seconds.  Then, you can store that wallet on your computer and back it up on a USB drive, etc. This is not cold storage, but it's an easy way to store Bitcoins rather safely.
You can go print your private key somewhere and lock it away as DarkShadowGirl said. This is the most secure, but more hassle.
