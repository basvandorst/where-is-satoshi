I don't think the IRS is going to really get into the "weeds" of BTC until people start reporting trading losses.  They love the income and taxes.  As soon as someone files a return with 1M of capital losses offsetting capital gains from stocks and bonds, they will become very interested.
After many years I can attest, taxing authority agents are generally not very smart people.  They are very sharp ones for sure, but most of them are bureaucrats that are basically following a checklist.  I have heaps of stories about revenue agents just missing the obvious rout to get more tax money in favor of just wasting their own time.  I don't tell them they are fishing in the wrong part of the ocean, I simply supply them with bait and cool beverages.

+1.  I was going to say that.  Consider Microsoft, before they had the antitrust case they spent pretty much $0 on lobbying.  After the case, they spend millions a year on lobbying politicians.  They figured out the game.  
I envision a future of BTC where it is regulated and either banks facilitate purchases in the US, or bitcoin stores that operate like banks.  I doubt the US government will let bitcoin bypass FinCEN and bank secrecy/corruption rules. I see the regulations getting pushed by banks so that they can step in and be the main conduit.

The idea from Congress is that they want to encourage people to "invest" and not "trade" so they provide preferential tax rates to encourage one over the other.  Capital gains is pretty much the only area that the tax code favors the taxpayer.  One example is that if you have short term gains and long term losses you can net them, even though the short term gains are a higher tax rate.

"Stocks used to be held in paper certificates. In that case, obviously, you would have the location of the paper.
Now they are database entries. That still leaves you with the location of whatever entity runs the database (bank, stock broker etc)."
Although these statements are TRUE, in the context of taxation-specifically income taxation-the location of certificates is irrelevant.  They are deemed to be the same residence as the owner.  This is important when you are looking at state income tax.  Otherwise a California or New York resident would just "deposit" the certificate in Nevada, Florida, Alaska, Texas (or any other state with no income tax) to escape paying state income tax on interest and dividends.  So in the context of stocks and bonds ANY way to correlate physical location other than residency is ignored.  
In that regard I believe that they are quite a good proxy for the same concept as a Bitcoin.  Even if I was to make a paper wallet and put them in a safety deposit box in the Grand Cayman (or any other country without taxation of wealth upon death) they would not legally "escape" taxation.  
Of course this is the moment when people start saying "How would the taxing authorities know?" and the answer is not a good proxy for legality of tax sheltering.

Glad to hear your refund is scheduled.  As a tax accountant I want to say that if you file a return they pretty much pop out a refund matching your return.  At some point down the road they look at it in more depth.  The only times that make an immediate change or hold is if there is something glaring.  For example: claimed too much tax, recapturing refund due to delinquent student loans or alimony, or a large amount of W2 withholdings are being refunded (i.e. 2M of W-2 withholdings and getting back 400K).  
I have seen notices of audit a week before the statute of limitations expires (3 years).  I don't think the IRS will be quick to jump on BTC yet, especially since most people who self report will be showing gains.  I would give the IRS another year to really create some firm guidance and then perhaps a little amnesty period.  They did amnesty more than once for all the people who had unreported unnamed foreign bank accounts (thanks Lichtenstein!).
So stay tuned.  I commend you for being honest and self reporting your income.

@_date: 2014-03-07 18:33:21
I have said it before.  I use a large national bank.  When I decided to start cashing out BTC I went into a branch and sat down with an accounts person and informed them that I had some holdings of BTC that I was going to liquidate.  I gave them a projected amount and timeline.  Showed them proof of aquisition and current price.  I did not have any problems.  I do think if I had not said anything, when 10K started showing up in my account every day for a few weeks I know they would have freaked.  For me, being proactive when I KNOW i might worry the bank is better than waiting for my account to be frozen.  Like you I use coinbase (hate the fees and spread) but it is much more reputable than an international wire transfer.

How many bitcoins do you have?
@_date: 2014-02-21 17:56:12
In these situations it is IMO best to be proactive.  Before I started cashing out bitcoins I went to my banker and had a meeting.  I explained that I had purchased bitcoins in the past (showed supporting evidence) and that they had increased in value and that I would be using coinbase deposits to cash some of my holdings out.  I informed him of the estimated amount that I planned to liquidate and the time period I planned.  I assured him that I intended to pay capital gains tax on all my realized gains.  I didn't have an issue when I cashed out.  I figured that if they started to see large deposits they would flag me and getting unflagged or unfrozen could be more work (i.e. outside of the hands of my local bank manager).  Instead if they held me up I can say "Look i met with X on such a date and discussed this and he did not raise any objections."

Assuming treatment as a capital asset, any losses would be subject to the wash sale rules.  A wash sale is when you realize a loss on the disposition of a capital asset and you also reacquire a substantially similar position within 30 days before or after the loss.  As an example, I have shares of GOOG that I acquired at $800.  I sell them at $650.  And then repurchase my position.  Essentially I am "harvesting" a loss without changing my economic position.  The loss is not lost entirely, since it is used to adjust your basis and will be recognized for tax purposes when you dispose of it outside of a wash sale.  In my example my new basis of GOOG shares is $650 a piece.  
In your example, when you are paid in assets in exchange for labor you should recognize the income at fair market value the date it is received which will be your basis in the assets.  If you recognized no income when you were given BTC then your basis would be $0.  It would be impossible to have a loss (unless you paid someone to take the Bitcoin from you).  You don't ever just "get" basis for free.     
Edit: these rules are US tax.  And, the tax rules are designed to tie economic events with tax events (it doesn't always work out that way, Subpart F income, phantom income from K-1s, etc.)

They only threaten jail if you won't pay your adjusted tax liability and you engage in fraud.  I had a client that lied to me and the IRS for years about not having 10M in Hong Kong.  Eventually the investigator was able to prove it.  Last I heard he wasnt in jail (even though i expected it) since the led investigator retired.  I was told that they simply "boxed up" her office and didn't followup.  
But, I wouldn't risk jail either.  I do think its unfortunate that taxing authorities tend to "punish" people that self report.  
1) I had an estate that I worked on and we discovered quite a few unreported taxable gifts.  We filed back gift tax returns with interest.  The IRS demanded penalties.  I was rather honest with them "you would know about this or have the money if we didn't tell you.  please abate the penalties."  After a few months they decided to agree with me.
2) I had a client who imported about 30M of art into CA.  Since the art was purchased in a sales tax free jurisdiction she owed "use tax" to CA.  She decided she wanted to "do the right thing" and pay the use tax (i had created a legal way of avoiding the tax by "loaning" the art to a museum for a year).  She now gets audited every year by CA to "check for unreported art work."

As a tax accountant in the United States which specializes in Estate Planning the following are my thoughts:
Where are the bitcoins?  I think I close proxy for this situation would be how tax authorities see "intangibles" like stocks and bonds.  Suppose the deceased owns 2M of GOOG.  Where is the stock?  In the US, this is an issue for the states (CA, NY, etc.).  The stock is located where the deceased was a resident.  So if we apply that logic, it would seem to me that if the bitcoin holder was a US resident (and the US has an estate tax that is on all worldwide assets) then the US tax authority would consider the bitcoins to be taxable.  There are some countries that don't tax "intangibles" like stocks and in those cases it wouldn't matter.
so, bottom line, I would say they reside in the same country as the deceased.  
@_date: 2014-02-13 18:15:09
Karpeles shouldn't be blaming the old technology.  They should have been upgrading from 2011 forward.

One should keep in mind that one "feature" of fiat is that you *must* accept it for payment, you can not refuse without violating the law.  Weather you are accepting fiat, bitcoins, or sticks of butter in exchange of services you must follow the regulations on that industry.  If you normally need a license, accepting bitcoin will not diminish that responsibility.
Consider this, if one of the goals of bitcoin is to be accepted as a currency, should you not treat exchanges of goods/services for it the same as and other currency?  If I open an unlicensed barber shop, is it okay if I only accept euros?  I am not a "big government" guy, but I do worry that as a culture that bitcoiners will reject regulation and be seen as anarchists.  In could hurt wide spread adoption if we act in a way that makes others dislike us.  
For example, I love to cycle.  Many cyclists violate traffic laws all the time (why stop at a stop sign, I can blow right through like I am riding in the tour de france).  Yet they get enraged when they feel like motorists dont respect cyclists.  To a degree I can see how motorists get tired of seeing cyclists violate the rules of road and then claim them when it is convenient (I have the same rights as a car!  Dont pass unless there is a safe amount of distance).  I tend to think of these conflicts as the "I only want this when it is convenient for me, otherwise no."

Google, Facebook, and Apple clearly own the foreign held money and they *do* report the income to the respective taxing authorities.  The structure they use is built around international tax treaties.  If governments dont like it, then they can change or rescind the tax treaties.

My sentiment.  Doesn't matter what the government says if the government doesn't survive.  I doubt anyone in America really cares what laws King George created for the Colonies.

I think many are missing a point though.  I believe that although Cryptsy and MtGox are coding exchanges they do not have the broader business understanding that they should.  I am an accountant (tax not auditing), and to me the idea that 1,000 coins can disappear over a period of time *before* being noticed just tells me that no one is periodically verifying what they should have on hand.  This should not be hard.  Take a snap shot once a week.  You should be able to know every account holders balances.  You should know how much transactional fees you have taken and are holding.  The sum of those should equal your wallet balance totals.  If you cant verify that your holding the correct amount of coins then you need to find someone to help.  Hire an accountant, get an engagement with a firm that offers assurance services, or hire someone with a basic inventory understanding.  I think in general you have some code people (we all can debate their skill set) and no one with any idea how to run a business.

Did he file a gift tax return last year?  If so, it wouldn't be a "complete" return unless he reported this gift.  That would super random to be listed on his gift tax return.

Assuming US taxes here:
when considering income threshold to file you *should* consider gains/losses in that calc. (since your first question includes "gains" for anyone in that situation)
Assuming you are not mark to market treatment and that your treatment of the coins would capital: If you have losses, realized losses (not "paper", you legit sold/exchanged coins for less than your basis) you may want to file to capture your capital loss carryover that you will be able to use against future gains and limited to 3K of net losses each year.

This is so true.  The first Accounting Firm I worked at was partially owned by a bank.  I had to get a background check and submit finger prints, when I was an intern and when I got hired full time.
