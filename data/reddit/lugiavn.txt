Nah, it's newbie common thinking it's wrong unfortunately :/

Hm I'm not sure what Coinbase's ideology is, and I'm not protecting them either.
It's just silly to me when anyone is hating on anyone else for no good reason. In that sense I guess I want to protec everyone ;)
@_date: 2017-12-01 01:42:19
No, we want to buy low and sell high what are you talking about?

Hey man, I've never said I love wealth more than whatever, sure everyone loves money, but don't twist words, don't just make up assumption to spread hate, don't divide us; we must unite! Whether you are male or female, gay or straight, bitcoiner or buttcoiner we are in this together. One man alone can not make bitcoin rate surge, one man alone can not make this the mainstream currency. Don't you see you and I we are not so different. Lets ride this train together brothers, to the bright future, to the unity of mankind!

Hey what you said is not wrong. What I meant is that when the price goes down you lose when the price goes up you gain.
Of course it can goes down or go back up again, but at THAT MOMENT in time, you have less monetary value than before whether it's measured in dollar or bitcoin.
You should make an informed decision (whether to cut loss or hodl), nothing wrong with believing it's worth a lambo in the FUTURE, but thinking "right now it's still the same 19k as long as I'm not selling at 11k" is just fooling yourself

Wasn't there a dip a week ago when it reached 11k for the 1st time

Hey, that is simply my opinion (after using coinbase for only a little while, and after reading others people opinion here). But hey, I'm always open to be convinced otherwise.
You are right. Somebody said, the only thing that you can 100% sure is that you can not 100% sure about anything.

RemindMe! 1 year

agreed, not that it's ATH, but the price at that point was exploding at ridiculous rate that it was scaring the shit out of people, I set up a bunch of stop sell order before gdax freezed. Definitely not a good time to buy unless you were a newbie and had the fear of missing out
@_date: 2017-12-01 02:40:22
Well lets call it a discussion, so it's 2 ways.
(actually I'm just throwing my opinion out there in this case)
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:31:06


Exactly, we all are
I'm money's sheep, you guys are Satoshi's sheep; we are the same stop the hating lol
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:18:44
So what, it's not like I hate the bank
I don't care about Satoshi's ideology or about the whole peer-to-peer, decentralized shit.
I don't care about coinbase or the banks either, but what's with the hating lol
Let be real, most people here, including me, are just riding the wave to make quick money, nobody uses yet it as a currency.
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:38:53
That is right, you all think that only centralized currency is regulated by the government or manipulated by the banks? Bad news, bitcoin or whatever is no exception, the mass can be easily influenced, some entity out there is manipulating it for sure hahah
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:44:42
That is right my friend, I'm here for those internet magic money buttcoins

Because what you said is true and naive, maybe you are young.
"If everyone in the world could just send me a cent, I would be a millionaire"
Some people think that if they convince a couple of others to buy/sell, same as them then they can control the market (examples FUD &amp; hodl meme), maybe they feel better if there's others on the same boat as them; it doesn't matter they are just tricking themselves. Worse, they blame others for their financial decision, I've seen someone posted here he/she sold, and some people really got out of their way to attack/insult viciously the guy on the personal level lol
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:08:08
You are right, I think not even one of them is true right now let alone both
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:00:39
This comment is really silly lol

Which is a legitimate business. There's youtube videos about how to make youtube videos (&amp; develop channel &amp; monetize), udemy courses about how to make udemy courses and books about how to write books (&amp; get it published)
