Simply because this idea of a government ban or restriction was floating around during a conversation earlier among friends, I decided to open a coinbase account and buy a small amount of bitcoin currency.
I'd say, given how Americans tend to react to bans or restrictions, any big rumor or newspaper article about a ban or restriction would only encourage more people to buy bitcoins. We're an ornery lot in this country.

Great explanation. Enjoy your gold.

Exactly why I'm here asking, the purchase is supposed to go through on the 18th and I realized I didn't have any ideas where to spend them. :)

Much *higher*, you say? ;)

Is there another step past verifying my phone to enable the two factor authentication? I thought that was all there was to it.

It did, so that's good and done. :)

You appear to have a skewed idea of both India and the many countries in Africa.

Perfect! Thanks for somewhere to start, I didn't know Humble Bundle accepted bitcoins. I'm always purchasing indie games, so this sounds like a good place to start for me.
Edit... there's a comic book and games store right near where I live that accepts bitcoins. That's even better, an in person purchase for my first try.

Is that your address? I'm not quite that dumb. You put a smile on my face for sure though! ;)

Probably someone advising that andreasma spend the counterfeit bills. I see people advise that nearly every time counterfeit bills come up in conversation, and it's never a good idea.
