You just can't help yourself, can you? I feel sad for you, seek professional help.

Can't find it googling. Do you have a link?

financial market infrastructures. [...]


blockchain. **A good way to overcome this barrier is to adopt a worldwide standard for
blockchain. The standard should be open source** and sufficiently detailed in order to allow
exchange of information between blockchains, where permitted. **Some initiatives are
already underway** but no doubt further experiments are necessary.
The author just invented Bitcoin.

The question was:


You say one can find this with Google.

Use bitcoin, it is not restricted by artificial boundaries.

Yeah, those kind of people were not around before Bitcoin.

The company is Blockchain**.info**, Bitcoin's blockchain sees a lot of keys.
But good arguments!
@_date: 2016-11-26 10:16:16
Which it was not intended to be.

Both payments will confirm. You can send as many payments to a single address as you like.
@_date: 2016-12-13 07:06:02
That is interesting! Any data to support that claim?

Gives the average price based on the exchanges volume (scroll down a bit).

Do you own your private keys? Else you don't own your bitcoins.
@_date: 2016-12-18 08:08:56
Enter the transaction ID on blockchain.info to verify it has been seen by the network. If that is the case it should confirm, if a proper fee is used. Otherwise it will eventually return into your wallet.
What wallet are you using? You could rescan if you are using Core/BU/XT etc:

Sell 99?

Install Breadwallet / Mycelium on your phone and write down 12 words as a backup. Everybody is perfectly fine managing their own private keys. 
You only need to use these Bitcoin banks to quickly convert your fiat into bitcoin.

And well written Spidy!

In quite a few European countries, including Spain, the decimal separator is a comma.

What about just insane inflation in Venezuela. If you had 500% inflation this year, and likely 1700% next year (IMF stats) it is a no brainer. Don't pavlov your dark market remark, you use cash for that nonsense (or recently Monero).

Wonder why this is not upvoted more.
@_date: 2016-10-22 18:38:58
Seems to be a local bitcoins problem. Don't worry.

It might be daytime elsewhere in the world (I know, it is shocking).
