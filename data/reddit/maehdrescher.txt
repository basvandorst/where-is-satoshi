Well you are right with the possibility of using a Mixer in terms of hiding where the BTC were transferred to, but if one really wants to get a step further and tries to hide the fact hat he even has bought a certain amount of Bitcoin at some time, ATMs are still the only way to go. I think of a long-term storage here. Leaking the identity over the Bitcoin protocol itself shouldn't be a problem if you use Tor or just use some public Wi-Fi.

I wouldn't say ATMs are useless. The fees are quite high, yes (3-4% here in Vienna though, 6-8% sounds really insane to me!) but buying bitcoins at an ATM has the advantage of anonymity. It is the only way to get sure that absolutely NO ONE even knows that you even bought BTC. Whenever you buy over an exchange, the exchange knows your identity and what you spent the BTC for and you can be tracked. But even without knowing your identity, you have to transfer the dollars somehow and this transaction reveals that you spent money for BTC.

Not all, I can say here in Vienna/Austria for example we have a Bitcoin ATM where you can buy for up to 250 Euros per transaction without ID.
@_date: 2016-08-17 13:16:27
6-8% is insane, but 10-15% is really an unbounded cheek!
No ID required here in Vienna/Austria, it says the buying limit for one Bitcoin address is set at 250 EUR per day. But of course, by using multiple addresses, this limit can be easily bypassed... so for buying a total of x € you just need "x / 250.0" (rounded up) different wallet addresses.

Not a huge fan of banks either, but you are linking to a price list of a bank in Czech Republic here, not Switzerland! Prices are in CZK, where the current conversation rate is 1 CZK = 0.043 USD. So applying the correct informations to your sentence: "A czech bank account costs $4,26 to $32,31 per month. As student, you only pay $2,11."
Don't be naive, no bank would have regular customers with your claimed astronomic prices.

Satoshi was a genius primarily focused on the technology and for sure had tons of other worries and areas to put his/her/their energy into back then than coming up with a name that provides a good analogy for people to get the concept. Fact is, if you tell most people a word which cointains "coin" they immediately get a picture in their mind, in this case a quite misleading one.

I like it, but would strongly recommend to replace "coin" by "currency".
The "coin" terminology for digital currency is actually quite flawed, e.g. it only amplifies the widespread misbelief that whole Bitcoins are the smallest unit ("I can't afford to buy Bitcoin, only one unit is already worth several hundred dollars!" we all have certrainly heard that at least once, and I can't even blame anyone, real coins can't also be divided, right?).
@_date: 2017-01-12 10:52:13
The unit thing was only one example why the term coin is a flawed analogy to explain Bitcoin. Andreas Antonopoulos puts it a little harsher this way:

Think of it like it this: on average every single person on earth will have only 21000000/7000000000=0.003 BTC. So you already have 100 times the average. Congratulations!

That sounds like a pretty fun mini-project for getting into the bitcoin core source code, will probably try that out myself soon as well.

As suggested by statoshi I created a SQL query running on  which displays all the UTXOs addresses matching the pattern. The result is created with the basic structure 
*"ALL transaction outputs to addresses with prefix '1xyz...'"* **minus** *"transaction outputs to addresses with prefix '1xyz...'" that are used in any transaction input"*
Here is the query:
    select distinct ToAddress from (
        select TransactionID, ToAddress from
            TransactionOutput where ToAddress like '1xyz%' except
        select TransactionOutput.TransactionID, ToAddress from
            TransactionInput inner join TransactionOutput on 
            TransactionInput.TransactionOutputID = TransactionOutput.ID where ToAddress like '1xyz%'
    ) utxos

This is awesome, being able to query the blockchain via SQL, thank you very much for the hint! This is pretty much what I was looking for. I'll try out setting up a JOIN operation for non-zero balances, let you know what I came up with.
@_date: 2016-09-10 00:33:49
Nice, a modern user interface like this is what I was hoping for, thanks for the hint! In comparison other popular block explorers seem to be quite lame in my opinion. Just think of people new to bitcoin trying looking up their balance of e.g. a paper wallet you gave them. When they need to type in the whole long address without any feedback this can easily lead to frustration. Now with this explorer, my friend only needs to type in the first letters of the vanity address and will find it easily with only a few keystrokes. Actually small things like this can make a huge difference for mainstream acceptance.
@_date: 2016-09-09 15:49:27
Thank you, I already found a quite easy way using  as suggested by statoshi's answer. Still I would be interested how you got the UTXO set, especially in a text form (I assume it is since you can grep it)?

Congratulations for claiming control over your funds, away from blockchain.info!
But, tell me, why are so many people here pressurized to move their holdings to SegWit addresses as fast as possible? One could almost get the impression that non-segwit addresses will be declared as invalid soon (which is of course nonsense, legacy addresses starting with 1... will always be valid) and people start to panic. As a long-term HODLer I see currently zero reason to move my funds to a new segwit address.

How about simply using a market like bitcoin.de? You pay via wire transfer directly to the person where you buy from, the bank wouldn't know that this transfer belongs to a bitcoin order.

This is what I did recently with approx. the same amount of BTC in my mobile wallet: order pizza! Worked like a charm, the merchant used BitPay as a payment processor, which confirmed the payment within a few seconds (which I found surprising since the confirmations on the blockchain always took at least 10-15 min., so BitPay is obviously taking the risk here) However, for 0.0163 BTC I got a delicious margherita with coke and a donut ;-)
HODLing can't hurt either though.

Probably not in depth study, but definitely interesting is also Andreas Antonopoulos' appearance in the Joe Rogan Experience:
 (January 2014)
 (April 2014)
 (December 2014)
Andreas does an excellent job here explaining Bitcoin and its impact to people who start from absolutely zero. It's nice to see how Rogan is getting more and more conviced over time.

Nice, love the idea of combining geocaching with bitcoin!
@_date: 2016-07-27 23:28:50
It's perfectly safe. Just get sure that there is no digital copy left of the paper wallet in the offline computer and also in the printer (!). Personally I also prefer to add password-encryption (BIP38, also supported by bitaddress) to paper wallets as well, so it's less risky to store the paper wallet in multiple places -- even if someone is able to steal it, without the password it's useless. The drawback is that if you e.g. die or get alzheimer and haven't stored the password somewhere, the coins are lost forever.

Using the Ledger Nano on Arch Linux with Chromium works fine here, though I had to create udev rules. Did you already follow those steps? 
I would also be interested about experiences from Linux users on other hardware wallets, especially the Trezor.

Solve issues on github and get paid in bitcoins:  It seems that this project hasn't really launched yet (there are only 4 bitcoin-payable issues so far), so we have to wait for the future.
Another similar possibility is by getting bountys for development improvements, e.g.:
