So my Google Pixel 2 is not tangible. The software that they develop doesn't have worth? The iPhone is not physical? All the servers that they have created in order for the internet to actually work doesn't have worth? All the jobs that stem from these companies is nothing? Bitcoin merely floats inside of these systems that they have developed over countless years. Bitcoin still has to be valued by USD. It is only worth what people decide it is worth. It has nothing tied to it that equates it's worth to anything that can be relative to something tangible. It can sway from one end to the other just because. You keep saying mining but what is that coming from. Generally, when I was looking into it, it came from a PC that sat there and did some kind of encryption for the purpose of what? In the real world it doesn't have any meaningful value. It just has a stamp of how much time that a computer created to make this digital signature of another thing. It doesn't mean anything...

How is it wrong if that is the perspective of the value of what you're describing vs what I'm saying? Something is only as valuable as what someone is willing to pay for it. I don't see or understand the value in any of this. It's all generated from nothing and somehow it's worth something just because. I don't buy it, and I won't buy it because it's value to me is zero. Can't pay my bills with it so what's the point...

I'm with you. I don't understand the value of something, generated from nothing, now worth something because...?, that you never have physical contact with... What is its value based on other than, well we say so?
