Makes it cheaper to export and tourism more appealing.

It's a material that could be used to make stuff.

Thank you :).

Aren't they backed by hardware that has been invested in to run Bitcoins?
@_date: 2014-11-06 19:25:55
Wow. I want to help make Panama like this.

I suggest we use more social networks to start a massive bitcoin adoption trend, and to hash tag Venezuela.
@_date: 2014-12-02 08:35:55
That's probably because people in Venezuela have a lack of dollars to buy bitcoins. Have you heard anything since the last time you asked about whether people there are buying bitcoins?
@_date: 2014-10-27 14:43:56
In what forum?
@_date: 2014-11-06 19:14:58
Where was this picture taken?
@_date: 2015-01-11 17:20:39
Totally, but lying isn't necessary. I'm going to try to get the store I work at to accept them, and talk to other local business owners. 100 bits @_date: 2015-01-11 01:29:04
I tried to do this but with correcting misconceptions about Bitcoin as opposed to votes, and I got reported. Not cool.

You're welcome :).

So neither the person paying or the person receiving pay anything unless the amount is less than a certain number or greater than another number? Where does the block money come from then?

100 bits @_date: 2015-01-10 18:10:58
Yeah, but it's a question that's probably commonly asked, and I looked at the original code by Satoshi on Github, but it seems quite complicated.

Cool. I'm going to request permission from the national university to use its largest auditorium to give a presentation about Bitcoin. I also want to see if companies like Bitpay are willing to sponsor the presentation since I'd have to pay to use large auditoriums.

Nice! Keep it up. 100 bits @_date: 2015-01-11 23:39:29

Great idea.
@_date: 2015-01-13 18:13:41
Yeah! 100 bits @_date: 2015-01-12 22:26:09
Not really; more like to start a normal business like a co-op, but to get funding for it from a Bitcoin company to help us get started, and we'd offer discounts to consumers who use bitcoins.

Here's your second tip ever: 100 bits @_date: 2015-01-10 19:58:45
I didn't know. Sorry.
@_date: 2015-01-11 18:42:49
Cool! 100 bits Also, can you please notify us when the good stuff begins, and which team you recommend, @_date: 2015-01-10 23:08:41
I wasn't aware that it's not allow. I'm sorry.
