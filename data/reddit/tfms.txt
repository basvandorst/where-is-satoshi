I have a HD6490M (decent card). Unfortunately I am going to scrap this project. I just realized that the card doesn't support OpenCL. I'll probably end up investing in a higher end graphics card and build a rig for that. Thanks for all the help

While I am in complete agreement that bitcoin over long distances is more convenient then cash. But I was not attacking the long distance application of bitcoin, I was questioning the short distance application of it. It is not like you send cash over the mail
The main advantage of cash is in its convenience and universality (and note once again, this is "short" distance). I can give $X USD instantly and without much hassle and it is acceptable nearly everywhere (or at least very easily convertible). I just do not see bitcoin reaching the same level as cash. Several reasons:
1) It seems that bitcoins do not have a value of their own. Bitcoins are always compared to a USD value. Not that this is a problem, but it is a problem when it becomes a purely speculative currency. People mine bitcoins just to sell them or people buy/sell bitcoins just to make a USD profit.
2) The obtaining of bitcoins is a major problem. It imposes several limits. You have to either mine them, which is not feasible for the general public. Or you have to speculate on them (see  This is pretty useless as a bitcoin functions as a "middleman". And not as the currency it aims to be.  Why not pay directly in cash? 
3) The fact that major financial institutions are not backing them, might seem all fine and dandy in a conspiracy riddled world. But this implies that major corporations won't use bitcoins either. I wouldn't be able to go to walmart and buy a toothbrush for 5BTC. This greatly limits the use of bitcoins by the public affecting its popularity. 
 Not that I don't like the ideals behind bitcoin, I just don't think the public will see it as a viable option.
