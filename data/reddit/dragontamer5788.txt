Hashrate can only drop by 50% before you risk a 51% attack.
Its not like the mining equipment disappears. If one entity buys up all of that mining equipment, then they can start 51% attacking BTC.

The lower the hash-rate, the easier a 51% attack gets. Nothing changes this fundamental fact. This is how BTC was designed.
When the hashrate was 62 exa-hashes in August, you'd need 31 exahashes to get a 51% attack. Now the Hashrate is hovering around 30 exahashes, so you only need 15 exahashes to do a 51% attack.
EDIT: Got my big-units mixed up. Originally said Peta, I think the correct "big unit" is Exa though.

I'm not saying someone would do it. I'm saying someone could do it.
For months, btc bulls defended that the high hadheate, which many claimed was a waste of electricity, was performing useful work to defend the blockchain.
Now that the hashrate falls, it's apparently fine. Oh well

They're all Vegetables. They're from the planet Vegeta(ble).
Honestly, the creator was just really hungry when he came up with names. Beer(us) and Wis(key). Gohan (aka: Rice in Japanese).
Well, then there's that other family: Dr. Brief, Trunks, Bulma (bloomers with bad Japanese accent), and Bulma's sister "Tights".
