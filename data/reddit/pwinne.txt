sounds like FUD - or this a real threat to bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-01-29 09:44:00
i admit, im lost
@_date: 2018-01-29 09:32:09
THIS: is my concern also
@_date: 2018-01-17 04:34:44
 today
Q: (laughingly), so are you worried about losing everything?
A: fuck no, dropped 2K on the bargains
silence is golden.
@_date: 2018-01-29 09:48:47
I thought the detail (linked below) was not clickbait?
@_date: 2018-01-30 23:12:06
is tether a total pump and dump?
@_date: 2018-01-29 09:49:50
Well I hope so. Posted to hear people’s opinions
@_date: 2019-07-22 14:01:36
I love that it’s immutable. Humans can now trade goods for bitcoin without a 3rd party, law or corrupt government taking a cut or reversing the transaction.
TBH I think it will cause a huge shift is social norms away from banking institutions. It will be like decriminalising drugs, where banks are dealers and joe public is the addict.

well, I went bankrupt in 2013 after amassing a few million.. money gives you choices but not happiness.

He sounds like a total turncoat
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:53:15
No delete, now bankrupt! I still wish I could get my hands on more crypto!
@_date: 2017-12-19 01:53:42
Yep it was at the time about 1k AUD used BTCmarkets
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:15:36
TBH - just recently can out of bankruptcy, have 2 young kids and my wife (who is just separated with) passed away in October. I thinking of finding away of helping people like me with costs of raising kids etc.
@_date: 2017-12-04 01:25:04
I must remind myself that the so called investment gurus banking on bits of paper have the same opinion about bitcoin (crypto in general) as taxi drivers do about Uber!
@_date: 2017-12-04 02:31:39
thats a very good point. 
cypto has a very unknown future, I guess we all hope the music doesn't stop when we are holding
@_date: 2017-12-13 09:12:42
He should dollar cost average for awhile so he can ‘experience’ the highs and eventual lows of crypto before investing large amounts of money like that (unless of course 150 big ones is chump change)
Best of luck 
@_date: 2017-12-19 01:51:41
I have for AUD
@_date: 2017-12-04 01:46:53
I agree partly. I think crypto will change the world. Bitcoin may not take the lead in this, but something will. I guess my point is, like many things before us, cars after horses and the internet itself, it can take years for people to take notice and before they realise it, it has become second nature.
For example, I have 4 kids under 15 - THEY are follow the crypto space with interest; they may never stand in a bank queue!

Hey I’m OP and I dislike it! where do they get this shit!
@_date: 2017-08-24 00:53:06
hiding it from anyone!
@_date: 2017-08-24 00:52:39
I think you just described every central bank in every major country.
Having been bankrupt, I love the idea of decentralised economies.
@_date: 2017-08-23 00:13:05
litecoin for coffee

Everyday under my last buy price is a sale!
@_date: 2019-08-20 12:57:16
Let us not forget that New Zealand will allow people to be paid in bitcoin from 1st September.
@_date: 2019-08-12 00:17:28
So are you suggesting bitcoin will be a store of value or become meaningless?
@_date: 2019-08-15 05:56:27
another buy opportunity!
@_date: 2019-06-07 17:02:38
This year I’ve started using bitcoin more and more - particularly with online only services!
@_date: 2019-06-18 18:13:46
and gold was 40 bucks in 1971. yes it’s not moon level but it ain’t cheap either.

Hey excel added it as a currency!
@_date: 2019-06-14 15:22:02
That’s what I do with alts. My BTC, LTC is elsewhere
@_date: 2019-06-04 02:16:50
Lol - banks must be worried. Mine just advised me I couldn’t use their cards to buy bitcoin..
@_date: 2017-11-27 11:10:29
he has 3 testicles.. which one is actually the left one is the real dilemma
@_date: 2019-12-26 03:20:53
fuck I hope so

Australia, I pay bills with bitcoin all the time 
Edit - and I can buy gold with bitcoin here 
But I can’t sell gold for bitcoin
@_date: 2019-12-26 13:22:43
I care about adoption and price
@_date: 2019-12-26 02:59:25
I hoard both gold and BTC. More people accept bitcoin more than gold as a form of value exchange (well
@_date: 2019-12-26 03:02:20
It will be interesting to see the value of bitcoin and gold in 2030..
@_date: 2018-02-02 18:59:34
It’s not controlled by any central government. It will only die when people stop believing.
Like gold, it will hold value because somebody somewhere believes the FIAT currency model will one day fail.
@_date: 2018-02-06 02:20:33
crashed up, love it
@_date: 2019-09-26 07:47:59
I’d buy them all for 1k
@_date: 2019-09-26 07:51:18
I have gold and silver investments and it’s currently harder to ‘buy’ things with gold than it is bitcoin.
I do agree however that the amount of gold is limited to what the earth can offer and that won’t be changed. Everything else is open to corruption when us humans are involved!!
@_date: 2019-09-26 11:33:45
I agree - but does it account for manipulation
@_date: 2019-09-05 04:30:11
scroll down to first coinage -  [ 
people were using other items as currency long before the idea of a 'coin' was universally accepted by any nation state.
@_date: 2019-09-05 10:26:03
because since the idea of trading items for goods (or money) people have been lending with those items and charging a rate to do so.
@_date: 2019-09-26 13:06:58
I wish I had
