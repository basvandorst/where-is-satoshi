I think it's fine for an app to make money. Mycelium already had their marketplace that they took a cut from iirc. It's just that RMC (Russian Miner Coin) seemed shady as hell. Now it looks like they are partnered with a coin focused around Fantasy Sports which at least that appears to have an actual purpose/platform. I'm not the only one that was sketched out by them partnering with RMC.

Is this updated? I don't really trust any of the wallets on Android. I used to think Mycellium was the way to go until they started promoted RMC through the app

Intent. It is much easier to scan a qr code with the wrong amount than it is to physically write out a check incorrectly. 
If it wasn't intended to be sent and the person made an effort to avoid contact then no judge is gonna smile upon that person. I get a big part of btc is that the transactions are reversible but we also live in a society (with laws that can protect people when needed)

The person I replied to did not receive their coin back. And the phrase I used was just that, a phrase. And yes, it's true that you can't squeeze blood from a stone. But if it falls under the felony statue they could be criminally convicted and go to jail. So I would imagine they would be very much incentivized to come up with the money to drop the charges or come to a plea deal or w/e (not a lawyer)

Are you sure that due to the value stolen that it wouldn't be a felony? You'd have a longer statute of limitation in that case. Might be worth talking to a lawyer. Most will give a free consultation

Of course. If people weren't buying at the current price, it would keep dropping
