You can do whatever you want with the trophy after you get it m8. Still a win.

Hey man, if you don't want him dancing in the end zone, don't let him score a touchdown. Try again in 7 years.

That's what they said about bitcoin.

Wanna bet all your bitcoins on that? Nm you prob sold all yours during the last fork bc you have no faith in something that's amazing.

That's what they said about hodlers, but look at us now.

Trump is like the official mascot of bitcoin, an unassuming new contender shaking up banks and the establishment. Constantly criticized and down trodden, yet resilient and a champion of the people which it constantly rewards for their support. We may be hodling BTC but Trump is hodling our hearts. 
Edit: I triggered a lot of people, probably non hodlers. There's two things in this world that aren't done: Bitcoin and Drumpf.

"Bitcoin is done for!" "Bitcoin will never break $500" "Bitcoin will never break $4000" "You're delusional. I'd be very surprised if Bitcoin lasts two more months." Ok man...
RemindMe! 2 months

Hasn't every President won the election before? Wat? 
@_date: 2017-08-23 21:14:01
The election.

What are you talking about? I've been with BTC from day one. I was also with Trump since before the republican primary. All I'm saying is that Trump is being doubted like BTC is always being doubted. Both are going to be around for a long time and both are resilient. I can't believe people 1) still think BTC is on the verge of impeachment and 2) Trump isn't worth investing in. It's 2017 people, geez.

Despite your personal feelings, he really is like bitcoin, no matter how much CNN says he's a scam or he is part of a scheme... he keeps winning, he keeps inspiring more people, he keeps scaring the establishment. Just. Like. Bitcoin. Unstoppable and constantly winning. Same. Same.

Why is that?

I really couldn't care less, I'm not a criminal. Most the the data LE gets is from commercial sources that we volunteer freely. If someone is tracking how you're moving money, you're into some pretty bad shit with a lot of PC. However, looks like a cool service.
