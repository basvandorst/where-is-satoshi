The ONLY thing I can think of is that BFX would track the value of the token as it changed over time.  Then they would pledge to value it at the market level for US holders and pay out on demand after a certain time has passed or a certain threshold was met.  
  
But in doing so, it would disadvantage anyone in the US who wanted from accessing the tokens, and the original US holders would not be able to liquidate them to other buyers if desired, nor would they* have any impact on the market value.  
  
That seems like a larger shit-to-bread ratio for US people vs everyone else in this $70 million BFX shit sandwich.

What I meant was that due to the type of attack and the measures it required, I am assuming that there was some sort of negligence.

And such a thing will be forced upon them by all the people who lost a significant amount of BTC.  They will attempt to do so, and in the long run may succeed.  Or if BTC is declared money then there is a fiduciary duty.
  
If they end up going the insolvency/bankruptcy path then I believe the losses will end up being socialized.

Here is a thing.  I do not have any coins in this particular exchange.  So I have no financial interest in what happens.  However, **I** know the answer to this question.  The answer is that no one is going to be able to withdraw ANYTHING for now because: 
  
A) The site is down and all transactions are paused
  
B) NO DECISION has been made on how to move forward
  
I get that you are probably wanting to know what happened to your money.  BUT all you need to do is read less than a page of replies to this thread to know the answer.  I have seen this exact question probably over a hundred times.  How hard is it to read the thread?

I have no horse in this race since I had no BTC nor fiat in Bitfinex.  But...if say I did.  Say I had $1000 USD and 10 BTC (and some ETH for the heck of it) that were "unaffected".
  
Now that we know that the hack is in the order of 119K BTC (roughly $70 million), and assume this will kill Bitfinex...I would still stand to lose that money I would assume.  Because they are insolvent.
  
**If** (IF!) all of the above is true, what actually happens to the fiat and BTC in those "unaffected" accounts?  It has to go somewhere.  Would it redistributed to creditors in a bankruptcy settlement?

@_date: 2016-08-06 17:09:12
If they did that, they would be bankrupt.  If that were to happen, it would be worse for you because the same thing would happen except the loss would probably be more than 36% and it would take 5 years for you to see your money.
@_date: 2016-08-05 20:43:19
Too late, actually.
@_date: 2016-08-04 03:59:01
From my understanding of it (which may be wrong mind you), the reason is due to the fact that the entity will be declared insolvent if they cannot pay back all of the losses to the holders of the BTC.
  
Once they are declared so, then bankruptcy ensues and based on those laws, all assets are then distributed across all creditors - i.e. socialized loss.
@_date: 2016-08-10 19:25:54
Some of us think that BFX will come back and are willing to put money into that wager.  But apparently as an American citizen, I don't get to participate.  :/
@_date: 2016-08-03 03:27:30
After a loss of $60 to $70 million, I would assume at this point that any remaining BTC, ETH, ETC, LTC, USD, etc. would be unattainable and would be part of a redistribution to creditors during the ensuing bankruptcy.  I would assume that nothing now held by Bitfinex could be considered safe under any definition.
@_date: 2016-08-10 19:33:04


  
Is this a permanent scenario?  The release says "at this time".  Will there ever be a time/way that a US resident can BUY BFX Tokens?
@_date: 2016-08-07 04:43:12
Please provide evidence of this.  Either that or please stop spreading rumors.
@_date: 2016-08-04 04:31:49


I would disagree because Bitfinex was the caretaker of the coins and the coins were taken in such a way that the owners could not stop.  It bypassed 2FA and also Bitfinex's limits from BitGo.  There was nothing that the end customers could have done to stop the theft.  Again much of this opinion is based on that of people who claim more knowledge of this in the main Bitfinex hack thread.
  
Also if this IS the take that Bitfinex will put out...that it was the users that were hacked, there will absolutely be a shitton of people who will challenge this legally which will almost certainly put the whole mess into bankruptcy court.

@_date: 2016-08-04 04:43:45


Because of the nature of the hack.  It required 2 keys (one from Bitfinex and one from BitGo) as well as the authorization to remove the limits.  Not knowing how it was done of course makes this more of a conjecture than anything else, but one could conclude that such a hack could only have been pulled off as the result of extreme incompetence or negligence on the part Bitfinex.
@_date: 2016-08-06 17:06:35
Because if they don't then they will be sued into bankruptcy and EVERYONE will lose a LOT more, and it will take a LOT longer to get their money back.

I have a question.  Suppose I am the hacker and am now sitting on $60 million in BTC.  What in the name of Satoshi am I to do with it?  Surely I could not just cash it out for fiat somewhere could I?  Is it really that simple once they have it?  It would have to be tumbled I assume.  That has to take a while tumbling 120,000 coins.  What's SOP when stealing an assload of BTC?

A small amount is not a huge deal.  But when coins are on an exchange, you do not own them because you do not own the private keys.  What you have is an IOU for them from the exchange.  If anything happens to the exchange you might lose some or all of the coins.  This has happened several times.

Your price is the one when you press the Go button.  So even if it goes up before you receive the coins, you don't pay the higher price.

I would use something like Recuva to scan for deleted wallet.dat files.  If nothing then, it is possible he purchased but left them on the website in a wallet they provided access to.  In that case, shit is likely as gone as yesterday's breakfast.

No fucking way.  You fucking pushed it.
  
Yes Coinbase is legit.  And their [all time high listed for BCH]( was on Dec 20th, 2017 6:00 PM.  The price was $3346.83.
  
So, even the exchange that was *the source* of the technical glitch you are claiming is an actual price does not recognize that as the all time high.
  
Please use facts when talking about crypto.  We have enough of a hill to climb to get acceptance from the general public as it is.  We do not need bullshit being passed around as truth.
@_date: 2018-01-04 17:37:09
Blockchain.com is **not** a secure storage solution.  If you have enough value to make it worth the purchase now, or plan to in the future (i.e. you will continue to buy), a hardware wallet such as a Trezor or a Ledger is the best solution.  Otherwise, [a paper wallet]( is an acceptable alternative.
@_date: 2019-07-02 18:36:14


No.  I researched [BCH all time high]( and found it instead of quoting an erroneous price that some may have fraudulently taken advantage of.  Just because you want to think that a technical glitch was an actual price does not make it so, especially when literally *every single market in existence* recognizes that **fact**.
@_date: 2019-07-02 14:32:48
You ain't missing much.
@_date: 2019-07-02 18:26:57
So one (or maybe even a few) people got incredibly lucky and fraudulently sold some at $8500 just before Coinbase froze all BCH activity except for Order Cancels and you want to call that the all time high?  This is a great example of reverse FUD.

And the last time I checked, Bitcoin was actually a crypto currency.  So there's that.
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:27:02
But then as you said, the coin is locked on the paper wallet because of high fees.  Is segwit the only hope or do people expect the fees to move back to a reasonable level anytime soon?  I have similar plans with $50 and $100 paper wallets.
@_date: 2017-12-13 23:11:10
It a lot like the numbers at the bottom of your checks.  You have 2 numbers, one being the bank routing number that you can post no matter what.  All that tells someone is what bank you use.  The other number is your account number.  You don't post that publicly because that could lead to theft.
  
Your public key is similar to the bank routing number, except you can use it to accept payment of bitcoin there too.  The private key you NEVER give out.

Be sure to calculate any Capital Gains tax you will incur when you sell.  Paying off a 21K loan all at once will definitely get noticed and they WILL be watching for your taxes.  Maybe wait until after the new year to do it.  But there may be a sell off that will drop the price then as well.  Many things to consider.  But yeah getting out of debt will be good.  Take what you would normally pay for the debt and buy BTC with it after you are clear so you get back into the game.
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:39:55
You need to report it on your taxes as Capital Gains.  Depending on the amount, you may not have to pay, but you definitely need to look at it and report it.  The amount taxed would be the difference between buy and sell.  For example if you bought 1 coin at $100 and then sold it for $1000, the taxable amount would be the Capital Gain of $900.  [More info](
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:22:12

Or...you could set up a Zelle account to pay for your Bisq deposit and transactions.  Cool!  Oh wait.  Zelle requires what?  Let's check their site!
  


  
Oops.  There's that pesky KYC again.
  
OK, well Bisq *does* also support a long list of other payment options.  But they all require KYC (Chase QuickPay, National Bank Transfer and more), are risky (face to face fiat exchange), are very slow (US Postal Money Order), expensive to use (Western Union), difficult/limiting (again face to face fiat exchange), don't work in some geographical areas (Revolut, SEPA), or any combination of the above.

If you take out the CASH value, I would think no.  i.e. if you bought 1 BTC at $100 (ha) then later took out 0.1 when it was at $1000 per.  Because the cash amount is the same so IMO you would not owe tax.  But I am not a tax pro so do some [good research](

You'll get very few people to admit that you are correct because they are blinded from the current value of their wallet files.  Today's price is supposedly the culmination of the last few years of misery of up and down and crashes and Goxings and so on.
  
The fact is that a LOT of people have gotten into BTC of late solely because of the skyrocketing price climb.  They don't give a single shit about its use as a future currency and are just in it as an investment.  
  
IMO BTC has a long way to go before it can be used as a real currency.  There are still many many ties to illegal activities for it to be accepted as a societal norm.  And yes, I know that fiat is used a lot in the same way but BTC is new so it gets a lot of scrutiny.
  
Even if the price went to $500,000, I am not seeing a way that it could be folded in to our global economy until and unless technology gets way more integrated into our everyday lives.  10...20...25 years?  Who knows?

If you sell under the table they technically would not have any way to tell.  But then you are going to have to either launder the money (and then pay tax) or explain how you happened across this large windfall (and then pay tax).  Or just keep the cash in a box in your house and spend it out piecemeal (which has its own problems).

@_date: 2017-12-15 16:51:03
Cute little stories do not make for sound financial advice.  Educate yourself about the actual issue instead of making up tales that have no meaning other than a reference to a colloquialism.
  
When the story says "The Bitcoin will be the next monkey business", there is literally no evidence to support or deny this claim whatsoever.  I can play the same game:
  
       One day there was a man who discovered that monkeys can be trained to do work and are happy to do it as 
       well.  So he trained his monkeys to do so and also bought more monkeys anytime he saw one for sale.
  
       All the villagers laughed at him and said he would be broke in a year.  Well the training took a lot longer than 
       he thought because the monkeys could not talk to tell him what they needed to be happier.  But they did like 
       bananas as everyone knows so he gave them lots of those.
  
       Over time the monkeys got happier and did more work but once in a while they ended up throwing poop at 
       each other too.  Everyone laughed at the man when this happened and again told him that his monkeys would 
       destroy his life.  He just smiled and cleaned up the poop and bought more monkeys.
  
       Then one day he found a secret monkey book that told him how to speak the monkey language.  He read it 
       and asked the monkeys what they needed.  They said they wanted some beer as well as bananas.  So he got 
       them some beer.  The very next day, all the monkeys came to work drunk off their asses.  
       But as it turns out, a drunken monkey is an amazingly efficient worker.  No one had ever guessed that!
  
       So now the man had a huge factory filled with happy drunken monkeys who loved their work and did it    
       night and day.  The man ended up so rich that he bought everyone else's houses.  But he was really nice so 
       he was a landlord that did not hold a grudge against the morons who had laughed at him back in the day.
  
       But he still has a lot more money than them.

Coinbase is OK for relatively small amounts.  If you go bigger, get a hardware wallet...Trezor or Ledger.  Then you are completely secure as long as you keep your seed words in a safe safe safe safe location such as a bank deposit box.
  
The Trezor (and presumably the Ledger) could get stolen, lost, dropped into the ocean, run over by a car or whatever and you are fine.  Just get another one and regain access with the seed words.
  
If/when you want to sell, move coins from the hardware to an exchange first, then do whatever.  But for a long term hodl, nothing beats a secure hardware wallet.

This entire thread is the perfect reason why BTC is not ready for prime time as a standard currency.  All the sovcit types trying to hide everything because 'taxation is theft' or some other such nonsense.  Build roads by using the blockchain as a decider as to where they go and have the local businesses pay for them?  What a complete clusterfuck of an idea that is.  'Why has there been a 388% increase in car accidents in the last 6 months?'  'Well maybe it is because we all voted to make Main St. shaped like a dickbutt just for the LOLs'  'Naw that couldn't be it, there has to be a better reason.'
  
Oooooo wait I know...we'll all stop using the internet to buy and store our coins.  Yeah.  We'll use Meetup to find other like minded and woke people to buy and sell coins that way.  I'm SURE that will work out just fine.  And we won't ever have to pay taxes again!  See you at the library!  Be sure to bring your Trezors!
  
We all live in the real world kids, like it or not.  The real world has governments, like it or not.  The real world government has taxes for a reason (and its not 'theft'), like it or not.  When you cash out your coins, you'll need to pay Capital Gains taxes, like it or not.  Now more than ever because of how well BTC is doing.  If it stayed down below $1,000 no one would give a shit about your Capital Gains.  But that's the rub, eh?  Get rich with BTC...pay your taxes.  Try and hide that shit...have fun.
  
And here's a helpful hint: if BTC ever DOES become a globally accepted currency that replaces fiat, do you actually think you won't need to pay taxes on it?  If so, I've got a great bridge to sell you for only 3.8 BTC...hit me up.
  
There's a reason that the phrase 'Death and taxes' is a thing.

@_date: 2019-07-28 20:09:49
Assuming you are in the USA, yes, it is the same as cashing out.  So you do you get hit with capital gains.  This holds true if:
  
1. You sell BTC for cash
2. You buy goods or service with BTC
3. You exchange BTC for some other cryptocurrency
  
Basically, unless you are 100% hodling, you will be subject to capital gains.  But only on the portion of BTC that you used.  So if you buy $100 worth of BTC but then then buy coffee for $3.00 worth of BTC, the capital gains is only calculated against the $3.00.  But it also works in reverse, i.e. you could realize a loss that you can claim against depending on what the price was when you bought vs. what it was when you used it.

I thought I saw some discussion on how this will affect the value of pre-block increase coins as opposed to post-block increase coins.  This explanation makes it seem like this would not affect values at all.  Did I miss something or am referring to something else?  If the values WILL be different, why and how?
@_date: 2018-09-11 13:07:04
Yep.  You're right.  You never mentioned doing anything illegal.  But you literally asked for advice on how to move coins around so you can buy on the darknet in an untraced manner.
  
Not everything on the darknet is illegal.  But 99% of it is.  So would you care to share what it was that you were going to buy from the darknet that is so totally not illegal?
  
Using BTC to do illegal shit undermines it use as a legitimate alternative to fiat.  It scares away potential new users and businesses from seeing it as what Satoshi originally wanted.
  
So do your nudge nudge wink wink bullshit elsewhere.
  
EDIT: And you complaining that your post history doesn't imply you are buying illegal items with BTC is laughable.  You literally posted [a photo you took]( of three large nuggets of weed to @_date: 2017-12-14 19:38:35

One problem is that a lot of people who use bitcoin use it for nefarious purposes such as buying things from the Dark Net.    That leaves a stain on it from the perspective of someone who is new.  BTC won't ever replace currency until and unless it moves away from shady anonymous uses.  I see it a lot...people here posting about how you should "Fuck Coinbase" because of its strict rules.  What many of those people really mean is that they want to keep on being able to buy dope without getting caught.  That stigma is going to forever keep BTC in the dank alleyways of business.
  
And yes, spin driven swings.  Some whales get a hot itch up their ass and we all go crazy scratching.  Price goes up for a couple weeks, then dives again.  Rinse.  Repeat.  For seemingly no reason whatsoever, the price will shift $10 or more in a day.  Or an hour.  Whatever.
  
But really.  The day is **coming**!  Soon BTC will take over and we'll all be rich!  Because my God, just yesterday some idiot who declared himself a micronation said that BTC is his "country's" official currency.  Yeah.  That's gonna drive Wall St. directly to crypto overnight.

Ha!  Yep I got the same email about 4 weeks after I signed up and had decided to move on from them.  Very glad of that.

The purpose of Bitcoin is to grow into a new form of wealth used by a significant portion of the finance world in order to transcend the current constraints that hold the average person back from improving their place in life.
  
The purpose of Bitcoin is **NOT** so little kiddies can go buy drugs and fake IDs from the darknet without getting into trouble.
  
Bitcoin DOES need to lose a few use cases.  ANY use case that involves illegal goings on.  Period.  Because unless and until it does it will remain nothing more than fucking electronic Monopoly money that no one takes seriously.  Its time to grow up and join the real world.
@_date: 2015-01-29 22:54:04
So sorry that we do not decide to use our money in the same way as you do and thus disappoint you.  I shall herein not make a single financial decision in my life without your prior consent.  Please let me know ASAP how much I should spend on my groceries this week.  Also should I buy some stocks as well?  Which ones?
@_date: 2015-01-29 23:22:33
Sorry, you're just not worth the effort anymore.
@_date: 2015-05-06 18:34:43
Oh no it totally adds up.  He just likes to send money to DNM for no reason other than pure altruism.  Because they do good work and all.
@_date: 2015-01-27 19:26:06
Derp.  But thanks for the tip anyway!  :)
@_date: 2015-05-06 01:57:43
Just tired in general of people complaining about every aspect of Coinbase.  I think those that are so inclined get the idea.  Dead horse and all.
@_date: 2015-01-28 21:19:45
OP should buy anyone who posts here 0.1 BTC.  That way the number of BTC users increases, which under his theory would only make the rise come sooner.  I stand ready and willing to accept your risk sir.
@_date: 2016-01-23 20:34:30
This sounds like a double your money scam.  I assume you mean that when you spend some from A, it would decrement from B as well the proper amount.  
  
Or that you put 1/2 in each to start with.
@_date: 2017-03-17 00:34:14
Cannot get in.
@_date: 2015-05-12 17:16:16
Thank you!
@_date: 2017-02-01 05:06:31
REALLY?!  OMG!  It is almost as if you post the same scam bullshit every fuking day!
@_date: 2017-03-07 05:26:40
A) Never buy BTC with money you cannot afford to lose
  
B) If the price goes down, wait.  Buy more if you can afford it (see Rule 1)
  
C) Holding is better long term.  If you are trying to invest for a quick profit in fiat, that will probably work out poorly for you.
@_date: 2017-03-02 02:48:28
It has been 30 minutes so far.  Was that your experience?
@_date: 2019-11-16 02:32:00
Yes the Blockchain Wallet ID login.  I have a list of mental passwords that I use so I could spend time working on that but I don't want to bother unless there are actual coins there.  So I want to check the balance with just that Wallet ID.
@_date: 2019-03-28 17:39:45


I would consider that Bisq is not as safe as some would claim.
@_date: 2019-11-21 16:04:08


  
Cannot reverse it.  Check your sent address and see if it received the coins on the blockchain.
@_date: 2019-11-16 16:22:56
I am not at the point of recovering yet.  All I want to do is see the balance.  If it is significant then I will pursue recovery.
@_date: 2019-03-28 15:19:22


  


  


  
You get to pick two of these.  Well not 1 &amp; 3.  And 1 &amp; 2 is gonna be a crap shoot.
@_date: 2016-06-23 21:02:59
You'll thank me come Monday.  Trust me.
@_date: 2019-11-16 07:31:56
I almost certainly did not.  How would I go about doing that?
@_date: 2019-03-26 21:36:36
Yep.  Sign me right up.  I'll take all my BTCs that I have bought over the last several years and toss it into this new startup that I never heard of because they can PROMISE a 9% return over the next 3 to 36 months even though literally no one in the world can predict what the price per bitcoin will be in the 24 hours.
  
Totally does not sound like a scam and you totally do not sound like a shill account for these crooks because hell your Reddit account is already TWO WEEKS old.  Damn nigga, that's some straight up fire you got there.
  
Let me send you all my coins.  Hit me up with an address in DM.  I'll get back to you immediately.
@_date: 2016-06-24 21:49:15
You are far far too late.  Use the money you want to buy a miner with to buy bitcoins instead.
@_date: 2019-11-16 16:38:34
People like you are the reason why we see new comers complaining about being afraid to ask questions.  One of the reasons why they get into crypto and then right back out.  Too  many assholes who can't be bothered to help without a condescending 'Fuck you newbie' attitude.  Let me ask you this - why would you even bother to reply like a dick?  Why not chuckle to yourself, mumble something idiotic then move on without posting?  Are you so addicted to the twenty upvotes from your fellow fucktards that you're willing to help make this sub a place that people who want to learn avoid?
@_date: 2019-03-01 22:27:26
Your coins are gone forever.  But you learned a lesson in scamology.
@_date: 2019-11-16 15:59:18
See this is a perfect example of the asshole gatekeeping that happens in this sub.  I've been buying crypto for years and storing it on my Trezor.  But back in 2013 when the wallet in question was made, I was a beginner and Trezor was just a concept.  So maybe go fuck yourself and try to be nicer to people who post genuine questions in the sub.
@_date: 2018-10-24 18:56:48

@_date: 2017-08-31 13:20:28
Really?  A 12 year old in a poor country posted [this](
@_date: 2016-06-23 20:29:35
Ummmm....sure.  The price will continue to drop for the next three days.  On Sunday at approximately 3:47 PM EST, it will reach the bottom and then begin an upward trend again for at least 2 more weeks.  Best to buy just before then of course.
@_date: 2016-06-18 17:54:54
Do not mine.  You will not ever make a profit.  It will actually be a loss.  Only do it if you are interested in the process.  If you want to make money, just buy BTC instead.
@_date: 2019-11-28 02:07:26
Instructions unclear; Bitcoin stuck in dick.  Please advise.
@_date: 2018-10-11 16:08:21

@_date: 2017-08-10 21:05:04


  
@_date: 2017-01-04 18:05:55
Do not pay him a single dollar.  He is trying to scam you, is very misinformed, or is being scammed by someone else.  If you want BTC, just buy it directly.
@_date: 2018-10-29 17:58:18
An obvious exit scam.  Never keep coins on any exchange, period.
@_date: 2018-10-11 01:20:12
It is the pre-Holiday Dip.  Happens every single year like clockwork.  Don't worry, come December 27th, it will be at $18,000+ guaranteed.
@_date: 2018-10-11 17:40:53
I think you know where you can put your options.  All guarantees relating to BTC are like assholes.  Everyone has one and they all stink.
@_date: 2018-10-24 18:23:21
Well, I mean, you can give them to *me* of course.  I am 100% trustworthy.
@_date: 2018-10-24 16:56:35
Never give out private keys in any form, period.
@_date: 2018-10-11 18:01:55
I fully recall making that statement.  Everything I have said so far still stands.
@_date: 2017-01-13 04:29:28
Again.  No explanation as to what makes it 'bad' other than 'generally considered'.  
@_date: 2017-08-01 17:24:26

It could *go either way* and the Nikkei is a perfect example.  So is Microsoft's stock history.
  
The fact is that not you, not me, not OP, not any fucking person on earth can say with any certainty whatsoever what the price will be in a day.  Or a week.  Or a year.
  
So to all you folks saying it will crash crash crash...eat shit.
  
And to all you 10k folks...eat shit.
  
You are making a bet when you buy or sell them, period.  Gambling.  Nothing more, nothing less.
  
If you have more money than faith in BTC, then sell them when they are as high as you think they will go and reap your rewards.
  
If you have more faith in BTC than money, then buy the shit out of them and hope for the best.  
  
Anything else is pure unadulterated bullshit.
@_date: 2017-08-15 14:09:35
This is fuking beautiful.  I would ask what you guys plan on having in your registry but I guess I'll just buy you some crypto.  Is Doge acceptable or do you want BCH?
@_date: 2017-08-08 03:07:29


And so far no one has.  Your address has a zero balance last time I looked.  PM me the address again so I can see it.
@_date: 2018-10-25 17:11:59
Fantastic.  Just to let you know, this pump won't be as big as the previous ones because shit is being saved up for the Christmas Blast.  Only between $2200 - 3000 in price rise over the next 6 days.  Then it will drop again by $1700 or so until the second week in December.  But watch out then!  Huge...and I mean HUGE gains are on deck for that one.
@_date: 2017-01-07 18:27:22
Because there are so many 10k fanboys who insist that they'll all be [Stinking Rich]( in ten years no matter what.  Or people who should probably be posting in instead insisting that anyone who invests in BTC are going to be [living in a van down by the river]( no matter what.
  
And both sides are adamant that they are absolutely right 100% because reasons and anyone who disagrees is an idiot.  The fact is that they have no idea but are too far up their own asses jerking themselves off to admit it.
@_date: 2017-08-10 01:34:19
@_date: 2018-10-11 14:55:46
I buy BTC every week on an automated purchase.  
@_date: 2017-01-06 04:30:20
They have no idea.  It is pure conjecture with a healthy dose of naïve optimism thrown in.
@_date: 2016-11-07 21:33:52
  
EDIT: So.  Are you going bankrupt now?
@_date: 2017-08-08 00:47:01
So let me get this straight - you want us to send you $34.00 (rough market value) in hopes of you actually holding a real raffle and giving away 5 BTC?  Entirely based on your Reddit reputation of 2 days and 1 post karma?
  
Yeah.  Count me in.  (not really)
@_date: 2017-01-13 04:22:25
This does not explain WHY they are a 'bad wallet'.  It merely details the potential risk of losing money.
@_date: 2017-08-03 17:12:49
A lot of people got Goxxed and then it took a shit for a while.
@_date: 2017-08-08 00:58:40
It is not a typo.  The 8 makes it the largest prime number that can also be a Reddit username.
@_date: 2017-08-08 04:11:47
That's not the deal.  You are the one with something to prove, not me.  If you send the coin, that will prove it to me and I will do everything I say and even document it.  Anything else is just you blowing smoke up our asses.
@_date: 2017-08-31 23:58:12
I use mine to store because I only hodl.
@_date: 2017-08-14 22:28:52
If you are going to buy that much and hodl, you really need to invest a measly $100 or so in a Trezor or Ledger.  Keep your coins in your own hard wallet, not on an exchange.  If you keep on Coinbase, you don't own them.  You own an IOU for them.  If they have problems, YOU have problems.
@_date: 2016-11-23 18:29:28
This seems outside of even the regulated KYC stuff.  I have a bank account for cash and they don't ask what I will be spending it on or where I got it.  
  
Yes they know my employer and I have direct deposit but if I make a cash withdrawal or a cash deposit under $5000 I do not get asked these questions.
@_date: 2017-08-31 20:54:03
Buy at exactly 3:58 PM Greenwich Time tomorrow.
@_date: 2017-08-09 21:37:55
@_date: 2016-06-13 17:51:58
Hold until it crashes back down to $50.  So next Thursday or so.
@_date: 2018-06-14 22:45:54
Sure.  I don't actually have a spare aircraft hanger full of ASICs.  So I'll just mine with my 4 year old laptop.
  
WTF with you OP?  Are you at this exact time, high?
@_date: 2017-08-08 03:25:13
Here is a thing:
  
You claim to have made more than a lifetime of money in coins.  Great.  So now you are claiming you will giveaway approximately $17,000 just to make people 'more aware' of crypto.  OK.
  
But you want us to believe you.
  
So I have a deal for you: send me 0.1 BTC.  If you do, not only will I believe you, but I will actively lobby on your behalf, and the behalf of your raffle.  I'll even take off of work tomorrow to do so.  All for the price of two one-hundredths of what you claim you are going to giveaway for nothing.
  
You can send the 0.1 BTC here: 19Cwiw81597kZkDmQKhEbT2o5eNbG1DiwX
  
So this is all you need to do to **PROVE** you are a legit rich guy just trying to help spread the word of crypto.  Easy peasy.
@_date: 2018-06-11 23:45:19
Buying into BTC because you'll 'get rich cuz it will never go back down' is a very foolish attitude.  Dips are part and parcel to Bitcoin.  If you are afraid of dips then it is not for you.
@_date: 2019-08-27 17:24:36
BTC price of $500?  In what time frame?  Care to make a bet on this supposed fact that you so expertly predict?
@_date: 2018-06-08 20:01:58
Not if they don't know how to write and/or implement it.
@_date: 2019-08-20 22:45:55
OMG just hodl.  It would not be worth you time to sell it.
@_date: 2018-06-11 14:13:47
Tonight we dine in Hell!
@_date: 2019-08-27 21:06:34
Perhaps Anon is an enormous whale just getting his ducks in a row to manipulate the market to hit this prediction.  I mean think of the sweet sweet karma that will be reaped if this comes true.
@_date: 2019-08-06 00:13:10
How much do you want to sell?
@_date: 2019-08-10 18:19:07
If you can flip it to BTC I would buy it.
@_date: 2019-08-14 04:41:10
Yes.  Er, I mean no.
@_date: 2019-08-10 18:13:56
How much ether?
@_date: 2019-08-20 22:50:58
Literally the perfect reason to hodl.  Just keep your private key.
@_date: 2019-10-16 00:51:27
Ah.  So you have to join with an account and then install their app.  Even moreso am I out.  When something is free (ESPECIALLY money), you are the product, not the consumer.  And I plain do not believe that they are just handing out thousands of dollars for the fuck of it.
@_date: 2019-10-06 23:34:25


Good lord, I did not know this.  I would never ever use such a service.  What of value are they providing to the user that would entice them buy bitcoins for Robinhood?  Is it really true that you can only get the value of your coins by selling them?  You can't send them to an outside address?
@_date: 2018-06-11 14:13:34
OMG I wish I had bought in the $Vegeta days.  Hell I'd be happy to have bought in the $100 days.
@_date: 2019-08-20 22:42:30
How much BTC?
@_date: 2017-08-31 23:48:39
Get a Trezor or Ledger
@_date: 2019-08-10 18:09:20
How much BTC (not the value), and how is it stored?  Coinbase?  Paper wallet?
@_date: 2018-06-11 13:11:11
You do realize that it used to be $500.00 right?  Even less actually.
@_date: 2019-08-10 18:15:54
ETH or ETC
@_date: 2019-08-06 00:19:00
I'll give you $45.00
@_date: 2019-08-27 18:35:47


Oh my mistake.  You obviously have no source for your prediction.  But again, would you like to wager on the price in one year?
@_date: 2019-08-28 20:28:11
Are you kidding me?  I want sub ONE thousand prices.  I'd buy more entire coins rather than the fucking fractions I am getting now.
@_date: 2019-08-06 00:24:15
That fact does not change my offer.
@_date: 2019-10-06 23:40:18
Idiot.  You are wrong.  It will be the Tuesday after that.  Don't spread FUD.
@_date: 2019-10-07 01:56:57
You dipshit.  Everyone knows bull runs are just bear precursors.  Real growth is on Thursdays.
@_date: 2019-10-16 00:29:21


  
They generate their cash by getting mopes to buy into a non-regulated gamble and then not paying whomever wins.  Simple.
  
Then they get others to spam the Bitcoin sub in hopes of scrounging some more naive people to hand over money for nothing.
@_date: 2019-10-10 12:05:27
Probably not because Paypal accounts are tied to your bank account.  If you withdraw it, it will hit the bank first.
  
But here is a thing: if your bank account is overdrawn, buying crypto should be lower on your list of things to be doing.
@_date: 2019-08-10 21:11:14
I've bought BTC from others here and I have been in this community for a long time and on Reddit as well.  I know none of that is definitive but it is what I have.  I can look for the person I bought from before to use as a reference if you want.
@_date: 2019-10-10 12:13:01
That would require Coinbase to accept Paypal payments, which I am pretty sure is not a thing.  If a vendor does not accept Paypal, the only way to get your money out is to send it via your bank.  That takes about 3 days from my experience.  That is also why I always keep a zero balance on Paypal.  As soon as any money hits it, I immediately send it to my bank.  Why should they be getting the interest on the money when I can?
  
I suppose you could also send it to a person who would then pay you cash but that would not help with getting it to Coinbase.
@_date: 2019-08-28 20:25:53
Hoping for sub $5000!
@_date: 2019-10-07 01:56:00


And its also possible they tell everyone to go fuck themselves and thanks for all the bitcoins.  Wow.  No thanks, I'll keep my keys.
@_date: 2019-10-15 15:12:06


  
RemindMe for the post in six months when you have lost your coins due to a silly mistake.
  
Look, if you are going to invest cash into BTC, you owe it to yourself to educate yourself on how to do it.  Do NOT just buy in because it seems cool.
  
Having said that, if you are looking to own more than a hundred dollars USD worth of BTC, I would suggest a hardware wallet like Trezor or Ledger.  Take the time to actually read their site thoroughly.
@_date: 2019-10-07 03:48:36
I am hoping for sub $1000
@_date: 2019-10-15 18:12:17
Ahem.  I hope this is not in terms of someone demanding money or you will go to jail or to decrypt a hard drive you have.
  
Also it takes time to set up a Coinbase account and there are fees to send (but not huge).
@_date: 2019-10-03 20:03:03


After some time passes and they decide how they are going to apply a haircut to the users or you have to submit some paperwork and dive through red tape and blah blah blah.
  
Having your private keys on a Trezor or Ledger is absolute insurance against any exchange hack or inside job anywhere, period.  Not your keys, not your coins.  Do not be led into a sense of false security with any guarantee or insurance claim.  When (not if) the hack or crash or exit scam or whatever comes, do you want to be chasing after a long drawn out process trying to get your coins back (Sorry, all withdraws are disabled for the next 3-4 days), or do you want to login into your Trezor and see your balance 100% safe?
@_date: 2019-10-17 12:03:06
Fuck it, bring me back to the old $500.00 days.

The bottom has fallen out of bitcoin.  Sell all your coins ASAP.
@_date: 2016-11-23 22:49:07
But when I take money out of my bank, they don't ask me why.  Nor do they care where any cash deposits came from as long as it is less than $5000.00.  Providing my SSN will not change that.
@_date: 2019-06-10 19:34:16
I may be out of the loop here, but when where and how were paper wallets compromised?  How is it that ALL paper wallets regardless of source were affected?

Roofies for ants at only $7.00 each?!  Sign me up!
@_date: 2019-02-05 04:34:35
One reason is because there is still a lot of usage of it in dark markets.  That has a stigma to it that an average business guy might not want to touch with a ten foot pole.  Yes dollars are used way more for worse things but they've been around forever.  If some mope consumer sees my store takes those new weird bitcoins that the drug dealers use, then shit...I might not want to deal with him.
  
Also the volatility.  Why would I as a small businessman want to jump in with a form of payment that can shift so quickly?  The 0.1 BTC I took in yesterday was worth $350 roughly.  Tomorrow it might be worth $400 or $200, but I am still out the widgets I sold.

@_date: 2019-06-26 16:49:41
After 21K, the price will rise to a new ATH of $22,877.98.  Then there will be a slow descent over the course of two months to $641.34.  After that, things look a little murky, so ask again in September.

Indeed there is.  And if such a website were regulated by a set of laws or rules, you might have a viable claim against them.  As it is, they are not, because they are not a casino (nor even a legitimate business), and as such are not bound by any such rules.  Helpful hint: BTC faucets and gambling sites are useless wastes of your time at best and will separate you from your coin at worst with no recourse to you whatsoever.  Take this as a relatively cheap learning experience.  No one on earth will ever go to the trouble and expense to set up a website just so they can fuking hand out free money to random mopes.  Such sites ONLY exist to make money.  Period.

You might be.  You might not be.  Don't ever assume it will always go up.  It WILL go down at times.  Never invest more than you can afford to set on fire and watch burn.  You said you are new so here is a thing: Bitcoin is NOT free magic internet money that will make you rich in a week.  If you want to buy today but are worried about not being able to sell in the next 10 days, then maybe this isn't for you.  With fees and such, it is not likely that you are going to be making a worthwhile profit in that amount of time.

Not if it were viewed as a gift.  Then the tax would be incumbent on the giver.  But it could also be viewed as a prize, and therefore, income.  
  
Both things require no action from you to gain the BCH.  But really it is neither a gift nor a prize.  Not sure what that is called.  I am not sure that 'free air dropped money' was ever thought of as a potential thing by the IRS.
@_date: 2017-11-06 20:38:46
You would pay the tax because you gave a gift.  The same tax rate would apply as in the first example.  The receiver would not pay tax because they received a gift and immediately used it at the current face value.
  
As to it being unreasonable, you bought the coin when it was worth $100 and used it when it was worth $500.  That is a capital gain, ergo, is taxed as such.  If you don't want to pay tax on each and every BTC transaction then don't use it to buy things.

Financial investment is not the same as scientific endeavors.  If that were the case, then all scientists would be the richest people in the world.

I know.  Think about it from a physically possible perspective.  Man cannot fly.  Machines are made of metal and are very heavy.  There is no way we can create a metal machine that can fly.  Or go to the moon.  Or go to the bottom of the ocean.
  
My point is that 100 years ago, the things we do now were literally science fiction and absolutely impossible because we did not have the understanding to achieve them.  In 50 years from now, what will hold true in that regard?  When I was in 2nd grade, my teacher told me we'd never see individual atoms because that was 'impossible'.  We've now used individual atoms to [spell words out]( for fun, and just to show we can.  Never use the word 'impossible'.

So as I said I wanted to see the sent from and received to transaction.  It has happened in the past that people have put in the wrong 'to' address and the coins went to a wallet that they were not expecting.  Just trying to be helpful.  If you are sending 2.19 coins in a single transaction you should definitely be keeping the record of the coin's movements I would think.  But whatever.  Maybe cex will get back to you soon.  Good luck.

With Coinbase, $50.00 nets a $2.00 fee, at least for me.  The amount is whatever amount you are comfortable watching burn as you set it on fire.  i.e. no more than you can afford to lose.  The price changes a lot so weekly would allow you to hit lows better.

I use the word 'could' because literally no one in the world can say one way or the other what the price will be in a year.  It COULD be $12,000, but it also COULD be $500.  There is no data to provide because crypto has no backing of physical assets.  Its value is 100% based on what the majority of people are willing to pay for it.
  
You say I have no data.  Yet the only data you have provided is past performance.  That is a horrible basis upon which to build an investment portfolio.  Let's say this again, because it is REALLY important: HISTORICAL DATA CANNOT BE USED TO PREDICT FUTURE PERFORMANCE.  If you do this, you absolutely will regret it.

I have no one that needs babysitting, my kids are all grown.  I mow my own lawn.  I shovel my own walk.  Very very little of what I do is even on the scope of Bitcoin.  My local grocery store is not about to start taking it even if I ask the manager because it is a nationwide chain and they do what they are told from on high.  Same goes for most of the local restaurants I frequent.  And the few that I do go to that are not chains are small time mom and pops.  They are not about to delve into something that they know nothing about when they can just say "Cash or CC only".
  
Sure it would be nice if BTC were universally recognized and accepted but we are not there yet.  BTC is still seen as weird, secret, complicated, risky, and tied to the criminal underworld...and guess what?  All of those assumptions are actually still true.  Make one mistake and all your coins disappear in a puff of logic.  Or find out that the coins you accepted as payment two weeks ago have a back chain that ends up being tied to something like the Tether theft and now they aren't accepted...potentially anywhere.
  
And as others have said, why would I want to buy something for 0.01 BTC that is worth $100 today when tomorrow it could be worth $120?  And on the same token, why would my locally owned Chinese Buffet want to accept a payment for $30 in BTC when tomorrow it could be worth $20?  Small businesses live and die on incredibly thin profit margins.  Having to wait until BTC (maybe) goes back up above what I charge in fiat in order to pay my bills in not a viable business plan.  That isn't even considering the costs and transaction time of moving the coin from one wallet to the next.  I find it interesting that BTC promised "instant and virtually free transactions", yet most of the complaints in this sub (that are not about outright theft of coins) are about those exact issues being the opposite.
  
Bitcoin was created in 1492 by Columbus.  Right now, we are all European countries in say...1620.  We need to get to the 20th century before BTC will be seen as a universal currency.

You can't claim you acquired them when you gained control of the BTC keys because they literally did not exist as an entity at that time.  If you spent that blockchain, you would have been spending the BTC.  Before the split there was no BCH to cash out or spend.
  
Also you would owe tax on the gains when cashed out, not the original value.  Thus the $500.

If I ran across that much coin, I would put 99% of it on the Trezor and the rest in the bank.  Then live life the same for while and cash out when it grew to something I could live off of for the rest of however long I had.  You put $600,000 into the bank and you'll lose a huge chunk of it immediately from taxes and then probably blow the rest on shit you don't need and end up with nothing to show for it.

For I knew not that such a place wouldst give me money for free and then actually not give me money for free but engineer a way that looks like they are giving me money for free when in fact they are taking money from me if I use their so-called 'services' that claim to give me money for free for any length of time; such a thing smacks of someone setting up some shitty casino looking website whilst at the same time operating a way to get people to give them money for free because they are not restricted by any gambling laws or regulations because they are in fact, not an actual casino but forsooth a sham website designed to look like they are giving me money for free when in fact that are taking money from people who utilize it for any considerable length of time.

BTC will very likely not hit $500,000 in the next 3 years.  Neither will McAfee eat his own dick when it doesn't.
  
So don't get your hopes up for either event.  Now I am not a naysayer, I'd be really happy if it did reach that even in the next 10 years.  But I'd also be really surprised.
  
Of course I also said that $10,000 was a pipe dream and look where we are now.  So I may be full of shit.
  
But yeah, McAfee ain't never going to follow through on that statement if and when it comes to pass.
@_date: 2017-11-09 18:22:33
Does Coinbase not allow this?  I knew they blocked Hawaii but not NY.  Is that a thing too?
@_date: 2017-11-02 02:32:45
I have enough BTC to go to Zimbabwe and back several times and there's no way in fuck I am getting rid of any it for any quick profit in fiat.  Just my advice, take it or leave it.
@_date: 2017-11-17 20:07:47
Do any of his?  Or yours?  Or anyone's?  In the end BTC and all cryptos are not based on any physical object whatsoever.  Which makes them ultimately valued ONLY based on what a group of people agree that they should be valued at.  And that means truly that it is valueless.  Because at any moment, all that could turn to shit.
  
Look, I am not a BTC hater.  I own multiple whole coins, am invested in many altcoins and I also mine one.  I have a recurring buy order for BTC on Coinbase.  But I also recognize that crytpo is, in one way, an Emperor With No Clothes.  That is the core of the phrase 'Never invest more than you can afford to set on fire'.
  
McAfee is a loudmouthed attention seeking blowhard who squandered an enormous business and all the opportunity and potential that came with it and ended up living as a paranoid recluse on a South American farm.  And possibly had a hand in a murder or two (yes, really).  So don't take everything he says quite so seriously, and DEFINITELY don't take anything he says (or that I say for that matter) as serious financial advice.
@_date: 2017-11-04 20:15:34
Are you trying to mine for a profit?  If so, just use that money to buy BTC directly instead.
@_date: 2017-11-26 15:56:07
Don't mine BTC.  Use your money to buy it.  You cannot make a profit mining unless you literally have an aircraft hanger full of ASICs and cheap to nearly free electricity.

@_date: 2017-11-17 04:23:08
I am not a tax professional but it seems as though trading BCH for BTC would be a tax event.  When you first got the BCH, opening price was in the $700 range.  Let's pretend you traded them out at $1200 for BTC.  That would mean that you had a value increase in BCH of $500.  It is irrelevant what you purchased with the BCH...could have been beer, BTC, or blue paint.  So I think you would have a tax liability on the $500 increase in price.  
  
NOTE: USA only.
@_date: 2017-11-02 01:36:11
Yes I know what 2x means.  claimed you would "double your money".
@_date: 2017-11-02 04:44:22
I am not a financial adviser so I am not recommending that you buy BCH or not.  I just told you it is definitely possible and one way you could do it if you are so inclined.  However, I might be interested in buying your BTC should you choose to sell it.

This is where your argument fails.  OP was banned outright.  There is no 'asking for proof'.  Just 'fuck you, you're out'.  This is not a court of law, it is business where they can do what they want and you don't have to like it but you won't be doing business with them if they don't want you to.

It is actually true.  From [Bitcoin Tax FAQs](
  
        Jurisdiction
  
        All US citizens and residents are subject to a worldwide income tax. 
        This means that where ever money is earned, what ever currency, it is taxable.
  
        Any gains made from selling Bitcoins within any exchange are taxable
        Any gains made from selling Bitcoins to any individual are taxable.
        Any income of products or services purchased with Bitcoins are taxable.
  
As an example, if you buy BTC for $100 and then an amount of time later, buy a pizza in Italy for $10 (0.02 BTC) with the BTC that is now worth $500, you owe capital gains tax on what BTC was "sold" for when you made the purchase.  It is converted to monetary value in order to calculate the tax.  The tax is $10.00 - ($100 * 0.02) = $8.00.
@_date: 2017-04-05 17:25:54
No.  It is not viable.  It is only viable if you have:
  
1. An empty airplane hanger sized building (literally)
2. ASICs devoted to mining to fill said building
3. Virtually free electricity
  
Anything else and you will lose money, not earn it.
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:27:56
That may be true but I would own more coins.  As would a lot of others.

What address did you intend to send it to?
@_date: 2018-11-07 22:15:12
I mean yes.  But that scam only works because fiat payments take time to confirm.  If he sent you 0.9 BTC...you have it once confirmed.  There is literally nothing to stop you from just ignoring the guy from there on out.
  
If he never asks for the private key, then I cannot see how this would work as a scam.

This is roughly the equivalent of someone taking 10,000 $1 bills, taping them together to form a canvas, and then drawing a dirty picture on the canvas.  Then they take the dollar bills apart and go spend them in various places.
  
Now someone comes along and complains about the dirty picture being on money and how we should hold banks responsible for them.
  
But you only get to see the dirty picture if you assemble all the bills and put them together in the right way.

Order a Trezor or Ledger.  
  
Open account on Coinbase.
  
Buy coins.
  
When hardware wallet arrives and coins arrive, transfer $2.00 worth of coins to wallet.
  
When the $2.00 arrives, wipe the wallet and recover with seed words.
  
When wallet is recovered and still has the $2.00 in coins on it, transfer the rest of the coins over to it in chunks of $250.00 each.
  
Confirm each transaction hits the wallet before starting the next one.
  
When done, put seed words into a very safe place like a safe deposit box in a bank.

It doesn't say unknown reasons.  It says they ain't saying the reason due to security issues.  This means it is a 99% chance that OP has been caught out by his bank and law enforcement for shady dealings.

Based on the text of OPs comment compared to the scammer's Twitter text being almost identical.  Based on the CEO of Kraken's response.  Based on logical thought rather than the rabid 'OMG Kraken iz INSOLVENT!!!11!' frothing at the mouth that happens here all time time.  Based on the fact that many of the mopes in the sub love to whine about rules being used in large exchanges that are subject to KYC laws while at the same time whining when they get fleeced by some site like YerCoinzAreSafeYarr.ru.

So you are advocating this guy do criminal acts using BTC?  It is attitudes like this that are holding BTC back from full acceptance as a bona fide currency in general society.  Yes people do it all the time with fiat but when people do it with BTC, it adds to the overall idea that BTC should not be used as 'real' currency because it is the method of choice for illegal activities.
@_date: 2017-10-28 18:20:19

@_date: 2017-09-01 04:16:57


  
Then BTC is not for him I think.  People have made a lot of money in it, but they have also lost a lot as well.  It is true that the gains are really high...higher than stocks right now but they could just as easily become lows in a very short time.
  
Best case...I would say "Give me $100 to put in it and we'll sell in 3 months no matter what.  We'll sell back the $100.00 and keep the balance as profit in BTC if there is more, and if there is less, we'll sell it and take the loss, and never speak of this again."
@_date: 2017-09-13 18:10:37


  
Don't **EVER** 'expect' it to go up.  It might never go back up.  BTC is NOT a get rich quick scheme.  It is an investment speculation.  If you cannot afford to lose that money, then you had no business buying into it. 
  
IMO you have nothing to worry about, but have no illusions...no one can predict what will happen.  I think too many people are buying into it without realizing this and they will get seriously burned if the price does not go back up, or they panic and sell at a loss before it does.
  
Educate yourself on ALL investment speculations before putting dollar one into them.  And the number one rule of any investment is: Never invest more than you can afford to completely lose.
@_date: 2017-10-23 17:02:12

@_date: 2017-10-28 16:40:42
Apparently it is over $3000.00 per day that makes you a business regardless of the medium of your transaction.  That makes sense because I used to sell on ebay but not at that level.  So it was personal.  If I were to open a store and ramp up the volume, then it would.  Lots of people run actual businesses via craiglist without owning a brick and mortar store.
@_date: 2017-10-28 15:48:48
Yeah OK.  But no, not really.  As someone else answered, he was doing it as a business, not as a personal investor.  That fact creates a list of things you need to do legally and he didn't do them.

You literally called it out in your original post.  It is a Ponzi Scheme.  They paid you with the last sucker's money.

Ha.  The keys won't get lost in a bank deposit box.  And I've been married for 25 years.  If there is anything my wife wanted to 'steal' from me, she would have done it a long time ago.
    


  
My keys are 100% safe.  The executor of my will has instructions on how to recover and use them in the event of my death.  No passwords or seed words are in said instructions.  I don't advertise that I hold crypto to the general population.  And even if I did, the only thing they could get from burglarizing the house is my Trezor.  So have fun with that.  And if they try the five dollar wrench hack, then I give them the password to the decoy wallet that holds 0.021 BTC.
  


  
Again, I cannot get 'hacked' because the sensitive information *has never been on my computer* (do you not understand this statement?).  It is far more likely that Coinbase will get hacked than my Trezor.  For both technical and practical reasons - we've covered the technical reasons.  The practical one is simply that I do not have billions of dollars worth of Bitcoin.  If I did, I most certainly would not be on Reddit.  Coinbase has an enormous target on their back that is tested almost continuously.  And while they have been solid to date, no system that complex is perfect and it is only a matter of time before an outsider gets in, or an insider makes a move.
  
Here we are in 2018, having seen an immensely long list of exchanges that did exit scams, got hacked, or just went belly up.  From Mt. Gox all the way to the most recent hack of the day from   And still people are rationalizing keeping their coins on them long term.  It boggles my mind to understand why.
  
Online exchanges are only as good as their worst security person and/or flaw.  No one EVER thought Bear Stearns or Lehman Brothers would have folded...until they did.  No one ever though that Karpeles would have pulled the shit he did...until he did.  No one ever thought that Bitfinex could get hacked past 2FA...until it did.  But I guess if you don't mind risking your coin against '36% socialized losses' being forced on your account, then that's up to you.

Time to contact support from both Coinbase and Google IMO.  But in general, don't use a feature that involves moving your coins without understanding what it does 100% prior to doing so, and always test it first with a trivial amount of coin.

OP said if it goes up **by** $1000.  So pretend 1 BTC  = $100 when OP buys it.  Now the price goes up by $1000.  So 1 BTC = $1100.  So yes, as written, OP would have $1100 if he were to sell his 1 BTC.

This won't be true.  BTC adoption is growing every day.  You will be able to use BTC as currency at many places.
  


  
A lot of people who own them are not criminals.  I bought them as an investment and do not engage in criminal activity.
  


  
They are too far entrenched in fiat to drop it completely.  They may create their own crypto, but unless it sees mass adoption, it will go no where.

Here's a Helpful Tip from the Kitchen of Heloise:
  
Using Bitcoin to buy shit that is illegal or hide your money from the IRS is NOT an effective way of 'circumventing government authority'.  Doing so only gives you a warm feeling in your no-no parts when you tell yourself that.  There **is** no effective way to circumvent government authority.  If the government truly *truly* gives a single shit about you and wants to fuck you, there is not a damn thing that you, your Bitcoin, your guns, your SovCit declarations, your hidden cabin in the fucking woods, your buddy who works for the EPA, or any other fucking thing you can think of will be able to do about it.  The Fed is bigger, has more resources, and WAY more powerful guns along with the people to shoot them than anything anyone can whip out.  You've got a home full of survivalists with AR-15s?   Adorable.  Meet our Apache Helicopter, brah.
  
Short of a full on, nation wide, organized literal citizen revolt, revolution, and violent takeover, we are as a collective unit, subject to their whims however bizarre they may be.  The Fed could make the color yellow illegal tomorrow and there is ultimately dick we could do about it without being willing to commit to a level of revolt that few in this country would agree to or be capable of.  Can't do your revolution just now dude, gotta update my Facebook and check my Fantasy Football standings.
  
That is one thing that this whole Ross tale should fuking demonstrate for crying out loud.  They wanted him gone and he is effectively as dead as fried chicken despite his Bitcoin, his network of so-called friends, and all of the lawyers he could muster.  
  
So have fun with your 'circumvention'.

This is the one thing that I fucking hate about Bitcoin.  All the fucktards who want to use it to get away with something that is illegal really put the general public off as far as ANYTHING having to do with global adoption as an actual currency.  You sit there and fucking whine about how it is becoming SO hard what with Coinbase and KYC and all that government shit to buy your half ounce of heroin.

Because right now, it is way easier for a business to take fiat.  Cash, obviously.  Credit/debit/checks already have the infrastructure in place that is universally accepted and recognized.
  
Honestly IMO what is holding BTC back from this move to the mainstream is the fact that it can buy so many illegal things much easier.  That gives it a really bad name to the uneducated business person.  They do not want to have their business name associated with that secret money system that they saw in the news when Silk Road went down.

If it goes up and you want to ease your anxiety, then sell off $1000 worth to cover your initial investment.  Then ride the rest knowing it is free money.
  
If it goes down then don't worry because of two reasons:
  
1. It is very unlikely that you will lose it all and the price will probably go back up sometime sooner or later.
2.  This $1000 is money you could 100% afford to put in a box and set on fire.  Right?  Because that's what you start with.  Money you would not miss if it disappeared.
  
If  is not correct, then don't panic.  It has a decent chance of going up more.  But it absolutely WILL go down as well.  Just don't ever sell out at a loss no matter what.  As I said above, get your investment back when it is high and have fun watching the rest roller coaster.
  
Or be ballsy and say 'Fuck it, this will be a story I tell my grandkids one way or the other.' and hodl until the cows come home.

Millions of what?  The apparently to be failed US Dollar?  What good would that be?
@_date: 2015-04-25 17:47:53
Well that all depends on what you want BTC to be.  If you want it to be a shady "privacy" shield to make sure you can buy on the DarkNet without being arrested or for some other reason why you need to feel your money is "safe from being seized by the big bad government" then I suppose you are right.
  
But honestly, if your money is seized by the government (which WHY would this happen?) or it is taken by a BTC scam setup, what's the difference?
  
And sure you can go cold storage.  Fine.  But guess what?  Until and unless BTC gets WIDESPREAD usage across society then it will be useless except for buying a very small list of things that people in general do not need.  Sure I can buy a radio controlled car or a t-shirt.  Whoopdee-doo.
  
If you want BTC to REALLY be powerful and gain acceptance then it MUST be picked up by the general public.  It cannot be some back room cryptocurrency that only drug dealers use and it cannot be something that the average mope on the street will say "Huh.  What's THAT?".  And in order to reach that goal, the average person MUST be assured that they are investing in a safe place that does not also cater to mafia types.
  
And as I said before, the price of that general assurance will be the rules and regs that come along with US finance environments.  BTC will never ever get anywhere without both morphing how we do business, AND also morphing from its current state.  Because right now, the general populace sees it as either "black money" that is used for criminal activity, a fad that will go away leaving investors broke, or electronic play money that no serious investor would ever consider.  People work hard for their pay and need a REASON to part with it for any transaction be that purchases or investments.

When I had to make a withdrawal greater than what the local branch could manage they told me to go to the main office downtown because the cash holdings were larger than the satellite locations.  I suppose if 500 morons showed up demanding cash money they would do what they could and then request a transfer from corporate.  And I am sure that somewhere in the terms of agreement you sign when opening an account it says something like you won't be an asshole about it if this were to ever occur.  Back in the day it was more of an actual danger to banks but not anymore.
@_date: 2018-04-22 17:16:28


  
Yes.  And putting it in quotes does not make it any less my money.  Banks are businesses in the end, and all businesses exist to make money.  They do so in this example by storing our money securely and then using it to give loans and collecting interest.  This is an agreement by both parties, not just the bank, and not just the depositor.  If you want to stuff $20,000 into your mattress or move it all to BTC because you are paranoid about the government, that I suppose is your prerogative.  I choose to use something I trust more than my mattress or the volatility of crypto.
  


  
More secure.  I have no reliable way to keep the money I have saved more secure than in a bank.  And I am not about to flip all my fiat into BTC because I am not a moron.  Ergo, I use a bank.
  


  
Yes.  See point   For people like me, which is the vast majority of the population, they keep my money secure and provide loans if needed.
  
What really gets me is all the people who call me a sheep because I trust my government and I trust my bank are really good at making wide sweeping statements that come down on both items.  But to date, not a single one of them can provide me with a better solution for managing my finances.  If you DO have a way to keep my savings both secure and yet still accessible when I need it, then by all means, let's hear about it.  And again, moving all my fiat into crypto is bluntly, a really fuking stoopid idea.  BTC is far too volatile and not universally accepted as a currency.  Until and unless that day comes, the system we have in place now works really well.
@_date: 2016-10-12 17:34:02
No.  Even if his shill showed up at a bank with 23 million dollars to "deposit" they are going to want to know WTF is up.  Back in the day, he (and/or his shills) literally walked into banks with bags of cash, paid the bribes to the dudes and walked out with it deposited.
@_date: 2018-04-22 01:24:18
What would in theory be catastrophic is so many people demanded paper money that the banks could not supply enough because it is mostly electronic.  But actual banks are insured by the US Govt for up to $100,000 per depositor so it would take a very concerted effort to do this.  And it actually may be a crime to seriously conspire to do this.  That last part is honestly me pulling it out of my ass but it honestly sounds like something that could get you into trouble.
  
EDIT:  And of course that would be an amazingly stupid thing to do anyway.  People walking around with $10,000 in cash in a fucking bag just because some rando on Reddit said we should give it a try.  There is a reason banks exist and it is mainly to keep your cash secure.

Interesting, I never thought about the receiving stolen goods angle.  With the right lawyer, that shit could stick.  After all, as you said you can trace the path all the way back to creation.  If you then do not perform your due diligence in confirming they are not soiled maybe you can be convicted.  And tumbling is nothing more than laundering by a different name.

@_date: 2018-04-23 00:08:34


  
Really?  Why?  Because I quoted *actual tax law* that applies to BTC (with a legitimate source), or because I said OP should not dump all his pay into an incredibly volatile investment commodity?  Because at this point in time, BTC is not a currency.  And wanting to find ways to screw the system and avoid paying taxes just means you're an asshole who's contributing to the financial problems we have as a country IMO.  It slows down the overall acceptability of BTC as an actual currency.  PLUS it gives the government a GREAT reason to decide "Hey maybe we should be clamping down on that shit a little more if people are using it as an illegal tax dodge."
  
And I was an employee at a 2 person company for 13 years.  So I've already been in business.  I participated in virtually every aspect of how the company was run.

And yet, this remains a mystery.  You have, once again, deflected the task of providing evidence because:
  
1. You claim we would ignore it, despite assertions to the opposite. 
2. You claim to be somehow 'connected' and 'know people' and 'know things'
  
Neither of those are actual arguments that will hold up a debate they are simply means to move the topic off point.

The average person reading it might come to the conclusion that you are simply making generalized statements that have no actual reality behind them.

I am not an accountant or anything like that so take this with a grain of salt.  But IMO this is a bad idea.  Because the price changes so quickly, you can be on the hook for a lot of taxes.
  
On Day One you are give $100 worth of BTC.  Three days later you convert it to fiat but in that time, the price goes up and what you have is now worth $150.  When you sell it to get fiat, you will owe tax on that $50.00.
  
Of course the numbers are just examples but this is in essence how it works in the USA.  If the price DROPPED by $50 in that time, you could claim a business loss on the $50 instead.
  
But it is an incredibly risky method of getting paid.  BTW this counts if you sell for fiat, trade for other crypto, or even purchase goods or services with the BTC.  This also counts with fractions of your coins too.  So you will need to calculate tax if you only move some of the BTC you own for any of the above.

If we want BTC to move into the mainstream, then we as a community need to disassociate it as much as possible with illegal actions.

Then stop whining and don't fucking use Coinbase.  Simple as that.  If enough people agree with you then they will fail.  Stop treating Bitcoin as a fucking extremist religion.
  
Personally I would rather not trade my fiat for BTC to some exchange that is seated in an obscure Eastern European country with probable ties to Russian Mafia or some place that is going to go poof one day like so many of the others already have.  If that requires me giving them a copy of my driver's license for that financial security then so be it.
  
You can call me a sheep all you want or quote Ben Franklin til you're blue in the face but in the end we both made the BTC investment.  You're not suddenly morally better than me just because you bought your coins through a Darknet or Localbitcoins.
  
Coinbase doesn't 'need' to do shit because they are trying to bring BTC into the mainstream and the US is a really good place to start doing just that.  But the price of admission to the general populace is their sense of security in the fiat they spend to get there.  The laws and policies they are adhering to is the path to that sense.  By saying that they should say "Fuck you" to those rules undermines the growth of BTC as a whole.
@_date: 2018-04-04 13:18:46
Well Mark, I guess your PGP message is proof enough for me.
  
I want to thank you.
  
Probably not something you hear a lot these days.  But back in the days before Gox went belly up, I was a plebe who had decided to look into bitcoins.  I had heard about them for a while but never had any money to invest.  
  
I had gotten a career level job then and decided to jump in.  Naturally I wanted the most trusted and stable place to put my first investment.  I chose Mt. Gox because, well because it was the obvious choice.
  
So I sent out all the information requested and waited.  Two weeks went by and I heard nothing.  I got some hardware fob in the mail that would give me access to my account, but no account had yet been set up.
  
I contact Tech Support who told me that things had been really backed up there and they'd get back to making my account in a week or so.  That sounded really odd to me.  But I waited anyway.
  
At the end of that week, I had still heard nothing.  So I reached out again.  I got an apology and pretty much the same answer.  At this point I decided maybe Gox was not the best place for my money and went elsewhere.  Honestly I don't even know where it was but the coins I bought eventually ended up safe on the Trezor that sits on my desk today.
  
A few days after I made my first purchase at the Gox alternative, I saw the news about the coins lock down.  Then it went belly up.  Then people we camping out in Japan with big signs.  But my coins were safe in my other account.
  
Had it not been for the immense incompetence of your staff at creating new accounts, I would have given Gox my very first coin purchase.  And would have almost immediately lost it all for good.  And then I most certainly would have been so soured at the experience that I would never have had anything to do with crypto again.
  
So again I want to thank you and your staff for fucking up my new account create request and bullshitting me about it to the point where I no longer trusted Mt. Gox.  I also learned almost firsthand why you never ever keep your coins on an exchange and always be in direct control of your keys.
  
Thanks.  A lot.  Seriously.  I actually told myself that if I ever had the chance to talk to you, this is what I'd say.  So I guess a bucket list item has been checked off as well.
  
Noice.  Hodl.

The original post here is trying to convince people that BTC is more secure.  And great that you offer a discount.  Not everyone does that.
  
Just because BTC is more inherently secure does not make it superior to use in practice.   Again, daily there are posts in the BTC subs about uneducated people losing thousands of dollars in BTC due to uneducated use.  BTC is way easier to use in an uneducated manner because people don't understand how to use it correctly.  It looks weird and complicated to the novice and any moron with some tech skills can make a killing fleecing these people.  They get robbed and then are out of BTC for life.
  
Not saying this never happens with CCs.  But people know the connection to a CC and their actual fiat.  And a CC is a lot easier to understand and use.
  
They both have major security advantages and both have major security flaws, period.  Like a gun, both can be really good to use or really bad to use.  It is all about responsible and educated exercise of the tool.

LOL - 
  
So let's assume everything you said in 1, 2 and 4 are true...which I am not sold on...but just for fun. 
  


  
This is NOT something that people who have no idea why they should buy BTC should be told.
  


  
So, BTC is going to be as secure as say the 1890's?
  


  
It will if general public acceptability is desirable.  People are weary of bankers robbing them, why would they want to invest in something where a faceless bit of data can make their money go poof?
  
And I am not just talking about criminals who hack into accounts.  I am referring to the actual exchanges as well.  People are getting their money locked away because some algorithm decides they are "questionable".  Others are suddenly going bankrupt and your coins are vanishing in a puff of logic.  
  


  
There is if you want to actually make *money* from it.  Some people don't give two shits about buying something for BTC, they just want to make cash investing.  THAT is something that will get their attention and lead to potential acceptance.  Not the fact that you can now buy a Runescape membership with it.
  


   
So anytime you want to back that statement up with a guarantee, let me know.
  
BTW, I am not a hater, I actually own BTC.  I just find it ludicrous to think it will ever come even close to $10,000 much less $1,000,000 per.

OP SENT THE BTC **HIMSELF** to the "wrong address".  Supposedly.  I mean we are supposed to believe him based on the contents of this post.  Sure.
  
OP messed up badly.  If I were to about to send an entire BTC in a single transaction, I would have made DAMN SURE it was going to the correct address.  I get nervous moving 0.1 BTC.  
Assuming this is true (and that's a big one), it is the equivalent of OP putting $7000 cash in a box and mailing it to a random address.  Then after some time he calls them up and says "Hey I sent you some money a while ago.  Please give it back."

And at this point, the godfather is probably afraid that since he is already in so deep, he doesn't want to think he is getting robbed so he refuses to listen out of the irrational belief that somehow it will work out to his favor.

Indeed.  I am ignoring no facts, just explaining why they might be.  The cancellation was a form letter that will always say 'Please withdraw'.  The fact that the account was locked could be beyond the scope of tech support.  Or even more, perhaps they lock it to get him to try to claim it in order to establish his ownership of it during the process of an investigation.  Whatever.  
  
In any event, if you want to use BTC for shady purposes, don't use a place that is bound by KYC and then whine when they do something you don't like.  Funny how I have been using Coinbase since before BTC was worth 4 figures and I have never had a single issue.  Almost as if I have not been doing shady shit with it.  Almost.

Can you provide ANY evidence whatsoever that BTC will ever get to even *remotely close* to $1 million per?  Because honestly, all I have seen so far is crooks to the left, other crooks to the right, and what appear to be crooks in the middle.^1  
  
Add to that the fact that BTC prices right now are such that miners are having to shut down because they can't stay profitable along with the fact that each month, the BTC's mined will be more difficult and costly to get than the previous one.
  
What exactly are the drivers that are supposed to push this thing to $1 million/BTC?  Or even $1000/BTC?  And yes I am aware that is was at $1000/BTC at one point.  Why would it go there again?

Wow, so a Bitcoin enthusiast circlejerk is your response?  Sorry it is completely underwhelming.  No matter how much these oh-so-full-of-themselves people want to bluster about BTC, nothing addresses any of the issues I have brought up.
  
The crooks, the cost to mine vs. low return coupled with the ever increasing complexity to mine, and oh yes...the crooks.  It is every single day that this sub lists more reasons to run away from BTC than to jump in.  Unless and until the dishonesty factor is fixed definitively, BTC will be nothing more than a diversion that you might be able to flip into a profit if you buy/sell on a lucky day (and your exchange happens to not go belly up or disappear your coins or lock you out of your own transactions).
  
And one other thing - I find it interesting that people who get into BTC in a big way often point and say things like "This is how we as little people can stick it to the man and make money in spite of the Wall St big wigs."  Yet in almost every discussion about the incredible highs vs the incredible lows, there is the talk that this is due to the whims of the "big whales buying and dumping".  So tell me...how is **that** any different than the Wall St. Big Wigs?

Bitfinex was a result of bullshitting the customer into thinking their safetys were in place when they actually were not.  The huge flux of automated transfers should have triggered said safetys.

Using non-relevant and marginally true statements are not the way to convince someone to use BTC.

Well no, because they don't tell no matter the cause.  So if there is an investigation - say nothing.  If there is no investigation - say nothing.

Or were directed to not provide help by LE.
@_date: 2016-07-01 16:23:19
I still doubt your assertion.  Do you have evidence?
@_date: 2019-05-23 16:29:30


If it was something related to law enforcement do you *really* think they would tip their hand by saying "Hey OP you're being investigated so we have to close your account."?
@_date: 2017-06-12 02:17:22
Yes they did.

You cannot possibly think that this will ever actually happen.  Seriously, that money is long long gone and will never be returned to anyone who put it in there.  Anyone who tells you otherwise is lying, misinformed, hopelessly naïve, or any combination of the three.

No matter what happens with UASF, the price of BTC will definitely rise on Aug 2nd.  It will continue to grow until Sept. 19th, whereupon it will crash literally overnight to reach a mind numbing $48.44 per.
  
Source: My ass.  Because questions like this are impossible to answer so I may as well have fun with it.

Thanks for the reply.  It is a p2sh address.  I am using the plain old Blockchain app for Android.  I was not sure it would work in the first place but when it read the public key I was surprised when it failed on the private one.  I was only using Blockchain to track the paper wallet in case the gift recipient needed help in selling it or moving it somewhere off the paper.
  
I'll look into Samourai.

Obviously you did something with the coins that violates KYC.  And it is possible that they are under order not to release the coins due to an investigation.  Just sayin'
@_date: 2017-06-12 02:10:36
At first I thought this was a scam.  But then I saw that it has "Inatant Approval", so I am sold.
@_date: 2015-02-15 17:43:39
Because if it fails, I won't have lost a lot and if it succeeds, I'll have a bit more, potentially a lot more.
@_date: 2016-07-01 13:15:58
Yes.  But BTC fraud happens all the time.  Oh...you were talking about the CC.  Yes, that would be good if it never happened either.  But almost none of us live in HappyNoTheftLand.

A) The next bubble starts here: Better buy now
  
B) The next bubble starts lower than here: Buy now anyway because it will get here again eventually

I assume a Trezor would be an acceptable solution?  Or am I missing something?  I was about to buy one for this express purpose.
@_date: 2016-07-19 17:41:38


Those are the target mopes.  They know nothing about it so are easily mislead.

Mindless rant or sarcastic troll?
 
My wallet says:   
"Your ChangeTip Wallet balance is BTC39.34 bits or $0.009"
  
And  
  
"Top up your wallet  
  
Deposit Bitcoin directly to ChangeTip 
  
Buy Bitcoin via Coinbase 
  
Buy Bitcoin using your bank account "
@_date: 2016-07-01 16:11:04


No.  It is because CCs are in use vastly more than BTC is.
@_date: 2019-05-23 16:27:47


Unless they are being directed to do so by law enforcement.

This is a small amount of BTC as a gift to someone familiar with BTC but not actively buying coins.  I would like them to be able to move the coins easily if they want to just cash out.  Maybe a Segwit paper wallet is not the way to go.  I am fully aware of the issues around paper wallets.
