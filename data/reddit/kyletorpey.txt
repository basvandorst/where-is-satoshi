Mostly correct. They could store dollars on Circle/Coinbase though and use Bitcoin as a payment network only to save money on Amazon purchases via Purse.io. Store of value use case also interesting for the "average person," but yeah the people who should use Bitcoin are the ones who need it.

In the original version, there is a hard fork planned, but it's pretty vague (rightly so). It's unclear if it will be a simple block size limit increase or a long-term, adaptive block size solution.

The reality is a great communication platform doesn't exist. Theymos probably went overboard with the moderation when the block size issue first became the main issue in Bitcoin, but the fact of the matter is Reddit is useless without moderation. The other subreddit is filled with shit posts because it's basically a circle jerk of Classic supporters. Although this subreddit is better (IMO), it still has the issue of centralized moderation.  
  
Long story short, the support for Classic is much lower than Reddit may indicate. The true indicator of support is network hashrate, and Classic currently sits at roughly 5%.

Somewhat interesting piece, but a key point is that Bitcoin only needs to be "decentralized enough" to work. If miners needed to be anonymous for the system to work, they would be. Will be interesting to see what happens once something like Confidential Transactions is added to Bitcoin and CoinJoin is used by default on transactions.

In the past, BitPay transactions have been instant for me. Lately, there has been a delay on some transactions (sometimes as long as minutes). Not sure if this is just happening to me. These aren't confirmations; this is just the BitPay system realizing there is a transaction at all. Will need to see if it happens again next time.

AFAIK, there is no serious threat of a full RBF implementation without a functioning Lightning Network.

In fact, it would essentially allow for instant confirmations of Bitcoin transactions -- thus improving the security of those instant transactions he wishes to protect.

Truthcoin.info has more information. Bitcoins can be used to place bets in the system. Votecoins will likely be sold in a crowdsale eventually.

I like this better than the current model of appcoins. Having said that, an app that collects fees and pays dividends to stockholders could be easily replaced by one that does neither of those things and lowers prices for users. For example, a version of Storj that charged fees to reward stakeholders would have a competitive disadvantage to a forked version that charged no fees.

Some of the bigger books will probably adopt Bitcoin eventually, but they will likely only use it as a payment method rather than a currency. This means bettors will purchase bitcoins and then send them to the sportsbook. The sportsbook will then immediately sell the bitcoins for dollars, probably through something like BitPay (although I'm not sure if they work with gambling companies). In other words, this shows Bitcoin's value as a payment system, but it won't necessarily lead to an increase in the price of bitcoins.

On GHash: Ghash received a large portion of mining power and then lowered it due to the incentive to preserve bitcoin's value proposition as a censorship-resistant currency. The incentives originally setup by Satoshi are still working up to this point. Possible that could change in the future, but hasn't failed yet. Satoshi wrote about this before he disappeared; not anything new.

The problem with altcoins being sweet is that Bitcoin's first mover advantage actually makes the currency better because it has more liquidity, which leads to less volatility.

that's probably the piece that's received more pushback than anything else ive ever written. why btc is a better option than paypal is kind of the point of that piece, so i'd recommend reading the article for an answer to your question.  
  
the one thing i've already noted elsewhere is that i probably should have used "could" instead of "would" in the title.  
  
on being subjective, i agree. my point of view is obvious. i think Bitcoin is the most important invention since the Internet. that's why i write about it every day. the point of most of my work is to explain to people why Bitcoin is a big deal. other times it's on generally interesting stories in the Bitcoin world.  
  
my work is generally going to be positive about Bitcoin in general just because these are the conclusions i've come to after researching Bitcoin since 2011. i'll still write about the bad stuff in the space too though. i broke stories on how Jeff Garzik thinks NXT is a scam, and I've written about the troubles with altcoins in general quite a bit. When Max Keiser asked me what I thought about Auroracoin and other altcoins, I basically said they are pump and dumps. Also pointed out Gavin's comment on cloud mining companies being ponzi schemes when no one seemed to notice.

Sorry you were downvoted, but it wasn't me. I would say coinjoin doesn't need to be implemented at the protocol level. Whether it's zerocash as a sidechain or coinjoin and stealth addresses on Dark wallet, there will be enough privacy features in Bitcoin.

We were just talking about this in  the other day. In addition to the DAC option, there's also the possibility that a decentralized Reddit app could be hosted by a grid on Bitcloud voluntarily. This would mean no ads and no real reason for the app to need money. The only possible cost of keeping the app in operation would be paying some storage nodes for hosting data. It's possible that these funds could be collected through monthly crowdfunding campaigns.

NXT also has the central banker issue involved with POS. The earliest stakeholders (who are anonymous in this case, so it could just be one dude) can effectively act as central bankers due to the fact that they're the ones creating blocks.

Love the ideas here and it's actually similar to two concepts I've been thinking about:  
  
1) In the scenario where the frozencoins are used to prevent sybil attacks on an online poll, it would actually be better to use regular Bitcoin payments in certain situations. For example, if a podcast or online show was looking for a way to monetize their content without ads, they could have their listeners vote on who the next guest on the show should be. A Bitcoin address is attached to each possible guest, and the address with the largest number of bitcoins in it at the end of voting is the next guest on the show.  
  
2) Your part on Frozencoin and recommendation systems is something I've thought about rather extensively. A decentralized Reddit is one of the first apps that I would like to see built on top of Bitcloud, but dealing with Sybil attacks is rather difficult, even with your suggestions. Due to the fact that the frontpage of Reddit is prime real estate, it could turn into nothing but advertisements from companies who are upvoting their content. At the end of the day, you always still need some form of moderation from actual humans. One possible solution is to have moderators delete content that is obviously just an advertisement (much like normal subreddit moderators).  
  
As a side note, the use of moderation from actual humans is one of the key differences between Bitcloud and some of the other projects in the decentralized Internet space.

This is interesting. The eventual goal with the decentralized Reddit idea was basically to replace karma with bitcoin tips. This means people could post their content directly to the Reddit and the karma they received would also be bitcoin tips. Then there's the problem of people not wanting to pay for upvoting content, but they could also be allowed to invest in the content. This means they would actually receive a reward of bitcoins if the content they originally upvoted turned out to be a successful post. I think the moderators would still be needed for this proposal to work.

The way I look at OT vs Ethereum is OT's federated servers are practically trustless, but Ethereum's blockchain requires even less trust. Having said that, I'm fine with the level of trust required with OT servers, especially when you add in the coin agnostic/instant confirmation perks. Nothing excites me as much as OT. Hadn't heard about more possible delays, but I suppose that shouldn't come as a surprise in this space.

We started with the proof of bandwidth idea and it eventually evolved into proof of quality of service. Basically we are building a protocol (Bitcloud) that anyone can use to build DAs. Bitcloud is mainly a distributed cloud storage system and escrow agent. Publishers pay private node grids for storage and bandwidth, and Bitcloud acts as an escrow for the transaction. There is no new coin on the Bitcloud level, it merely interacts with Bitcoin. Currently working on a Wiki. You can see what I have so far here:

The tickets are auctioned off by the event organizer. This means scalpers cannot simply purchase tickets solely for the purpose of selling them at a higher price later. It's not really about completely preventing the reselling of tickets; more about scalpers raking in large profits from reselling a bundle of tickets they have to a sold out show. Perhaps demand for an Eminem concert is at around $100 tickets, but his promoter decides to set the price at $75 for each ticket. Scalpers may purchase a bunch of tickets solely for the purpose of reselling them later. With the auction system, the tickets would be sold at $100 a pop from the start.

When it comes to Safecoin, it seems the lack of transaction fees is a valid argument. The other features you listed will be included in Bitcoin soon enough thanks to Open Transactions and other projects. I'd be happy if Maidsafe worked, as all that added value of the network would go to bitcoin due to the fact that it's a better form of money to use to pay for Maidsafe apps and services.

"Other systems like Counterparty and Mastercoin cannot process unconfirmed transactions.

Ignoring the fact that the numbers are completely made up, there's also the problem of Bitcoin being used as a payment system, not a currency, at the largest casinos. This means bitcoin's value is only slightly increased as a commodity rather than massively increased as a money. If people are depositing bitcoins and the sportsbook or casino is immediately selling them and denominating the deposit in fiat, then there isn't much increase to the value of bitcoin at all. It simply applies another use case for the fundamental or "intrinsic" value of a bitcoin.

What does BFL have to do with access to your bitcoins?  
  
GHash should be proof that the current incentive model still works. They were getting too much of the hashrate, and they lowered it because their large control over the hashrate actually hurt the perception of the very commodity they were mining. Having said that, there are definitely improvements that should be made to bring more decentralization to mining.  
  
That stuff misses the point though. Government-backed bank insurance doesn't help in a country like Argentina with harsh capital controls. The point is a bank can block what you do with your money, and they can also be coerced into telling you what to do or blocking your account by a government. Bitcoin provides censorship-resistance. This is the reason it was created in the first place.

They must also think about the risk/reward of holding bitcoin instead of paying 1% on both sides of the transaction if they'd like to essentially peg their coins to the dollar or euro.  
  
I still think it's most useful to gamblers as a payment mechanism for now. But of course, that doesn't mean money will be always going in and out of the system right away.

Thanks for responding again.  
  
Before I respond to the body of your text, I'd like to point out that I made a mistake with the Louis CK piece in not making it clear that it was a "this could happen/thought experiment". All I can do now is learn from that mistake and keep it in mind for future theoretical pieces.  
  
The piece wasn't a promotion of BTC, it was a "look at this cool thing that Louis CK could do with Bitcoin." At least that was the goal.  
  
Don't think I stated $5 transactions were Bitcoin's best use case. Having said that, it's still much better at those than PayPal. Also, I have done pieces on international travel. Talked with someone from BTCTrip about how they are targeting hotel chains and wrote this piece a few months ago:   
  
I'm sure I have other travel pieces as well, just can't think of any off the top of my head. Travellers were actually one of the main groups of consumers I told a Bitcoin startup to target when I was consulting with them on marketing. Definitely agree with you there.  
  
When I use Bitcoin, I just scan a QR code with my phone. If you want to do the same thing you're talking about with Steam, you can just use Coinbase. They'll let you make payments in a manner quite similar to PayPal. For me, Bitcoin is already more convenient than PayPal. Although, there is still plenty of room for improvement in finding that convenience/security holy grail.  
  
I literally did what you suggested in your last paragraph a few days ago:   
  
To be honest, it seems like we agree on a lot of points. Perhaps you should begin to take a look at my entire body of work rather than one article I wrote about my theories on Bitcoin crowdfunding solutions. Having said that, I still find your criticism valuable. As I said at the top, I now know that I should be more explicit when I'm theorizing rather than writing about an imminent event.

If the Bitcoin ledger was not decentralized and censorship-resistant, there would be no point to creating it. The whole reason bitcoins have value is because they are censorship-resistant. I'm not sure what other features you're referring to, but features such as no chargebacks and low fees are only possible due to the censorship-resistant nature of the protocol. It also would have already been shutdown like Liberty Reserve or e-gold if it was not censorship-resistant. This is the key reason Bitcoin was created, as Satoshi notes in his white paper:  
  
"What is needed is an electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust,
allowing any two willing parties to transact directly with each other without the need for a trusted
third party."

I see your point more clearly now. I still think people selling hard drive space will be more likely to sell their Storj tokens for fiat rather than bitcoins because this is what happens with nearly all merchants. Bitcoin is their intro to crypto, but they want to immediately jump ship for the "safety" of fiat. I don't see why people selling storage space wouldn't take similar actions.

If you're not familiar with these projects, look into Open Transactions, Bitshares, Mastercoin, Ethereum, etc.

You're paying one way or another whether it's POW or bitcoin. Bitcoin is just a commodity mined through POW.  
  
This solution built on bitcoin has some perks that are not found in bitmessage. For example, messages last forever rather than 3 days. You pay more, you get a better messaging app (if the anti-spam measures in bitmessage are still as weak as I remember).

Yeah when I asked Fred about a normal retail scenario he said he would definitely recommend having the transaction sent to the customers device rather than having the customer insert their smart card into some kind of POS terminal.

Would it be possible to force a user to sign a message with their 3rd key to make a massive withdrawal? Of course, this would be an optional feature. This could prevent a hacker from emptying a wallet if they have access to a user's account credentials. Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the multisig implementation?

This is why we decided no to create a new coin for Bitcloud. We're just using Bitcoin to pay storage nodes on the Bitcloud network. You can find us at I wish MaidSafe all the best because they are trying to do something similar to us, but I think their code would be forked to work with Bitcoin if the MaidSafe network turns out to be the right solution. This is why I didn't buy any safecoins.

Is it really an investment in Counterparty if XCP isn't directly tied to the growth of the platform? Seems like it would make more sense to just hold bitcoins.

When referring to appcoins, I'm referring to the tokens outlined in David Johnston's decentralized applications paper. WoW gold is a centralized video game currency. You use it to purchase digital goods. That use case doesn't exist in decentralized apps. If you know of an appcoin that does work like WoW gold, then please let me know.  
  
As a side note, I do think it is possible for "network coins" to work:   
  
But it could make more sense to just issue stock in those cases.

I haven't built it on my own, but there still seem to be a good number of bugs to sort out according to the bitcointalk thread. Having said that, the testers seem to be claiming that the P2P Trade feature works. Counterparty is awesome for getting this feature to work without requiring people to use XCP, but they still require XCP for some things (asset issuance, placing bets). At the end of the day, I still see something like Open Transactions being the best solution for distributed exchange. Blockchains still have the problem of not allowing for instant confirmations.

I use to hold the same opinion, but the issue is when it comes to the liquidity of the token being used for the new features. I like the ability to use bitcoins for distributed exchange of assets on Counterparty, but XCP are still required for bets and issuing new assets. Wouldn't it be better to have the ability to place bets with bitcoins? It's basically the choice between: awesome features with a more volatile currency (Mastercoin/NXT/Counterparty) or more slowly implemented features and a less volatile currency (Bitcoin/Colored Coins).  
  
It always comes back to Bitcoin's network effect that makes it less volatile, and therefore, a better form of money. I think all of these features would work better if they all used the same token (Bitcoin).
@_date: 2014-04-07 18:17:16

If you're talking about how appcoins are really Kickstarters and not IPOs or investments, I see what you mean. The problem is many of these apps also need a somewhat stable currency to function properly, so they may not even work until they are forked to work directly with bitcoin.  
  
Having said that, doing a Kickstarter when you know a lot of people are viewing it as an investment is somewhat shady IMO. If it was just a kickstarter, you could have just raises bitcoins.
@_date: 2014-05-26 01:02:15
Much like basically all other forms of digital money, colored coins are nothing more than IOUs. You still have to trust that the issuer of the colored coin actually has the asset that backs up the colored coin. This gets to the point of the bitcoin's intrinsic value in the first place. Bitcoins are the only form of digital money that do not require you to trust a 3rd party. Lack of counterparty risk + censorship resistance = the bitcoin's intrinsic value.
@_date: 2014-08-31 18:46:07
The difference is its 4% at all bitcoin merchants, not a one time deal. It's basically a better version of a credit card rewards card. In reality, someone could link their debit card to a circle or coinbase account and then receive a 4% discount on everything without realize they're using bitcoin.

Hmm...with the new (supposedly) anonymous version of bittorrent, you're sort of right. This actually removes the need to pay seeders or storage nodes with some form of cryptocurrency (as long as the uploader is able to self-host at first). The only thing I'm worried about here is the low quality of content that may be uploaded (although paying for posting to the list of magnet links on the blockchain is a somewhat decent anti-spam mechanism.)

Are the incentives for farming setup in the same manner as bitcoin or gold mining? As in, more farmers will join the network as the resources you mentioned become limited. This seems like it would lead to a stable price rather than an increase in value.

Here's what I could find:  
  
1. The asset being sold must be an investment property and can't be a personal residence.
2. The asset being purchased with the proceeds must be similar to the asset being sold.
3. The proceeds from the sale must be used to purchase the other asset within 180 days of the sale of the first asset, although you must identify the property or asset that you are purchasing in the like-kind exchange within 45 days of the sale.

From Reddit's perspective, what are the benefits of using a decentralized ledger rather than one they control themselves?

I generally agree. People tend to be pretty self-centered (not removing myself from that accusation). I think the biggest driver of Bitcoin adoption will be the cryptoeconomy that it makes possible. It will create the freest economy in the world when combined with PGP, Tor, OpenBazaar, etc. I think people will move to this new economy for reasons similar to why they moved to America in the early days. The lack of taxes and regulation in the cryptoeconomy leads to lower prices, better-paying jobs, better overall business environment, etc.  
  
People don't have to be conscious cryptoanarchists for this to happen. They only need to find a personal use case for joining the cryptoeconomy. Any early example would be people who used Silk Road to sell pot. There are many reasons to avoid local government laws and regulations in the cryptoeconomy, and everyone will have their own reason. For many early adopters, it was mainly just political idealogy. We'll have to wait and see what else happens once OpenBazaar enters the mainstream.

Not sure if you read the article, but there are certain use cases where Bitcoin is the best/only option. Also, bitcoins can be viewed as a commodity for reasons other than just payments.

NXT is certainly flawed -   
  
But even if POS is less wasteful or more secure, it's important to remember that Bitcoin only needs to be "good enough." As long as Bitcoin mining remains decentralized enough, there wouldn't be a reason to move to POS. I don't think anyone is going to move to another coin due to mining centralization until something bad actually happens (for better or worse).

The coin matters because there are plenty of payments that aren't instant. For example, bitcoin would not be by far the most widely used currency on darknet marketplaces if your argument were true. Also, merchants do not want to accept cryptocurrencies built on insecure blockchains.  
  


  
Unless you're talking about market pegged assets, colored coins come with counterparty risk. Market pegged assets are an interesting concept, but we'll have to wait to see if they actually work. If they do work, then the most secure blockchain again becomes the most important point.  
  


  
Speculators don't get to choose the money that everyone else in the world uses. If this argument held any weight, then Facebook wouldn't have over a billion users. After all, the new users are rewarding early investors in Facebook who have actually contributed nothing to the economy.  
  


  
It would be great if all cryptocurrency liquidity could be counted together, but that's not how it works. Different cryptocurrencies have different values. There isn't a "cryptocurrency" coin that can be used for value transfers. This point makes no sense.

Like in the case of Auroracoin where the "market cap" was over $1 billion at one point. Some altcoins were at least valuable for innovation purposes since new features couldn't really be tested out on the Bitcoin blockchain. Hopefully this new project can bring that liquidity back to the Bitcoin network, but I feel there are still plenty of people who will want to play the casino of the altcoin market in the future. The lack of value in altcoins will become more obvious with sidechains, but that lack of value should already be pretty apparent. And it hasn't stopped people from speculating on altcoins so far.

If I understand Koinify correctly, they are about building new appcoins to fund Dapps. The only appcoins that grow with the size of the app's network are network coins like LTBcoin. This is because the price of advertising on the network can become more expensive as the network earns more viewers. All other appcoins try to compete with bitcoin as money, which is a foolish thing to do. Holders of bitcoin will just switch to the appcoin to pay for the service, and the people receiving the appcoin as payment for their service will immediately sell it for bitcoin. This means the value added actually going to bitcoin. Crowdfunding needs to take place without creating appcoins.

Early adopters are the ones who need it the most, so it may simply not make sense for you to use it for payments at this point in time. Bitcoin isn't an obvious need for everyone in the world right now; just the people who need a cheap, irreversible form of censorship-resistant digital money.

Yes, but it is from the summary portion. Saying that Charlie allowed BTCKing to place multiple orders per day for amounts over $1,000 ignores the fact that he was a reseller.  
  
It's important to point out that the tactics used by BTCKing could have been used by anyone. The reason he didn't ban BTCKing was that it would be possible to do so. When you allow anonymous transactions for $1,000 less, you're allowing customers to make multiple purchases of bitcoins that total over $1,000 per day by definition.

I get the increase in value part. My misunderstanding involves how an increase in token value does not also lead to an increase in the price of storage for users. My assumption is that the price for storage must be fixed in safecoins for the value of the coins to grow as the network grows, but I've also been told this is incorrect. I think the issue might be that I'm looking for a concrete connection between network growth and token value increase while the reality is safecoins are able to float in value more as a currency.
@_date: 2014-09-18 03:19:58
Definitely hard to predict which one of us is right here. I actually advocated the fees for shareholders model for Bitcloud originally. I was eventually convinced that it makes more sense to move the monetary incentives for Bitcloud up another layer. Grids on Bitcloud could be DAOs and issue tokens that pay dividends.  
  
I suppose I'd have to think about whether hosting/storage could just be a special case where I don't necessarily agree with the shares model. One of the main reasons I don't think it would be a good option for Bitcloud/Storj/MaidSafe is its an underlying protocol/platform. This should not be monetized/controlled by anyone. I think when you're building a platform for other DAOs/DACs/Dapps, you need to create the free protocol and then let people build businesses on top of it. Kind of like the Internet itself.  
 
It's actually been almost a year since I was outnumbered on the shares debate with Bitcloud devs, but I wouldn't mind thinking about the topic again. I definitely wasn't completed convinced that the shares model couldn't work, it was more that I was just outnumbered.

There's also a proposed solution that uses bitcoin instead of an altcoin called Bitcloud. Actually I think there are two different Bitcloud projects now.

This is technically true, but as you said, sending a transaction with a fee under 0.0001 is risky. The new system will allow Bitcoin transaction fees to be recommended to users "on the fly" based on other transactions in the network at that time. This is what would replace the default/recommended minimum fee of 0.0001.

Not sure if security is actually improved with Bitcoin. They could always rollback the ledger in a rare instance where they are hacked.  
  
Trying to make the system trustless seems pointless if Reddit has to approve every transaction.  
  
Transparency is a good point.  
  
It seems like there aren't any huge advantages to either option IMO.  
  
Edit: I suppose the idea of outsourcing security and trading to a decentralized blockchain instead of trusting someone else could be a benefit as well. Lower costs for Reddit while not necessarily reducing security.

We've thought of trying to build this kind of platform on top of Bitcloud, and this is the main issue we ran into. One thing to note is that it's unlikely that the most upvoted content will just be spam because moderators still exist. If someone posts bad content and it's obvious that it was bought and paid for by a bot, then it can still be removed by a moderator. Trying to cheat the system could create a situation where a spammer pays a lot of money for content that gets removed by a mod.  
  
Another interesting thing to note about this system is that it could be a way to send microtips to the content creators if the microtransactions were sent to the creators of the content rather than just to Reddit for spam prevention measures.

Although rare, this form of banking does exist. Coinbase and Circle are two examples. Peter Schiff's EuroPac Bank is another.  
  


  
Coinbase literally has a feature called "vault." You're ignoring the part of Coinbase and Circle where they provide storage of bitcoins. You don't have to buy or sell bitcoins to use their services.  
  


  
Again, you're ignoring a huge part of what Circle and Coinbase provide. They are holding the private keys, which means they are holding the bitcoins. These companies don't have the "sole purpose of processing payments and taking a cut on fees"; they're also used to store bitcoins.

Pretty awesome quotes:  
  
“Bitcoin represents not only the future of payments but also the future of governance,” Mr. Hock said. “We live in the 21st century but are still using command and control organizational structures from the 16th century. Bitcoin is one of the best examples of how a decentralized, peer-to-peer organization can solve problems that these dated organizations cannot."  
  
-Dee Hock, Founder of Visa  
  
"Bitcoin represents a real opportunity for changing that. Money at its core is simply a ledger for keeping track of debts and Bitcoin is truly the best iteration of a universal ledger we’ve ever seen. The mere fact that there will never be more than 21 million bitcoins and that each bitcoin can be divided into 100 million units makes it a significant improvement on any historical form of currency.”

This could definitely work for the adult industry too. My real question with this model is whether it could work for everyone or just the top performers in each area of content. For your industry, I assume it could be used to have fans vote on various types of scenes with certain performers. This is an experiment. I think content creators are losing control over the money made from the product as you stated. Other people are posting content everywhere and taking the advertising profits, and piracy is also a problem. I think crowdfunding the production of the content and then releasing it for free may be the best option. Of course, we won't know until someone tries. Your use case actually gives more credibility to the reasons why Bitcoin is necessary. A lot of people will want to donate/vote anonymously.

Colored coins are basically bitcoins that represent something else.

Bitcoin has more liquidity and stability; therefore, it is a better option as money. Bitcoin is basically an example of the power of a network effect on steroids because it is the network effect of money. I wrote about this back in February:   
  
The Nakamoto Institute has also covered this topic rather extensively.  
  


  
Those centralized ledgers have counterparty risk. There is no centralized entity who controls the ledger with Bitcoin. That's the point.  
  
It is possible to use Bitcoin anonymously (I'm using this word for sake of argument, I don't think any cryptocurrency can truly be deemed anonymous at this point in time), it just takes more work when using Bitcoin (as of now). I agree that zerocash would be great. I know Adam Back has talked with the zerocash team, at least at a minimal level, about implementing zerocash as a sidechain.

For POS to work with Bitcoin, they'll need to use network propogation. Basically, they don't need to wait for a confirmation as long as it's been sent through a large percentage of the network.

I could be wrong, but I think a selfish miner could also run a large number of nodes to make sure they find out almost exactly when another miner has found a block.

That high number is a pro, not a con. Simply allowing changes to happen more quickly is not automatically good. We should not seek more changes, we should seek more beneficial changes. This high threshold helps us get more of the latter. The high threshold is a protection against hysteria-induced changes (think Patriot Act after 9/11). Hopefully sidechains will allow more experimentation to take place without having the majority force hard forks on the minority.

Full excerpt about bitcoin:  
  
"There’s a lot that Bitcoin or Ripple and variants can do to make moving money between countries easier and getting fees down pretty dramatically. But Bitcoin won’t be the dominant system. When you talk about a domestic economy, [you must have] the idea of attributed transactions, where if you sent it to the wrong person you can actually get the transaction reversed. [And a traditional system] doesn’t have this huge fluctuation where the value of your account is going up and down by a factor of two. We need things that draw on the revolution of Bitcoin, but Bitcoin alone is not good enough."

The whole point of bitcoin is that it's censorship-resistant money. This is the core principle that gives it value. Having said that, web wallets have their place, and varoius features, such as multi-sig addresses and voting pools, should make them more secure over time.

Do you have to use XCP or assets created from XCP to trade assets or can you just use bitcoins?  
  
Edit: It seems you can trade directly with bitcoins. XCP are simply required for creating an asset. That's where XCP gets its value. I guess I still don't see the need for the currency though. Bitcoins could be used just as easily, which I believe is the case with colored coins.

I assume you mean 10 minute confirmation times. Altcoins are decent testnets for perceived issues with bitcoin, but that's all they really are right now. Although changes to bitcoin come slow, it also takes a long time for new consensus mechanisms to be considered secure. For me, there has never been a situation where I thought, "I need to switch to another altcoin to do this particular transaction."

The analogy is that it's difficult to change the Constitution (this is what we are talking about). The processes for changes are indeed different (this is a new topic).  
  
Your third paragraph is unrelated to the topic at hand. Perhaps you could implement your proposed mechanism for consensus as a sidechain.  
  
I think the Constitution and climate change analogies are both good. The GOP and Vietnam ones are the ones that didn't make too much sense to me. Perhaps the true analogy involves not making rash changes when you have a core list of guidelines/principles. Of course, bad decisions can be made with near-universal consensus too (as with the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution). Of course, senators work on different incentives than miners.  
  
Bitcoin is not easily changed, but more-flexible layers can be built on top of it. This is where much of the innovation/evolution can take place while avoiding constant changes to the consensus rules.  
  
I would say the calls for democracy are causing the issues in Bitcoin. This is not supposed to be a democracy (in my view). Actual scaling solutions, such as the Lightning Network, are currently in the works. The block size limit is mostly a distraction.

Nubits/Tether/BitUSD - Hedging to fiat is already available through Locks (as you know) and other services. Circle is also rolling out their own version. Platforms such as Veritaseum and Hedgy are also coming online for locking value to other assets. BitUSD may also not be worth the trouble (see:   
  
Dash and Monero - As mentioned in another comment, bitcoin will almost certainly offer better privacy in the future (likely via zerocash). At that point, there will be no reason to use Dash or Monero.  
  
NXT - Bitcoin also has two separate asset exchanges built on top of it (Counterparty and Omni). Having said that, I've never really had an awesome experience with a blockchain-based exchange. Perhaps colored coins + Monetas is the correct long-term solution here.  
  
As many others in this thread have stated, I view altcoins as experiments for features that may eventually be added to bitcoin. The altcoins with the highest level of popularity also seem to have similar, competing projects that work directly with bitcoin. You are right to say that some altcoins will have value as long as they do something that users find valuable, but that time period of added value is not likely to last very long. Also, the fact that an altcoin is useful for a specific purpose does not necessarily mean that it makes sense to hold it (see:

Privacy is essential for Bitcoin's main use case (censorship resistant transactions) and fungibility.  
  


  
The one thing I pointed out in the piece is that it makes it easier for any business, include retail stores (non financial institutions) to collect data on users and turn this into the default way of thinking.

Not necessarily. Identifying the users behind transactions at centralized exchanges etc is definitely bad for Bitcoin, but I'd say the real issue is the lack of advanced privacy features.

Yeah I forgot to get into that further. I'll write something here and link it at the bottom of the piece.  
  
Basically, the first response is that speculators might decide that the chain with less hashpower is more valuable (depending on the change miners are attempting to implement). There is a strong incentive for miners to stick to the chain that pays more (has a higher token price).  
  
More profitable miners are also able to more easily increase their hashrate (all things being equal).  
  
If miners decide to be extremely malicious and ignore the greater profits to be made on the other chain (and attack that chain), then users can respond by changing Bitcoin's proof-of-work algorithm, which destroys the investments miners have made in their ASIC hardware.  
  
Even if a majority moves to the new chain, it's unclear if that chain is Bitcoin. What happens if the majority eventually decides to move back to the original chain for whatever reason? For example, should ETC be called ETH if it achieves a larger market cap and network hashrate than what we call ETH right now?

3. Says the market has rejected SegWit when I'm not sure of a major company/person/entity in Bitcoin that doesn't want it or is at least accepting of it (outside Roger Ver).

It seems pretty clear Satoshi was talking about transaction ordering throughout the entire white paper. This one passage near the end discuss _extending_ valid blocks and rejecting invalid ones; I'm not sure how you can vote on hard-forking changes to the consensus rules while only extending valid blocks.

It seems that bitcoin needs to be digital gold to offer more security to the network (increasing censorship resistance), and it needs to be censorship resistant in order to fulfill the digital gold use case. I used to think it was as simple as censorship-resistant payments providing the underlying value of the digital gold use case, but it seems that isn't the whole story. A hard fork that resulted in two chains could harm the perception of bitcoin as digital gold, which in turn makes it less secure (and less censorship resistant). It seems that the relationship is symbiotic. Would you agree with that assessment?

I agree with most, if not all, of that. But Bitcoin privacy is improving as less information regarding transactions is stored on the blockchain for everyone to see.

Miners don't have to make the first step. Full nodes can change the rules in unison with miners or without. Miners will mine on the chain that provides larger profits.  
  
Having said that, it's better if everyone hard forks together, which is why hard forks are hard.

The ironic thing is they're implementing a new solution that is supposed to limit their mining of empty blocks, and the testing of this solution is what is causing them to mine more empty blocks.

They would have someone mining the blocks. 100% of miners aren't going to stay with the current consensus rules if the vast majority of users want to change them. Even if that scenario that would never happen were the case, the users could mine the blocks themselves. Although, it would make sense to also change the PoW algo if 100% of miners aren't listening to the user's demands.

IBLT is on the Bitcoin Core roadmap.  
  
Miners set fees. They can choose to not accept transactions without their minimum fee. Long term effect on security seems unclear (at least to me), but Bitcoin not scaling via on-chain transactions seems clear (at least how it exists today).  
  
Blockstream did not create the LN. There are multiple other LN implementations in the works.

Coinbase does benefit from larger blocks (in theory). Full blocks are causing issues for their users (not the fees, just the fact that transactions don't get confirmed with the same level of ease they used to). It seems some wallets may need to improve their fee estimation mechanisms (not sure if Coinbase is one of these wallets as I don't use it).  
  
I still have respect for Brian and think Coinbase is an extremely valuable company for Bitcoin; however, his belief that the proposed Bitcoin Classic hard fork is an election leaves me scratching my head. If we are going to have elections for the rules of Bitcoin, we may as well just stick with fiat.

You are right that there would have been discussion on but it would have been between people who have no idea what they're talking about.

Don't think 4 MB is seen as safe today depending on who you talk to. That's why block propagation fixes are wanted first. SegWit in the meantime.  
  
Would love to see more info on Chinese miners getting around propagation issues with the methods jtoomim talked about at Scaling Bitcoin Hong Kong. Which pools are currently using this? Are there any tradeoffs to this tactic?  
  
discussed a current 5% orphan block rate for the 2nd to last mining pool to receive a block at the last DevCore workshop. Pieter Wuille also did tests on 20 MB blocks (that accounted for GFW) awhile back that seemed to show they'd be a bad idea. Those are the only other tests I remember right now.

In this case, he's attacking the idea of a contentious hard fork. I'm usually part of the "miners act rationally" camp, but think it's possible a miner would do this as a protest against contentious hard forks. There's a low probability of it happening, but it could still happen. Of course, none of this debate really matters anymore since a large percentage of hashing power has agreed to not hard fork without a 95 percent activation threshold.

I didn't think bitcoin could work due to a lack of intrinsic value when I first heard about it. Then I read more about the tech and realized censorship-resistant payments enabled by Bitcoin gave bitcoin its own form of "intrinsic" value. From then on I viewed it as a better version of gold.

The intrinsic value section should include provably fair gambling, illegal transactions, and proof-of-existence as examples of fundamental value/price floor.

1. Hyperledger, Eris Industries, Ripple, and similar platforms negate this point.

3. I agree with this point. It's not that far off from my previous comment though.  
  
4. I agree that bitcoin could eventually be used for retail transactions, but they have to have some form of underlying value (the use cases I mentioned in my previous comment) to get to that point. Many people may also not be putting their retail transactions on the blockchain.

These aren't the main use cases for bitcoin. Actual use cases are where bitcoin does something that traditional systems can't. Also, use of bitcoin in normal retail transactions is basically zero. If it was about retail transactions there wouldn't be much value to bitcoin (if any at all).

I'm a huge supporter of Bitcoin, but you have to understand how laughable this statement is right now. Why would anyone accept bitcoin as payment for goods/services when practically no one holds it? Essentially no one (in the grand scheme of things) is demanding this right now. Merchant adoption right now makes no sense. Focus should be placed on using Bitcoin to create new types of transactions that were not possible before the blockchain. All of this attention on the bitcoin price and merchant adoption needs to stop as it's really a waste of time/energy.

I don't get the point you're trying to make in regards to certain members of Core squashing any deviation from their plans. Gavin is the only contributor in the top 15 or so in commits (not that the metric means everything) who did not sign the Core scaling roadmap. The vast majority of devs (nearly all) prefer the Core scaling roadmap over Gavin's solutions; it's as simple as that.

It's actually not that bold of a claim. He's not talking about blockchains with a focus on decentralization. He's talking about the kind of blockchain that IBM is proposing to central banks. Instead of mining, new blocks are confirmed by "special" addresses, which are chosen in the genesis block.

I somewhat agree, and that's why I put "intrinsic value" in quotations. It's kind of a squirrely term. I would say that money usually needs to have some kind of commodity-esque value before it can become a medium of exchange though.

TBH, I wrote the article and find your comment more constructive than what's been upvoted to the top. I don't think it's helpful that some bitcoiners plug their ears whenever an attack scenario is presented. The -9 votes you've received is a testament to the circlejerk that is Having said that, I don't believe the kidnapping scenario you've laid out is a huge threat. Terrorists could also hold up PayPal and tell them to double spend a transaction, so I don't see the mining pools as a centralized point of failure. If any issues were identified at the pools, the miners would just move to another pool.

Alice is sending 1 BTC to a multisig address controlled by Alice and Bob. The refund transaction is required to make sure Alice gets her money back after a certain period of time in a situation where Bob disappears or just decides to be a jerk. Without the refund transaction, the bitcoin may just sit in the multisig address after Alice wishes to close the payment channel due to inactivity from Bob. Alice wouldn't be able to get her unused funds back because Bob's signature is also required in order to move funds from the multisig address.

When I first found out about bitcoin, I thought it was interesting but could not work because it was not backed by gold and lacked "intrinsic value." About a year later I realized certain features of the blockchain provide bitcoin with "intrinsic value" because bitcoin (or even just satoshis) is required to use the blockchain. That underlying value means that bitcoin can also be used for exchange. Some people may even hold bitcoin to exchange with someone else later. I think there is still a feeling that bitcoin is worthless or magical pixie dust that is created out of thin air. Many people don't see that being able to use the blockchain is the fundamental backing of bitcoin.  
  
Anyway, I think it is difficult to take the time to learn about all of the different aspects of Bitcoin (economics, technical understanding, cryptography, etc.). From what I've seen, the people who like Bitcoin are just nerds who had nothing better to do with their time at some point over the past few years and became fascinated by this new technology. Most people aren't willing to sit in front of their computers and chase their curiosity. Most people also don't really care how the Internet works, but they use it for hours on end on a daily basis.  
  
Sorry if these comments don't make much sense, just kind of spewed them out.  
  
Edit: My above comments cover the majority of people who dislike Bitcoin (I think), but there are also some skeptics who have honest criticisms about scalability or the ability to remain decentralized, which is healthy.

I agree with that above argument, but does it matter if the attacker can be stopped after one compromise? Couldn't he change the send to address and amount for the Ledger Wallet Nano to sign and then display bad info on the mobile app to steal the entire wallet balance?

Used to be somewhat interested in the decentralized approaches, but seems that it may be better to just allow people to hedge their bitcoins via smart contracts rather than creating new assets that could collapse and dissapear overnight if something goes wrong. These should not be viewed as money. These are derivatives, and the asset from which the "value" is derived is highly speculative. Remember, you're essentially holding BitShares, not US dollars.

David, you were posting on here about how ChainAnchor never had anything to do with Bitcoin. And you kept saying the same thing to me until I pointed to specific parts of the draft where applying it to Bitcoin is specifically explained.  
  
I'm not sure what the reason was, but it was misleading. That is clear for anyone to see.  
  
You did try to apply it to Bitcoin and decided against it. You and Thomas both told me this and it's in the article. I'm not sure how that's debatable.

Yes, mining will be competitive, but the threat of an outsider (bank, government, etc.) coming in with a bunch of ASICs to destroy the network grows larger. I'm more worried about that threat than mining becoming centralized organically.

The last line of the white paper is wrong -- at least if you interpret it in the way you're interpreting it. Miners will fork themselves off the network if full nodes don't also adopt a hard fork. It's more accurate with soft forks though.

I think Santori's take on it was interesting:  
  
"This will be important because, unlike state regulators, legislators have the power to create tax and other incentives to attract digital currency  businesses to their state. Regulators typically only have sticks, while legislators can offer carrots.  This could be a very good thing for the industry.

Just to clarify for those who don't actually read the article. Bitstamp does have a temporary solution for USD deposits. Better title for this post probably would have been "**One of Bitstamp's Intermediary** Banks Stopped Processing USD Deposits."

If you took away the block reward and the hashrate did not decline, then fees would be much higher (not sure if as much as $3). That seems to be Charles's point.

I was, but that may be a fair counterpoint in regard to the price drop since The DAO hack. Of course, Bitcoin wasn't hard-forked after Mt. Gox, so we'll have to see what effect that has too. The DAO was the first major smart contract on Ethereum, so it's a pretty different situation.

Didn't realize you were referring to 2010. I wasn't around for that. Those events aren't comparable. The Bitcoin bug was at the protocol level, and there was no expectation for the system to even work properly then. It was 2010. The DAO was promoted as unstoppable code, and Ethereum has been promoted as a platform for unstoppable dapps. The result of this hack is a more cautious approach to smart contracts, which is why Bitcoin's scripting language was limited in the first place.

Uncensored transactions vs uncensored forums is another bad analogy. Someone else's uncensored transactions don't affect me at all. I don't care why anyone is using Bitcoin. Someone else's uncensored posts with uncensored upvoting ruins a news portal (rbtc) for me.
