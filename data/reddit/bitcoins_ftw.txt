Obviously btcfor.com is your business as your history is littered with comments about them.  People of the interwebz would be much more likely to accept you if you didn't post things that were meant to look like you're a customer but instead you're the proprietor.
Why in the world would I put any type of transaction through with your company when you **cant even be bothered to use an https** connection on your site?  Who in their right mind would?  
If you want the trust of the bitcoin community, and want to grow your company/website, then you need to do it the right way.  **No EV SSL?  No type of secure badge(norton, verisign, esafe, etc.)? Not even a basic https?**  
No thanks.

I will use that link, in your shameless self-promotion :)

Not to sound discouraging or anything, however you do realize that there have already been a dozen or so sites that are selling gift-cards for BTC(mostly amazon, itunes, like you) who have been shut down within days, right?
They are very sketchy due to AML and KYC.  I wish you the best of luck, just giving you the heads up because many others have already tried **exactly** what you are doing and most are already shut down. (there are issues in exchanging one "currency" for another, and if a gift-card is considered "currency" then you **must** follow AML)
*Yes, there are a couple of these type sites still open, but of questionable integrity.*
