Coinbase gave me some shit the other day so I logged into my circle account and bought some BTC and within minutes already had it safely in my trezor wallet.
I will likely never use Coinbase again.

You basically have a bunch of numbers, and when you type them into the right place on you computer, you have control over a small piece of data. That data is visible to anyone that wants to see it. The data cannot be altered unless you do it. That is all you have, why would it be illegal??

oh, and then buy a cryptosteel and you'll feel confident about everything you have 
@_date: 2017-08-10 13:25:23
I have used both Ledger and Trezor many times to compare them. For me, the Trezor has always worked perfectly and offers a password protection layer as well as the pin, Ledger has been not as user friendly for me (I never use chrome). They Ledger also has very limited space on it and sometimes you have to remove certain coin apps to make room for others, you don't lose the coins though, they reappear when you re add the apps.
I prefer the UI, ease, and support of the Trezor 
@_date: 2016-06-06 17:42:34

@_date: 2017-08-06 16:13:15
people that only invest what they can afford to lose are the same people that work for someone else at a lame 9-5 job with a pinche 401k and pay rent to someone else who owns their house.
if you want to get ahead you gotta make strong moves, whatever it is. If it's Bitcoin or not. Stick your neck out for things you understand and believe in and you will always be rewarded.

exactly..3 months in BTC and an expert on it. yes this is an unprecedented attack by Bitcoin Jesus himself, it’s not the “lay of the land” lol. He forks the coin, gets free BCH and then tries to crush BTC by playing hashrate games and then adjusts the algorithm on BCH to suit him.

they were certainly not bought for over market price, and there was not a large bidding war..maybe 20 parties involved. A lot of people don’t want to own this coins. If you had some of those coins, how would you know they were SR coins? Do you have the tech to see that?

I was really plugging Bitcoin when it was below $300 (after $1200) and 90% of my peeps looked at me like I was speaking jibberish and could never comprehend anything other than their checkbook and credit card and the lame ass 401k this their employer had set up for them and the bonds they were putting their 5% (most people I know don’t even take that) thinking that someone else is making the best possible decisions for them and their finances... so fuking short sighted and blind. The few other folks would say “I won’t pay that much for that, it needs to come way down. Even tho it had just come down quite a bit. 
and honestly, I think most people don’t even have $1000 to invest in anything 
@_date: 2015-09-18 10:34:26
I thought these coins were stolen like last year tho..?
@_date: 2015-09-21 03:43:56

the price is currently near the high for the last year..so, technically it's not the best time to invest.

I think you mean "can't see these private keys"?
right? because coinbase owns them while they hold your coins..send out to another wallet and you'll have/own them
@_date: 2015-02-23 18:01:10

@_date: 2015-02-19 04:15:40
those Boones drankin, Miley fappin, trust fund havin' kids don't know who James Worthy, Stackhouse, Laettner or even Jordan even is...I doubt they even know what a Bitcoin is let alone know how it all works..their uncle pry told them to put it on their gay little sign...no homo
@_date: 2015-02-10 00:08:45
fontas has gotten very mentally ill from greed...I watched it happen...sad
@_date: 2015-02-09 00:27:56
it's too bad that when you handle Bitcoin, there's not some kind of public ledger or something so you can track it.
that article is kinda ridiculous and probably mostly made up
@_date: 2017-07-26 13:57:58
the volume there was $50 mill daily for many, many months 
@_date: 2017-07-28 13:59:59

I'm sure this guy would immediately see the tremendous potential that Bitcoin and the Blockchain technology represent
@_date: 2015-02-11 02:57:11
it was me, Karp and DPR...and I was like "I'm fucking out, I have a family"

@_date: 2015-02-19 18:22:33
those people will be using Bitcoin in 5 years whether they know it or not and whether they like it or not 
@_date: 2015-02-24 18:55:59
in 5 years people will be using Bitcoin for a lot of online stuff..moving value around..whether they know it or not and whether they like it or not..because the infrastructure will be in place and in use by all the major payment systems.
@_date: 2016-07-08 15:57:09

@_date: 2017-06-23 19:17:14

@_date: 2017-06-18 08:25:09
and they will educate you about how they don't give af about silly magic ponzi internet monies
@_date: 2015-02-24 04:29:01

just got one myself in Paris last week..they are not easy to get and I basically begged for one. started playing with it last night, pretty cool. I have had a Trezor for couple years and they are very similar. Trezor comes very sealed up and guaranteed tamper proof but Ledger does not..not sure why 
@_date: 2017-06-07 23:15:06
