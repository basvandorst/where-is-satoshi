Where's the Chinese boom? It's been days, no movement in the market that wasn't predictable, and we're on a downtrend set to be in the 80-105 region today, dependant on the wall breakdowns.
Even the Chinese exchange hasn't really seen any major change or fluctuation in price out of the norm..
Just saying people need to be wary about making trading decisions on news. So far the Chinese bubble hype remains hype, and we look set to be on the same correction that the 2011 bubble had, 3 month very slow downtrend with the usual daily up and down volatility that bitcoin always has.

Ditch the government. Use bitcoin.

You know what.... You're right.
or are the places to go.

Acting like an arse does not help your case.
Feudalism can't exist without centralised taxation, centralised taxation can not exist with bitcoin. Solution? Ditch government, use bitcoin.

A bit of theory here, by no means should this be taken by anyone as my opinion... You could consider it this way, this isn't theft from individuals, it's theft at the direct negligence of someone else. Thus everyone who had accounts drained won't actually lose their money, the banks are the losers here. So, ultimately the morality involved depends upon how you feel about taking from the banks.
Politically those in this very subreddit wishing for the fall of the banking system could view it as a moral right. Particularly if that money ends up in bitcoin.

He claimed to be Japanese. He was engaging just fine with people. He then abruptly stopped engaging when the tsunami occurred and was never heard from again.
Occam's razor.

I'd bet some BTC that probably has the best source of people capable enough to answer your question.
Phrase it with relation to your need/desire to preserve your bitcoin, but pose it with a view to gaining the necessary information to preserve anything and everything.
If they can preserve paper and other collectables permanently for years, they can preserve your shiny metal coin.
My best guess is full vacuum sealing with zero air to prevent possible air/water corrosion of any potential metals in it. What's it made from?

Borderlining a downward sell towards 80-90 again as it is, potentially an attack to induce it as people get back onto the market, people have historically panic sold from downtime, though the effect has lessened, presumably because people have wisened up to it being manipulation.

You keep telling yourself that. You're getting slaughtered by the votes and have an exceptionally minuscule number of supporters, compared with a massive number of vocal opposers. My comment is not incorrect.

I know right? Yet they'll all let you do it.
I smell a logical error going on here that needs explanation.

tl;dr: Don't bet against news. Bet against graphs. Graphs are reliable.

Still waiting for that chinese explosion. Did betting against the news go well for you? Expect today's low to be between 80 and 105.
Don't bet against news. Bet against the data.

The overwhelming debate occurring in this thread is against you, in support of the links staying.

Can someone explain to me how it's any more of a legal risk than serving the food in the venue in the first place?
You're liable if the guests at the conference get sick from it, you're liable if the homeless people get sick from it. I fail to see how there's any more risk of the homeless man getting sick from the food than the guests getting sick from the food.
