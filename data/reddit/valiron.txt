I do not pretend that it comes from spam bots. It could be some miners filling their blocks artificially (for example). You are right that "My wallet number of transactions per day" is quite volatile, but I smoothed it (5 days MA) and notice that no abrupt change happens at the end of June 2015, september 2015 but it does happen at the end of february 2016 so you may be right.

I do not understand your point. Persistent spam on the background is accounted for. The graph just show the variation of the proportion of "My wallet number of transactions per day"
@_date: 2016-04-04 00:49:24
So I computed the proportion of blockchain.info transactions vs the total number of transactions. There are spikes at the stress test at the end of june and beginning of september. And there is a spike now. 
This seems to show that the blocks are being filled on purpose.

As long as the adoption growth is exponential and viral, the boom-bust patterns repeat in a self-similar way. This is a universal robust behaviour of market prices. If the exponential growth stops (which will happen at some point) the model is no longer correct.

Some goldbugs make the same mistake: They hate bitcoin because they fear it. 
Bitcoin is like a gold meteorite crashing into the earth and making the gold price plummet. This is the only "catastrophe scenario" that most goldbugs could fear.
The truth is that bitcoin will moderate the increase of the price of gold since much money that would go to gold is diverted into bitoin. They are right to fear it. They are wrong to not purchase some bitcoins to cover their gold holdings.

To have a power of two number of transactions optimizes the computation of the Merkel tree of the transactions.

It is just a proportionality coefficient. The valuation is proportional to the number of usrs and inversely proportional to the number of bitcoins in existence. The coefficient was set at a time when the price of bitcoin was stable for several months.

Hard to estimate, but you are right. Even if they don't move there is the expectation that they may move, and this is factor into the price. 
@_date: 2014-08-19 10:08:02
The model is simple and given by the formula:
Valuation = (number of wallets in blockchain,info)/(number of bitcoins created) * 3019,3362
The justification is simple: The number of wallets in blockchain.info is a proxy for growth of users. Assuming that the wealth distribution of new users is the same as existing users (true in first aproximation), it is just a pigeonhole principle for the new money that gives the above formula for an objective valuation of bitcoin. 
Usually the above formula acts as a support for the price of bitcoin. The positive spread is the current hype...

@_date: 2015-01-26 18:46:55
Inflation, or base inflation, is defined as increase of the monetary base per year, in our case we measure the generation of bitcoins. The variation of price depends on market conditions and on demand vs. base inflation. On the long term bitcoin is deflationary since production is set to stop but use is expected to grow.
@_date: 2015-01-26 17:18:25

"I withdrew any claim. So, stop repeating the same thing over and over. Already Mr gmaxwell rated me as a scammer (at the same level as other people having stolen bitcoins to others) and has tried to bullshit my expertise, which I think at this point says more about him than about me. 
But I do believe and I will repeat that some unusual patterns do deserve attention, in particular when the numbers show that these events are extremely rare. 
Without being paranoic it is conceivable that some people found a boost on the mining performance (it wouldn't be the first time this happens), and they try to hide it for their own interest. 
I fully agree that this possibility has to be treated with caution, but it cannot be ignored and we should be on the look up. If this appears to be the case at the end, some people in this forum will have collaborated concealing this fact. They will bear that responsibility.

We don't know for sure which coins are lost and which ones are just dormant. We know precisely what is the total bitcoin monetary base created and we base the computation on this. Also "lost coins" is different from "coins not in circulation". 
If we assume that 10% of coins are lost, this just adds 11% to the inflation and we will be around 10% inflation. Not really "much higher".

I have given a lot of thought to this question, and after a careful analysis I am convinced that the economists don't understand the true nature of money and that this is the reason.
For example, you can find an article of Krugman stating that bitcoin has no intrinsic value. These economists are unable to distinguish between the abstract notion of money and its different representations.
Being a mathematician I am quite used to this type of misunderstanding. Abstract objects exist by their properties, not by concrete representations. This is very antiintuitive...but true.
What gives to bitcoin its intrinsic monetary value is all its good properties as money. The main property is that of being decentralizaed.
@_date: 2013-11-12 16:09:55
Here is my translation (I hope slightly better than google's)
Unstopable bitcoin
The bitcoin quotation has just broken the historical maximum of $266 from April, and has gone well over $300. It is now a good moment to review what happened in recent months.
During the previous highs in April and after the subsequent collapse, many voiced concerns and criticisms that should be reviewed now. They pointed out that the quotation was mere speculation, and that this was a bubble without any fundamentals. Some of the critics, even internationally renowned economists, did show a deep misunderstanding of the true nature of money, claiming that bitcoin was not backed by any tangible asset with “intrinsic value” (Translator note: Krugman for example). The truth is that money is backed by confidence, and does not require anything else. Today it is interesting to note that money, like gold or bitcoin, that is not controlled by central banks with opaque interests or governments overshadowed by corruption offers greater confidence. The return of the quotation to all time highs proves that bitcoin has an unsuspected strength, even more if we take into account the recents news.
First, we saw the pressure to regulate from the USA. Before the summer we witnessed something very similar to an institutional attack to companies operating with bitcoins, and in particular exchanges, where the quotation of bitcoin is established. On one side the FinCEN, federal organization that fights money laundering and promotes national security, urged them to register in a few months as money exchangers. Wire transfers were blocked to the main exchange MtGox. “Cease or desist” subpoenas were send by state authorities in New York and California to companies that work with bitcoin, and even the Bitcoin Foundation that only regulates the protocol.  Also in Europe the accounts of the exchange bitcoin24 were blocked. The coordination of these actions suggests that there is more than a mere desire of regulation. It is each more obvious that bitcoin represents a threat to fist currencies issued by states, and the US global economic hegemony is based on the dollar.
Also, a few weeks ago, the FBI did dismantle Silk Road, the encrypted web with an online drug market. This came after a laborious infiltration by FBI agents, and has led to the arrest of the founder of Silk Road and some narcotic dealers. It was thought that this would have a hard impact on bitcoin since all payments in Silk Road were using bitcoin. On a firs moment the quotation was affected, but immediately after the present rally started. This proved, against some beliefs, that bitcoin can live without Silk Road and the illegal trade. This also washed bitcoins face and showed that it was not just a currency invented to purchase drugs on the internet. Paradoxically, the FBI seems unable to seize the 600.000 bitcoin stash with a secret key controlled by the founder of Silk Road. That's another amazing fact: The seizure of funds is only possible with access to the secret key encrypting the electronic wallet, thus it is much harder than to seized funds in a bank account.
The bullish rally starts in China. After a couple of tv reports taking about bitcoin, the main chinese exchange has taken the world leadership in volume. New capital inflows and the rise of new users is propelling the quotation. The volatility is also returning. 
The main question is where we are heading from here. Clearly, if bitcoin establishes itself, as it seems, it will be worth thousands of dollars. We should remind that the number of bitcoins is limited (about 12 million now, among them several million seems to have been lost forever). There are more and more people into bitcoin once they realized that nobody controls it and that they can order instantaneous international wire transfers for free. This makes money transfer companies and the banking system obsolete. The volume of bitcoin transactions already approaches the one of Western Union and its capitalization is about 3.700 million dollars, which is comparable to Andorra's GDP and surpassing  that of many small countries. 
Bitcoin is too big to be ignored. But regulation is difficult, because is a new kind of money and it is delocalized. Many tax and financial questions have no simple answer.  Few economists and policiymakers do understand the technical side of bitcoin. It is likely that regulations will be delayed. But in the mean time bitcoin is growing much faster. The bitcoin threat to the traditional banking system announces a tough battle. It is increasingly difficult to convince sitizens of the needs of bank bailouts, especially when they realize that many of the services offered by the banks is given for free by bitcoin. We are at a point where there is the possibility that the ordinary citizen regains control of their money and their monetary freedom, ie the right to trade with a free currency. This has never happened before. We may be witnessing the first monetary revolution of humankind.

Obviously we want a decent deal. I don't mind if it is not the best as long as I can pay with bitcoins.

I am a big fan of Peter Schiff and it was very disappointing to me to hear him say that "...it's no better than a fiat currency..." in this video: 
He is clearly missing the point that bitcoin is decentralized and nobody controls it. IMHO he can be beaten easily in a debate just exploiting this point.
