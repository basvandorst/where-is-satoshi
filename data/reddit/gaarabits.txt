The 10 minutes aren't to be annoying. Even if they are for you.  
To propagate an information to all networks, all nodes, each entity, across the entire world: 10 minutes is very secure and proved it.  
This is an example of why 10min are necessary, but on the tech side, they are useful and needed for more stuff. And more the network expend, more we will need those 10min to get a perfect stable network.  
So this...  


  
...isn't valid at all, and not simple.  
The answer to your question: no.

Okay for tipping, not okay to assimilate this from the Dogecoin culture. For many reasons, I never goes to Dogecoin, including the false positivity.  
Bitcoin is unique, tips != dogecoin community, bitcoin != dogecoin.  
  
This list is stupid. The issue not coming from the other subs, but coming from the way that the tip is delivered (by a spammy message aka we should have a private option).

That is why we have services like BitPay. I think it's the point you're missing.  
Bank transfers have the same issue but with a larger timestamp, that why we have Mastercard and co. My SEPA can take 2-3 days. Mastercard is instant.    
  
I don't see the issue here as we have services behind.  
Even 1h to cross the world, user-to-user, with no taxes, while covering 100% of the network (blockchain), + top security, is pretty new.

@_date: 2014-05-30 06:25:02
Technically, any-who selling BTC is putting a downward pressure, including merchants.  
Customers putting upward pressure because they are buying.  
The difference is that sellers can't sell the BTC they don't have, while the buyer can buy to the death (or to the 21M). To sell you need to buy, it a 1-way.

A computer is a computer. Linux or not, storing an high amount on it, outside coldstorage, is just a bad idea. Keeping $20k of Bitcoin on your family desktop is like walking in Manhattan with $20k in your pocket.

Miners left them slowly. CEX/GHash did -almost- nothing compared to the other pools to prevent a 51÷. GHash was just saying that we should trust them, and CEX kept pushing propaganda.   
I'm happy they are down below the 25÷ *bow to the miners*, but I still not trusting them at all.

Not sure, cheaper electricity cost mean that miners will reach the ROI faster. Often, they are selling during the period they race to get funds back.  
But are they forced to sell when it's done ?
@_date: 2014-05-09 12:04:58


  
I can only be agree with you on this part.  
  
But we need an easier way to allow no tech peoples to do it. 'nodes', 'servers', 'relay', etc... are words that can scar some peoples.  
What we need is a cheap service that install and maintain the node for you. You'll just have to say to peoples: "if you participate, if we all participate, the transactions will be faster". This is not 100% exact, but straight and simple always work.
@_date: 2014-05-30 07:36:47

So I understand that TREZOR can be used for the Cold Storage. It seem the private key can be recovered with a seed.  But as a paper, if I lost it or break it, my BTC are gone (?).  
Please correct me if I'm wrong somewhere.  
What about the private key generation randomness ?  
Is the device protected with a password / 2fa or else ?  
Any details easy to understand for non techy ?
  
edit: it seem you can recover your wallet from an other Trezor device, just waiting for confirmation.

Only 30 countries in the world paying salaries over $1k per month. The rests are below.  
Even if $500 = $500 for all, they don't represent the same wealth for all. I don't know for USA, but for Bangladesh $500 can be 2 years of work.

Okay let's go for this !  
1. I like the design is simple, but the tickers (above the chart) are confusing on the prices.  
2. As you can mix pairs (great feature), you have tons of markets, but no way to get an overview. I think this is important for traders because they try to find profitable combination. My suggestion is the ability to replace the chatbox (and place it somewhere else) by a listing of all active markets, so you can insta now where to go.  
Keep the good work ;-)

Hi, French here, I'll try to summarize this.  
On the south of the France, cops closed a game/exchange platform. 3 guys got arrested in 3 different cities.  
**It's not because of the use of Bitcoin** but because of illegal money game (France have a big control on the money games) + dissimulated job (not declared) + illegal bank operations.  
388 Bitcoin got seized (200k euro).  
Between November 2013 and July 2014 they had a volume of 2500 BTC (+1M euro).  
Policeman that arrested the guys remind to peoples that Bitcoin is still not regulated in France.  
edit: they aren't saying it, but it's possible the guys got tracked with the banks operations.  
In France the government or police isn't spying your banks account, the banks doing this job. Many withdrawals + weird deposits then the banks report you.

It's not a weakness so far. 10min is maybe not fast enough for you, but if a day, 25-50% of the peoples on the world use Bitcoin, it's ensuring high security. No world-wild propagation can take less than a minute.  
  


  
You should check the Altcoin forums on Bitcointalk.  
To beat Bitcoin, you don't have to make a better protocol. You have to find more than $6.000.000.000 to beat the market cap, and more then 10k company accepting your coin, and create your coin ATM and sell them overseas, and, and ... good luck ;)

@_date: 2014-06-30 18:06:34
Let's resume:    
It's 63 bids for 10 stacks of 3k (except the last one, a bit lower).  
1 bid have 15.87% chance to win 1 stack (10 winners, 53 losers).  
  
When you bid, you don't know about the other bids, except if they are yours of course.  
  
Each bidders had to send a $200k for the participation, which is a pretty high amount of money.  
  
Speculate:  
A stack of 3k BTC, for $600 each have a value of $1.8M.  
For $500 each it's $1.5M.  
For $700 it's $2.1M.  
I'm just taking the numbers above as an example. I may be far of the reality: like anyone here, I have not even a clue.  
  
With 45 bidders, and 63 bids, it's 18 bids more than the number of bidders. We can suppose, maybe 10 of them did 2 bids, and some others did more.  
The bidders who put 2 bids are ready to spend (maybe) between 2x$1.5M=$3M and 2x$2.1M=$4.2M to get the Bitcoins.  
  
$3M to $4.2M is just heavy, we have big players who really want to win. I don't think they are engaging millions just 'to see'.  
As bidders don't know about the other bids, they are forced to bid above the average to get a stack and to be in the 10 firsts.  
  
The bidders who made 2 bids are probably using this strategy to get at least 1 stack (1 low bid, 1 high bid). If they win 2 stacks, they just will get an average (1 low + 1 high = 1 'medium'). Or they are just crazy bulls !  
  
My feeling with this auction, and with the few informations we have at the moment, is very bullish.  
I think the bids on $500, maybe less than $600, will lose. Let's wait and see !

Well, this survey can't work world-wild. As said in the example, in French we use male term for "the Bitcoin" (**un** Bitcoin), but we will use female terms for "the Cryptocurrencies" (**une** crypto-monnaie).  
It doesn't mean one is male and the other female. We don't have a term for the neutrality. So the male and female designation can be neutral in the kind of circumstance, even while using a male/female term, because we have no neutral word.  
In English you will say "I'm gonna meet a friend". But is the friend male or female ? In French, we say "un ami" or "une amie", in this case it's clear that you're going to meet a man or a woman.

These days, In France, the banks try to get you by offering 3-4% for 4-6 months if you leave you actual bank. They are fighting hard at the moment.  
Usually they are offering until 2.5-3.5% on locked account for X years.  
Most peoples think it's a good opportunity, but for me it look like more a bad signal meaning hyper inflation soon.  
And btw, it's a personal opinion, but for £40 more, you have better to work 2 or 3 hours more in the year instead of lock £4k.

Only a few crypto will win the war. Most peoples are maybe realizing that LTC have nothing really special to offer. DRK is technically really nice a deserve a good spot.  
If the DRK market cap isn't high as LTC market cap, it's because he is not on most big exchange.  
But if you look closely, you can see that DOGE is on almost all exchange, and is getting eat by DRK.  
Or maybe it's just a "pump", like the BC pump (up to 0.0009, and now down to 0.00018).

Yes they buy for around 1k, maybe less for some. But the thing is that the demand is 48k, and the FBI is selling only 30k by stacks of 3k.  
The demand is heavy just for this 1 company. How heavy the demand will be for the others ? If they want a spot, they have to bid high, or they'll lose. But lets see, Im maybe wrong indeed !

I don't understand why miners keep sticking on GHash.IO, they should be aware of the potential damage they can do. Can someone explain me the reason miners refuse to spread the hashrate ?

@_date: 2014-04-29 16:54:23
The whole OP mean they gonna dump on the current exchanges. Will they subscribe on Bitstamp or BTC-e to dump 200k coins to $100 ?  
They will be sell to companies because lot of them want to take position on this market and willing to buy. A lot would buy a part of this, as it's "hard" (or just not possible) for them to buy extra large amount.  
No companies are going to pump Bitcoin on the current exchanges. This is a great opportunity to buy that will probably never pop again..  
To conclude: this amount will not be sell on a stock-market.  
  
BTW:

But according to  peoples from Uganda get $2.41 per month.

Hi,  
Technically I don't know doing this, maybe it's impossible, I understand this can't be done so easily.  
I'm only suggesting because I think this kind of app/soft/or whatever could appkill the Bitcoin worldwide. This is because where in some countries peoples have no food, they still have mobile phones.  
  
Maybe this can be done with a centralized "SMS" and Bitcoin server, where you execute request from your mobile phone to a phone number (your server).  
If your server phone number is, let's say 1010101:  
 - The user Bitcoin address will be related to his mobile phone, so no cheat (&lt;phone number&gt; = &lt;bitcoin address&gt;)  
 - To send bitcoin to someone, you SMS on 1010101: "send 0.5 to &lt;phone number&gt;", the server will handle the request.  
 - To get your balance you can send to 1010101: "get balance", you'll receive back a SMS with your balance.  
 - etc ...  
Not sure I'm clear, it's just and idea, I'm not so Techy ;)
@_date: 2014-06-16 06:16:47

@_date: 2014-06-23 06:54:50
I'm pretty agree with your point of view, except that you forgot 1 very important factor: the time.  
  
The time is the reason making some big players not going for mining if they want a lot of BTC asap.

Words of someone who don't understand that work is still in progress. You don't build a tower in seconds, you need to build floor by floor, this require hands and work.  
Bitcoin not growing itself, it grow through a community and companies. We need more of them, it so require more time.  
I can understand peoples are hurry and want something right now, but I don't understand the capricious, they never helped.   
  
This guy forgot to mention that if Bitcoin is still hard to buy, it's not the Bitcoin fault, but the fiat fault:  
 - Long deposit arrival  
 - Banks pressure to the company in order to get customers details  
  
Yes it's difficult, you're right. But you're wrong accusing the Bitcoin for that.

If one big exchange (btc-e, bearstamp, bitfinex, maybe kraken and VoS) switch to 0% fee on trading, all the others may have to follow. This is because a lots of peoples will enjoy to grind on the 0% wave.

The bad thing with the anti-troll rule is that the definition of a troll is unclear.  
  
Some trolls are oblivious, but sometime peoples feel trolled when they aren't.  
  
With this kind of rule, peoples who feel trolled may start accusations.  
The troll rule counter itself as soon as some peoples are starting to debate if someone is trolling or not.  
As StarMaged indirectly said, this rule should exist, but shouldn't be public to avoid the snake biting its tail.

European here. And this ^  
Europe isn't really late in the adoption. "Small" merchant aren't interested at the moment, like a lot of merchants weren't 1-2 years ago in the USA. But big institutions are clearly looking into it. UK, Swiss, German, Sweden, maybe France soonish, they all already gave the signal.  
  
I think, like most technologies reaching the EU, we will have the "bomb" effect and when this will happen the adoption will be extremely fast.

Yeah sure, but this is still more safe, you'll not place so high amount of money on an unsafe place.  
I was mostly pointing the fact that lot of peoples think (or just don't mind) a computer, linked to the internet, isn't a safe place at all. Linux or not linux. I understand my examples were probably not the good ones.

You're misunderstanding the term "investment". Invest is not always buying, hold, wait then sell. It's also buying something to get able to build around it.  
  
For example you buy a farm to get a cornfield and sell the corn on the market. You invested into the farm, you intention was to build the cornfield through this farm and make money with your harvest.  
  
It seem that T.D. bought Bitcoin to build.
  
Here an excellent explanation of what investment mean if my example isn't clear:

I would avoid CEX-io, not because the service isn't good (they have a great service for sure), but only because they are dangerously feeding GHash.IO.  
Cryptsy is on of the oldest exchange, some peoples have issues with them, but they are good enough to me and always resolved issues.  
You can try Mintpal, the platform is very responsive, and they have a pretty good support service, but don't fall int the vote system, they are very tricky with it. They don't have fiat pairs though.

Indeed, I add that a volume (buy or sell) of 10k is a +20btc profit for them on a 0.2% trade fee ($4600 on the current rate).  
The Bitstamp volume on the last 12 hours is approx 30k, BTC-e 25k, Bitfinex 85k. It's a good day for the exchanges.  
  
edit: fixed volume.

I just not giving technical details if they don't asking for. If I enter too fast in these details most of peoples got bored or don't understand.  
What I do usually is:  
1. I show how fast payments are with Bitcoin (mozilla donation or buying stuff)  
2. I explain the coins are stored in my phone and I'm the master of them.  
3. I make them download Mycelium to tip them (&lt;- address creation)  
4. After the tip they ask what they can do with that. I show some stores, gamble sites and exchanges.  
  
They often coming back to me with more questions.

Of course the price matter, but it's not the Bitcoin health indicator, only a part of it.  
  
A market is never an eternal uptrend. If a market isn't going bearish after a bubble, it mean we are still in that bubble. You must be ready for this if you turn into a trader. 1 year is nothing.

Maybe it's your case, it's always the case of peoples watching only the price on the short term.

@_date: 2015-01-13 16:40:38
You're definitively right on this.  
Because Bitcoin is creating new traders (so young traders), for most of them the 'long-term' is below a year. They don't realize yet how slow is the process, and panicking when they think losing money.  
You were wise to hold. I just hope for you that you sold above $1000 for a wtf profit ^^ !

Quoting myself (yeah it's selfish)  


  
It's normal when things are going down after a spike.  
I mean ... if you break one of your personal record, tomorrow you'll try again and probably doing lesser. You'll need time and training to go above.  
  


  
If you think 'winning' is only about beating the price, keep in mind that 2 years ago 1btc was around $20.

It's not,  
Go here:   and click on 1w chart.  
On 3Jan2011 - 1btc = $0.5, then bubbled to +$20.  
End of 2011 - back down to $3.  
On Jan2013 - Price was around $15-20, ~2 year after the 2011 bubble, the all time high wasn't reached back.  
  
A cycle can take 1, 2, even 3 or more years.  
  
Be patient. It's when a lot of traders are losing faith and selling that the price going into a bubble, this process is slow and unpredictable.

Terrible what ?  
2014 was the best year of the Bitcoin life: many adoption, projects, fundings, etc ...  
2015 look very promising.  
You're one of those guys only watching the price, you don't care of the innovation and evolution.  
It's just too easy to say that we need more app and stuff because you just want the price to grow. Except trading, what was your participation in this ?  
@_date: 2015-01-13 17:03:24
It's not false, you're telling it yourself:  
  


  
6 months ago Europe bought an item to the USA for $1350. It was costing us 'only' €1000 for this item.  
Now the same item cost €1150. Try the same maths with the RUR.  
It's exactly the same with Bitcoin, but as you told, it's more visible.  
Lot of peoples feeling like losing money because for them BTC = $. But will they say that € = $ ?   
It's a paradox, you're not losing money, you just need to spend more.
@_date: 2015-01-05 20:00:19


  
I don't think this will happen this way really.
