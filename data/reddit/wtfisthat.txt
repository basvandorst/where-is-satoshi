There is. I know a lot of people who were interested who now aren't. Trust at the input/output stage is critical, and it hasn't just been damaged, it's actually been annihilated by this to outsiders.
I don't blame them. The hilarious thing is, unless there is some force of law (aka regulation of some sort), it's just going to keep happening.

It's one thing to express opinion. It's another to express it (for form one) for the sole purpose of self-gain at the expense of others. TBI leaked info on gox, but none of it was actually helpful: We weren't able to prevent anything, we weren't empowered by it. Instead what we got were a few suicides and a large number of hostility towards gox and, surprisingly, towards those who lost funds on gox. Hostility towards gox isn't helpful because it reduces their chances of cooperating with the community. Hostility towards community members who lost is just, well, disgusting and sociopathic.

What happens when the USB stick gets some bad sectors? This always happens over time. Are you using a self-correcting file system like ZFS? Are you backing up the USB stick and testing regularly? If not, you're going to lose your coins. Also make a paper copy of your private keys as well, and keep them in a safe. It's probably not a bad idea to move the funds to new cold wallets via offline transactions at regular intervals.

It also needs to be better than using a credit card.  That means insured purchases with no cost to the user, and potentially reversible.

We actually don't know about the solvency of gox.  We just know there are wallets, seeming associated with gox, that have lots of btc in them, but nothing is going in or out, including information.  Other than that, we have a lot of conjecture.  2bit is really an aptly named individual looking to gain exposure from the situation.  The facts are:  We don't know wtf is going on, and "Leaked documents from anonymous sources" are worth nothing.  The behavior of this area of the bitcoin community (aka redditis absolutely abhorrent.  I'll be glad once we have closure on this so I will feel less compelled to check this subreddit ever again.
@_date: 2014-02-28 17:55:39
Actually, the blockchain is a trail we can use.  We actually can mitigate the effect of this.  If it didn't happen at gox, I predict the next thing is going to be a professional heist to steal the wallets from another exchange.  If we were able to react to "freeze" the stolen assets by denying them at the exchanges, we could make theft of this type completely untenable.
@_date: 2014-03-01 04:50:49
No. According to a large number of responses I've seen here, they deserved exactly what they got.
I had no idea this section of the bitcoin community was so shitty.  Not having a reason for being part of it anymore alone is worth all the BTC I lost.
@_date: 2014-03-02 02:24:07
Some of the first responses I've seen in my inbox:






These are tamer representative of most of the responses I've seen, and seen directed at other victims, or as you put it before, "victims".
Rest assured, BTC and gox aren't forming my opinion of this community.
@_date: 2014-03-08 22:11:34
I'm not so sure.  Goods are goods. I think bitcoin qualifies. All you do is demonstrate to the court the bitcoins are something of finite supply and have value. It's pretty clear they are property, which means if they are stolen they become stolen property.
@_date: 2014-02-27 04:14:53
Those without coins definitely benefit if the gox coins are lost - throwing those who had coins on gox to the wolves in the process, so to speak.  Human nature is a double-edged sword.

@_date: 2014-03-04 08:04:26
Yes this is what I mean - it's not a bank, it's the "blockchain keeper" business. If the pace of transactions actually outpaces the growth of storage, then transaction fees will continuously go up. There is a finite limit to the number of transactions that can be stored.
@_date: 2014-02-27 11:49:09
Obviously it's true, because it's been linked in the internets.
@_date: 2014-03-02 17:56:56
Gox made enough money to have a team of military-gade mercs protect karpeles. But yeah, I'd say since october he has become one of the largest targets in the world.
Now, do criminals really want to acquire funds in a type of currency that can be tracked by every transaction? I think that's is an interesting question.
@_date: 2014-03-05 02:05:24
BTC is an experiment.

I'm waiting for closure, and I'm curious to find out what the blockchain tells us. I'm spending some large periods of time checking on the situation. I'm hopeful that something will work out. It won't ruin me if it doesn't. I get sick when I think of those for whom it will.
@_date: 2014-03-02 18:29:17
Oddly, I would feel better if the coins were lost forever than if they were stolen.
@_date: 2014-02-28 17:04:56
Maybe, maybe just parts of it.  The point it, we don't actually know the truth until everything settles.  Better to find out what reality is than to accept early conjecture.
@_date: 2014-02-28 19:37:39
I guess the point is that with BTC, you just trust no one.  I can't see it functioning as a monetary system without trustworthy institutions.  Exchange, for example, need to trustworthy (perhaps insured, or otherwise backed).  If this is done in pure BTC, that means the exchange has to be backed by a source of BTC as large as it's holdings.  That's one expensive insurance policy, because it has to have those reserves on day 1 or risk another serious breach.
The fundamental problem with BTC is not so much with BTC, but with the lack of a system around it to give people a feeling of safety.  I doesn't have some of the problems of the existing banking system, it also doesn't have any of the benefits.

All we need is to figure out which wallet address willy was using, and trace it through.
@_date: 2014-03-08 22:06:51
At least we have a public ledger showing us when, where, and how. I think we just keep tracking these coins until we identify which exchange(s) they end up at, then we might be able to notify authorities, as long as the country is friendly enough. I'm pretty sure that digital or not, coins are still goods, and these are stolen goods.
@_date: 2014-02-25 06:07:34
And those of us who chose gox some time ago but couldn't get funds out will simply shout "just stay away."
@_date: 2014-03-23 21:55:30
At the very least, once you can identify someone in the chain of stolen coins, you can initiate a discovery into the source of coins.  Gox just happened, so now is the best time to do this because it's unlikely many of the coins have been moved to be sold yet.
@_date: 2014-02-28 18:22:51
My likelihood of ever touching bitcoin again is about the same as recovering those gox coins.  I'm also going to tell others to stay away.  I don't see the value if this is representative of the type of problems that can be had.  I'll take slower transactions in a more protected/insured environment over this any time.
@_date: 2014-02-27 04:10:36
I'm sure he already is. However, if he gets investigated, the hopefully proper investigators will piece everything together and we'll get an accurate report.  The last thing I want to see if a leak or report from some blogger before that has taken place.
@_date: 2014-02-28 22:14:50
The wallet (or access to the wallet) itself is a private piece of data that can be lost.  Perhaps the keys are corrupted.  Somehow that would be better than having all those BTC actually stolen.
@_date: 2014-03-01 04:54:02
Of course, you won't be interested in all the numbers between 0 and 2^256, you'd just be interested in the prime numbers.
Also, there is always the possibility of exploiting the mechanism that generates the keys instead of attacking the keys themselves.
@_date: 2014-02-28 18:28:31
Can't the transaction history of a single wallet be traced back?  It should never take too long, unless you're trying to attack the system.  Perhaps a few years down the road it will take longer, but by then there will likely be some actual protection figured out.
@_date: 2014-02-28 17:47:50
The thieves wallets should be easy to track.  I wonder if they gained physical possession of the gox wallets - moved them to to USB and walked out the door.
I'm also wondering if it's an inside job or outside professionals.  I would not be surprised if it's outside professionals.  All the other exchanges should not accept BTC from those wallets, or BTC coming from those wallets, because those are "stolen assets".
@_date: 2014-03-01 00:36:22
Who said anything about reducing security.  I said something changed.  For all we know someone managed to find out where the key locations were and physically stole them.
@_date: 2014-03-05 02:02:15
Have they been shown to still be in gox's control (or otherwise not moved from those suspected gox wallets?).  It seems to me that when I look, there are leeching transactions moving those coins out.
@_date: 2014-02-28 18:11:24
There was an indication somewhere that the coins went missing in early February.  If this wasn't the case, than gox really was running a ponzi scheme.
@_date: 2014-02-27 03:40:08
Not only are the coins unspent, they are effectively lost, depending on how many bits long that key was...
@_date: 2014-03-02 02:19:11
Thanks for that insight. I obviously had no idea that I made the choices that led me to putting btc on gox and me losing all of them.  Good thing you pointed that out. Whew. I was worried that I didn't put my tinfoil hat on one day and the MK brain control ray got hold of me.  Maybe he used a magic card and put a spell on me, but now I know, it was just me.
"Not to be dick", indeed. You have no idea why I did what I did, or the research of decisions that led me down that path. You have no idea what my intentions were but you presume to tell me what I *should* have done. How many BTC did you lose, anyway?
@_date: 2014-02-27 00:33:53
Actually, the tier 1 limit was 100 BTC per day with no monthly limit.  I think teir 2 was 1000.

It doesn't.  But rage, and I mean **rage** is justified and expected.  Especially those of us who got into the exchange and got trapped.  All I ask is that you please don't make statements like:

@_date: 2014-02-28 18:33:58
Uh, I think we both just said pretty much the same thing.
@_date: 2014-03-08 22:25:16
I'm still not so sure. If someone other than gox has those keys, they could just be emulating the gox source code to make it look like gox is in control, but the reality is those funds are being transferred to other addresses. In any event, it seems something is going on, and if these transfers continue over the next several days, it could be an laundering attempt.
Unfortunately for those who are doing it, we're watching and recording every move. If only we had the addresses of all the other exchanges.
I'm half wondering if, whoever may be stealing these coins might not just set up a new exchange of their own, and everyone will flock to it and buy up all those stolen coins. We just need to keep tracking and recording these transactions.
@_date: 2014-03-08 22:07:54
Yes I was thinking the same thing: Just because it's returned by the gox API doesn't mean that gox is in control.
@_date: 2014-03-01 21:46:27
I'll stop posting when the closure if final.
For the rest, since it's apprently easy for me:
The next one is from you, and a bunch of others.  Oh, but those don't count do they?  Pointing out what I already know is oh-so-helpful, just keep doing it, don't just ignore it and understand that I've had a loss you can't comprehend.  You don't give two shits about it, and in fact seem to revel in that fact because you and many others keep having to point out that I lost because "it was my choice to put coins on gox".  No shit, dumbass.  Have any actual enlightment to share? No, I thought not.
@_date: 2014-02-28 18:10:17
You do the check on the basis of the history of the originating wallet.  Each deposit is checked against it's transaction.  Things like a new wallet with a small amount of BTC could trigger a check to see how it got it's BTC.  If it received some funds from a stolen wallet, that part of the deposit could be refused or confiscated for recovery.
We actually have all the BTC flow data, we actually can put together a system that is at least somewhat theft-proof.
@_date: 2014-02-28 03:16:29
This is my second try at suggesting this - it seems to be getting deleted every time I post it:
It could also be that there is some sort of investigation going on, gagging and freezing assets.  It might not have anything to do with keys, theft, etc.
@_date: 2014-02-28 02:07:33
I wonder if there is a change that it's not even a key issue.  Perhaps whatever legal stuff is going on requires him to freeze everything for the purposes of an investigation.  If that ends up being the case, I think it's possible those funds/BTC could be locked up for years.
@_date: 2014-03-01 01:34:14

You somehow think I don't realize what happened? I'm probably more acutely aware than you are. Calling people idiots, irresponsible, etc (all of which has been directed at me in my inbox and in response to posts) who have lost money is an attack.  Pointing out that they should not have used an exchange is pointless, you think we someone don't *realize* that? Seriously? And you think that constantly pointing it out (aka "well it's your fault so you got what you derserved") is *not* an attack?
This place is broken. Broken beyond hope.  I'll be curious to see where BTC ends up in a couple of years. My guess is that it will fade.  Hopefully something will learned from it and an actual proper digital currency will rise up.
@_date: 2014-02-28 21:57:52
Mt Gox isn't the problem. There's no trust in the system.  No exchanges are actually trust worthy. They don't have to adhere to standards or regulations. Anyone who exchanges money for BTC is taking a risk right now. Risk can be mitigated, but people are naive about the costs to do so. Also, why buy BTC to do something we can already do?  The only thing BTC is good for is borderless transfers.  For the rest, the existing system already handles everything better.
@_date: 2014-03-02 18:39:41


If not, I wonder if he could afford to now.  For his sake, it might not be a bad idea.
@_date: 2014-02-20 23:16:41
Gox was higher than other exchanges by about $100, not much.  Whether this was engineered or not, I don't know.  However, if they were up to some kind of scheme, they probably would have just disappeared with everyone's funds and bitcoins long ago.
@_date: 2014-02-28 17:59:17
You can still track the source wallets.  Sure, they can try to DDoS by wallet bouncing, but that would also make it obvious that something is fishy:  They would probably do the wallet bouncing over a short period of time, which would also be something that would be disallowed.  I don't see lots of separate wallets being an issue, because when you trace each individual wallet back, you'd still end up at gox.
@_date: 2014-03-08 22:28:45
We called him out on this earlier. He was promising a major leak of some kind and a few of us asked him not to: It would either do nothing or cause harm if he did, more likely the latter. He published anyway.

@_date: 2014-03-08 22:18:38
We can still can track and record the addresses. There is always a chain. There's a good chance that the overwhelming majority of the addresses are controlled by someone complicit. One day, at least one chain will have to hit an exchange, and the backtracing can begin. Even a billion-long chain can be backtracked by software with ease.
I suppose the blockchain itself doesn't need to store empty addresses, but I also don't think it culls itself. Even if it did, we can still record every transaction, starting now, going forward. These huge chunks from gox won't ever disappear.
@_date: 2014-02-27 08:38:48
If this mtgox thing doesn't somehow end up coming out ok, BTC is dead to me.  I'm sure it will be dead to many.  An interesting experiment that had run it's course.  I sure as fuck and not putting another penny into it.
@_date: 2014-02-27 01:27:54
No storage is free from bitrot. There is a reason you use mutliple, checksummed backups of important stuff.  I think it's just likely that, perhaps at some early point, the key got corrupted, then it got duplicated.  I imagine they have *most* of the key, but are now trying to figure out which part of it got corrupted so they can narrow the search for the correct key down to something reasonable (like, this year).  If they can determine which values in the key are bad, they can brute-force those parts until the wallet unlocks.  If it's just a few bytes in the middle, it wouldn't even take long.
@_date: 2014-02-27 07:12:53
Is your reporting going to change something that wouldn't change otherwise?  To me, it appears as though you are taking advantage of the situation to drive more traffic to your blog and get more advertising income.  I very much doubt you've had enough time to put the whole picture together.  Nothing you can report will be a positive for me.

Well, if Mark reads reddit, and is being truthful in this log (if the log is real), I'm pretty sure he's seriously consider calling it quits.
I hope this is valid though. Those of us who lost $ (or BTC?) could get a share of a new exchange, with new management who will hopefully do things properly.
What was that about having people follow MK around? An attempt at intimidation?
@_date: 2014-03-01 06:04:39
No, I said I can't spend BTC directly because of taxes.  It gets taxed as income in that case.  
My due diligence showed zero decent exchanges, save for one, and I tried that one first.  It was very non-responsive when I sent in my info, and moved very few BTC. I bit my lip and used gox. Outside of reddit, gox's reputation is much less clear cut. I was not using at that time, perhaps I wish I was, but that's history now. I have some left over BTC, but most are lost.
As for BTC ever making it to $10k, that sounds more like you're counting on a speculation play, not as the "money of the future".  In any event, there are many more reliable ways to make a fortune out there. I imagine there will be several involving freeing BTC from current holders too. Good luck with your bits.
@_date: 2014-03-04 01:51:37
I'm wondering of the blockchain strategy will work out in terms of storage.  Anyone notice how the block chain size grew 4x over the last couple years?  Storage isn't growing at that rate.  Should BTC grow to the point where there are many, many more transactions per second than there are now, this could balloon up to where the only viable place to store it and maintain it (because of massive I/O volume) would be in datacenters.
Eventually it will catch up with the storage solution of the day, and we may be forced into using a new type of "blockchain" institution instead of a bank. Sure, we'd control our private keys, but we'd be trusting the blockchain itself to some big players.
@_date: 2014-02-28 19:24:30
Actually, this is representative of what's going to happen to your average person.  BTC cannot go mainstream until people can use it without having to worry about wallets, self-protection, cold-storage, etc.
Really, I have nothing to worry about. I lost money betting on a bubble. My bad. It happens.
@_date: 2014-02-28 18:40:56

@_date: 2014-02-28 18:29:44
You implying that those who put BTC on gox were irresponsible? That's a pretty toxic attitude to have if so. Why shouldn't it be possible to exchange BTC for other currencies?  Should BTC just be kept in cold storage forever?  That would limit it's usefulness.  How do you handle investments? How does one have a "bank account"?
I wonder how much of the general population will agree with this sentiment.
@_date: 2014-02-25 18:20:26
I learned that I've now exited the BTC market, unless something drastic changes.  If MtGox is really gone, I'm going to emphatically recommend that others stay away as well.

If so, those who may have lost BTC will have grounds to sue him I think - though it would be a real fight to get through the LLC.

Ha! No kidding!
I can actually see that once people start to expect to have things such as protections on their account/deposits/whatever, the BTC world is going to look no different from the one we have with real money, save for certain faster transactions in certain situations.
@_date: 2014-02-27 00:40:37
You might need some scalable way to gather this data, I don't think doing it here will do the trick.  Perhaps an online form/database that is anonymous will do the trick, where people can create prehaps secondary reddit accounts as a contact points, therefore better protecting their identity.
@_date: 2014-02-28 18:44:21
You can certainly print the bits of the wallet to paper, and reconstitute them elsewhere.  Don't lose the paper.  Don't let too many copies out, either.  It seems far too risky to me.  Certainly less risk if there is an organization out there to manage that part of it, let's call this organization a "bank".
@_date: 2014-02-27 03:59:04
Well, I'm hopeful we'll come up with something, otherwise me and probably many others will be cut out of the BTC community, and will henceforth regard it as toxic and will never return.

Nothing.  There's also nothing to stop them from being "robbed" by other means.  Honestly, there is no safe way to actually move between real currency and BTC.  Even meeting someone personally carries risk: They could just rob you of your BTC on the spot.  Once you have BTC, there are ways to keep it tucked away, being your own bank (or vault, actually).
Probably the safest way is to use a local exchange business, of which there are several, to exchange small amounts of BTC. At least, in the case of a scam, you'll have an address to point to.

It's far easier to publish a story, *thinking* you have the whole story, but actually not, than to wait for verification.
I hope whatever he publishes truly is the whole story, and is completely accurate.  People are going to react.  If they react in a very bad way, and it turns out the story is not complete or accurate, it could ruin any chance of recovery.  We already know there is a serious issue.  Having presumably lost BTC myself, I want to see that every effort has been made the recover them.  I have no interest in seeing some story from an insider - it won't help me get those BTC back.
@_date: 2014-02-27 00:37:45
There would be little point to hanging in there if that was the case.
Either he lost the keys to decrypt the wallet, or the storage system the wallet was on failed, and the backup failed or didn't exist.  I'd be willing to bet that's the case.  If it is, it means that all those who had BTC on gox just had their value to transferred to all those whose BTC were not on gox (due to a loss of 1 in 6 of all bitcoins), so they can LOL at those who lost while they gained.  The funny thing about that is, if the commnuity did bail out those who lost, everyone would have the same value in BTC in the end anyway.  Organizations like governments would probably also be terrified by such as massive show of solidarity.
@_date: 2014-02-19 23:34:23
I imagine they have taken money from some people that may not be the kind of people you want to take money from.  I think people at Gox will create a dangerous environment for themselves should they try to defraud their customers.
That said, as long as they don't defraud the dangerous ones, it could turn out badly for the rest.
@_date: 2014-03-08 22:13:31
Anyone in possession of the private keys to that wallet can affect withdrawals from it. That could be MK, or someone he knows/trusts, or someone else who got possession of the keys.
@_date: 2014-03-02 18:17:55
Bitcoin is inherently more traceable than real currency. The effects of this on anonymity are unclear, but it *should* remain anonymous enough as long as you don't connect yourself to a wallet. However, in the internet age I don't think that can happen.  I think this is the real reason why several western governments are actually looking at BTC (and perhaps why Russia and China gov'ts don't want to).  Be a real bitch to fund the NSA with BTC though.

Sticking to one line is not the answer.  Just patience and a concept of "long game" is the answer.

I can't wait until someone puts together a visualization tool that displays the transaction chain through wallets. I might be illuminating, and would look pretty cool.

I find it hard to believe that there are any good exchanges. They are too new - it takes time to find out how well their systems hold up.  Are they truely theft-proof?  BTC has it's work cut out for it:  It's up against our existing financial system, which is something that has been refined by a large number of smart people over thousands of years.  I highly doubt that the creators of BTC are somehow smarter.  It seems to me that BTC is much like gold back in medieval times, before the scrip.  You walked around with a little gold, and kept the rest in a safe place.  Here we are, with a global network, able to communicate at the speed of light, and yet now we have to keep our wallets in cold storage somewhere (obviously, not on our cell phones) and bring out small amounts of BTC for spending.  No banks. No interest accounts. None of that stuff exists and/or is trustworthy.  How many of the exchanges here are backed by full liability coverage?  I'd really like to know.  Exchanges are the entry point for the mass market to BTC.  No trusted exchanges mean no trustworthy entrance.  Maybe, if that changes one day, I don't do my best to keep people away. But until then, it's the *least* I could do for them.  BTC is way way way too early for the average person.
Aside from that, the attack-the-victim mentality here (seems to be mainly on is a complete abortion.  If for nothing else, that is enough reason for me to steer people away.

Good article, but doesn't do the maths IMO.  It's just too many coins. I think it's more likely that the BTC loss was not theft, but perhaps bad key management and corrupt storage.  Perhaps MK left his master key on a usb stick in starbucks. 
@_date: 2014-03-02 18:57:29
I think what libertarianism really is is "regulation by the people". Basically, business can operate however it sees fit, but if it screws up, people notice and the business fails. It gets more complicated because people put together groups that are responsible for determining the trust of businesses within a certain market segment (ordinary people don't have the capacity to do this anymore - too many markets, too many businesses). The consumer groups would be able to provide information to the public about who to trust.
The ironic thing is, the ultimate model is similar to the one we have, except that consumer groups are expected to rise organically by direct organization of the people vs organized by a government as a proxy for the people.

Trust is irrelevant once you've won.
@_date: 2014-02-27 11:44:13
In the event that MK actually got away with all the coins (which I don't think is the case), I'm not sure if the LLC protects him from having to give them back in civil suits.  I'm not sure what a conviction of fraud would do either.
@_date: 2014-03-05 00:01:40
Member-owned is still run by a small group of appointed, hopefully trustworthy people.
It also assumes that the members will make the best possible decisions, and this is definitely not the case. Groups of people can be very dumb.

Ah yes, very good point. Fraud is fraud, at the end of the day. Defraud a  company, and it can go after you, since apparently companies are people-like entities. So it's indirect, but it should still work.
@_date: 2014-02-28 18:56:06
See, when you look at exchange options, you also look at things like where is it?  Can I get money out of it? etc. BTC-e and BTC-china or no-goes because neither of them are in a trustworthy country.  Other exchanges are too new to have any type of reputation.  A lack of reputation is NOT a substitute for a good one.  At the end of the day, gox was the oldest exchange in a friendly country that could transfer money internationally, so no, it's not clear-cut.
Now, what about those who just had very bad timing?  I put BTC on gox and shortly afterwards transactions were frozen. I got trapped. I had my BTC in cold storage for quite some time, and within weeks of getting out in the open, it all gets locked up, then stolen. Then some know-it-all douchbag on the internet calls me irresponsible.
@_date: 2014-02-28 17:44:13
This may sound like a simple thing, but really it's not.  Is your cold storage backed up redundantly and checksummed? If not, your wallet is going to get corrupted one day.
Also, as far as I can tell, all the exchanges could be dodgy.
@_date: 2014-02-20 23:47:38
I think it might be too early to tell.  Fixes like this aren't usually things you just deploy overnight. Often they can take weeks or more.

The best part about these audits is that they show 100% of the coins - until they don't anymore and your funds are gone.
@_date: 2014-03-02 02:55:42
I think this might go further. I have a friend in finance saying that their firm has pulled back from BTC. Not sure if they were affected by Gox.
Speculators are what helped elevate the price, I think there is a good chance future ones won't be so bullish after this.

At least we get the closure of knowing that our coins ended up at an exchange, and therefore were definitely stolen to begin with.

I have my doubts about that, but we'll see.
@_date: 2014-03-23 00:38:34
I'd rather see the potential of such as thing be an inducement to ensure maximum effort is put into some kind of recovery, and the discourage bolting.

If all gox customers were to submit the addresses they used to send btc to gox, and you looked for the most common addresses showing up in all those transaction chains, you'd probably find all the gox addresses easily.

That's true, but then we end up with trusting institutions as custodians of the blockchain. That *may* lead to problems if the number of institutions is low and they decide to cooperate (and they will).
@_date: 2014-02-27 03:49:20
Please reconsider breaking whatever story you have.  It will, at best, do nothing, and at worse, hurt those of us who have lost significantly amounts of BTC by ensuring that any chance of recovery vanishes forever.  While you may have good sources, you may still not have the full story as you think you do.  You will trigger rage, and given the amount of money some have invested, you'll trigger some much more serious reactions.  I get that you make a living on your blog, and would love the traffic, but please don't take a chance at hurting so many others in the process.
@_date: 2014-02-28 18:05:45
As it should.
@_date: 2014-02-28 18:04:27
Isn't a "free market" regulated by the community instead of a government body?  If you think we don't need the concept of regulation, you're definitely mistaken.  Do you want complete anarchy?
Not really.  With bitcoins this could be a very fast process.  If you pay with a stolen $20, it can be tracked, it's just not digital so it's a slow process.  Pay with bitcoin, the payment gate just has to back-check the transactions from your wallet to see if it originated from a stolen one (or if some of the funds came from a stolen one).  It you assume that the stolen funds are spent last, then once you get down to the stolen amount in your wallet, the payment is declined.
But you don't need to get to that stage if it's impossible to move stolen assets anywhere on the network in the first place, which require community cooperation.
@_date: 2014-03-01 01:21:51
All exchanges need to do this.
@_date: 2014-03-02 02:48:20
BTC is money because it is a trade facilitator that a large enough group of people consider to have value. You can receive it as payment, and use that payment to buy goods from a (so far limited) number of suppliers.
@_date: 2014-02-28 22:25:06
I guess if someone were to get the wallets' private keys, and managed to delete gox's copies, then there would be no need to transfer those btc.

The rational side of me is still waiting for all the details to come out.  I hope everyone does the same.  I would hate for something to happen, but then it turns out that some or all of this is a hoax.

Andreas thinks they weren't really cold.  Anecdotes aren't helpful.  Facts are.  No one seems to actually have facts, or at least verifiable ones.
@_date: 2014-03-02 22:24:40
There is also the possibility that MK himself is under investigation for something, independently of gox.
Regardless of whatever happened, I want to find out the truth. I'm hanging in there (here) until it's all revealed.  I also find the blockchain analysis really fascinating - we have a system with complete visibility into all the accounts, and by definition it always must be true and up to date. I've said somewhere before that governments would absolutely *love* bitcoin, as once they put a name to an account, they can track money flow forever more.
Now the other thing I find very interesting is that criminals DO NOT WANT to use bitcoin. Once one wallet is compromised, it's easy to trace the money trail. Same thing applies with terrorism - just have the Marines or Seals find one wallet, and you can back-track it through the addresses.  It can never be hidden or erased, therefore every miscreant now using bitcoin will have an increasing chance of being exposed as time goes on.
I know there are attacks that are DDoS-like in nature, but they don't even matter.  They will slow the analysis process, but they can't stop it, nor can they erase or change history.
I'm almost starting to wonder if the BTC authors had secret-service or intelligence connections or influences...
@_date: 2014-02-28 18:15:29
The check would be near-instant almost all the time.  The blockchain is there.  The transaction history is there.  Again, if you stop theft at the exchanges, there should almost never be a case where people come into possession of stolen BTC.
@_date: 2014-02-28 19:51:55
Perhaps. However, these are extremely expensive growing pains to have. Eveyone here says BTC will endure. I see this type of stuff as eroding. The mentality of attacking victims here is the nail in the coffin. Being here and seeing it take place is like watching that BBC documentary where the chimpanzees attack, murder, and eat each other.
@_date: 2014-03-01 04:31:08
Last I checked those two weren't options for converting to FIAT.
BTC was a cute experiment for me. Never touching it again. I'm going to give a private presentation on it soon, so I'll make sure people are well aware of it's shortcomings, and the shortcomings of the community around it.
@_date: 2014-02-25 06:38:10

@_date: 2014-03-02 03:05:57
There were operations using GPUs to generate thousands of coins per day. Too bad deposits don't have time stamps.
@_date: 2014-02-25 06:28:11
It's truthfulness doesn't mean it's something helpful to point out.  How many coins did you lose?
@_date: 2014-04-09 03:01:11
I agree. It would not be easy for him to obscond with such a massive amount of BTC anymore - people care, people pay attention, and there is infrastructure we can easily tap into - anyone can write against the blockchain.info API, and more importantly, anyone can parse the blockchain on their own PC. He knows he will get found out. Also, anyone "stealing" the btc knows they will leave a trail. The blockchain never goes away, so time is on our side, not theirs. I honestly think he's trying to recover this somehow.
@_date: 2014-03-02 18:12:55
I interpreted what he says as speculation. The takeaway is we are identifying wallets that contain large numbers of BTC, and those appear to be gox's wallets. We don't know who has the keys, if anyone.
@_date: 2014-02-28 19:21:32
Actually, I gave bits of data to an exchange.  There were tax reasons for doing this.  There wasn't another exchange that was a better choice at the time:  They are all shit in one way or another.  I could have just held the coins and done nothing with them too.  Spending them is not an option where I am, because they are immediately taxed as income, despite the investment required to acquire them.
I can see now how, for the average person, BTC offers pretty much nothing of value.  It will require external protections and guarantees be added before the mainstream will adopt it.  Transactions will become more costly, and probably start to resemble the system we already have.  BTC will have a property of not being government backed, which isn't necessarily a good thing.
@_date: 2014-02-21 03:51:56
If, after all this time, no one was able to withdraw, it seems to me that gox should have failed long ago.  However, people have been getting money out, after a few months.
Also, my understanding is that they halted fiat before, and it has now resumed.  They have currently halted bitcoin withdrawals.
@_date: 2014-03-02 03:00:53
Perhaps it's an internal test, and the source is another internal gox wallet.
@_date: 2014-02-28 19:05:26
I wouldn't be completely dismissive of the concept of bitcoin.  I think if it (by "it" I don't mean our current bitcoin, but some other altcoin) innovates and actually learns something from our existing financial systems but does bring the main benefit that bitcoin supposedly offers (fast transactions anywhere in the world), then it could ride this wave of sentiment people have for, "unbound" money (I say unbound because it's not associated with a government body) and actually innovate.  Most money in the world is digital already, which I don't think most people realize.  I see a lot more general appeal in a self-regulating altcoin.
@_date: 2014-02-28 18:49:52
BTC is the criminal's choice, it is not?  In that case prosecution is the least of his worries.
@_date: 2014-02-28 22:19:55
I'd say that word got out that there was a thing to invest in, and speculators flooded in to make quick cash.  It's not sustainable until some accountability is put in place. 
As to what I'm doing here is learning.  I've learned a lot since I found this sub. Too bad I only found it in the last couple weeks.
