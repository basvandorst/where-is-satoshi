Well that's a very positive way of looking at it :D
@_date: 2018-01-16 01:28:08
Keep digging that hole 
@_date: 2018-01-29 21:11:43
@_date: 2018-01-15 22:10:37
Because it'll never be used as much.   Bitcoin fees would be super low if nobody used it as well ;)    
But we have Lightning (enabled by that pesky Segwit thing you guys chose to purge, ooops!) so fees aren't going to be an issue, for us.   What do you guys have in the works again, in your very robust and thorough roadmap built by your many, many, talented developers?  Oh wait...
@_date: 2018-01-29 22:10:36
Haha, you're too much fun :D
@_date: 2018-01-29 10:21:56
@_date: 2018-01-24 07:03:26
Honestly, I think it's just time to move on and use a different site.  These guys can no longer be trusted, so don't give them any more traffic.
@_date: 2019-07-04 20:49:05
This and the Tulip Trust document forgery is just hilarious, this guy is clearly a scammer, but he's also a *terrible* scammer which is the funniest part. He's publicly outing himself in an expensive court case for everyone to watch!
I love it Craig, keep being you (a huge twat).
@_date: 2018-01-15 22:36:59
Haha, great research there buddy, keep it up :D
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:31:45
Yep, good call
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:20:02
Hah, SaltyVer is going to love this :)  
@_date: 2017-12-01 11:02:45
Yeah look I don't blame you at all.  It's hard for me to respond in a way that I feel would convince you to be honest, because I have the benefit of 7 years of knowledge about this stuff and as a newcomer I can only imagine what all this nonsense must look like.  I could attempt to explain why Bitcoin Cash has no future, but you'd likely be fed something similar from someone from the other sub and ultimately you'd be no better off.
My only advice (if you are actually interested in getting a clearer picture, and again I can understand if you're not) is to go do some reading elsewhere (outside of reddit completely).   If nothing else I think you'll find that the people on Bitcoins "side" are some of the smartest, most well respected people in the space, and I'd hope you'd be able to trust what they have to say a little better than the randoms on Reddit, both subs included, and myself included.
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:59:38


Well then maybe they shouldn't have purged Segwit hey.  Good luck getting Lightning working otherwise (regardless of not having an ounce of dev skills in the entire bcash project obviously) :)
@_date: 2017-12-01 02:46:54
The worst thing about all this is that all those people in that sub, new to Bitcoin, are going to see the back and forth between us and the bcashers and just nope the hell away from both.    It's a huge mess in that sub right now, and not conducive at all to getting new people interested.
Hell if I were new to Bitcoin and popped my head in that sub, I'd roll my eyes at all the kids arguing and never look at Bitcoin again.

"If bitcoin is below $50,000 on Dec. 28, 2018, the options will expire worthless, and the $1 million will be lost. If bitcoin rises above that level, the options will give their owners the right to buy 275 bitcoins for $50,000 apiece."

I'll put forward the Bitcoin Core Community Support address:  3FkenCiXpSLqD8L79intRNXUgjRoH9sjXa
Bottom of the page (linking to the network support page as you should do that too):  
Obviously not a charity for sick kids, cancer, Alzheimers or any number of other worthy options, but without the myriad of Core developers around the world we wouldn't even be having this conversation.
Right now their donation address has had a total of 0.20 Bitcoin sent to it, which is a pretty crappy effort :D

What the hell is "Binance Coin"?  Whatever, its a live Bitcoin auction.

Not a live auction though. 
@_date: 2017-08-07 22:31:23


Eric, it's never going to happen.  Segwit is what people wanted, and we have that now.  There's zero need for 2x, and you have to know it's got bugger all chance of getting across the line now, ESPECIALLY after Bcash.
@_date: 2017-08-08 06:06:35
That's fine, it's a good idea.
@_date: 2017-08-08 01:39:10
It's really a shame we've gotten to this point.  Bitcoin as a concept is obviously amazing, but it's sad (although inevitable I suppose) that "big business" had to come along and try and rip it away and pervert it.
Well, they can't have it.  As long as people like yourself and (what I consider as) the other white hat devs keep doing their thing, I'm confident we'll be fine.   
@_date: 2017-08-18 02:33:07
Two images of the number of authors and number of commits of the btc1 repo and the Bitcoin repo over the last month.
btc1 had 2 people contribute 4 commits in the last month.
Bitcoin has 27 people contribute 109 commits in the last month.
@_date: 2017-08-18 01:56:22
Basically the last part of my OP.  If there are insufficient developers (both in skill and numbers), a game breaking bug could *easily* slip through and cause chaos.  It'll just take one bug that loses money to bring the whole thing down as no-one will trust the software anymore.
This is a $70Billion network now, it needs all the care and attention possible.  If all the core devs (which is essentially, all the devs) leave then we're down to just a few inexperienced ones and it's pretty clear that's a bad thing ;)
@_date: 2017-08-08 20:33:27
Well, you don't have to be Einstein to notice the pattern in this thread (and just around Bitcoin in general).  People with no technical knowledge whatsoever just lapping up what the 2x/bitCash tell them without having the ability to actually read and understand the code or discussions around it.   It's just creating white noise and getting in the way.
If you don't possess the ability to comprehend the changes being made in pull requests like this, then you should not be contributing to the discussion.  This pull is a benefit to BOTH sides/coins!  Without it your 2x coin will be in worse shape come launch.  Stop arguing against a positive just because someone you blindly follow says so.  
@_date: 2017-08-08 08:29:45
No, those "many companies" boil down to ownership by a single entity.
@_date: 2017-08-08 03:02:11
I'm sure they're putting their new covert asicboost code to good use, now that they forked the disabling parts out obviously :D
I'm only half serious there, but before you jump on me with various comments around tin foil hats, it's a sad state of affairs that my silly comment needed to be said at all and is, in all actuality, probably quite likely.
@_date: 2017-08-12 08:43:43


Wait, do you have a link to that?
@_date: 2017-08-18 09:19:14
Ok, will do, although they all seem to be about bcash over there so I'm not sure they'll care about b2x in the first place to be honest :)
@_date: 2017-08-18 02:48:42
Not sure, I'm on my phone and that'd take some fiddling to work out.  Happy for you to tell me though if you've time ��
@_date: 2017-08-08 20:20:20
Nope, you're fine 
@_date: 2017-08-08 08:27:01
Oh for goodness sake, just use your own brain for once instead of blindly believing what you're told about the big bad core developers.
It's right there in front of you if you just take the time to comprehend it for yourself.  
@_date: 2017-08-18 02:21:08
This illustrates things perfectly:
@_date: 2017-08-18 01:53:50
Let's not get derailled by who's right and who's wrong in this thread if possible.   Both sides/implementations will be affected by a lack of developers.
@_date: 2017-08-18 02:55:35
Not sure, that'd take some fiddling to work out, and I'm on my phone.  Happy for you to tell me though ��
@_date: 2017-08-08 20:23:53
No-one is running it yet, it's not released.  Some (a majority of the list are owned by one entity) signalled for it back before Segwit was actually locked in (and before bitCash appeared which gives the people who want bigger blocks, bigger blocks), but now that's happened there's zero need for 2x it's likely that far less (those not under that single entity, and likely some that are) will actually run the software if it ever makes it to a safe usable state (which is a question in itself).
@_date: 2017-08-18 02:45:38
It's forked from the Bitcoin repo so the majority of those commits came across from there.  I believe it was around April, so anything before that is just Bitcoin.
As for measuring code quality, we do that by testing and reviewing, but if there are only 2 contributing developers then who's doing the testing and reviewing (the crux of my point).
@_date: 2017-08-02 21:34:03
No you were right the first time, it's Bcash.  Bitcoin doesn't belong in the name.
@_date: 2017-08-18 01:51:40
Bitcoin crashes and burns, everyone loses.
@_date: 2017-08-17 23:42:00
I just hope it's being considered and planned for, by both sides. It'd be really easy for the b2x team to shrug this off with a false sense of superiority ("we think we're amazing coders and everything will be fine").  Even if that were the case, it's not only about talent (though that's a big plus obviously).  You can never have too many testers, checkers and opinions in a project this size and this complicated, and if the majority of the people leaving also are the ones with the most experience with this particular code then this is just objectively bad all round.
@_date: 2017-08-17 23:44:38
Look I obviously agree, but I also think it's prudent to have this conversation just in case the worst should happen.
Without getting too tinfoil hatty, the bad actors involved in this split have a lot of money to throw around, and in this space money equals support (people will do a lot for a chunk of cash) and it also means hashpower.
Once again, I'm hopeful it won't go ahead as it's just an all round bad idea for everyone, but just in case.....
@_date: 2017-08-08 20:26:20
Firstly, it's unnecessary (Segwit solves this issue for now),
Secondly, it's an unsafe, rushed implementation with inadequate dev support and inadequate testing,
Thirdly, it's not double, it's considerably more than that (see point 2)
@_date: 2017-08-18 00:18:00
I was perhaps being a bit diplomatic when using the word team, I'm conscious that if this were to become an issue, it'd be an issue that would affect the entire Bitcoin user base so I'm doing my best not to exclude the other side or give them a reason to shrug this off.
You're right of course, it's an extremely limited pool of knowledge and that's probably the scariest part of this whole thing.
@_date: 2017-08-08 20:29:06
Seriously?  The core devs makes up a large percentage of the smartest guys in the room.  They're the ones keeping all your $$$ for completely disappearing due to rushed, shoddy code.   You should be far more concerned about this hacky, rushed, inadequately tested 2x implementation as that has a legitimate chance of reducing your holdings to nothing.

So a bailout.
@_date: 2017-08-18 00:43:33
Can't disagree with that.  Honestly this is probably aimed a little more at the b2x side.  I'm interested to hear if this is something they've considered or talked about.  I'd have posted this on the other subreddit but it wouldn't have gone anywhere.
@_date: 2017-11-23 22:13:23
Come back when you have some actual substance to your argument.  Your entire account has been created to spam this FUD.  Give it a rest.

@_date: 2017-11-26 03:54:43
Does anyone use this exchange?  I've got my BTG there as it tends to pump there first, but for the life of me I can't work out how to set a limit trade for a higher price.  Seems the only option (to sell for Bitcoin) is an "easy trade" which is basically just an instant sell at market.
Don't really want to have to check the price every 5 mins in case it starts to pump :D
@_date: 2017-11-22 02:15:25
I'm actually having this dilemma at the moment (obviously a major first world problem).  Will be buying a Tesla in the hopefully not too distant future (don't need to hear how bad an idea it is, went through that already, just humour me) and while I have the option of cashing out some coins to pay for it in full, I'd really rather not.   Just curious if there's a consensus on the best approach for this sort of thing.   Take out a loan and pay it off monthly with regular cash (if available) or worst case cash out the monthly payment in coins as needed?
@_date: 2017-11-23 22:11:24
None, it's just more of this Tether/Bitfinex FUD nonsense.
@_date: 2017-11-28 04:12:57
But he clearly doesn't f**k
@_date: 2017-11-27 22:28:45


Thanks!  By all accounts though, AP2 isn't quite up to scratch with 1 just yet (or maybe it is, just) due to the changeover to Tesla Vision, so don't be too jealous.
@_date: 2017-11-22 03:05:06
Yep, definitely seems like the smart approach, and buying a depreciating asset with an appreciating asset (currently anyway) is clearly a bad idea.   There's still that chance that Bitcoin will fail (I don't expect that to happen but it'd be reckless to not at least consider the possibility) so there is something to be said for cashing out the coins I suppose.
Have you used the Tesla finance (or through their "approved financiers on the site anyway) or do you just shop around?
@_date: 2017-11-01 03:04:39
Oh great, now they get to crash the price again with their fake ban news, for the hundredth time.  Stay gone China, fuck you.

Awesome.   So not only do they have:
* No roadmap for the future
* No decent devs
* No ideas
* Nothing unique to their coin
* No merchant adoption
* Unnecessary bigger blocks
They now also lose the one thing they like to bang on about, lower fees.
What an amazing investment for everyone!

@_date: 2017-11-30 21:58:33
Speaking of FUD.  This tether BS has been given way too much attention. Bitfinexed has been FUDing it for ages and it's finally paying off.
Don't feed it.  There's no evidence either way right now, and no reason to assume he's anything but a disgruntled former customer who lost money and has a chip on his shoulder.
If I'm wrong, so be it, but I'll need to see some actual evidence before giving it any credibility.
@_date: 2017-11-28 06:35:39


No I think (hope) you're absolutely correct.   But at the same time, life is short and it's nice to treat yourself every so often.

@_date: 2017-11-27 19:56:17
Yes I know, undervalued asset, depreciating asset etc etc.  Get it out of your system then just be happy for me ;)  Dream car right here, never thought I'd be in a position to afford one.
Bitcoin is enabling this sort of thing for regular folk, it's pretty incredible.
@_date: 2017-11-27 23:27:56
I did the same, that'd be really great but doesn't look likely unfortunately :(
@_date: 2017-11-27 23:30:16


Yep that's not a bad option, risk aside (but there's already risk of the price dropping anyway I suppose).
@_date: 2017-11-27 21:56:39


I was always sold on the blue, but I visited a showroom yesterday and as I was driving out I saw a dark grey S with the grey rims.  That looked REALLY good and almost swayed me.
@_date: 2017-11-18 01:09:16
I'll have to look into that.  I'm not in the US so not sure if that's a factor.

I did, but not too sure about the end of year thing, I'll have to look into that.  They did end the $1000 referral bonus in October so maybe its to do with that?
@_date: 2017-11-21 20:03:50


That remains to be seen does it not?
Don't get me wrong, I don't really care about Tether either way, but I know Bitfinexed has had his panties in a twist for a good long while, and nothing he's said, or the manner he's said it, has encouraged me to believe him to be honest.   
It'll all come out in the wash, either way, and it'll be interesting to follow regardless.

@_date: 2017-11-28 03:33:38


Yeah look, I think you're doing the right thing to be honest.    If we're all lucky, this crazy ride will continue well into the future and making these decisions won't even be a factor.   You'll just be able to get one of each ;)

Yep me too, it's more about the tech than the car (which is also why I got into Bitcoin for the most part, the code is pretty beautiful), but it's a sexy car as well ;)


Yeah that's definitely a possibility, and a bit of a worry.  I should probably cash out the required amount now, technically, but I just feel weird selling them. It's going to be bittersweet when I finally do it (though I'll never sell all of them).


Thanks, it's all pretty surreal.

I've been in Bitcoin since its inception.  It certainly wasn't about its value then, and it's not now (though it doesn't hurt).


Yeah, I hear that a lot but for some reason it's always either from old school dinosaur bankers, or people like yourself who missed the boat and hope to pump their worthless alts.   Too late mate.

I was all amped up to get the 100D, but the sales guy actually talked me down to the 75 which was pretty good of him (maybe they're just trying to clear stock of the batteries :D).   Realistically the 75 range is more than enough, I don't do long drives at all really, and it's considerably cheaper.

Both software, yep.   The tax thing is probably only applicable here as we have the "luxury car tax", which is an awesome way of the government fleecing more money for nothing (tiny thumbs up).
Adding those software update upgrades (Autopilot etc) afterwards just means you pay less LCT initially.  Doesn't work out to much, but I'd rather keep the money than give it to the govt.

I went with the grey rims (incredibly overpriced, but less messing about), Premium Upgrade (because why not), Autopilot (I'm actually adding this on afterwards to save a bit of tax, and it's just a software update) and the cream interior :)

@_date: 2018-02-02 04:07:38


It's exactly the same, what makes you think it's any different?
Long term hodlers have been through this many times over years, this is nothing special.   It's only the weak hands who jumped on board in the latest hype cycle that are panicking now.
Yawn.   Things have never looked better for Bitcoins fundamentals (Samsung on board, Square, Lightning taking off etc).  Once all these noobs sell out and the strong hands remain, things can get back on track (and it's not all about the price, development will continue regardless of the price).
@_date: 2017-09-14 01:58:25

Once again, a lot of this boils down to the 2x proponents not understanding the technology they're trying to change.  They're just following along with what they've been told by the people with an agenda, and they don't understand enough about how the tech works to formulate their own opinion.

Sorry, I meant pre split coins as in, already split.  So after the hard fork, this service will do the work to split a bunch of coins, then they'll distribute satoshis of the split coins in a faucet for others to use.

See this is what's causing all this drama, people without technical knowledge getting all uppity about things they don't understand.
This "convoluted, slow" development (there's nothing contentious about it) is how things like this are done in the real world.  It's called planning and testing, and is exactly why 2x is being rejected (it's rushed and untested).
@_date: 2018-02-02 22:37:28

Recently got an Apple Watch, and obviously I have Crypto Pro showing the large complication, along with the update time.  I find quite often it just stops updating though, have you had any problems with it?   If you don't have the large complication on the Modular watch face you might not notice, as I think that's the only one that shows the actual update time (set to every 20 mins).

The really sad (and embarrassing) thing here is that the pawns (because that's what they are at this stage, they're being manipulated) arguing against Segwit don't even understand it one bit!   They're being told nonsense and just choose to believe it rather than taking the hour to actually read up/watch a video on how Segwit REALLY works and it's perks.  I'd bet most of them, if they took that time, would realise it's actually exactly what they want.

As a hobbyist developer myself (who gets paid for it but is really just a glorified tinkerer), I have huge respect for the core devs, they do some really groundbreaking unique work and it's quite brilliant.
Say what you will about Bitcoin vs other coins, but there's no arguing that we easily have the best group of developers working on this protocol, and it's one of the main reasons (fundamentals aside) why I think Bitcoin has made it this far and will continue to thrive. The innovation from these guys is on another level, but it's also just incredibly stable and bug free. 
Kudos to the devs, I know it's often thankless work but there's at least one nerd here who quite often marvels at the quality of your work ����

"nobody has the faintest idea who Satoshi is"
They didn't even bother entertaining Craig Wright's obvious bullshit (fuck that guy). I mean we all know he's full of shit, but the mass media don't always do (any) research into these things and just fall for the nonsense.
@_date: 2017-06-14 21:16:49


And still way, WAY too rushed and undertested for the scale of changes being proposed.
Regardless, we all know it's not going to happen as it's a preposterous proposition and, in my opinion, lacks the technical expertise of enough competent developers to achieve it.
Plus, the more Jihan etc talk, the more people realise their actual intentions (see the daft hard fork announcement yesterday).  There's no way they're going to get this across the line.
