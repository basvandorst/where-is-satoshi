Thanks for the info...the more the merrier! Sounds like Tor will be available for OpenBazaar in the 2.0 release hopefully within a few months :)

Exactly my thoughts as well.  I would much rather have a slow growth period for bitcoin for awhile to build an unstoppable foundation of uses and security before the large institutions jump in and have any influence on what happens here.

Great point- more people earning btc through services provided would be a great improvement to the ecosystem as well and hopefully see more of that soon too.  I would think all this activity outside of traditional banking would increase the fungibility of bitcoin in some way but Im not smart enough to know for sure. :/

The funny thing is that up until a few days ago Chris "the oracle of knowing what will not happen" Derose didn't even know OpenBazaar had a built in dispute resolution system which is one of the most important parts of OB. His OB rants will be very fun to replay in a few years

Very true...used to want everyone and their Grandma to start using bitcoin a couple years ago and now I'm more focused on getting the current bitcoiners involved in building the network and using the services that are already available like Openbazaar and that will be the focus of my blog.  A bitcoin ETF makes me feel a little uneasy at this point for this very reason but who knows what will happen.

Freedom kills bitcoin. Ending the drug war, legalizing gambling and prostitution, having debt free sound money that is backed by gold or some other scarce resource, getting rid of KYC/AML laws, capital controls and eliminate taxes and transaction fees and bitcoin will become worthless. Here's to tyranny :/

They have a working version right now and are planning on releasing it as part of the 2.0 version hopefully in a few months...

Thanks! The weekly OB vendor AMA is good idea.  If anyone would like me to do a vendor profile on them let me know or feel free to take the format and make your own :)
