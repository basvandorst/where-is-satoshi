If you are concerned about that then you should be going vegan. Watch the documentary "cowspiracy" on netflix.

You should work on becoming a vegan then. Watch the documentary "cowspiracy" on netflix. Do you have any idea how much land is needed to raise animals? Do you have any idea how many trees are cut down to make more land? Do you have any idea how much water is needed? The bitcoin energy is nothing compared to the animal agriculture industry

I can't remember but it's either 4GB or 8GB. I'll have to check when I'm home.

This is a brand new computer. The only thing installed is League of Legends, Chrome, VLC media player, Ledger Live, and iTunes. I have more than enough disk space.

It does not run at start up

Every single person should watch cowspiracy and forks over knives

Bitcoin.qt will open and proceed to sync. 5 minutes later my computer starts to slow down and lag. Chrome becomes unresponsive. Then the bitcoin core wallet is unresponsive. Then my mouse cursor is unresponsive. After this happens, I am unable to open task manager. The only option I have is to manually turn off my PSU by the switch. Then I turn on my computer again. It starts back up slowly. It’s so strange. It’s as if it’s hungover. Windows loads slowly but after 5 min everything runs smoothly.

Don't worry about how long it took you to change. In America the schools do not teach us about nutrition or how to invest our money or read a balance sheet. Our government has let us down. At least you are now aware of what is going on.
@_date: 2018-02-17 00:59:52
Oh you mean the facts like "slightly higher" levels? So vague. "Slightly warmer" again vague. nothing factual was said lmao
@_date: 2018-02-20 23:12:25
Watch cowspiracy. Humanities meat diet is killing the environment. Go vegan.

Can someone post a link or explain how to use TOR? Please explain as if you were speaking to a young child.

So his "slightly higher co2 levels" and "slightly warmer planet" qualifies as being good points?
These aren't slightly higher levels. We are at astronomically high levels

Watch Cowspiracy on Netflix and learn what is actually destroying the planet. Everyone is eating too much meat. Forests are being cut down to raise cows and chickens. Go plant based to save the Earth.

So if I deposit 1 bitcoin onto the site, I can exchange it for BT1 + BT2 tokens, sell my BT2 tokens for BT1, exchange all my BT1 into bitcoin, then withdraw into a wallet? Am I understanding this correctly?

How can I safely go about splitting my coins?

What about all the poop from the animals? These companies dump it into our rivers and lakes. What about the rate we are fishing at? It is expected by 2050 there will be barely any fish left. What about all the rainforests that are being cut down? The Earth can't repair itself if there are no more forests!
@_date: 2018-02-16 21:21:17
Although legislation helping our planet will be great, we cannot wait for that. Each person can make a huge difference by not rewarding the meat industry with money. Instead reward companies who provide alternatives with your hard earned money.

Why would you buy scamcoins?
@_date: 2018-07-30 19:09:17
People are watching altcoins die in front of their eyes yet refuse to sell it and refuse to fully educate themselves as to why bitcoin is what is innovative and will be adopted lol. Delusional idiots.

Peter keeps claiming with today’s technology, you can buy a cup of coffee with gold using a third party. He claims you can send someone gold using an app and some third party vault will keep tabs on it but he is completely missing the point that all these transactions will be monitored, tracked, and vulnerable to seizure. Your account can be banned. That’s literally the same as the system we have today with online banking. Governments will enforce KYC into this.
@_date: 2019-05-29 18:14:59
This guy speaks as if Bitcoin has no current use cases and that these big corporations like Fidelity and Facebook will give Bitcoin a use case. WRONG! Bitcoin is already useful. I am escaping inflation everyday by holding Bitcoin.
