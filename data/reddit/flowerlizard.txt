That was one expensive pack of gum once you include fees. It's possible to buy a pack of gum with Bitcoin but it would get pretty expensive to do that more than once. I support and believe in Bitcoin but I hope fees will come down soon so that making simple purchases like this becomes more feasible.

We're talking about technologies that concentrate the emission of waves in a way that the sun does not. Would you like to run your microwave with no door? An x-ray machine with no shield? Just because you don't feel the effects of radio frequencies doesn't mean other people don't. All of this technology is new and there are already studies showing that these technologies have a distinct effect on brain waves and other systems in the body. Whether these effects are harmful in the long run has yet to be seen but the effects are there and it stands to reason that some people can feel those effects more than others like yourself.

Different waves have different effects. Humanity evolved while experiencing the waves from the sun, not the waves from 5g satellites or wifi routers. There is no question that radio frequencies effect the body and the brain, so why wouldn't it be possible that some people are more sensitive than others? All of this technology is still very new and it's long term effects are still not entirely known, but many people feel negative effects from increased exposure including myself.

This is a nightmare for anyone with sensitivity to radio frequencies.
