yes, I tried to "catch the falling knife", and it went through my hand. I did have plans to buy back in if it ended up going to say, 1k, but at this point, I like to get a deal. Now that theres been another run up in price since I sold, its a hard psychological barrier for me to overcome to jump back.

When did you buy?

I bought the dip in january at 11.8k, baghodled, got tired of losses and sold everything at 6.8k. AMA

yeah its pretty depressing, actually. I did not buy more at the low, I bought half a coin during that initial big dip in january, figured it was a good entry point, but it just kept going lower and lower. I looked at the graphs and it painted a picture of: big dip, little recovery, big dip/new low, little recovery and so on and so on. There was so much bad news going around and I was worried I would lose my entire investment so I sold it all that day and considered it a lesson. As of today, I still wouldn't be "in the money" but the trajectory looks good and theres support at 8k for the last week or so. FML

yeah for me it was purely investment and I treated it that way. I don't think it will ever (no time soon) be used as a currency. Why would you ever use an asset with such big swings to say, buy a loaf of bread? That loaf of bread that cost you $3 today could have earned you $100 a week later. I wouldn't go around paying for stuff with my AAPL or NVDA stock either for that matter, even if I could. 
Note: don't listen to me, I have a terrible crystal ball when it comes to crypto, apparently.
Edit: yes, I know it IS being used as currency already in a limited way. I'm talking about using it to buy a can of soda from a vending machine type of adoption.
