SPLC is a leftist socialist hate group in themselves. If you don’t agree them or have a different point of view, they label you as a hate group. This is bank control based on beliefs or political views. Sounds like China.
Very sad this is the way our world is going

I don’t see how you would want to do this. Since you can’t do anything with the crypto currency, you don’t really own it. Smell what I’m stepping in?
