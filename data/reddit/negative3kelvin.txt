Giving in BTC means giving the whole value of that, including whatever appreciation occurred.  Liquidating into a fiat currency may come with a capital gains tax hit, and then a large portion of the value is lost to something other than the intended donation recipient.

Those factors mean you'll still get different keypairs with the same source files.

**THIS** is one of many excellent replies to "Bitcoin has *no intrinsic value*"
@_date: 2013-12-09 22:54:14
It's meant more as a safe that one leaves at home, hence the default of not having a public key embedded either.  We are experimenting with a much lighter, somewhat smaller set-up for carrying a metal public key tag.  Something that would work well in a physical wallet or on a keychain, etc...  Any demand or interest in such?
@_date: 2013-12-09 22:46:41
Thanks for the heads-up; we appreciate the link!

I love the logo and your idea and want one of the shirts... but I'm late to the Indiegogo party on that... Is there any chance of a "more shirts" reward, kinda like the second Dark Wallet Pack?

We have a Stainless Steel model in the works, which will withstand a lot more, and has a melt point way above the temperatures normally observed in house fire scenarios.

Further, consider the entity represented on the other end of the phone *is not human* and doesn't play by "rational person" rules... doesn't even operate on the same plane of existence.
@_date: 2013-12-10 05:51:47
Both correct; this is why we do not ask the customer to send us the plain format private key, and instead use BIP38 pass phrase encryption.
@_date: 2013-12-10 00:38:55
TheSelfGoverned nails it.  We'd like to add that if you add the private key to a local machine wallet, re-use makes perfect sense.  If you add the private key to an online wallet, you should then evaluate your trust of that company and its security before re-use of the firesafe.

Carrying a large amount of cash is rarely a good idea, and check fraud keeps getting more common.  Paypal and the like all want to take a cut... Bitcoin seems to solve these problems pretty well.  Downsides would be if interested buyers or the sellers don't use Bitcoin... waiting for confirmations... other?
@_date: 2013-12-01 00:21:13
Or replace step 6 and buy a Bitcoin Firesafe and have them put that encrypted key embedded in metal, so it's even safer than a paper wallet.  
@_date: 2013-05-08 22:14:01
Thanks for that; pretty useful calculator.  The thing I'm looking for / remembering though was a list of people/emails and geographic locations of those willing to trade bitcoin for local currencies.
@_date: 2013-12-09 22:51:50
Ahhh; we'll have to make that more clear.  Thanks for the feedback!
@_date: 2013-12-10 05:49:54
Oh snap; thanks!

Do you have a BitMessage address?
@_date: 2013-12-11 22:12:42
Possibly  ?

Here's mine for Coinbase, but aimed at Google Drive... might work in Excel:  `=substitute(regexextract(importdata(" ":(.*),"); char(34); "")`

Private car sales are usually live transactions, where the buyer does a test drive... most of the risk seems to be on the seller accepting a possibly-forged check or some such... that's my thought anyway.  Is there much buyer protection on any used car sale using other transaction methods?

Our thoughts regarding a metallic keychain offering is that it would display a public Bitcoin address only.  You would not want a private key to be visible to anyone... you'd want to keep it somewhere safe and secure.  We do use BIP38 to encrypt our clients' private keys, so even we don't know the actual private key, but carrying your private key on you at all times makes less sense to us than keeping it somewhere safe.  We'd love to hear alternative reasoning though; we aren't done developing our product line.
@_date: 2013-12-11 22:08:45
Like  does?  :-)
@_date: 2013-12-11 20:55:21
Gorgeous work!  We're doing BIP38 encrypted, slightly smaller ones at  as a cold-storage, private key sorta thing and ran a black friday sale...  We're talking about public address options as vanity pieces, but have only done one as a custom order so far.
@_date: 2013-11-24 18:44:48
Put that coin in a Bitcoin Firesafe...    It's like a paper wallet, but made of metal, and you can put a password on it too... which you're probably never going to mess up again.  :-)
@_date: 2013-12-10 05:55:59
All true; we're still brainstorming on other killer use-cases, but so far, the firesafe scenario is the one that's made the most sense to us.
@_date: 2013-12-09 22:50:35
That's an option we're looking at right now, in terms of pricing.  If you include commentary regarding that on the order, we can discuss and come up with something.  It *is* available.
