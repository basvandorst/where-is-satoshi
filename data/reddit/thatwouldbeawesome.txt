Thank you for the reply! I hear what you are saying and it makes a lot of sense. I'm not sure if that supports the legal concept of ownership. We can also think of situations where the opposite scenario may occur. Suppose I have my bitcoin in a third party custodian. I may have legal ownership of the coin, but I won't have transaction signing authority to prove control.

Great guy. Informative videos too. Love what he's doing.

Exactly! I thought of the same example too but substituted a gold coin for the dollar bill. Exact same distinction. Tricky, tricky.

I am bumping my head against this problem too. I have thought that signing with a private key should work, but that only proves that I control the public key. This does not prove that I own the value associated with the public key.
 I can think of situations where I could get a friend to sign a transaction of his own keys and purport to a third party that I own them. Proof of control is not the same as proof of ownership.
Very curious as to the community's thoughts on this issue.

At what bitcoin price does it make sense for him to buy the dump?

Serious question: What's the value proposition of Liquid now that BitGo launched BitGo Instant with the major exchanges? 
Seems like it does the exact same thing and it's already launched.

Bitcoins seem to have a very interesting doubling tendency.  From a base of $.50, they've overshot and consolidated around $1, $2, $4, $8, and now $16.  This is easier to see on a [logscale]( 
Bought in around $6.  I've sold everything for now while the market absorbs this last boost higher.  Hopefully we consolidate around the $13-$14 range where I'll start buying dips.

Agreed.  How do we know that exchange reported volume is accurate in any way?

Absolutely correct.  Hopefully authorized participants (APs) sign up to create/redeem the trust and then provide sub-creation unit liquidity in the market place.  Will take time, though.
