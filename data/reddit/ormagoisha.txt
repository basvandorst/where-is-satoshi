also i realize the VPN would solve outgoing connections, but wouldn't i have to mask all my internet traffic as a whole to prevent incoming connections being a problem? ie my entire local network would have to be running through a VPN.

Well, I'm not so sure thats accurate. Usually when you become financially independent you set up a bank account, and most bank accounts have monthly fees associated, esp if you dont have a minimum set of funds in said account. It's from there that you move on to having a credit card, which also come with their own transaction fees that are passed down to the retailer.
With lightning I found it pretty simple. Download wallet, send funds to wallet, autoconnect to lightning and wait for a couple blocks of confirmation. You might say this is too long for the initial set up, but banks and credit card companies are much, much slower to set things up, and you usually are there in person or on the phone with someone dealing with terms and conditions that are buried in fine print.
once the autoconnect process is complete, you don't really need to close the channel at any point. the fees are at the satoshi level, and the payments are instantaneous. literally hit pay, and a payment being received indicator will light up within half a second (you can try this on 
while it might seem stupid to pay to open and close channels, its a payment that allows for incredible usabilty. seems like a decent tradeoff to me. especially since you're unlikely to need to open and close these channels very often, if ever.
@_date: 2018-01-10 15:09:10
With eclair you autoconnect to lightning and just keep the channel open. The idea is to use that channel to pay anyone on the lightning network, not just the ln node you're connected to.
@_date: 2018-01-19 20:16:32
does that not still leave someone vulnerable to a bad actor at the VPN provider?
@_date: 2018-01-06 10:07:41
It's equivalent to opening a chequing account. After that you don't really need to open or close channels. The ui would hide the complicated ideas and just turn all lightning transactions into regular transactions. I don't see any reason for the average person to see anything about channels, locked coins etc.
@_date: 2018-01-19 20:15:39
wouldn't that make it only accessible to people on Tor?
@_date: 2018-01-08 09:40:00
I don't believe that's true. Lightning works without segwit, just not quite as decentralized AFAIK. Segwit includes a txn malleability fix that's needed to do more trustless stuff with smart contracts, I think anyway.

Epstein hasn't been convicted yet and is likely to get yet another deal for providing information unfortunately. 
Nothing proves Trump is guilty so far. Clinton isn't a nothing burger, he's the former president, and his wife tried twice to become president and acid washed emails and had cell phones destroyed before FBI agents could access them. There's something deeply fishy going on here, and who knows, maybe it involves Trump too, but so far theres a lot less evidence suggesting that he's balls deep in this the way the clintons are.
@_date: 2019-07-17 08:32:04
You're going to have to show me proof of that before we can accuse someone. Epstein has already been arrested twice, and has multiple accusers, and an island famously known as pedophile island... Trump doesn't have those things attached to him yet. Maybe there will be direct evidence attached to trump yet, but some how I doubt it. Under him there has been a record number of arrests of pedophiles.
@_date: 2019-07-11 18:34:47
There are alternatives but none of them will beat google. I can live with that for the most part though. Protonmail or tutanota for mail (the latter also just released a calendar app, and proton will be releasing a drive competitor soon). There are alternatives for android that are forks but privacy focused, but I'm unaware of anything thats easy to use right now. 
As far as chromecast goes, can't you use a roku instead?
@_date: 2019-07-17 06:34:58
Yeah... Jeffrey Epstein was recently arrested for his pedophile island. Clinton has flown on his "lolita express" private jet 26 times according to flight logs. Bill is known for being a little rapey, considering all the accusations (and everyone is always saying, believe all women!) 
Epstein was balls deep in sex trafficking, I don't think its actually that crazy to imagine Bill Clinton being at least tangentially involved at this point.

Any possible solutions to this problem?
@_date: 2017-12-03 05:54:51
fine for a moderately experienced user but its not really great from a user experience perspective, esp for anyone new or bad with technology. if you can set up a channel there can you use the same coins in another channel? i think that starts to get pretty complicated right. if you have to continually close channels between your cold and hot wallets just to access the coins, it seems like that would defeat the purpose.
@_date: 2017-12-24 19:06:53
is it true that LN needs unencrypted keys to work? Seems like a bad compromise.

its possible but institutions tend to do over the counter purchases rather than trade on an exchange like the rest of us do. at least if its a massive buy.
@_date: 2019-07-17 07:36:37
In fairness to Trump, he went on only a few times (as did many celebs) and pretty quickly had a falling out with Epstein and banned him from his properties. It doesn't mean anything but its a hell of a lot better than Clinton's record right now.

here's my question. would CME still be purchasing bitcoin themselves of is this purely speculation on price from their index. i realize these are all cash settlements. I assume they won't purchase any btc since that would be more like an ETF.
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:41:52
no worries, i got a 2nd testnet txn to confirm... and then both confirmed. so i managed to test it just fine. works great once it confirms!
@_date: 2017-12-29 05:45:30
lol, likeliness isn't exactly the way you design secure systems.
if someone finds out that a person or a family has 100 million dollars worth of bitcoin, whats to stop them from going to that extent? the only thing at this point are the fear of getting caught and any morals they may have. 
if it can happen, it will. there are a lot of people out there, and a lot of show off bitcoin billionaires now. hell if you run an exchange this could happen to you. basically if you have bitcoin, shut the fuck up about it, or hire some serious security/carry weapons at all times.
unlike fiat, these thefts are irreversible so the incentives are high.
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:27:42
turns out it wasnt even the channel it was the initial testnet faucet that didnt even confirm. tried again...
[edit] eventually confirmed. lightning is super fast once you get that first channel open!

That deal was given to epstein before trump hired him, and the quote alone doesn't mean a whole lot. younger side could be 20-21 territory, not 14-16. 
There isn't a whole lot of point speculating really until we have the full story... but really, Vox of all places? That site is leftist propaganda of the highest order.

i wish my LN channel would confirm. its been like 30 minutes and it just refuses to confirm the testnet channel.
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:11:38
1. so if you go offline, it's not necessary that the channel will close either then. because it seems undesirable to do so, but inevitable that sometimes a user would be offline for various reasons. could this be written into the payment channel conditions? like say the channel has the option to close if a user is offline for more than a week.
2. sounds like hw wallet support is kind of a long way off. is anyone actively looking into this issue? like say satoshi labs?
3. if I understand correctly, this means you don't need to close a channel to spend the coins in another transaction or channel?
Thanks for taking the time to answer my questions! really appreciate it :)

Mistranslation or misunderstanding. Banks will use blockchain tech. Tons of banks use it already or are interested. Think ripple or other blockchain projects out there that can be adopted as private chains. Bitcoin technology, but not bitcoin itself.

you can multisig it all you want, that aint stopping someone from torturing you til you and several other parties give up the keys.
@_date: 2017-12-29 05:21:21
Let me put it this way.
"we'll kill him unless you agree to all sign the keys, the hostage has already agreed after we severed his fingers and genitals. Meet us at x location tomorrow with all signing parties present or you'll receive his severed head the following day".
If someone wants keys badly enough and is psycho enough, they can pull that and more often than not people will give in or they risk losing loved ones or colleagues.

Not exactly related but I'm wondering what happens in the following circumstances for LN:
- if 1 party goes offline for a period of time (like say internet connection lost for a few hours or offline because you're on vacation and can't afford the data).
- is there any work being done to make LN compatible with hardware wallets. it kind of sucks if you only want to take out a little amount and need to spend money to move to a LN capable wallet, then spend money to open a channel, and spend money to close that channel.
- ive read that you can potentially keep channels open in perpetuity if the contract is designed as such. but lets say i'm buying coffee at starbucks over the course of the year. at the end of the year starbucks may want to use the money i paid them. do they have to close the channel to use that money? if so doesn't that make channels that are open in perpetuity kind of unlikely?
@_date: 2017-12-25 07:33:34
What precautions can you take?
@_date: 2017-12-25 08:52:27
Yeah I understand, but I think it's a big ask. In fact it's probably unrealistic to expect most enthusiasts to go through the required reading and constant surveillance of their own node. And that's an enthusiast too. It'll be a very tiny proportion of people willing to risk coin and time with all that stress added on top.
@_date: 2017-12-25 07:57:50
Thanks for writing a detailed post on this. Have to say it's disappointing how much effort this is as it's going to be way too much to deal with for 99% of people. I hope we get a nice package that can be setup in a few clicks one day.
@_date: 2017-12-02 19:06:19
They're not holding any bitcoin and its cash settlement. It's purely a speculation on price via index.
@_date: 2017-12-29 10:10:24
sure and they can kill you to make an example out of you. 
my main point here is that if it can happen, it will. just because you can take measures against theft doesn't mean malicious people still wont try and still won't go to extremes. perhaps making an example out of a few people will deter people from extra precautions, perhaps a lack of success will deter future attempts, but someone always thinks they've got it figured out. 
unspent/safe bitcoins aren't worth much when you've lost a few fingers or wind up dead because you can't give up the goods.
basically, everyone should never talk about the bitcoin they own and live a modest lifestyle. any suspicion that you might have some coin is enough to make you a target. hell, telling friends or family is a huge risk because if they tell someone, that someone might tell someone who overhears that information. if a few million dollars of relatively  anonymous funds that isnt defended by a bank can be stolen by scaring the shit out of some normie, you bet it'll happen.
@_date: 2017-12-03 06:50:28
i'm no expert but this is my thinking.
- transfer coins from hot wallet to cold wallet. 
- coins are "in" payment channel.
- use said coins in another payment channel betwee yourself and say, starbucks.
the problem i'm seeing is whether or not the coins from one payment channel can easily move across to another unrelated payment channel when the previous channel is still open. lightning network is really just a tally of what transactions you would like to happen til the channel is closed right? basically transactions not actually happening until its broadcast to the blockchain.
either way it does seem kind of complicated and unfortunate that you have to spend money to open a payment channel to yourself.
@_date: 2017-12-24 17:38:24

yeah, im completely with you there. imo this would be the worst time to start regulating the shit out of the internet. not only are we on the cusp of some very massive changes technologically (not just blockchain, but vr/ar, AI/deep learning, IoT etc), but we're on the cusp of some newer internet technologies that offer great broadband speeds over the air. various wireless tech + low earth orbit satellites would offer a new wave of tech and competition with existing providers tech that it would be a giant mistake to start heavily regulating. i think its really short sighted. we get frustrated with the near term and fail to see the forest for the trees. but reddit hivemind must downvote because reddit has told them otherwise.
@_date: 2017-12-15 03:52:45
yeah its kind of amazing how people bought that whole thing in the first place. it's a clear attempt for the government to sink its teeth into yet another industry and regulate it (its not as thought it wasnt already regulated to shit). its extra surprising that bitcoin users are all about government regulation when it comes to the internet, but are largely anti-government regulation when it comes to bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-02 17:11:09
Doesn't lightning require a constantly connected wallet? If so what happens if you go offline or use a hardware wallet?

i kind of hope safe decides to just opt out of creating an entirely new crypto and makes a sidechain on btc or something but thats me. i like the ideas they have but it seems silly to give up all the security bitcoin has to offer and start from scratch entirely. seems more beneficial to simply build ontop with their new ideas as a sidechain.
@_date: 2017-08-20 17:31:34
how is it a good compromise if it hasnt been properly peer reviewed? furthermore why would you be comfortable with developers that arent willing to test their code thoroughly before inflicting their shoddy code upon a currency thats worth 68 billion.
@_date: 2018-10-03 07:01:01
Thanks for the run down.
I know the MaidSafe team are working on a cryptocurrency for SAFE as well. Is it meant to compete with the likes of bitcoin as a standalone currency or is it mainly meant as a SAFE network token that can be represented by a currency like bitcoin. If it is its own currency, I noticed it is supposedly blockchain-less. How does that security model compare with bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-10-03 19:03:38
Sounds a little like bram cohen's Chia Cryptocurrency. Any word on when SAFECoin will be released? or is it still very early?
Furthermore what's to suggest that the maidsafe team have made the right call on their security model for their cryptocurrency. bitcoin at least is tried and tested, and arguably its energy use is a feature, not a bug.
@_date: 2018-10-02 15:59:31
I saw a tweet that seemed to indicate some support for the safe network, but they're getting their own cryptocurrency developed. How much does solid relate to safe if at all?
@_date: 2017-08-20 17:46:42
im not a developer, but it takes time for people to do a proper audit of code. the fact that this has been thrust upon the community as quickly as it has makes me pretty suspicious of their intentions. this isn't normal software. if theres a bug or an exploit its a really serious issue, thus thorough testing is mandatory. that takes a lot of time.
@_date: 2018-10-04 01:45:29
its a bit of a shame they couldn't just use bitcoin. yet another cryptocurrency, as exciting as it sounds, just fragments the market even more. im personally more excited by the safenetwork than the crypto but i suppose the crypto is necessary to power the network and reward people. still, wish it was with bitcoin, esp since lightning 
already had its soft launch so to speak.

I don't know why people keep assuming this. It's just as likely that this government shit coin will be highly traceable and will not be easily exchanged for btc since they'll likely ban btc exchanges out right or restrict how much you can invest.
China is about control. Look at what they're doing with hong kong. Nothing the Chinese government does will ever be "good for bitcoin" unless they manage to collapse their whole system and cause real capital flight via btc to occur.
@_date: 2019-10-23 22:45:28
Halving never causes a price boost immediately. It takes like a year before you really start to see the supply shock take effect. Halving usually causes a dump around or shortly after due to a loss of faith in near term price increases.
@_date: 2018-06-30 19:36:54
[edit] since the deleted his comment, here is the original comment I responded to: 
decentralized blockchains only work with monetary incentives. otherwise why would anyone want to participate in the system? people are not altruistic, they are self interested, and thats why bitcoin works. it takes into account our fundamental human nature and applies it to something positive.
anyway, if you can't decentralize a blockchain, theres very little use for a blockchain. its less efficient than simply running a centralized database. the main reason to decentralize is for security and resisting censorship, but again, that requires monetary incentive to guarantee that people freely participate in that network and help maintain its decentralized nature.
@_date: 2019-10-29 14:03:26
I think you're more confident than I am on this. Banning btc in china would be pretty negative because the population as a whole is less likely to even consider it a viable investment. There's a lot of group think, conformist mentality there esp since the government so tightly controls the news and media. 
Plus, they could always do something like say owning bitcoin is punishable by 10 year prison sentences or even death. It doesn't matter that it would be very difficult to ever prove that someone owns bitcoin. Just the fact that the punishment exists would force the majority to self-regulate here and get rid of their btc asap. China and bitcoin are not buddies because China wants absolute control. They're only interested in crypto so far as they can use it as a means of control and surveillance on their own people, that and say to the world they are global leaders in cryptocurrency even if what they release isn't a true cryptocurrency.
I'd certainly love to see china adopt bitcoin as long as they're not going to be corrupting it (which seems exceedingly unlikely). But again, consider how theyre treating hong kong and think "does china want to let freedom flourish". I think the answer is a thunderous "No".

i very much hope you're right that other entities couldn't have bought enough bitcoin to pump the price up to this extent (and to dump later). 
@_date: 2017-11-11 01:57:44
i just mean that for the purpose of an exchange, the bitcoin is tied up in the payment channel. so they dont really have "access" to it until the channel closes. if the channel closes too soon then you kind of defeat the purpose of starting a payment channel in the first place esp since it requires more bitcoin to close the channel (afaik). from what it looks like to me, so long as the bitcoin is actually tied up in a payment channel (which might be in perpetuity), the exchange doesn't actually "have" that bitcoin yet and thus needs to rely on on its own tally system or a set of IOUs to settle payments for fiat/crypto or crypto/crypto trades. i think atomic swaps can solve the crypto/crypto problem, assuming exchanges want to opt for a decentralized solution to a centralized platform.

these futures markets opening up just means big investors have a big reason to try and dump the price. lets say you pump the price of bitcoin, then go to the futures market, short the price and then immediately start dumping bitcoin at that peak bubble. youre going to not only make money on the bitcoin you sold, but make a lot shorting (ie betting that its going down in price).
honestly, the futures market coming into play for bitcoin at this stage makes me scared, not excited. it would be different if this were an ETF, but this is all about betting on price, so hteres every incentive to fuck around with the price. whales can easily open up accounts on all kinds of exchagnes and pump and dump the price on a whim.
@_date: 2017-11-11 18:20:16
I wasn't aware. Thanks for clearing that up.
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:20:34
yeah atomic swaps will happen, not sure those require centralized exchanges though. i have read that there are some real fundamental issues with atomic swaps but i really dont know the details.
as far as lightning goes, the reason why i said theyre not "real" is just because they aren't registered on chain until the channel closes or collapses. in the mean time the exchange doesn't actually get those coins to trade on the exchange, they have to facilitate trading via tokens/ious that represent the coins that haven't been officially transacted on the blockchain yet. this kind of scenario to me seems like a situation where an exchange could either lose money or start operating a bit more like a fractional reserve bank and just "creating" tokens out of thin air. there isn't something like a proof of solvency that can be done here i dont think since you'd have to collapse all the channels and sum up the totals before doing so.
also even if exchanges used to accept only 1 conf, that doesn't make it a good idea or something likely to happen going forward. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 02:27:13
doesn't the bitcoin still have to actually be spent though? also i've heard this "internet circa 1994" talk for years now. when does it become internet circa 1995 :P
@_date: 2017-11-10 17:12:30
i'm having trouble understanding how or why an exchange would integrate lightning. with an exchange you're actually trading coins of one blockchain to another, or to fiat. lightning transactions arent really "real" until the channel closes. I don't think an exchange is going to want to deal in coins that are not directly under their control for risky trades. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 17:33:15
considering most exchanges force users to wait x number of confirmations before they can even trade coins it seems like the kind of risk they would never want to take. market pressure or not, if its not a feasible step to take, it won't happen. maybe i'm not understanding it correctly though.
as I understand it, lightning is better used for smaller transactions and micropayments, not big payments -- so i'm not sure the exchange use case is really there since most people are probably trading a few thousand dollars in cryptocurrency. not exactly "small".
@_date: 2017-11-10 17:09:02
what do you think of this?
@_date: 2017-11-11 02:00:40
what does being a network have anything to do with this topic? 
the problem i'm seeing here is that when you use payment channels, sure the transaction appears instantly, but the actual bitcoin is "occupied" in the payment channel and remains there until the channel closes. of course you can close at any time but starting and stopping payment channels require some bitcoin to be spent, which disincentivizes closing channels too soon (for a good reason).
anyway the problem is that if you have that bitcoin in a payment channel, then the exchange doesn't actually have access to that bitcoin for trades directly. it seems like the kind of thing that might become a problem when fiat comes into play because there are no atomic swap type solutions to be had that work there... unless you create some sort of token again perhaps?
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:44:29
Interesting. I really like the idea of the lighting network but I have to say the whole spending funds to secure a channel feels clunky as hell.

Even if you want a heater, get an asic. You'll at least make some cash while doing it, even if its just a tiny amount. 
I'm not 100% sure, but I had a good chunk of watercooled GPUs at one point and eventually they all became worthless hunks of garbage. Even the ones that worked and were sold off, ended up getting returned for failing shortly after. You'd think heat wouldn't be the problem since they were all watercooled without any leaking occurring (and thats a massive.... massive pain in the ass). 
GPUs became worthless for mining a long time ago. I moved to scrypt coins, but then that became worthless very quickly. about a year... and that was like 2013 or something? We're so far beyond that now. You'd basically just be hitting your head against the wall with a gpu now unfortunately. The good part of this is that if you do buy an asic miner... at least you still have a usable computer. Plus its probably much easier to set up now than it was back in the day. Used to be a huge hassle just to get anything working on the software end. Plus constant crashes and random errors. It was a babysitting job, not something you could just set and forget. Plus, because it was running GPUs to the max capacity, you were more prone to fires if you didn't have excellent cooling solutions (and even then maybe something shorts out).
IMO, not worth it at all. It's actually a net negative any way you look at it outside of getting a modern, current gen asic. And I should stress, even with an ASIC you're unlikely to make a profit if your power bill isn't super low, especially when the price of bitcoin is depressed. The only times you're soaring are when the price is sky rocketing and you've got cutting edge mining equipment that the competition doesn't have yet. Again, difficult.

Is this another one of those things where miners might decide to try and block it?
@_date: 2019-04-11 03:39:11
well im specifically interested in all the onchain gains i guess. i know LN promises big things but no one will want to use LN if fees to start a channel and close a channel are really high (and thats regardless of actually wanting to close a channel). anyway it all sounds promising but id still be curious to see what those on chain benefits are.
@_date: 2019-04-11 03:06:42
with all of those technologies we're getting 53.76 tps? I mean, its nice but it doesn't seem like a vast improvement does it?
@_date: 2019-04-09 00:11:40
any potential solutions outside of increasing the blocksize?
@_date: 2019-04-11 21:22:51
OK, thanks for taking the time to explain. Sounds very promising!
What kind of timeline are we looking at for something like eltoo or splicing?
@_date: 2019-04-11 04:53:06
Hmm, so that also solves closing channels too?
@_date: 2019-04-11 03:43:59
im concerned with on chain because i want off chain to succeed. at least as far as i understand, when you create a LN channel, you must pay a fee, and then you must have coins reserved for a potential channel closing for any reason. as the fees fluctuate, your channel's funds can potentially get set aside for the reserve to make sure a channel can actually close. this could in the future potentially result in channels costing a lot to open, but a lot to maintain as well since you may have to top up channels repeatedly just to keep up with slowly rising txn fees. 
so yeah, i think on chain is still important, even if offchain becomes the main way of using btc.

its just a fork of chrome. don't see what the issue is since brave have done some good work adding in privacy features.
@_date: 2019-04-11 14:37:43
ok well lets set eltoo aside because that seems like a separate use case. if you have LN channels open without eltoo, then you do need to set aside coins to close the channel, even if you never intend to close the channel, and thats where my concern about ever increasing fees comes in (as in, constantly having to top up to make sure the channel has the option to close).
@_date: 2019-12-20 05:00:45
Are you building a new machine for this? If you are, get a proper mining ASIC for btc. the time to use gpus was like 10 years ago. 
Also the bit about wear and tear correct. Usually mining kills GPUs in a year or two of constant usage at near max rates.
@_date: 2017-11-30 01:46:50
that really depends on what this bubble was predicated on. was it really the average person buying up bitcoin that could raise the prices this high? or was it whales buying up and pumping the price, anticipating that the futures markets would open up so that they could dump and make a fortune?
i certainly hope im wrong here, but it scares me. 
@_date: 2019-12-21 16:08:40
From what I remember (it's been a long while). The biggest issues with mining are fans (if you aren't water cooling and most people never do that). Those things have basically X number of revolutions in their lifespan before they'll mechanically kick the bucket. The next big one are capacitors for the VRM. You dont really get any warning that its going to fail either, they just fail. If you aren't cooling effectively, the heat might also get to your components if they get too hot (like running above 90c constantly).
Anyway, I've had components die on me for less. I've had PSUs burst into flames from driving them too hard (not related to mining), as well as shorts causing hard drives to catch on fire. I know someone who also had dedicated gear to mining that caught fire while out of the house. Luckily there were other people there so the smoke damage was minimized. 
Point I'm trying to make here is that if you want to give it a go properly, it's a bit of a babysitting gig. 
If you're only going to use a gpu though, I'm not sure you're actually contributing to the network if you essentially have zero chances of finding a block. Doing work alone doesn't mean much if you statistically have no chance at solving blocks afterall.

I dont think this user knows what bitcoin really is, or how this subreddit operates. Redditor for 7 weeks. It's clearly someone who's just trying to stir shit up.
FYI the mods ain't doing shit. Bitcoin is libertarian. It's about free markets and free minds. The code makes it that way, so you can dislike some "fascist" all you want, but its designed to be used by anyone and everyone, regardless of their moral character. There's no use in bolding all your comments here.

So what? Actions speak louder than words, or genetics. 
Not to mention the fact that people are allowed to want to have their own culture preserved. For instance, the UK is very racially diverse. London itself is a city where white people are now a minority afaik (and thats common in many western cities now). So this isn't a matter of race. It's a matter of cultural values and more importantly, actions. It's one thing to try and co-exist with a very different culture (which I would say is extremely difficult -- just take a look at all the wars that took place in the past). It's another to try and co-exist with people that might be committing a lot of crime after arriving in their new host country.

You never really need to close the channel. The idea is that as lightning gets used more everyone becomes more connected.
So if you've opened a channel with Alice and need too send money to Bob, as long as Alice is some how connected to Bob (it could take many hops) you can use that same channel to send funds to Bob.
@_date: 2019-01-07 00:20:03
couldn't you say the same about bitcoin in general then? i mean if everyone made that decision then bitcoin would become centralized. 
i guess it still seems like nodes in either case have very little use case for a normal person to run. its cool for someone technical who's super into it, but there aren't that many people like that. i'm not sure there's a way to solve that "problem" though. i think its also a bit much to ask someone to understand the trade offs. i get that there are tradeoffs, but will someone out of the loop understand? someone much less technical? people can't be expected to know all the aspects of something like this when they have their own lives to deal with. they might get sold on some higher level of security than actually exists.

I've yet to see tommy robinson himself be a racist. He's certainly not pro lax immigration, and focuses on holding immigrants who commit crimes responsible, but thats hardly racist. 
Scrutinizing other cultures, values, and people, does not make one racist. Even if thats what you focus on, it doesn't mean you have hatred in your heart for someone of a particularly skin color or genetic background. It's got more to do with values, and law &amp; order.
@_date: 2018-11-01 23:17:26
One other question I had was whether or not you'd be integrating the ability to transact on the lightning network. Say for instance you open a channel, but with conjoined coins, I would imagine that would be a nice extra step for anonymity. I'm not really sure if this is that important or practical though.
@_date: 2019-01-06 16:40:20
I understood, the problem is that I don't think the marginal benefits out way the pain for most people to set up a full node plus a ln node. Maybe the full node is a bigger issue atm.
Point I'm making is if for the most part all we end up doing is connecting to someone else's node isn't that harming decentralization? We already have problems with miners being relatively centralized and there are very few immediately practical reasons for anyone to learn how to get a full btc mode to run. Now we have another layer which may also provide little incentive to run a lightning node.
It seems more likely that people would use a service like eclair and auto connect to one of their nodes instead which harms decentralization. But then why would they want to run the infrastructure if its not getting them much monetary benefit. Thinking about it the other way around (how much faster can this make my transactions) is a poor incentive model unfortunately, imo. 
I'd like to see this work because I've tried eclair in beta and it was amazingly fast. I'm just not sure the average person is going to be interested in the hassle.
@_date: 2018-11-01 21:37:16
Hmm, but it seems like a lot of people that might want to earn bitcoin today would be getting donations, which leaves a very big target on their backs since current addresses allow people to see just how valuable the theft would be for them. Might be a "limited" use case but still seems rather important no? It's easy for me to say though.
@_date: 2019-01-06 16:41:40
Does it outweighs the cost of electricity and time invested in setup and administration? However minimal? Because Satoshis are pretty worthless to a merchant that has what might be  perceived as a pain in the ass.

Wait, why did you ever call yourself satoshi? You know that Bitcoin itself is a libertarian software project at its roots right? The whole, uncensorable, permissionless bit? 
Also, Hitler's rise to power has less to do with speech initially, and more to do with the fact that he basically violently took control of the government. Then imposed free speech restrictions. Both run counter to libertarianism, free speech, and bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-01-06 03:40:54
I'm pretty excited about the lightning network in general, but could someone explain to me how the incentives work? It seems like the payout is so small that it wouldn't cover the cost of running a node right now, and if price increases so much that it does, would that make it unsuitable for microtransactions/coffee type purchases again?
@_date: 2019-01-06 16:42:04

i think in the future we might be able to use things like ipfs or storj and then tunnel to those networks via tor. that way your site is hosted on the decentralized cloud network, and your server could be local, and the ISP won't know whats going on at all.
@_date: 2019-01-06 05:35:02
well, without monetary incentives to run lightning, i think that right now, it probably lacks incentives for almost anyone interested who isn't super into the ideology of bitcoin like the rest of us here. That's a real problem because you can't really expect people to do something just out of the goodness of their heart. 
as far as price going up causing ln transactions becoming less suitable for microtransactions, i was thinking about routing fees going up. I imagine if anyone wants to run a node, they'd want to make money off it via fees right?
I guess unless there is some low, or almost zero cost and easy to set up way of running a node, maybe? but even then, unless everyone's LN wallets function as nodes it seems like a stretch.

well its great for microtransactions, so even with lower fees bitcoin wont be good for rapid microtransactions or rapid transactions of any kind. low fees doesn't mean LN isn't useful, its actually more useful since you're lowering the barrier to entry for using LN in the first place. Thats not to say im a proponent of larger blocks, i'd like to see smaller blocks if anything.

if it gets that high we'll just use satoshis or something. no need to abandon the actual bitcoin denomination.
@_date: 2017-10-21 17:19:43
We don't want that either. Lightning requires 2 on chain transactions, one to open a payment channel and one when it closes and tallies the fees. You still want relatively low fees.

Actually it's not wasted. Using energy for bitcoin is a feature. The reason is that it would require someone else to expend over 51% of the network's current energy output just to try and attack it. Trying to sustain that becomes more unrealistic the larger the scale more energy that's used.
It's a feature not a bug.
