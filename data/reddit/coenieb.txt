Why do you say that?  After December holidays where people spend a lot of money
@_date: 2018-01-22 14:03:04
January is a tough month. Maybe a lot of people is just selling cause they need the cash
@_date: 2018-01-22 14:15:04
Yeah i just buy more in the dips
@_date: 2018-01-22 14:03:57
Also a lot of FUD is still going around
@_date: 2018-01-16 16:21:25
Sorry for a noob question, but how does a full node help? I genuinely don't know
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:28:38
Lol  you the man
@_date: 2017-12-18 20:53:42
Take the 5k for yourself and then you can buy btc from your own account and send it to a paperwallet
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:24:54
Thank you. Any others would also be helpful
@_date: 2017-12-08 10:27:31
Wrong. Each address is linked to a single key, not each bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:28:02
Go to lujo.com fees are 1%
@_date: 2017-12-18 20:17:42
They gone
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:22:40
Also go check out Luno.com
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:20:58
Yes. Use a different exchange
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:54:06
I think it depends on your bank. Because mine took 2 hours
@_date: 2017-12-18 20:54:06
I mean how dit you buy your own BTC?
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:24:58
I personally use Luno.com, but mostly I use their app. Once you have fully verified your identity there is no limits
@_date: 2017-12-18 20:14:08
Rather take a Tesla
@_date: 2017-12-04 07:57:24
Don't understand your story
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:19:26
The whole 3rd world? Don't be ignorant
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:36:07
Actually i'm not sure. I just hate the idea people have that all 3rd world countries are shit poor. Obviously some of them are. But alot of them aren't
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:15:50
You are going to make more than from mining
@_date: 2017-12-18 20:16:01
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:28:08
1% maker fee and 0% taker fee. If your total btc trade volume for 30 days is higher than 10 btc the maker fee goes down to 0.75% and if your 30 day volume is higher than i think 100 btc the maker fee goes down to 0.5%
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:29:12
It varies unfortunately. For me it was very quick, but other people said it took a day or 2.
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:51:11
I agree. You only get taxed on capital gain so if you buy it and send it awayvsay like to a paper wallet and you don't withdraw it. You don't make any capital gain so you won't be taxed
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:09:21
Buy and HODL
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:17:02
Cashed out on Luno and got it the same day
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:18:39
I use Luno. Very user friendly
@_date: 2017-12-05 16:06:32
Luno.com is pretty good
@_date: 2017-12-05 16:04:07
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:37:08
On most exchanges/wallets I know of you can't even set the transaction fees
@_date: 2017-12-04 19:03:40
I started with Luno because they make it so easy and then I never left them, never felt the need. Been using their exchange since May
@_date: 2017-08-29 17:14:51
A lot of people get hung up on owning a whole bitcoin. This is unnecessary.  Buy a little bit at a time as you are able to and know that it has value.
@_date: 2017-08-31 12:02:05
Good for you man
@_date: 2017-08-24 12:01:48
Your reason? Genuinely interested
@_date: 2017-08-22 22:49:15
Don't stress,  just hodl. The price will go up again and past your buy price
@_date: 2017-08-30 08:37:26
South Africa, nice to meet you all
@_date: 2017-08-31 19:48:48
Maybe laminate it?
@_date: 2017-08-08 20:50:53
Their app is also very user friendly
@_date: 2017-08-07 22:21:14
@_date: 2017-08-22 23:18:51
Just don't panic sell
@_date: 2017-08-31 19:36:21
It depends if you need the money. If you sell now and afterwards the price goes up a lot, will you be fine with that or will you regret selling? on the other hand the price could dip and you could regret not selling. No one knows what will happen, but as for me, I will be holding until I need the money
@_date: 2017-08-31 19:53:54
I think your doing it wrong. sold bitcoin in the morning on a exchange and the money was in my account the next day
@_date: 2017-08-08 20:18:42
I have been using Luno.com for a couple of months now and I am very satisfied with them. 
@_date: 2017-08-30 08:45:32
@_date: 2017-11-14 19:44:41
Not really. Most people are just saying what they hear from others. But yeah there are a few people with good opinoins. Just have to sift through everything to get to them
@_date: 2017-11-21 17:19:43
Did you own bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:21:36
The one on the photo hasn't been used for what its worth. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 21:22:54
On February 9th 2011  1BTC = 1USD
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:42:19
You have to look it up on the blockchain. Whats the address then i will look it up and  post the link. It's a public address so don't worry, just don't share your private key
@_date: 2017-11-10 19:52:17
Yeah that would be nice, but i have tried to time it before and missed an opportunity.
@_date: 2017-11-20 18:18:07
I think you have given in to propaganda. There is definitely room for altcoins as well
@_date: 2017-11-17 21:04:44
Aah i see. Thanx for explaining
@_date: 2017-11-14 19:28:22
Give it a few hours, but I think most people, including me, aren't 100% sure
@_date: 2017-11-14 19:08:00
More specific info please
@_date: 2017-11-21 17:29:06
Mmm.. sorry don't know how to help. Hopefully someone else on here can help you
@_date: 2017-11-10 19:27:46
Take my like sir
@_date: 2017-11-10 19:33:04
Thanx for the clarification man
@_date: 2017-11-26 08:16:43
No one knows
@_date: 2017-11-11 15:57:55
You are correct. Please sell all your coins and quite crypto
@_date: 2017-11-21 05:58:48
I guarantee 100% a lot of new users new to crypto got confused and bought Bcash instead of bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-20 18:40:31
Exactly. They used it to pump the coin, scammed people to buy into it and then sold of all of their coins. They made a shit load of money while the people that bought in at the end lost almost everything. The sad thing is that alot of people are already brainwashed and still clings to the coin. If they just called it a different name and didn't pretent to be bitcoin it could've potentially been an ok altcoin
@_date: 2017-11-10 23:11:23
So why don't you rather f*ck off with your shit attitude and rather make a contribution. Hope you have a nice day
@_date: 2017-11-14 20:33:38
Sorry to hear that man. This was a hard lesson to learn and this will help others be careful as well. Don't let this discourage you from crypto though
@_date: 2017-11-21 17:36:15
I would like to see your site please.
My personal opinion is that people will definitely use it around Christmas to buy presents. I know i will if more sites excepts bitcoin as I don't always have fiat in my bank but I do have bitcoin
@_date: 2017-11-23 20:18:51
Yeah their instant buy and sell is expensive., but learn to use the exchange correctly then ylu can trade with zero fees. They have n 0% makers fee and a 1% takers fee. If your total 30day trade volume exceeds 10BTC the takers fee goes down to 0.75% and if your total 30 day trade volume exceeds 50 BTC the takers fee goes down to 0.5%.
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:30:31
What is your public addres? You can see if your coins are still there
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:07:54
Understandable,  are you in america or europe?
@_date: 2017-11-14 20:01:48

@_date: 2017-11-22 05:56:25
@_date: 2017-11-20 18:11:09
It depends where in the world you are situated?
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:37:16
The value differs a bit on each exchange as the price is determined by the buy and sell orders on that exchange, thus the price can be different on different exchanges. It is called arbitrage. Here is a link that explains it well. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 17:59:29
This is a very difficult question as no one really knows what the price will do. It could go up another 10 or 20% in the next month and then now would have been a great time to buy. On the other hand it could dip again.
I believe that the price will continue to grow in the long run and it's better to get in, but this is something that you have to decide for yourself as no one really knows and if someone says otherwhis, they are lying.
@_date: 2017-11-10 19:20:44
I agree. Nothing is going on, still up 50% for the last 30 days
@_date: 2017-11-12 10:43:08
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:53:36
I think you may be correct. Hopefully someone can confirm this. Good luck man. Hope you get things sorted out. Are you in the US?
@_date: 2017-11-10 18:38:23
Nothing is going on, still up 50% for the last 30 days
@_date: 2017-11-21 17:51:12
You have nice merch!
@_date: 2017-11-17 20:09:12
Google bitcoin paperwallet to see an exmple
@_date: 2017-11-17 19:30:41
Try luno.com. you can buy ethereum for a decent fee
@_date: 2017-11-20 18:15:15
Then i recommend luno.com. It is the one I am using. They also have a nice app with an nice interface and 2FA. I do all my trading there.
@_date: 2017-11-10 22:53:26
Salty much?
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:35:48
I'm not sure how poloniex work. But it's like your bitcoin "account number" Maybe someone that uses poloniex can help?
@_date: 2017-11-16 11:04:54
Sounds like a horrible idea. Never invest more than you are willing to lose. It is a huge risk, but if you are willing to take that risk, go for it
@_date: 2017-11-26 20:27:57
Same app
@_date: 2017-11-21 17:54:14
Do some more research. I am certain there are similar sites. If you find something good maybe post here for other people from US to see
@_date: 2017-11-26 08:17:44
It's in your description. Fun. So go for it and do it for fun
@_date: 2017-11-21 17:48:59
Cool thanx
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:50:06
Thats also what i am wondering. Hopefully someone with more knowledge than me can help
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:46:26
@_date: 2017-11-17 20:37:46
They also added Ethereum a week ago, but the ethereum exhange are not up yet
@_date: 2017-11-08 22:38:10
Cool man, I know that you are asking from the list but Luno.com is in Europe and they have very good security and in the previous fork they gave people that had bitcoin at the time their bitcoin cash. But if you don't want to you can just ignore this post. Hope you find what you're looking for. BITCOIN TO THE MOON!
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:54:39
Sent some coin to this address for someone to take. It's a race!
@_date: 2017-11-17 21:02:11
Then whats with this post? 
@_date: 2017-11-13 12:50:53
Stupidest thing I have read all day
@_date: 2017-11-15 08:31:54
Think you missed it
@_date: 2017-11-21 17:46:55
Depends in what country you are situated? If you are in europe, Asia or Africa,  Luno is very nice with 0% makers fee and 1% taker fee [if total 30 day volume is more than 10 BTC the takers fee goes down to 0.75% and if volume is more than 50 BTC per 30 day volume the takers fee goes down to 0.5%). Been trading on there for the last 7 months.
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:02:11
And then maybe 500$ in a few months
@_date: 2017-11-26 20:27:50
Yeah go have a look and then decide. They also have a Ethereum exchange
@_date: 2017-11-10 19:24:34
In what country are you situated?
@_date: 2017-11-10 19:54:38
Definitely the best way
@_date: 2017-11-23 18:56:51
Check out Luno.com. very nice exchange and app
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:36:59
Its a bunch of numbers and letters, for example 1HK2CQkMVjhqyhrgiTCY5syeJcv2Mxpmza
@_date: 2017-11-16 11:17:30
Then I will say go for it
@_date: 2017-11-10 18:37:31
Nothing is going on, still up 50% for the last 30 days
@_date: 2017-11-14 19:06:53
This needs to be on top of sub
@_date: 2017-11-19 20:49:34
Use luno.com Very nice wallet and exchange and they are very user-friendly, especially for first time buyers.
@_date: 2017-11-14 21:56:44
The amount of bitcoin you will be able to mine without huge amounts of computing power is negleble
@_date: 2017-11-21 18:33:12
Yeah and laminate it to protect it from damage
@_date: 2017-11-17 19:50:55
If it drops to 30, you wouldn't want to buy anymore
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:22:17
Maybe leave a present for someone?
@_date: 2017-11-14 20:29:03
And laminate it
@_date: 2017-11-20 18:34:56
They also have a zero makers fee, which means you can trade without any fees if you do it correctly. Go to their learning portal, it explains everything about bitcoin and trading and fees and such ehich makes it very nice for new users
@_date: 2017-11-12 10:16:13
Lol enjoy man!
@_date: 2017-11-21 18:02:53
Shitcoins? You mean altcoins. All altcoins aren't shitcoins. Don't get influenced by propaganda.
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:47:08
In what country are you?
@_date: 2017-11-20 18:58:14
Well considering this is the stupidest thing i've read all day, I would say very stupid.
But in all seriousness this is very risky. Never invest more than you are willing to lose, especially when it is credit, thus money you don't have.
@_date: 2017-11-26 21:26:33
Go to luno's learning portal and learn to use the exhange then you can make orders with no fees
@_date: 2017-11-20 18:26:41
I agree. People spreading propaganda saying that Bcash is the real bitcoin is just riding on Bitcoins name and misleading new investers
@_date: 2017-11-16 11:22:27
If it was me, I would spread out such an investment through some altcoins as well to minimize risk. Say for example 75% bitcoin and rest altcoins. Just my opinion
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:06:54
I feel you bro. Bought R2500 and turned it to R12000  (about 840$) wish i bought more a few months back
@_date: 2017-11-08 23:29:54
Aah I see then Luno won't work, but if you do find one let me know. Maybe I will also find use for it
@_date: 2017-11-10 23:08:07
This post doesn't mention or imply any of those two things. It references to the volatility of the coin
@_date: 2017-11-21 17:40:42
Congrats on making profit man. Remember that the more you have the more potential profit you can make
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:49:05
I am not sure if this is your personal address or the poloniex address but the current balance of that address is zero
@_date: 2017-11-06 20:01:29
Don't sell, you will kick your own ass in n few days or month
@_date: 2017-11-26 21:27:12
Only the instant buy and sell is expensive
@_date: 2017-11-17 19:31:17
They are also adding an exchange soon
@_date: 2017-11-14 19:14:53
Can you please link to your other post? Would like to see the comments there as well
@_date: 2017-11-14 19:09:22
Luno.com . They use 2FA on both their app and website.
@_date: 2017-11-14 19:49:28
How about mining some altcoins?
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:27:54
Try Luno.com mate. Very user friendly app and website
@_date: 2017-11-23 20:22:11
Check out their Learning portal. It explains everything very nicely
@_date: 2017-11-20 20:40:54
It creates a bcash wallet by default. That is whats misleading
@_date: 2017-11-26 21:25:14
Define crash
@_date: 2017-11-26 21:13:05
@_date: 2017-11-17 20:12:41
Some exhanges have a zero makers fee, thus cheapest
@_date: 2017-11-21 17:23:25
If you want to access it from a different wallet, you first have to register on that wallet and then send it to your new wallet address
@_date: 2017-11-16 11:29:57
Cool man. Good luck! Hope you make a shit ton of money
@_date: 2017-11-23 20:28:47
No worries man. Everyone was new at one time. Try to read everything in the learning portal. It really makes everything easier when you understand, like fees and such. Drop me a message if you have some questions
@_date: 2017-11-26 20:18:15
Try Luno
@_date: 2017-11-14 19:57:12
Do some research on altcoins to mine and use it to buy more bitcoin. Some are definitely profitable. There is calculators on the web you can use to determine how profitable you will be. But yeah i also get what you are saying
@_date: 2017-11-10 18:35:11
Nothing going on. Still up 50% for the last 30 days
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:47:56
Yeah use coinbase
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:42:52
 Mean the feeling when you get lucky
@_date: 2017-11-21 18:35:29
All the luck to you man! Hope that accepting bitcoin openend the door to some new customers
@_date: 2017-11-17 20:49:20
I thought the the 2x split was suspended?
@_date: 2017-11-26 21:11:59
Bitx changed their name to Luno some time ago
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:08:56
Buy and hold, even if it drops more buy again. Then wait
@_date: 2017-11-17 20:05:32
Try luno.com They have a nice wallet for beginners with and exhange as well
@_date: 2017-11-21 17:26:07
Whats your public address from the first and/or second trezor wallet?
@_date: 2017-11-26 08:23:36
Said no to what?
@_date: 2017-11-14 19:26:53
@_date: 2017-11-17 19:27:41
In what country are you?
@_date: 2017-11-10 23:09:17
Thus a rollercoaster that goes up and down fast
@_date: 2017-11-17 20:36:12
I use Luno.com and the luno app. They are the biggest BTC exchange in South Africa and they launched in Europe a couple of months back. Very secure and easy to use. They have instant buy options with an ok fee, but they have an 0% maker fee and 1% taker fee on their exhange. Have been trading on there since June and haven't had any problems
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:10:24
Yeah nothing is certain
@_date: 2017-11-20 18:06:53
You have it backwards. Buy when the price drops
@_date: 2017-11-20 18:58:49
@_date: 2017-11-25 21:36:35
Thats all you need
@_date: 2017-11-17 19:32:22
No only bitcoin and ether. They have a nice app aswel
@_date: 2017-11-21 17:27:28
HODL !
@_date: 2017-11-26 20:25:11
No card unfortunately. But they have a nice exhange and app
@_date: 2017-11-21 17:11:14
Do you have your private key?
@_date: 2018-02-15 19:31:49
Luno is also in India and Europe
@_date: 2017-10-11 12:57:27
It's luno.com
@_date: 2017-10-11 12:56:52
Sorry for taking so long to reply. It's luno.com
@_date: 2017-07-20 16:24:25
But yeah buy buy buy
@_date: 2017-07-20 15:51:36
BIP91 wil only activate after a full cycle AFTER it locks in. So if it locks in it will only activate in about a couple of days
@_date: 2017-07-19 21:17:10
I find  easy
@_date: 2017-07-21 13:00:39
I saw the email in a previous post today. Can't remember where
@_date: 2017-07-21 13:02:52
One word: Satoshi
