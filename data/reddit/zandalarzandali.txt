Funny how other countries have done juuuuuuust fine with plenty of debt. Maybe Greece was just bad at handling it ;)

No no.
This thread will continue. You are in need of medical attention, you need to go the closest psychiatrist and seek help. You have seriously mental issues. Probably Schizophrenia and psychosis.

Please no, no one wants you jerry.

Everyone upvoting you seems to conviently forget the 70s and 80s. Gov brown nearly destroyed California during those years.
Edit: What the hell are the downvotes for? I'm certainly adding to the discussion. If you are upvoting him, and downvoting me, it obviously means you like corrupt politicians who put states into massive debt. But okay, I guess was never full of intelligent people anyways.

Dude. Where the fuck are you getting the weed smoking.
I AM NOT SAYING MURPHY'S LAW IS INSANE YOU COMPLETE DUMBFUCK. Seriously, go hang yourself right now with barbed wire, you are seriously too idiotic for this world.
@_date: 2014-08-28 02:33:48
@_date: 2014-08-28 02:21:35
I'll make this more simple as well.
Now onto you,
What. The. Fuck. is wrong with you and your obsession with weed, hallucinations, and illiteracy.
@_date: 2014-08-28 02:53:05
Are you seriously fucking arguing semantics. Considering the fact that you keep talking like this, I'm positive YOU'RE the weed smoking lunatic.
@_date: 2014-02-25 02:36:32
@_date: 2014-08-28 02:17:23
You've got to be trolling, this is the only way to explain someone as deranged as you.
I actually happen to agree to your thoughts a bunch of posts ago. But I simply commented on the fact that you didn't know what murphy's law actually is(Anything with a chance of failure will fail. Not the usual, anything will go wrong). And then you start attacking me with weed smoking,  saying I said murphy's law is insane, and government regulation is wrong; none of which I ever said, nor did.
100% of what you are saying is actually completely and utterly wrong.
You're the one doing the personal attacks bub, I'm just doing observations on a mentally deranged subject.
@_date: 2014-08-27 23:20:21
I've found an interesting trend. All the people who know murphy's law never reference it. And all the people who do use it, don't know what it means and misuse it's intent.
@_date: 2014-08-28 02:29:11
I will seriously link this entire conversation to any of those subreddits and everyone will agree you are the definition of insane.
@_date: 2014-07-18 22:14:09
@_date: 2014-08-28 02:06:09
I'm done arguing with someone who acts like this.
First part, you keep thinking I said murphy's law is insane. I never said that. I said ***YOU*** are insane. Insaneity can be attributed is doing the same thing over again and expecting different results, such as what you are doing right now. Posting idiotic drivel to someone obviously smarter than you.
Never said anything about your actual argument was wrong. I was, rightfully, attacking your persona.
You're the one being personal bullshit smack-talk. You are seriously keep on with the  "weed" and asking about murphy's law being insane when I never said anything about that.
If you think I'm in my 20s, alright, I don't care what you think. I assume you are in your 70s because you are completely senile and unable to think clearly.
What is with your fixation on weed? Are you a psychopath or similar? Because psychopaths have, well, a psycotic fixation on certain things, such as your fixation on calling me a heavy weed user, and your fixation on hallucinations.
1: I don't smoke weed, never even seen weed in my life. So I'll continue posting good posts, while you continue being on an obvious troll/alt account.
2: " ". Yay, another thing you don't know what it means. None of what you've been going on about is science.
In a nice short paragraph or something, can you describe yourself and your living conditions?
@_date: 2014-01-01 15:41:45
Interesting, I might just do that.

You truly are an awesome person :)
@_date: 2014-08-27 23:31:49
Woah dude. Calm down.
It's a joke... It's a joke about how nobody knows what murphy's law really is. (If anything has a possibility of failure, it will fail). Not whatever the fuck you think it is.
@_date: 2014-08-27 23:50:18
Holy shit you're an angry person(Possibly insane...). Where the fuck are you getting weed smoking, love not war dreams and pink flowers from? And also where are you getting that I've done this multiple times. This is literally one of my first posts in this sub.
@_date: 2014-11-02 03:17:58
You're too kind~
@_date: 2014-08-28 01:40:59
Literally everything you are saying indicates you are either A, insane. Or B, supremely angry.
Why are you constantly saying I smoke weed? I don't. "You know *nothing* about me"
I'm not arguing that at all, not once did I say anything about governments beaming down on bitcoin and doing whatever. I'm saying that you don't know what murphy's law is.
I'm pretty sure you need to lay off the PCP.
@_date: 2015-01-03 21:28:52
Well the US form of free speech was intended as free speech AGAINST the government. Like "I fucking hate obama, he's a super shitty presidentsodjg'psdigh'aes;ltigjaed'zsp;gtikj" Because england would throw ya into a british prison for saying "King george is a twat"
@_date: 2014-06-29 02:27:22
Wait, governor brown not fucking up california for once? I never thought I'd see the day.
@_date: 2015-07-02 17:45:48
Some games still ignore that, like * cough * Dirt 3.
I mean, I wouldn't mind it if they let me change the language of the game, some games have amazing translations and voice actors, like TF2. But other's are horrible.
@_date: 2015-07-05 21:17:04
Use it as currency like we have for thousands of years?
@_date: 2015-07-02 17:39:47
Slightly unrelated, but I fucking hate games that auto install in French because of my desktop is in french. Maybe I don't want your shitty obviously literal translated french.
@_date: 2015-04-06 03:54:37
You should rethink your life.
@_date: 2015-03-11 21:08:26
Yep, the original thoughts always get hugely corrupted.
Look at Karl Marx and Marxism. Marx himself said he wasn't a marxist, that tells you something is wrong with marxism if the guy who it is named after disavowed it.

Well, the second and 4th technically already have happened to me... So, yeah, why not.
@_date: 2013-09-02 19:35:43
No, you are confused, I said what is correct. Deflation can be used in many different ways, one being makes the economy worse(A bubble pops, or in other words deflates) or it can mean where the dollar/whatever is worth more.
@_date: 2013-10-17 21:48:47
Oi, it's gonna take me forever, don't expect soon.
(And truth be told, I wrote this while writing ideas down, I'm not quite competent to code a game engine quite yet. I got all the ideas down, just need to learn how to program well, and bam, game. Without textures... and sound... and models... So it will take frickin forever. But expect sooner than hl3)
@_date: 2013-09-01 17:25:15
Not at all, there is a limit of bitcoins that can exist. The government can simply print more dollars, which deflates(As in reduce the value of the dollar) the economy, but they don't seem to care.
@_date: 2013-10-17 21:29:58
Oh really? Never noticed it, now that does help me out considering how big humblebundle is.
@_date: 2013-10-17 21:20:08
My game doesn't work like that, sorry!
@_date: 2013-10-17 21:40:51
@_date: 2013-10-17 21:27:46
I would imagine that as nice. But for my game, there is no in game currency. But if this game, or any other of my game ideas make it big-ish; then I will definitely try and see how I can go about virtual currencies for one of my mmo ideas.
@_date: 2013-10-17 21:25:25
@_date: 2013-10-17 21:28:14
That'd be excellent, thanks!

Was planning doing windoze/linux release both using OpenGL.
@_date: 2013-09-01 19:45:12
I could think of the correct word so I used that one. However the economy can be in a "bubble" and one can "deflate" it. Also printing more dollars than ones being destroyed "Deflates" the value of the dollar.
@_date: 2013-10-17 22:16:54
I was thinking of putting in, I dunno, a credits system(So like 500Credits=1 USD or something like that) and simply use the btc to pay for credits and you get to use the credits for in game stuff, like the auction houses and items, etc etc. How does that sound?
@_date: 2013-10-17 21:29:33
Excellent advice, thanks.
@_date: 2013-10-17 21:38:38
That means more money? I'm in :P!
@_date: 2013-10-17 21:38:23
Neat, thanks!

Want to hear about my game ideas? Of course you do!
Haven't quite decided the map size, but somewhere from 4000km^2 to 40000km^2 size map.
A renaissance Italy nation, with steampunk, clockwork punk, guns, electricity and leonardo da vinci design stuff.
A 1001 nights/arab inspired nation of mystical magic stuff.
And finally a mayaincatec nation with ancient astronaut theme.(If you ever played the game rise of legends, those exactly[working on getting a license deal with MS])
This will be an RPG where you start pretty much at the bottom of the military, you decide the fate of you, and your nation/race. Not only do you get to do killy shootem up stuff, but you can farm and be a lumberjack, passive kinda stuff. Think Elder scrolls on steroids.
Anymore questions?
@_date: 2013-08-25 00:01:21
For number 2. Do you refer yourself as el presidente? 
@_date: 2013-10-17 21:36:13
This game does not have in game purchases, but look at the comment above you and I briefly described the game. Perhaps another one of my games will be f2p.
@_date: 2013-10-17 21:26:09
Thanks for those links and what you said, this definitely will help me out :)
@_date: 2013-10-17 21:37:23
@_date: 2013-10-17 21:29:02
ooo, that's really neat.
@_date: 2013-10-17 21:39:08
Excellent idea, I will try to do that in the game after the one I want to make right now.
@_date: 2013-10-17 21:28:26
Sounds like a plan.
