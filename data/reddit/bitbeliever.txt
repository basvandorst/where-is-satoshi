I like the idea, using prices expressed in numbers extending no more than two decimal places is intuitive.

A really positive and fun way to explain Bitcoin. More video's should be made that are funny and don't use jargon.

I like the simple look and recognizable formfactor. Easy use and access is important IMO. However price seems really high and that won't help adoption, get the price down and take the long view.
@_date: 2014-06-05 12:36:55
Fuckin awesome!
@_date: 2015-01-19 13:22:10
Why is the price hovering around $200 at the moment? Is it really being pushed down by a single entity unloading (mined or scammed) coins?
