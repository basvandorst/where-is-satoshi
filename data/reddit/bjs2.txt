They don’t allow deluges of new users. They make it hard to sign up, get verified and start trading. 
With coinbase on the other hand I found the app on the App Store, downloaded it and had placed orders all within 5 minutes.

2/3 no longer accept it so...

And soon might be again

Your argument is that bitcoin is going to skyrocket in price and that it’s the king? 
Wow, so compelling....
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:59:07
Is it the time to buy though?? 
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:36:39
I hope so!!

It’s literally too unstable to be used as currency. Pretty ironic.

No, pretty sure he does. And he just tore it apart.

That’s only true for the moment. The entire market is being decoupled from bitcoin more and more every day.

Won’t be the case for long. Soon you’ll be able to buy any coin with USD

How do you know that reason isn’t irrational speculative inexperienced investors?
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:11:54
Yeah and I don’t understand the value of it if this is true. 
@_date: 2018-02-09 13:18:15
Sure, I never said that spending more to like than buying made sense. 
But you have to take the future value into account 
@_date: 2018-02-08 23:54:12
The future value could make it well worth it
