MAPS is aimed at treating veterans who already have PTSD what the fuck are you on about
@_date: 2018-01-11 09:13:52


Yeah because that does a lot for the veterans already suffering. And the guy linked you a studying proving it works I'm sure you're happy to deny cannabis to children having seizures too.

Went from like 10 cents a coin to 10k a coin in 9 years, need I say more?

Poor sentient robots, oppression is still at large

Other investors die inside when they see Bitcoin make changes of like 10%+ 20%+ in a day sometimes even more, it's not uncommon for Bitcoin to see a 100% return. When do stocks do that? They probably go up or down 1-2% a week-month. 'Investors' with their multiple investments that barely change a percentile, Crypto investors are the real smart ones.
Stocks are only feasible if your a millionaire, Bitcoin will make you a millionaire

Do you not give a fuck about war veterans? You sad person.

It's called wishful thinking, the probability of it becoming a reality is statistically unlikely but nobody can be certain of the future. Ever.

In 9 years BTC went from 10 cents to 10k it's not crazy
@_date: 2019-07-09 21:37:12
Our coin is superior to copycats c:
@_date: 2019-07-10 13:21:18
Nobody know's that. It could become a universal currency. Everyone would've called you crazy when it was worth 200$ to say it will hit a thousand nevermind ten thousand, believe me I remember. You're just the same.
@_date: 2019-07-10 14:14:26
Gold is only valuable because we give it value. In the same way we give Bitcoin value -.- 
Salt was worth a lot once too thus gold can become obsolete just like technology (which is on a rapid upwards trend not downwards)
An example of where Bitcoin could become worth tons is if someone or multiple people acquired a significant portion of the market percentage selling their coin for no less than millions and at this point it could be a common currency used in multiple countries (i'm talking like 2050) anyway Bitcoin is used as a currency right now in Venezuela where as their bank notes and paper currency are on the floor now worthless.
I don't see them trading with gold coins in Venezuela mate.

Except price superiority lmao
TFW BTC hits 13k again
@_date: 2019-07-09 22:38:39
It just shows that trading stocks and investing in Bitcoin is not the same. Bitcoin is more harsh, you might lose all your money if you buy at a high but god damn the returns are ridiculous. Not comparable to stocks even slightly.
Maybe comparable to if you invested in stocks in Apple, Google or Microsoft in the 90's. Also you'd be surprised, lots of rich people now have some of their assets in Bitcoin which is funny its usually the ones who were calling it a scam.
An example is Mark Cuban, called it the biggest scam known to man but now he recommends everyone invests about 10% of their money into it
Bitcoin could be worth like 1mil a coin in 10 years, heck it could be worth 10-100 mil. No one knows. That's the beauty of it. 
Shit coins will be left in the dust.

The rates will always be inflated since the person selling the bitcoin assumes the risk
@_date: 2018-09-13 17:41:10
Barclays are actually known to close bitcoin traders bank accounts too
@_date: 2018-09-13 18:30:15
Weird, maybe they get pissed off if you use anything other than coinbase.
@_date: 2018-08-20 19:22:52
Had nothing but positive experiences with them but I'm pretty shook now, I'll see how this plays out.
@_date: 2014-09-30 19:12:11
Yep all good now. Scared me because I literally just deposited £300.

Silkroad 2 was ran by morons, not to mention they have the stigma of Silkroad.
The goverment think Silkroad is an icon and therefore will attack it. Little do they know Agora and Evo has always been better and always will.
The closure of Silkroad 2 is a good day for the Darknet, good to see the scummy scam out of the brilliance that is the darknet.

No the question mark is just there for no reason
@_date: 2019-06-15 16:49:08
I mean you could've mined for a few hrs and got 10k BTC right back then?
@_date: 2019-06-15 12:27:55
Honestly no one can say anything because bitcoin had very little value then, it was people like him making the first purchases for real world objects that allowed bitcoin to prosper into what it is today.
Still that's an expensive pizza
@_date: 2019-06-15 17:50:04
Fun fact it was originally over 8000 but it was mistranslated to 9000
@_date: 2019-06-26 10:10:30
A 100% change on a stock is crazy as fuck very rare, Bitcoin doubling in value is just another Tuesday
@_date: 2019-06-15 18:48:15
Just put a comma after right and before back then it'll make sense. Maybe practise reading comprehension not everyone has time to spell out fucking grade 5 English and Grammar for you
@_date: 2015-08-06 01:49:56
You're an idiot.
@_date: 2019-06-15 12:17:24
Never forget the guy who paid 10k BTC for a pizza in 2010
@_date: 2017-11-27 22:58:41
Who says AI don't like BTC
@_date: 2019-06-15 12:41:45
Yeah of course it does dude I'm not disagreeing read my first three words they literally god damn agree with you.
It was expensive an expensive pizza because if I trade a 2k Rolex for a 5k car and that Rolex goes on to be worth 100k then yes I still paid a lot for the car maybe not at the time but someone else clearly benefited more from that trade than the other this is just simple logic

If you know anything about bitcoin you know that it's the answer to everything

Oh look my biggest regret in life
@_date: 2019-04-28 12:31:44
The thing is if someone takes my phone and goes on a spending spree at least I can call my bank and possibly get the money back. 
Bitcoin is permanent once sent, which is beneficial in one regard.
@_date: 2019-04-28 12:45:22
Not really an issue with Bitcoin that can be fixed, look on the bright side you can receive donations or provide services without having to worry about people charging back. 
You can basically charge back anything with PayPal which is a disaster for the seller
@_date: 2015-07-05 22:19:11
Bare in mind while the prices are higher its harder to cash out. Especially big amounts.
@_date: 2019-04-28 12:50:41
What's stopping you from having a HODL wallet where your details are never exposed and you can put most your wealth in and a wallet you use on your phone for buying shit?
The biggest problem with Bitcoin that stops people from putting more than a small % of their spendable money in it is that you can't put 20k in it and expect it to stay at 20k lol imo
@_date: 2018-03-31 08:57:26
The BBC kinda have really really strong restrictions and policies against showing bias. It's not the fucking daily mail mate, which is something you'd probably read.
@_date: 2018-03-27 10:49:00
Back then no one really worried about big busts or the feds cracking down, Ross had terrible OPSEC but so did everyone else. It just wasn't seen as a necessity back then. Heck people were buying drugs through AOL and PayPal few years before.

Nah because even if it goes from 6k to 12k you literally make 30 euro which is nothing.

It's like the first plane bruh, you think people were willing to believe they could fly in the sky? People always call it a scam at first

Very true I learnt about BTC when they were less than hundred a piece. Rip me
