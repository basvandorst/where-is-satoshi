1- Bitpay invoices (and their 15m countdown of stress) no longer provide a BTC address to send your BTC to. They provide a bitcoin URI, like this:
 
2- change the url to THIS, and paste that into any browser and you will get the ACTUAL BTC address to send to.
 
 (YOUR ID)
so thus:
see my post below for why this is important to all who care about security,  and why it is important to me.

Very surprised, impressed to get doc posted on bitpays KB from this reddit (good).    But today is a perfect example of why bitpay forcing Payment Protocol is a very dangerous precident / slippery slope:
1- you are now requiring (proper security conscientious) users to fire up a web browser in their liveOS session (ideally in tails).  No big deal right,  its just a single url you need to access, right? 
(javascript can access RPC electrum daemon, to grab your wallet across internet)
or see:  
(in all fairness,  thanks to tails liveOS' very restrictive/secure setup i know the default tor browser does not have permissions to access any part of the file sys outside of its tor-browser folder,  thus (pls correct if i wrong),  i would assume that this type of JS exploit would fail on tails live, as it wouldnt be able to access the wallet file (since its in a location tor browser executable cant read  + default is disabled all JS on TBB on Tails live).  
however,  to see how the problem/logic is circular here,  bc tails is very restricted/secure,  this makes it VERY difficult to upgrade software while on tails liveOS  (ie it would be nice to upgrade from the electurm 2.6.x which is included in tails 3.3, to electurm 3.0.4 simply as more recent electurum versions are better at handling payment protocol URIs).    When i first saw this bitpay Payment protocol uri requirement (ie when i **wasnt** getting a btc address on an invoice for the first time) , the first thing i thought was-  i now need to use something like ubuntu live CD or centos live cd now, so that i can (easily) install a new/more recent copy of electrum.
I didnt like this idea at all,  and **had** i gone that route, i would have possibly been exposed to the javascript/electrum issue (as those non tails live OSs dont partition file sys access like tails does, which is a BIG deal in this electrum vuln situation - to be clear, u also have to visit a site  with the JS ofcouse (**or be shown an ad containing**).
I dont understand why Bitpay cant just whitelist all tor Exit nodes RE: CloudFlair issues blocking the URI http requests for users , using tor.  I get that alot of crap/ddos to bitpay prob. flows through tor,  but tor is pretty slow thus that should serve as a throttle on the amount of ddos / other issues that will also be whitelisted.    
** Additionally,  Tails OS + Tor must be added  to bitpay's test suite PRIOR to any changes / updates, to avoid issues like all this.**
