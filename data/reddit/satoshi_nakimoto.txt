Mike Hearn was asked about whether or not he would give control of XT to Gavin in the last ten minutes or so of the Epicenter Bitcoin interview. I don't have the full response written out, but it's long and I don't remember it containing the word "yes."
@_date: 2015-06-28 17:13:39


It's controlled by a group of people, and they're against the switch to XT and implied hard fork.
On the other hand, bitcoin.com is controlled by Roger Ver. I haven't heard his opinions about XT. Maybe some of the XTers should talk to him. It seems like having bitcoin.com would be even better than bitcoin.org.
Edit: Plus I heard btc.com might be available.
@_date: 2015-06-17 15:42:32
A fork is inevitable at this point. Neither side is going to give in. Neither side is required to give in. I'm resigned to there being (at least) two chains. That's almost certainly bad news for the value, but on the bright side you'll get to dump your coins twice (at least!).
@_date: 2015-06-28 17:01:38
I've seen some of those core devs comment that bigger blocks would actually help blockstream. That would seem to prove your accusation incorrect.
But everyone knows you're not making it because you think it's correct.
By the way, "for profit company" doesn't sound evil to many bitcoiners. "MIT" is questionable (think of Aaron Swarz). "Google" is the evil neoStasi.
@_date: 2015-06-17 16:15:31


This is happening in both directions. On the other side people point to Luke Jr., or attribute nefarious motives to the core devs connected to Blockstream. It's unfortunate.
Whatever someone thinks about raising the cap or about Mike Hearn's past statements, the video in which he says he would proceed with a hard fork even with a minority of the hashing power was shocking. After having some time to think about it, I'm resigning myself to the idea that there will be two chains.
@_date: 2015-06-15 18:47:19
In the video it didn't seem like you (Mike Hearn) were asked about the scenario. You brought up the worst case scenario yourself:


The hosts asked for some elaboration and that's when you brought up miners in China and checkpoints.
To be fair, it was a live interview and people make mistakes. But you spooked some people. The idea of XT forking even with a minority of the hash power was unthinkable. Not anymore.

It's funny what gets downvoted. It obviously has more to do with who made the comment and what "team" they're on rather than what was said.
But let them downvote. It's less damaging than if they start learning to code.
@_date: 2015-06-16 19:56:44
Context matters. Before the part talking about checkpoints, Hearn introduced the worst case scenario himself:


This was part of his response to the following "question" from one of the hosts:


After Hearn introduced this "worst case scenario" he elaborated that if the "economic majority" is in favor of switching to XT, but the mining majority is not, then the "economic majority" will win. One method to ensure that the "economic majority" will win is checkpoints.
@_date: 2015-06-17 15:48:55
One advantage of cryptocurrency protocols is their resistance to attacks. It's a matter of perspective whether what we're witnessing is resistance to an attack or an inability to adapt/upgrade.
I don't think you'll have to leave, though. It looks like there will be an XT-chain, one way or another. I suspect there will be Core-chain as well, and two communities that really don't like each other anymore. It's not the end of the world.
@_date: 2015-06-28 17:04:12
Interesting point. I was more surprised to read that Gavin adopted cypherdoc2.
@_date: 2015-06-28 16:48:18
I've seen no real evidence that those who want to hard fork to lift the block size limit are the majority. I've seen a lot of evidence that those in favor have *convinced themselves* they're a majority, but that's not the same thing. The last time I looked at xtnodes.com the XT nodes were less than 3%.
And before anyone goes there: yes, I'm relatively new to reddit, and yes I haven't posted much. That seems to be important to some people for some reason. I don't think spending a lot of time on reddit is something anyone should be proud of. To quote Arlo Guthrie: "I'm not proud. Or tired."
@_date: 2015-06-17 16:09:00
Currently 2.2%. Another 47.9% will indicate an "economic majority" and the 20MB XT-fork can proceed.
@_date: 2015-06-17 17:01:10
I suspect we've only scratched the surface of how scorched the Earth will become. This isn't shaping up to be a no-fault divorce.
@_date: 2015-06-28 16:54:58
Yes. At this point enough of the mining pools have explicitly said they're not switching to XT. It's an empty threat at the moment. But I'm trying to be charitable to the people making it. They're obviously frustrated that they're not getting their way.
@_date: 2015-08-04 05:11:01


There are far more people who own no bitcoins than people who own bitcoins. When bitcoiners try to argue "only those with bitcoin have a say," anti-bitcoiners will compare it to when only property owners had the right to vote.

If XT does not get its 75%, Hearn will use checkpoints to fork anyway.
@_date: 2015-08-16 20:47:26
The longest *valid* chain, where validity is defined by the protocol. The white paper definitely doesn't talk about using voting to change the definition of *valid*. The "one cpu one vote" is describing mining, not voting on protocol changes.
(In case someone objects, technically it's not the "longest" chain -- but the chain with the most proof of work.)
@_date: 2015-08-16 19:33:54
Maybe there's a way to use getutxos to attack XT. Food for thought.
@_date: 2015-08-21 08:00:51


There is nothing in the white paper or in the Bitcoin code that says 51% can change the definition of when a block is valid. In fact, there is nothing that says 51% can make any decision regarding the network and protocol. I'm not sure why you think otherwise. The only reference to 51% is the notion of a 51% attack which would allow 51% of miners to control the block chain, but the block chain they control would still have to follow the protocol rules.
@_date: 2015-08-11 05:43:43


The general definition of "hard fork" does not contain a figure of 75%.
I agree the version of XT being released triggers a hard fork at 75%, but that's a very specific case. If XT does not reach this 75% threshhold (as I believe it won't), then the a newer version of XT could lower the threshhold or put in a checkpoint. (There is some discussion of these options already.) If that happens, it will still be a hard fork.

If the XT chain kills the Core chain, Bitcoin has failed.
@_date: 2015-08-16 19:26:33
Frankly, I think XTers have a lot of nerve to expect the core devs they demonized to work on their coin. Especially the ones who work for Blockstream. The work Blockstream is doing, for example, would apply just fine to many altcoins. I guess if XT decides they want side chains or a lightning network they can get their genius supporters on reddit to code it.

Yes, certainly Mike Hearn has a reputation for trying to avoid centralisation. /s
@_date: 2015-08-16 19:19:16
What do you even mean? Before the chain forks there's one chain. After the chain forks you won't be able to send Bitcoins onto the XT chain any more than you could send litecoins onto the Bitcoin chain.
@_date: 2015-08-16 18:34:36


It's unfortunate, but frankly I think your attitude is common and part of what's brought us to this divorce. It was probably unrealistic to have a single cryptocurrency with a community that includes both libertarian types and those who love strong centralised authority. It's inevitable that some of us will want to use bitcoin in a permissionless fashion, not even connecting it with our identities. Others will want to have powerful leaders keep them safe, even if that means whitelisting addresses by associating them with passports. It's easy to imagine the queue to use CoinbaseXT ending up like going through the TSA. And most of you will be happy about it.
Perhaps the best outcome of this crisis would be two different chains where most libertarians go with Core and most progressives go with XT. It's obvious we can't live together. Congratulations on getting your strong leader in Hearn. I'm sure he'll keep you marching *forward* into the *future*. He'll make good *progressive* decisions for your coin and won't have to deal with all those evil dumb superstitious *reactionaries*. Please have your passports ready.
@_date: 2015-08-25 08:24:04
While raising the 21M cap would hurt those who hold bitcoin, the argument will be made that they shouldn't have the only vote. People will say that only allowing stakeholders to vote is like only allowing property owners to vote in elections. I don't think raising the 21M cap would hurt miners; on the contrary, the halvings hurt miners. The cap doesn't affect their profit model of exchanges.
I'm 100% against raising the 21M cap, but it's easy to imagine it happening. I thought the best argument against it is that such changes to the protocol weren't possible (since everyone would agree "it isn't Bitcoin"). Now I see people saying changes to the protocol should be determined through a political process. If political processes determine the protocol, the 21M cap is doomed.
@_date: 2015-08-16 19:15:46
There is big government language being used by XT supporters -- talking about *progress* and how people are holding back *progress*. But that's the tip of the iceberg. Gavin's an open Democrat, and Hearn's talked about wanting to connect Bitcoin usage to passports.
At this point, my attitude towards XTers is simple: good riddance.
@_date: 2015-08-16 20:12:13
Miners could refuse to include transactions involving addresses that aren't whitelisted. The whitelisting process would include KYC/AML. To be honest, I think this is likely to happen eventually if there isn't a technical way to prevent it. It would probably even be politically popular.
@_date: 2015-08-16 18:39:45


XTers need to lie. It's the main method of argument they have.
@_date: 2015-07-24 14:00:53
Is Garzik on board with XT? I know he has proposals for how to increase the block size, but jumping from Core to XT is different.

@_date: 2015-08-16 19:20:29
And those of us still on the Core chain will have two words for the XTers: good riddance. I'm looking forward to this coming to an end.
@_date: 2015-07-24 14:06:56
It's impossible to say, but... Many of the commenters here who want to raise the block size limit are writing poisonous comments about the core developers. I have a hard time believing they'll remain in the community if they "lose" this battle. They seem to be already convinced they are the "economic majority," and I doubt they'll accept evidence to the contrary. Some of them might leave crypto altogether. Others might migrate to an alt coin. I think there's a very real possibility that they will simply fork the Bitcoin block chain without a majority of the miners. (Hearn's discussed this possibility.) The one possibility I find it very difficult to imagine is them saying: Oh well, I guess I'll keep using Bitcoin even though *evil profiteering core devs* have successfully *crippled* it.
@_date: 2015-08-16 19:37:35


Hmm. I don't remember voting on protocol changes being in the white paper.
@_date: 2015-08-25 08:33:28
Excellent article. I have the same assessment of the likelihood of the four possible outcomes, this being the most likely:


However, I'm not sure what a "reasonable time" is. Essentially as long as XT is considered a viable alternative for a percentage of the community, they will keep running it. They will wait for the "crash landing" assuming that 75% will be reached at that time. This means we will have a long time (maybe months, maybe years) with XT hanging like a *Fork of Damocles* over Bitcoin. It's hard to imagine such a period being positive for Bitcoin.

I know the story from the book *A. J. Ayer: A Life* by Ben Rogers. I searched for a website that had a short description of the incident.


Here you have a good point and I agree. There's no real details on to what degree he was either pestering or assaulting Naomi Campbell. I'm not inclined to give Mike Tyson the benefit of the doubt in this regard. There's very strong evidence that Mike Tyson is both violent and a rapist. It's cool that he's endorsing Bitcoin though. Maybe next we can get endorsements from Roman Polanski and Jeffrey Epstein. Too bad Jimmy Saville is dead.

What specifically did I assert that is "entirely misleading"? I quoted the article. Part of it describes how a Jewish journalist was beaten and ejected from a Galloway rally. Another part talked about how Galloway was using the clan structure to gather votes in groups, following a model similar to elections in Pakistan.
Please note that at the Galloway rally, the man said "Get out, you fucking Jew," not "Get out, you fucking Israeli." Of course being Jewish and being pro-Israel are 2 different things. (Why do you think I conflated them?) Many Jews in Israel don't support many Israeli policies. Many non-Jews outside Israel do support those policies. This makes it all the more obvious when a Jew is attacked and called a "fucking Jew" that it isn't about Israel.

You're correct, of course. But MineForeman's opinion is that of the vast majority. Rape/theft by the government isn't rape/theft.
There's no benefit to debating it. Just keep in mind that the world is filled with dangerous people like MineForeman who want to impose their view of the world onto free people, stealing their labour and putting them into rape cages. Bitcoin is a tool for avoiding those people, not convincing them.

CDS are hardly "financial terrorism." The problem was the socialisation of losses, not the underlying instruments that were being traded. Demonization of derivatives has been pushed to try to get more government control over the derivative market. Equating it with "terrorism" usually helps such movements.
On a positive note, I'm happy at least that these kind of attacks on Blythe Masters are the same kind of attacks levied against men in similar positions (e.g., from the same article, on Jamie Dimon).
Whatever one thinks of CDS's, listen to Blythe Masters for 10 minutes and listen to Max Keiser for 10 minutes. It's obvious who's intelligent and who's an idiot.

More like 1.6%. I've never seen the count reach 4%. It will likely rise after the version with the hard fork is released, but I doubt they'll ever reach 50%. It's not a reliable metric in any case. If they start getting close to 50%, people against the XT fork can simply run more Core nodes. It'll be fun to watch the number of full nodes increase just to try to win this "vote". My only concern is what may happen as more and more of the XT crowd realize they're in an echo chamber.

If they know who you are and know you have bitcoins, they can and will take them. Look at the Burt W situation. They will invade your home. They will threaten you with prison to get your private keys. That's just the beginning. Governments and their supporters don't respond to economic downturns by recognizing they are wrong. They target enemies to blame. In the 30s it was those holding gold. Now it will likely be crypto. And many of the replies on this thread should make it perfectly clear: the majority will support the government in this sick game. Even possibly the majority of bitcoiners.
The government and its supporters/excusers (the majority of people) are your enemies. Do not trust them. Tell them now how your bitcoins got hacked or how you otherwise lost them. Because they're coming for you. Make no mistake. They're coming for you. And you're not going to look any more sympathetic than "gold hoarders" in the 30s.

You're right. I suspect an accidental fork due to some unclear semantics of C++ is probably one of the biggest threats to Bitcoin. I can imagine ways to eventually fix this using formal methods, but they'd be time consuming and expensive.

I agree, but I think this kind of "bit-exactness" is only possible in two ways:

2. You get lucky.

I was surprised by this claim, so I doublechecked. Something's wrong. I agree that at the bottom of the coinmarketcap page you linked it says the total market cap is about 6.7 billion USD (now: "Total Market Cap: $ 6,699,327,067"). However, I copied all the market caps in the list and it summed to about 3.7 billion USD. If the 3.7 billion USD figure is accurate, then Bitcoin is still approximately 90% of the total market cap. I suspect coinmarketcap has a bug, but I'm open to other explanations.
Edited to add: If you look at  which lists all 635 "cryptos" (including questionable ones like Ripple) the total market cap is given at the bottom as 4 billion USD. So I seriously think the 6.7 billion USD figure is reported due to a bug.
