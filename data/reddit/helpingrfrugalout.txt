How is this bad news?

One scam last year was the ticker on bitcoin.coms website in upper right hand side.  It lists BCH and BTC with a up or down arrow representing price movement. 
When BCH went down, there was never a red down arrow. So it gave the illusion that BTC was going down
They also released a wallet, publishing as a Bitcoin wallet designed to raise awareness to BCH for the new users. It set BCH as the default sending address and forced the creation of a BCH wallet.
My favorite was on Reddit though. (the typo) was created. It contained one link and was locked. The link had something along the lines of “for Bitcoin go to but when you click on the link it goes to There as a huge outrage and the owner fixed the misleading link, but then added a few links against Bitcoin.

Consider this "merger" as if Paupal purchased a company called Bitcoin. In this case the company was free, and provides a massive tested secure payment processing  "back end". The same reason Apple purchased Beats. And why countless other bigger companies merge with smaller ones. There's immense value in using something  that is already developed vs building something from the ground up.  PayPals fees more than cover any losses to claims, so charge backs are a moot point. That's already factored into their pricing model.

It will stabilize things for sure. My gox was at the root of multiple massive sells/crashes, the source or poor news reporting, and of course lots of scandals.. This can only be a good thing

Same issue - Is it possible to see every wallet addresses ever used in Bittrex?

I’m unable to tell if he can. These were initial probing questions and the response was bit alarming: “LlIFO and FIFO are inventory valuation methods. If you sold all of your inventory, you have no choice in the calculation of your gains. Inventory valuation methods only apply to what’s still on hand, not on what was sold.”

Bittrex reporting is missing a transactions, including deposit and withdraw history for multiple wallets. This seems very fishy. Tech support is unresponsive. Does anyone have a contact or escalation path to get help?

My cpa doesn’t seem to understand crypto valuation methods. He states that it’s for inventory and we cannot choose. I have everything calculated perfectly using coin tracking.info. What’s the best guidance I can send his way about lifo vs fifo?

In my house only 1 person would use the Internet at a time... with a 14.4kbps modem ;) ... and we couldn’t use the house phone or receive calls while on the net.
