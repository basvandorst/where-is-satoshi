You could also just use other coins for a lot less.

I have it installed in Ubuntu, I think via [pip], how do I update it there?

I wish I was Californian just so I could call to have her voted out.
@_date: 2018-01-09 19:24:21
I see. Thank you.
@_date: 2018-01-09 19:16:09
If I may ask, what exactly is it you've done? do you just keep buying more of one coin?
@_date: 2018-01-12 18:36:38
Same here. Everyone is confusing the terms now.
@_date: 2018-01-10 21:02:36






I mean, I just processed a Litecoin transaction a couple days ago for a couple cents.








I meant as a solution, not a frontend. There is no front end. Is it not simpler to just send from address A to address B instead of doing...all of this?








Kind of like how the tech market is now. Sure, you could sell your stuff on a bunch of websites, but most people just go to ebay. You could get email from anywhere, but the majority of people just Gmail. Instead of being decentralized by default, it seems like it lead to eventual centralization no matter what.
@_date: 2018-01-10 23:20:46
Ah, that is structurally different. Yet still it does not really sound decentralized or peer-to-peer.
@_date: 2018-01-10 20:47:42
No matter how many times I see it explained to me, I cannot see the point. It seem ridiculously over complicated and centralized. I don't see why I can't just send someone a different coin. Don't most other coins work fine without Lightning network? 
@_date: 2017-12-19 05:08:54
Hunh. Okay. So, where can one experience these lowered fees when buying bitcoin? I bought 43 dollars of bitcoin on localbitcoins.com and I only got about 23 dollars after fees. Now I can't move it out.

If I installed Electrum a couple months ago, does that count as a "segwit wallet"?
@_date: 2017-12-19 04:49:39






Wait, THAT's whats happening? I thought it had just not been fully implemented yet. Why has it not been adopted by them?
@_date: 2014-07-01 05:20:32
It was dumb that they made it illegal in the first place.
@_date: 2014-07-22 16:01:18
Can someone explain to me why this new regulation is so popular when this point of Bitcoin is to not be regulated money?
@_date: 2014-07-30 02:56:53
Can someone explain to me why Bitcoin is to be regulated? I don't get it. I always thought that the point of Bitcoin was to have an unregulated currency but now this is happening? Should I switch to Litecoin?
@_date: 2014-05-16 17:53:01
Oh, wait, so it's just certain ones? Not just .edu address? Lame.
@_date: 2014-07-18 12:22:09
Wait, I thought the point of Bitcon was that is was not to be regulated /or/ could not be regulated? I am honestly confused here.
@_date: 2014-08-18 00:47:37
This guy know his shit. Without source code there is no means by which to trust it. It would contain your freakin money. Not a good idea unless there's such a thing as an OSS SIM card. Is there?
@_date: 2014-07-01 03:32:44
Thank you!
@_date: 2014-05-13 20:24:00


Wait, what? Is it really that cheap?

Wow, closed source OSX guys are finally catching up to open source Linux guys. Took them long enough considering we've been doing this for a few years now.

Well there's my 'Facist statement of the day' for September 17, 2014.
@_date: 2014-07-01 06:15:18
Shit really? That can't be legal?
@_date: 2014-04-21 17:03:18
Bitmessage uses OpenSSL, which researchers have been telling people not to use since before Heartbleed happened, and scaling issues. It's a great concept, but waaay not ready yet.

Shit, really? I make arrows and would love to sell them. Did you use a guide to get it working? What hardware are you running it on?

So if Paypal freezes it, then does the money go back to the people who wanted to donate it? Or does Paypal steal it?
@_date: 2014-07-01 00:20:09
Lol, at this point all I have is 30 cents in Bitcoin, so I hope so.

I would totally strip for money but I'm a dude and no one wants to pay for that.
@_date: 2014-07-01 03:32:51
Thank yoU!

I don't get why everyone is posting about the Apple smartwatch. There have been smartwatches for quite a while now.
@_date: 2014-10-01 23:50:01
How do you define Agorism?
@_date: 2014-06-07 20:51:01
Wow, thank you so much!
@_date: 2014-05-16 17:51:22
Wait, Coinbase is doing that???
@_date: 2014-04-21 23:14:40
@_date: 2014-09-02 17:42:35
What? It's open source.
@_date: 2014-07-20 01:39:52
Ok. We have to fight this. How?
@_date: 2015-05-30 08:07:47
That's more than some killers get.

I'm going to hijack the top comment here to spread something relevant. Byzantium Linux is a flavor of Linux that is in itself a mesh node. Used on more than one machine and you have a meshnet going. You can have a meshnet going as fast as you can boot Byzantium. 
@_date: 2014-06-04 14:56:20
You're fucking brilliant.
@_date: 2015-01-08 01:53:49
Really? Like what?
@_date: 2017-03-08 03:37:13
Well yes, but this has been public since the Snowden documents.
@_date: 2019-04-28 15:08:17
I've never heard of bluetooth being used like this. Neat.

What can I buy there? What do they sell? I don't live very far from Portsmouth if that's where it is.
@_date: 2018-04-11 16:05:26
You shouldn't. I met a guy in bar who gave me about 30 USD worth of Litecoins for an older model iPod I was selling. I don't know about all of you, but I actually am using it as a currency.
@_date: 2013-03-24 20:02:28
This. No closed source stuff for us, thanks.
@_date: 2013-07-12 01:12:53
Alpaca socks!
@_date: 2013-07-15 16:37:47
Okay, for the uninitiated, what's it do?
