It's a wallet generator. You go to the website and it gives you private keys (generated on your browser).
It's recommended to use such scripts offline (or just use other solutions).
However, it have JavaScript code sending the private keys to the mothership.

Meanwhile, the site does not work for an unknown reason. Perhaps it's a coincidence that a cat has gone through the server's administrator's keyboard?

Look [this code]( Did not tested it with the latest Electrum.
Electrum (the version I tested back then) is calculating the addresses from the MPK differently than other wallets.
(However, it's maybe better to use another library, this is not regularly updated. My code is still not merged. I did not used that code in production, just wrote it to demonstrate that Electrum is using different algorithm.)

You can do this with ProxyChains.
You can add several proxies:

Of course this application should be used only on secure computers.
And the secret keys should be backed up securely.
You can store your secret keys somewhere secure and enter them in the app only when needed, then delete them from the browser.
Or you can save the app within the encrypted container and write the secret keys within the script:
    addAccount('alice 'your secret code');
    addAccount('alice2 'your secret code 2');
    addAccount('alice3 'your secret code 3');
Open code.js and search for "addAccount".
If you use some old laptop with Ubuntu, you can use Ubuntu's encrypted home directory feature to protect the secret keys.

I did not know that the last word is a checksum. How this checksum is calculated?
I thought that only hexadecimal version of the seed have checksum. Are you sure that mnemonic code have a checksum too?

If you are paranoid you can make secure seed using dice. (If you think that PRNG is not good enough.)
You can make the seed without computer - just print the lists and throw your dice. (Or save the paper and watch the lists on your monitor. And don't use the search feature.)
If you throw several dice at once, be careful not to pick smallest/biggest number first - for example, throw them in a box and enter their values in left-to-right sequence.

I just tested with Electrum 1.9.8 and it accepts list of random words with random last word ("restore wallet"). So, It looks like there is no checksum for the mnemonic version of the seed.
I tested these lists:
    nightmare hit verse arrive shiny sunlight loose ghost jealous woman felicity clay
    nightmare hit verse arrive shiny sunlight loose ghost jealous woman felicity hit
    nightmare hit verse arrive shiny sunlight loose ghost jealous woman felicity nightmare
The last word is different and it works.

Relative to first random number.
Why just adding number is not good idea: 


I changed it: "there is a little decrease of randomness".
But when adding numbers like this, there is no decrease in randomness (change in distribution):
    $maybe_random = irand($maximum); # random integer between 0 and $maximum-1
    $other_random_number = irand($maximum); # random integer between 0 and $maximum-1
    $really_random = $maybe_random + $other_random_number;
    $really_random = $really_random % $maximum;
But when $other_random_number is human generated, I am not sure...
This should work well:
    $maybe_random = irand($maximum); # random integer between 0 and $maximum-1
    $other_random_number = 1 + irand(6); # random integer between 1 and 6 - can be generated with dice
    $really_random = $maybe_random + $other_random_number;
    $really_random = $really_random % $maximum;


I don't want to rely only on dice. Because dice are not perfect.
Also Electrum is accepting only some words. Word list from [diceware]( is different than word list of Electrum.
@_date: 2014-09-24 18:52:54
For Electrum 2.x words are 2047 (according to BIP39).

Because you are using telephone (SMS) based 2FA.
The other option is to use 2FA with TOTP (no SMS required - the codes are computed locally).

You can use this JavaScript based application: 
It runs on every new browser.
The code is here:
On Mozilla Marketplace:
You should use it only on secure computers (you need to be sure there is no malware - i.e. clean Linux distro). Also you should copy it locally and turn the browser "Offline"  (File -&gt; Work Offline) just in case. You can use some old laptop or tabled without Internet access only for offline stuff (like making 2FA codes). You can buy some cheap used tablet for this.

I researched online for the best practices to mix random numbers. As far as I know it is the XOR. 
I wrote [this script]( to be used by "tinfoil hat" users for generating random sequences of words. They can be used for strong passphrases (which are easier to write/read/speak-over-the-phone  than `p$Wa;%"6'i[afa"TKl-N `) and Electrum/BIP39 seeds (tested with Electrum 2.9.2, not generating valid checksum, so it does not work for wallets that require it).
For encrypting private keys with a serious key stretching: 
The key stretching used by most security-related applications is too weak.
Edit: added the missing link to the script.
@_date: 2017-08-20 22:22:31
I made this script: 
You can use the diceware-like lists or the script to mix your random numbers and computer-generated random numbers.
