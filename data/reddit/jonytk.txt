i'm unemployed in spain, should i sell all the btc to pay for rent?

yes, this is old news and gox wallet was badly fixed with a rule to send oldest coins first, and it's the source of the problem that they were sending invalid tx that were then reisued with the tx maleability bug in order to stole the coins at gox. Miners were sending coins, then withdraw and then changing the encoding to cause the tx ide to change, causing the tx to appear to have failed on gox side and getting coins for free.

is that a kilo-bit ? :)

Decentraliced mining is necesary, 
now, the reason the people used ghash.io so much is that it offers alt-coin mining, if you could later continue developing p2pool to allow that , it will be awesome! 
maybe ask for a bountie for that too on bitcointalk!

Yes, and if you can't find your flight use destinia.com they have flights all over the world with bitcoin.

pools get nmc for free when mining btc, it's merged mining, it was implemented to increase mining rate without splitting the network. (this is the opposite of what happen with ltc vs altcoins) 
Some people are hurt with nmc  because they bought nmc when it was 0.1 or higher... 
@_date: 2014-12-08 12:23:24
localbitcoins.com anyone can be a exchanger with bitcoin. Now, the problem is that, most likely, no-one want to exchange large amounts for a inflationary currency. circle.com may work too if you have a internet-enabled credit card.
@_date: 2014-02-10 14:04:34
they get the max value of course. 
@_date: 2014-02-02 21:30:54
Yeah, they should not charge per episode, unless it's kind of a kickstarter, for example , they could charge to bring back SGU by only releasing on the internet the episode after it meets certain amount of donations. Those donations could be in btc!

Get real they are losing money if every unlimited user just downloads 24/7, there should be a pay per time model option, the more you buy at once the more discount you get.

Yes! help launder the money from the hackers that double spended at gox !!! yay!!!  /ironic mode off/
@_date: 2014-02-16 22:35:47
and also there are people that have options to buy btc at say 150 or 200$ so they don't mind selling, or make money if btc crosses certain ranges.
@_date: 2014-03-23 13:26:27
Canada, of course, near the bitcoin atms...
@_date: 2014-02-28 20:41:50
they could have tried to buy all the coins many times and failed, in fact it's known they have an unlimited account. but since people can put their btc sell at over 9000 $ (unlike in btc-e) they never succeeded.
@_date: 2014-02-26 18:28:08
it is impossible that they were stolen 740000 btc, 
someone would have notice, unless criminal negligence in accounting, fractionary banking and lack of real cold wallets.
Most likely all the loses happened in the last month or so and amounts to somewhere half of the sucessfull btc withdrawalls in the last month. If the are missing fiat, it's because of the seize of their US operations.
@_date: 2014-12-08 12:26:56
so, i guess half of the country is busy trying to arbitrage this instead of producing any product...

i can confirm sepa deposit made the 17.2 never made it to my gox account.
@_date: 2014-02-09 03:04:55
i think nothing, but the point is, that as soon as someone reports 1 counterfeit, all the previous ones are invalid, and this can be checked by any user of the coin, before accepting it. the authentic issuer will have a private key that is used to "sign" the nmc data of each physical coin and its stored in the nmc blockchain. it also can update this to flag the coin. The counterfeiter will need to buy more btc from the issuer every time a counterfeit is discovered and he could be even blacklisted, as he was the buyer of the fake coin.

nimg.com? seems legit...

or maybe we're crazy.

omg, i just sent my btc to gox last week. 
@_date: 2014-12-25 14:59:53
Convoluted? Typing your cc details versus scanning a QR code and press send?
i am sure it cost less than the chargebacks and card denied they get!
If you check they "buy" page they had to limit card payments to 20euros due to rampant fraud! 
@_date: 2014-02-20 11:54:01
sended euros last weekend, still waiting ...
@_date: 2014-02-25 15:16:27
That's the total amount of funds transferred, if that's their hot wallet,
you can guess the max amount lost if you add up all the withdrawalls made there since the 1 of february. assuming the hack started around that day. i say 80000... 
@_date: 2014-02-24 20:46:47
Spain ? Czech republic...
@_date: 2014-02-26 15:44:03
To mtgox staff, we need to know if our Euro deposits are safe and will be credited on the future or if we should chargeback them. 
@_date: 2014-02-02 22:05:44
i'm sure they can save on chargebacks
@_date: 2014-02-02 22:16:27
maybe a virtual currency. if only there were such a thing...

into, but i don't buy this. makes no sense whatsoever.
@_date: 2014-12-08 12:43:17
TL,DR: don't mine, buy btc now.
@_date: 2014-02-16 19:41:44
two options: 
1- you are talking to a scam (fake) btc-e support.
2- they want you put BTC on deposit with them as insurance as chargeback of your $ deposit...
tip : you must know it's impossible to deposit by credit card. why you even try?
@_date: 2014-03-15 06:29:00
with btc any news is good news!
@_date: 2014-02-28 21:01:25
i woun't send there even dogecoins...
@_date: 2014-02-24 20:43:05
i recomend you czech republic too. 
@_date: 2014-03-08 08:39:11
it is also possible that Satoshi was just one of the programmers of the code and he never mined most of the BTC, because CIA/NSA has them. And he is under a non disclosure agreement.

price controls and black market exchanges are the canary in the coal mine. Huge dysfunctions on the free market pricing. They announce imminent devaluation.
@_date: 2015-05-07 18:41:20
maybe some people will use Xapo for that and save in TX fees? Let the people decide, but it must be able to accomodate a lot of tx in the next bubble.
