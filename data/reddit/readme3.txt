And... anyone could have posted?
@_date: 2014-01-29 01:14:06
Yes but the old address is still tied to the acct. Its still usable. This is confusing
@_date: 2014-01-12 02:19:07
Us govt will regulate. An income from any profits is capital gains. Its probably best to pay it now. I would pay around 25 percent. Government even wants tax from "illegal income"- it's written right there in the code.
@_date: 2014-01-28 01:27:11
Where do you trade? Which exchange
@_date: 2014-02-07 02:42:07
It is not outlawed right now... the regulations will be in place soon. Very surprised at how ignorant your dinner companions were. They should know of all people to go by law. And there is no law that is rejecting it in this country. Sir- you will be the one with the last laugh. Even my retired ( old ) accountant accepts it and understands. 
@_date: 2014-01-08 02:03:13
I thought I saw address for dollar deposit in one of my accounts but I guess yu can't...
@_date: 2014-01-24 05:45:26
Excellent summary.  Ditto.
@_date: 2014-01-01 00:22:55
I don't quite understand when you guys say bitcoins "destroyed  " but all in all it was an excellent observation and I am highly appreciative. This gives me hope. Thanks

It's about TIMEeeee. I knew the Koreans will take off. And yes they will use it more than any other nation. They are very internet savvy and one of the most wired culture. They would be eager to dive into this new form of wealth. 
@_date: 2014-02-09 02:04:17
What do you mean... verify what
@_date: 2014-01-28 14:22:53
We are not 1942 Germany....ok? The laws do not apply to the selective.  Money laundering is illegal.  There are plenty of criminals who want to launder their money. Shem partook in this period. He didnt have to. This country's system might not be perfect but it tries to bring order, and protect its citizens. Helping money laundering does not help anyone. 
@_date: 2014-01-28 17:24:10
Oh so you allow and condone money laundering. Any decent people would earn money in an honest way and save and invest in an honest way. Anyone that launders money obviously earned it in a shady manner and is trying to keep it in a shady manner.  I am long on bitcoin but Shem whats his name laundered money and go to jail for it. That's all.
@_date: 2014-01-01 03:05:53
Sorry but what is fiat?
@_date: 2014-01-26 13:56:31
But Bitstamp is 810 this morning...  what a difference
@_date: 2014-02-01 02:05:09
Well their earnings report came in... they missed the mark.  It could be that they are trying to increase the cash flow and pay employees bitcoins instead.
@_date: 2014-01-14 23:57:55
Funny funny
@_date: 2014-01-06 01:25:12
There is a good chance that it might not go down that low again...
@_date: 2014-01-31 23:17:38
Once you get the money in and buy bitcoin...its easier from there... to send, or get bitcoins
@_date: 2014-01-24 05:52:02
@_date: 2014-01-19 23:05:22
May I ask what sort of information you were able to see?
@_date: 2014-03-08 04:09:33
Well I thought he was but we heard from the real Satoshi that he wasn't Dorian.  From the same acct as the real Satoshi that communicated 4 years ago.  So I guess not. Why would Dorian deny now with all that money.
@_date: 2014-02-07 03:04:42
Hey people, No Sweat. Rules can always be changed.  China and Russia will realize, " if we can't beat 'em, we will join 'em! "
@_date: 2014-02-26 02:01:14
I did not create this bitcoin but if I did, I would be in on it right now.  Aaand I am not a computer techie.
@_date: 2014-01-17 02:08:45
It took 4 yrs for it to make it to 1k price. What.. from zero. But imagine holding onto all those bitcoins now.  Time requires patience. Its like the stock market - no stock ever stays horizontal. Keep eyeing the bitcoin chart. You will get used to it.  
@_date: 2014-02-07 23:55:04

They are horrible, horrible, horrible! I hope they are reading this and get themselves straightened out! 
@_date: 2014-01-31 17:34:52
Aka.... Darkwing? ....he will collect his negative votes very quickly...
@_date: 2014-01-26 01:10:53
That's my worry...I don't know if they would want to be part of someone else's coin. You know, second fiddle. I am sure they would want their own name stamped on it.  
@_date: 2014-02-17 01:03:23

Sorry but what is that?
@_date: 2014-02-14 04:06:09
Sending money internationally and buying and selling globally is going to be a lot easier. The bitcoin market is not just here in US. Think about how big the market is going to be. Its going to tie everything globally. Key word here - Global. 
@_date: 2014-01-30 02:11:39
Darkwing? Or same club
@_date: 2014-01-19 22:53:22
One of the funniest comments...
@_date: 2014-02-02 02:10:38
Could I ask why because it all points to same wallet....I don't think that makes a difference.
@_date: 2014-01-10 01:20:26
Was there an article? What did it say?
@_date: 2014-01-21 02:23:02
Before the fed gets to tax? They can back track and make people pay. I really don't think you can get away with not paying taxes.
@_date: 2014-01-27 00:48:42
IS THIS DARK WING? I KNOW YOU were Kicked out by the mods.... not long ago.
@_date: 2014-02-06 02:51:19
Well, I mean, they could make more money doing their own cryptocurrency than from advertisement... possible. Its all about money.
@_date: 2014-01-21 02:26:04
There is a free website that can upload your pic and resize it to your spec. I just can't remember the name. You can google.
@_date: 2014-01-22 22:38:25
Yes but this was my question. The merchants would have to either hire a developer to integrate the bitcoin transactions or use a company- a third party to upkeep it, in which there will be a fee.  Lets be honest, to maintain the bitcoins have been a lot of work and merchants don't have time. The security of it all takes extra effort. There is going to have to be a better way for merchants.
@_date: 2014-01-28 02:06:35
You are very funny. You could at least create a different name. Darkwings- 08,   D-W-08, and now    Nigwings-08.

I vote for waiting... and it should not have been money for living.
@_date: 2014-01-15 03:40:29
Well is this going to compete with bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-01-12 14:29:33
Only if you hold it for more than a year or you are taxed
@_date: 2014-02-09 20:58:25
What do you mean you don't know what to do? Invest some in stock, give some to charity, enjoy raising your children, go on vacation... Count your blessings and enjoy life and help those in need along the way.  
@_date: 2014-01-05 03:40:59
Could you kindly tell me how you did this plz?
@_date: 2014-01-28 15:54:35
Well then you go and make a better govt.  No system is perfect. Everyone makes mistakes. That's why its best not to get in trouble. Just  do what your supposed to do to earn money educate yourself and live a decent life. Shem did not have to launder money. He knew exactly what he was doing. 
@_date: 2014-01-19 19:54:40
Yeah... uhhh based on what.
@_date: 2014-01-14 02:33:49
Well with millions and even billions of botcoin usage, couldn't someone end up guessing one private key? 
@_date: 2014-01-15 03:50:39
No, its interesting that bitcoin is being accepted in the most remote parts of the earth. We need every part of the world use it.
@_date: 2014-01-01 16:48:42
You should have started from .00001. Isnt that where it started from?

Hang in there. Its only temporary. Everything goes up and down. But the momentum is there. I am shocked its not at 500.  I actually think this is pretty good. 
@_date: 2014-02-19 01:19:50
Actually I like that specific post... helps me stay positive..
@_date: 2014-02-10 04:03:53
I don't know about 1bitcoin equaling a million... I mean it will be up there but 1million?
@_date: 2014-02-19 01:46:22
@_date: 2014-01-25 02:33:32
Well even with bitcoin we still need bank... how else we will draw cash
@_date: 2014-01-20 17:32:12
So then and now we should use it for medium to big items and not small?
@_date: 2014-02-19 23:14:30
If bitcoins are dead right now they sure do know how to resurrect themselves many times as was done in the past.  For anyone that has doubt about its future just look at the past and see how much its value went up.  Even now sustains itself at $600 not $0.
@_date: 2014-01-15 23:03:43
Why 2025? Some people quote 2140.. we will all be dead by then.  The last coin will be mined 2140.  I will be watching from heaven.
@_date: 2014-01-12 14:39:38
Ohhhh that's very funny!!!
@_date: 2014-01-29 20:32:33
Provide your proof. 
@_date: 2014-01-29 20:39:39
Shem has done nothing but give bitcoins a bad name.  He did nothing to help this cause
@_date: 2014-02-03 01:31:19
I think the reporting is for bank.... the regulations have not come thru for exchanges yet.  Its when you put the money in bank, the bank will report it. Aand you do have to pay tax.
@_date: 2014-01-09 04:04:57
Oh yeah... completely understood! For sure.

Why do people keep on saying bitcoin will kill money. It never will.  Did credit card kill money?  Money is foundation of all these transactions. There will always be money.
@_date: 2014-01-14 23:27:25
What country.. US?
@_date: 2014-02-05 21:46:28
Well, no, I disagree. When you pay somebody bitcoins, it should be said, "coco their bobo" and when you get payment you should say, "hobo my coho."
@_date: 2014-01-19 11:27:50
I thought once it is generated... it's not used again. 
@_date: 2014-01-29 20:32:58
I don't think so

Is this how you do with paper wallet also?
@_date: 2014-02-10 04:00:56
How could he spend his coins just once? Can you explain plz? He can distribute to many different addresses and spend that way...
@_date: 2014-02-01 02:21:04
Look, by the time you did your research and figured out bitcoin is worthwhile, we would all have made our money. Then you would become bitter and become another Dark-Wing. 
@_date: 2014-01-27 03:04:11
Why do they do that - I mean they don't have to. I am sorry but I think they are just wasting the addresses even tho there are a lot. I assume there is only one private address to it...
@_date: 2014-01-08 01:53:11
Hey you can't trasfer $ out of Gox to another exchange?
@_date: 2017-07-05 00:12:58
No, i thought i read enuff on it. Even for .15 i thought i would like to mine to accumulate btc... ethereum mining- i dont know how to put together a rig. I have a spare pc i can use and add gpus? Hiw do i setup the software please?
@_date: 2017-07-05 00:02:31
Also apart from joining pools, do i need to use a mining software? Thanks
@_date: 2017-07-21 16:27:30
All I know is there will be BTC and BTUs
@_date: 2017-07-05 01:01:04
Yes but the price goes up. The whole point is the price goes up also and therefore i dont think profitability goes down. Each btc is going to be worth a lot later
@_date: 2017-07-05 00:45:59
Why go down in 9 months?
@_date: 2017-07-05 01:07:40
No im not trolling... i think i make sense- the price will go up as difficulties go up and there will be more powerful machines. Anyway thanks for all of yur help
@_date: 2017-07-05 00:01:53
No in btc... i heard everything from .28 to .15. Im not interested in money as much as how much bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-07-05 00:44:10
How do you know its .09/ month? If i have several...
@_date: 2017-07-05 04:09:30
Ok thanks. Thats a good number
@_date: 2017-07-03 22:30:55
Thank you for that reply... the whole wallet address? Well what if you dont use it?  And where do i go to check on miners' status? Thanks
@_date: 2017-07-05 01:02:53
And antminer will come up with more powerful cpu. I think the profitability will stay the same
@_date: 2017-07-21 16:42:30
The point,I assume, is Not the Price but there will be two different kinds of Bitcoins- BTC and BTU's.  We're talking bananas and apples. This isn't good for Bitcoins world is it?
@_date: 2017-07-05 00:09:17
How do you know have you mined yourself?
@_date: 2013-12-25 23:22:44
Wow yu get neat presents!
@_date: 2017-07-21 16:51:57
I thought there were only 2... omg how many more are there... all right I'll have to read on this!

@_date: 2013-12-29 03:20:13
Yes that will never happen. And I belive there will always be banks...

Wait till bitcoin goes down. Then buy a few...
@_date: 2013-12-25 22:29:50
Does this really work or scam
@_date: 2013-12-30 05:47:39
What I meant was there are plenty of students, workers from overseas who want to send money over to their poor families and I have seen many of them. I think you are reacting way over. Also you think americans are arrogant? Are you kidding me? Every culture has its own display of arrogance. I have seen enough of them leak also.
@_date: 2013-12-26 14:59:17
Maybe.... but things will change..everything changes... better technology. But for inter country money transfer even for businesses..this is good.
@_date: 2013-12-14 01:07:56
Wow.... how futuristic and makes a perfect sense. But who is going to keep or take care of all these trillions of ledgers made by billions of people. 
@_date: 2013-12-26 04:56:07
Look, right now bitcoin seems excellent for sending money either domestically or esp. Overseas.. or doing business inter-country.. but for an average Jane and Joe to buy a small item...maybe too much trouble. There needs to be better technology. I think right now the bitcoin value is based on its ability to exchange money across all currency and people believing this.
@_date: 2013-12-26 15:19:29
If yu search bitcoin in reddit that's first it comes up..." bitcoin still feeds people" I am sure that's the one... if not oh well...
@_date: 2013-12-25 23:23:33
I mean give

Yup . I know I will!!
@_date: 2013-12-28 02:48:45
You must have made a very good profit. If you pay , IRS will put a halo on you and not bother you too much in the future. I think they will eventually go after everyone. Trading bitcoin is just like stock.  You are doing good by paying up first. What did your accountant say?
@_date: 2013-12-26 23:21:57
That's mean..it does mean something..
@_date: 2013-12-30 14:15:49
I don't totally disagree with you and some of them get scholarships but that doesn't mean their family is rich. But ok I do get your point even though I am not entirely in agreement with you. And thank you for your response
@_date: 2013-12-31 21:53:50
You can set up a bank acct just for bitcoins then. You can have another acct for your regular banking...
@_date: 2013-12-29 01:36:16
Yes, what's your point?
@_date: 2013-12-27 00:22:28
Wait till korea gets in on this...they're one of the most wired countries..
@_date: 2013-12-26 15:12:21
Wow I am glad it worked for you. Spread the word
@_date: 2013-12-26 04:58:53
Like my comment above its easiest to send money domestically or esp overseas but not for small purchases. The value is based on its ability to send money without going thru banks
@_date: 2013-12-29 19:42:30

I am betting on $40k...winklevoss expected a trillion dollar market cap... with 21million bitcoins in circulation...so that would be $40k - $49k...I hope

Thanks for the article. It helped...
@_date: 2013-12-30 22:44:52
All depending on what the govt will say or start to regulate. I am patiently waiting for news. Remember Bernanke the fed treasury chairman said its usable. He did not knock it at all. We need regulations. Then we are set. More vendors will come on. We have to go thru some growing pains.
@_date: 2013-12-30 23:40:16
I don't think will be much different. They look at it as a head of the whole financial system. If bitcoin usage was questionable he would have said it. I still think we have a growing pain to experience. But it will work out
