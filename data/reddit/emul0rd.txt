They do, don’t worry. I reckon the delay in getting your coins back is due to the clustered network atm.

I am not sure I get it. Does your bank order BTC transactions for you ?
Anyway, once a BTC transaction is issued, you cannot go back unfortunately, since it is already handled to miners for confirmation.
Same goes whether you just issued some fiat wire transfer or paid with your credit card for BTC. As you are the one initiating the operation, most banks usually don’t accept to cancel legitimate purchases.

Now I get it perfectly, thank you.
Well as far as I know, my bank will just laugh at me if I try to cancel some SEPA wire transfer I initiated. But then, contrary to OP’s case, the amount sent is instantly withdrawn from my account balance.

I guess you mean money supply.
Would be curious to know that too.

Just try to withdraw and you will see. There’s not much more I can say about it.

Well, this is not too exaggerated of a threshold with the ever increasing transaction fees. But 500k sats used to raise a scam alert back in the days, so I don’t know.

Oh I see, alright then !
Googled it, and well I am not familiar with this system, living in a country that doesn’t use ACH, at least I don’t think so.
