I've always wondered if you say "it's personal", or "I'd rather not say", do you get a red flag next to your name?
@_date: 2014-06-28 08:22:03
Where is that?

I would also like to chime in to suggest not to use a GPL based license as they are incompatible with the App Store.
From what I understand, Apache 2 and MIT X11 are compatible.

Would the incentive for smaller block sizes still be there because mining would be slightly faster? i.e. less data to hash.

These people appear to be bullish.

Test the private key every few months, or once a year, to keep the password fresh in your brain.
If you're still worried about forgetting the password, give parts of the password to people you trust.

Even though the product seems legit, there are many new users created just to comment on this post, and presumably to upvote the post itself. Not cool.

Ah I see. I have mistakenly assumed that block hashing was still done normally with the full set of transactions, but when transmitting a solved block, they are thrown in the IBLT only for faster network propagation.
@_date: 2014-03-22 09:24:11
That is correct. For every transaction (in and out) you receive the raw hex of a new transaction (including nLockTime) signed by them via email.

Paper wallets?
@_date: 2015-01-06 23:56:56
Thanks for the explanation.
Right now looking at some [stats on bitnodes.io]( there are currently 20% of nodes that are still running 0.8.*, and hasn't changed much in 90 days. Granted these are not necessarily indicative of miner nodes, but one might assume the numbers would be similar.
On the other hand, 0.9.3 over the last 90 days has gone from around 20% to 50% which is a fairly fast turn around.
It seems to me this will need to be scheduled quite far ahead, e.g. a year after the release?
@_date: 2015-01-28 01:46:51
Is there a reverse tip service?
@_date: 2015-01-07 03:14:20


I had a similar thought too--the idea that an old fork could continue living on just because people have forgotten about a bitcoind that is still running.

Also keep in mind you'll need to make sure you're routing your ports correctly.

Similar happened to me. It took about a week. I sent them a support question about how long it would take. They didn't reply but it was approved the next day.
