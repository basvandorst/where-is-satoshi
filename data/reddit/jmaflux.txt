Fiat currencies today are centralised, geographically limited, arbitrary and costly monetary systems which value depend on states.

Yep I’m starting to work on these kind of projects as a lawyer in Paris, France. Real estate prices are through the roof and you need debt to purchase anything. But with bitcoin you can sell at a lower price because the currency does x20 on average per year so you don’t have the urge to spend the cash by buying another bigger house with debt. Additionally, arranging a transaction like this is potentially easier than buying a house with a bank involved. Problem however: the banks do not process any important amount of money through any thing (wire whatever) because money now is systematically in the banks’ accounts and only vie debt schemes with other private banks and central banks, never truly in the people’s one (you buy the house with the bank that credits your account for that but transferring this sum to another bank will rarely happen for big amounts). 
So you need to take into consideration the following when you arrange transactions like this: 1. You have to index the price on some period of time because bitcoin is volatile 
2. You have to draft contracts that link the transfer of bitcoin to the transfer of ownership of the piece of real estate and also put in place an escrow for the time of the real estate transfer
3. You have to plan how the bitcoin received in exchange of the house will be used because crypto platforms and banks do not process anything bigger than 50k$ on one shot to my knowledge
Do you know of any bank or exchange (crypto or non crypto) that can wire transfer millions of dollars for example? 
Happy to help you with anything.

Bitcoin is extreme low time preference.
