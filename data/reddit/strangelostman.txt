On the other side of things, I sent significantly more money via wire transfer to GDAX. Took about 8 hours to get my funds after clearing. This was yesterday.

Yup, sent at 8am, confirmed at 12

No one is panic selling at 16k-&gt;13k lmao. All panic sellers have jumped ship a while ago.

A very basic definition of a Nash equilibrium is the solution to the game. I'm not sure how government's regulation on bitcoin is solved. I mean you have the two world super powers going in completely different directions with crypto regulation.

Only decentralized slices will exist by then.

Thanks for the recommendation, but I'd rather not have to add an extra layer for her to get to her bitcoin. A dedicated wallet website that is accessible both in USA and China would be ideal. I also don't wanna go down the route of smartphone or hardware wallets.

I'm confused, what is the basis for the Nash equilibrium? in the link the solution is that no money will be given since the bomber is assumed to be rational and acting for profit. are u saying US will not enforce regulations because of fomo? I mean take a look at the most recent net neutrality repeal proposal

Telling your wife can possibly result in one of the costliest mistakes in your life. Will not telling your wife yield the same consequences?

Where are you seeing this accumulation? Certainly not in the price or in the long positions.

Where can we see the SEC/CFTC hearing live? Adding in search words for other people (broadcast, stream, streaming, link, watch, view).

You guys need to stop looking at Bitcoin's price and start reading this paper. It will make you feel 9000% better.
