Can you elaborate on "liquid enough for the 99%ers"?
@_date: 2014-11-05 03:15:11
Thankyou?  This is totally new to me, I need to do some more research......At the risk of sounding thankless and paranoid, why did you send me bits?  To be honest, I am scared to put anything into my account because I don't know how to be secure about it yet. 
*edit...now I feel rude because you were being nice and tipping me, and I now understand changetip.  Thanks!

Thanks!  Here's 50 bits @_date: 2014-11-05 03:10:35
Thankyou?  I don't want to sound thankless or paranoid, but why? Two people have sent me tips now, I don't know anything about this....
*edit   Now I feel like I was being an ass, thanks for the tip!  I understand this now!
