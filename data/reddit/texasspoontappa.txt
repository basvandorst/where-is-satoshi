As I understand it, registration is relatively inexpensive too.

Ok! Ok! I must have, I must have put a decimal point in the wrong place or something. Shit. I always do that. I always mess up some mundane detail.

Can confirm. Pants lost.

Try telling that to wikileaks.

I knew they were filling utah's data center with *something*. But did I know they had eyes on every single bit of information the whole world over? No. And don't pretend that you knew they broke down ssl and symmetric encryption. Or that they have such close ties with big corporations like google. But I guess everybody's hindsight is 20/20, especially on reddit.
In fact, since you obviously knew all about this NSA stuff before snowden; you should enlighten us with some of the future leaks that the guardian is yet to post. It shouldn't be hard because it's such common knowledge anyway.

It's not a stretch for me. My behavior on and off the internet has changed substantially because of the NSA revelations. Bitcoin is now my savings account in lieu of a traditional bank.

I guess it was the straw that broke the camel's back. In the case of Edward Snowden, it was like the metric ton of straw forcing me to make changes in my life. Bitcoin was one of those changes; along with learning encryption methods, tor-network, bitmessaging... I still have a long way to go but I learning.

You should record it.  ...assuming that's not illegal too.

Simple, just attach a .cad file. With 3D printing getting bigger, I could see local 3D print shops as an alternative to hand delivered packages.

I don't have enough money to diversify. It was only a few months ago that I've stopped living paycheck to paycheck. So basically, I pay my bills and what little I have left, I've been putting in bitcoin.

If that's the case, then they don't have a very good understanding of the community they deal with.
