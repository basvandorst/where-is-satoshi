Good point actually. Will post there. Move along, nothing to see here :)

But they're all dollars. Baht is not Bitcoin.

Maybe in your little bubble that is the US but in other parts of the world WP is doing quite well.* apologies if you're not in the US.

Erh? "Google 2FA" is just an implementation of TOTP. If data is leaked about the 2FA codes it's your implementation that's doing something wrong. Google isn't involved in the 2FA process at all. They just built an app to display the time-based 2FA codes. You can find lots of other apps that do the same, using the same algorithm, or you could make your own (the algorithm in question is actually quite simple).

It doesn't run on my Windows Phone. In fact, no wallets do these days. 
@_date: 2014-04-09 14:19:08
They use the $ sign for historical reasons. IMO that's not an argument for using the Baht-symbol for Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-04-09 13:41:00
Except ฿ is already the official symbol for another currency, namely Thai Baht.

As a person who spent all my childhood years in Gabs (1980-1994) I just wanted to wish you all the best of luck. Oh and I really do miss Botswana! The Danish climate never really grew on me and probably never really will :-)
@_date: 2014-01-09 07:04:14
Well we're about the same age then :) I was born in 1979 ;)
@_date: 2014-09-30 11:46:28
I tried it this morning also from Denmark. Wow that is a smooth experience; less than 5 minutes from signup to Bitcoin transfer to my wallet. Awesome!
@_date: 2014-12-12 08:01:38
That's exactly how I explain the lack of downloads of my "Bitcoin Average" app when colleagues jokingly ask why I'm not a millionaire yet. I get like 3-5 downloads a day. Like you said, the intersection of WP users _and_ bitcoin users is not a lot of people :-D
@_date: 2016-12-29 18:34:36
Problem with passphrase.io is it's not open source so no way to verify that they're even encrypting or storing stuff securely. 
@_date: 2016-12-29 19:21:58


Nope, no download links here (apart from the phone apps, that is)... I do see the text "open source" but can't find a download link. I can, however, view the source of the javascript used, so I guess that's a place to start (and the js files do say they are licensed under MIT so....)

This is AWESOME news!

Does the card only contain the public key? If so, what do you do with the private key?
Also, if it contains the private key too, isn't there a rather large risk that the printers could store a copy of the private key and empty the address at some point?
@_date: 2017-06-12 20:05:25
I wanted to buy in at the dip as well but no. Coinbase is, of course, down this time as well. What other good, stable and trustworthy options are there that support EU credit card deposits? 
@_date: 2013-11-15 10:54:42
Whew, just made it! 34 here :-)
@_date: 2013-11-08 14:16:38
I've just seen the "It's for free" thing referenced so many times all over the net and when talking to people. It just made me wonder since most of us know perfectly well that there are fees. 
@_date: 2013-05-27 06:51:57
Sounds awesome! I'd love to help out with the beta test :)

How do I delete the private keys from the addresses I have in my blockchain.info wallet? I've been looking for exactly this.
@_date: 2013-05-27 07:35:02
Just playing around with it now, transferred a small amount to the address generated. I like that the "Available to Send" amount already has the transaction fee deducted - nice usability touch. 


Just tried this too - it might be worth noting that people need to copy the whole secret part of the URL, including the # sign, for it to work. But yes, simply importing the string as a brain wallet on blockchain.info worked beautifully :-)
*edit - words.
@_date: 2013-12-24 11:20:40
I always have been. So no more now than before I guess. 
@_date: 2013-11-03 10:50:27
How is that secure?
@_date: 2013-12-24 12:28:43
I can't put a wallet app under the tree.
@_date: 2013-11-23 23:05:16
It is now! :-)
@_date: 2013-04-29 12:13:31
Not visible to me either :( I tried searching for bitcoin and btc but nothing turns up. 
@_date: 2013-11-03 09:32:54
Write the password on the paper wallet? 
@_date: 2013-11-03 11:06:59
I get that - what confused me was why you would write the password on the same piece of paper. Stolen paper = instant access to coins. Then I might as well just use an unencrypted wallet paper wallet, right?
@_date: 2013-12-26 12:48:20
[Thai Baht]( We should really stop using this symbol for Bitcoin since it's already the official symbol for another currency. The "official" Bitcoin logo has two vertical bars and doesn't (yet) have a Unicode character.
@_date: 2013-09-17 09:47:03
This looks like a "concept" website. Scanning the QR Code just takes you to  and all the APP links just take you to the official Danske Bank MobilePay app (which doesn't do anything Bitcoin-related. 
So nope, this isn't a thing unfortunately. 
@_date: 2013-12-10 06:48:22
I did an app that does this on Windows Phone. It displays the current price from bitcoinaverage.com on a live tile and on your lock screen so you don't need to unlock your phone or open an app to see where the price is. Just search for Bitcoin Average in the store :)
@_date: 2013-12-23 22:24:01
I wouldn't do this if they weren't curious. And how is this a waste of time? It's a gimmick and a little extra something on top of what they're already getting. 
@_date: 2013-10-16 07:11:15
Isn't that really up to ourselves? I mean - if we want a meetup we could arrange one, couldn't we? It doesn't have to involve anything else than getting together for a beer or two and talking about BTC.
@_date: 2013-11-15 08:59:43
In the upcoming version that I submitted yesterda you can switch between USD and EUR. The changes are reflected on the Live Tile. Also a bug has been fixed where the "Ignore Mt. Gox" possibility wasn't being pulled into the Tile - instead it was always showing the price without Mt. Gox data. 
I have plenty more ideas for this app including charts, UI updates, push notifications (for example when the price rises or falls more than a set amount/percentage, or when the price simply hits a certain amount) and so on. Stay tuned :-)
@_date: 2013-06-11 08:35:09
The "Estimated confirmation time" has been lingering anywhere between 4 and 30 minutes the whole time, if that's what you're looking at :)

The Google 2FA solution doesn't rely on Google's servers at all.
Google Authenticator is just a 6-digit number generated based on a hash of a shared secret (which is what the site sends you in a QR code or lets you enter manually into the Authenticator app) and the number of elapsed 30-second intervals since UNIX epoch (1/1/1970 00:00:00Z). Thus whatever you have in your Google cookies etc. is not relevant - your 2FA code never goes through Google's servers. 
@_date: 2013-05-14 13:29:40
I don't know. I was just objecting to 


Which isn't true since you aren't logging in through Google's servers at any point in the MtGox login process. Everything happens between you  and your browser and MtGox's servers. So the breach has happened somewhere along these lines. OPs machine was probably compromised by malware beforehand and the attacker waited patiently for her to log in to MtGox before striking. 
@_date: 2013-05-19 22:10:31
Ok I have the private key - but the address seems to be unused (no transactions according to the blockchain). Am I missing something?
@_date: 2013-08-28 07:47:56
I get "Invalid credentials" when I try to pair the app with my account. 
@_date: 2013-12-24 11:20:00
How so? Right now the balance on them is 0. When I give them their paper wallets, I'll send a few mBTC to each of them from my phone while I explain what's going on. 
@_date: 2013-04-30 13:55:03
I don't see how this is any different from a physical wallet with $, £ or € in it. I wouldn't trust these stickers as my only means of security with one of those so why should I on a paper btc wallet? Don't let the stickers fool you into thinking that you're safe, no matter how they look. 
I have ordered a bunch and think they'll definitely add a nice bit of "Ooh! Shiny!" to paper wallets that I would give out to friends and relatives preloaded with a small amount of BTC.
@_date: 2013-11-08 14:21:47
I've seen it once, but usually it is done within a few hours which I guess would be fine for most people. But still we get the "and it's instantaneous" which is still untrue. 
  
Maybe I'm just being a bit too pedantic here ;)
@_date: 2013-05-24 21:38:20
In that case, cool :-)
@_date: 2013-11-28 08:25:21
Cool, I'll continue to ignore the price on Gox then ;)
@_date: 2013-05-01 11:48:28
Awesome! Thanks!
@_date: 2013-06-11 08:59:30
The addresses aren't mine but a friend's. And yes, he's using blockchain wallet :)
We'll try to see if we can do the double-spend thing later on today. If all else fails, will the transaction simply be reverted, returning the coins to the sender addresses?
