If you save that kind of money once, you can do it again. This time even better.
You're obviously better off than 80% of the population of the planet, and they get by.
Brush it off, Pick yourself up and carry on.
THAT is what you should show your kids.

I'm starting a business that builds robots. We will be a fully insured robot company. If any of our robots malfunction or go on a killing rampage, consumers will be refunded the purchase price of the robot. Minus shipping of course.  
This will be fully insured by an insurance company I'm also starting that will supply the growing demand for insurance for robot companies.
You can get in on the ground floor and become a shareholder for 20% with an investment of $100,000.  This will allow me to go to robot school and become a licensed insurance salesperson.

If I was the one making the decision to get a POS system to take crypto, and I am, I'd want Doge in there and the possibility if addin others because why turn away a sale? Also, doge has a great WTF factor that works in marketing

Have a good idea?
@_date: 2014-03-30 18:57:29
Demoralize? Quite the opposite. Helping a guy out who has been wronged is the moral thing to do. It's the right thing to do.
I don't think he's going to sit on the coins and wait. He needs help now, not in the future.
Getting BTC into circulation, and getting good publicity from BTC for righting a wrong will help.

Damn man. I have enough to 'buy' all of them and that makes me really really upset. 
Really upset. 
Because to 'buy' them would be fucking wrong. And to NOT would be fucking wrong.

Yup. That's exactly the problem. Ideas?
@_date: 2014-03-25 06:13:09
Yeah. THIS is what I'm talking about. How hard is it to implement a payment button-with variables like price and currency type- on a website? I like that there is actual info on the website. Kryptokit is kinda cryptic and honey is completely off topic.

Down for me too.  Clearing the cache doesn't work either. They did warn of a server maintenance at noon today, but you'd think they'd email everyone with an account beforehand instead of randomly tweeting.

There's only one ATM that I know of in Van and it does not scan your palm (definitely doesn't scan your palm because I've used it with gloves on... because CANADA!). Or take your photograph (ok there's no flash - it MIGHT but that's REALLY easy to get around).  All those things ARE built into the cabinet, but they are not active. I've used it numerous times.  There's only an attendant sometimes.  And it's a polite suggestion that you make an appointment for transactions over $3000. I love this thing.

I use a BTC ATM in Vancouver Canada. It's super simple.
Push "Buy", Flash your QR, Stuff $ into slot, Push "Finish".
No personal info required!

I did not expect anger. I have no Idea how I sparked that kind of reaction. [Here's a picture of my cat](
You're right, I don't think it's an 'important' cause. But it's just one more in a billion that we can help while sitting in front of the computer.
Does someone need to be thrown in jail or his hose burned down before someone can help? 
And please explain to me how I offended you guys, because this doesn't make sense to me.

I think each RoboCoin kiosk has rates set by the establishment it resides in. As in, a store will buy a RoboCoin machine and set their own rates on top of the rates RoboCoin has (which are pretty low compared to other ATM's if I recall).
I use the one in Vancouver BC.  It has a pretty high rate of I'm guessing 6-7% I'm usually paying ~$25 extra for .5 BTC.
That's lower than a lot of online BTC purchasing sites though.
If I were you I'd call them and see what rate they are at before making the trek. Then think about using an Exchange instead, as you can get even better rates there.  But they take quite a while to set up an account sometimes... Hope that helps.
