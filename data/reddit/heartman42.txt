The assertion was that fees are dropping because people are using Segwit. If only ~15% of the transactions are using Segwit, that's not correct.

Thanks for the updated data (16% vs 11%).

Here is data that shows otherwise. This is the number of transactions by currency. 
You'll see that ETH transactions are up about 3x in the last month, as are LTC and BCH, where BTC transactions are relatively stagnant.

Which means most people are not using Segwit.
So the data supports my claim. It refutes yours. I think that makes you wrong. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

This is more of an example of a corrupt financial system. There are plenty of socialist countries that have successful economies.
