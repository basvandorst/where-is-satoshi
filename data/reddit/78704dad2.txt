Both sides are silly.  All financials are deep into BCT.
I really want to see crypto kill the big guys and govts off.  I want to crowd source my own insurance, mortgage etc.  Making society more equitable by removing corporations, government, and toll booths extracting billions by platforming an idea that should be solved via universal access and ledgers.

Survivorship bias 101.  Passive income is gained through inflationary assets is my best advice, convert the bitcoin to rental properties and then go back in to crypto if you can.  That is a lifetime annuity with favorable taxation and hedging you can rarely lock down.

It's called index funds... So yes you can buy fractions of BRK.A.  
There are different shares and warrants only the wealthly can obtain and they get paid first and even in case of bankruptcy they still get their funds back often.

All I want to see is sourced products without a company.......My mortgage, insurance, car loans.....That is when I know the horse is out of the barn and is never going back in.  Bring everyone closer to zero when you remove banks and govts.

It's called...."Survivorship Bias".
Edit: it's a symptom of humans linear monkey brain seeing trends and only the positive.  It's a neat evolutionary trick, works on doing impressions, magic, acting confidently for MLM "investments", and is common among PhD's outside of math and physics.
