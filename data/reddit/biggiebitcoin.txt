One other aspect is that a lot of people buy BTC and leave it on exchanges.  So these people own (not control) BTC, and they are only counted as an exchange address.

My support ticket is from May, 2017 (that's sad that I need to include the year).  
I got a couple of automated responses, and than finally a human like response saying that they would fix my issue.  Nothing for week's, and than another automated response, and than nothing.
So now it's 8 months later, I just open up a new ticket with that same issue.

Gemini is a lot more reasonable.  I'm not sure what their exact fees are, but a $25 transaction on Coinbase is over a $1, and Gemini is around 15 cents.

There's a difference between thinking of buying BTC, and actually owning it and having it go away (hacking, or selling).
I do see your point though. You can't dwell on the past, and need to see what you can do today..to help your future self.

Trezor seams like the best option. It seems more dummy proof then paper wallets, as in not having to use "tails" or a computer that's never touched the internet just to print a wallet; and being able to spend it without having to create a new wallet all together.
I still want to try paper wallets, but feel more comfortable with a trezor.

Why are you selling your BTC? You have lots of transactions moving from your address to that same kraken account.

I totally agree. 
I think the big usefulness for this service would be paywalls for content, or to replace advertising revenues to get rid of ads. 
It can still be useful for micro payments in developing nations where the 3 cent bitcoin transaction can get expensive.

**Here are just a few corrections:**
*Bitcoin, somehow, continues to persist despite mounting evidence that it’s not the best use of your money.*
* 1) What is your evidence that it's not the best use of my money?  That would be like me saying that your writing style is poor; and How would anyone know the best use of money..except for me.
*Financial experts have largely cast aside the web-based currency as a legitimate investment, calling it too volatile, too risky, and in some cases, a scam.* 
* 2) Some of that is true.  Cars and Electricity were also though of those ways in the early days.
*The Financial Times also reported in 2015 that bitcoin has all of the attributes of a pyramid scheme.*
* 3) They may have referenced that, but there is no logic to back that up.  You had to dig back 2 years just to find nonfactual and biased reporting?
*The cryptocurrency has long been embroiled in a history of fuck-ups and controversies, including a half-a-billion-dollar heist from the world’s largest bitcoin exchange in 2014.*
* 4) 100% true!  It has been embroiled in those issues but has not had any problems by itself.  Money has been embroiled in many fuck-ups too.  If bitcoin can be embroiled in the same fuck-ups as "real" money..than that means that it works.
*It doesn’t help that the currency’s origin story is murky, too. Bitcoin was supposedly created by an unidentified programmer (or group of programmers) under the name Satoshi Nakamoto. Although several news outlets have tried in the past to identify Nakamoto, the creator still remains unknown.*
* 5) True, except that it does help. If no one or group can be identified, there is no one to go after. The code is also open source, so it really doesn't matter.
*The currency’s price saw a sharp uptick this week due to an increased amount of speculation that the first bitcoin ETF, an investment fund traded on stock exchanges, is closing in on approval from US regulators, according to recent CNBC and Bloomberg reports.*
* 6) It's all a fugazi, it's a wazi it's a woozy.  Farrie dust.
*But as the New York Times reported last year, a small group of Chinese companies have effectively gained control of bitcoin, making it vulnerable to market manipulation. Add that on top of the fact that bitcoin exchanges are prone to collapsing (as they have in the past) and you have a digital currency that is, according to the Financial Times, essentially worthless. At least it’s good for entertainment.*
* 7) Yes, you can buy a lot of entertainment with Bitcoin!
@_date: 2015-01-16 02:33:54
I was excited when I heard that TechCrunch was starting a podcast!
They have some enthusiasm and a entertaining personality's to listen to. That where the good news stops though.
*The audio was at different volumes, and sound quality wasn't that good.  (This was the least of my concerns)
*They said that the difficulty cannot go down if miners stop mining.  This couldn't be more wrong, as the network is self adjusting (up or down) every 2016 blocks, to average 10 minute block times.
*They encouraged gambling with bitcoin.  I don't have any problems with gambling with bitcoin, but they should have more respect for it by just saying that gambling is one of the uses, and is actually verifiable so the house can't cheat.
*They also said to transfer money from coinbase to gambling sites directly, then withdraw back to coinbase.  This is against coinbase's policy, and many people have been kicked off coinbase for this very reason.
Episode 2 should just be a public apology; and then try again with some new guys that actually know what they are talking about.

If 2 million people each tried to own 10 BTC, there wouldn't be enough supply, and the price would skyrocket. I've seen people trading 100's of BTC at a time, so the amount of people that own 10+ BTC must be less the 1 million.
I would think that more then 1 million people would like to be part of this group. (and countless others that would like to hold a small amount)
Honestly it was the greed at first...after hearing about the 2 million bitcoin pizza in 2013. Now it is about the freedom, and all the surrounding technologies that are evolving.
@_date: 2015-01-14 03:58:20
The shorts have to buy back, and that could cause a big spike when the buy back.
If the price goes up fast, the shorts will be forced to cover, (they could loose everything) also making the price spike.
I just don't know how to analyse the graphs/numbers on sites like Bitfinex. Just curious if there was some info there to determine if $220 is finally the bottom.

Nice talk.  I love how he always comes up with a new take and different historical comparisons to other technologies.
After sending transactions for free, or just a couple of cents, it's still a shock when he said that you can send any transaction for about a $1.
I remember the cost of international phone call over land line, and roaming charges from cell phones.  Getting charged per text and per minute; to having unlimited text and minutes for an affordable price.
I feel that bitcoin will also have some "fix" in the near future that will allow quicker transactions and cheaper fees.  A lot of this will have to be built merely on top of the network.

True, you could say that about any investment that went up in value.  
But it's truly different when you actually own the the asset and then sell it; as opposed to just thinking about buying it.
Example: I thought about buying a hundred shares of Amazon at $5, but never did. (Oh Well).
I bought 10 Bitcoin at $160, and sold them for $100 (Oh Shit).
Yeah there's a difference, but you can't change the past; and only make better decisions in the future.

I get the catchy preview, but it's not accurate.  Of course people do "shady" things with it, but any form of useful money will allow that.

I remember when bitmain was saying they wanted to spread there chips around to "everyone" to stop centralization. Kinda their fault, but also it's though for people to make a commitment to buying their chips for mining at a loss...especially with the huge hash rate spikes.
I remember when I had 9 USB miners, and wanted to keep my 3GH of power to spread out the mining pools.  lol at that.. because I was actually making almost $10 a day.
WOW, just looked at bitmain's website.  4.73 TH/s for less than $800

The only question that I didn't like was about regulation. 
Yes, there will be local regulation at the exchange level.
(I would have added...)
No, there can't be regulation on Bitcoin or the Blockchain directly. The whole world would have to agree on the same regulation.  I know that USA has 50 different methods of regulating Bitcoin, and the rest of the planet has other thoughts...so regulation can only be held at the local level.

I'm almost positive it's a scam... If you get in early (and it still might be) you could make some money. The way it builds, is that someone put's in a $100, and cashes out, than they put in $1010.  
The only way to do it would be to put in big first, cash out; and than put in smaller amounts until it busts.  That way you can't loose any money.
I'm staying away, fearful that it might be too late.
