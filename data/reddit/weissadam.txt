As everyone else has said, trying to infer value by automated analysis of changes to source file text doesn't make a whole lot of sense.
With respect to perverse incentives, schemes like this really add new and complicated political dynamics resulting in additional load in the review and change approval process.
For new features, I think the Lighthouse model is excellent.  A public bounty is posted for a specific feature, and if someone implements it, they get a reward.
Unfortunately, much of core Bitcoin development is a mix of sustaining engineering, bugfixes and refactoring.  With these sorts of changes, it can be difficult for trained human eyes with project and domain knowledge to assess progress, contribution weight and value, let alone having a computer try to do it.

I really liked their exchange.  It had a good quality UI, their trading API was totally sensible and everything about them exuded quality.
Unfortunately it's a tough market.  Getting the technology right, the regulatory compliance right and daily operations for a financial firm are all quite expensive endeavors and very few exchanges are charging fees at all at the moment. It seems to me that competition in the area today is based on who can raise the most VC money and stay afloat the longest until the number of exchanges out there shrinks sufficiently such that they can actually start charging and bringing in revenue.
It's a big speculative bet, and coming out on the right side of it could result in a fantastic return, but it's a very expensive and risky bet.  I bet after 1.5 years, their backers weren't seeing the growth they needed to justify the next step of holding on longer until people start paying for trading.
