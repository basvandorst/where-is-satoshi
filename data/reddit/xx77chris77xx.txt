I'm thinking like a father making an account to let his son use.

Yeah ok better safe than sorry anyways.

Do you think that using a bank account in the son's name on the fathers account would go unnoticed or do you think it would be best to have the father open a second bank account for the son to use. Would be a lot easier if they still allowed you to set up an account for a minor with parent/guardian permission. I'm just trying to explore all my options which there don't seem to be too many of.

Thanks for the tip, I'll have to look into them and see what I can do.

Does anyone know the legality of opening a GDAX account in the USA and allowing someone else to use the account on your behalf?

I would personally recommend you invest in bitconnect they have a volatility trading bot that takes advantage of the volatility of bitcoin and earns you about 0.9% daily interest on your investment. I would recommend you put a few hundred in to see if you like it or not and then you can move on from there. You deposit your investment in bitcoin so you should buy some and get yourself a good wallet. (If you could use me as your ref it would be very helpful, it wont hurt you to use it but will help me my username on bitconnect is xx77Chris77xx, but normal link if you prefer

I believe that Bitconnect is not sustainable at this rate for the long term but I have found zero reason to believe it is a straight up Ponzi scheme.

This is a mess. its been through several tumbling wallets with thousands upon thousands of transactions in each one. It's now looking like this has been going on since July of 2016. I'm going to try digging further back if possible. (latest wallet I'm digging through that has, through a series of transactions, transferred bitcoin to the end wallet listed above

There was a hack this morning affecting several bitcoin mining pools, including NiceHash ( where the pools entire wallets were emptied into this wallet ( before being transfered to another wallet at (

 This video goes over the math behind it and how it works. I do not see it being sustainable for too long into the future but I fail to see anything proving it to be a ponzi scheme. All I see is speculation right now.

I'm looking through the wallets past transactions and its looking like this has been a series of security breaches reaching back through early November. I'm going to keep digging around.

Its completely untraceable. the last wallet i could track it through was  and its had about 50,000 transactions through it since 2013. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:15:25
possibly? I'm not really sure since they stopped transferring everything.
