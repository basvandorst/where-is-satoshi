Jesus, calculator I found was way the hell off!

$1,000,000 a hundred years ago is not equal to the same amount today in purchasing power thanks to inflation. You would need nearly 2.5 million to purchase the same amount today.

I can't buy anything with a google search, so yea... pretty worthless.

Who? I don't follow anyone on crypto or gold/silver. I actually know very little about crypto itself other than its a digital asset that can be wiped out of existence very easily. 
It's just common sense to me that a physical medium of exchange is far more infinitely valuable than a digital medium.

Unfortunately it appears for the worse as we gain tighter and tighter reliance on technology and loose knowledge of the skills that got us here to begin with. 
I remember a few winters ago people were crying on facebook how they couldn't make coffee but were thankful they had a fireplace. Let that sink in... 
Had fire, couldn't figure out how to make coffee. That's just beyond sad. 
The Carrington event wasn't that long ago and will happen again. Had that large cme struck right now, your bitcoins would be worthless. You would never see them again. Even if you stored them on paper, they're nothing and no one would ever accept them.
We were unfortunate and lucky enough at the same time to learn the destructive power of our sun on electricity. Just because it hasn't happened again doesn't mean it won't happen. It's happened MANY times but we were lucky those flares weren't pointed at us at the time.

Cute, run the blockchain with your abacus.
Internet is what, 30ish years old versus roughly 10,000 years of gold as currency prior to the internet? 
Christ people are so quick to forget the old ways things were done. 
An apocalypse would certainly be entertaining!

True, the concept of value is only in our minds, but that concept is solidified with something physical like gold, silver, cash, etc.
CME hits the planet and all your digital assets are gone like they never existed.  I can't personally find the value in that.

A lot of people will waste money on crypto they can never physically hold in their hands yet refuse to invest in gold and silver which has true tangible physical value. Go figure...

Right, because its math and you're going to do all your transactions with an abacus.

Bitcoin is less anonymous than cash. You can't look at a dollar and tell who it's last user was. 
Everything digital is trackable. Everything.

No, that statement is 100% correct.  Let me build a portable emp emitter and point it where you store your bitcoins. 
Hell, even if you do that offline paper storage thing, a cme or emp is still going to destroy them as you won't be able to access them.
I'd love to see a grid down apocalypse scenario happen just to laugh at all you die hard fans of crypto and your bonafide religious faith in their value.

Everyone shares the same limitations with digital assets. Power grid goes down and you can't access them. CME/EMP hits and they're gone for good. Governments have been putting more and more control on bitcoin defeating the entire purpose of them to begin with which makes them seem less valuable and more vulnerable to me also.

Doesn't matter if it's legal or not.
