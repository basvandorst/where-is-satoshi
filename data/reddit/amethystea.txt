What you are doing is asking a mining pool to confirm your transaction in the next block they mine.  This will not get you every confirmation you need, but it will get it on it's way.  Some of the pools offer it as a free service with either a timer or number of requests as a limiter.

Nope:  You can try this to speed it up..

I must not be understanding something then.  When I input a limit buy for higher than the market price, it says "Error" and cancels my order.  When I do a Stop Limit Buy, it lets me.

They are probably multiple bots doing it.  Most bots are configured with either percentages or hard numbers based on support lines.  Look at some of the charted ideas on TradingView and you will see how people calibrate their bots (or their manual day trades too).  Other than that, some of them are a frenzy of people with FUD trying their hardest to get their sell in, people with FOMO trying to buy, or other people trying to put up walls by piling on top of other buys/sells.

I recommend the steel wool and kevlar ones.  Great tactile response and doesn't impede movement.

We are all waiting to see if we hit a bottom, or if it will trend down into 8,600 range before ascending again.  Might know in hours or days from now.
If you are planing to play the long game, then it wouldn't hurt to buy now.  If you are playing the short game, then you might want to watch the market for a minute first.  Either way, you should know before the end of year.  Check out TradeView to see what others are thinking, but remember that you should only make decisions based on your own assessments.

If banks are involved, they are closed for the holiday.  Could be why...

Probably for the best, unless you just don't mind spending a lot.  At current exchange rate, a medium one-topping would equate to ~$40USD

Maybe this?  
Never tried it myself

Don't accept advice on what the market will do, since you have no idea how or why they believe what they do.. or if they are just misleading you.  I would suggest to start learning to read charts, see what other people are assessing, and weigh your risk vs reward on that.  Markets do like to follow self-similar patterns, but past performance is not an indication of future performance.  Check out this site for some ideas:

If you are buying, a limit would be below market price.  It shouldn't permit you to post a Limit buy above the market price.

Has not been announced, looks like BCHEUR is next up:
Edit: it did say, my bad  "Update - The BCH-EUR and BCH-BTC books will now enter cancel-only mode and all resting orders will be cancelled. These books will be temporarily disabled until January 2018. "

Remember, too, that when you hodl and buy lower, the new purchase is going to pull your break-even point down with it.  Example:  Buy $100 worth at 13,000, then buy $50 worth at 10,000 would be the same as buying $150 worth at $11818.18181818181.
