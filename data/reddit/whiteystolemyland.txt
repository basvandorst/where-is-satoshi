I wonder if one of the Aussie exchanges I use is accepting American customers at the moment. I know it has in the past. There's a mark up on crypto prices in Australia and the exchange's fees start at 0.5% and go down from there. USD currency is also an option so it might be a good way to cash out and make some extra profit because of abitrage.

The Ledger Nano S allowed me to access my Bitcoin Gold which I sold for more Bitcoin. I will be even happier with my purchase once support for Monero is complete.

Independent Reserve is good. I am signed up to multiple exchanges, however, the fees at Independent Reserve are cheaper compared to exchanges such as BTC Markets. The site is also easy to use and I've also had fast and friendly customer service from them. 
If you sign up with Independent Reserve then you can use the referral code ZAYNMP
If you want to take advantage of arbitrage then you can sign up to multiple exchanges, buy bitcoins from one and then use the other exchange to sell those coins if the selling price is better at the time. 
Here is some info on the fees that might help you make a decision.

I bought a Keepkey because it also supports other crypto currencies. It's easy to use and has a nice sleek design. I feel a lot better knowing that my coins are safe on a hardware wallet.

I got one recently and agree with purpleyak0's statement. It also handles other crypto coins too. I'm just waiting for an update on when Monero will be supported.

Independent Reserve and BTC Markets are good. 
Independent Reserve's fees start at 0.5% and BTC Market's fees start at 0.85%. Sign up to both and buy from the exchange that provides the best price when you're looking to buy. This would also allow you to take advantage of arbitrage.

No one can time/beat the market and anyone who tells you that he can is full of shit. 
Don't invest more than you can afford to lose and keep abreast of all things cryptocurrency related. 
Just buy some now and hold onto it for a while. If after a while you want to invest some more then buy a little more.

There's a pretty friendly crowd over at that might have some helpful ideas for you. Why not make a cross post?

I notice others mention Shapeshift but the fees are high so I wouldn't recommend it.
There are altcoin exchanges such as Bitfinex, Poloniex and Kraken that you could use. Bitfinex has the cheapest fees at 0.20%. Poloniex is 0.25% and Kraken is 0.26%.
The exchange I've found that seems to offer the most for Bitcoin Cash at the moment is Independent Reserve. If you want/need a referral code then use ZAYNMP

Yeah, I wasn't a fan of point 6 either. However, IR is a good exchange. The site is well designed and I like the security features and I've always had good customer service. The fees are lower than numerous other exchanges and I was told that they're adding more altcoins this year.
Which exchanges do you currently use? 
@_date: 2017-11-01 08:30:29
If the price went way down then they'd probably use that as a reason not to buy.

If you want to avoid paying high fees and you are trading in USD, AUD or NZD then use Independent Reserve. The fees start at 0.5% and become cheaper because there are volume discounts. You can also buy ethereum there and it's a good place to sell any bitcoin cash if you have any. If you want/need a referral code then use ZAYNMP
Kraken is popular with European traders and if you are funding your account with Euros then maybe try Kraken.
If altcoins are what you're after then there's also Bitfinex and Poloniex. Bitfinex charges 0.20% and Poloniex charges 0.25%.

I'll copy and paste info from previous posts I've made. Ignore what you feel doesn't apply to you. If you dig through my history then you'll find other bits of info here and there that I've been sharing with the new influx of newbies.
"You can buy bitcoin using a credit card at Coinbase but you'll lose a lot of money to fees. Even doing a bank transfer costs you 1.49% in fees but the fee for using a credit/debit card is 3.99%. Some might also suggest Local Bitcoins but the price of bitcoin is higher there and there are exchanges that have cheaper fees.

You can fund those account with bitcoin that you bought from another exchange.

Also, if you start trading large amounts then buy a hardware wallet such as a Ledger Nano S, Keepkey or Trezor. It'll help keep your investment safe from hackers.
@_date: 2017-09-03 18:25:17
There's no reason why you can't be signed up to multiple exchanges and you can trade where you get the best value at the time. Don't forget to take fees into consideration too.

BTC Markets sells more altcoins than Independent Reserve so if you want to buy litecoins or ripple then use BTC Markets. When buying altcoins that I can't get from an Aussie exchange I buy bitcoin from Independent Reserve and then I transfer the bitcoin to an exchange that sells altcoins, such as Bitfinex, Poloniex or Kraken. Bitfinex has the cheapest fees at 0.20%. Poloniex is 0.25% and Kraken is 0.26%. You don't have to fully verify yourself when using those exchanges unless you're trading over a certain amount.

If you buy a lot of cryptocurrency then buy a hardware wallet to keep your investment safe from malware, hackers etc. Examples include the Ledger Nano S, Keepkey and Trezor. These hardware wallets will also work with some apps, such as Mycelium.
When using one of the Aussie exchanges you can fund your account from your bank account or by using Poli Pay. Poli Pay is a lot faster but you pay $3.30 or something as a fee.
If you want to sell your coins then you can sell them using the same exchange. You can sell them at the market rate or you can specify a price that you want. You can also sell them in person but you risk being mugged. Don't ever use Paypal to trade crypto because you risk being scammed. Some people also mention using Shapeshift to exchange currencies but the fees are so expensive so I wouldn't recommend it.
I hope this helps you.

Do your research when signing up to an exchange. The prices differences and the trading fees can really eat into your profits. Check my recent comments for some newbie friendly info. 
If you're planning on spending a fair bit on trading crypto then look into buying a hardware wallet to keep your investments safe from hackers. The Ledger Nano S, Keepkey and Trezor are popular.

It is of utmost importance that you write down the "seed" that you're given when you create a wallet. Do not store the seed on your computer and do not let anyone else know about it otherwise they can use the seed to steal your funds. Keep it hidden somewhere. If you lose your phone or if it breaks then you can use the seed to recover your funds.

If you are after altcoins such as monero, litecoin, ripple etc then use an exchange such as Bitfinex, Poloniex or Kraken. Bitfinex has the cheapest fees at 0.20%. Poloniex is 0.25% and Kraken is 0.26%. You don't have to fully verify yourself when using those exchanges unless you're trading over a certain amount. You can fund those account with bitcoin that you bought from another exchange.
Kraken is popular with European traders and if you are funding your account with Euros then maybe try Kraken."
Also, if you start trading large amounts then buy a hardware wallet such as a Ledger Nano S, Keepkey or Trezor. It'll help keep your investment safe from hackers.

How about storing it in a book? people are less likely to throw out a good book. It's easy to throw out a bunch of old papers.

You're a kind man and I'm glad the investment in bitcoin allowed you to help your dog. Now you'll get to enjoy each other's company for years to come. 
My dog brings me so much happiness. I'd give up so much just to keep her and make sure she's happy.

The seed is a random phrase that is used to generate your private keys. Your wallet can be entirely recovered from its seed. 
For example, if you download some bitcoin wallet software, such as Mycelium or Electrum, then you will be given a seed to write down when you setup the wallet. It's generally 12 words in length but it can be longer. 
Make sure you write down the seed and keep it safe and hidden. Do not store it on your computer. If anyone else discovers your seed then they can use it to steal the funds from your bitcoin wallet. 
If you start buying large amounts of crypto assets then it is highly recommended that you buy a hardware wallet, such as a Ledger Nano S or a Keepkey or Trezor. They help keep your bitcoins etc safe from hackers.

I dunno why people would give them money when you can get good quality content from the other porn related subreddits.

Monero is currently the only fungible cryptocurrency and it offers true privacy. It was the second currency to be adopted by those online darknet markets. 
People can face problems, such as having their exchange accounts suspended etc, if they unknowingly receive bitcoins (or other cryptocurrencies) that have been used in some sort of crime in the past. The privacy offered by Monero means you don't have to worry about "dirty coins". 
In addition, Monero has dynamic block sizes which can help with scaling.

Shapeshift is expensive. Use an exchange to get a better rate.

What hgmichna said. Mycelium gives you the option of using a Trezor or Keepkey hardware wallet if you connect it via an on the go cable. You can get an on the go cable very cheaply on eBay.

When my friend passed away his parents told me they found a fake sprinkler that had a piece of paper inside that had 12 random words on it and they asked if I knew what it was.

You could move to Singapore and take advantage of the 22% income tax rate for income in excess of $320, 000 SGD. If you are a citizen of a country that will also charge you on your overseas income (like the USA) then you might want to renounce your citizenship first.

What this user said. If you own a large amount of Bitcoin then it is highly recommended that you use a hardware wallet for security. Trezor, Ledger Nano S and Keepkey are all good hardware wallets.

Are you going to do some hands on activities to keep them interested? 
For example, getting them to setup a Bitcoin and/or Monero node and a mobile wallet? 
I like 's idea of the puzzle and winning some Bitcoin.

I'm running a Bitcoin node and a Monero node on an old Macbook and I'm thinking of making it a TOR relay when my internet connection is upgraded next week.
I'm trying to think of other ways I can put the laptop to use but I can't think of anything else at the moment. Perhaps I could run folding even if the CPU is only a 2.4ghz Intel Core duo.

As others have said, you've missed the boat when it comes to mining. It's only worth it if you have free or extremely cheap electricity. You'd be much better off investing that money into buying Bitcoin.

You will need to sign up to one or more exchanges in order to buy Bitcoin. 
Independent Reserve is a reliable exchange that has low fees compared to other exchanges and there are trade volume discounts. You can trade in USD, AUD and NZD. The help section will give you a lot of useful information on getting started:

The CEO, Adrian Przelozny, also posts on here and will answer any questions you might have. 
If you want/need a referral code then you can use the code ZAYNMP when signing up. 
If you buy a large amount of Bitcoin then do buy a hardware wallet to store your cryptocurrency.

I'd pay for the app without advertisements. I really like that Mycelium is compatible with my Keepkey.
