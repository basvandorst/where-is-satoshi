Look at MySpace. Nuff said. You, personally, with your beliefs, don't dictate what the entire world will chose as the main crypto wealth storage. Mp3 was flawed and nothing could take on the cd. Nothing could take on aol shares. Evolve or die miserably.

So you felt the need to post about it. That's how much you don't care. Rrrright.

Honnestly, I own btc and still believe in it for now, but let's be realistic, by 2020 it might not be relevant at all anymore. At its actual pace eth will overtake it in as little as 20 days.

I'm new to the game. Bought for 1000€  (a third of my amazing savings) on the 7th that I can afford to lose, to leave me time to learn about it all and bought again during the dip at 13k. I did exactly what a veteran would have done except he'd have bought at 12k. Newbie does not necessarily equal weak hands, more like "did you think mp3 in 1998 had no future and was a niche for pirates that could never take over the cds produced by majors" ? If so you were blind and/ or an idiot. That being said, emule is no more and btc could deserve the same fate if it does not evolve.

It's seductive but there is a big flaw in your reasoning : by 2140 it will be long forgotten and replaced by something much better, first of all much lower fees if any.

I would be very, very quiet about it.
