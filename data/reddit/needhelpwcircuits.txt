Had the same exact thing happen to me, I emailed Coinbase and got this:




 I called Expedia probably 5 times and worked my way through their call center. Talked to an American eventually and they promised me a refund. Never got it. Eventually gave up because it was taking up way too much of my time. If you are refunded please let me know. I still have all of my emails with Coinbase and my order number, so if you are refunded please let me know what worked for you because I'm still out nearly $100.

Most of the comments are negative. This is a project that seems to check most of the bitcoin lovers' boxes:
Decentralized, using Bitcoin Blockchain, Disruptive, etc.
If you consider the implications of this project succeeding in their ambitions, it would probably be very good for bitcoin. So I say, good luck and ignore the naysayers and just work on making the best Code Valley you can.

Yeah me either. It's kinda insane that rate of change!

I did a search of my /Bitcoin directory and then my whole computer and still can't find it. Feel like a real noob right now.

I'd like help in order to do this myself. I tried using -dbcache=4000 in the Console window of the client but it didn't work. Also I saw somewhere that you can edit the dbcache using the config file, but I can't find that either. (It's not in %APPDATA%/Bitcoin)
Can you explain how I can do this or point me in the right direction?

He said it on bitcoin.org in Jan 2009.


first 4 years: 10,500,000 coins
next 4 years: 5,250,000 coins
next 4 years: 2,625,000 coins
next 4 years: 1,312,500 coins
When that runs out, the system can support transaction fees if needed. It's based on open market competition, and there will probably always be nodes willing to process transactions for free.
