So its only storing the blockchain? Nothing more?
@_date: 2017-02-17 23:00:28
But what are these IP's doin?
If you click on a IP you can see transactions relayed.
Is every node doing this? Relaying transactions
@_date: 2017-03-14 13:45:22
But why doesnt blockchain.info connect to every node.
PS; i currently have 17 active connections to the blockchain network
@_date: 2017-03-14 10:13:49
When will blockchain.info use my node for these transactions?
@_date: 2017-11-11 22:30:38
It has just been confirmed!
I just tried to boost it but it already had 1 confirmation
@_date: 2017-11-14 14:52:56
I downloaded the blockchain. Could you tell me how i can view it?
@_date: 2017-11-14 14:36:32
So could i also just view it using the bitcoin core client?
@_date: 2017-11-08 16:17:49
COuld you tell me how i can import my ledgers xpub or just the ledger wallet?
@_date: 2019-01-26 13:43:05
The reason why Ledger is not fully open-source because the secure chip is under **NDA.**
Trezor is not using a secure chip like the Nano S/Blue/X, that why they can publish all code.

Could you explain to me what would happen at the the time of the fork?
@_date: 2017-10-28 14:13:31
Amazon still have them available
@_date: 2017-10-28 21:58:20
@_date: 2017-10-28 14:13:50
No i want to buy more in the future
@_date: 2017-10-25 11:14:08
In my bitcoin core settings their is a option called database cache size: 450mb. This is the same right?
@_date: 2017-10-28 09:08:01
Yep im thinking about buy more BTC or other crypto in the future.

Im just using a normal harddrive. Im now checking my disk with a SMART test. Maybe the harddrive is just getting old
@_date: 2017-10-26 20:14:57
A few weeks ago i bought a game on steam. Thats why it took 6 hours to complete the order. It had to have a minimum of 6 confirmations
@_date: 2017-10-25 11:33:20
Thanks its going faster now. I have 8GB of ram and i changed it to 4GB
@_date: 2017-10-26 17:45:43
Yes i mean unconfirmee transactions
@_date: 2017-10-25 10:59:41
Ehm i dont think so. Could you tell me how i can increase it?
@_date: 2017-10-24 07:56:34
Where do all these words come from? Because it are all just normal english words
@_date: 2017-10-28 08:45:00
