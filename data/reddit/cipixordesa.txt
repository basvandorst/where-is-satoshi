In EU also works nice bitboat.net or bit2me.com. You deposit cash to any bank ATM and instantly get BTC, no ID, no verification. Only that they have a markup of 7-9%. But consider that the price of anonymity :)  
Try Mycelium local trader also.

I have a location, surrounded by mountains (a real Citadel place), beautiful place.  
I need to start a crowdfunding plan to buy the land and start building.  
Anybody interested?

My daughter was using that plugin on her testing e-shop  Works just fine.  
Made some sells but now she's focused on other things (grown up).

If is P2P decentralized way of buying through the wallet, yes will be nice.  
But if is another "controlled" exchange, NO WAY!

Hmmm, that paypal button is a disgrace next to just a link of pay with Bitcoin... why not ONLY Bitcoin?

Smart move. Yes using a shapeshifting method will be good. Jaxx wallet have integrated shapeshift, but due to this particular Coinbase case, I suggest to use directly shapeshift.io and then back to any of your personal wallets.  
I hope that now you learned the lesson about exchanges like Coinbase...

I did it even better: ordered some manchego cheese for some friends in Spain from  paying with BTC through LN. They even personalized the labels with ones showing "Bitcoin HODL" cheese and  on it.  
I think that is a real example for "you see? Bitcoin can be used to buy food, not only drugs".  
[Here is what they received]( paid with BTC/LN.
