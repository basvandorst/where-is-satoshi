We wish.
The US has pushed increased AML/CFT reporting regulations on other countries before (and recently). And it's not like you have to transact in USD to get caught up in it. This is done through the FATF (an international "strategic inter-governmental body") writing up the required legislation, and the member governments implementing it under threat of:






So, that's why you can't accept anonymous fiat in exchange for BTC legally in many, many countries. Let your citizens do so, and you can kiss your latest round of free trade agreement negotiations bye-bye.


But unless you're cooperating with the regulations of the governments that control whatever fiat currencies you accept for exchange, it still gets pretty messy quickly if they decide to make trouble for you. Remember, it's about the actual exchange, not just what the price is denominated in.
And just BTW, what's with assuming USD is what we "officially price Bitcoin in" at the moment anyway? I guess it might seem that way if you live in the US, but AFAIK it's not "official", and even if it's de facto for comparisons over time, it's basically of little practical consequence for the other 7 billion of us. (Partly, thanks to those same regulations the US forced on us; I can only buy from someone in my own country (who's going to want "real" (local fiat) money, not greenbacks), who is required to see and record the details of a government-issued photo ID)

I'd agree in theory, and in principle too. It's just not so in my experience.
