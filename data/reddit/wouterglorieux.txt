Yes, i think mass production of hardware wallets will be the cause of the next boom, and the cause of the next crash will be when there are so much transactions it creates a (temporary) traffic jam-scenario

Yes, Thank you. I was talking about the blockchain.info api. I'm trying to determine if all other api's return the transactions of a specific block in the same order.

Actually, it has always been open-source, i just never made any publicity before. I've been working on it for several years already, this is the third version of the Bitcoin Spellbook, i started from scratch again a little over a year ago. 
It's not really intended as a library, more as a general toolset for bitcoin stuff. Besides the rest-api server there are also a bunch of command line tools like a transaction listener.
There are a few example apps included in the source code to give an idea what is possible. Apps like a bitcoin splitter service, lottery, notary service and even a payment processor.
The basic idea is that you could use this for any bitcoin app you can think of just by combining certain triggers and actions.
I have a live demo of a notary service that is powered by the bitcoin spellbook online on my website [ (the front-end is made with [wix.com]( just because i hate front-end development and that was the easiest way to make something, but you can make the front-end with whatever you like)

Take a look at my Bitcoin Spellbook project, in the listeners directory there is a transaction listener, it a command line tool that you can use to monitor specific addresses when they receive or send a transaction and execute some command when an event is detected

The transaction listener is a stand alone tool, no need to set up the bitcoin spellbook server (its not a bitcoin client, more like a ifthisthenthat server but for bitcoin). The transaction listener uses the websocket from [smartbit.com.au]( to listen to all newly broadcasted transactions.

TL;DR Swarm is dead, Joel tries to put all the blame on his Belgian Pretty Boy co-founder.
All I know is Jef already left in January, yet nothing was ever mentioned about that.

It was supposed to be a decentralised crowdfunding platform, but it never really worked
@_date: 2016-05-23 14:55:38
There is also a simple voting mechanism and a lottery mechanism you might want to check out in there

I'm not telling wallets to self-limit their functions, quite the opposite, I would love more functions if anything. I'm only using standard functions that are available in all wallets so people who want to use my tools don't need any extra software.
The reusing of addresses is only necessary so an address can be used as an identifier for someone.
Version 0.1 is already finished and available on github. 
I'm only launching a crowdfunding campaign so I can continue to develop this further, up untill now I have been funding this myself.

Check out my "Bitcoin Spellbook", especially the "DistributeBTC" bit, it does exactly what you describe.

Heb je toevallig een link voor die bitcoin meeting in Gent?
@_date: 2013-12-17 20:02:22
Thanks, ik denk dat ik even zal binnenspringen op 7 januari.

I just ordered my very first bitcoin meal on pizza.be today, maybe they will call me too.
It all went really smooth, i am definitely going to be doing this a lot more in the future.
