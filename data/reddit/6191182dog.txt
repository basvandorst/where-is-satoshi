Where is South Korea when you need them? They have absolutely no volume at all. I’m guessing them and China due to lunar year celebrations price is down as well as volumes
@_date: 2018-01-31 04:33:28
The dude is just that smart. Lightning Network was his idea I believe

The market is finding its value. Everything is overpriced and valued. Still in its infancy. Stay strong and hodl. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 15:01:51
Hate to say it but future contracts and is some buuulllllllshit. It’s pretty much on point after contract ends at lower price Btc drops.

@_date: 2017-12-02 14:21:47
Haha pretty accurate!
@_date: 2017-12-26 05:04:47
I’m confuse! Did you sell or not? If not what’s all this crying about
@_date: 2017-12-28 02:52:31
S.korea is a powerhouse in crypto. Pray that they don’t ban it and just regulate it. Its 50/50 right now
@_date: 2018-05-22 21:20:31
Bitcoin is not going anywhere, the love for bitcoin is just as strong. The lost of credit cards and most banks support destroyed the volume. Simple 
@_date: 2018-05-07 16:14:06
Conservative old man thinking is kicking in for Bill. That’s all, nothing to see here
@_date: 2018-05-29 01:24:54
Damn manipulators are really trying to kill this market. But they can’t kill it, just only prolong the parabolic pump to the moon.
@_date: 2018-05-24 13:07:40
Let’s see if the TA’s are right, pump to 7500-7800 then dump 5k-6k. Bastards! 
@_date: 2018-05-19 14:06:33
30k if regulations kick in, and institutional money starts pouring in. 
@_date: 2018-05-26 21:16:40
Bitfinex low volume is getting scary. 
@_date: 2018-05-30 16:58:53
You guys need to seriously follow TA, this dump close to guarantee to complete the triple bottom. Stop your crying noobs
@_date: 2018-05-01 03:22:00
It’s been the US bailing out the world since the crash. South Korea has been a no show and japan hasn’t done much either since most of them bought in long time ago. No whales in Europe but trout and gold fish.

It’s just the noobs! We were all like that when we first started. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:12:02
Where is this comfirmed?
@_date: 2017-11-10 18:40:15
People were predicting 6k by the end of the year. Now the sky is falling because it dropped down to $6500? Lol! Imbeciles

Noobs always lose
@_date: 2017-11-06 19:41:39

And another decentralization?!?

Sheep thinking^
@_date: 2018-03-09 00:49:06
Finally, someone with sense and good perspective. You focus only on the price it will eventually get to ya. Remember this technology is only in its infancy. Alot of great things soon to happen. HODL
@_date: 2018-03-16 20:26:47
Wow, even if it is untrue why try to debunk sometime so minimal. I can see if it said the dude made millions. Article saying something positive about Bitcoin, why not. Here you come with negativity trying to spread nonsense. Too many of you clowns on here
@_date: 2018-03-29 14:36:30
Buy orders at low 7k are insane. Don’t think it’s going to make to 6k :( dammit haha
@_date: 2018-03-31 02:05:18
At least their thinking positive. Nothing wrong with that. 
@_date: 2018-03-11 01:24:05
Lightning needs to hurry the hell up already, or better yet take your time so we all can buy more cheap coins. 
@_date: 2018-03-18 17:46:23
Noob! Go ahead and panic sell already and be done with it. You obviously haven’t done any research on cryptocurrency, period. All you noobie clowns worry about the damn price. Sell sell sell
@_date: 2018-03-18 18:30:56
Lol he does indeed. Or that’s just the good ole OG Kush talking
@_date: 2018-03-03 21:38:32
The big crash scared away most of the noobs and new money. Will be awhile before we gain new money. Damn whales, see what you did ha
@_date: 2018-03-23 20:25:00
Plz do! 
@_date: 2018-03-16 20:29:00
Exactly! The point of posting this just shows to the sheep that don’t know anything about bitcoin will get some sense of Bitcoin m. That it does have value. Take the story for what it’s worth. 
@_date: 2018-03-11 05:21:54
And another bitcoin is deflationary.

To think the US will go to war with Russia is a joke. For one their won’t be no war just complete destruction of both countries if not the World. And both sides know that. But who knows with Trumps dumbass
@_date: 2018-03-19 17:53:25
Probably due to the Trump news!
@_date: 2018-03-11 01:31:58
Exactly, this ain’t the stock market, go all the way down or all the way;) 
@_date: 2018-03-16 23:58:48
Can we go to 5-6k already and get this over with. WTH are these day traders smoking? 
@_date: 2018-03-30 00:49:07
And quit crying like little BEEEOTCHES
@_date: 2018-03-11 03:18:46
Just working better because nobody is using it? The numbers are the same. Bitcoin use casr has not dropped substantially. Peer to peer is used just as much or not more due to segwit implemented. LN is just around the corner that no tech out there can compete. 
@_date: 2018-03-22 16:48:28
Doubt that, coming up to two HUGE resistance points. The death cross is amongst us. With the current volume we will easily drop below the 200 again 
@_date: 2018-03-02 20:49:23
Yes, 100% agree! May all shitcoins die!! 
@_date: 2018-03-08 02:16:38
Btw, no noob here, been in the trenches since aug 2016 playa, just never got around to aak that question. 
@_date: 2018-03-12 18:56:15
Honestly don’t know what will kick up the price back to ath, other than LN being implemented and ETF’s. There has been good news almost everyday for weeks. This is very unlike anytime in bitcoin history. Never seen it like this. Damn mtgox withdrawals might killed the momentum we had for ar least q3. Fuckers��
@_date: 2018-02-22 14:09:46
Yea, let’s hope it goes down to 6k again so we can we wait another month for gains. Brain dead.
@_date: 2018-02-02 08:28:20
@_date: 2018-03-11 06:15:50
Technology is always ongoing.  Bitcoin has been working since the beginning. Has it not? Just because recently a huge influx of user flooded it’s market causing slow speeds and high fees doesn’t mean it’s now useless. From Aol to email to now. Takes time. Price wise, just a year ago bitcoin’s price was what? $904! Don’t let the recent price fluctuation fool you about the tech itself 
@_date: 2018-02-14 02:29:20
All these new shitcoins makes me want to make one. Easy money for sure.
@_date: 2018-03-29 04:17:55
@_date: 2018-02-23 20:24:09
Maybe in the past, but of lately Bitcoin has been unpredictable as hell. Day traders are satisfied with 4-7% gains then dump and repeat. And most noobs that got in around Nov-Dec are out or out of fiat to invest. The initial crash was not good for the market. Pushing out, all of the newcomers is terrible for the market. Whoever tells you otherwise is stupid. Mostly day traders investing now reason why VOLUME IS LOW
@_date: 2018-03-08 16:56:14
And btw this market is still baby young, so analyzing the market comparable to the stock market is brain dead. The tech is still evolving to be a world changer. SO EVERYONE FOCUS ON THE DAMN PRICE IS FORGETTING ABOUT THE REASON FOR TGIS TECH. Wake up
@_date: 2018-03-12 19:08:19
Agree! But it will be alot easier to brand it per say vs just decentralized currency. It will definitely take time but the word will get around very fast. The media is looking for something to talk about Bitcoin other than its high increase in price. 
@_date: 2018-03-11 05:23:20
Your talking technology that’s in its infancy. Altcoins are still infants compare to bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-03-11 03:16:34
Name one positive thing about bitcoin that gets immediately shut down? Most these brain dead negative comments about bitcoin are from noobs. That maybe do 10-20 mins of research and they all of a sudden know what btc is. AND NAME ONE ALT COIN MORE EFFICIENT AND SECURED THAN BITCOIN. 
@_date: 2018-02-28 16:51:14
This is like 2 months old
@_date: 2017-09-11 04:59:49
This is laughable!! What a joke! People just trying to create even more panic. If true, so be it, but don't try edge people on to sell their investments. Losing China temporarily would be a big hit, but no way in HELL would it kill bitcoin. You clowns need to stop this nonsense. 
@_date: 2018-02-24 19:48:57
The hype was real, but also is the tech. Cannot overlook that.
@_date: 2017-09-13 20:30:21
I'll take one, when the price dips;)
@_date: 2018-03-08 17:19:01
Agree, most people are sheep unfortunately, and buy on profitable speculation and what’s trending at the moment. Hoping on better representation of a currency, accessibility, speed, and access with LN will bring huge mass adoption. Of course one can only speculate. 
@_date: 2018-03-11 00:21:33
Can it go down to 4-5k already. Stop teasing us. 
@_date: 2018-02-23 00:51:31
Exactly, these guys are comparing past bubbles to when they were in their prime. Btc and alt coins are still new. 
@_date: 2018-03-14 17:06:44
I hope this time is it. Needs to go down already and stop teasing us
@_date: 2018-03-08 01:47:24
Noob question: why so much more volume when the price dips hard? Is it just that many weaklings selling? Bastards
@_date: 2018-03-08 02:15:21
I ain’t never the one to cry when this happens. Just curious, and of course who doesn’t like seeing profits. Always sucks, but it is what it is. In it for the long run. 
@_date: 2018-03-30 00:47:59
What was our low in feb? $5900k? Anything lower than 6200k, the RSI will go lower than 30. And the RSI has only gone lower than 30 twice. Big pump is inevitable at the level. Do your homework noobs!
@_date: 2018-03-11 02:42:05
The technology is their, thats obvious. If you are having time believing that, your focusing too much on the price. Don’t be a sheep like 80% of this community. Patience is a virtue. Rich overnight phase has passed. In due time when the technology is ready, the moon will just be a waypoint. Mars is the real destination
@_date: 2017-09-17 08:23:18
Here we go... another so called expert on everything, claims bitcoin is a bubble. Of course, only knows about bitcoin and its beginning. Never mentions anything about the tech
@_date: 2018-02-28 00:17:27
Everyone is on the sidelines watching. Don’t want to get caught in another bear trap. 
@_date: 2018-02-24 16:29:46
Once Lightning is implemented, and more structured regulation is in place 100k won’t seem impossible.
@_date: 2018-03-22 13:41:36
Prepare for the Death Cross noobs! 
@_date: 2018-03-09 02:19:22
166k Bitcoin left to sell lol. We’re fucked
@_date: 2018-03-11 02:42:24
@_date: 2017-09-21 05:21:46
Haters! They have no idea Bitcoin's true potential! It would take alot more than one huge economy and misguided journalists to bring down Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-09-20 17:31:55
Too are many are investing in scam &amp; shit coins hoping for a quick huge return 
@_date: 2017-09-14 23:31:13
Impossible to predict that. Yes, China had big contributions on the ride to 5k, but remember bitcoin and cryptocurrency is still in its infancy stage. Once it goes mainstream with more user friendly dapps. Good night! Rocket ships will go pass the moon ��
@_date: 2018-03-07 19:27:46
It’s down, oh well! Buy more or sell and leave the market. Enough of the cry baby shit, and hoping to get rich overnight. Damn, feels like there is just kids investing in this shit. The whole market is in its infancy, only speculation at the moment, so prices will drastically fluctuate. 
@_date: 2018-03-11 05:25:26
Try learning about something before you try to tear it apart. It’s obvious you bought ath, if you wait just a little bit longer maybe you gt some gains. Oh better yet, invest in stocks, and maybe for the WHOLE year you’ll get 4% gain
@_date: 2017-09-14 23:04:09
Wait until tomorrow. China will decide to regulate the rest of their exchanges 
@_date: 2017-09-17 03:57:45
@_date: 2018-02-28 20:23:20
Hell yea! Our moon trip has been postponed long enough, dammit 
@_date: 2018-03-22 21:22:40
A bubble popping doesn’t mean end game. It’s actually healthy, especially for cypto with these shitcoins, hypecoins, wannabe’s, etc
@_date: 2017-09-16 00:20:25
 
@_date: 2018-02-21 20:35:41
Simple, the one whale that took a big dump yesterday triggered this selloff. Can’t blame him. Oh well, here we go again. 
@_date: 2017-09-18 18:06:28
Damn all this ban talk! Enough is enough. Yesterday's news
@_date: 2017-09-21 15:13:54

Sir yes Sir! 
@_date: 2017-09-21 05:17:56
Damn! If this is all legit intel on bitcoin's future plans. Above and beyond for bitcoin
@_date: 2018-02-22 12:58:11
Still don’t understand why in the world would whales day trade with expensive ass BTC and not alt coins? I’m sure they would get much bigger gains. 
@_date: 2017-09-17 17:53:14
Dumb post
@_date: 2018-03-11 05:18:38
Haha ok I’ll name one, peer to peer. 
@_date: 2017-09-12 02:41:30
Of course everyone wants the lambo today not tomorrow, but if China were to ban exchanges we would just have to wait a little longer. Patience is a virtue 
@_date: 2018-03-22 16:49:07
The Ugly ass Lambos will have to wait��

@_date: 2018-03-12 19:10:52
LN if successful, could wipe out credit card use with its scalability alone. 500,000 to 1 million tps vs 30k no match. My numbers could be wrong though, just throwing shit out there
@_date: 2018-02-27 15:25:17
Lmao! Right
@_date: 2017-09-27 23:13:36
@_date: 2018-03-29 04:20:25
This guy knows very little. What spike the prices in December was institutional money not noobs coming in investing peanuts. 
@_date: 2018-03-04 07:56:18
Exactly, retards will soon understand that later. It’s getting ridiculous 
@_date: 2018-03-11 05:20:22
I’ll name another incredibly secure, and impossible to hack. Unless you have a quantum super computer. 
@_date: 2017-09-11 05:01:38
Exactly, it's obvious these dumbs fucks are working overtime to get us to panic and drop our investments, so they can buy at a low price. Fuck these clowns 
@_date: 2017-09-11 04:47:01
The weak will panic no matter what you tell them. Who cares if China bans bitcoin, will just have to wait until cryptocurrency goes mainstream then our ride(investment)will take us to the moon
@_date: 2018-02-13 15:58:26
Certainly looks like, with all these new huge sell orders at $8600. Volume is not big enough to push through
@_date: 2017-09-17 03:58:30
@_date: 2018-03-08 16:54:11
Terrible analysis! Someone pulling huge amounts of Bitcoin will easily cause a selloff in any market. Call it what you what. Bubble so be it, but every market that is healthy now was a bubble at one point. 
@_date: 2018-03-23 00:21:02
Yup all about getting out of this death cross
@_date: 2017-09-20 17:30:53

I’m sure its one whale doing this. Taking profits with his ballin ass��
@_date: 2018-02-27 23:55:38
Bastards need to give up already take down the sell walls. 
@_date: 2018-02-23 02:29:23
Really don’t understand why people are hoping for it to go down to 6k again, just so they can buy cheaper. It took alot of great news and firepower to  bring the price up. I’m afraid it won’t come up as fast as before. Too many investors got burnt. Thanks whales��
@_date: 2017-09-18 18:03:30
China volume is below 10%. The masses sold out a week ago
@_date: 2017-09-27 23:08:50
It won’t dip! Too much positive news up and coiming. And especially tomorrow with upbit opening there exchange
@_date: 2017-09-14 23:33:21
Hell yea! My thoughts exactly! F*Uk the haters. 
@_date: 2017-09-11 05:17:23
Big News... ONLY ON WSJ?? Lol, what a joke
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:00:41
Bahahahahaha this guy! You have a time machine or something bro
@_date: 2017-09-25 06:46:07
This sounds like old news!

Haha this guy
@_date: 2017-09-12 04:20:10
????! This saids nothing weak sources already said already. Why the fuck are people still posting this stupid shit? There should definitely be an age limit in here. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 23:31:13
Impossible to predict that. Yes, China had big contributions on the ride to 5k, but remember bitcoin and cryptocurrency is still in its infancy stage. Once it goes mainstream with more user friendly dapps. Good night! Rocket ships will go pass the moon ��
@_date: 2017-09-17 19:49:57
People in here are just starting to post the first thing that pops in their head. Brain dead post

Bahahahaha! Haters are going to hate 
@_date: 2017-09-21 20:59:29
Im sure the weak hands are still worrying about china. 
@_date: 2017-09-12 02:38:48
Bitcoin is still not mainstream yet brotha. Yes Jackie Chan plays a big part in the crypto space, and its value. But its just a matter of time no one economy will have any or no impact on Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-09-25 18:02:15
You better hope no war. We all will be in trouble if that happens

Who cares about Russia? They broke anyway. They contribute nothing to crypto currency 
@_date: 2017-09-22 14:50:59
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:50:48
I really don’t understand the major concern. If you really understand this market and tech, their shouldn’t be any concern what so ever.  The tech alone should have you seeing this as a buying opportunity, PERIOD. The brain power and governments supporting this revolution make this the strongest market in history. It’s not going anywhere. It’s just the noobs that haven’t got around to do much research are thes ones that are concern. 
@_date: 2017-09-10 20:07:39
Damn, when, where, and how? 
@_date: 2017-09-25 17:51:49
No temporary blip, no sure if most cryptocurrency community have realized the news South Korea Kakao upbit will be opening an exchange. And how big this is. And the next coming weeks bitcoin will see a substantial increase weather you like it or not, PERIOD
@_date: 2018-02-22 23:20:46
Yea, alts are getting destroyed as well. Can’t wait for this shit fest to end. Too much dumping lately
@_date: 2017-09-17 03:58:20
More like they dislike bitcoin. And will start their own cryptocurrency.

Lol, nice one!
@_date: 2017-09-26 01:14:08
Haha 
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:51:29
There will always be weak hands in investing. That’s how whales and strong hands make money. What people are forgetting is the whole reason why most “smart” investors got into crypto. It’s not going anywhere. The tech will only get better guys, and so will the value. Hodl!!!!
@_date: 2017-10-29 20:08:23

Bahahahaha! Yes, plz do, i prefer to buy at a lower price:)

Haha in 6 months there will be alot more then just speculation pumping the prices up again. Decentralized exchanges, hundreds of thousands of merchants in SK accepting crypto, ETF’s, LN, fiat/altcoins, regulation implemented in all major countries, Russia back in crypto in july, the lost goes brotha. Emotions are whats driving the market now and of course all the DAMN complaints here on REDDIT HAHA
@_date: 2017-09-14 23:33:21
Hell yea! My thoughts exactly! F*Uk the haters. 
@_date: 2017-09-16 23:35:44
Sounds very promising. Hope this rocket ship is big enough for all of us:) 
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:05:08
Wise words have been spoken! The lazy that choose investments with their eyes closes will be the ones that get burned. 
@_date: 2018-02-21 00:20:07
Bahahahahaha! Whoever bought those tokens should get arrested as well. Wtf
@_date: 2017-10-21 05:29:38
Haha! Nope, it want! You guys think whale that are buy now are big time? Try American institution investors
@_date: 2018-02-04 02:45:52
Damn clowns keep dumping. Was hoping for 10k, but still more sales then buying
@_date: 2017-10-09 02:14:24
Lol bahahaha
@_date: 2017-10-21 15:45:56
For the split! You think people who are not whales are making a huge profit in Bitcoin? 
@_date: 2017-10-09 02:13:31
If LedgerX happens this week then it will go way over 5k
@_date: 2017-10-05 23:07:29
Same here. Way too many players! Everyone wants to be Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-09-27 23:09:17
@_date: 2017-09-12 05:39:17
@_date: 2017-09-19 21:47:44
Because China's Bitcoin volume was only 10-15%
@_date: 2017-09-16 00:26:05
Cool! Yea, its due for an update.
@_date: 2017-10-21 05:27:24
Yup! Buy Buy Buy Bitcoin!!! 
@_date: 2017-10-21 05:31:19
With Ledgerx opening the doors to billionaire investors, Bitcoin price won’t drop for a long time
@_date: 2017-09-14 20:32:23
Bahahahaha! Yes, plz do, i prefer to buy at a lower price:)  
@_date: 2018-02-23 00:49:52
The thing that is different is cryptocurrency is still in its infancy. The value is still low. Bitcoin still needs work. So does Exchanges and alt-coins. So no way in hell you could compare it to past bubbles.
@_date: 2018-02-03 04:23:44
Really wonder wants Japan’s take on current situation. They are really fully invested into Bitcoin. Haven’t much from them
@_date: 2017-10-10 17:27:50
Majority of Russia is broke anyways. We don’t need their participation 
@_date: 2017-10-09 18:21:45
Well i guess no burst then. Hacking bitcoin is literally impossible 
@_date: 2017-10-02 19:25:07
Looks like we do need China! The whales are getting dry
@_date: 2017-09-14 23:04:09
Wait until tomorrow. China will decide to regulate the rest of their exchanges 
@_date: 2017-10-21 15:37:53
$42,000?? Where do you get these numbers? Are you from the future? 
@_date: 2017-09-16 00:20:39
Crypto pro
@_date: 2018-04-04 17:27:27
Ok, this got to be the last dip before the pump. Or this is truly being suppressed by the so called “Cartel”. Makes no sense. 
@_date: 2018-04-01 14:44:37
There is nothing we can do against corporate elites with trillions of fake dollars to play with. They will just keep printing new money. They will do the same with this market as they did with gold and silver
@_date: 2018-04-01 14:18:15
@_date: 2018-04-17 20:00:55
The time it took to go up 12% is irrelevant, if it still stayed below the trend line. Data is never meaningless in any market. 
@_date: 2018-04-17 23:07:10
Agi will dominate the whole market, 3 years, EASY!
@_date: 2018-04-04 17:56:44
Really? Source? Sounds like awesome news
@_date: 2018-04-01 14:40:36
The attacks on blockchain have been heavy since December. All part of the elite manipulationto hurt the market
@_date: 2018-04-17 19:33:13
With the 50 day still crossing the 200, the resistance is strong. RSi is high and stoch is trending down so this was inevitable 
@_date: 2018-04-13 21:58:46
Most don’t understand trading brah 
@_date: 2018-04-05 01:34:53
Time for the real flush out, plz!!! With a little dab of volume, moon it is �� . 
@_date: 2018-04-07 21:29:22
If people can stop selling from prices $7k to 7500 will be fine;) 
@_date: 2018-04-04 20:28:01
With that big ass sell wall I doubt it.
@_date: 2018-04-17 20:01:11
You think these whales trade blindly? 
@_date: 2018-04-06 17:53:22
Don’t think shorting Btc is never going to stop. Especially with stupid cme futures. It’s all bad.
