Local cleveland business certainly need all the boost they can get.

Maybe the fact that DARPA is involved only proves that it was not the US government who created Bitcoin? And that the US government is actively trying to replicate it?

It is. Because it does way more than Bitcoin ever did. It provides literally anonymous spending and hoarding of your money.
It provides the ability to skip out on your taxes.
There, I said it!
