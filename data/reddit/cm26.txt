Can you exchange bitcoin for cash in this machine?

Yes I have sent you my order info multiple times!! This is frustrating how it takes so long for you took look into something, but come back asking for the information I have already provided you. Im not owed much and I just wanted what I paid for. Is that too much to ask for?

I sent you a pm with my order id and have yet to recieve the bitcoins I was owed. Just wondering if you got that message?

I messaged support last friday when the purchase was made. I still didn't recieve a response so so thats when I messaged you specifically. I just want to get this figured out. Thanks for taking your time to look at this for me it is much appreciated. Just let me know if I need to do anything else. Thanks again.

Doubt it he has been trying to "help" me with my refund for a week now. Still nothing. 
@_date: 2013-04-17 20:54:47
I sent a pm with all of the order info and account info. Just let me know if I need to resend it. Thanks!!

That it was, but that is not the problem. I was quoted to receive 3.03 bitcoins and only received 1.94. Like I have said in past messages I am just looking for is the remaining 1.09 bitcoins I have already paid for.

Then will you credit me also. I was quoted 3.03 bitcoins and only recieved 1.94. This is unacceptable and it is negatively impacting bitcoin. I messaged support and still have yet to recieve a response.

Whatever man thats what you all said to me but I did not receive the full amount and have yet to be refunded. I have given my info to you multiple times and nothing has come of it. 
@_date: 2013-04-17 22:43:59
I just resent it in a pm. Thanks again for working on this for me.

Do not want you to do the work for me just point me in the right direction by giving me some sources. I will go through the sources and use the information that I find helpful. I could very well not use any sources you provide.
