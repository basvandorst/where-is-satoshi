DIGITAL CURRENCIES are not FDIC insured. Why? Because digital currencies cannot be FDIC insured, only USD in US financial institutions can be FDIC insured.
If Coinbase has secured private insurance for their digital currency hot wallet, that's one thing. But guess what? It's not FDIC.
The only thing potentially FDIC insured that Coinbase uses is their bank accounts, in US dollars, at a US financial institution.

No trained officer, or anybody with weapons training, ever does anything except shoot to kill. Center of mass is what you're going for when you use a firearm.

Your photo from ATM camera + biometrics from FB and FBI databases, for one.
Throwaway cell phone? Is it really a "throwaway"?
Did you:
-Purchase the phone yourself? (so you're on camera doing so)
-Pay cash for the phone...or pay in a way that can be traced back?
-Pay cash for the airtime...or pay in a way that can be traced back?
-Take your own car with you to the store to purchase it? (cameras in parking lot)
-Activate the phone from a wifi that can be traced back to you?
-Have you ever turned that phone on anywhere geographically that could be tied to you?
-Did you cover the cameras with tape on both the front and rear of the phone prior to first turning it on?
-Have you ever logged into anything from that phone that is tied to you? Email, Facebook, etc
-Made any calls from the phone to people that you also contact in your everyday life?
-Did you carry your everyday regular cell phone that's tied to you when you bought the throwaway phone?
-Have you ever carried your throwaway cell phone and personal cell phone simultaneously with both turned on? (or with both batteries plugged in?)
And so..so much more.
**Now apply many of these security vulnerabilities to your trip to the Bitcoin ATM.**
Unless you're straight up going commando, there is *always* a paper trail.
Is anyone going to chase down all this bullshit because you bought an ounce of weed on AlphaBay? Nope...but that doesn't mean there isn't a paper trail.

Not blindly, mind you. Do your homework. If you're confident, that's all YOU need to know.

What you're referring to is called "Structuring"...and proving intent in these cases criminally is very difficult absent an admission or actual provable intent. 
But Civil Forfeiture is definitely a possibiity.
The $10k limit applies to Cash Transaction Reports (CTR). If you deposit more than $10,000 in cash, you will be required by the bank to fill out a CTR. If you intentionally structure the deposits to avoid the CTR, a bank will likely file a Suspicious Activity Report (SAR) with FinCEN. Banks file so many SARs annually it's unbelievable. I'd bet every Bitcoiner that has ever purchased Bitcoin through Coinbase, Circle, etc have had a SAR filed on them.
"File early...and often." is the expression in banking compliance.
Long story short. Go peer to peer for your Bitcoin trades.

The cool part about Abra and why it works is there will never be a shortage of tellers. People in the recipient nations of these remittances have a very low wage. Where I live in SE Asia, the average wage is about $150 per month. That's $5 a day.
Even if there are fees charged by Abra tellers, there will be great competition amongst them causing rates to remain low. I'd guess 2-4% in a market with a lot of tellers. A lot of people are going to want to become tellers if they can earn $10-$20 a day. To a lot of people in the world, that's a fuckton of money to earn daily. Finding tellers in every locale of these recipient countries is going to be easy once people realize the costs are lower, and funds arrive faster than other methods of sending money.
The only problem I see for Abra is onboarding customers in the least invasive way without killing them with KYC requirements and while still keeping fraud rates down.
Can a person have a teller come by and pick up cash and have it sent via Abra to someone in another country? Now THAT would be the killer fucking app. 
Money transmission laws could also get tricky..if you're into that sorta thing..

Your tax accountants are misinformed.

You buy 2 Bitcoin for $400/each...so $800 total.
You wait.
Bitcoin is $500/coin a month later. You take those 2 coins and buy the $1000 camera.

Guys, listen.
Companies like Coinbase and Circle are, and have been since their beginning, filing SAR (Suspicious Activity Reports) with the government for something as innocuous as you sending coins to a tumbler. 
If you tumble coins, you're most likely a terrorist. No, no....you're not just a privacy conscious person, **you're a darknet market drug dealer and/or pedophile.**
Despite what Coinbase and Circle may publicly claim, they comply with nearly all federal law enforcement inquiries...and ALL subpoenas. **They have to or they go bye bye.**
YOUR privacy is not Coinbase or Circle's priority...or even consideration. They want to make money...and throwing their users to the wolves isn't something they have moral qualms with.
Act accordingly.

I think you mean Cash Transaction Report, or "CTR'...not a SAR. Also, this only applies if he withdrawals the money from a bank (i.e. his bank requires this form) -or- he purchases coins from a regulation following MSB that requires the form because he's paying in cash.
If he takes $10,000 in cash he already has in his possession and buys coins from someone that is selling that isn't an MSB, there would be no report.

BIOS firmware and/or unknown hardware keyloggers that log and store data independent of the HDD.
You use a computer to perform a seed restoration offline. Then use DBAN or something to wipe the drive and reinstall the OS and continue using the computer.
But once that computer goes back online, the hardware keylogger transmits all the keystrokes it's stored since it last connected to the internet...thus compromising the seed, password and any other vulnerable information.
For 100% security, get a computer and only use it ONCE to create your seeds...then cut it up with a angle grinder and throw it in the ocean.
This all assumes the software you're using isn't compromised somehow in advance.
Or...there is a secret radio device in your computer that somehow communicates the keystrokes via radio signal mesh networks, similar to how new "Smart" electric meters work in the United States.
In that case, get a Faraday bag and use it to encase the laptop as you work. Make sure the battery is removed prior to the laptop leaving the Faraday bag.

Companies like this will inevitably replace SWIFT, SEPA, Fedwire, ACH, etc.
This area is actually where I see Bitcoin's largest potential. Imagine a BTC market cap of $200 Billion, with deep liquidity providers in every country. You could facilitate a great deal of value transfer in a pool that large. 60 minute international settlements. The currency conversion fees aren't going away, these companies need to make money somewhere. But at least these fees will be way more transparent due to less intermediaries.
The only hurdle I see here is the established banking cartel and their lobbyists. Then again, they'll probably buy up companies like Wyre anyway when they start getting big.
But that's Wyre's exit strategy anyway, most likely. Get bought up by JP Morgan Chase.

Unlike most people that spend their lives pretending, hiding...from everyone, especially themselves, you never really *know* most people. Trusting most people is incredibly difficult because of this innate human tendancy to be fake, and therefore manipulative.
But with guys like McAfee, it seems like what you see is what you get. In a world of pretentious, Facebook-dwelling fakers, I'm way more inclined to trust a guy that can be his honest self in public. That says a lot about a person. Instead of cultivating some fake public persona like most people spend their lives doing.
Having said that, you're right. He *could* be wrong about cryptocurrency....nobody is infallible. But I think you know better than to doubt him on that point, or you wouldn't be here :)

Spend one of the unconfirmed transactions you have access to with a 0.0009 fee. It's called a Child-Pays-For-Parent transaction.
The network will try to confirm the 0.0009 BTC transaction ahead of others bc of the high fee, and in the process, confirm the parent transactions where you only used a 0.0001 BTC fee.

You would not need to prove this unless you were charged with a crime. In all likelihood, you are not going to be charged with a criminal offense stemming from an incident like this. As an MSB, you fulfilled your responsibility of filing a SAR for the incident.
As far as the possession of the drugs in a car, there are many variables that would determine whether or not a driver, a passenger, or both the driver and passenger would be charged with possession. Details in a case like this matter for a conviction...although charging both occupants is routine if neither admits the drugs belonged to them.

Maybe not your cup of tea...which is probably why you don't understand it. People have different outlooks and come from different backgrounds.
Some kids in the ghetto of the US have an average life expectancy of 25...and they are raised observing this very fact. The idea of growing old with grandkids isn't even a thought in their minds.

Wow, 3 or 4 houses? A lambo?! A regular Rothschild.
Homey, that ain't rich.

"Rich" is the guy who has 20x that and connections in local government. You know, the guy that knows about the US-funded investigation/arrest before it happens because of his connections in the local Thai government, and disappears to Isan province or something.
Cazes was a dumb whiteboy that never learned being white in Thailand makes you a nigger in a Thai person's eyes...and nobody likes to see a nigger succeed. 
Yes, I said nigger. Because that's the best way to accurately describe how Thais view white people living in Thailand.
If you're black and in the US, you know exactly what I'm talking about. No matter how decent of a person you are, how educated, how generous, how likeable, most of the time you're constantly reminded of how certain people **really** see you. White in Thailand? Yeah, you're a bank machine nigger.

There is absolutely 0 chance the US Government was able to confiscate all the coins in this case.
The BTC-e guys have been operating for 6 years, openly flouting US law by dealing with US customers...and did so in a quasi-anonymous way. There was a **lot** of thought put into the security of their coins and their OPSEC.
When you operate the way BTC-e does, your disaster plan always comes back to, "You may get one of us, but you won't get the money."
I believe the expression in certain circles is, "Out of reach".
Unless the FBI is going to Russia physically to get the bulk of these coins...no way they seize more than some hot wallets kept on the servers.
Russian authorities are notorious for telling the US authorities essentially to go fuck themselves during investigations. I know of dozens of criminal cases in the past like this. They ALWAYS wait for the suspects to vacation in a country with better diplomatic relations...and then the US pounces.

You treat the 10 like a 6...and she'll never leave you alone. Everyone else treats her like a 10, why not you? They literally can't handle this.
You treat the 6 like a 10. Why? Because a 6 has low self esteem because, well...she's a 6. Become her self esteem salvation...and she won't leave you alone.

If so, go on LBC and make a "Sell" listing for Western Union for 2-3% above Bitstamp. Someone will bite quickly, and you'll have a WU to pickup within 2 hours in your name. Afterwards, release escrow on LBC and the sender of the WU gets the coins.

Honestly, you know absolutely zero about the Kangaroo court known as the US federal criminal court system.
They can say whatever they want. Seriously, whatever the fuck they want. Grand juries are a joke...and as the expression goes in the feds, "They could indict a ham sandwich."
Quit believing the good government nonsense you've been told your entire life. You've simply been lied to.
If you were aware of the sheer amount of abuse in federal prosecutions, starting with the fact that prosecutors have entirely too much leverage in how cases are charged...all the way to the disproportionate sentences handed down in nearly every federal criminal case, you literally wouldn't believe it.
When the government "good" guys seem to get away with so much misconduct, you suddently find yourself rooting for the "bad" guys, more often than not.
Start here: 
If by merely pointing out the inequalities in this system is cause for you to proclaim a person is, "defending shady anonymous people"...then the act of you discounting potential prosecutorial misconduct is essentially like you also saying, "government has no accountability to follow the law that they purport to uphold".
You have a lot to learn.

I don't think you realize how things like this actually play out in the developing world in countries like the Congo.
You are an unsecured creditor to banks in most countries. Bond holders are senior, meaning...good luck recovering.

You don't need to convert to fiat to be taxed from using Bitcoin.
