Yes I have many beautiful coins and I show her my Blockfolio every hour ( not the dips ;) ) ... unfortunately she is strong in the monies and not impressed.

If I send bitcoin to an Ethereum address what happens?
@_date: 2017-12-11 05:46:21
She says Adreas speaks very poetically about Bitcoin as a currency... however Bitcoin is now a store of value not what it was envisioned to be. Transaction fees are far too high to and the volatility is insane...
@_date: 2017-12-11 08:16:26
As I remarked, as huge as my gains are she has more through regular FIAT channels...so is like meh
@_date: 2017-12-11 08:05:47
I've been investing a small amount every week since 2014 after I bought quite a few. Your right I have my own stash she knows how big it is, not as big as hers ..yet! But if I could persuade her to invest we could make a lot more! That is the point of this thread!
@_date: 2017-12-11 05:42:22
2) ...If everyone is HODLing and there are no Bitcoins left to buy and no-one is doing transactions why is Bitcoin a currency? 
@_date: 2017-12-11 08:13:53
I think people are scared to spend because of the gains you make by HODLING. I added up all the Bitcoin I have spent and by today's Bitcoin prices I have spent roughly $120000 but the goods I bought are only worth $1200. So that's her argument, people are using Bitcoin as an Investment, a store of value instead of using it as a currency. In that case with nothing backing it how is a viable investment? I can't seem to win that argument with her.
@_date: 2017-12-11 08:02:19
She is testing my HODL resolve! But yeah you're right you get an upvote :)

Yep I know just trollin’
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:43:34
You will be charged $100+Fees in about 6 days and get your Bitcoins. You can then sell them which will take another 7 days and cost you more fees. If I were you I would relish the fact you are along for the roller-coaster ride with the rest if us and HODL.

That should be "hodl a lot and spned a little"
@_date: 2017-08-29 20:13:13
Always a good time to buy!
For starting out I recommend 
Purchase through CoinBase
Then Transfer to a hardware wallet   ($99)
Other have their favorite setups.
@_date: 2017-08-29 20:52:47
If you purchase today it may take a week for the BTC to land in your Coinbase Wallet. There will be a transfer fee to move the Coinbase BTC to the Keepkey. This transaction cost is a bit high right now so you could wait a bit... Coinbase is very secure as it stands but most of the community prefers to be in charge of their own private keys.
@_date: 2018-06-18 19:09:02
Take my upvote dam you
@_date: 2017-08-11 23:12:53
$3725 ... 
@_date: 2017-08-29 20:40:08
There are some cheaper ones but the Keepkey has a digital display to confirm transactions which I like a lot. Otherwise I think most 'fancy' hardware wallets are around $100/$150
@_date: 2017-08-05 18:10:28
Be happy if you made a profit! I sold 3 BTC at $990 ... if that makes you feel better!
@_date: 2017-08-29 20:08:48
I picked up 25 GBTC at 350 before the split. I am still wondering how they are going to factor in the BCC into the price. Any ideas?
@_date: 2017-11-03 04:25:00
Good point.
The difficulty of the puzzle to find new bitcoins increases the faster it is solved. This is to maintain the 10 minute interval.
If a quantum Computer starts solving the puzzle in nanoseconds the puzzle would be so hard that all other miners would be locked out and would stop mining .
Unless they upgraded to Quantum computers... 
This is what we have seen with the CPU/GPU/ASIC progression.
So as Quantum Computer Tech becomes mature miners will adapt to it to keep their edge. 
The Bitcoin net however would be lightning fast :)

Haven't Cried in a long time...
@_date: 2017-11-14 04:23:16
The short answer is ..Yes!
@_date: 2017-11-01 23:48:06
It's unbelievable!!
@_date: 2017-11-03 04:42:38
Remember TitanBtc knows the private key that's imprinted on your coin... So if they are hacked or an Insider goes full wobble..
Transfer the coin to another wallet try bread wallet for instance.
@_date: 2017-11-16 20:39:12
Do it... in addition take out a 100K loan and add that. In 6 months pay back the loan with Profits and restore your nest egg. You will then have free bitcoins!

Hmm GDAX requires me to Scan my License to make trades even though I have a Coinbase Account...
@_date: 2017-11-04 20:49:15
Doesn't the difficulty decrease the less people who mine?

Excellent simple way to explain Private key generation.... 
@_date: 2017-11-09 01:25:24
$2.1 million ... don't move BTC stoned kids ;)
@_date: 2017-11-04 20:45:23
Download the Keepkey beta. Under your Bitcoin Account you will see your BCH. Simply transfer it where ever you want using Keepkeys Built in Shapeshift. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 06:28:09
I was one of those :)

Current Interest Rates are at 0.02% So if you opened a savings account you would make the same money in .. yes 4 years!!
@_date: 2017-11-17 23:26:34
So once you have the means to generate private keys how do you:
1) Determine how many keys to generate
I assume you keep scanning the block chain for these keys being used until you get to one that hasn't been used yet. 
2) Determine which keys have been used for transactions
I seem to recall each blockchain block transaction contain a a piece of the private key which can be used to find the public addresses. You would have to scan the entire bloackchain to recover the wallet correct?
@_date: 2017-11-01 17:11:01
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:25:31
Done :)
@_date: 2017-11-17 23:15:10
FYI I have a keepkey

The answer is to buy small amounts on the same day every week and not worry about it.

I buy Karma Koin Cards on eGifter with Bitcoin. I then use the Karma Koin to Buy World of Tanks gold. Four years of that ... if I had HODL the bitcoin could have bought a real tank ;)
@_date: 2017-10-14 13:14:30
This is sound advice. I have given many paper wallets  (using Bitcoinpaperewallet.com) and perhaps 2 out of 5 have lost them.  I didn't think to keep backups because I thought they would spend the Bitcoin.  None of them did because they thought it was a gimmick and I was a nut job. Now it's worth several hindered bux they are crying...
@_date: 2017-09-05 22:54:14
Actually I believe it was this article that caused the huge drop
@_date: 2017-10-28 18:56:08
Still no sign of BCH being added to the fund. If they work off 144000 btc then they should be adding something right? I sold mine I don't trust these guys.

Man I still don't get it... so if I currently have 5 Bitcoin I will have and 5 Bitcoin and 5 BCC? What if BCC goes to 10000 and I sell one ... will I still have 5 Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-07-28 22:14:13
Thanks for the reply...I think I get it! 
1) BCC is free money but will probably be worth nothing
2) BTC, no change still heading for the stars...
