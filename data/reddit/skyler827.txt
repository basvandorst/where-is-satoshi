they don't need billions.  a bitcoin transaction is about 10-30 dollars, so to overwhelm the network they need $50 per transaction.  the network can handle 7 transactions per second.  so 7 *50=$350 per second or $30.2 million per day.  they could do this for a whole month before ever spending 1 billion dollars.

Here's how it will probably work: You well need to open one payment channel with a bank.  You will pay a transaction fee one time to open the channel.  The bank is connected to hundreds of other banks, so at most 2 or 3 hops away from all banks.  Any store, business, service provider or whatever has an account at a different bank.  So you will send a payment through your channel to your bank, your bank will pay your business's bank, who will pay the business on your behalf for whatever goods or services you are buying.  3 or 4 hops at most.  2 hops if you have the same bank.  Nothing ever goes on the blockchain for each transaction, all thats needed if for you to have a channel with your bank,for every bank to have channels with many other banks, and for every business to have a channel with a bank.

The whole point of a trezor is to prevent hackers from stealing bitcoins.  Previously, if someone could run code on your system, your bitcoins could get stolen.  With Trezor, physical intervention is needed to authorize a bitcoin transaction: the system can only send requests.  At bare minimum, a single authorization button is essential.

I agree with you in theory, but anonomization is expensive.  It's simply not worth it for most users.  I believe that all governments will welcome bitcoin once they get the tax avoidance possibility under control, and for that, the will need to be able to surveil the network.  However, just because the state knows which transaction represents taxable transactions, such as income payments, that doesn't mean that it will be impossible to anonomously pay people.  Various laundry systems, centralized and decentralized, will always exist.

(For me, I primarily use bitcoins as an investment.  That means I have a financial interest in the long term price appreciation of bitcoin.  I bought it not because these problems have been solved now, but because I believe that they will be solved in the future.  So of course I rush to defend bitcoin.  What else do you expect from the bitcoin community?)
So to make me give it up, I would need to see a clear message from governments around the world, particularly rich nations, that bitcoin is unacceptable for lawful commerce, because the Fed cannot control it's supply.  Other laws related to money, such as know your customer/anti-money laundering/tax compliance/auditing/fraud protection all could in theory be applied to and satisfied by bitcoin, but control by monetary authorities cannot.  If this becomes a problem, it's game over.

What is your point?  Are you saying that Wells Fargo is a corporate scumbag? If so, you're entitled to your opinions.
Are you saying Wells Fargo is the mafia?  If so, bullshit: the article linked clearly says that Wachovia/Wells Fargo had KYC/AML policies that they simply failed to follow.  A Mafia is a criminal enterprise running an intentional protection racket.  Wells Fargo never threatened anyone and paid all damages due from the charges.  Furthermore, note that Wells Fargo helps people send billions of dollars every day, and manages Trillions.  A few billion that were used for crime back in 2006 is not, in the context of Wells Fargo, a big deal, especially if they paid the fines for it.

1. Seizing drug money does not count as regulation of bitcoin.  It will be sold in due time, and the Federal Reserve will have had no role.

3. I don't support tax laws, but as written, capital gains tax and income tax laws do too apply to bitcoin, if you sell for profit or get paid in them.  Sales taxes may apply, but I don't care to determine the extent thereof.

This is kind of tragic for me to read.  For me, I've been a libertarian for most of my adult life, but from my experience with bitcoin, I'm slowly coming to understand the role that the state plays in the regulation of the economy.
I think Ron Paul is wrong here because the Feds have *not* interfered at all with bitcoin so far, and look what's happened: instability, uncertainty, bitcoin seems to be unable to reach its potential and businesses are hamstrung by fear and liability.  Fundamentally, business can't work their magic without credible guaranteed protection in advance from the government.
For bitcoin to succeed, governments need to make a credible guarantee to enforce their business contracts.  However, the way things are now, most bitcoiners aren't paying taxes on bitcoin transactions (consumer spending, capital gains, etc) and the IRS hasn't done squat on enforcing compliance.  However, if the IRS gets their shit together and finds a way to make our tax laws work with bitcoin, then government regulators might want to decide what contracts to enforce and under what terms.  This could provide the certainty that bitcoin will need to go mainstream.

If your computer never ever connects to the internet, and all software was downloaded securely, in advance, from a trusted source, you are immune to malicious hacking.  Connecting to the internet is a risk because it breaks this immunity.

Ok, let me get this straight: This is a new way to generate a master private key, that can be used to generate any number of bitcoin private keys, and a master public key, which can be used to derive (and pay) any number of bitcoin addresses.  When someone wants to pay, they look at the master public key, generate a random number, do some crypto-magic, and get a bitcoin address that is statistically impossible to collide with any other address nor publicly associate with the published master private key.
I think that is correct, but answer me this:  How does the owner of the master private key figure out when an address he has never seen before gets a payment, that he has received money?  If it is sufficiently collision resistant, there must be bajillions of possible addresses.  Does he do some kind of hash of every transaction in the blockchain?

That's true, that's why I said bare minimum.  Of course, a small screen showing the amount and the first few letters of the spend target would protect against the attack.  However, even if it's not ideal, a single button wallet would still be better than nothing by being harder to attack.
In the single button-no screen scenario, the trezor module would have an API for not just requesting transactions and getting the signed transaction, but also checking the most recently submitted transaction request.  So if a malicious app wanted to redirect payments, the user's bitcoin wallet could see that another app was sending unauthorized requests to the trezor.  This setup could still be hacked, but the attacker would need a way to automatically compromise any and every bitcoin app ever installed, and get all of those apps to lie to the user about API calls received from the trezor.  This would require the attacker to gain root access, source code of all bitcoin apps, and an ungodly amount of time, skill and experience with android system interception.  I sum, it would not be easy.
Of course it would be better to have a trezor with a screen, but if this is what an attacker would have to go through to steal bitcoins, it's far better than nothing.

No one knows the answer to this.  Furthermore, no amount of historical knowledge enables us to predict the future.  The following is my personal **conjecture**, based on my intuition of the technology involved, scale of the bitcoin economy, and experience in seeing public posts about hacks/other problems:
* Most secure option: cold storage (ie a computer that has never touched the internet: **No one** has ever lost bitcoins to malicious hackers this way)  It is impossible to estimate how many lost bitcoins due to data loss.  Risk factors: not backing up your wallet, attempting to use a disconnected computer on the internet, manually modifying bitcoin software
* 2nd best: paper wallet/flash drive (very safe, if your computer wasn't compromised when you generated them)  Roughly ~**1 in 100,000** have lost bitcoins by *malicious hacking*, and perhaps **1 in 1,000** by *accidentally spending them incorrectly* upon withdrawing them.  Risk factors: generating bitcoins on an insecure computer (hacking) or using different software for creating/withdrawing bitcoins from a paper wallet/flash drive (accidentally spending them incorrectly)
* 3rd best: Desktop client (keep your computer secure!! but generally safe.)  Roughly **1 in 5,000** have lost by malicious hacking.  Risk factors: running untrustworthy software, not having an antivirus program/UAC, not encrypting your wallet.  (I do not consider blockchain.info to be in the same security class as a desktop application\*)
* 4th best: smartphone app/Blockchain.info\* (If you do this, be VERY careful about your other apps.  Thefts can happen anytime bugs are found in iOS or Android, and a malicious app is running)  Roughly **1 in 500** have lost by malicious hacking.  Risk factors: Running questionable apps on your phone, not encrypting your wallet, publication of a mobile security exploit.
* WORST Security: On someone else’s' website (Get the out as soon as possible)  Roughly **1 in** ~~200~~ **400** have lost by malicious hacking, or theft by the website operators.  Risk factors: leaving coins there for a long period of time, the website is fronting a business that isn't making a fair profit.
\* For more information on why blockchain.info is not in the same security class as a desktop application, see: [This post](  That said, no major (publicly known) security breach has ever been discovered in blockchain.info.

Most actual paradigm changing inventions fail because they're not implemented correctly, or because they are not feasable until you can combine them with other technologies that are yet to mature.  For example:
Myspace (Invented social network, but required better public computer security/privacy/web infrastructure).  Microsoft tablets (Invented tablets, but required cheaper hardware/better software).  Flying cars (Invented air travel, but requires too much energy, still stuck on cars/commercial flights)  Segway Scooters (these are just dumb, motorcycles are better)  Communism (Requires a new system to coordinate production, we're still stuck on democratic capitalism).  Zoroastrianism (Introduced monotheism, but failed to take over the world, superceded by Cristianity/Islam).
All of these technologies could have changed the world, but their implementation wasn't good enough, so others came later and improved upon them.  Many such technologies cannot be efficiently implented at all.

Think of it like this: bitcoins have private and public keys, and if you know another person's public key and your own private key, you can send money to them.  But with credit cards, there is no encryption technology: All credit card information is like one big private key.
Would you be comfortable giving the merchant your private key, which would technically allow him to take any amount of money he wants out of your account?  Heck no.  But that's what happens every time someone swipes their card.
To make it work, we need huge institutions, like banks, credit card companies and financial regulators, to hire lawyers and technicians and fraud monitors and certification and tons of other crap.  Also, we need to build huge barriers to entry and maintain their security to keep people who have stolen credit card information from abusing it, even though such measures are ineffective anyway.  To pay for it, merchants pay big fees and usually take the full hit in cases of fraud.  It's not efficient or fair.
Bitcoin perfectly solves all of this.  The merchant asks for money, you give it to them.  No one ever had or will have the technical ability to take any amount of money out of your account except for you.  No third party needed, no regulator needed.  All you need is to keep your own computer or phone secure from hackers.

If any nation decides on a single policy for all transactions, the economies of scale with automated computer systems can make it cost practically nothing.  Computers are already handling every step of the process, this would simply require a call to something such as:
    irs.gov/report_bitcoin_transaction.php?TXID=314159?BTC=1.2345?USD=1000 
whenever someone buys or sells bitcoins, and could be TLS encrypted.  The IRS would need to do a bit of blockchain analysis to connect the bitcoin purchase on the exchange to the store, but in most cases there are trivially few transactions in between to sift through.
@_date: 2014-01-08 07:57:40
The current law is unenforcable.  It requires people manually account for all of their bitcoin transactions and calculate their tax on their own.  No one is doing that.  Even if they wanted to, no one is even sure how to do that.  No one knows what obligations they may have, no one knows weather to classify it as a capital asset or foreign currency (and consequently what rate to pay), and no one knows how much information the IRS really has, or if they will use it to assert tax obligations.
If legislation like this passed, at least people would know.  Business would know.  Banks would know.  We might not be able to kill the volatility, but the legal uncertainty would go away.  More banks would offer deeper bitcoin integration, and it would become much easier to buy and sell.
As it stands now, only people who are extremely well capitalized and prepared to weather all risks, financial and legal, can afford to trade in bitcoin.  If it stays that way it is now, the bitcoin economy will never grow beyond a certain point (quite possibly very close to its current trade volume), and most of the specualtive value in bitcoin will dissappear.

I think it will be stable when people stop investing in it and only use it for buying and selling goods and services, and the economy or economies using it stop growing or grow slowly.  People won't stop investing in it until it stops going up/stops being risky.  It won't stop going up or risk going down until the market gets a good grip on exactly how big the bitcoin economy will ultimately be.  This remains an open question.  It might never be answered completely.  
If/when it is answered, you just divide the size of the bitcoin economy by the money supply.
As for how big will the bitcoin economy eventually be: that depends on how valuable micropayments really are, how easy is it to buy and sell bitcoin, how much of a hassle are banks to deal with, how much demand for sound money is there in countries with high inflation, etc.  Banks are probably in a better position than anyone to answer these questions.  However, I think two things are clear: bitcoin isn't going to disappear, and its not going to displace all other currencies everywhere either.
As for me, I'm still long.

I disagree.  Bitcoin is indeed unavoidably coupled with issues, especially the two big ones, one of which is material and the other of which is institutional.
The primary issue with bitcoin is that its value is too unpredictable to be used as common money.  For bitcoin, this issue is a material issue: money is coming in and out of the economy as confidence in bitcoin waxes and wanes.  Furthermore, another issue with bitcoin is security.  Because most people aren't good with computer security and/or can't read source code, they need to trust bitcoin hardware wallet manufacturers, web service providers or at the very least, client application developers.  For bitcoin, this is an institutional issue.

Matching a face to an ID is computationally expensive.  That's why users need to wait when they register.  Validating a hand scan, on the other hand, is much easier to do quickly.  If they didn't do this then you would have to wait a few minutes every time you bought or sold while they analyze your ID and face again.

I agree, but (assuming governments tie tax obligations to bitcoins via the blockchain,) the use of coin mixers would now carry a new risk: you might become liable for the basis of someone elses coins.  This would be especially scary if governments started working together to create a common database of all bitcoin exchange records.  If that happened, and your bitcoins got mixed with some that were bought at low prices from someone in a country with high tax rates, you could suddenly owe a huge chunk of it in taxes.

Bitcoin is a currency that has a substantial disadvantage against fiat currencies:  You need computers to use them, and access to the international market to cash in or out.  It won't be comparatively favorable to fiat currencies unless the cost of inflation were greater than this cost.
Inflation has been declining all around the world, for several reasons.  For one, nationalism was huge in the 20th century, so govenrments printed more money, started more wars, and destroyed paper currencies early and often.  Nationalism is weaker today in most places.  Furthermore, economics, thanks to increased education and the internet, more people understand economics.  More people understand the effect of expansionary Fed policy on the general price level.  International markets have also grown, with more and more people being more free to hold foreign currency, so currencies compete in one way or another for people to save with them, whereas before the average american or european or japanese investor had little to no option of holding foreign currency.  Bitcoin itself has increased the pressure on Central Banks to control themselves as well.
But I think the biggest reason has got to be related to the tendancy towards savings in a capitalist economy.  Over time, capital structure should expand, and the general supply of savings, which represents the supply of capital stock, increases as more tools are built, more machines are constructed, and more systems are configured.  Technological growth has fueled the economic expansion in the 20th century broadly, but the computer revolution has accelerated this trend, giving more leverage to central banks to print without effective inflation.
All of these factors favor the fiat currencies.  There may come a time when nationalism rebounds, when technological innovation and expansion slows or stops, or when people unlearn economics, but that's not today.  Of course these things are happening, but not at the rate needed for bitcoin to effectively help (with all of its own costs).  IMO, Bitcoin will not take off until conditions are favorable It will take a few years for such conditions to develop in any one highly industrialized region.  Until then, the world simply isn't ready.

People didn't voluntarily accept banknotes over gold.  In 1862, Lincoln declared US Treasury Notes to be Legal tender, and imposed criminal penalties for accepting them at less than their face value.  Until that time, bank notes were *not* accepted as gold, but as debt, and thus less valuable.  $5 in gold was worth more than $5 in Treasury notes, so you needed $6 in treasury notes to buy the $5 thing.
This changed with Lincoln, and it made bank centralization possible.  If people could accept any currency for whatever price they wanted, they wouldn't trust bank notes, especially if they had a 10% reserve ratio.  If someone tried to pay me in Bitcoin bank notes with a bank that has a 10% reserve, I would accept it for only 10% of the face value, and no more.
Legal tender laws, combined with price controls, would be necessary for banking to centralize under bitcoin banks.

If I do this, then you could say that I'm misrepresenting the owner of the funds I'm trading with, and therefore violating Mt Gox's ToS, or instead that I am engaging in unlicensed financial services without reporting to the SEC.  I don't feel that the second act is necessarily a crime, nor do I foresee any way that the IRS would have any way of knowing the he has any bitcoins.

Every bitcoin can be traced to a block reward.  However, in most cases the block reward was a long time ago and completely unrelated to the current holder of the bitcoin.  Furthermore, only nodes running the bitcoin software and communicating with miners will see where new blocks are coming from.
So if someone is running a bitcoin node and observes the winning block come from your computer, he knows the reward block went to your ip.  As far as I know, this information isn't stored anywhere, and obviously isn't available for bitcoins descended from old block rewards.
It's probably fine to use your coins as they are, but if you're doing anything fishy with them, I would recommend you launder them.

Whoever spends them first.  Bitcoins are associated with a public key, and everyone who downloads or views the public block chain can see which public key has which bitcoins.  But to send bitcoins away from one address and to another address, you need the private key.  If someone copies your private key, then you should create a new public address and transfer them out of your compromised address as fast as possible.

If your laptop crashes, and you didn't backup your bitcoins, the bitcoins are gone forever.  So you should always encrypt them and back them up in multiple locations.
To see why bitcoins can't be copied, you must understand how they are accounted for.  The bitcoin software works by creating a public record of all transactions, from the genesis block to the most recent transfer of funds.  Every transaction is sent out to every other network member the client is connected to, so when one bitcoin node says "Bob sent 45 BTC to Alice and here's his signature: hyu34905g83g" this message will be spread across the bitcoin network and will eventually go into the public record.  If Bob copies his key and someone tries to spend his money, a similar message will be produced, but the network will not accept this signed statement: "Bob sent 45 BTC to Thief and here's his signature: hyu34905g83g" because the other nodes will see that his address has no money in it.  So bitcoins can be copied, sort of, and they can be transferred, but they can't be spent twice.

[Electrum]( is an open source BITC client that can send/receive coins, but does not download the entire block chain.  It starts up instantly and there is no wait time, **ever**.  I use it to store my coins, and I recommend it to anyone who wants a rock solid client that they fully control yet at the same time don't want to download the entire block chain.
Not keeping a copy of the block chain does have a potential risk you should be aware of:  The client will ask another server how many coins are in your public address.  In theory, these servers could lie to you, which means it is theoretically possible for them to tell your electrum client that you have BTC you really don't have.  To compensate, when receiving BTC, always check blockexplorer.com or blockchain.info on a trusted connection to make sure that you really have your coins before delivering merchandise or performing services.
The server your client will connect to will never see your private key, so it is impossible for anyone to steal your bitcoins without breaking into your computer.  You will be solely responsible for keeping your computer secure and keeping your wallet backed up.  The good news is: you don't need to trust anyone else to keep their computers secure.

If enough people wants them, their value will go up.  This would benefit the people who own bitcoins.  If demand is weak, the price will fall and bitcoin holders will lose.  Because their supply is increasing (for now), demand must increase for any price to stay constant.  Simple supply and demand.

Well clearly copying the bitcoins themselves isn't theft, but using them (spending them) clearly is.  Under current law, copying copyrighted software is copyright infringement/theft, and using it is an associated right covered under copyright, which is also infringement.  Of course I don't like IP, but makes me wonder.
I am inclined to think that copyrighted software is different, since all copyrighted software is is a set of instructions that runs on your machine to turn various kinds of information input into output, and once it's paid for (or stolen) it could theoretically be used forever, because it is not dependent on any sort of marketplace.  Bitcoins are dependent on the market to have value, otherwise they'd be useless bits that I can't spend.  If we don't legally protect the bitcoin, then they will be more costly to hold, so they will be worth less, but separate (private) enforcement mechanisms will probably be created, such as trusted secure cloud services that
So really, judges could choose to protect bitcoin or not, but either way, they will still have some value.  Conversely, they could try to enforce copyright law or not, but there will still be file sharing/copyright infringement either way.  Law may encourage behavior one way or another, but it can't destroy bitcoin or make IP bulletproof.  What this means for the morality of it is:  If full, global, complete Intellectual property is necessary for any particular idea to emerge, it won't emerge.  If partial or significant IP is required, such ideas may emerge in the US or Europe, under favorable conditions.  Other ideas/information may appear spontaneously, so we don't have to worry about them.
Before I we draw conclusions about the morality of IP, we have to recognize the kind of trade off that IP is.  IP encourages more innovators, it promotes musicians, programmers, filmmakers, etc. at a small cost to everyone else.  What is the value of all their work?  How much of it is important?  Would it appear in the absence of IP, and if so, in what form?  Does IP prevent any innovation from being created?  What are the costs of enforcing IP?  All things considered, are the innovations that result from IP worth price?  These are the questions that society must answer, and I cannot answer them alone.

Wow, that was an interesting read.  I'm no economist, I have no training in economics, but I skimmed through it and focused on what I could understand.
The paper makes a few points.  First: a discussion of currencies in general:  They are valuable because they are exchangable.  There is a cost of using any currency, but bitcoins are expensive in a very different way.  (In that you need to do a lot of interwebing to get your hands on them.)  Conclusion 1: the demand for bitcoin is limited by the number of people who could easily learn about them, how to get them, and how to handle them.
It goes on to talk about supply and demand.  Noting that the supply is known by everyone in advance, the price becomes the sole measure necessary for demand.  They looked at the MtGoxUSD price and the Volume in dollars, applied some fancy schmancy statistical analysis, and concluded that the market for bitcoin has some weird properties that are not seen in ordinary financial markets.
They segmented the data set at the July 2011 peak, and tried again.  They found something interesting:  Before the crash, the price responded POSITIVELY to volatility, whereas normally prices go down in response to volatility.  They found that every signal, pretty much, made the price go up, ad infinitum, or should I say, $29.  After the crash, the market changed its behavior:  Traders who were intolerant of risk left the market, and everyone else who was left responded to price shocks more rationally.
Now, the authors conclude, when the price jumps up, people sell and bring it down.  If the price falls, people are more inclined to buy it back up.  Now, volatility pushes the price down, and stability is pushing it up.
So yeah.  We've wised up.

I think these problems are serious and relevant.  However, I'm optimistic that solutions will emerge.  The security of e-walletss will come with time, trust and prestige.  Mt. Gox seems to be making the most headway in this direction.  The simple how to information is also a problem, but in the same way solutions will come from Mt. Gox and other bitcoin exchanges.  The public face issue is the same deal.
However, I think that buying bitcoins is as difficult as it is for a good reason: money is tightly controlled all over the world.  In most places international trade is highly restricted, and money crosses borders only to and from large, well established, highly regulated institutions.  If there were no regulation of this sort, of the few things woe could be sure, it would be a whole lot easier to buy bitcoins.
Even so, I'm optimistic about even this.  The bitcoin economy has been highly resilient to downturns in it's short history, and I think is pretty sure to grow long term.  As the trading volume of bitcoin goes up, more and more local exchange will become feasible.  It may be possible to set up an exchange within a country that does no international trading and thus avoids all these laws.  Technologies such as craigslist should keep bitcoin alive in reigons where internal trade is sufficiently suppressed, but there's no way they would restrain trade that much globally.  Bitcoin will always be easy to use *somewhere*.

False.  The supply and demand schedule of any good or service clears when the quantity supplied equals quantity demand.  The market price may fall to any rational number.  Every price is a signal to producers and consumers.  If market exchange is not possible, market exchange is not a solution.


False.  Money is a medium of exchange.  for it to emerge from a market economy, it must have pre-existing value.  Paper can never be money in a market economy.  Only truly scarce things can be money in a market-based economy.


This is why things like paper can never be money.  Printing a design on a piece of paper is not creating any value.  Writing down "1 hour of labor" on a note does not represent value, it represents debt.  Only scarce commodities that people value, not tied to any redemption of value in the future, can be money.

Wow, that must have been really cool.  Explaining an information-based system is always funny, and most 5th graders probably aren't using computers or at least don't fully understand them yet.  If you can fully explain something to a 5 or 10 year old, then you really understand it.  If it was as fun as it sounds like it was, it goes to show how much there is to learn and know about it.
I'm sure these kids will see bitcoin again.  Obviously improvements will be made in the future, and some of the details will be forgotten, but inspiring young people can have more profound effects on the utilization of any technology than convincing everyone to use it today, because there is still a lot of development to do.  But igniting a creative vision for that development in the eyes of people is... well, awesome.

The traditional banking network requires charge-back protection.  I'm almost inclined to say it was designed that way.
To buy something, you MUST give out your credit card information, which can be used to take any amount of money from your account.  If there was no chargeback protection, no one would use traditional banks.  Bitcoins do not have have this problem, since payments are authorized by YOU, signing a statement on the bitcoin network with your private key, which is never seen by the seller.
Obviously, for trade to occur between the two currencies, we at least have to be aware of this.  Maybe a bitcoin exchange will let you buy and sell bitcoins but won't let you withdraw your bitcoins until the funds are cleared or something.  Just make sure they work something out so this doesn't happen again.
@_date: 2012-05-11 09:27:08
Technically it can be done, no problem.  Financial market regulation is the primary obstacle.  Also, the bitcoin economy isn't very big yet.  I think it will most likely take a few years for the global bitcoin economy to grow big enough to be worth modifying the financial infrastructure.
@_date: 2012-11-20 21:47:35
I think the word you are looking for is "oligopoly" and yes, it is there.
The point I'm making is Bitcoin solves all of these problems.  It's completely decentralized; no one has any way of controlling it, and it allows people to send money anywhere.
If we pass a bunch of regulations that forbid banks from blocking payments to certain entities like wikileaks, it will create a false sense of security.  It will probably never be enforced, especially when you're dealing with an organization that the Dept. of State has called a terrorist group.  Washington has more bargaining power than any other organization on the planet, and will prevent such regulations from being enforced to protect its own interests by any means necessary.
That's why we need payment networks that do not rely on government authority.  Bitcoin is the perfect example of course, but it also means having less regulation of banks.  If banks are liable to follow millions of rules no one ever has time to read, but it helps defend various government interests, regulations are far less likely to be used against it.  Banks that allow people money to be used for things like wikileaks can be arrested on all kinds of BS charges and never see the light of day again.  This incentive promotes defending government interest at the expense of free speech, which is exactly what the proposed regulations have the intention of solving.

The ability to spend bitcoins is in the wallet.dat file.  But making a copy is not theft.  If you have the wallet.dat and a computer, you can send or transfer the bitcoins to any address or make up a new one and send them to that.  This would be theft.
If you copy their wallet.dat, they might well spend the bitcoins first.  So whoever tried to spend them 2nd would be out of luck.

What rules do you speak of?  Banking regulation is at an all time high now.  International payments are scrutinized like hell by various government agencies, and the only reason they dropped payments to wikileaks is because they were beholden to too much regulation.  They need so many different agencies permissions to just do any kind of basic business, they could risk their entire enterprise by pissing off one government employee.  Ever heard of 3 felonies a day?  The finding that the average person could be thrown in jail for everyday activities?  Imagine 300 felonies a day.  Think about it.
The fact that the government has so much power over banks is exactly why they cut payments to wikileaks.  Things like Federal reserve bailouts and other bs is exactly what government agencies don't want people to hear about.  We need strong, independent banks who are not beholden to all these alphabet soup agencies, nor responsible for the stuff people do with their money.  If Washington and Brussels won't allow that, then people should know about it so they can switch to more sound money.

Not a central server.  The software is open source, so anyone can run an electrum server.  The electrum client simply looks for electrum servers, and if none are available, you could host one yourself.  At any given time, several of them are usually online.  All it does is ask for the balance on your bitcoin address, and the electrum servers help distribute your signed transaction statement when you send coins.  No private information is ever exchanged.
@_date: 2012-11-20 16:35:53
I don't think this regulation is necessary.  In fact, it may be counter-productive.  Just because we shouldn't be beholden to banking interests doesn't mean we have a right to tell them how to run their business.
If they want to restrict certain payments on their networks, they have a right to do that.  It's their network.

You see, all those bitcoin advantages/fiat disadvantages are related to scale.  If you have only two people trading with each other, all these intermediates are expensive and unnecessary.  Bitcoin solves a lot of problems.  but without bitcoin, bureaucracies were needed to solve these problems, albeit imperfectly.  It is possible to have a functional fiat monetary system that can keep millions of accounts accurately and relatively safe from theft or fraud with and ONLY with large numbers of people working in the banking industry.  Having all these banks already built up and organized, their unit cost is now low.  The banking markets have evolved specifically to address these problems at the lowest possible cost.  Because of the huge scale of the national fiat markets, these economies of scale are more powerful than many of us realize.
I'm not saying bitcoin doesn't have advantages, I'm saying we need to avoid soley focusing on its advantages and understand, too, that it is a complex trade-off that is not universally accepted yet.  Ultimately, people will choose how they bank based on unit costs, of one form or another. The bitcoin banking industry will one day have even lower unit costs, but like the fiat banking industry, it will not be built in a day.

I'm kind of thinking out loud here... but having governments and financial institutions benefit from inflation does have the upside that it's possible for them to function without charging people for all of the costs of operating.  Like, it's possible to have a bank account with no fees because the bank is making money on the depreciation of your savings and interest on loans.  At the very least, your money is kept safe and they at least operate the credit card system/bank transfers/etc, and the government can at least act as a lender of last resort/do other things without necessarily having the money to pay for them.
If I were in charge, 2% inflation is too much, but with maybe 1% or 0.5% it's arguably a reasonable cost for the proper operation of these things.

As a bitcoin enthusiast, I think now is too early to push for actual business adoption, and here's why:
Bitcoin's value proposition is as a currency.  However, no currency is useful unless its value is stable.  When people trade a currency every day to buy things, the currency needs a buffer to stabilize its value.  For the dollar it's the banking system, including the fed and other banks, via monetary base adjustments and fractional reserve.  With bitcoin, however, no central banking is allowed, so buffering bitcoin must mean buying and selling to counteract the price movements that would otherwise form from daily exchange, or simply investing so much money in it to make any such price change insignificant.  Fractional reserve may also play a role in the long run as well, who knows.
In either case, massive investment is required to support sustained business activity.  You could say that "merchants can just use coinbase/bitpay" but the volatility affects customers too: I would be hard pressed to spend any of my bitcoin at the rate it is appreciating, because if I buy some today and spend the same amount on stuff, by the time the bitcoins are available, they are worth 30% more at least.
My point is that you have to separate bitcoin as an investment from bitcoin as a payment system.  Bitcoin is suitable for some businesses, and I think as time goes on more and more will find it suitable.  But don't go telling everyone they should use it: that would be dishonest.  We are still in the very early years.

If you want the bitcoins fast, [Bitinstant]( is a well established exchange that has been praised by other community members (although I have never bought from them).  They accept a few different payment methods, but their most useful is cash at a bank/wal-mart or something.  You can get your coins in about an hour in total, and their fees are around 4%.
If you're willing to wait a few days, I would recommend [Coinbase]( for buying or selling bitcoins (I am a happy customer).  They only accept bank transfers, which are slower but cheaper.  It could take anywhere from 4 to 7 days total, and their fee is around 1%.
Unfortunately, neither of these exchanges accept paypal, because accepting paypal for bitcoins is risky.  When selling stuff on paypal, the seller is responsible for proving that they sent the product to the customer.  With bitcoins, that's impossible, so if the customer initiates a chargeback, the seller loses both the money and the bitcoins.

There are two complimentary explanations for the value of bitcoin: The network effect, and Mises' regression theorem.
**Network Effect:** (why bitcoin and not "byte"coin)
More likely than not, you have a facebook account, just because everyone else has a facebook account, even if you don't like it. Why? The fact that other people use THAT social network vs any other social network is part of its value. If facebook sold cloud computing services, it wouldn't matter who else used it, but people value social networks that their friends are a part of. In the same way, the bitcoin economy has developed into a small but functional economy. Numerous businesses are using bitcoin and many more are being built as we speak. If you created a cryptocurrency called bytecoin, no one would use it, because it would be just like bitcoin, only without the economy. It would be like creating a new facebook with no users. No one would use it. We know this because there are several alternative versions of bitcoin that you've probablly never heard of.
**Mises's Regression Theorem:** (why any crypto currencies have value at all)
In his book Human Action, Mises determined that media of exchange can mantain a hign exchange value without any other practical use value through a very interesting process: That the value of a media of exchange today is not based soley on what it can buy today but what it could buy yesterday. As a result, the value of such currencies can change over time. How do they do this? At first, there must exist currencies that have use value. Grain, cattle, or anything else can be used as money. Even sea shells would work. However, over time, their exchange value can drive up demand, which can lower prices the next day and cause the value of the cattle or wheat to be traded for far more than their use value. So even people who think sea shells, or thos vegitarians who don't eat cows,are trading with the new currency, even though they disagreed with the initial value (because value is subjective.) What's important is that there was initial value, not everyone agreed, but not everyone has to, and future changes in supply and demand can alter future prices.
How does this apply to bitcoin? Well clearly bitcoin never had any direct use value. But if you think about it, you realize that bitcoin has a huge use-value: as an investment. Everyone can see that bitcoin has all the essential properties of money, but it's not a universal currency yet. But could be. That is the initial value. Some people wanted to buy some, others thought those people were crazy. regardless of who was right, this initial value seeded price information to markets, and trade became possible. Once trade is possible, it doesn't need to maintain a use value any more than gold, because yesterday's prices (in BTC) determine today's demand. For the bitcoin economy to survive, it must simply be more favorable (in the long run) to transact with bitcoin than fiat currencies for some types of trade.

If you make up a key in secret, it's not a part of the public record until coins are sent to it.  The public record contains all addresses that now have or ever did have coins, such a private offline key would show up when BTC are first sent to it.  until then, the BTC are sitting in the senders account.

A bit is a unit of information: it is the answer to a yes/no question.  We measure information by asking how many yes/no questions would you have to ask to figure it out.  If there are 8 possibilities, you would need to ask 3 yes/no questions.  If there are 16 possibilities, 4 yes/no questions.  For every number of possibilities, there is some number of yes/no questions needed to specify any single one: that is the number of bits.
If you only look at words 8 characters or longer, you would need to ask about 20 yes/no questions to specify an English word, so the set of English words with 8+ chars has 20 bits.  If you have 20 words, the total entropy is 400 bits.  So 20 words is more than you need.  As I said above, 80 bits should be good, 100 bits is better, 120 bits or more is overkill.  So (100 bits) divided by (20 bits per word) is about 5 words, so you need at least 5 random words 8 chars or longer, on average (depending on how long they are) to secure a bitcoin address.
If you use words from different languages, then the only way to guess it would be to consider all possible words in all major languages, so each word would have more bits, depending on how many languages your attacker searches.  So if there are 2 languages, add 1 bit to every word, if there are 16 languages, add 4 bits to every word.

Here's what the guy DOESN'T tell you:  The money supply is related to US Government spending by the bond market.  So for every dollar or two that it taxes, it needs to go to the bond market for another.  A huge chunk of the money on the bond market is from the federal reserve, which itself is a creation of Congress, although it is managed by the member banks.  The Federal Reserve will always loan the federal government whatever amount it needs to pay its bills, no matter what.  So federal spending, effectively, increases the money supply.

Security vulnerabilities for iphone and android are discovered from time to time.  They're easier to exploit on android.  Although Google and Apple are getting better about security, to protect your coins from theft, do two out of three:
1. Never download questionable apps, never open potentially malicious files.
2. HEAVILY ENCRYPT your wallet (most bitcoin apps' built in encryption is good)
3. Limit your phone's balance to $200 worth or so.
It goes without saying that you should protect yourself from loss with backups, either off-line or heavily encrypted in the cloud (or both).

I don't know why that would be necessary.  Bitcoin is open source, and the network is designed so that no one can control it.
If the bitcoin developers aren't doing their jobs, anyone else can develop bitcoin software, and users/merchants can donate to these new developers.
On the contrary, a robust cryptocurrency economy would have one blockchain, one network, and only one reference implementation.  This produces the maximum visibility for any attack, the maximum cost for a 51% attack, maximum security for the network, the most secure and stable exchange rates, and allows market participants to price their goods without constantly checking the exchange rates.
However, you point out the value of alt chains and coins for testing and experimentation.  I totally agree with that.  They could be private credits.  But the idea of alt coins as money, to replace bitcoin, to me, is like hoarding platinum or palladium, hoping everyone will start using them to trade with.

With bitcoin, there is a public record of every account.  Everybody can see the public record.  [Here is an example.](  You don't need to be online to *receive* money, you only need to (eventually) be online to *send* money.
There are a few ways of making a paper wallet, but in the end it's just a way of storing the private key that lets you send BTC out of a wallet.  Because different clients store information differently, it will depend on the client.
The easiest way to create a paper wallet is the blockchain.info oflline wallet tool.  You literally just go to [blockchain.info]( create a wallet (the link at the top right), click on the import/export tab (2nd set of tabs, near the top of the site, far right), then click "paper wallet" link on the left side (bottom of the list.)  You can print that out.
Another easy way to do it is to use [Electrum](  When you download it and create a wallet, you will be able to store the private key as usual but you will also get a 12 word phrase or something.  You could literally write that 12 word phrase down, store it anywhere you want, and go to any other random computer and type into an electrum client and you'll get access to your coins.

It's not just a remote risk of loss: it's giving money away for free.
Credit card companies put the burden of proof on the seller in any dispute.  If the seller sells something and doesn't have evidence of delivery, if the buyer initiates a charge back, the buyer gets the money back, regardless of what was sent.  If you sell bitcoins for credit, people will send you credit, you will send away coins, they will charge you back, and you will have nothing.

Yes I understand how it works: a secret seed is combined with a time stamp in a cryptographic hash function to produce a pseudo random digest ("one time password") that proves ownership of the seed without revealing it, so it can be sent over an insecure channel.
The problem with Google's authenticator is not in its standard behavior, but with the fact that it is installed via the google play store, Google has direct access to the APIs required to push updates to the app.  So if Google, for any reason, wants the keys in your authenticator, they could not only access your Google account, but to any other account or service that uses it for 2 factor authentication.  This is particularly a concern if you work for a company that competes with Google and your authenticator is protecting trade secrets, or if you have some data that you don't want Google to be able to access.  Because by default, right now, Google knows everything about you if you use Android.

Why do you have an iphone?  Apple hates freedom. /s
To answer your question, [blockchain.info]( is the way to go.  The reason is because its impossible to verify the source for an iphone app, so the developer has to be trustworthy.  There have been a few wallets made for the iphone, but blockchain.info has handled thousands of dollars worth of my own coin and those of my friends and family perfectly, every time, on every device.  I suspect more people use their wallet than any other, and in the 3 years I've been following bitcoin, I've only heard of maybe one possible problem (that I think was resolved) out of ~100k likely users.
Blockchain.info also has nice security features and import/export, so you can use funds from another wallet without doing a bitcoin transaction, and you can take them out again similarly.

I think your advice would apply if gains were more extreme, but most of use haven't put our life savings into bitcoin.  We aren't seeing $100k's appear out of nowhere.
Even if we were, the "typical bitcoin user" (IMO) is not the kind of person whom I imagine would blow all the money once it showed up on the charts.  I myself have only sold what I really needed and tried to steadily grow my balance over time.  While the price will be volatile for a long time, the market simply cannot sustain growth at the speeds it was growing in the previous bursts.  Each burst always cracks.  The net effect of actually winning a lottery, thus, only appears after holding and defending a bitcoin balance for many years or more.  If you were no good at managing money in the first place, winning a lottery can cause some disruption, but I just can't see that kind of person part with all the cash they would need to get started, and continually hold such a risky asset for long enough.

in 1933, the government offered $35/oz.  If they had offered nothing, what would have happened?  it would have been smuggled out and little gold would be recovered.
The same would be true for bitcoin.  If they offer $15 for each one and demand everyone turn them in, some would get turned in, some would be smuggled overseas.  If they offer nothing, people will just keep them in secure wallets either offline or offshore.  The value would drop, but the linked article even admits that gold was still traded on black markets after gold was criminalized.

I want you to consider the following attack:
A thief finds the paper wallet when the user is not present, and opens it.  The attacker then scans the public and private keys, and prints another identical copy, by photo-shopping the scanned keys into a new similarly generated paper wallet.  He even hand-writes (copies) notes written on the old (ripped) wallet, so when he's done, there's another identical paper wallet and the attacker has the private key on his phone or something.  The attacker goes on to spend the funds and the user never knows until months later.

What I say when people ask me about it is this:
"To understand bitcoin, you need to know that it's not just one thing, it's actually four: It's first and foremost a computer program, that anyone can download, modify, or run.  Second, it's a computer network.  Anyone who wants to join the network may.  But they talk to each other in a very specific way.  Third, bitcoin is a protocol, just like the English language is a protocol, or like HTTP is a protocol.  A few specific statements are defined, such as send transaction, ask for a list of transactions, etc.  Finally, bitcoin is a currency.  This is because the bitcoin network is constantly relaying lists of transactions that show who owns what coins.  People are not buying any material coin or bill of credit from an institution, they are buying a fraction of credit on the list of people who own bitcoins."

Doing it offline is not optimal, bitcoin is designed to work online.  Basically:  all you need is for the receiver to generate a public key, communicate the public key to the payer, and the payer needs the internet to finish the job.
If the payee trusts the payer, he could create a private key, which could be done without a computer (just 256 random bits, just roll some die a few times or something) which the payer would have to go to a computer, use a client to determine the public key for the random bits they made up in secret, and send the coins that way.
In short: it's best if both parties are online, but the sender MUST be online to execute the payment, and the receiver MUST create and communicate the address to the sender first.

Honestly, I don't think they're out of cash.  They deal with more money than all the other exchanges put together, and the other exchanges are making a healthy profit.  The extreme growth is probably just putting a huge strain on the banks they deal with, who are struggling to keep up with demand while ensuring every cent that is sent is not laundered.  I'm sure that as growth slows and their prices line up with their competitors (or vice versa) these issues will taper out.  But I could be wrong.

While it's easy to move coins anywhere around the internet, The reason the prices on exchanges are differnet is because transferring fiat money from one exchange to another is hard.
Each exchange accepts different payment methods (or at least the optimum methods are different) and people who use one payment method over others tend to, on average, deviate from the market collectiveley just enough to cause an imbalance on the exchange they use.

Could it be a statistical fluke?  If so, it really should confirm any time now, and the millions of other transactions just confirmed sooner, and you were the 0.00001% that had to wait a day.
I do know that right now, miners are going through the voluntary 250 ~~kg~~ kb block limit, and that is causing some issues with some miners not willing to publish blocks larger than 250kb.  If you look at the [block size charts]( you can see that while there is significant variation, average block sizes are going over this number, and a few transactions are taking longer.
Obviously, there's not a lot you or anyone can do about the transaction.  I think it should confirm soon, but this is definitely something the developers need to investigate and make sure that transactions don't take this long again.

The only things that are closed are the internal operations of the relevant companies, which arguably has nothing to do with the currency.

No one will ever know for sure unless or until it happens.  It's the ultimate numbers game:  there are 2^160 possible bitcoin addresses, and any public piece of information smaller than that is a target, especially if your seed has at less than 40 bits of information.  Over 60 bits you should be fine.  From 40 to 60 is "probably" safe.
Remember, this is the amount of entropy is not in the seed itself, but the information required to specify the seed.  If my seed was the first 1000 digits of pi, the entropy is not thousands of bits, but only log2(1000) (about 10 bits) or so plus whatever to specify pi and the encoding, so perhaps 15 or 20 bits, crackable by a botnet in minutes.  To specify a line in any book, website, dictionary, etc, you need to consider the total number of possible websites or words and take the log2 of that number.  For combinations of such items, add the entropies.  If the answer is under 40, your coins will be stolen.

Here's why I think you're wrong:  Bitcoin is volatile, always has, and will stay volatile for as long as it takes.
Bitcoin is currently in it's first stage of life.  We all know that bitcoin has the potential to replace all other currencies, but won't any time soon.  It will take time for bitcoin to improve and become easier to use, and more importantly: be easily convertible to and from other, more stable currencies.  Businesses will never be able to account for things in terms of bitcoin until it stabilizes, because if enough did, it would drive up demand which would introduce new volatility.
Over time, this will cause bitcoins to go up, down, up down again, as investors come and go.  Lots of people will make money, but almost as many will loose.  Eventually, it will reach a decision point: when investors everywhere will see what it is, enough data will be available to calculate its true value, it will quickly rise to that value, and stay there.  This will be the second grand stage of bitcoin, and during this second stage, it will be gradually adopted by average people everywhere.  Banks and other investors will effectively control the bitcoin supply by buying and selling it in accordance with changes in adoption, but by this point, it is a matter of time before bitcoin is used everywhere, and investors know this, so they trade so much bitcoin value that they make enough to operate on tiny margins.
I think this is a much more realistic scenario.  Businesses, especially banks, are slow to change, and people don't just change their currency without either massive government support or massive amounts of time for adjustment.  I think if governments forcefully imposed an adoption that the economy was not prepared to handle, then there would be serious problems, but I think that the amount of time it will take to fully monetize bitcoin will make such a scenario irrelevant; people will be able to see it coming from a mile away, and the rate of effective inflation people will see in government currencies induced by such a transfer will be comparable to the inflation people are dealing with today.

If a transaction was sent but never confirmed in a block, then the coins are still spendable from the original address.
Your client might not let you spend them since it remembers sending the transaction, but if you make a new transaction with a fee from the same address, it will confirm soon and your old transaction will discarded.  So you might need to export your private key or reinstall your client or something.

Running your own full bitcoin node vs running a lit client doesn't do much for your own security.  With a lite client, you save a lot of bandwidth, disk space and processing power, but it's possible for the server you connect to to lie about how much coin you have.
Each additional node adds to the security of the network overall, but each adds less than the last.  For instance, I run electrum on my desktop, but if I was worried the server might be lying to me, I can check blockchain.info.  Or I could check blockexplorer.  Or I could import my keys into BTC spinner on my phone, or I could check coinbase (you get the idea).
With all of these options at my disposal, the whole "They could lie to you" attack would be damn near impossible to successfully pull off.

It depends on how long those coins have been sitting at their current address.  If you've had 0.1BTC since 2009, and you send them with no fee, they'll confirm in the next block.  If you got them 10 minutes ago and you tried to send them for free, miners will outright reject it until they're maybe few months old?  And it would take a while before they confirm in a block.  Double that (a few months) if you're use a change address.  These amounts of time scale inversely with the BTC amount.

It's simply a matter of volume.  The average trade volume between two currencies can be generalized as the product of the value of each currency.  For example if people want to exchange 5 Million dollars and 4 Million Euros, these exchanges will be proportional to the value of each times eachother.  (Since 4 EUR ~  5USD, the are equal, and can be substituted as:  5 Million USD * 5 Million USD = 25 Trillion USD^2 .  Volume can be measured in square dollars, or square Euros, etc.
If people want to exchange JPY for CHF, and the amounts of CHF and JPY are each worth 5,000 USD, then the volume will have a value of 25 million USD^2 , which is one *millionth* of the USD&lt;&gt;EUR trade in our example.  My point: if there are fewer people who want to trade a currency, the exchange market will be much smaller.
Although it has grown, the value of bitcoins that people want to exchange is tiny compared to most other currencies.  Suppose people want to trade 5,000 USD of bitcoins per day.  The exchange market would have a value of 5,000 USD * 5 million USD = 25 billion USD^2 .  This is 0.1% of the USD&lt;&gt;EUR trade.  The picture is even more bleak for trade with other currencies.  Therefore, we would expect (for a 100% fixed cost exchange market) for the unit fees to be 1000 times higher on USD&lt;&gt;BTC trade than on USD&lt;&gt;EUR trade.  Of course, costs are not fixed, and bitcoin is leaps and bounds more efficient than fiat currencies, but it still suffers from limited use.

To be fair, and I still totally agree with you, one reason the metric system hasn't caught on completely in America is because average people almost never need to actually convert units.

The problem is that bitcoin is not well known enough for such a standard to emerge.  For Americans, the dollar is ubiquitous and deeply integrated into society.  (I would guess it's a similar situation situation for any other rich country.)  Our basic language conventions for trading, buying and selling assume the use of dollars by default, as everyone uses them to buy pretty much anything.  People can afford to say 10k in the context of money and immediately understood, because our culture, institutions and experiences are adapted to trade and valuation of things in terms of dollars.  Bitcoins, on the other hand, are extremely rare and esoteric.  In other words, you simply need more information to specify them.  No single or double-syllable word is avalable to describe them, much less their specific subdivisions.
In light of this, I think the best notation would be: "10 m฿" or if the ฿ character is unavailable: "10 mBTC" 
It's clear, unambiguous, can be pronounced formally or informally, and employs syntax that people already understand.  Yeah it takes a few more syllables, but for now, those syllables are necessary.  I think that messing around with slashes through the letter m is just an unnecessary typography problem that will cause more confusion than its worth.

However, no one has the right to destroy bitcoin, no one can buy up the open source software and kill it, no one can hijack the network or the business that support it.

I have an idea on how this could possibly be implemented without using a third party service, but the bitcoin protocol may have to be extended.
Consider this: miners accept new transaction because of mining fees and for the block reward.  There are only so many transactions that pay fees and they need to eventually process the unpaid ones as well, so they are marginally motivated to accept each transaction.  But what if you offered them a deal:
"Hey.  I see there's this transaction in the unprocessed transactions list.  If you refuse to process that transaction and accept this new one in its place, I'll pay you several times the fee."
Censorship-resistance is a key value of bitcoin, and a feature like this would enable censorship.  So we have to have a rule to keep people from locking up money forever: If you want to block a transaction, you must send the same funds away from the same bitcoin address with a signed transaction of your own.  That way, you could have a computer at home (or rent services from a 3rd party provider, your choice) to monitor the bitcoin network for unauthorized transaction from any bitcoin addresses you control.  If any such transactions are spotted, the monitor will send a bounty message to any and all miners who will accept this bounty, along with a signed transaction that removes the bitcoin from the original address and puts them somewhere safe.  That way, an attacker who tries to steal bitcoin can't do it, but no transaction needs to happen until it appears in the queue.
Potential problems: the attacker will be willing to pay a large transaction fee.  If the attacker's fee is greater than (or at least not too much smaller than) the redirect-bounty, the attacker will escape with the coins, so if you create a bot that scans for transactions and makes offers to miners to redirect funds being stolen, you might need to offer large amounts to the miner in fees.  In fact, considering the attacker will be willing to accept anything once he has the private key, he might send the coins to himself with a tx fee equal to 50% of the value, or 99% of the value, at which point the scheme falls apart, unless the attacker knows nothing about it.
If a redirect-bounty system could be set-up and the existence of bots that scan for specific transactions is kept hidden from attackers, then this could potentially be a game changer in bitcoin wallet security.

So much for showing me the FAQ.  However, now they have my name, a Username, my email, and a password, which could be used to guess login info on other sites.  It won't work, but why risk it?

Bitcoins are infinitely divisible (with client modifications).  So if you buy 90% of the bitcoin, all the trade that was happening before will now happen just the same at 10x the price, so you'll have to spend the same amount of money to reduce the money supply by a factor of 10 every time.  Because the divisibility of bitcoins could be arbitrarily enhanced and they are over the long term infinitely divisible, such an attack would effectively require and infinite amount of money to execute.

What exactly are you trying to communicate to your chapter?  There are different ways and means of using bitcoin (as an investment, to buy drugs, to trade internationally, to study cryptography, or to fund volunteers) and different considerations for each use.  I feel like this document has information on everything, and most of it isn't useful for your purposes.
* If you want your chapter to use bitcoin to solicit donations from the interwebs, talk about marketing to the average bitcoin user.  Everything else is bitpay.
* If you want to use bitcoin for moving funds internally, talk about managing bank accounts, accounting, or bitcoin security.  And of course bitpay or whoever else you guys use.
* If you want volunteers on the ground to use bitcoin, talk about partnering with merchants and convincing them to accept bitcoin so they can deal with selling the stuff, and your volunteers can just pay them.
As for investment, you can talk to anyone about that, and I would agree that bitcoin is a good investment, but I don't think that your group's meeting time is served well by that kind of discussion.  Same with buying drugs or for cryptanalysis.
Remember, bitcoin is simply and complexly money.  Money has been studied and considered by academia for centuries, and there are still things that we have trouble with.  It's potential uses and ramifications are infinitely complex, but for using it on the street, none of that matters: I get money for serving others, and others take it when they serve me.  It's that simple.

Most currencies have been around (or their predecessors have been around) for hundreds of years.
More importantly, the inability for some script kiddie to instantly steal the entire money supply of a currency is necessary but not sufficient for it to qualify as "rock solid."  Money simply isn't useful if it's value isn't stable.  There are two sides to every transaction, so the direction of the change, regardless of weather it hurts buyers or sellers, hurts its stability and therefore its usefulness.

There is some truth to this: banks have refused to do business with all but four US Bitcoin companies that I'm aware of (bitpay, coinbase, campbx, anf gyft).  All of these business are following strict AML guidelines and most have state level money service business licenses.  Previous businesses have either been rejected outright or banks unilaterally closed their accounts after they realized what bitcoin is and how uncertain and new it is.  In fact, some of these bitcoin companies I mentioned are not even allowed to say who their bank is, and none of the banks are talking.
Remember that since bitcoin is independent of the US financial system, most of the additional value is lost once you try to interface with banks and exchanges, all of whom are providing a costly service.  It would be great if everyone just did everything entirely with bitcoin, but that's not possible because bitcoin is only useful as a currency if the value is stable, and it can only be used widely if it is valuable enough for everyone to use it.
It's a catch-22.  The only stable solution is either people invest boatloads of money into something that no one uses for a long time until people start using it, or it dies off.

They can only lower prices if they either have millions of dollars of bitcoin or if most bitcoin owners think the sky is falling when the exchanges are under attack.  Such fools (and I know many of them personally) have already sold their coins.
The ability to temporarily spike the price upwards is possible for anyone with millions of dollars, but 1. That's not a risk for a saver and 2. It would be a huge loss to try to pump and dump the market like that, especially with millions of dollars.

One one level, the issue is moot: the VPN can see your home IP address.  If your VPN wanted shit on you and had actionable evidence for a court, it could in theory subpena your ISP to produce your identity.  If you pay with bitcoins, this would be the only way for anyone to determine your identity.  So while bitcoin over PP/CC does help, it doesn't fundamentally change the fact that it is only more difficult, but not impossible, to identify you.

I think this has a lot of potential, but here's the catch: you are competing with craigslist and ebay.  Both of these two sites have an enourmous network effect and to overcome that you'll need more than an improvement over their service.  The Nash equilibrium is an amazing idea but for it to overcome existing marketplaces, I think you may want to hire a business administrator and get a loan.  Continue to work as a developer to create public interfaces, improve the site, create localizations and regional markets. and hire a marketing director.  Have the marketing director write stories, press releases, etc. for developments related to the site, as well as speak with journalists and news anchors about the new marketplace.
I'll say it again: the exchange needs to be dead simple to use.  Meaning: try to remove as much explanation as possible, forget the bomb in the box explanation, and simply remove every word or sentence that the average user sees that is not necessary for the transaction.  Ie: "to order an item, you must deposit double it's price."  Only when the users start asking questions should you link to an explanation, and use the most limited explanation possible that correctly describes the nash equilibrium.  To go along with this point, the user should feel good about every action he/she takes, so say stuff like congratulations! after each step of the process, and instruct the user unambigiously what happens next, with consistently rendered artistic depictions or something. The user should feel like they are in control, so put links that go all around the site on every page.  And finally, the exchange should prompt the user to share it with their friends.  Find ways of asking them to see if anyone has anything they want to buy or sell.  Show the users stories of other people using the exchange.  Consider making a facebook app.  Above all, ENGAGE every trader.
Most importantly: get the word out to everyone you know about this new exchange.  This goes to everyone!

If you don't audit the source yourself and don't build them from a trusted compiler, they're both equally insecure, which is to say they're fine for anything less than $10,000.  That's how much trust I have in the developers of both applications.
Electrum is a client application, so any insecurity would need to be in the source, and would be immediately detectable, so its unlikely to steal your bitcoins.  However, most people just run the binaries, so if something were thrown in there it would be harder to detect, and a mass theft could theoretically be possible (until someone tries to compile it themselves and gets a different hash).
Blockchain.info is more complicated: It is a digitally signed web client (written in javascript or if you're on the iphone, Objective-C) that can be downloaded and run without connecting to blockchain.info.  However, as above, most people simply point their browser at the site and don't look at the code, so if someone happened to go to the site and manually inspect the html/javascript files directly from their browser's cache and audited them (or compared them with the published source), it would be possible to detect any suspicious code.  The iphone app is not as easily inspect-able, but could eventually be checked in a similar way. 
While both clients connect to servers to get block headers and to relay transactions, in both cases the servers never have access to the private keys needed to spend the coins.  As long as you trust the developers are not going to hijack their own apps and steal your coins, you're good.  Furthermore, because both apps are open source and easy to inspect, any hijacked version would be easy to identify, and any potentially malicious code could be dealt with quickly (and the developers would never be trusted again).  This is why both are trustworthy.  But if you want 100% security, download the source, inspect it yourself, build it from a trusted compiler, and don't let anyone modify/update it.

@_date: 2013-11-11 22:31:59
The dollar was plenty successful, and while it was being adopted, it's selling point was that it was convertible to gold.  However, redeeming it for gold in practice was never as easy as it is to buy or sell bitcoins now.  We don't need everyday money to be convertible, we need it to be easy to use and stable.
For the money to "work" it needs to be worth about the same from day to day.  Big swings down OR UP make it too risky to actually use as money for long.  Bitcoin's got the ease of use down, it's the stability that is holding it back.
@_date: 2013-05-06 22:07:36
Just wait.  China is pretty much just getting started with bitcoin.  Americans and other westerners have been talking about bitcoin since the 2011 crash, while the Chinese adopting bitcoin now are moreso hearing about it for the first time.
I think bitcoin is actually farther along in terms of adoption in Europe and the Americas *because* they are criticized in the media.  If bitcoin were truly to be ignored by it's critics (or potential critics) as it is in China, it's a sign that it has a longer way to go.

What country do you live in?
If people are recommending you go to a market that works well in their country but poorly or not at all in your country, you're gonna have a bad time.  Except for perhaps Mt. Gox, which has problems of it's own, you should buy bitcoins based on what country you live in, how quickly you need them, weather you want to be fully anonymous, and the methods you can pay with.  Exchanges that work well for others do not necessarily work for you.
One site that catalogs all bitcoin exchanges based on these factors is [Howdoyoubuybitcoins.com](

It's actually quite simple: price volatility reduces it's value as a currency, stability increases it's value as a currency.  So if we want people to use it to buy things, then either everyone needs to buy and sell things at the same time (not gonna happen) or they need to accept price fluctuations as the demand and supply bounce up and down (not acceptable for a world class surrency)  or there needs to be some stabilizing force on the price: hoarding.  This hoarding is what we want to increase, and the rate of hoarding is what we will look at.
The price of dollars is pretty stable because the central bank tends to print a few hundred billion every year, and the value that people want to store in dollars tends to grow by about the same amount.  Today, a few people want to store value in bitcoins, and the money supply does grow to support it, but it's a very disconnected process.  For the price of bitcoin to be stable, the aggregate demand would need to grow logarithmically, but instead, it grows almost randomly.  But we don't need the price to be stable, we just need it to grow slowly and predictably, because it is the fear that your bitcoins could buy less tomorrow that keep most people from buying them now.
Back to your question: what is the optimal rate?  Whatever is most predictable (ie it gets new investors in at a rate that steadily grows the the value of the monetary base while not growing so quickly that a bunch jump in and sell).  This will depend on getting investors on board with the idea of bitcoin being a global currency and building a stable capital base to do so.  To them, predictablity is tied to weather an investment will pay off, so it can't take forever.  But for the investment to be good, it needs to take some time.
After a large enough monetary base has been built with investors' money, then the price of bitcoin will be stable, and people will use it for daily trade.  Once this happens, there will no longer be any uncertainty about bitcoin, and investors will adjust the monetary base accordingly by buying and selling to counteract the business cycles to preserve the value of the bitcoin.  In doing so, the value of the bitcoin will be preserved, and its value will grow in accordance with the growth of the economy as a whole.
@_date: 2013-11-21 20:49:24
I disagree.  I have some bitcoin, but it's value is going up so fast, every time I see a great new offer or something to buy, I take a step back and think "these are **bitcoins** we're talking about here.... in 10 years they could be worth thousands or tens of thousands each!"  I'm already kicking myself over some coins I have donated, spent, or sold over trifling matters.  So I don't spend them.  It think this is rational behaviour, at least for anyone who is buying into the idea for the long haul.
The bit on having a disincentive to hold dollars is true up to a point: I don't keep much in dollars, but for everyday expenses, I always budget to have some, regardless of if I choose to buy that one book through amazon and gyft or not.

It's very simple: The feds do not fear bitcoin, because they simply think that an inflationary fiat money system is superior.  Why else would they get jobs as fiat currency regulators?  If they really believed in hard money, they would be working as gold dealers, commodities traders, or bitcoin developers.  Most of us, conversely, could never imagine working for them.
Every person in every industry is a proponent of his own business.  Everybody gets a career or a job in a field where they feel that they are accomplishing something worth doing.  The fact that they expect bitcoin to remain niche and that we expect it to grow is perfectly natural.

Even before it tops off: It will grow slowly.  The dollar, gold, and other widely accepted stores of value are considered safe, among other reasons, because of their history.  Bitcoin will need to gradually build that history over time.  Yes, in theory, it could take 10% of gold's market share, but only after being around for at least 1% as long as gold has, which would be ~60 years.  And even then, even if it does top off at $50k over the course of 60 years, [that averages out to a 9% annual growth rate.](  Even if you were generous and gave it 30 years, it's still only [20% per year.](

False.  Forget beating him up.  When you meet a stranger from localbitcoins, you have no idea if it's a 13 year old girl or 6 guys with guns.  Play it safe.  Meet at a bank, shopping mall, or anywhere where police will be nearby.  Bring a friend and tell him/her to record the whole exchange with their phone or other camera.  Declare to the camera your name and the trade, and have the other party declare their name and verbally agree.  Better yet, both you and your friend both bring a phone and record it, so its harder for them to try to run off with evidence.  That way if you get scammed/robbed the police have a name or at least a face, and this will deter almost anyone from attempting theft or worse.

When regulators talk, the subject of discussion is law, legal/illegal behaviors, and the legal context of different types of goods and services.  They are not in the business of providing examples.
EDIT: Of course providing examples is useful in their documents and such, but the specific mention of bitcoin has no special significance.

Perhaps, but I'm not a multi-billion dollar government.  I'm just a guy who wants to buy safely.  [People have been scammed before]( and would have been protected if the encounter was recorded, especially if they had the person's name.  I'm not going to report people to the IRS or anything, I just want to have some recourse if someone shows up and strong arms my cash.

Dear CNN,
Stop telling new users to go to Mt. Gox.

I like where this is going:
10^-2 BTC = 1 internet
10^-4 BTC = 1 "intranet"
10^-6 BTC = 1 ???

I looked it up, and the beginning of the graph is early September 2010, and the end is mid July 2013.

Perhaps double check your message conforms to the template?
EDIT It looks like your transaction is gone.  There must have been a glitch.  I just sent you 1mBTC so it's not all bad.

I disagree, because it's not that hard to understand: It's simply a post-national currency with a predictable money supply.  I feel that Ron Paul does a disservice by not analysing it fully.

Whoever is accepting paypal is taking a risk, and has to trust the buyer.  Bitinstant does this I believe, and since bitinstant is trustworthy, it can work.  But this company is brand new.  I'm not sure if I would want any paypal credit from them until they do something to show they are not scammers.

Hate speech is not a crime.  Just because he said something once that was very wrong and offensive doesn't mean we should stop listening to him as a member of the media.  Everyone slips up and says something offensive now and then, especially when you're doing talk radio all day every day.  Lots of people have said far worse and no one is boycotting them.

Bitcoin may be green, but the dollar is greener.  Just look at it.

I remember back in 2010 bitcoins would confirm in minutes, simply because blocks were smaller and the blockchain was lighter.  My guess is if ripple were as big as bitcoin is now, they wouldn't be able to confirm transactions nearly that fast.

I think of it like this: If and when we migrate to IPv6, most of the network switches and computers will need to reprogrammed or replaced, but the websites will still be there.  Similarly, if bitcoin is modified, the miners will need to reprogram or abandon their mining machines, we might need to update our client software, but the value of the bitcoin will still be there.

Ok, so if it's an actual exchange, then it needs to be possible to both deposit and withdraw both BTC and fiat.  How does a piece of PHP allow you to do that?  Bank Credit isn't some open source app you can just port into a web app.

Many people have been scammed with bank deposits.  If you deposit cash anywhere, be careful, and only go with trustworthy vendors with credible reviews.  Otherwise, stick with cash in person.

I highly doubt this fellow is an employee of coinbase, or at least if he is, his profile does not smell like a dead fish bought with paypal.
If he were an employee, he wouldn't have time to be on reddit and/or would promote coinbase more.

It looks like they charge $3 for withdrawing at ATMs, but charge nothing for regular POS purchases.  So they are making something (probablly).

You'd be surprised.  China has changed more in the past 40 years than almost any society in any 40 year stretch, and the government has ~~adopted~~ ad**a**pted more than most governments ever could.  Specifically, china has grown up.  Literacy went from ~20%? to ~80%, there are more college graduates than ever, and China has better access to uncensored foreign news and information than ever before.  Increasingly, the consent of the governed in China is *informed* consent.
While the communist party has done their part by allowing economic growth and not messing it up too much, the consent of the governed is absolutely affected by things like banning bitcoin or other abuses of power.  If ordinary people don't have the right to send magic internet money to their friends freely, then reasonable people will be sick of it, especially if that magic internet money becomes popular/useful elsewhere as well.
