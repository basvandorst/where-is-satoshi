Just ask in or sumthing to get the other sides perspective. 
Personally, I think 11/12k is very cheap if bitcoin reaches 1% of its potential. If it becomes a globally adopted currency for example. It could also crash and burn going to zero. Thats best (kinda) and worst case scenario. Now imagine these two being each side of a spectrum. 
If I were you, I would learn about bitcoin, money, economy ect. When you feel you understand, decide where on the spectrum bitcoin land, and from there you can make a decent decision. Thats kinda what I did at least.
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:49:14
Its still true is hashrate isnt spread out. Its two different attack vectors. High hashrate defends from 1 attack. Decentralization from another. Decentralization doesnt mean much, if bitcoin can just get DDOSed.
Smaller players cant compete because the chineese gov is subsidizing electrical cost of large scale operations. Electricity isnt inherently cheaper for largescale operations or chinamen.

Why wouldnt it. adoption in bitcoin means ppl buying, as in demand?
@_date: 2017-12-10 07:37:21
Totally agreed. Its way too confusing for new ppl getting into bitcoin, understanding how/why another bitcoin exists when they havent even understood what a blockchain is yet.
I like them free coinz ect. and I would prefer future alts getting launched like btg, but brand stealing combined with hashrate competitor, is a but much imo.

Yes its exponential. I was not saying otherwise. Just that the rise this time around is the least steep compared to the other major rises. 
Just go to bitcoinaverage.com and choose to see the logarithmic chart. Most sites has both linear and logarithmic.   
@_date: 2017-12-12 22:12:54
That makes sense to me. He definitely thinks btc derives most of its value from usability (txs). Not from being scarce. 
I dont like him either. The libertarian ideological side of him is pretty offputting to me. Not because of the libertarian part, but ideologue part. But I also find it way more offputting when people demonize others without anything concrete.
Calling it Bcash is fair game and just kinda fun when he freaks out, but the whole "he has armies of shills" ect. is just absurd as long as it isnt accompanied by some proof.
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:24:57
Im sorry to be a party-pooper, but has anyone ever wondered if Andreas didnt want to receive that kind of money, especially in public. For a guy traveling alot, in not first world countries also. Maybe Vers shaming wasnt shaming but pointing to something Andreas didnt want the world to be focused at. Tbh. It does seem a little weird that he wouldnt have a good amount stashed since how long and heavy he has been involved. He was on Joe Rogan in like 2013. Maybe his responses were a akward reflection to Vers pointing, resulting in Andreas having received 1,5 mil based on kinda false (i mean exxarated with deflection purpose) premises. Just a theory, but having watched Andreas for a long time, he doesnt strike me as irresponsible with money and safety. And also as someone who doesnt want others to focus on his wealth. Now I think he dunno wut to do with the money.
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:09:39

I dont like to hate ppl so np. And yea, its a pretty muddy issue. Im just trying to figure out how justified the hate is.
I remember, back when he was still jesus, him (imo) genuinely crying doing an interview of the thought of ridding the world of major wars, by taking financial control from nationstates. 
I might have been wrong about him or he changed since then, but that doesnt seem like the scammy type of person to me tbh.
@_date: 2017-12-13 11:41:59

I mean... bcash is a forked blockchain. Blame ppl instead of going for bch as a whole.
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:55:51
I remember. He vouched for gox having the money, blaming banks for not letting tx go through. That was actually very shady. ty for reminding me.
I kinda have this feeling Ver is more like Gavin than a money hungry scam artist. Unlike Fake Satoshi who I believe is a complete scammer. Maybe its just misplaced respect for OG´s, but I do think the cash-gang is generally motivated by difference of opinion, rather than greed. I might be naive though.
Nevertheless, ty for actually being reasonable. I was afraid, i would be called a shill like last time vaguely defended bcash.
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:17:32
Sounds reasonable. Get your initial investment + a little more just so that you have made some money and then you can play with the rest.
@_date: 2017-12-01 14:43:59
I think we should focus on improving bitcoin instead of tearing down bch. Personally I really dont mind there being succesful alts, created from forking bitcoin. Id rather see more bch, btg, btd ect. than succesful alts started from scratch.

When is futures going up?
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:58:50
1. youre right about cheap electricity in china makes mining centralization there. Why do they mine? to get coinz, and if price wasnt high, less would be mining both in china and everywhere else. Electricity used scales on value. Like i said in the beginning.
2. Is it not only centralizing in china because gov subsidizes it? I dont think using less energy is the only solution. How about US gov also subsidizes? more decentralization since more can compete fairly.
Listen. you can attack bitcoin in two ways. 1: If some entity controls major parts of bitcoin (centralization) and a gov forces them to shut the shit down. 2. Some entity accumulates alot hash and cripples the network with their superior hash-juice.
Having much decentrazation protects from 1. Having high hashrate and therefore energy protects from 2.
Yes, right now those two kinda overlap because of geopolitics, but fundamentally its separate issues. Its important to be able to see the difference. 
Everthing else being equal, more energy used is a good thing for boosting security.
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:03:12
How do we know he is funding misinformation? He himself denies it (Richard Heart interview). Personally he strikes me as a bit fundamentalistic about bch, which can motivate people to do bad things in service of the greater good, but he still shouldnt be blamed without proof or strong indication.
@_date: 2017-12-12 22:42:39
Heres the main difference: house can be taken back by authorities. Decently stashed bitcoin cant. dunno which is better all in all, but if people really max out loans and creditcards to buy crypto en masse.... Things could really get crazy.

Old interview. Price much lower. Ill look into it, but I really wouldnt mind some pointers?
@_date: 2017-12-12 22:01:41
there a difference between creating more coinz and moving the komma. right now btc is divisible into 100.000.000 satoshis. Bitcoin could via HF (im not sure, might only need SF) increase divisibility into for examble 1000x. If we at the same time kept saying 1 btc is 100.000.000, there would be 1000x btc, but not really. Its just an illusion.

They are a Coinbase investor, so it makes sense that they wanna hype bitcoin and by extent CB. He would possibly say it, even if he dont believe.
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:33:55
This is generally not a popular opinion here, but I do not find it unreasonable of Valve and be extension of that, the response in threads like these kinda cultish.
Heres why: Wikipedia stopped accepting DONATIONS from btc. They did a trial period and decided against, like they have with multiple other payment opinions. They also provided a reason; It was confusing to donators, leading to less donations overall. These companies/orgs dont really care either way, they just wanna serve their customers. And they are generally riskadverse.
Steam basically said there was too much trouble because of price-flucturations and fees, but its all rolled up customer experience. 
Now, ive seen theories thrown around that its bch shilling causing this, rendering Valves perceived customer experience problems an illusion.
It also might be true there is some problems. Maybe its a mix of both + a third (and fourth ect.) element. We really dont know.
In any case, what will only make the situation worse, is acting like small children, stomping their feet and demanding they reverse their business decision because "we dont like it". 
What would help instead, could be writing to Valve telling them that you want to spend bitcoin with them and that you hope they consider. Or start buying games somewhere else that does accept bitcoin. 
There is no need to sound the alarms of economic retalition. It wasnt Dimon calling btc a fraud. Its just a company trying to protect its customers and probably their support staff from a (perceived) danger of confusion.
@_date: 2017-12-06 05:40:16
Both i guess
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:06:45
I dont disagree that LN would be nice. And as fast as possible. Imo we just need like 1-5k tx/s (not near VISA), to be home in terms of majority of ppl embracing it. But thats a different issue.
There is different aspects of security/decentralization. There is security in a high hashrate (electricity) in itself because it gets harder to "hack" the network. It also provides some kind of decentralization since its harder for entities to own/control bigger than smaller networks. I do not want to sacrifice any of that security because some treehuggers cry about it.
Then theres china-mining-centralization. Its a completely separate issue from "bitcoin uses too much power per tx" argument you agreed with.
To sum up. You want a strong and decentralized network. Strong in terms of hashrate and therefore electricity and decentralization in terms of "who controls the mining" and nodes, coinz, infrastructure. More than mining matters. I want electrical input of bitcoin to be as much as the value allows it because it adds to security. Its not a problem. It is part of the design.
@_date: 2017-12-12 16:22:58

I do agree that bitcoin is comparable to gold in terms of storing value. Thats more an abstract comparison explaining one the attributes making btc valuable. Gold has different attributes like being pretty and conductive. What the retard did, was taking an abstract comparison and made it into a directly translated 1/1 economic prediction. It is litterally how a little kid would think.

But no, it doesnt do it for me, since I would expect the same behaviour from someone who actually believes blockstream has done a succesful hostile takeover of btc.
I think attributing malice is counterproductive when there isnt strong indications, since it just polarizes the divide further.
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:38:36

Not by 8%. To 8%. You should read "compared to bitcoin" between the lines. 
Even though its a joke and shouldnt be taken seriously, you are still wrong. USD could lose 8% value in a year and you still pay the same. How? If it, in the same timeframe, became 8% cheaper. Money doesnt get more valuable because you can buy better computers each year. Its just that cost of production is getting reduced faster than the money used is losing value. Hope this helps you understand.

@_date: 2017-12-11 15:42:13
It isnt. doing electricity vs transactions is stupid since electricity scales on value. Bitcoins main feature is censorship-resistance. The blockchains breakthrough is decentralization of trust. AKA nobody controls dis shiat. Without that, everything else dont matter. Bitgold could handle way more than 7tx/s, but it was controlled by central entity and could be shut down and was. 
What you call a problem, I call bitcoins MAIN FEATURE. The electricity used on bitcoin is its security. And without security nobody cares about tx/s...

I told the way, but that I was going to the same station, so if he was in doubt he could just follow me. Normal danes would understand this means; watch where im going.

Because they use a payment processor that convert btc to dollar before they recieve any btc. Businesses are not interested in the volatility of hodling. Some might be in the future, but in general they are risk adverse.

Cant predict the future and it seems that releasing locked bch on the market would cause the price to go down. If they open buy side, it might not go down, but I still think it will cause bigger supply than demand. At least short term. Long term GDAX trading bch would be good for BCH.

A country is not a blockchain. Your comparison doesnt apply because there are sooooooooo many differences its absurd to even start naming them.

Analogies are good for explaining and bad for arguing because a soda or a country is not the same as bitcoin. Its not a valid comparison.
Bitcoin has forked in the past. There was for example a hard fork to fix a bug early on, if im not mistaken. The point being, the real bitcoin is the one who people consider as real. Thats it. Nevertheless I prefer btc-scaling to bch, but if bch turns out to be way more succesful than bitcoin, you can expect a moniker change at some point.

bitcoin has more user, developers, existed longer (and therefore been unsuccesfully hacked longer, making it, at least, perceived more secure), better brand recognition ect. easy.
Now imagine if magerpower-pal is actually bitcoin in 10 years when second or third layers are build on top of bitcoin making it cheaper and faster than paypal. magerpower-pal wouldnt be a company, but instead a computer-network like the internet. Do you see no value in owning a part of that potential network?
Transactions arent the only potential btc has. I have used it (mostly as a demonstration) to timestamp a screenshot by "hashing the picture in a transaction" (or something like that). You can use bitcoins blockchain as a immutable ledger which can store documents like stocks, deeds, "moneys". 
Understand that bitcoin or any other crypto is actually the worlds very first decentralized way of doing informational secury. Spread it out, instead of keeping it gated in. Right now they offer a bit of utility (me ordering pizza) and a lot of potential.
@_date: 2017-10-14 22:55:53

Ye... no, I mean historically. Also, how many Germans were arrested last for expressing their political opinion online? In my country that number is zero. Why? Because we know how to manage a nation-state without it turning into a full-on dictatorship. Like how the US also havent, even though they have existed longer than you guys.
@_date: 2017-10-07 16:07:47
Dats nyze... Soon (if not already) your tax-euro will also be spend to make sure to prevent truck-lunatics killing people by mass hitting-them (like in berlin). Theres like.... some quote about sacrificing liberty for safety and the consequences of doing that. If you Germans had been a bit more Libertarian, then maybe you wouldnt have invaded us last time around. Or you could pose the question; what would have happened if the jews were as well armed as the US population? Maybe Germans should wait about a century before you start lecturing others on how to run a nationstate succesfully?
Edit: I would also be curious to who has the highest kill count. Individual gun lunatics in the US. Or gun death perpetrated against citizens by the German government? Pretty sure your government wins, even though the US has existed longer and has more people.
@_date: 2017-10-14 21:39:40
And you dont need 5k to use bitcoin either. Its obvious that you dont understand even the basics of bitcoin, but still you want to use analogies.. Where does paypal get value? they offer a service. the ability for ppl to transact. Does bitcoin offer the same thing? yes it does. Did the tulibs offer that? nope. There is also WAY MORE potential value in bitcoin. Ability for ppl to transact is just 1 example. 
Bitcoin is complex and nobody blames you for not fully understanding it. Most here (including me) doesnt. 
Try answering my question now. Where is the "value proposition" or whatever you wanna call it in the dollar, euro ect? 
Because im totally willing to accept that bitcoin is a scam if we can agree that regular national currencies is a bigger scam.

Sorry if u thought i was trying to be mean to u. Really wasnt my intention. I think youre giving him way to little credit. He is trying to win, which is why he NEEDS to have mass appeal. You need a simple message and MAGA is pretty simple. Thats a statement about modern politics, not just him. 
At the same time, he is saying: "the political system is corrupt", He questions the foreign policy, which states US should be policemen of the world. and he want to audit the fed.
I think he has a lot of substance hidden beneath the surface, because u cant win anything in modern politics by making complicated points.
Edit: and lastly, u called him a napoleonic nightmare, but compared to HIllary he is the Dove. The media has  even pointed this out. So ye, If u think "the devil u know" is better, cool. But, Im not sure he is actually a devil. I just think u should hold on to your reservations until the general is underway. I think, u and many other people will be very surprised at his politics. Especially compared to Hillary. 
Modern politics is a popularity contest. How often does smart and wellformulated nerds win popularity contests? Cant really blame him for doing what it takes to win.

I personally like the idea of UBI. I did a pol.sci paper on it, in regards to Denmark and atm. it is economically viable if you just redistribute our current welfare. It is not politically viable because the left here thinks the unemployed should live "a dignified existence", which means being able buy cigarettes, go to resturants a couple of times each month. Basicly you could do an UBI here in Denmark big enough for a small apartment, internet, electricity/water/gas, cheap food + have about $100 for other things (Denmark is pretty expensive though).
