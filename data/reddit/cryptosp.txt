Ok, thanks....have you tried buying and selling through circle? Is it doable from india?

If he wanted you to believe he was British, he would probably have used those words deliberately.
@_date: 2014-12-25 11:00:27
You must have misunderstood something. I don't think there are any websites who only sell a whole bitcoin. Try circle.com or coinbase.  If you are not a U.S. citizen , you can try localbitcoins.com . You can definitely get fractions of bitcoin there .

Bill Gates didn't get internet either. He once said that internet was 4th or 5th in the list of his priority when internet was on the brink of becoming mainstream.

Well IMHO, the timeline for internet and bitcoin would be a bit different although the attitude of incumbents and the process of market penetration for both the technologies has lots of similarities. In case of internet, there was a requirement of huge underlying infrastructure to be built which took the time. For bitcoin, most of the underlying infrastructure is already built(though we need to make it more efficient). It's the killer apps that will make bitcoin popular and help them go mainstream. I believe that such apps would be built soon and so it shouldn't take 20yrs for bitcoin to go mainstream, it should happen in next 5-10 years.

Well here is my story buddy. When I first learned about bitcoin, I was not able to sleep in the night. I thought how could something this awesome has not gone mainstream yet? I told my "comp engg" friends about it but they totally didn't seem like getting it. When I told my dad about it, here is how our conversation went like-:   
Dad: So who backs it?   
Me: No one.   
Dad: Who invented it?   
Me: No one knows.   
Dad: How does bitcoin look like?   
Me: It has no shape and form.   
Dad: Is it regulated?   
Me: No.   
Dad: Have you gone mad?  
 Me:.........  
And then price hit $1000 and my friends and my father hailed me!!!! The point is "the value" of bitcoin speaks. Now since bitcoin is hovering around 370$ mark , my friends have called me and asked me about buying some cheap bitcoins in the hope of getting high returns and I explained them about all the risks of investing in bitcoins , but most of them are still interested. So buddy you are not lonely , you are probably just a geek like me and geek is the new cool....so cheers!!!!

1)What happens to bitcoin when the margins for these giant and largely centralized mining groups begins to thin?   
- Having invested heavily in bitcoin mining rigs , it makes more sense to keep mining and reduce the losses than to stop mining and not making any returns on those mining rigs.    
2)What's to stop miner conglomerate A from colluding with mining conglomerate B to make a huge short on bitcoin and then threaten the community with a 51% attack and making a fortune when the price collapses?   
- Bitcoin community has successfully slayed such bearwhales making huge shorts in the past . The giant pools have lot of individuals collectively mining with their own mining machines. If they see the two conglomerates are colluding together to do the nasty things , they'll leave their conglomerate pools and join different mining pools preventing those conglomerates from launching 51% attack.

That was a really cool ad. One more step towards taking bitcoin mainstream.

I seriously admire his sincerity towards bitcoin core project. Its people like him who are bolstering legitimacy of bitcoin in the eye of mainstream public.

Thank you James....Just thank you!!!! I had been desperately waiting for your video....Your videos are very informative....Andreas and you are "Bitcoin Gurus"!!!!!
@_date: 2014-11-12 06:28:00
Thank you for being so generous!!!!!
@_date: 2014-11-13 06:06:26
I think we should say 2264.54 bits of "bitcoins". We need to use the word bitcoin until it goes mainstream.

Multiple confirmations are required because if an attacker is trying to generate an alternate chain faster than the honest
chain and if he succeeds he might try to change one of his own transaction. After changing his own transaction, he has to compete with the honest chain and not lose. The probability of an attacker outcompeting drops exponentially as the number of blocks the attacker has to catch up with increases. So if your transaction has only one confirmation, there are chances that an attacker might have double spent the transaction with you and this probability decreases as there are more confirmations.

Lucky you. It went like this with me and my father when I told him about Bitcoin-:  
Dad: So who backs it?  
Me: No one.  
Dad: Who invented it?  
Me: No one knows.  
Dad: How does bitcoin look like?  
Me: It has no shape and form.  
Dad: Is it regulated?  
Me: No.  
Dad: Have you gone mad?  
Me:Just wait and watch.  
But when price surged my father hailed me!!!!

I really want Shahrukh Khan to vouch for bitcoins instead. He has millions of fans around the world and him vouching for bitcoin will help many mainstream people to recognize bitcoins and hopefully adopt it.

Is it just a coincidence that the time she took to interrupt you matches with average block generation time?
@_date: 2014-11-05 03:37:43
You are very notable Andreas. The work you have been doing for bitcoin community is great. You have an ability to explain the mainstream public about bitcoin in very effective way. Your thoughts and philosophies are always intriguing. Cryptocurrencies are here to stay , your reputation is here to stay and so you definitely deserve to be on wikipedia.

Husband: What do you think I am... a Carpenter?  
Next day, when husband came from work, he saw everything has been fixed.  
Husband: Who did all this ?  
Wife: Our neighbour.  
But he gave me two options.....Either I should give him a burger or a kiss.  
Husband: I am sure u must have given him a burger.  
Wife: What do u think I am.......McDonalds

Hi, I am from India. I signed up for circle. At first the 2fa code arrived fast on my mobile. But after the next attempts, I didn't receive 2fa code. Also I didn't get free 10$ bitcoins in my account(presuming that this scheme is still going on).

It was not only about telephone lines buddy. The TCP/IP, which is a protocol of internet and a core part of internet infrastructure, took about 10 years to be implemented on ARPANET. In those 10 years , it went through various phases such as specification phase , testing phase and migration phase.It was only after that when this protocol went into adoption phase.In case of bitcoin , we already have blockchain protocol which is specified , tested and adopted.

One of the killer apps of internet i.e. email was invented in around 1982. Another killer app i.e. the browser was invented in 1990. Yet it took till the year 1999 for internet to have 250 million users. That's 17 years from the invention of first killer app. Bitcoin is just 5yrs old , give it some time.

Andreas is my hero....I am into bitcoin because of his inspirational talks!!!!
@_date: 2014-11-24 09:05:06
Well said. That's exactly what happened in case of internet. Watching this video made me feel like the history is repeating itself.

India does not have pretty severe restrictions on bitcoin. RBI has issued a cautionary notice about bitcoin pretty much asserting to deal with bitcoins by considering all the risks and that notice does not imply ban on bitcoins. India is a vibrant democracy and hence they can not impose an outright ban on bitcoin easily.
@_date: 2015-01-03 15:12:53
More transactions , more merchants, more users , more mining difficulty , more clarity in regulatory environment. IBLT will change the face of bitcoin significantly.

1)Calling Mark Karpeles "MtGox bitcoin chief" doesn't make any sense. It's like calling Mark Zuckerberg the "Facebook tcp/ip chief" 2)In the scrolling title , there is no space to put MtGox before bitcoin and it's "ESS" of busin"ess" which is appearing before bitcoin.  
@_date: 2015-08-02 16:08:46
People are educated enough to understand that "Bank CEO" does not imply CEOs of all banks in the world and the headline is speaking about one particular bank, however, at this point , most people are not educated enough about bitcoin to understand that bitcoin does not have any chief and reading such title will only make an impression in their mind that bitcoin is some company whose chief has been arrested.
