We have survived China FUD! We have survived MT GOX! We have survived years of stagnation only to comeback stronger than ever! THIS TOO SHALL PASS!
This latest round of crypto craze put a lot of eyes on the crypto market, and once it settles, they will be back.

It’s discount time! This isn’t the first time we’ve hit 14.5 k in the last day. Once the panic about futures wears off I think we’ll be back on the path to 20 k too.

This is natural selection selecting HODLers long term

Oh no! Bitcoin is dying /s
Maybe it’ll take a day, maybe it’ll take a couple days, but strap into your rockets after this dip.

I can’t say for sure what will happen, but I bought into bitcoin first around 11,000 then again at 14,000, and bought in big around 17,000. Then I heard about futures and wanted to cash out, but I was locked in for over a week because I used Coinbase. I had to helplessly watch as it went down to 13ish and I thought it might keep going. Then it bounced back, and went higher. I was forced to ride the dip, and now I know the power of the HODL.
Don’t be reckless, but Bitcoin has came back with a vengeance after every major dip and crash in the past.

It’s definitely possible. I don’t think it will long term though, it has a track record of coming back from insane crashes and market bans stronger than ever.
I said it in another thread as a joke, but I really believe Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies naturally select for people that don’t panic sell and hold like it’s a religion. With every dip, people who panic, sell and a new holder buys a portion of that and raises the floor for mass selling.

Think longer than a week, I bought more today, and I’m recommending to everyone that will listen that they do the same.
