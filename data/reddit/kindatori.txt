XMR and ZEC are just a few examples
Bitcoin price has peaked, most other cryptos have not (and the above have potential for huge gains)
@_date: 2018-01-18 08:53:23
Just be careful. Bitcoin is the biggest and one of the first, but so was Friendster. I know it seems like an unsurmountable coin, but Bitcoin is not the best at anything as far as cryptos go. Actually, its the best at making people millionaires, but those days are likely in the rearview as other alts catch up and take the spotlight.

Jesus Christ, are you serious with this question?
Sometimes this sub takes an almost religious/scientologist approach to bitcoin, where all bad news is secretly the best news ever.
"Guys, bitcoin is down to 1 cent! BUY THE DIP!!! TO THE MOON WE GO! BEST TIME EVER FOR BITCOIN"

99.99% of CB interactions go smoothly. Sorry you got unlucky. Hopefully your bank can help out.

I'm guessing anywhere between 7k and 4k. Every crypto is going to drop significantly, I think we're only seeing the start right now.

It's not a sale in January if the price goes down even more in Feb.

Bitcoin is a dinosaur. Too many better cryptos in the game. Bitcoin was the get-rich-quick coin of 2017 but those days are behind it.

If I can be completely honest, the level of psychological backflipping this subreddit is engaging in in order to put a positive spin on things is scary. Sometimes it's ok to admit that things are not going good. It's especially helpful to have that level of honesty when it comes to potentially losing vast sums of money you've put toward an investment.

Sorry buddy. Try reading what OP wrote:


Sure sounds like he's saying they're a fraud.
@_date: 2018-01-18 02:33:01


What? You don't see a better alt?
Are your eyes sewn shut?
@_date: 2018-01-19 20:19:51
Yes. That's how you build a successful company, by having 99%+ of all transactions fail. Makes a lot of sense.
I understand you want to pitchfork hard against CB but it's not working.

Gosh, you're so woke.
@_date: 2018-01-19 08:54:49
It's not statistics it's common sense.
But yes, keep living in your bubble where the most popular domestic place to buy crypto is a massive fraud that steals everyone's money. That's how they became such a massive company. By stealing everyone's money. Makes a lot of sense.
@_date: 2017-12-28 20:47:37
Binance is the best imo.

Being the first is never a guarantee. Being the biggest isn't either. Facebook was but a dorm room creation that came long after behemoths like Friendster, Myspace, Livejournal, etc.

IF you want to make quick money in the short term, there are better coins to 'invest' in. Bitcoin already had its Big Bang moment. I'd advise any newbie to invest in Ripple as the growth will likely be quite rapid in the near future.

Because credit card purchases are often insured and covered, whereas bitcoin purchases offer no recourse or resolution other than hoping the company you're dealing with is feeling generous. There's no bank to complain to. It involves a vast amount of trust, whereas CC purchases already have some level of assurance built in. Easy choice.
Let's stop pretending we're doing anything other than gambling and trying to buy Lamborghinis.

Yes, and when it's a dollar you can say "well it used to only be 9 cents, it's still waaaaaay up"

Good luck getting widespread bitcoin adoption then. Gotta give people a reason to switch their payment methods. Otherwise this whole crypto thing will forever be a jungle full of pump-and-dump shitcoins and nothing else.

lol? "Don't say anything remotely negative about bitcoin scenarios! Please! You're hurting our chances at becoming millionaires!"
I never said I knew what was going to happen. All I said is be smart and don't lose all your money.
@_date: 2017-12-28 21:58:26
It's 1.40 right now. If it even goes up to $14 that's a 1,000% increase. Bitcoin would need to hit $150,000 per btc to match those gains. Pretty obvious which one to go with as Ripple will likely be close to $5 at some point in Jan-Feb.
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:34:35
tl;dr: please don't sell guys please. I really need to become a millionaire so please don't sell. Just trust me, I know what's going to happen. Don't sell, trust me bro.
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:22:39
Yes, and if by January btc is at 5k you can then argue "But it was only worth 4k in August so it's still going up."
You can keep moving the goalposts to make your narrative work. I get it. If I had a bunch of money in this I'd be trying to calm myself down too. Just don't get too carried away.

In my opinion, the problem is bitcoin is a cryptocurrency yet not even 1% treat it as a currency but, instead, as an investment. That's really what bitcoin is, an investment - the more people that pay in, the more the value goes up. The more people that cash out, the more the value goes down.
Not everyone is going to cash out at the same time. The same amount of money that went into bitcoin is the same amount of money that will come out of bitcoin in the end. The idea that everyone is going to walk away a millionaire is the biggest misconception people seem to have. Bitcoin doesn't invent fiat.
There will be some lucky ones, and a lot of unlucky ones.
As for a true cryptocurrency, there are other coins that are more suitable for real world use in the future. Bitcoin isn't that coin. When you see big investment groups getting in on the action that tells you everything you need to know: it's an investment. It's not a currency.
imo Bitcoin is an experiment on how not to treat a cryptocurrency. Treating it as a get-rich-quick scheme is going to be what ultimately kills it.
Again, just my opinion.

A 33% drop in value is a bit more than a 'dip'. I admire your positivity, but watching this sub go crazy and try to pep-talk one another is kind of depressing. I know some of you guys are not sleeping and terrified but try to remember that this crazy train ride could end at any given moment. None of you know what's going to happen, and ruining your financial situation because you refused to sell your bitcoin is something that will be hard to get over.
