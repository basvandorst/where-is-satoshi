Understood when would it be appropriate when we reach certain funding milestones in the future?

A RepRap is able to print itself minus the electronics and stepper motors and extruder. This is why the designs are open source and getting cheaper.

Yay bitcoin wallets with biometric encryption.

p2pool is the answer to part two.

Thank you.

We are getting an pursa i3v sorry for any miscommunication.
We are a group of 3 so far in North Bay, Ontario, Canada. We have been looking into 3D printing for the past several months and have decided to use bitcoin for all our needs, paying salaries, ordering supplies, and accepting clients. This is our first project experimenting in alternative currency and new managerial styles. I hope you can help fund us. If you want we can make something custom for your time and money.
@_date: 2014-06-10 03:34:47
Maybe you where not following the sellers instructions, do not ask western union for bitcoin lol.
@_date: 2014-06-26 12:38:08
Normally following the Canadian Revenue Agency guidelines. 
We decided to hire and outside accountant who agreed to take care of it all for us.

Tom says spicy mustard and ham, Ben claims baked cheddar cheese and ketchup, and Bober is a fan of Jalapeños, havardi and Polish sausage.
@_date: 2014-06-17 02:58:40
p2pool is the solution.
@_date: 2014-07-04 23:24:00
Have you decided to send an email to every customer announcing this that might help boost bitcoin sales.
@_date: 2014-06-03 22:49:03
If you want to fund a custom amount we can set up a custom print to send as a reward.
@_date: 2014-06-26 12:36:28
We 3D print all the ABS parts and source the motors and as we call it in the industry, the vitamins. After a thank you note its all taped up and shipped on its way.

Our vote is still undecided, and will stay unannounced until the deadline to make sure we are not swaying public opinion.
@_date: 2014-07-19 18:13:59
We would need the money to pay rent and order any office supplies, Just the printer is not our only cost.
We are currently assembling leads and working on our marketing department. 
Here are a couple test prints.
@_date: 2014-06-04 02:58:50
Printing a house is possible but not with the equipment we will be using unless you print it one brick at a time.
@_date: 2014-07-19 18:17:33
 Test prints
Can you 3d print (with your printer of course) every part to assemble your printer?  Not the model we are looking for but every part is open source and the frame is done using a laser cutter.
What's the average lifespan for parts? 50 prints? 500 prints? A 1000?
Several thousand and any part that is likely to break can be replaced via 3D printing other then the motors.
How hard is the process to configure the printer? Can someone who wants to print a one piece product be able to to do it in a reasonable time?
We did our pokemon in just over an hour each after about 10 minutes of calibration work.
What levels of competencies does a user need? Are their any prerequisites needed to operate the printer or design prototypes?
We where able to make our printer and print our first parts after about 2 days of work. As for the model files we have a Ben doing that work for us as he is skilled in Blender.

Please explain how they stop 51% attacks.

Sign up find someone that is trading the amount you want and buy it.

Seems like distraction for not getting p2pool working in time.
@_date: 2014-07-07 00:45:03
Google the miner you are using.
@_date: 2014-07-05 04:38:54
their best interests to keep the shareholders happy.
Because without this distraction we would be unhappy about the lack of p2pool
@_date: 2014-07-27 01:37:02
Wow thank you for posting this for us. We are here for an AMA if anyone's around
@_date: 2014-06-04 03:09:30
Or you could fund us for a fraction of the price and get some custom work done.
@_date: 2014-06-26 12:55:59
Actually there is if our crowdfunding turns out leaving us with room to get one, 
@_date: 2014-06-26 16:30:59
Using software such as OPENSCAD or Blender you make a model then using slic3r you make it into a .gcode file aka machine readable code.
We did get 100% pledged buy feel free to still fund us and get rewards or give us a bigger budget to work with.
@_date: 2014-07-04 21:03:55
Darkwallet is the bestest.

I have made a few BTC in the short game still waiting to see if mid and long game on PETA works out the new updates have me worried because any change worries me. It might be anxiety of good news too.
@_date: 2014-07-04 21:14:20
Please post the XSS to btc-e support they might reward you for finding it.
@_date: 2014-06-26 23:46:39
Seems like the influx of funders have pushed our project into moderation,  Check back a few times and it should be up good to go soon! I will save this post to contact you when it goes up.
@_date: 2014-07-19 18:14:26
It is what we are hoping for.
@_date: 2014-06-03 23:45:52
Why not donate and buy back the coin you donated. Like that you still have your 10000 next year. By allowing us to create bitcoin jobs this will increase the value of your coins in the long run.
@_date: 2014-06-18 04:30:43

We are RepRapMaker. A 3D printing start up hoping to use bitcoins for paying our worker owned cooperative and our suppliers please contact us for more information, We would be happy to help you and your project.
@_date: 2014-06-26 12:35:17
It is non-recoverable, lower fees, unlike PayPal or creditcards ANYONE can get some bitcoin and support our work or get something done.
@_date: 2014-06-14 18:19:25
p2pool could have 90% of the hashrate and not be able to double spend.

@_date: 2014-06-05 00:23:18
We are a worker owned cooperative from North Bay, Ontario. We would fill the need of manufacturing at a much lower cost to those in need. There is a lot of poverty and we are hoping to become a non-profit organization.
We are asking for the extra BTC to cover a couple months rent and paying our first 3 employees until we are able to sustain ourselves. We have done the market research and have strong leads ready. We also need to purchase a filament and other start up costs.
We are asking to help bring something wonderful to an area that really needs it while getting a little bit back with custom prints.
I hope this answers any questions if not please reply.
@_date: 2014-07-19 18:18:09
Here our are first test prints 
Maybe that will restore some faith.
@_date: 2014-06-03 14:50:33
We are a worker owned cooperative from Northern Ontario. We are crowdfunding our business start up costs right now and we will be paying all our workers in bitcoin. Check out  for more info or PM us here.
@_date: 2014-06-26 15:22:58
That we are attempting to do!
@_date: 2014-07-04 20:32:17
For anything we cannot pay with BTC we will be converting for the rare expense such as rent, other then that we support organizations like joinsnapcard.com in helping us be able to buy anything we might need. As you bitcoiners seem like say for the rest HODL.
@_date: 2014-06-03 06:48:37
Thank you for the funding efforts If you want to send more we would be happy to send you some out our first prints even custom work.
@_date: 2014-07-04 21:02:04
Our 3D printer and filament will be paid for in either bitcoin directly or by use of joinsnapcard.com. We also have your typical office costs, furniture form overstock, computers from tigerdirect and newegg, and paper pens and other office supplies. 
We are looking into getting our landlord to accept bitcoin for our space and our other bills are included in that cost.
Yes we think anything we can do to strengthen the network should be a requirement for a bitcoin cooperative/company.
@_date: 2014-07-04 20:40:58
As long as they start working on p2pool I will keep reinvesting.

What does SQL and bitcoin have in common?
@_date: 2014-06-03 02:09:35
There seems to only be a handful of companies right now.
We are willing to offer the best customer service in regards to product satisfaction and business standards. At the same time working as a worker owned coop and not a typical hierarchical organizations meaning our focus is offering the best we can and not our profit margin. 
We are also looking to pay our workers in BTC and order only from BTC accepting suppliers to keep fiat completely out of the equation. Simply put, fast service with a smile.
@_date: 2014-06-26 13:03:46
@_date: 2014-06-09 08:09:36
Can be made! Would you be interested in funding us and we can send you a set of lovely jubblies.
@_date: 2014-07-04 20:54:34
We are reprapmaker and we can 3D print any bitcoin object, please feel free to PM us for a quote and/or support our crowdfunding to expand our operation. 
@_date: 2014-06-10 07:16:21
We are planing on using just bitcoin for our startup, we will be paying workers and suppliers in BTC.  &lt;&lt; should be live soon, waiting on admin approval.
@_date: 2014-07-16 03:35:13
I think we are actually the first to pay our workers in bitcoin and order supplies in bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-06-14 03:54:18
51% hashrate by any one pool or miner is very bad. Thus we are trying to stop ghash gaining anything more then 40%
@_date: 2014-07-05 02:37:17
My point was that because they cannot do p2pool they are doing a coverup to double the dividend payout.
@_date: 2014-07-04 23:26:49
Contact support with proof of you account. Maybe boot up you miner and see if the conf files have the answer.
