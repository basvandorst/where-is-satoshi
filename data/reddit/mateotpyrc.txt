There is no current form of multi-universal communication. Until then we and Bitcoin will be limited to this universe. 
If it were multi-universal, it would be difficult to keep the network in sync. So it’s probably better to keep it CENTRALIZED to this universe.

Referring to people who raise concerns about making BTC better as FUDsters is not productive. I love BTC, but the technology is not perfect yet. As a community we have to find it’s flaws to improve it. If we were all fanatics who ignored criticism, the network would never progress.

Your thesis seemed to be: Once it becomes widely adopted as a store of value, it will become a medium of exchange as well. With current fees, I would only use it in a transactions over $1k. I and probably most people make transactions of that scale very infrequently.

He actually later clarified he meant Bitcoin Cash going to $500k 
He made the bet before the fork and said that The chain that Jihan supports would go to $500k

In theory yes, but he specified that if the bet is with relation to the bch chain. So I guess BCH and its future chain splits.

Probably another correction before that happens

That is a very insignificant price movement in the cryptosphere

Thanks. I have an AWS account, I'll try setting it up with that or the PI bot depending on which proves to be easier.
