Would miner subsidies work, if a miner could prove they were mining at a certain location?  
Think of it this way: N imaginary points, spread out evenly over sections of the globe.  The closer you are to a point,  the more mining subsidy you get. These points rotate around the globe at a formulaic,  predictable pattern so that other areas are exposed to subsidies. Points can perhaps be added by consensus.  The higher the collective hash rate is at a point, the lower the subsidies.

A interaction-less pull is indeed what I am trying to figure out.  However, a psuedo-pull, or, stated differently, a "push on my behalf" would accomplish this.
**Use Case: Push On My Behalf**
I would like to allow an entity to push funds from my wallet at a BTC amount no greater than X at cadence of Y. This will only work if pushed into to a specific address agreed upon in advance and demonstrably controlled by said entity. The integrity of the amount, cadence, and target address would be enforced via a blockchain-based smart contract, so that the entity could not take more than they should.

Coinbase kind of does this with their recurring transactions, yes.  However, it would be best if this could be implemented on the blockchain level via smart contracts.

The bad actor bundled the malware into the executable *after* compilation of the source code.
The source code didn't have the malware, so it wouldn't have done any good if Andreas would have inspected it.

This is quite brilliant - thanks for taking the time to explain!

Thanks for the tip.
Do you think this concept would work at the blockchain level?  
I guess I am looking to create a whitelisted address encumberance.

It sure looks like that is the case.   I imagine that one could have fun trolling the not-yet-savvy scammers on November 18th.

Welcome,  Andrew.  If you were to craft cryptocurrency regulations for your state, how would they differ from the proposed BitLicense in NY? 
@_date: 2014-03-25 01:48:35
Sure, I'll play along with the hypothetical. If the Bitcoin network were to go down, miners would probably target their hardware at a cryptocurrency with a likewise proof of work algorithm.

It is unwise to use this.
Here is a snippet from the CSS:
    body {

    }
If you were to use this userstyle, you would be reporting to the above URL every time you loaded BitStamp.  They'd have your IP on file via server logs.

How does one measure the degree of bitcoin decentralization, or lack thereof, at any given time? 
@_date: 2017-03-27 20:47:36
- Has anyone researched and modeled scenarios with regard to how quickly, and to what severity, centralization would potentially be realized post-fork?
- What are the economic and game theoretic reasons for the centralization to sustain itself? 
- Is there a succinct, objective measurement or metric indicating the degree of centralization at a given time?

Do you happen to remember anything else about the whitepaper? I'm having a hard time finding it based on  the details you provided.

Theoretically, if 100% of miners decide to produce a certain new type of block, and there are nodes to support it, what happens to the former type of block?

Are miners expected to altruistically mine bitcoin when it may not be as profitable as something else? Should they not react to cross-coin market forces? Should they not do what may be in their best interest as it correlates with their particular investment strategies and/or shareholder directives?

The new reality is that, because one should expect miners to act in their best interest, as subjective or irrational as it may be, bitcoin currently has a legitimate sha256 hashpower competitor. It's legitimacy as a hashpower competitor simply stems from the fact that it has significantly more than zero value at present. It may be a joke, but if one has the opportunity to make a fortune off of a joke, that opportunity should expect to be siezed.
Be it long or short term, we know exactly what the miners will do. They will act in their subjective best interest as it correlates with what they perceive to be worthwhile, and that best interest is not 100% guaranteed to be mining bitcoin.

Of course, but if those 99 nodes decide to reject blocks from miners unless the miners entertain their interests, wouldn't it be in the best interest of the miners to comply, instead of relying on your 1 node? 
Yes, this is all very theoretical, but I am trying to understand how node decentralization and miner decentralization can be trustlessly proven.
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:43:05
Let us say, for sake of argument, that there are 100 nodes in the blockchain. You control one of them, and you run your node as you see fit.
However, the other 99 nodes, even though they appear to be unique, decentralized, and separate, are actually run by a central authority. 
Would they not be able to strong-arm your node?

This isn't an accurate measurement; multiple pools may appear to be separate, but what if there's an alliance between them?

If higher fees are good, and lower block sizes cause higher fees, what's the argument against lowering the block size ?

What's the most reliable way of measuring the level of miner decentralization ?
@_date: 2016-02-25 02:40:53
I've added *ceteris paribus* to scope the argument and make the premise more sound. 
@_date: 2016-02-24 03:04:23
The term "dust" is relative to the current transaction fee. As fees go up, so does the measure for what dust is. Eventually, if the network gets clogged enough, and transaction fees rise accordingly, it's not unrealistic to say that a $20 purchase for a game on Steam can be called dust.

How can true decentralization occur without the ability to trustlessly disclose ones geographic location, business interests and affiliations, and governmental alignments?

How does this data tell you that their actions are meant to pump and dump?  Are you considering it an impossibility that bitcoin is simply becoming popular in China,  which is increasing demand and therefore price?
