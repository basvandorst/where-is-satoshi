It's even better. She thinks of Bitcoin as a Ponzi scheme:

I don't approve of this message either.
I partially agree with what is stated there. I don't like general statements that try to "herd" people behind one public opinion in order to pretend unanimity. It misses valuable perspectives and is not what decentralization is about.
I stated years ago, that I see the blocksize debate as a mirage.
Personally I am fine with two distinct visions for Bitcoin; be it Bitcoin "Cash" or Bitcoin "Settlement". If people think we need another fork. So it be. It's a decentralized system. It's permissionless. I value distinctions between people and different approaches. This is why I concluded to invest in all of them. I might not hit the jackpot by doing so. But in the end I'm guaranteed to win. 
Decentralized currency is a win for everybody no matter he uses it or not, as it redistributes power to the people.
We're united in the aim of creating an alternative to fiat banking. That's where our motivation and power comes from. No matter how divided you got over blocksize identity politics over the last years. The ways to get to ones shared goals may differ. Still you can have respect for another person or groups path.
Some people choose to start with you and at some point decide to take another branch. Some people choose to go the other direction from the start. Have respect for all of them. Everybody is on the way. The goal is the same.
Decentralization is about empowerment. No one can deny your right to live, if you do not consent. You can always go your own way. If you think the outcome is about "one" to rule them all, you might have something upside down. Because that is essentially what centralization is all about.

not what I meant. It's about the transactional capacity, that Bitcoin currently provides and is needed to work as a store of value. If it is actually used as such is dependent on several other factors.

...and I am not sured, if you have read the article or are commenting on the headline only!?

The Bitcoin 1% will converge with the Dollar 1% once they abandon the sinking ship.
So it's about the new 1% (=new money elite of the world).

only ~2B people are financially "included" as of today.

have you read the article? Bitcoin as is works already perfect, if our goal is to use it as a store of value only for "the 1%".

Thank you Balaji. This comes closest to what I've been  proposing here one year ago:
