I'm not as technically educated on this as I'd like to be. Hearn's histrionics frankly didn't do any favors to anyone, including him, but the concern is real enough. 
I suspect that 2 Mb would be sufficient for quite some time, and of course sidechains have a lot of potential for commerce as well. 
However, I don't think that data storage running a full node is as big a concern as many seem to think. I remember very well when 40 Megabytes was a HUGE hard drive. Now I can buy a 3 Tb drive at Walmart for just over a hundred dollars. Raising the block size is unlikely to cause it to grow as fast as cheap storage ability. 
I recently saw someone (I can't recall who, but someone well known in bitcoin space) say something about changing algorithms if we're really serious about decentralization. ASIC's changed the landscape. My opinion on how good or bad that is? Well, I don't have one. I'm quite divided in this. On the one hand, it does tend to leave the bulk of the block chain to a few competitors. On the other, it makes it nearly impossible to fork the damn thing without consensus. And no, pools are not centralization in any major way. If a pool is operating in a sub par or suspicious manner, miners WILL switch. We've all seen it happen. 
If BTC is to compete in a real manner with fiat currency, let alone credit cards, it needs to be able to handle a LOT more transactions than it currently does. But there is no emergency. This can be discussed, and if necessary, half measures are ok. Whatever the case, whatever is done should be thoroughly tested to destruction on testnet before it's even considered for Core.
