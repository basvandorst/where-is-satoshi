@_date: 2018-01-18 03:00:32
Can someone please explain this? 
@_date: 2018-01-07 22:07:31
That person is Satoshi Nakamoto. The creator of bitcoin.

Lmao yeah this guy def bought at 19 and sold at 9
@_date: 2018-01-03 00:28:45
Please let us know of the developments
@_date: 2018-01-22 18:42:09
As each dip became bigger and bigger my curiosity to see much lower it can go became bigger and bigger. Now I genuinely welcome a 2k BTC price just to see what happens and obviously to buy a shit ton of coin. 
@_date: 2018-01-02 23:29:53
@_date: 2017-12-27 04:09:15
So its still not there? 
@_date: 2017-12-23 13:16:19
Excellent. Would these next to nothing fees deter miners to mine anymore though?? Or that is being covered by the speed and volume if the transactions that they can confirm now.

@_date: 2017-12-11 20:05:41
Yes Quadriga can be trusted.

You’re not alone
@_date: 2017-12-15 18:19:17
BTC or possibly even quicker trading other cryptos
@_date: 2017-12-27 07:09:05
Thankfully i will be hodling long term so hopeful the updates will lower the fees. Thanks for the response.
@_date: 2017-12-26 22:38:47
Was it there?
@_date: 2018-09-09 13:32:02
Oh shut the fuck up with this losing its value misinformation so you make people buy in this trash bear market so they lose all their fucking money in a week. Theres a reason why you lot keep reverting back to this argument and that is because fiat is still SO valuable in the world thats its your go to excuse to make this market make sense. Fiat is not going ANYWHERE and it hasnt lost its value. Just because your dumb asses werent alive 317 years ago to buy pounds which would be worth millions today doesnt mean its lost its value in REALITY.

The wallets or exchanges you are using must be segwit enabled. The wallet addresses start with a 1 or a 3. Do a quick internet or even reddit search to see which wallets and exchanges are segwit enabled. They post on here very often.
@_date: 2017-12-26 16:27:04
Wait so if my nano is set to segwit and i wanna send btc to an address like a coinbase exchange for example that doesnt have segwit support the coins wont transfer?
@_date: 2017-12-31 13:58:52
I transfered $2000 worth of bitcoin for just $7 fee on segwit and confirmation took under 10 mins. The problem is retards who are sending their $20  allowance worth of bitcoins to make $3 in a year. If u dont have the capital for the investment, invest in altcoins where you can make more money.
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:59:42
Isnt it obvious? Buy him a crypto portfolio!
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:27:42
christmas is here babyyyyyy
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:49:59
LOL hodl is a lifestyle
@_date: 2017-12-26 03:12:45
This is such a big problem and nobody seems to care. The only answer anyone can really give is “lightning network”. When thats coming god only knows.
@_date: 2017-12-23 13:03:13
How much are the fees in the tests?
@_date: 2018-09-18 01:36:24
Lower. We will see 3k before pump
@_date: 2018-08-16 11:52:05
Day 245: still not rich.
@_date: 2018-08-25 03:48:34
Im in the club too
@_date: 2018-05-21 00:08:16
Whats the trash trading volume lately. More people are trading goats than bitcoins it seems.
@_date: 2018-05-24 12:55:10
Wtf is this trash
@_date: 2018-05-24 12:57:12
@_date: 2018-05-28 13:45:24
Is there even any new money around to panic sell? Whoever is in now is old money or new money with enough balls to hodl no matter what.
@_date: 2018-05-16 13:49:46
Performing like hot garbage
@_date: 2018-10-02 17:07:23
Hurry up
@_date: 2018-10-17 13:27:48
@_date: 2018-10-05 13:03:13
When is this cunt bucket going on a bullrun? 
@_date: 2018-10-03 20:30:35
If i get a full btc does that mean ill be a multi millionaire in 10 years?
@_date: 2018-10-06 13:25:42
When is this trash going up? Dont come in here acting like youre satisfied where its at. Its been sideways for almost a year. 
@_date: 2018-10-22 00:34:29
Are you tense?
@_date: 2018-10-01 17:24:10
No im gonna hold it but i wanna be rich. Why’s it not making me rich. Make it do something.
@_date: 2018-10-05 19:18:44
Why would i sell at a loss? Im gonna hold for ever until its 10 million each. I have a full coin. But im also not happy that it hasnt done fuck all this year.
@_date: 2018-10-16 17:58:32
Whats the excuse for it not moving up today? When rich?
@_date: 2018-10-10 13:34:32
Patiently waiting for the next batch of greater fools.
@_date: 2018-10-02 17:07:51
@_date: 2018-10-24 13:44:23
������ is this a bullrun? 
@_date: 2018-10-06 15:17:44
Yes. Just wanna make a quick buck. Cant care less about the tech. 
@_date: 2018-10-05 13:02:11
Its been coming for a year and jack shit has happened. 
@_date: 2018-10-27 16:27:55
Fuck off
@_date: 2018-10-01 17:14:23
When is this trash making me rich waited for a year now and nothing.
@_date: 2018-10-05 14:24:43
Im not rich yet so i dont care. Just wanna make a quick buck.
@_date: 2018-10-22 14:28:52
This better happen cuz im just here to get rich and i like those numbers.
@_date: 2018-06-10 22:53:42
But i dont live in or have business in any of those countries. I live in Canada. Banks are very safe here.
@_date: 2018-06-02 13:41:42
Trash volume as usual
@_date: 2018-06-11 02:23:19
You forgot Bonnie.
@_date: 2018-06-11 13:57:35
Fully agree with what you said. I’ve invested a substantial amount with at least a 5-10 year plan to hodl depending on if the market picks up. At this point in time for hodlers who are looking to profit we either need a whale bailout, the next batch of new fomo investor or big money institutions/main stream media outlets to get this market going again. Preferably a mix of all of those things working together. Because clearly new tech developments are not moving this market right now. Every day we hear some amazing news about a piece of innovation or tidbits of potential mainstream use-case and price spirals downwards with such low trading volume. The market is speaking if we listen closely. I was told in one of the comments that I am not the type of person who should be investing in bitcoin and should wait until the price fully settles. I think the people who just believe in the tech for their financial safety should be waiting for the price settle and convert their fiat into crypto and live their lives when and if crypto becomes what its intending to be. But in order for that to happen, people like me are contributing into making that dream come true by taking the risk for the greater rewards.
@_date: 2018-06-11 20:33:06
Nobody can tell you what ~~the matrix~~ bitcoin is. You have to see it for yourself.
@_date: 2018-06-11 13:39:11
Well I can say the same thing for bitcoin. You also have negligible influence over bitcoin unless you are a whale. They decide how much your currency is worth. Not you. 
@_date: 2018-06-11 14:14:37
Sounds like you did that and are taking it out on me. Thankfully I know not to do something so stupid because I’ve invested an amount i am comfortable to lose.
@_date: 2018-06-11 01:24:35
If you think the banks are going anywhere because of a microscopic cryptocurrency market you also have a lot to learn.
@_date: 2018-06-11 13:28:24
You dont think BTC has better/safer odds than those? 
@_date: 2018-06-11 13:14:07
This is it right here. I dont know why its so hard to grasp for some people. I dont care about the tech because if it dominates it will benefit me and if it doesnt I dont care. On to the next opportunity to profit. This tech isnt going to save my life in some way that I owe it my gratitude. Some people are really defensive on Bitcoin. Its been a decade and its still not achieved its main goal. We will see if it ever will. So far its made progress sure. But its got a long way to go. Its not me and you that have to believe in it if its to get mainstream adoption. Its the big guys who need to believe in it and implement it into the daily lives of the general public. 
@_date: 2018-06-11 00:23:08
Please provide your IBAN and SWIFT code.
@_date: 2018-06-10 22:58:54
But you guys keep saying the bank isnt safe. You dont say why. Have they stolen your money before? Have they directly wronged you? They’ve kept your money and insured your money. They have benefited you. They provide loans. I can go on but its obvious really what banks are used for.
@_date: 2018-06-10 22:45:00
Came to explain why banks arent safe? 
@_date: 2018-06-11 14:12:40
Yes and as long as we keep using the term speculative bubble for the evolution of bitcoin it will be used as a profit making machine and prolong its desire for stability. 
@_date: 2018-06-03 11:00:42
Vienna itself is just pure class.
@_date: 2018-06-28 14:12:58
Things are already worse and will keep getting even worse. Market is either completely dead or will take years to start back up. Put your nano ledger away and and say goodbye for a while. Treat it like a lottery. 
@_date: 2018-06-22 14:12:09
Its dead. Im not selling cuz its a lottery for me now incase it goes up. But man is this ride over. Performing like hot garbage and trash trading volume. Sure if it goes up ill be happy but this trash is fucking dead for now. I dont give a fuck about the tech i just want some new retards to come and make the price go up. Fuck all this bullshit. I just wanna get rich quick.
@_date: 2018-06-13 11:41:25
Was he already rich when he did that?
@_date: 2018-06-11 01:16:53
Absolutely. The ratio of everyday safe banks that the general public use to unsafe banks is astronomical and very dependant on where you live.
@_date: 2018-06-10 20:32:53
Why the fuck isnt this trash going up? How much longer do we have to wait until some fucking retards fomo and drive the price up so we can get rich QUICK. Fuck the tech i want money
@_date: 2018-06-10 20:54:37
Honesty is the best policy...most of the time. 
@_date: 2018-06-19 21:43:51
@_date: 2018-06-15 11:44:57
Much wow.
@_date: 2018-06-09 15:47:17
Please dont buy bitcoin if u cant afford to buy a decent amount. Ur wasting ur money.
@_date: 2018-06-10 22:25:29
I love banks. They have never done me wrong. 
@_date: 2018-06-11 14:20:06
Channel your anger young grasshopper.
@_date: 2018-03-17 16:13:38
Who’s we?
@_date: 2018-03-09 18:11:54
OP please keep the $100 and use it for entertainment or bills or something. $100 in bitcoin is a waste of time and has clearly caused you unnecessary headache.
@_date: 2018-02-02 02:34:36
please keep this going. 
@_date: 2018-03-18 21:09:47

No you wont.
@_date: 2018-07-02 14:48:30
Sick of the posts where someone says “still up 5738283748% from my investment even at this price”. Well fuck you bud. Many of us didnt get in early snd we dont give a flying fuck if ur still up.
