STOP TALKING ABOUT MT GOX
@_date: 2014-02-24 05:23:47
 I think it is a Gox insider. They moved their coin to Bitstamp to sell. Then take the fiat back to Gox and double their coins. Heck they could do it over and over until real Gox users run out of coins to sell.

@_date: 2013-12-13 05:59:50

@_date: 2013-11-19 02:24:10
I think China is having server problems.  Look at fiatleak.com

It all depends on your level of verification  but 6 or 7 days is about right for first purchase
