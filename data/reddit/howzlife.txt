Thank you :). None of my friends or family have any idea of any of this, and I dont want them to. I am trying to fix everything as best I can, but worst come to worst I would rather declare bankruptcy than be miserably in debt forever

I'm not looking to trade with anyone here. A month ago I was contemplating bankruptcy, and so far I've gotten 20 btc back from the scammer, with many more to come. I want to pay back my bank and get myself out of this mess. Also, I'm posting a screenshot of the tickets I've raised with localbitcoins, if anyone cares

I'm not sure what his address is in the UK, he was living in the Byward market in Ottawa. From what I was told he's been evicted, so the address that I know of wouldn't be of much help. 
He was living at 90 George St in Ottawa.

I think having someone to advise me is the best advice on here. I had someone recommend localbitcoins, and not exchanges due to issues

If you're mad that he had a naked girl on him way back in 2009, then I'll assume you havent had one on you since then

Serious question- wouldnt a company like mt gox have insurance, in case of a major theft like this?

Site is legit, but be VERY VERY careful with online trades. Ivw tried accepting paypal n banl to bank transfer n gotten scammed. Do NOT accept any reversible type of payment, only cash deposit. And unless someome has 100+, I wouldnt trade online with them - Ive been scammed by a 30+ 100% buyer

So over 180 million americans have heard of bitcoin

Which ones are safest? Im in Canada, so which ones can I access?

Holy shit its like the phantom of the opera just swooped in

I am in Canada, this is my first experience selling coins. I should have asked here before, I had a friend who knows more about it recommend localbitcoins as I could get transfers directly into my bank. I even called RBC beforehand to see if I was protected as a seller for member to member transfer, they said I was fine.

I'd wait a few weeks for the hype to build up again. When it seems like nothing can go wrong again, sell.

Any chance you need a developper? Im friends with one of the guys who worked on the BitAccess ATM, he's currently looking for some contract work
@_date: 2014-07-12 23:49:23
I should note I'm in Canada. Can I use Coinbase?
@_date: 2014-11-05 22:37:35
Happened to me in canada, I got fucked pretty hard on it. DO NOT accept bank or online transfers!!

SPARTAN HODL!

Ive put an ad on kijiji and localbitcoins for in person sales, no bites yet

Hey Guys, I...  Uhh... I'm here for the circlejerk?

Free hat! Free hat! Free hat!

These Bitcoin people are all sheep. Bitcoin gets slaughtered over and over again, people keep getting robbed blind with no recourse, yet its always "good news". Pathetic.

Can anyone translate this? Is he passing himself off as John Macleod now? 
@_date: 2015-08-18 03:15:38
Can we stop this crystal-ball bullshit?
@_date: 2015-04-15 03:34:32
Didn't we have this doomsday talk last week?
@_date: 2015-03-05 02:49:18
Not denying that. Just saying this is pretty stupid humour. I can almost hear yakkety sax in the background.

This is stupid. Karpeles may be a criminal, but CryptoCobain is a bundle of sticks

Difference is, customers accounts at the bank shouldn't be compromised (i.e. The banks insurance should be covering the loss if I'm not mistaken?). When a bitcoin exchange gets hacked, well.....
@_date: 2015-02-16 16:40:08
Nothing. They should absolutely be doing that, and its crazy that they're not.
I'm guessing premiums are crazy high though due to the prevalence of theft and stigma attached to it. 
@_date: 2015-02-23 21:12:11
Thats the secret. Its always low. 
@_date: 2015-02-16 22:14:08
I mean, Bitcoin doesn't get "hacked", the security systems guarding them are. Same as how the dollar wasn't "hacked" the banking systems were. Only difference is the safety net: one system has one and one doesn't. It's a pretty stupid argument

Great thing about credit cards is, once you have the number there are way too many month/year combinations over the possible lifespan of a credit card to even ATTEMPT to brute force it.
