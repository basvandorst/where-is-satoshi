I would think bitfinex and bittrex are the manipulated exchanges they deal with tether not gdax.

I personally use coinbase but only keep 10% of my btc on gdax to trade. But if your account is hacked then coinbase doesn't insure u. If they are hacked they do but only 2% of customer funds are online meaning 98% are in cold storage and if that's hacked then no insurance. I really enjoy coinbase and their interface but am not comfortable keeping high amounts of $ on there. Plus I bought in decently early so I feel comfortable with 20% or more pullbacks.

This feels to much like big hedge funds buying and driving price up to sell day be4 futures trading and buy short on futures.

Yeah but my government isn't that smart. And the US just keeps growing the debt.

Rather be the guy who didn't sell and sold 30 years later. Would have turned 150 per share into roughly 800. Basically 40% annual return.

Believe he said has stop loss so that can only be on exchange as far as I know. Hopefully he has a trezor or ledger.

Could bitcoin handle the transaction load if the government went all in. Cause then people that do as the government say would follow and don't think bitcoin is ready for mass adoption. Maybe few years when 2nd layer ready.

U have 130k on a exchange that is just crazy. 
@_date: 2017-08-22 16:34:34
Yeah kinda new but why even hide it. Cant get into his wallet from that. Right
@_date: 2017-11-28 17:56:30
Plus gdax isn't taking part in the tether pump
@_date: 2017-11-19 04:31:23
Plus only roughly 42% pay the entire balance of each month.

Only if u deposit using your bank. They are supposed to be making it instant like how it is  with credit card but so far it's only for select people.

If U Want To Lock In the price have to do on coinbase. Gdax takes at least 4 days usually more to get money available
@_date: 2017-11-27 08:01:58
Is only for select people that have large accounts. I have been verified and using coinbase for 8 months and deposit regularly and still when use bank it takes  a week.
@_date: 2017-11-27 07:39:35
U have to set up coinbase account first then link to gdax. And deposit to it but if use your bank to deposit it takes like 4 or so days just like on coinbase. What I do is constantly once a week do a gdax bank deposit that way always have money on gdax to use. Only way around is to do credit card deposit which is instant or btc.

I agree unless we are in a dip and u don't want to miss out. On gdax take 5 to 8 days for $ to be available to buy btc. Sucks paying fee on coinbase but if like last weekend when price went to below 6k u would have needed to buy on coinbase to get that price. If went gdax route u may have gotten $ Thursday and paid 7500. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 04:24:59
Yeah obviously but u know there is alot of people out there buying crypto thinking prices will just keep rising fast and they can pay it right back. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 06:50:08
When using your bank it's not instant
@_date: 2017-11-13 07:16:32
But isn't btc future lightning network which is centralised. Just wondering 
@_date: 2017-11-13 07:07:26
Bought bitcoin around april/may, so still new but hear alot of arguments about btc and bch. But isn't btc big future plan LN which blockstream/core backed by banks wants to use. I thought bitcoin was this anti banking anti government crypto. Just trying to understand everything.
@_date: 2017-11-19 01:51:56
Unless we are in a dip and want current price. Have to wait for gdax $ to deposit. I know they have instant deposit with credit card but I don't recommend buying btc and going into debt. They have started direct deposit with with debit cards but only for some people. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 10:15:56
The greatest benefit will be the etfs that will finally get approved once the futures market gets going.
@_date: 2017-11-27 07:40:54
Some people they have started doing instant debit card deposits but i think it's mainly for big accounts
@_date: 2017-09-19 06:18:06
And keep copy of keys in a safe that's fireproof if possible and don't have a pic of keys on phone. I made mistake about 6 months ago of keeping keys written down on piece of paper in my wallet and lost my wallet one day. Was only 125$ in bitcoin but that would be like 300 or so now. Invested in a ledger nano s and have 2 copies of keys secure now.

Yeah I want her to be able to experience the technology and not come to me for everything. Not that I can answer all her questions. I still learn something new almost every day.
