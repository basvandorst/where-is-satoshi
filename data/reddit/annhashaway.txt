It has happened every time there is a huge run. It has been like this for years, and everyone that has been on the ride for a while has been through it.

I tried to buy some at this ATM as well a while back. The process was way too cumbersome, and I eventually walked away. The pictures of your ID and face really turned me off too.

Thank you for recognizing that the vast majority of people will not touch bitcoin with a 10 foot pole in its current position. 
In almost no way is it "easier" to use than other forms of payment. If you have bitcoin in a wallet and know what you're doing, it may be a few seconds quicker at the point-of-sale. However, the steps involved with getting that bitcoin into the wallet is what will continue to prevent the masses from using it. (And when I say masses, I mean  people like your parents, grandparents, tech-noobs, etc.)
We get jaded here in because everyone is on a similar level in terms of bitcoin understanding. This is all pretty ridiculous to the average consumer.

False. CCs offer fraud protection and you are not responsible for charges you did not make. Lost or scammed BTC is gone. There is no recourse for the consumer.
Additionally, if you have a problem with a merchant's service or product and they are not willing to fix it for you, you can make a charge back on your CC and get your money back.
OK, one more - CCs usually offer additional protection for purchased goods, such as extending the warranties and flat out replacing damaged or lost items. AMEX will replace a damaged item, even if its your fault, within 90 days, up to $1,0000. That is a very strong incentive for consumers.

Standard real-time bandwagon reporting (opinions). 
What sells during a fall is everyone agreeing with it. Since many people bail when things go down, they look for confirmation they did the right thing. Reporting (or spouting opinions) the masses want to hear, rather than doing actual reporting.

Second, I apologize. My comment was directed a little more to the conversation you replied to.
Third, the bitcoin community has become divided between two main view points in how it should go forward. Rather than work together and solve the issues to advance, the community has resorted to a level of hatred toward each other that mirrors the current US political divide. It has become more important to defeat the enemy within the same community, than band together and advance the cause of all.

Running a node doesn't pay you. It helps decentralize the verification process.
@_date: 2015-07-23 18:29:14
Yes, I agree it would have the same issues that come with centralization. My point is more for those who want to see bitcoin come out of the shadows and become a major player in the payment/wealth transfer space.
I don't necessarily think a new system would steal market share (as it currently is), but rather could leave bitcoin behind in terms of mass adoption.
Personally, I think there will always be a space for bitcoin. Especially among tech enthusiasts and developing nations. 
@_date: 2015-07-23 18:52:18
There is a reason companies spend billions on marketing every year. It works.
@_date: 2017-04-18 18:56:03
Excellent point. I notice within myself that when I don't take time away from the crypto scene, I start to think the success of the entire space is a foregone conclusion.
Sometimes it feels like we are all standing at a launch site arguing about which rocket team is going to build their Mars colony the fastest, and forgetting that we don't even know if we will successfully get humans to even land safely first. 
@_date: 2015-07-23 18:51:02
I do think your point about the internet is a good one. That is an example of a decentralized system (kind of) that ultimately is the backbone of everything. 
However, at this point, bitcoin could be replicated and deployed in very little time. Combined with mass marketing, the clone could derail bitcoin as the backbone before it even gets off the ground. 
@_date: 2015-04-09 19:18:04
I have been saving and preaching (within reason) bitcoin for a few years now, and it wasn't until I finally starting using it that I saw the true potential.
It was only a handful of months ago, but I bought something online and the check out speed blew my mind. Then I had a couple family members (who I had convinced to buy and store BTC a year or so ago) download wallets to their phone then instantly sent them $5 worth to show how easy it was.
Now a family member and I settle small debts constantly with BTC, despite being hundreds of miles apart. 
The final straw that solidified my view on this technology was recently when I was trying to automate a more significant amount of money (think a monthly salary) from one account to another. The fastest I could get it moved over with the smallest amount of effort (so no wires) was multiple days. The method I finally went with took five business days before the funds were available in the second account. It was that moment when I realized the current system is due for a major shift.
It never had occurred to me before because it was how it has always been (in my life). Yeah, checks take days. Yes, cash can be a pain. But if you have nothing to compare it to, there is no frame of reference.   
So the moral of the story is that it took me actually using it to see the true value.
@_date: 2015-04-09 18:06:56
When looking at this scenario from a completely rational standpoint, yes this makes sense. However, I do not believe this is a good representation of the average consumer.
1. Most people do not have Signature cards that give 2.2% cash back. Most cash back cards are in the 1% range, but that will only make up a fraction of those who actually use credit cards.
2. Most people are not rational when it comes to small details like this. If they were, not one would take out $20 from an ATM and pay a 15% fee to do it.
While I agree with the premise in theory, I doubt the information Ben Edelmen said above has a huge bearing on overall consumer adoption. 
Its more about marketing and making it user friendly (which it is not right now). Why else do so many people pay $1500 for a laptop from Apple just to watch movies and go on Facebook?
@_date: 2015-03-06 18:55:21
I was actually surprised when the payment screens would automatically reload within a matter of seconds. I have been moving bitcoin around for a while, but didn't realize how quick the actual bitpay confirmation would happen.
I always had that little concern about standing there in a convenience store waiting for confirmation and holding up the line. Now I know it doesn't happen.

I hear what you are saying, but come on. Does anything about the last two years make you think that bitcoin can evolve at a reasonable pace to keep speed with the new tech coming out?
There is tech out there with the potential to be a foundation for an entire new web landscape to be built on. Bitcoin can't even get the size of the blocks figured out. You think they will be able to keep pace? 
As a store of value, bitcoin has the edge. But dismissing everything else simply because it isn't bitcoin is ridiculous.

Did they interview the CEO (I thought he was dead), or was it one of the other bitcoin execs?
@_date: 2015-02-09 18:43:04
The underlying issue, IMO, is that it gives the banks an extra layer of confidence and allows them to take riskier bets that they would if there was no safety net.
So whether they have to pay back loans or not, they still have an emergency line of credit so they can keep swinging for the fences and stay in business.

It could go either way. There are many reports of businesses having their bank accounts shut down or new accounts denied when working with BTC services, but nothing really about personal accounts.
You could open an ING (Capital One 360 now) or Ally account if you are in the US fairly easily, and use that. They are online only savings and checking accounts. It just adds a day or two of transfer time to get cash into those first.
@_date: 2013-11-22 18:51:59
If the US economy crashed that hard in the near future, it would take down a good chunk of the world's economy with it. Everything would be ok for a few days/weeks, until every day services start to shut down. Gas stations, grocery stores, etc.
Those that recognize what is coming and get out of metro areas will be safer for longer. When it gets to that point in civilization, people do not really care about money, they care about survival. Water and ammo becomes the new bitcoin.
