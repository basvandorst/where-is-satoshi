This is an example of the quality of ethics in a person. An ethical person would realize right away that there was an error and report it to them. An unethical person would not and take the money and run. Good thing Bitcoins are not "anonymous" and can be traced. You also just reported a very specific amount of Bitcoin on a public forum. Expect Coinbase to come calling and if you report it back to them now you might not have charges pressed on you.

God, how much of this is really needed for the average user? I'm just starting out too and don't have one bitcoin to my name but I do have a transaction waiting to be cleared at coinbase. I don't care so much about anonymity and If I ever cash in I plan on reporting my gains. I also don't care about silkroad although I find it interesting but I shop local for my vise.
The only security I'm interested in is backing up an encrypted wallet. I'll probably be using a live boot distro as well to work on. Hell, I don't even do that for my current online banking / paypal etc and that's on a windows machine.

I hope it does but bitcoin is not easy to understand or explain. It's new and the average person is hesitant to jump in right now. We need better clients and more sites accepting it. Buying &amp; spending coins needs to be as easy as trading cat pictures. 
I just started learning and I'm a bit confused. And here I'm the computer geek in the family who fixes everyone's computer problems (I want to help). I try explaining to a friend who owes me money and he's not buying into it. There's too much uncertainty for him but I'll be starting small with him to build trust and learn this myself.
I'm going the slow route of buying coins from coinbase because I don't want to meet up with someone local to buy a few coins. I also don't want to deal with wire transfers or visiting some bank not of my choosing.
I definitely think it has a future and my biggest hope is it crushes paypal but its got a long way to go.

Yes, this is a nice and sobering correction. The quality of post are better but I think the opposite is about to happen. More speculators will be joining only because of gox and their 20k users joining per day. Even if that's cut in half, it's a lot of people wanting to buy and learn more.
Also, my first hand experience, after talking to friends at work about Bitcoin for a couple months, they now want in because of the drop. One who had been calling it Butcoin is all into learning about day trading now.
Looking to users to this subreddit, it's now at 35k. It will grow to 40k within the week.
@_date: 2013-06-28 18:53:19
I don't think miners are driving the price down. Just in the past 24 hours on Gox alone there were over 43K bitcoins traded. Each day there are 3600 coins mined. There's no way that can have as much of an impact as the speculators and I doubt every miner is selling their coins. 
It would be interesting to know what percent of newly minted coins are sold though. I also have no idea how much is earned in fees for the miners and how much of that is sold.

I'm actually having a terrible experience with your site. For the past two weeks I've been trying to get an order placed. I originally tried to order a video card and being new I signed up at checkout. That had some error and my order wasn't placed (it was for a video card that ran out of stock right away) even though I was given an address to send bitcoin. So, I sent in a support ticket and have been emailing back and forth with a guy named Greg about this. I finally got store credit and loaded up my cart again. 
I'm assuming the problem is you guys gave me a "coupon code" and not a "gift card". When I go to check out with a coupon code, I apply the code and proceed to checkout. AT THIS POINT IT THEN WANTS ME TO SEND ADDITIONAL FUNDS TO PAY FOR SHIPPING AND TAXES?! I'm assuming if I had gotten a gift card I could use that that like the little check box says, at checkout, and it would apply my credit to the entire order including taxes and shipping.
Sorry for the caps, I am getting sick of trying to fix this issue. I have been patient and Greg has been helpful. I would like to support bitcoin related businesses but this experience just sucks.
So as it stands right now, I have store credit and can't spend it. I am waiting on an email response, again. It typically takes two days to get a response. Today is the second day (and I sent another email anyways) so I hope this gets settled today.

I had the exact same thing happen to me but with a 1/4 of the amount of Bitcoin. The first thing I thought of was to report it and **NOT** to cash in. They responded and fixed the error within a day.
You cashed in. You knew it was not your Bitcoin but you took the effort to take advantage of an error in you favor. Seriously? You think this was free money? You're greedy and could have left the Bitcoin error in your account and within a couple days it would be back in their hands.
Oh, I'm sure you're not alone and it's Coinbase's fault. They are not likely to do anything. They'll take their money back but they most certainly lost money on the exchange rate thanks to you. This is another reason why I canceled my account. They've got problems but I won't be taking advantage of them. I wish them well.
@_date: 2013-04-05 03:02:37
Look, you'll be fine. I'm sorry if I sounded harsh. Just don't spend the money. Coinbase has database issues that I can't explain but it seems to be a common enough problem for them. They will be contacting you to credit that money back. If you search this subreddit for Coinbase you'll see other threads about people describing negatives or positives in their account. Good luck.

I just searched at bitcointalk about this issue and saw another person with the same problem. Apparently they solved the issue by signing up w/ their user name and not email. I believe I used my email as well and didn't even think to use my bitfunder user name. They need to be more clear about that. So, I'll try again tonight when I get home. I'm willing to be patient with these sites but damn it can be frustrating.

I've begun to think of Lightcoin as Betamax and Bitcoin as VHS. Lightcoin may have some advantages to Bitcoin but it's not significant enough to make a difference at this point in the adoption game. Until something superior comes along and becomes the DVD of crypto currencies, then Bitcoin will remain dominant.

LOl, good point. Like magnets, how does the banking system work? I couldn't explain either well at all. But I did already have a Visa card since it was established and in use for years before I set up a paypal account. We need to get to that level and I'm looking forward to those with the knowledge to figure this out and take it main stream.

Yup, too late for your rigs to get to work on this one. You could take the chance to invest in an asic but that's a long wait and costs $$. Best bet is to buy Bitcoins and dollar cost average over time because you don't know the direction it will go. You'll see lots of pros and cons here but mostly pros.
As far as alt coins go, I'm a fan of and looking forward to [Primecoin]( You've arrived just in time for Primecoin though.
