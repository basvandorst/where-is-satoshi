Thanks. Appreciate the information.

If you don't have the knowledge then go laugh somewhere else. This is simply a knowledge gathering exercise. Simply to understand "how it works". So don't waste your time and mine just to say it's laughable. Just move on if you dont have any information to share.

Consolidate how? Import to new wallet then transfer or import directly into old wallet?
Also what's a "private key sweep".

Ok that's sounds like a good feature. Also sounds like something I would have to know before hand. Will have to query Blockchain about that.

Great to see this happening and so quickly. Hopefully we will be at full implementation by the end of the year.

A very good question  but it would appear that we can't seem to get consensus on exactly what causes the fees to be lower (if they really are). I'm very interested to know too and reading the thread I'm still not sure. But waiting for more input.

I think the load on BTC is what's contributing to the delays in transactions. I have a friend who did a transaction and it's going 1 week now and no confirmation of the transaction. Gotta wait it out.

Could be the congestion on the BTC network that's causing that problem. Haven't seen any notice on the blockchain website however.

People are looking for any excuse to say that "see I told you it's a bubble and it would crash" very few want to apply an logic to the behaviour of what's happening so the minute they see a dip they immediately panic and start the FUD. If Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency was constantly going up with no dips or corrections then that's when you should be concerned. I'm just relaxing and getting as much as I can I'm the dip. It's the festive season everyone wants a little extra cash to spread around.

You have to look at BTC as a similar investment to stocks in terms of the fluctuation in price. The only difference I think is that BTC has a "trend" in the sense that there is a period where it will be on a bullish run then it levels off. This is decision time as to whether to hold on or cash out. During the level period it can go either way and sometimes it goes fast. I would say invest everything now and watch. The moment you've made a 50% profit withdraw that. Then watch again and do the same. It's basically a luck thing so hope you're lucky.
