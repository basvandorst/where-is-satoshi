Wasn't referring to all of Korea.  As the title says, its the Ministry of Justice whose top Minister started all of the FUD by saying they are drafting regulation for a total ban.

I do like the bigger screen on the KeepKey, and they are also open source.

True, but I wouldn't place the blame entirely on bitcoin.com.  The South Korean govt had announced their stance on ICOs right before the long Korean Thanksgiving holiday, so that the industry would have no immediate chance to make a response, and giving ample time for lawmakers to think of something more substantial.  I feel that bitcoin.com is probably just being the messenger here.

Sorry for the late reply.
Fairly widespread, but definitely not at the same level is Japan.  In terms of trading, bithumb will sometimes have the top volume for ETH.  Koreans love etherem; when Vitalik came here, over 1000 people rsvp'ed his meetup.

Thank you for your constructive input.  We'll make note of it.

So the Korean crypto/blockchain community are trying to fight the ICO ban.  One way is through an official petition to the President.  If you could please in your spare time sign it, we would really appreciate it.  Just click on the link above, and I included the petition address in the image description, as well as the 2-steps you need to take to sign the petition.  Every vote counts!

**Full disclosure: I am a part of Bitcoin Center Korea**
I am not that new to the cryptocurrency scene, so I don't know if I can make a full-formed decision/opinion about the topic yet.  For me personally I think its gonna be a losing game for the gov't in Korea.  What do you guys think?
