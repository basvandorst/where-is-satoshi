Not likely but also not impossible. Either way it's going up.

Amazing work, thanks for sharing. I've used TunnelBear and FrootVPN in the past year, but now I'm out of subscription and am thinking whether to renew or to switch. If you are still looking (LOL) please update us with what you think is the most viable option. Thanks again! :-)

This is great, thanks for sharing! I took the liberty to write about it on my blog:

This would make a good beginning, but by the time we need to have enforcement agents (to replace the military) we would probably end up with AI driven droids. That could go south fast.
The future is nigh?

Congratulations man! I reached 21 a while ago too and am now keeping it in an untouchable wallet that I wouldn't spend until BTC hits 4 or 5 figures in the (hopefully) near future :D

Well whatever you do, sounds like a good starting point to me. Lest one gets corrupted before. PM me if you care to share more information. I'm keen to get into the circle.

The writer is based in Chiang Mai. Anyone who left the West to find peace in the East is likely more level headed than most of us. Plus he's not all in the "craze" so he could have a better perspective. Just saying.

A long while back ago, I decided that everyone is stupid, and stopped to expect anything from anyone (even recognition, attention, etc.). I think coders would be happier if they were to adapt similar attitude towards their users.

I never believed CW for a second, but I came to wonder, where's the real Satoshi throughout all this? Why didn't he speak up? It sure would have helped.
@_date: 2016-05-02 08:45:14
Is it just me or did everybody miss that he could simply email everyone from Satoshi's email too?

This is why our society is broken. Good people are... good. Therefore they stay poor. And bad people are... bad. Hence they get rich. The banks wouldn't flinch for a second and pretend that money is gone. Kudos to you, I would have done the same, but maybe we should rethink "goodness" for once.

Good job, very creative! Thanks for sharing! :-)
