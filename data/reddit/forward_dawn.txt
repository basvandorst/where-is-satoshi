Informative. But now I think LN is a retarded solution.

It seems too much of a hassle with having to open LN with everyone, or relying on mid-nodes having the cash. There’s a lot of things that are minor that just add up to me. Hey, maybe it’ll turn out that I’m wrong and it’s great. I certainly hope so. But for now I’m just not sold.

Did you even read my fucking post? I said hedge against inflation.
@_date: 2018-05-14 05:32:48
*Fiat* currency. Not money in general.
Bitcoin isn’t a hedge against inflation. Precious metals are.

I dunno dude, there’s plenty of entrepreneurs in bitcoin.

Cause he’s an opportunist leech who leeched off of Andrew Breitbart until he died, then leeched on to Trump. He didn’t do anything good for them, Bannon was leaking shit to the press while in the White House, and then stabbed his host in the back after he was removed.
I’m the words of Trump, “Sloppy Steve”

Infrastructure is a tiny part of government spending, generally. Most of it goes to redistribution of wealth. Quality of life is not tied to how much the government steals from you by force, but by the ethic and culture of the people. And secondarily, by their economic freedom.

Luckily he won’t be able to afford drinking anymore. The guy never built anything on his own and made a living hanging around people who did.

Still waiting for someone to sell me on LN. It seems like a built-in version of loyalty accounts. Say if I go to a coffee shop and give them $100 for a card that gives me 40 coffees, that's more or less the same thing.
If I'm wrong please correct me.

I'll check out the video, and I'll be waiting for the response.
The mesh part is very interesting, but from what I know there might be problems with finding paths with sufficient balance. Not to mention that at some point, the off chain transactions would just replace the chain. Not sure if that's accurate, but hey feel free to school me.

Then have some states decide for themselves. Like, it’s also easier to convince one state than the whole country. I mean you can agree to this, right? That if people should be allowed to choose this at a state level. Another state, like Texas for example’s sake, doesn’t want to do it, why should they be forced to? Let’s say California does it and it goes well. That’s great, Texans would want to move to Cali since it would work so much better. I’m not particularly making any argument for or against here, just that the decisions should be made at a lower level and conform to what the actual people living there would want.

Medicare and medicaid subsidies are the majority of the healthcare costs. Then you have welfare and social security.
I mean, if you want a single payer system, I'd much rather see all the people on the left stop being authoritarians and forcing it nationwide, and let states decide. If a state with universal healthcare ends up being a better state, other states would have to do all they can to emulate it for their citizens, risking mass emigration. If it's a disaster, the whole country isn't feeling the results. This is what the United States system was supposed to be used as, state-wide or even lower level experiments. Not putting all your eggs in one basket.

Mostly the former, as that as a general rule for countries that have it, ends up being way higher than military spending. In the US, for example, welfare and entitlements (food stamps included) are 66% of the budget, while military is 17%.

What’s the difference between that, and the belief that you have to be an absolute backwards heretic to not believe in the divinity of Christ? Like, I don’t think you actually believe that. I’m just more for people making their own choices, even at state level. It’s more than just that, though. It’s also more practical to have it on the state level since:
1) you have more influence at the state than the federal government, so you can convince people easier
2) the state governments, being closer to the people, have a better idea of how to actually provide it, if they choose to do it
