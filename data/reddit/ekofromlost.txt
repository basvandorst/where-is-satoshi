This is a great way to see how shortsighted they are.  And how they are only interested in selling headlines instead of giving reliable information.

I agree with you but I don´t think those fees are the biggest problem.  At least not for an enthusiastic newcomer.
I really think we need a better User Experience.  Bitcoin is still too technical and difficult for the average Joe.
We need a "Netscape" to take off.  And we need a reliable webwallet.

So is wine.  The problem is that all politicians are moneyholics.  They want to spend more so they get more votes.  Soon the "good" inflation becomes huge and destroys the economy.
These half truths are pure demagogy.  Please refer to the book "Ecomonics in one lesson" to break down more of these half truths.

I'm curious as how one can profit from having one of these.  I'm interested in importing one into Brazil.
Is that a percentage on transactions?  How much do they charge?

Truth be told.  Apple will open the door to a new world of payment methods.  It was due to start at any moment now with the available technologies.
Bitcoin, hopefully, will surf this wave with android/google.  I don't see BTC being popular with the way we deal with it nowadays.  Pay an exchange, waiting for it and then transfering to your own wallet.  It has to be seamless.  And Apple is introducing the concept.
Today was a good day.  One step forward in new tech based forms of payment.

While I agree about the merchant adoption for now, I disagree about the convention.  Bitcoin will develop randomly, like the internet.  Try to plan It and you will have people trying to control It (power struggle) and It's not going to work.
@_date: 2015-07-08 22:22:25


If you mean a technological discussion and consensus, I agree.  Those guys are essential to Bitcoin's future, like in our block size issue right now.
I meant a convention to deliberate the use of Bitcoin and Its applications.  Like: "Oh Bitcoin should be driven towards more merchant adoption" or "remittance usage".   That path we'll discover as new implementations arise and people get the most from them.

This is a sad ad for bitcoin.  It is way above that type of bs.  However It has to go though all these misunderstandings while the people and the media study and learn about the technology.

This is an Elephant in the room, that I hear so little about.
I think there is going to be a drop in prices, but only short term.  
What might happen is if the tools that are being developed  to track spent bitcoin are working at that moment we might be able to whom It went to.
@_date: 2017-05-17 11:04:34
Because people would realize that a lot of Bitcoins would inundate the market.  Too much offer x demand.
@_date: 2017-05-13 13:14:08
 &gt;it would be a good thing to either have those coins re-distributed (Satoshi selling) 
I agree completely.
What's the Bitcoin-eater?  And Address your Bitcoins go to die?  Wht's the function of something like that? I never heard of It.
@_date: 2017-05-16 23:11:53
OK but why the hell would someone transfer bitcoin to that address?  It's just like throwing FIAT money on a bonfire, no?
@_date: 2017-05-16 23:10:05
oh ok 10 tps per channel is a different matter.  
@_date: 2017-05-13 12:56:16
Wait: how the hell is that significantly different from the 7 tx per second of the actual Bitcoin network?  A whooping 30% increase?
@_date: 2017-05-13 00:48:19
I agree.  This is an excellent post. I'm sure there's a lot of early people here that are starting to think about when to realize the profit.  He also sold at a good price in a very tumultuous time.  We have no idea what will happen with bitcoin.  We have an important tech stalemate and an immoral censorship in this subreddit.  It is what It is.  Bitcoin will survive, of course, but no one can call the moon launch.   In that regard op sold well, and kept 50%.  Wise decision.

And they are not because blocks have 1 Mb size limit, and there has been a "strong debate" in the community that the block size should be increased to 2 mb, or 4mb or 8mb instantly, while the other size arguments that bigger blocks will require more bandwidth and would centralize power on the hands of those people/countries that had faster internet bandwidths.  
While the "strong debate"doesn't come to any conclusions, the Bitcoin Network is having a hard time dealing with the growth of number of transactions (read: not scaling ahead of the demand), and the only option for the user is to increase the transaction fee to over one dollar so It will skip the huge line of transactions piling up, or wait too damn long for your transaction to confirm, maybe for hours even.
And we were promised there would be instant transactions, with practically zero fees.

I donated to [Greenpeace]( just to show my wife and my friends how easy It is to use Bitcoins.  It's a win/win.
[Doctors without borders]( also had a campaign that accepted BTC, but now that the campaign is over I can't donate to them anymore.
For two buck you can show people how It works an watch them go like: "That's It???"

*But, the general public have the freedom to participate in Bitcoin trading as a commodity trading on the internet on the condition they carry their own risk.*
That goes for the transfer of bitcoins between two people, of course.  
Transfering bitcoins = paying for products and services, is it not?
@_date: 2017-06-15 13:23:14
Think about It this way:  YOU have some Bitcoin now.  Look out the window at all those people out there that don't have any.  Price doesn't matter, now.  YOU have some Bitcoin.  When they want some, price will be massive.  But It may take a couple of years, maybe.

Yes, because It will be the opposite of the decentralized, banking for the unbanked, peer to peer money that Satoshi created.  It will be a medium of payment reachable only by those that can afford It.
@_date: 2017-06-30 02:06:29
I've come to the point of *moon or bust*.  
If you think about It, there's zero chance of Bitcoin becoming a mediocre thing.  It's either disruptive and going to the moon, or something will happen that will make It bust.  Every country on earth declares It illegal, a major flaw in the network; miners, developers, or another group of people getting control over It, *something* like that or a Black Swan.
Since I'm pretty far away from retiring with the little BTC I have I've decided I will not cash out until It's landed on the moon.
But that is not an easy decision.  This game requires ball of steel.
@_date: 2017-06-08 12:12:27
That's how you kill Bitcoin.  The idea of money for people, with lower costs exactly because there's no middle man.   
I'm all for Segwit, LN, AND Blocksize increase, but let's not get into that, please.
The point is Usability.  Make It above 20 USD and mom and Dad will prefer something much more reliable (to them) like Paypal or Western Union.  Litecoin, Monero, Dash will rise to be the most popular transfer of money between people.
@_date: 2013-12-05 17:53:04
If it cannot be used as a financial tool but can be used as a means of payment between people, why not?
The whole text was too vague to make an objective understanding (at least in my point of view) as to what can or cannot be done with bitcoin.  I would more than welcome your understanding of it.
@_date: 2017-06-09 03:24:02
Peer to peer means people to people, not people - centralized authority with x% cut - people.
Of course mining does not equal centralization, but the circumstance we find ourselves in today means that the mining fee equals that x% centralized authority cut.
The point is: Bitcoin will be useful only for those that can afford to use It.
