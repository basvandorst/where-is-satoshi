I agree with everything you said, except for the part about GEORGE SOROS not being in the illuminati

Literally the day they announced futures on bitcoin the price rose 20%. I don't see how this is bad at all

"Heckin whales amirite???"
The price rose because there was interest
@_date: 2018-01-17 23:25:33
DOGE was at 2 billion dollars and DENTACOIN was 1 billion. You really think the market wasn't overvalued just a bit? Not to mention BCC and TRX 
I know the whale hate feels good, but be honest. Was that really healthy and sustainable growth?

if Hal was indeed Satoshi, then he went through great lengths in the early days to make it seem unlikely. including having email conversations with himself. he may have thought he wouldn't even be suspect if he did send himself the first bitcoin tx. none of this can be proven, as far as we know he was just a person Satoshi trusted
@_date: 2018-09-02 01:01:56
and his nearby neighbor was named [Dorian Satoshi Nakamoto](

you sold 10BTC yesterday and got 11BTC today. that yielded more bitcoin, no?
@_date: 2018-08-02 23:23:34
iirc, the white paper says nothing about block limits. Satoshi made the block limit in order to contain a risk, and did it incognito. due to the code being open source, many saw that the block limit was introduced. Satoshi him/her/themselves even asked the ones who first discovered it to keep it on the down low. 
Satoshi planned on removing the block limit eventually but not at the time of writing the whitepaper since there was no limit
edit: this has nothing to do with consensus, which *IS* laid out clearly in the whitepaper

"Does anybody think that maybe in November the bulls manipulated the price upwards and made way more money when a mass migration of people entered the market and bought in at prices 50x higher than they paid?"
Didn't see that very often lol

This is true, or to dollar cost average over time. Personally I think that this is the best strategy but there's no reason to discredit TA. Most people would recommend to stay away from day trading anyway, especially of you're an amateur

The people who did this in January could have bought at 6k though. There's really no perfect answer, only changing the odds

The ATH of Litecoin is $375




Litecoin had a much more public launch than bitcoin did, people could mine with a laptop potato. Charlie Lee probably didn't have the opportunity to ever mine as many as 5% total supply of LTC like Satoshi.
He basically had the same opportunity as any miner, and deserves to profit from his LTC. I'm sure if he sold at $50 the same people who complain specifically about ATH would be making fun of him for selling so low




@_date: 2018-10-25 14:27:51
It's more like on reddit, only positive TA ever gets upvoted to the top. How many times has the "BTC is falling to 4k" comment been ridiculed as FUD or just completely ignored this year. That was in TA in January, and people here just do NOT want to hear it. So many people joined between Nov-Jan last year and just dont understand or cant fully comprehend the monumental rise in 2017. 
@_date: 2018-10-11 20:21:21
Your realize he is saying that 1% of 2,070 altcoins = 20. He isn't talking about the year 2070
@_date: 2018-10-08 15:07:32
Nobody is telling you not to. But your claim that they never paid out is false. If you never received your money then you need to figure that out, or sue 
@_date: 2018-10-20 02:04:00
If it makes you feel better, they're an extremely toxic T_D aficionado who enjoys calling people retarded, so your life is probably better no matter how much money they have :)

You realize you're in a forum full of people that think the USD will implode and banks across the world will burn because of them, right?

Since so many people in this sub will give you the ancap go-to response, here is an actual explanation










It's similar to poker strategy. There is no chance of you winning every hand, no matter if you are the world champ. But over 100, 200 hands, they can win more than if they had used no strategy
@_date: 2018-10-24 20:05:12
I'm pretty sure that everybody agrees that TA does not belong in lottery....so you're definitely right. I dont see how that applies here though

If you are in crypto, for some reason not using TA made your purchase not a gamble?

If you can't tell it's a scam then I hope you learn from this. If anybody tells you to send them money so they can send you money, don't fucking do it

I remember when they did their AMA years ago, people were saying the same thing about bias. These guys were advocating huge gains in value back when it was $9 and they are still doing it now at $8,000. They have always put their money where their mouth is. Everybody is biased in some way, but i believe them when they say they believe these things
@_date: 2018-02-02 14:58:09
