It’s making me check my phone every 5 minutes. It’s actually starting to piss me off lol

What do you mean with “keep your wallets ready?”
@_date: 2017-12-09 08:16:43
Because you are obviously clueless.
@_date: 2017-12-01 09:28:35
@_date: 2017-12-06 16:53:23
Because Coinbase will be down. Question in the side, how would I sell quickly if my Bitcoin is on a paper wallet?
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:23:03
Tell them to get a bread wallet and send them money on Christmas Day 
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:18:40
How would I buy more with just my wallet and not using an exchange?

They should have sent you two small amounts of money to your account. In verification they will ask for these two amounts.

They have a number you can call +1 (888) 908-7930

Which exchange do you use to seamlessly swap your investment in  BTC over to Alts?
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:10:51
Interesting read, please choose a better title to post next time. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:30:52
You better believe I do! And in some cases it might be less money to come and live in Germany for a year instead of paying the man.

Is this sub being moderated at all?
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:45:03
Thanks man! ����
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:28:33
Can you please explain those?
@_date: 2017-12-16 21:38:51
Man the thing with the key backups is so super awesome man! Your family will quite literally /s shit a brick! I’d hold you if I wasn’t on mobile. Merry Xmas.

I tipped my cab driver. Fees were higher than the tip though xD
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:41:42
What do you mean?

Could you please explain how you got scammed with Blockchainwallet?
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:41:10
If you send them Bitcoin, best let them just dl bread wallet.
@_date: 2017-12-08 11:48:52
I don’t even feel this sub is being moderated at all. I wish it was.
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:24:45
No IRS where I live plus here (Germany) you don’t have to tax gains on bitcoin which you’ve been holding for more than a year.
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:20:22
I think you should give them an amount high enough that it surpasses the fee you will be paying. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 13:43:13
You can try using GDAX to get it out, it uses the same account information as Coinbase. Transfer to GDAX and then try taking it from there. Although you will need to go through an extra verification process. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:23:44
If they have iOS devices bread wallet will work fine. It’s UI is also very user friendly.
@_date: 2017-12-08 13:32:35
How is this not being auto-removed?
@_date: 2017-12-09 08:21:26
You are literally just repeating information you recently picked up. There is no news nor insight to you post.

Who is this Andreas guy everyone is always going on about? Is he something like Bitcoin Jesus?
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:50:15
I second this! Please remind me!
@_date: 2017-12-09 13:11:00
I’m just interested in getting into IOTA, Litecoin and Monero besides BTC, currently I am on Coinbase and GDAX respectively. Whereas the latter is still needing passport confirmation. Will these be sufficient to invest in these alts? Which other alt coins do you consider reading into?
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:52:30
As a resident of Germany which one would you recommend? I was setting up GDAX but then my Passport was expired..so my entry is delayed by a good fortnight. Until then I guess I’ll just continue buying via Coinbase.
@_date: 2017-11-21 16:36:11
Coinbase was very easy.
@_date: 2017-11-19 19:55:28
Why does it matter?
@_date: 2017-11-17 02:00:19
Can I get in line somewhere?

Check out the Ten X card.

This is ridiculous. What are you even on about?

The first Transaction takes longer. Once you have a fully verified account it takes 1 work day.
@_date: 2018-03-11 03:29:35
That’s the crypto time distortion
