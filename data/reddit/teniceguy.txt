Nothing surprising about that above 100% debt to gdp ratio. And since most people measure debt with that number, debt will grow faster than gdp.

It's a lot easier to just buy btc. Unless you have a few solar panels at home, it's probably not gonna worth it.

When btc moons it will worth it. Just not as much as if he just bought btc today. Assuming he doesnt sell as soon as possible.
@_date: 2019-11-14 11:34:20
Yep, if i had to take a bet, boomers have more btc than milennials since they are the ones who can afford even 
"useless shit" that their grandkids convinced them about.

Yeah but there is a painful side of this aswell. You can't expect these people to cooperate. Yeah it's difficult to explain shit to dumb people but if you manage, then you can reach your goals much faster.

Moon confirmed.

Predicting BTC short term is pretty much impossible and buying the dip is nothing more than a noob trap and meme. Just decide how much you wanna spend on BTC and buy it any day. I bought for pretty much 5% of my total money because i have trust in BTC but im also very conservative about investments.

Wow this logic is genius!
@_date: 2019-11-14 13:44:14
He is better off, thats what i said. But still better than not owning at all.

Famous last words.

I refuse to believe these politicians are that dumb. I think they are just trying to demonize MZ for "attacking" the dollar.
@_date: 2019-10-28 09:29:01
So nothing would change on that part.
@_date: 2019-10-25 11:29:45
What are trees grandpa?
@_date: 2019-10-31 08:15:22
lol what? Did you just assume we stop hodling?
@_date: 2019-10-03 14:27:30
So basically fees.
@_date: 2019-10-30 09:55:20
Can i call deflation bitcoinary?
@_date: 2019-12-30 14:24:52
Like that's not what's already happening.
@_date: 2019-12-05 12:21:02
Sold AND bought. For any currency.
@_date: 2019-12-19 14:09:50
Finally someone who really understands how TA works! Good job!
@_date: 2019-12-05 10:06:27
It was a sarcastic answer. OP's question a little stupid. Everything is "manipulated".
@_date: 2019-12-30 15:01:33
wow what a surprise, one of the billion bullshit predictions almost came true
@_date: 2019-12-04 12:38:59
I was like 11 when i asked my mom how money was created. She said the government printed it. I was confused as fuck how people can trust this shit when pretty much everyone hates politicians because of their untrustworthiness.
But to your question: It is backed by the complex structure of economy.
Hopefull you werent expecting an answer like "gold". Because gold isnt backed by anything either. Gold has no value in itself. Same with (fiat) money. Money is just a store of value so you dont have to bring all your sheep/corn with you when you want to exchange it.
@_date: 2019-12-30 14:22:51
Oh no. People might actually become free.
@_date: 2019-12-03 13:04:07
1 BTC.
@_date: 2019-09-25 14:33:34
Okay, this could be a good question aswell. Why would it go much higher than the minimum cost?
@_date: 2019-09-25 14:21:55
The Shining.
@_date: 2019-09-25 11:37:23
Okay i really need an explanation. Why the hell would BTC go much higher than it costs to mine, which is around 6,5k usd average?
@_date: 2019-09-25 14:02:15
Wrong subreddit
@_date: 2019-09-27 08:17:48
Keep buying it until it becomes 10% of your portfolio... am i right?
