Why is it so goddamn hostile then? I know art audiences, I studied visual culture, but this does not even allow for the possibility of blockchain being a good force. It begins with the assumption that it is some kind of neoliberal force that is sweeping into the art world. It is so critical that it could not possibly be about bringing them toward crypto. 
I mean in what kind of fantasy world is this even reasonable?
'The permanence and irrevocable automation of blockchain systems wedded to the irrationality and sweep of techno-financial hybrids has led to forecasts ranging from 'fully automated luxury communism', to our ultimate cryptological enslavement to machines, or the collapse of time itself, as the feature of algorithms to make-happen overtakes the temporal concerns of flesh and earth.'
I would fail a first year for writing claptrap like that.

This is the dumbest thing I have ever read.

One followup: will a wallet spend *every* input every time? 
Also is there a reason Satoshi picked this method? My guess was that it was the most efficient means to get things done, but then I also wondered if it might lead to people being able to associate wallets with transactions easier.

Awesome, thanks.

He means your description of bitcoin/blockchain and even your sociological and political position are ignorant. It is not as if one cannot recognise that there are critical viewpoints. It is just that there is no attempt at that here beyond tired and frankly freshman-esque critical theory blended with some kind of tired attempt at writing like Virilio. It's just bad. That is what we are saying.

Man that is lame.
