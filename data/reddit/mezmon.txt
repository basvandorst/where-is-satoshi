What is the point of theses posts at this point? They don't provide any new or valuable info. Bitcoin is probably* here to stay... we get it already. Any coin exsists until it doesn't. Truth is yah, bitcoin has the longest track record being first and all but Ethereum has flourished since it first came into existence. I'm not valuing one over the other I'm just pointing out that there isn't much value added just by stating " been here the longest so its the best". 
@_date: 2018-05-01 21:07:13
Nope, I don't want anything. I just direct my own personal energy in directions I believe have the potential to align with my own beliefs. Otherwise just stating an opinion based on personal observation. These days though people seem to receive opinion as the gospel truth.  
@_date: 2018-05-01 18:48:36
F*ck big industry coming in and trying to manipulate crypto. Don't give two shits if people think this is good. These a-holes eventually poison anything they touch. Bitcoin was suppose to be the solution to big bank manipulation. So ironic that some in the community get all hot and bothered the more they get involved
@_date: 2018-05-03 15:05:37
"In coming time"... Lol. Technical analysis should shut up... its really starting to embarrass itself
@_date: 2018-05-24 02:12:08
Technically we didn't need it to "see" the correlation but I suppose the complied data affirms the hypothesis
@_date: 2018-05-01 20:55:49
Oh, I understand it but thank you for your input my dear but I am not referring to its intrinsic use...I am taking about the manipulation practices big banks and large institutions have a historical track record of implementing. 
@_date: 2018-06-25 20:56:47
No reason to feel sorry because I actually value personal experience a lot. It's why my world view leads me to point out through discussion when its represented without an underscore of "this is only my opinion but in my experience etc ..."
Opinion presented as fact is a big problem right now. I suppose what I'm getting at is fact is true in all cases where as opinion varies. 
Maybe you didn't mean to but your original post (the idea that all btc investors are intelligent) came off presented as fact (true in all cases). If the interpretation was misaligned...for that I apologize.  
No need for luck but I appreciate the sentiment!
@_date: 2018-06-25 16:57:14
Ah, so fueled only through personal bias? These proclamations are the ones that bother me most in crypto, stating something as fact when its nothing more then a opinion. Also, using "common sense" as a argument has no real substance here either. 
@_date: 2018-06-25 17:37:11
I could ask the same of you? Regardless, world view is not fact outside of your own head. Without data to back a claim it has no substance. By resorting to a personal attack I seemed to have offended you though so i don't expect thoughtful discussion from here on out. 
@_date: 2018-06-20 20:07:36
But I can use almost any altcoin in exchage for goods and services exactly like i can with btc. As long as there is a willing participant to exchage. So far this is the only meaningful use for bitcoin correct? Am i missing something? And before you all freak out I'm asking this as a legit question.  
@_date: 2018-06-21 03:57:07
Technicalities don't seem to be your forte but participation trophy none the less!
@_date: 2018-06-20 21:02:11
No I'm not. I have actually used alt coins aside from btc to buy real world things. 
@_date: 2018-06-25 19:34:10
You called me an idiot for countering your claim and its now logged in this thread. That's called data my friend. 
A valid observation can be limited by the scope of the data set and therefore limit its validity. Have you met every btc in the world to be able to claim they are all intelligent?
 
To some, sky diving is terrifying and not at all exciting. I've met many who claim this. It is personal bias.
Some don't feel a equal type of pain to a bee sting. I've witnessed someone step on a bee and didn't even know. So they can be painful but not always. 
People usually scream in agony when shot by a bullet. We generally know this through collected evidence in recordings or by doctors testimonies.  That's data based evidence.  
Staring at bright lights when I wake up doesn't hurt my eyes. Might be something you should get checked out but youll insist that there is more to it then that so the evidence beyond personal perspective for discomfort related to bright light would be that people tend to squint in that situation. Anyone, regardless of opinion can witness this happen. That too would be data driven evidence. 
I know quite few btc investors who got in based on fomo this year alone and then freaked out and only to sell at a loss. The data for that is scattered in forums all over the internet. Personally, I wouldn't define that as intelligent and I certainly wouldn't use a claim such as "I think everyone here is smart because they are doing the same thing i am and I've yet to meet a dumb one so everything is gonna work out!" to define why a investment may be worthwhile. 
I mean... You claim I am an idiot and I'm here and invested in btc AND may have been a investor much longer then you even. 
Here's something for ya:
"Anecdotal evidence is evidence from anecdotes, i.e., evidence collected in a casual or informal manner and relying heavily or entirely on personal testimony. ... Accurate determination of whether an anecdote is typical requires statistical evidence."
Source: 
If you don't get it you probably won't but my point is you presented something as fact that is nothing more then speculation. 
@_date: 2018-06-25 15:43:11
Any actual proof of this or data to back this claim?

I miss the islands. Moved away 8 years ago. Hiking the pill boxes then jumping in the ocean is the best way to start a day

When nothing else to add go after the grammer eh? You understood the point, why not address the issue directly?
@_date: 2018-06-18 02:03:28
Yup! 
@_date: 2018-06-20 21:27:49
Are we now taking about perceived relevance or use case?? Many altcoins have a perceived relevance to their holders even if not from a majority perspective. 
Even with altcoins, transactions are still verified and logged on their blockchain. Btcs' only use case so far is as a means of exchanging something of perceived value securely without requiring outside 3rd party validation to verify that the thing of stated value is legitimate.  The use case for btc is still exactly the same as when it was first exchanged for 2 pizzas in a very similar scenerio.  Thats exactly what many (not all but many) altcoins can also accomplish.
@_date: 2018-06-21 14:20:49
Yes, mainly due to context. How exactly does camel shit verify itself as a trustless means of exchanging value?? Your comparison isn't clever, it's just lazy and not thought out being that its irrelevant to what is being discussed here. By starting it youre completely ignoring the fundamentals that made btc a powerful tool for exchage in the first place. Those fundamentals exsist with altcoins as well. Unfortunately, camel shit doesn't share those fundamentals. 
Just like the baseball card analogy the other person posted its a pointless comparison because we all know that the power of blockchain (btc and altcoins) is trustless verification.You're trying to compare apples with shit. Sure, you could eat both and call them food but what the apples provides is far more beneficial due to you know...nutrition! Btc vs alts at this point is like comparing apples vs oranges. They both provide different types of nutrition but can sustain health none the less. The choice then comes down to preference. 
@_date: 2018-03-20 15:21:46
Top 5-10 are only there because they got into their game first. Doesnt mean they are the best at doing what they claim they can.  
@_date: 2018-03-20 19:06:38
In this brand new and constantly evolving crypto space I'd beg to differ that everything possibly matters. 
@_date: 2018-03-16 06:44:02
Stupid article
@_date: 2018-03-22 21:01:07
Let's just be clear what the articles are taking about is child porn! If you're going to reference something at least address the true connotation of what the issue is. I'm not trying to spread the FUD but child porn found anywhere, especially if placed there with intent in any way shape or form is completely unacceptable and is something that should be taken seriously. 
@_date: 2018-03-17 17:01:13
Posting fake information? The OP just asked a question. Lol
@_date: 2018-03-21 00:11:03
But a network with great tech wont have only 4 people lol this isnt a valid argument 
@_date: 2018-03-20 19:16:51
True but so does intelligent design and execution. All I'm getting at is everything is very much so in its infancy. Declaring anything that isn't currently in the top 10 a shitcoin is a huge mistake based on how new everything is in crypto. 
@_date: 2018-03-20 15:48:37
@_date: 2018-03-20 18:36:12
 Not trolling and also not specifically referencing bitcoin. Original post i was replying to referenced the top 5-10 coins so my comment was in reference to the top 5-10.
@_date: 2018-03-20 15:23:22
Like painting a huge target on your place! Appreciate the skill though 
@_date: 2018-03-20 15:45:34
Yeah, throwing money randomly at anything is never a good idea but doing proper research and trying to find the 5% that are worth investing in is worth the time in my opinion. 
@_date: 2018-07-02 20:44:41
I suppose i see the investing side of bitcoin as people hedging their wealth into what they believe will be the future of transaction. As time goes on, even though currently we don't transact with btc very often the value of btc will continue to rise. When general adoption of btc takes over people will no longer be using btc as a investment but instead for day to day transactions. "Investing" in btc at the moment is just about trying to get ahead of the curve. Btc probably won't adjust in price much when the equilibrium between investing in it and transacting with it shifts into transacting but everyone will either recognize 1 btc as being worth trading for a gallon of milk or a 2bd house... who knows but the recognition of that value will be set. 
@_date: 2018-07-06 03:40:46
Lack of legit goals and an inability to create something of value themselves

Hasn't been my experience. Maybe if i had got into btc back in 2014-2015 but "other crypto" has been far more rewarding ;)
@_date: 2018-07-02 22:20:26
It was just a example but yes the probability is for much better then a gallon of milk. Hence the delta of milk to small house! I try not to pretend I know the future. Also, total supply will be 21 million for the timeframe I'm referring to.

 It's probably because those with real applicable development knowledge are too busy actually applying thier knowledge to crypto development lol
@_date: 2018-04-25 15:47:36
 So what would you call what just happen to bitcoin in the last 24hrs?? Looks a lot like a pump and dump to me. To be clear, i support bitcoin but only in the long run. To pretend that pumping and dumping doesn't happen with bitcoin also is just silly. 
@_date: 2018-04-17 03:36:18
Seriously, I support bitcoin fully but the only thing that kept me from getting into crypto in the first place were all the bitcoin cheerleaders who refused to even discuss the possibly of imperfections. The bias is still off putting

I'm very suprised no one has mentioned the word "shit coin" yet here!?! Seems like anything that references coins other then bitcoin automatically gets that connotation round these parts!

My alts brought my portfolio back to its previous high from 3 months ago.  Mind you 3 months ago bitcoin was between 11k-13k. Investing in random alts with no legit research behind the investment is just dumb but there are good alt coin investments out there. Don't let the general bias from here lead you to believe anything other then bitcoin is crap. Just don't go out and invest in some random alt just because you see it grow 2-3 times in a week.
@_date: 2018-04-24 05:29:31
Stupid ass whoever did it and shame on OP for thinking this is something worth sharing in promotion of bitcoin. Being from Hawaii myself this is serious haole attitude right here.
