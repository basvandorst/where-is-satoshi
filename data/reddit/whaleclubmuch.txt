I've been giving him the benefit of the doubt ever since they signed that piece of paper.... Now i feel like a retard trusting them. They better provide by July 2016 or else i will start trolling everything Luke is saying.

I will refresh your memory then. Check this out:
Closing statements: 
Based on the above points, the timeline will likely follow the below dates.
SegWit is expected to be released in April 2016.
The code for the hard-fork will therefore be available by July 2016.

Do you see your name there?

ahm so this is what he;s been replying to me: No, I don't recall any paper ( talking about the HK Agreement ) . The quote you're citing is from an estimated projection based on the agreement terms (and expected Segwit release date, which was quite far off the reality), not part of the agreement itself.
I'm out dude. The dipshits are nothing but lying sons of... All hail our new Overlords.

Yes they do when the very thing they are keeping secure has a backlog of 45mb. Maybe you shouldn't worry so much about miners and go back to coding that HF you promised will be made available at the beginning of July. Or was Core lying about that?

;) All hail our Overlords

Welcome to the artificial fee market. We will get rid of this when we get rid of Blockstream. Tune in in about half a year.

Do you remember signing a piece of paper saying: "The code for the hard-fork will therefore be available by July 2016."
Am i missing something over here? Because everybody trusted you guys and now it seems you are not doing anything in that regard.
@_date: 2016-06-27 21:30:27
Reading Lukes comments makes me think they see this agreement as a joke. I don't think they are going to release code for this HF. I am officially panicking :S
@_date: 2016-06-27 22:06:03
So no HF code? Let us know like a man. Don't hide like a politician.

"Bitcoin used to be an open-source project, but it sure doesn't look like it these days."
+1 from me. well spoken.

Once again he proves he's the bigger man. i'm on. let;s bury the hatchet and do this
@_date: 2016-05-07 17:22:50
well i think this answers the good ol' question: "Should i get into mining some Bitcoin?"
@_date: 2016-05-26 11:39:39
Burn baby burnnnnn
@_date: 2016-05-04 22:50:56
I use Circle quite a lot. Good job guys
@_date: 2016-05-07 19:42:26
You;re right. I think about it like the Gold was when you could buy it cheap. If Bitcoin is to succeed it will be a long game

@_date: 2016-05-07 20:00:26
Yeah man there is just something that does not add up. The guy seems to be too smart for this kind of mumbo jumbo. I can't wait to see how this will unfold
@_date: 2016-05-07 23:49:41
I don;t know man. I'm not saying that you're not right but there;s something fishy here.

You need to learn how to sync faster. I did a sync a couple of weeks ago and it took less than a day with txindex=1. so maybe you need to replace your potato computer... just a thought.

bought yesterday. expecting it to fail now :))
