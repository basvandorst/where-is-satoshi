21.co's innovation has nothing at all to do with surreptiously mining a bunch of bitcoins for 21.co to sell on the open market.  Who in their right mind can think that even 10 billion 21.co chips mining for a few minutes a day could seriously compete with the existing (and of course, future, larger and ever-more powerful) data-center 24/7 mining operations. It's like someone suggesting that with the right chip in 500 million cell phones you could replicate Google's data center operations. Ridiculous.
21.co's chips have everything to do with with enabling entirely new payment models across not hundreds, but thousands of different industries.
Give away a free cell phone that is able to bill its user accurate and cheaply (low or effectively zero transaction cost, compared to credit card) on a *per call made,* and *per-kilobyte-used* basis. 
The revolution in the chip is NOT the fact that it mines, per-se -- as a mining device it will be so-so at best. It is the fact that if it is successful, it will be a *ubiquitous* and *trustworthy* method for any manufacturer (and app programmer as well) to track and bill for value in any abitrary increment at almost no cost. Down to single library or sub-routine operations within blocks of code, i.e. anyone will be able to do billing the way Amazon does with AWS, on a per IOP basis.  
It will explode in possibilities for new revenue models the same way smart phones have exploded with possibilities for new revenue models. (I.e. imagine concepts like Uber, Lyft, etc. 15 years ago.. no go. Today: worth billions, and speedily wiping out the established taxi industry with far-superior service.)

Hmm, I didn't read the analysis closely enough.
Perhaps on bitcoin's development roadmap there is already a cadre of devs who are ready to move the max # of decimals from 8 out to 15 or more, so that a bitcoin can be divided further, down to milli-satoshis, microsatoshis, etc.
The $USD exchange value of the tokens doesn't matter, what matters is that the backbone of the network for exchanging them is ubiquitous, secure, durable, transparent, and open-source.

By my reasoning, the 21.co chips won't need to mine the minimum main-chain bitcoin transaction fee to be useful.
[See my other comment] ( -- it makes no sense to publish billions of $0.00000021 USD value transactions to a permanent globally-available ledger.  They will use some sort of sidechain or off-chain processing for the tiny transactions, and just use the main blockchain for major settlement on an hourly, daily, or weekly basis.

A lot of redditors are completely missing the point of 21's business model.
This has **NOTHING** to do with competing with industrial scale mining, and **EVERYTHING** to do with connecting billions of devices to a globally-available, secure microtransaction-capable ledger that will enable entirely new categories of commerce on the Internet.
Basically, it is opening up the MASSIVE territory of all transactions with value less than a few $USD equivalent, which are currently totally impractical due to authentication issues (entering paypal / credit card numbers, CVCs, addresses, etc.) and transaction costs.
As this little analysis (quoted below) shows, the cost for any given device to mine *tens of thousands* of satoshis, which can then be stored indefinitely &amp; used as needed, is almost zero. (10% of ONE battery charge -- not 10% of every day battery usage on the device!)  
Even solar-powered devices will *easily* be able to mine as many satoshis as they require. The satoshis will be used as auth and transaction tokens for an unimaginably wide array of new use cases.
IF companies buy in on 21.co's ideas and chips, this will be on a par with the iPhone (and the ensuing growth of the whole multi-billion-dollar ecosystem of apps that now go with it &amp; Android) in terms of scale and significance.
21.co won't make a red cent on actually *mining bitcoin* - they are not out to compete with industrial scale mining. They will make billions on the *sale &amp; licensing costs* of each little device chip. And, as with the iPhone (and Android of course,) thousands of other companies will build on 21.co's bitcoin infrastructure to use micropayments to generate heretofore impossible revenue streams.
IF the tech works and the bitcoin network continues to grow (SCALE, baby, SCALE) -- "this is gentlemen."

Downvoted for sheer ridiculousness.

Automated warranty registration - the chipID is linked to your purchase records / contact info / email address at time of purchase. 
Machine tells you (via email or whatever) when it is due for normal maintenance such as replacing belts or needing bearing lubrication.
Possibly not just after a set time -- but intelligently, based on usage, i.e. number of cycles run through it.
Also, that is a big value-add for the manufacturer because they get warranty info on all their equipment accurately (to the exact date of purchase) for calculating when it expires / whether it's valid. Also potentially allows them to do much more sophisticated statistical analysis of failure modes / defective parts, etc. 
Maybe you sit back with the cynical angle -- why would the manufacturer even care that much, it's in their interest to have equipment fail, planned obsolence, etc. etc. But wait, what if there's a string of failures due to one particular part from a supplier being defective. Accurate info on those failures (facilitated by provable tracking thru the bitcoin network / uniqueID) could be used to strengthen a lawsuit against the supplier for the defective part.
This already occurs for huge equipment like jet engines (automated telemetry &amp; stats on a per-unique-unit basis,) -- the bitcoin angle would be to make it extremely cheap and ubiquitous, affordable at the retail/consumer level.
This particular use-case I describe isn't so much about actual monetary exchange, but rather provable, secure linking of individual devices with an individual's (or organization's) identity. Think of it as replacing on-device passive RFID tag, which is single-purpose only, requires dedicated single-purpose reader equipment and your own local database for tracking -- with network-enabled tracking that is intelligent / responsive, can answer queries, etc.
How about a more directly monetary use-case:  You tell your washing machine how much and what kind of detergent(s) you use for a given load size. The machine knows how many loads you run, and knows what water level setting you use on each load. You authorize the machine (with a preset spending limit) to order more detergent (via Amazon, or a local retailer, or whatever) when you are approaching only 20% left of your remaining detergent.  May sound a little far-fetched at the moment, but spread across a lot of devices it could become handy, e.g. all the smoke detectors in your house -- new battery notifications / ordering.  Of course automobiles with their large array of various different regular maintenance needs.
And before someone starts whining about privacy / intrusiveness of "the internet of things," sorry, that's not my department. There's still plenty of BLM land up in Idaho and Montana, suggest you stake a claim and get busy on your log cabin.

That is a good point, an elementary one that 21.co has no doubt considered &amp; planned for.
Let's say a washing machine or a cell phone is "phoning home" on the bitcoin network for whatever reason. Is there any reason 100's of millions of such microtransactions *need* to be globally-visible on the main bitcoin block chain? Absolutely not, that would be a profligate waste comparable to publishing, say, the register receipts of every single McDonald's restaurant purchase in the Wall Street Journal *print* edition every day. Absurd.
Most likely there will be some kind of side-chain / gateway network, probably coordinated by 21.co initially but if they're smart, open-sourced in some way, that will handle microtransaction processing in an intelligent way considering the relative *lack* of importance of each little transaction.  No one in the world really cares about the value of each little $0.000000042 cent transaction individually -- but companies, organizations, and governments *will* care about the *collective* value of those transactions.
The point being that tying these transactions in some way (side chain / hashing / &lt;hand-waving goes here&gt; to the main bitcoin blockchain makes them secure, permanent, trustworthy -- and therefore valuable.
Let's say Maytag or Frigidaire wants to put 21.co chips in their washers -- at a cost of say, 50 cents a chip plus $2 royalties to 21.co, and then Maytag/Frigidaire/whoever installs 40 million chips in their washing machines over a period of 10 years.  They get a unique company identifier and either run an instance of some open-source software on their own cloud, OR interface with 21.co's server farm / API (depending on how 21.co structures this,) and those 40 million washing machines (or phones, or whatever) are all chatting through the satoshi network once every hour / week / month / whatever interval:  all those transactions would go through the sidechain and/or 21.co API and be summarized / hashed / &lt;hand waving goes here&gt; into a *single* settlement transaction that hits the main bitcoin blockchain *as often as needed given the size of the company and their volume of microtransactions.*  (Anywhere from hourly to monthly or longer.)
Note: the "hand waving goes here" part shows where I lack specific technical knowledge but believe there is a not-too-difficult solution ready to be developed (or perhaps already ready for deployment.)
Oh, and on a different note completely: security for these chips / devices / "microwallets" will not be a major issue because the actual value ($USD equivalent) they contain will be so small that on an individual basis they will add no additional incentive for hacking above and beyond what is already attractive about mobile devices. (The microwallets could even be limited to say 0.000001 BTC *max* capacity, in software or firmware.)
21.co has probably already come up with a mechanism to shut down vendor's installed base of chips in the event that that vendor's master private key (&lt;hand waving / multi-sig / etc.&gt;) is compromised, superseding the vendor's private key with 21.co's own master key that can be used to enable a forced firmware update, replacing the vendor's private key. (Also faciliates organizational changes such as the splitting / merging of corporate entities, etc.)

Bitcoin will be dead when the USD exchange rate drops below $10 and stays there for at least a couple of years. Until then, pronouncements of "death" are just speculation and perhaps hope. (If you're shorting it -- teehee.)
As far as other "Internet of Things" chips, sure, there's lots of competition out there in that space. Does any of it have a viable model for *monetizing* and transacting securely at global scale? The 21.co chip leverages the existing, and so far fairly well-proven bitcoin mining network to give those who purchase its chips an assurance that their products' communications and  transactions will continue to work on the bitcoin network for years and decades to come.
The bitcoin network itself, as we know, has *so* many potential uses that even if 90% of projected use cases never come to fruition, the success of the remaining 10% will ensure that bitcoin sticks around.

No, investors by and large are NOT ready -- which is why now is the time to buy. 
Once they are ready, the bandwagon will be going far too fast for most people to be able to hop on it.
