It may crash. It may go to the moon. He's aware. He's an adult, he's educated, and he made his own decision. 
I must've forgotten that you were here when he and I had hours upon hours of conversation about all of the risks associated with potentially losing his money.

I hope you're not real.  Good bot?

I can't stop laughing at your timing for this comment.

True! I've suggested that. His investment into BTC is 5% of his net worth. He is uninterested in selling. He's had the same job for 16 years and he's been investing into his retirement very consistently. He's 13 years older than I am.

It's all relative. To me, it's a lot of money. To him, it's his random gold investment from 2005 that he didn't care about. Good advice on your part though. I agree 100% and still do. He's lurking in this thread, so maybe seeing this will convince him to cash out his original investment. I honestly tried to get him to sell what he needed to get it back. He just tells me he wants more. He spent his Christmas bonus on more.

Yeah, it's embarrassing more than anything. We live and we learn. Nowhere gets you further in life than the school of hard knocks. Merry Christmas to you as well.

I posted this with the intention and hope that people will enjoy my humiliation and learn from it. Please laugh at my shortcomings, just don't make them your own. 
We have become mostly consumers (I'm talking about the U.S. here). We're just projected corporate numbers.
We crunch numbers each month on how to make it financially, typically while spending the most. 
Bitcoin is changing that. Or...Bitcoin is going to change that. 
At least I HOPE it will. 
We need to keep believing. We need to be a community. 
It's not about how many lambos you've bought (although I'm not a hater, and I want to see your lambos), it's about changing a broken system.
Please post pics of Lambos. 
People complain about fees, but as a business owner, I'm charged 3.8% for keyed card transactions, and I have to wait two business days for those to hit my checking account. The current merchant processing software is antiquated, but we rely very heavily on it. 
We have an annual inflation rate of 3.44% (or something close to that). 
The dollar is going to collapse. I feel like a crazy person saying that, but I'm concerned. 
We (the U.S.), print money like it's a monopoly game. 
"The Big Short"
It's gonna happen again. All we did was delay the inevitable crash. It's going to be much, much worse this time.

We're still early. Very, very early. Youre going to get a lot more FUD in the coming years. Hodl strong.

Not at all. I've been basking in your excellence and questioning my existence for weeks! Thank goodness you reached out. 
Just kidding. I'm super impressed by your market call. I'm still very happy. I got in at a good time regardless of my past mistakes.
What's next? Seriously. 
I try not to look at cryptocurrency as a way to make money. I think it's healthier to look at it as a way to change money.
