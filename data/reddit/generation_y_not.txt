Are you sure you are taking into account the actual *cost* of the banking system? Salaries, buildings, golden parachutes, security, pensions ...? Because you are comparing this to the cost of securing and running the bitcoin network so it seems odd to opt for a "per transaction" comparison. Energy and hashing is used to secure the network and keep a single ledger, not to actually make the transfer happen.

This. Was in Greece just ten days ago. It is the beginning of tourist season and tourists are bringing cash into the local economy. Most small merchants were already refusing credit card payments when I was there (saying the banking fees were too high but probably also anticipating that they might never see the money). 
If small shops in Greece started accepting bitcoin payments during this upcoming high season, they could get a serious foot in the bitcoin door. Especially since in many touristic countries/towns people make a big proportion of their income in a very short time and then need to store their earnings to spend them over several months when business is slow. In the absence of banks, bitcoin offers a clear advantage over cash here imo.

Not entirely true,while voting is not (yet) allowed at federal level, we have 3 levels of government (national,cantonal and municipal) and many municipalities allow voting for foreigners on municipal ballots and each Canton can implement it as well, I am sure it is a matter of a few years. However, I know of no country for now that authorises non-citizens to vote at federal level so what standard are you holding us to exactly?

Interesting boradcast for those who do not know about BTC - good analysis of recent events that were portrayed in the media. The analogy for "colored coins" being used to trace how money is spent in both "aid to third world countries" and by "parents who give their child an allowance" (!) is a bit unfortunate but oh well...

In saying this, she is not addressing this community. She is addressing the mainstream and she is doing it shrewdly because she knows full well that many major CEO's and opinion leaders out there still have the arrogance to believe that the internet and technology are nothing to reckon with and that they are the stronghold of marginalized subcultures like geeks, weirdos, socially awkward people and emo teens. 
Her comment is stupid but it is symptomatic of a wider phenomenon. She'll get away with it, basically.

It's funny how everyone is so worried about manipulating the whole population of a country - arguably this is harder than manipulating 51% of politicians, right...? No one claims it is a perfect system but I fail to see how your point is solved by top-down representative democracies where all the people you need to manipulate are concentrated in the same building/capital and all acquainted with each other. 
EDIT: More decentralization is *always* better IMHO.

Two police officers from the Temple City, Calif., sheriff's department flank him, looking puzzled. "So, what is it you want to ask this man about?" one of them asks me. "He thinks if he talks to you he's going to get into trouble."
"I don't think he's in any trouble," I say. "I would like to ask him about Bitcoin. This man is Satoshi Nakamoto."
"What?" The police officer balks. "This is the guy who created Bitcoin? It looks like he's living a pretty humble life."
So we have reached a point where any policeman knows
a) what bitcoin is
b) that the guy who created it is called Satoshi Nakamoto
c) that Satoshi Nakamoto is thought to be very rich
Yeah right. That's credible.

PS: I am not saying that cops don't know the internet, that they don't have interests outside their work, that they are bad people or that Santa does not exist.

I think you miss a point here. Switzerland is a *direct* democracy. The people get a say on every law that is passed by parliament, there is no such thing as parliament and government agreeing to rip off the citizens and splitting the money.

Yeah those are strictly regulated here,only one party has been stepping out of line and become "american" in their campaigns. More importantly, you earn little as a politician and power is never concentrated in the hands of one person or 1 party. We have 4 radically different parties sharing the 7 seats in our government. You cannot bribe a majority of them because their positions are simply too different to be targeted by any one special interest group.

The translation above is correct, but here is a summary of the relevant parts of the article, sorry for shaky syntax, English is not my native language (German is):
While searching the house of a private detective who was working for the Swiss intelligence service (NDB) - and the NDB confirmed that this detective was indeed working for them - in the framework of a Geneva court case, a powerpoint presentation entitled "BitcoinFeb2014" was found. This presentation included a model of how the NDB could pay its informants in the future - through Bitcoin (advantages outlined in the translation of the paragraph).
Another person involved in the court case is a Hacker, however, the NDB and the Hacker both denied that there was any collaboration between them. The power point presentation, however, included the name of an NDB agent and upon questioning, this agent admitted that the hacker helped him elaborating the Bitcoin payment concept for foreign informants. The NDB has no written trace of that collaboration but the agent claims that his hierarchy was informed about the project to elaborate this bitcoin concept.
The hacker (an IT specialist trained in one of the best schools in Switzerland, ETH Lausanne), then admitted that he was himself working as an informant for the secret service.
As far as Bitcoin is concerned, this is it. The rest of the article is about the court case.
EDIT: Addition - the main topic of the article is the link between the suspects in a court case (private detective, hacker and some other guy) and the Swiss secret service (NDB). So the Bitcoin powerpoint is just an element in the case that proves that there is a link between the Hacker and the NDB agent. The article is not really about bitcoin.
EDIT: Wow, thanks for the tip now, where I will find coffee for $1.50 in Switzerland, I don't know, hehe :)

The more big players are accepting bitcoin and converting it immediately to fiat, the more bitcoins will be available on the market in the short run.

I think many people still don't understand Mpesa - it is not a currency but uses the Kenyan shilling. Yes, it is convenient to send money fast and to any corner of the country because any small kiosk allows you to withdraw or send (i.e. put cash on your mpesa account or withdraw cash from it). However, the costs for taking out cash are very high compared to traditional bank transfers, this is often ommitted. That is why some restaurants in Nairobi have started to accept payments directly to their Mpesa account. So, in a way, Mpesa is developing to become a closed circuit, where the amount if cash that leaves the system reduces - similar to using debit cards.

Absolutely true, in fact,one of the very conservative Cantons did not have voting for women on cantonal level until 1992 - at that point the federal goverment kind of went *eff this* and forced them to introduce it. I'm a woman so clearly that aspect was problematic but on the other hand, today we systematically have 50% or more women in goverment (4 out of 8 or even 5 out of 8, counting the chancellor). 
Oh and we joined the UN in ... 2002.

Without the referendum, there would be no emotionalized atmosphere and also no discussion. It's not a perfect system, but it is better than top down representative democracy. I do not like where this country is going right now - at all - but all of Europe has seen a huge rise in Xenophobia in recent years and here at least it is something that is open to public debate and scrutiny unlike what is happening in Greece with Golden Dawn, Hungary with Orban's government or even Belgium with Vlams Belang (or however that is spelled). We have a problem right now with xenophobia but the democratic process is the only solution in the long run. People are less dumb than is commonly assumed and this trend will be reversed at some point.
