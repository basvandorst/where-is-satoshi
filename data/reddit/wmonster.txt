You must read the book 'The Bitcoin Standard'. This book takes an economic standpoint. This is the proper way to understand where the real value is.
Some alts are legit, only a few now; Anyway they don't compete with Bitcoin at any level.
You have already below a debate on this idea:

[bitcoin.com]( is still not reported as a 'deceptive site' on my Firefox browser (Help / Report deceptive site). We know this site is just a phishing operation.
Google don't want to report this site as a scam ? A simple question...

Indeed if you don't need 'security' you will have dozens of alts likely with a better marketing than the one you talked about.

Indeed we are in a bear market - But the fundamentals of Bitcoin are the same, and strong. Now lightning is operational, and the 'sidechains' are there too.
The noise is a big part of the issue; I'm sure we will see some of the big 'sh\*tcoin' going to zero before the next bull run.

When you think about Blockchain without Bitcoin. Bitcoin is the only one among cryptocurencies which have all properties; Immutability, security, 'trustlessness', censorship resistance, scarcity, hard money characteristics...  
Without Bitcoin a blockchain is just a DLT (Distributed Ledger Technology) , and a DLT has the same properties as any centralized database.
