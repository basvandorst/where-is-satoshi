Forget the Bitcoin ATM.....They need a PUNDI X PoS device. Where you can use multiple crypto currencies and not waste your Bitcoin.

Another reason to use Bitcoin or other crypto currency assets as a store of value for Chinese citizens, is that you cannot remove physical gold from the country and ultimately the Chinese government, by law, owns all the gold within their borders....Isn’t that swell?

Actually, a USD is worth less than a dollar.

I prefer Dodgey, thank you.

You mean CBOE Futures? Those aren’t physically backed. This is much different.

Ya, but they will have to eliminate the months category.

Why argue the fact that more avenues of awareness is negative? Bitcoin ain’t gona sell itself, it needs tools, marketing, and hands on use    to further adoption. You got problems with Bitcoin ATM’s too?? Lighten up Francis.

You’re funny, in that case we’ll be dead and gone by the time it reaches the right price. By the way your theory doesn’t seem to hold water since BTC ATM’s have doubled year over year. Go ahead and sit on your hands...
@_date: 2018-11-01 14:10:33
Ain’t that the truth.

Baakt and their investors are licking their chops. Buy the bottom because it will certainly go up.

Well.......don’t eat your own meat. But, let’s get past $20k first.
@_date: 2019-05-12 07:55:02
Just to add....the media has recently stated that Bitcoin has outperformed every asset class since the beginning of 2019. I’m a believer it’s price is for real, with your theory included.

“Best performing asset since the start of 2019”. If that isn’t a reassuring statement I don’t know what is.

That’s too bad, you’re about 3 years too early. They didn’t even have any product out then and you already sold?
