After lightning network is mainstream what will be the difference between Bitcoin and bcash? 
@_date: 2018-01-25 23:07:12
Soooooo bcash will be useless once everything is up and running for bitcoin..
@_date: 2018-01-25 22:49:04
So what use will bcash have after that?

Serious question. Why do a lot of people on here refer to erc20 tokens as shit coins when there are a lot of coins / tokens with real world use? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:42:07
Thats really good to know. Thank you

When I google binance it doesn't pop up at all. That's a little odd 
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:34:13
What is BNB?
@_date: 2018-06-12 17:44:45
Wouldnt it work great though alongside debts? Sort of like having gold as a store of value

It should mention how Bitcoin is the first anti-inflationary currency. 
Its finite number means your bitcoin cant burn away from printing more and decreasing its value

Im not really interested in it but If I have it then why not sell it? Do you know how to claim BCH off blockchain.info dannydisco or no?
@_date: 2017-11-20 20:19:08
That worked! Thank you
@_date: 2017-11-20 18:39:44
How exactly do I claim my BCH off blockchain.info though? Id happily use that service if I have the bitcoin cash already

For the bitcoin private fork do I need to own both bitcoin and zclassic or just one or the other?
@_date: 2018-02-14 16:38:13
Ahhh okay so having just Bitcoin alone won't work. Thanks for the reply 
@_date: 2018-02-09 15:26:54
Check out civic. They already have a working product and have customers. They specialize specifically in identity protection

Thats what I was thinking! the seller is from Prague as well and says hes getting his trezors straight from the manufacture 
@_date: 2018-02-18 01:16:31
It still can. Why does everyone think it's always over when it's going up? Nobody can predict anything in this market
@_date: 2018-02-18 01:34:23
It's a risky investment. Be realistic 
@_date: 2017-10-24 01:12:18
I'm curious, is it the same with Blockchain or jazz? 
@_date: 2017-10-09 15:51:36
Get In a Nutshell to make a video about Crypto currencies and it's potential future
@_date: 2017-10-23 22:30:24
What if my trezer got stolen? I know they will never be able to access them but will I ever be able to access my bitcoin again?

Is vitalik a big supporter / developer for Bitcoin along with his work on ETH? 
@_date: 2013-12-04 19:04:54
You think bitcoin will still go up in value?
@_date: 2013-12-04 20:20:01
Thats a good read! Thank you very much for that.
Now I'm inspired to buy some bitcoin. Where is a trust able source to buy some!? :)
@_date: 2013-12-04 19:32:12
Its always a pleasure! :)
I am using blockchain. Is that just as good in your own opinion?
@_date: 2013-12-04 19:04:33
That's useful! Thank you very much
@_date: 2013-12-04 21:12:54
Awesome! Thanks for your honesty bud
@_date: 2013-12-04 20:18:09
