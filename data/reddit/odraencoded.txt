2 years of your full time attention and you only have 10K lines of code? I have a project with 7K lines of code I made in one year programming it from time to time. LOC isn't a good quantifier for programming projects. :/
What is the total line change count of darkcoin during those two years?

How is it that you have dedicated time that you don't have yet?

Since you are TanteStefana and not TanteStefanaBot I'm hoping you could help me understand some parts of the article.
For example, how is it decentralized? AFAIK decentralized means, well, not centralized, and centralized means depending on a central node. As far as I know Darkcoin is just Bitcoins with DarkSend, and DarkSend doesn't seem to "decentralize" anything, it just anonymizes the ends using a swarm strategy.
So what is this decentralizing it's doing?

Imagine the following scenario: there is only you, an apple farmer, your employer, and one money in the world.
You cultivate one apple. Your employer gives you the one money. He keeps the apple.
You buy the one apple. Your employer (now merchant) takes the one money from you. You have the apple.
Next day, you cultivate two apples. Normally you would get paid one money for one apple, but there is only one money. So now you are getting paid one money for two apples. The value of an apple, and therefore your work, has vastly dropped simply because the amount of currency is static while the economic assets (apples) can grow.
If there was another apple farmer somewhere, his one money, the second money, would suddenly double in worth because of nothing. There is just no way such system could be called stable.
The alternative scenario is that you get paid one money for one apple. You don't get paid for your second apple. The economy breaks because there is not enough money to pay for services.
