You can do [identity registration with Bitcoin]( and lots of financial instruments can be done with its current scripting system, which admittedly kind of sucks, though the Bitcoin devs have long talked about implementing a "script 2.0".  Doing this sounds a hell of a lot easier than bootstrapping a brand new currency all over again.

I agree that liquidity managers and their customers don't have an obligation to maintain some price level, because that's impossible.  They only have an (implicit) obligation to be "responsible".

It might be informative to ask yourself, "What is gold backed by?"  Most of the time the response to this is "jewelry and industrial use".  But these only account for a few percent of its total demand; the rest is purely monetary demand, just like Bitcoin.  So _both_ are based pretty much completely on nothing other than "collective belief".
Money is always just a shared delusion - an anomalously overvalued asset - and gold is no exception.  Backing a digital currency may help with bootstrapping, but it's not fundamentally necessary, and it introduces counterparties into the architecture (antithetical to Bitcoin's philosophy).

Bitcoin may be seen as an idealized, synthetic international gold standard that requires no international political coordination.  At this point it would be the natural choice for individuals to transition to post-post-Bretton Woods, absent international coordination/intervention.
What would governments have to gain by opposing this natural transition in order to institute a relatively inferior, historically failed system?  Would they command enough authority/credibility to do this, considering the system they already administer is imploding?  Would international agreement be as easily reached, knowing there is a better alternative requiring no coordination at all?  Would policy makers with personal investments in bitcoin who stand to gain immensely prefer to just let bitcoin flourish?

You seem to be missing the point.  Bitcoin would be happening in parallel with or without governments.  I'm not arguing about the likelihood of the central banks that remain in operation using BTC to back their own currencies (though depending on the relative popularity of BTC to gold at the time, they could very well include it in some basket).


This reasoning is weak; it's akin to saying the French language has zero advantages over every other language, so why would anyone use it?  There are significant costs to switching to an altcoin, namely lost liquidity and security.  Money is generally a network effect, and Bitcoin even more so due to its security model.
Also, if by "intrinsic value" you mean that derived from non-monetary demand (I don't know what else you might mean), then that accounts for &lt;5% of the total demand for gold.  Hardly much consolation in the event that the purely monetary demand were to suddenly dry up.

Spy agencies will gain their edge by deanonymizing the transaction graph using data collected from exchanges, merchants, and ISPs - and perhaps even by compromising hardware and software.  Only if something has gone seriously wrong will this kind of information be publicly available.  Also note that this information is valuable to the spy agency no matter how obfuscated the public transaction graph becomes (via e.g. CoinJoin), so they will always retain an edge over the public.

That was only happening with the recent fee estimates that didn't allow you to specify a desired wait time.  For transactions between trusted parties (friend to friend), you generally wouldn't care if it even takes hours to confirm.  With these kinds of transactions paying less fees, the medians used to estimate will drop.
Actual transaction costs can be significantly reduced by miners broadcasting MerkleBlocks instead of full blocks, and assuming there is a functioning market between users and miners created by the fee estimation code, fees should be driven down to approximately their cost of inclusion.  Though we'll always be battling against exchange rate increases, as the inclusion cost is proportional to it.

Mt. Gox's failure dropped the market from $800 on Feb. 5 to a low of $400 on Feb. 25 (50% total loss), though eventually recovering to $640 today (20% total loss).  Hardly a "small blip".

Here's how I might think about a "fundamental analysis" for BTC:
Gold is used institutionally as a hedge against the risk of systemic failure of the post-Bretton Woods system, and BTC is positioned as a potential contender with gold in this ~$8T market.  Because this market is so huge, assume this is the dominant contribution to BTC's value.  Then the "fundamental value" of BTC can be expressed as 
~$8T * Pr(not gold but BTC becomes the monetary standard after a failure of the post-Bretton Woods system)
The probability in the formula is for the analyst to estimate, and the market currently implies it is $6.5B / $8,000B = 0.08%.
Note that Pr(the post-Bretton Woods system will fail) is assumed to be already baked into the ~$8T gold valuation.

Denominating debts in a deflationary currency only becomes problematic if the rate of deflation is greater than the rate of growth of the economy.  The reason for this is as follows:  Anybody can earn a return equal to the economic growth rate by holding a representative market portfolio, and this compensation defines the notion of a "risk-free interest rate".  This is a nominal rate - the real rate is that with the inflation rate (negative for deflation) subtracted away.  The nominal interest rate for a particular loan is equal to the real risk-free rate plus the risk premium for the borrower plus the rate of inflation (negative for deflation).  Obviously there is a problem if this becomes negative (nobody would pay to lend someone money).  Thus, the rate of deflation must remain less than or equal to the real risk-free rate of interest (i.e. the economic growth rate) in order for loans to be able to occur for arbitrarily small risk profiles.  But otherwise there is no problem - deflation just gets factored into the nominal rate in the exact same way as inflation does.
In a pure bitcoin economy in a "steady state" (approximately constant money supply and steady economic growth), the deflation rate is exactly equal to the growth rate, so denominating debts in BTC is not problematic.  Note however that shocks to the supply or demand for money can disrupt this into the problematic regime where the deflation rate is higher than the real growth rate.
Many people believe that central + fractional reserve banking are the primary causes of such shocks, and so a pure bitcoin economy wouldn't have to worry much about them, provided fractional reserve banking is largely curtailed using Bitcoin's technical features.
If this doesn't turn out to be true, and money supply/demand shocks remain prevalent, then perhaps bonds could be denominated in terms of some representative market index (or simply a fiat/BTC exchange rate if available), where Bitcoin is used only for servicing and trading them.  Although then there's the problem of having to trust that the price discovery mechanisms aren't being gamed.  But inflation indexed bonds already do this today, so it's not exactly uncharted territory.
NB: I'm not an economist, and I may be a bit off in my use of the jargon, but I believe the logic is sound.

A merkle tree is a binary hash tree, and they're used in Bitcoin to make the proof that a given transaction was included in a block succinct and quickly verified.  These proofs are important for lightweight nodes that only download transactions that are personally relevant, instead of full blocks.
Each block includes a merkle tree whose leaves are the transaction hashes.  The root is what's included in the block header.  A proof of transaction inclusion is the branch of the tree leading from the root to the corresponding leaf.

People absolutely keep letting that kind of thing happen repeatedly.  Not necessarily the same crop of dummies each time, but there are always plenty of careless newcomers to create perverse network effects and collective negative externalities.  Mt. Gox is just one in a long list of high profile Bitcoin fleecings.
But there's still hope for industry self-regulation; the service providers are also capable of recognizing systemic risks and collectively addressing them.  They could for example set up standards for operation and audit, and an insurance pool that would incentivize collective enforcement of these standards.
They're definitely running out of time to reassure the guys with the clubs, though; I'm sure regulators everywhere have this industry in their crosshairs.

He just stated without any justification that "the odds are severely stacked against [Bitcoin]".

All these oppositions I hear to Warren’s Bitcoin critique seem weak to me. Here’s a much better one:
Warren hates gold. But while he feels he has no personal use for an asset that carries no counterparty risk, or one that acts as a hedge against the risk of systemic failure of the post-Bretton Woods system, there still exists an ~$8T gold market. Any high valuation bitcoin attains will be from contending with gold for these uses, and not, as Warren correctly points out, due to usage as a temporary transactional vehicle. The financial risks that gold protects its owners from are obviously not “mirages”, and so neither is the large current valuation of gold, nor any future large valuation of Bitcoin.

You would transfer into the beta chain by provably "destroying" bitcoins, but all the coins on the beta chain would be periodically refloated back on the main chain by "protocol decree", along with any sufficiently tested protocol improvements.  In this way digital scarcity is preserved, while containing the risk associated with new protocol changes.
There are no conflicting incentives in merged mining the beta chain - doing so will help protect the value of bitcoin, and thus miners' hardware investments, as well as offer a wider variety of transaction types, earning them more in fees.

It means there is no possible input anybody can provide the script of the transaction output that would make it evaluate to 'true', i.e. the output can't ever be spent.  An incoming _valid_ transaction can only contain _spendable_ unspent transaction outputs, so a fully verifying node doesn't actually need to store unspendable ones.  This means it is free to discard them the moment it's done verifying the block they arrive in - though then it won't be able to serve them to other nodes later on, who may need them in order to sync up with the network.
This was enabled because there's ultimately no way to stop people from abusing the blockchain for arbitrary data storage, and this is the least destructive way to allow it.

At a current total hashrate of 40,000 TH/s [1], and using 400 MH/J of energy consumption by the average miner (taken to be a KnC Jupiter [2]), the Bitcoin network currently consumes about 40,000 / 400 = 100 MW of power.

I'd much prefer the ecosystem actually address this systemic risk and thrive as a result, rather than merely survive.
Hopefully the exchanges themselves can collectively self-regulate, but this isn't guaranteed.

From merriam-webster:
"marked by lack of steadfastness, constancy, or stability :  given to erratic changeableness "


I'd say this is likely true at any given time.  How about across time?


For pretty understandable reasons IMHO: they've been viewed as an attack on the promise that cryptocurrency is effectively scarce, and can therefore function as a long term store of value.

Anybody notice the similarity: "a company for carrying out an undertaking of great advantage, but nobody to know what it is"

Seems like this would have a sort of buffer effect on Bitcoin; if a move in Bitcoin is followed by a stronger move in the altcoins (say because their markets are smaller and easier to move), then since most altcoin trading is done in bitcoins, the initial bitcoin move would be dampened.  So the altcoins may stabilize bitcoin by drawing away excessive speculative capital when it's not needed, and then releasing it back to bitcoin later when it is.  If history is any guide (e.g. this summer), even just stability of Bitcoin is enough to draw away capital from the altcoins.

I hope nobody here holds any illusions about the types of people the altcoins attract.  Penny stock pump and dumpers are some of the scuzziest people you'll ever meet, and they've descended in full force on these things.

I thought the "Greenspan doctrine" was essentially that nobody can detect a bubble until after it has popped?

Why stop there?  Of course this logic is intuitively absurd and Metcalf's law is the reason why: "The value of a network is proportional to the square of the number of connected participants."
An open field for competition among actually distinguishable currencies would be great, but ours consists only of clones, practically speaking.  All that's accomplished by this is needless dilution of liquidity, mining power, mindshare, and development efforts.
Pointing this out is not persecution.

I also wonder how important gold's current volatility is to its owners.  I've been operating under the assumption that gold's modern role in the economy has largely been a hedge against the tail risk of systemic failure of the financial system, and that this is because it's been safe to assume that in a post-fiat world, gold would be remonetized.  Ben Bernanke stated this in response to Ron Paul asking him whether he thought gold was money, and it seems kind of obviously correct to me.  But if gold were to become remonetized, then its volatility would presumably be significantly less than it is currently.
It seems to me that the existence of Bitcoin brings into serious question the assumption that gold would be king in a post-fiat world, and that bitcoin's current relative volatility is rather meaningless for this question.  This would mean that if you're holding gold as a hedge, then you also need to diversify into bitcoin to "hedge your hedge".  I have no idea what percentage, but can it really be assumed to be zero, as Woo implicitly assumed in his analysis?  Even a single percent would introduce massive error in Woo's analysis.

You won't convince many people to stop doing something they're currently making a bunch of money at.  But unlike with Bitcoin the story driving their speculation is relatively unconvincing, so I suspect that when prices begin to stagnate or consolidate, people will get bored and nervous, and we'll see a flight to (relative) safety in bitcoin.  Actually it seems like this is exactly what happened throughout the summer with litecoin.
And like evoorhees mentioned in his recent litecoin post, the alt-coins draw the bottom of the barrel speculator away from Bitcoin, creating a stabilizing effect.  Unfortunately this will lead to alt-coins getting pumped up during bitcoin hype phases, but likely this stored value will "gravitate back toward the centre" during periods of consolidation.  That or the cryptocurrency market will prove to be too fickle to stably contain its liquidity, and the store of value promise ("gold 2.0") dies.
Something funny I noticed on evoorhees' post.  Top voted comment:




Notice the resemblance? :)

Funny, I find myself continually pleased with how generous it appears to be.
Edit: As someone who has been very generous with my bitcoins, your comment irritated me.  Well, more the number of upvotes it got.  There's plenty of generosity, lots public, but probably lots done less visibly as well; that we apparently warrant a reputation for being greedy is disheartening.

Silver was only historically necessary because of gold's impractical divisibility for commerce, and precious metals are held nowadays to hedge against the tail risk of total systemic collapse of the banking system.  But now that we have Bitcoin, it seems pretty ridiculous to expect a return to trading silver coins (or backed notes) in the event of banking collapse.  I personally sold the silver I owned based on this logic, and I'm sure I'm not special here.

Some info about fees to help with peoples' understanding:
The bigger a block is, the greater the likelihood that it will be orphaned, i.e. another competing block is found in the time spent broadcasting which ends up winning the race to be included in the longest chain.  So it costs money for a miner to include a transaction, and the fee should compensate for this.  This cost is proportional to the block reward, and the value of the block reward is proportional to the exchange rate.  Orphan rates, and thus fees, also depend on network topology, latencies, and bandwidths, which vary with time, and are difficult to accurately estimate.
Up until very recently, the exchange rate was small enough that fees were negligible, and we were able to get away with clunky mostly fixed fees.  Now we need smarter fee estimation by clients, so that a market between miners and users can form.  Gavin has been working on this recently.
We've also gotten away with a very inefficient block broadcasting scheme until now, whereby all transactions are rebroadcast with blocks, even if peers already have them.  Making this more efficient will bring down orphan rates significantly, and thus transaction fees.
FInally, P2Pool's distributed nature means it's likely much better connected to the network than centralized pools, and thus its blocks should make it to other miners more quickly.  So more miners switching to it could also lower overall orphan rates, and thus fees.

My worry is that through adoption of random "copycats", the cryptocurrency market will prove itself to be too fickle to stably contain its liquidity, meaning cryptocurrencies are useless long term stores of value (not warranting very high valuations in general).


I like to think the game dynamics will prevent this from even being a problem in the long term.

The author assumed that Bitcoin can't compete with gold because it's too volatile and too new.  Leaving aside whether Bitcoin's volatility will lessen over time, is gold's volatility actually an issue for its owners?
Suppose it's correct to say that people own gold largely to hedge against the tail risk of financial collapse because gold can safely be assumed to be the fallback currency in a post-fiat world.  (Ben Bernanke believes this, for whatever that's worth.)  Then why would it matter what gold's _current_ volatility is?
Considered only as a competitor to gold in the above sense, then why should it matter what Bitcoin's _current_ volatility is?  Bitcoin's volatiltiy would be significantly tamed through widespread usage in a post-fiat world, just as gold's would.
But if Bitcoin is even a minor competitor to gold, on the order of a few percent of its market capitalization, then this contribution to bitcoin's "fair value" dwarfs all others considered by the author.

Important questions for us:
1) What currently drives gold's large swings in demand?
2) Would these large swings exist if gold were remonetized?
I'm not entirely sure, but here's what I suspect:
1) Confidence crises in the fiat system.  People hold gold nowadays largely to hedge against the tail risk of collapse of the financial system.
2) Depends.  If fractional reserve lending remained prevalent, then the tail risk of systemic financial collapse would remain, meaning confidence crises would still occur, and in turn large swings in the demand for gold.  Otherwise, I don't see where such swings could originiate from.
If these answers for gold are correct, and if Bitcoin tends to largely curtail fractional reserve lending (e.g. due to being easy to store yourself, and being so transparently auditable), then it would seem Bitcoin should be stable enough with its fixed supply, given sufficent liquidity, i.e. widespread usage.
What could be the source in this hypothetical world of any large scale swings in demand for bitcoins?
