Only on Market Orders. If you do Limit Orders it’s free. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 01:58:35
What? No set a limit order of $0.01 or £ more than current price on GDAX if the price is currently rising or set it lower if price is falling and save money. Same time as Coinbase. 
tl;dr GDAX &gt; Coinbase

That’s what I’ve been doing. On paper it’s a great idea but you never really know what the moves will be. I bought a dip at $7500 and now I’m stuck with that and missing out on the current sale price. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 15:17:47
I can assure you they won’t. Haha. Ugh. The bonus was taxed heavily so hopefully I’ll get a decent chunk back around tax time and I’ll put it into bitcoin then.

Trade bots trying to fake each other out. I feel like they catch the momentum of anyone buying or selling. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 04:27:29
I’m still trying to understand the patterns. Not sure if there really is any. The bots may be reacting to moments before we can even form a thought about them. I did notice a few days ago in the attack the bots would stack a huuuuge sell order just above the current price then all at once those sell orders vanish and the price would surge.  Tried to make a post about it but the subreddit admin bot thing filtered my post out thinking it was FUD I suppose.

Yeah I️ see it as you pay a premium to remain anonymous or don’t want to link a bank account to an online service. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 00:25:28
Don’t do this. You will sell at 8000 expecting a dip, panic buy when it hits 8600 to try to catch a little extra profit you’re missing out on, it’ll immediately plummet to 7700 then gradually fall to 7500 and you will panic sell to try to catch have some cash ready to buy back at the bottom what you lost in your panic buy, at which point the price immediately rises back up to 7900 and you buy back in and cry because you realize you should’ve HODL’d from the beginning.

I’m sure we would all love the 200 bitcoins and a loving family. But the reality is that money can make people act irrationally. $2 million is a nice chunk of money to live very comfortably for the rest of your life but often is the case that people think “I’m Rich!” and blow through all of that in no time. If OP isn’t financially responsible then by all means let wifey in on it and splurge together. If OP knows she’s a financially responsible person then let her in on it. I’ve seen this within my own family. Some people are better off not knowing how much money is there.

I was leaning more toward Louis Vuitton but same deal. My girlfriend is always telling me how many thousands of dollars we need to spend on her shoes which is why she doesn’t need to know about my BTC investment. This is coming from a guy that wears some beat up steel toe work boots every day so my opinion may be a little biased against shoes that are worn once then tossed into a closet.

On Coinbase I pressed "Buy" when it just broke beneath 3k but since I'm new to Bitcoin I wanted to check this sub before I pressed "Confirm". The bet was closer to the 2.6k range. Then I convinced myself I would go for it and as soon as I hopped back over to Coinbase it was at 3.2k 
Just a random spike, it'll drop back down.
That's gotta be it, it'll drop back down.
Looks like a plateau here.

Honestly I was expecting the drop to be much more. Now Americans are waking up and buying back what was sold. 
@_date: 2017-09-13 15:05:39
Last big drop a few months ago was about 30% and 3200-3300 would be about 30% from the recent high.

 Said the same thing when I first invested last month. I bought in at $3940, then it plunged to around $3000. After a week or two when it got back up to $3900 I sold just because I was worried. Lost a little bit overall, but not too bad. 
But then it started climbing again...
So yes, buy in. Buy now. It’ll be back to reaching new ATH in two weeks

I was literally just thinking the same thing! Everyone is worried about China banning bitcoin. Trading will still happen there anonymously/illegally. If they ban it, give it a few months for people to see trading happening almost back to normal. 
Ransomware will still be out there forcing itself onto users unaware of crypto. Dark net markets will still need this currency. 
It's just fluctuating over media hype right now. 
It's fine. 
Everything is fine.

I anticipated the wait and sold last week at $4000 with my cost around $3960 so I could buy back in after this potential dip coming up. Cash hit my bank the next day when I was expecting a week. Could've held out longer to make a much larger profit.
Oh well.

I just switched to GDAX and I’m doing this. Plan ahead what the fees will be and if you make any money on it at all it’s worth it. Set Buy and Sell limits. If it dips below your sell price for a while, no worries, it’ll come back. It always has.

@_date: 2017-10-24 02:26:58

I’ve been trying to day trade, read trends, buy and sell at the best times and honestly the best thing to do is to just buy it at any time and dont touch it no matter what the itch tells you. I’ve made a small profit from what I’ve been doing but I would have made more had I left everything where it was when I first bought in.

Try it and let me know. I tried on Coinbase but I didn’t factor in how much they change the buy/sell price. Just went to buy while the price was at $5575 but it was trying to buy at $5605. 
Heard Gemini was good so I’d like to know if it’s easier to calculate there. 
@_date: 2017-10-10 20:01:42
I need to do this. Tried to play the market a few weeks ago and made $50 profit. Had I HODL'd I'd be looking at $600 profit now with even higher on the horizon. 
@_date: 2017-10-12 13:23:34
I had just changed jobs and heard about Bitcoin and wanted to buy in but I was flat broke waiting on my first paycheck to come through and when it did I had plenty of bills to catch up on.

Click on "Fee" next time you go to place an order. Also depends on where you are at. 
In the US it breaks down like this:
&lt;$50 = $1.99 Fee
51 - 99 = $2.99 Fee
