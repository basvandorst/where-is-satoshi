It's for everyone, but people are hypocritical because they mostly want to get rich off of it and their ideals take second place when they see hype

Yep, beware. I have the same problem :S 
I just heard about new service for getting back crypto from scams/hacks made by AML company Coinfirm, called - ReclaimCrypto. Maybe useful information.

McAfee talking sh... Take a look at Coinfirm report, they have almost all exchanges. Exchanges with full kyc/aml more care about users. Just say. [

Welp, just look at the job AMLT is trying to do with this stuff. Raising awareness should be the minimum of what people would do. Not accounting for the report they're making.

What? How so?

That said, i doubt Bitcoin can be any more controlled. Monitored, maybe.

The growth is insane, now we need to just solve the routing and make it more user friendly. Global financial system is within the reach already.

Of course they cover each other's backs, duh
