Ethereum has a lot of innovation with all their tokens. I wouldn't discredit that. Bitcoin is still awesome though, great community!!

The only reason I hodl is because I have nothing worthwhile to spend it on. I use it every chance I get, but no local stores take it around me.

I always jokes about retiring when I'm 35.... Might actually happen... MOON!

I buy every week. Whatever the price is.

I got my coin deposited into my bank account and then it got taken back out a week later... wtf. Kind of pissing me off

I like your idea a lot, but I really hope they put that money towards a customer service department. Its been 10 days and I still haven't had a reply back yet... they need to step that up before anything else imo
