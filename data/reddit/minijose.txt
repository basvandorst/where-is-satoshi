Another note: When I got into bitcoin I was really enthusiastic about the tech.  I was in bitcoin for 3 years before taking my money out at 17k (might go back in later but I see most of its value coming from hype right now), and I don’t know shit on what the price is gonna do.  But I still have friends hitting me up asking me what my target prices were and to give them financial advice.

History doesn’t repeat itself but it does rhyme.  There have been bigger crashes with just as large amounts of optimism for the market before.  That’s how people get screwed.

I’m for listening to everyone, but just realizing that even if a person seems really confident, don’t let that fool you into thinking they’re an expert.

Really bad analogy there.. people will upvote anything that gives them false hope when it comes to bitcoin..

“Surviving” = HODLing and hoping things work out

Taken as to say - listen to their financial advice.  Prick.

“I’m a coder and I approve of bitcoin!”  - some false hope for all the pole dancers and unemployed that are in this shit to get rich..

I believe in crypto as well.  Ideally I’d put my money in when the majority of the public who didn’t really do their research and view crypto just as a get rich scheme start thinking that it’s a scam.

This is exactly my point.  Truly no one knows if bitcoin is going up or down or left or right.  If they were 100% sure then they would just not seek confirmation and put their life savings into it.

You're not thinking like the 1%, you're just hoping to get lucky without hard work through a volatile investment.
