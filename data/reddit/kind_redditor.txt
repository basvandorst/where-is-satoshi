You really think the guy/people who invented Blockchain/Bitcoin is/are that stupid as to keep all his/their coins in one address? LOL

9 BTC and no hardware wallet? Seriously? You have been in crypto since 2015 and you do transaction with that amount ONLINE on a Windows? COME ON!
Posting shit accusing people of stealing without any proof? No tx id, no nothing?
Come on, you've gotta try harder than that...

Yeah, I should have made it clearer. Alternatively, you can boot Tails  from an USB stick and create a wallet there (without an Internet connection). No need for an additional computer.

Chill, they switched to BCH two days ago, but looking at the BCH crash now, tomorrow all miners are gonna be back. Prepare for the moon!

Stop posting this shit.

Lol I'm gonna be rich when it gets to that.

Something like this: 
You might need to google for additional info. The first comment there is also useful.

I'll get banned for this, but that's not how it fucking works. The price must be high enough so that it's profitable to mine bitcoin. If people stop mining, there will be no fucking chain, no fucking transaction and your money will be lost forever, because no one is gonna take those bitcoins from you.
I can't believe people are upvoting this dumb shit.
@_date: 2017-11-12 21:25:12
Yes, no, who the fuck knows?
@_date: 2017-11-04 15:36:40
I fucking hate this kind of posts. Y'all are smartasses now just cause the price went up. It's called hindsight bias!

DO NOT TRUST ANYONE. Always create wallet offline (e.g. with Electrum) and NEVER EXPOSE your private key online. Especially when you have almost 400 BTC LOL
It's hard to believe someone with 387 has no hardware wallet.

Yet you have time to open paint, draw a stupid curve for this shitpost? Wonderful.

They'll probably lose everything. They made sure everything is as secure as possible, but fire? It's all lost.

@_date: 2017-10-20 10:31:38


No, you wouldn't. You only say that now, because the price went up. It's called hindsight bias.
@_date: 2017-10-19 11:12:21


Bullshit technical "analysis". Zoom in and check another "double top" in June 2017. Oh uh, look where we are at now.
@_date: 2017-10-18 14:36:45
The thing is though, how do you know when it'll bounce back? No one knows that. Most people will lose, so they are still idiots as OP said.
@_date: 2017-10-19 10:56:08


Well, it's the best time to do some research then?
And Bitcoin Gold is most likely a scam
