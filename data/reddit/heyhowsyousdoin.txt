That's how you can get your initial data load, but it sounds like you want to use some of that to make subsequent api calls, no? The tools I mentioned can help you do so. If you give me more detail on what you are trying to do I can give you a more specific answer

You'll need to use another tool (awk/grep/jq/script in language of your choice) to dig into the payload.

I had a chance to look at their docs. A withdraw looks like it is just one request, so if you are getting a 200 back you should be good to go.
So the string you will paste into your browser before subbing in your own variable values is:
Maybe add &amp;priority=medium to the end of that if it's taking too long, idk what dogecoin confirmation times are like.
They don't have any example responses, but if you look into the response body from your withdrawal it will probably have the transaction id which you can pull out and use to monitor confirmations.
If this is something that you want to be repeatable, I would definitely look into scripting it out
