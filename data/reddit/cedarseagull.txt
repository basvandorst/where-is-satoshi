You do know the bubble was based on exchange manipulation, right?  Let's not call outright fraud a "bubble", please.   Google "the willy report"

Let me guess that you hold bitcoin and don't spend lots of bitcoin because you hope to make a huge amount of money off of it.

Why is this not a good solution?  Why can't a company make a new blockchain?

How do you get into lending bitcoin at these high rates?

How does giving him BTC via changetip prove you're the guy?  
@_date: 2015-05-17 14:02:13
That doesn't sound like a win-win if there's no win for the merchant.

When you say "networks" do you mean other boards filled with sane people?  If so, what are they?  If not, how do you find yourself meeting bitcoin people in real life?

This is one of the reasons I got out of bitcoin.  Too many people just sitting on the sidelines waiting to become overnight millionaires.  They think that because the price 5x'd in Nov of 2013 that it's likely to happen again soon.  Unfortunately for them "mooning" probably won't happen again, because when it last happened it was due to systematic fraud on the part of Mt Gox.  
I really hope BTC takes off; however, at the moment it would be in spite of and not because of the majority of its user base.

While I think you're technically correct with your definition of "speculation", the word has taken on a colloquial definition of an excessively risky investment.  For example, no one calls buying shares of a company that doesn't offer dividends "speculation" even though you're holding an asset you intend to sell in the future for dollars (the other asset in your definition).  
Semantics aside though, I think that for bitcoin to succeed it needs to be more than "speculation" (your definition or mine), and I feel that's what dominates today's market.  In order to have a true value-add proposition, bitcoin needs to be a transaction medium, which I think it really can be, we just need more people to actually participate and demonstrate value rather than buy and hold.  Don't get me wrong, speculating may pay off with an inflated value, but that's a greater fools scenario and I don't really want to bank on convincing more people to buy bitcoin based on the hopes they'll become overnight millionaires.  For the record I have about $50 of BTC in a coinbase wallet that's hooked into my phone, so I'm always looking to spend, I just can't really bring myself to invest (or speculate) :-)

Most of the parties on that list would identify as anti-bitcoin because they are all pro establishment organizations.  People who are already wealthy who want less regulation so they can become wealthier.

This transaction needed more friction in the form of transaction fees to get it rolling through the network.

That's it!  Except the chart doesn't make sense because people accept the stuff on the left for good and services.  It would make more sense if the left were wildly varying amounts of btc.  Then the graphic would make sense.

This explanation is, IMO, the most likely to be true.

Yea it is.  No one important cares about that though.

I had a friend who was a total asshole, always "right" about everything but upon further inspection always wrong.  Me and another friend who I highly respect would take smoke breaks with him on occasion.  Just after Bitcoin came out he told us about it.   Before you could even get it exchanges and the right at about the time people were using gpu clusters to mine.  1k would've made me 37mm.  Only thing that keeps me sane is the fact that I would've sold at 100 and the fact that our shithead friend never bought in either.  
@_date: 2017-09-27 16:07:47
I guess I don't understand the difference between money transfer system and a "coin".  Could you elaborate?  Thanks.

Millions of dollars in drug transactions happening every day regardless of the volatility.  You may not like the goods and services it's being used as a currency for, but it IS being used as a currency by many people around the world.

"Bitcoin = Internet" should be added to that card.

Weird, I thought BTC was supposed to be easier than cash.  It's weird that these employees wouldn't want to make their lives easier.

Damn, US01337!!!!  Seriously though, how about the address your drugs would've been sent to?  Probably a few of those in the 50k private messages.

What if I told you those 30+ people were financially incentivized to believe anything they thought would increase the price of bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-03-11 17:37:59
Oh please.  shut. up.  You're into bitcoins which means women aren't into YOU.  
@_date: 2015-02-22 00:51:41
Bold guess: you own bitcoins and don't spend much at all in bitcoin.  I'll also assume your dollar cost average is far above the current price.  Sorry for your loss.
@_date: 2015-02-16 16:02:25
Here's the thing though, they've got some good points.  I bought from 400 -&gt; 1000, sold then bought at 450, and sold at 300.  I lost about a grand in total, not a big deal for me.  I saw bitcoin as a quick way to make money, but really, i was gambling.  I sold to minimize losses because I thought the price wasn't going above 500 for at least a year or two.  I had read and saw the trolling, and it annoyed the hell out of me because I had a personal stake in it's success.  
Then a weird thing happened: once I had no financial incentive to see the price rise I stopped caring and realized that most (not all) of what fueled the discussion around bitcoin was either greed or delusion.  When you step back and consider that something like 8 people own 30% of coins you really have to question what's going on.  Average people are basically being asked to coronet new royalty because they ran a program on an old machine they had in a closet or got rich and bought a bunch early on.  Don't get me wrong, I know there's disparity in the way capitalists make money in the world, but these guys want huge control of the market and a massive upside in 1000's of times their investment for really not much work.  I'm not okay with that and I won't support it with my money.  
Then consider the amount of get rich quick "whens the next bubble?!?!?" posts and all of the TA threads (check for those).  Not to say there's anything bad about studying a market and trying to figure it out, but lots of the discussion is really about making as much money off of the swings as possible, which really adds no value to bit coin as a tool for spending money easily digitally.  Isn't THAT what this whole thing is supposed to be about?  It seems like the trading aspect has really outweighed the practicality in many people's minds.
The delusion criticism comes from people suggesting that "we're revolutionizing the world" when in reality their "libertarian utopia" is quite unpleasant.  An exchange gets hacked and they say cold storage or multisig.  Then people start to question why they're suggesting a system where you've got your lift savings in private keys sitting in your house.  Then others suggest coinbase or putting your keys in safety deposit, the exact system of centralization they're claiming to overthrow.  
And then there are some genuine users who are interested in using Blockchain technology to make  the world better.  To them I say thank you.  Personally I think the Blockchain is the coolest assembly of technologies I've ever been exposed to.  If there are any subs/forums consisting of mostly these people someone please let me know, I'm interested.
All in all, I hope bit coin succeeds as digital cash.  I just don't see it happening given the current climate of this sub.  Until then, though, [to the moon!!!!!](
