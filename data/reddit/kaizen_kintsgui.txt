When the corporations built the interstate system? Oh... wait. Or when the corporations invented the internet? Oh wait...
You are using technology that the American government funded. Guess who dominates the internet? American companies.
You live in a world of fantasy if you think libertarianism is the ultimate solution. Care to point out a country with a high quality of life that run's on libertarianism? That's right. You can't. Rugged individualism simply isn't an effective means for running a country. Quit lying to yourself. Your just carrying the Koch brothers et al water.
What do you get from democratic socialism? Norway — For the 13th consecutive year, Norway ranked highest in standard of living, life expectancy, and education. Thanks to the country's robust, publicly funded healthcare system, the average life expectancy is 82 years.

Arguably the best deal for us. It's the deal that we all owe our thanks to. It's the best deal in the history of trade deals,that ever happened to us, maybe ever.
So your meme is off, but I'm not surprised.

I hope crypto reduces identity to a public key. Then we can have as many as we want.

For me, I do BTC because it has a lot of high quality volunteer talent.

Oddly, this was my approach. 
Institutions can really help non tech savvy people diversify into BTC and get on these avg 350% per year gains.
Let there be moon.

What do you mean by model?
How we provide social services?
Whatever the model will be, any centralized institution will be flattening out into networks of services. We are already seeing it with UBER, Google, amazon, facebook and air bnb. Those companies are a blend between centralization and networks.
The model of the future is going to be decentralized networks. Why do we need UBER to handle the transactions between user and car in a bitcoin world?
In the new model, any network is going to have to compete with each other for users. This include governments. Estonia is already heading in this direction with their digital residency program. Keep an eye on them for cool new developments. Some really good ideas coming out of that country.

A common shared vision. 
Check this out, it's called realistic conflict theory. If you abstract people into nationalities, conflict is inevitable. Check out the Robbers cave study.
Simon Synek also address the issue in "Leaders Eat Last."
Also, human's aren't extrinsically motivated. Extrinsic motivators have shown to demotivate people. Inferring universal basic income can work. People are intrinsically motivated to build things. At least 85% of the population anyway.
You can read more on this in Daniel Pink's Drive.
Give people their basic human rights as well as additional economic freedoms, conflict will reduce if not all together dissapear.
Furthermore, Income inequality needs to be addressed. It is a common factor in the collapse of past civilizations. Egyptians, Macedonians, mayans, romans ect.
I wish I could remember the source for this. It was an ancient civilization book I read in university.

Get used to it, globalization hasn't even started. You think boarders are going to remain when Bitcoin collapses national currencies? 
Nations, global decentralized currency. Pick one.
