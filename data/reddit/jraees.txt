Hey, I work for BitPay and we have a BitPay POS application that you can set up on your mobile phone or tablet and accept BTC or BCH directly and see cash the next business day, for 1%. Signing up for an account is free and takes 15 minutes. You can feel free to email me directly at jraees with questions!

I work for BitPay - we are the worlds largest Bitcoin payment processor and we've processed several real estate transactions (almost $200m last year in real estate alone). We usually work with escrow companies to help accept payment in the form of Bitcoin, but still receive cash. Bottom line, you can accept bitcoin and bitcoin cash for a down payment or even full payment, but still recieve the exact amount of cash (no risk of price volatility). Feel free to email me at [jraees for more info.

You can buy amazon gift cards directly from the BitPay wallet.

Hi there! You don't have to accept BTC directly, if you'd like, you can use the BitPay (I work there) platform to accept BTC and BCH payments, but still get cash to your bank account the next business day. Feel free to email me directly at jraees and I can explain more.

Disclaimer: I work at BitPay.
I know downloading a new wallet is annoying, but I promise there are reasons why we've implemented payment protocol. And it's not to make money or push our own agenda, but to solve real problems for our customers. 
Check out these articles that explain more. And pay attention to the stats!
