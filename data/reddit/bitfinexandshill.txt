This is pretty disturbing. What can be done about this? What are the damages this can lead to?

Thanks. I underestimated what they can sell for. I find antminer s7 that still sell for decent price.

It has the same chain as the original BTC. That's pretty much it.

Buy coins instead. ant miner will never generate as much coins as it costs.

Thanks made me feel better. Still would like to go back in time and slap myself and buy coins and hold instead. Did the math and there is no way they will generate the amount of coins the cost. sigh...

those are rookie number. jk congrats. maybe in 2019 you will have 5000 dollars.

How much is it? I helped someone for like an hour and then I found out he had 58$ in it. It's probably 200$ now but still not worth the effort. Good luck

He gave out the private key? anyone can move funds lol

I was worried about the mempool getting clogged/backed up combined with the hash power leaving and bch spiking up to 2500. It would have been a disaster. Some part of me still thinks that bithump crashing saved bitcoin.

Thanks, when I thought of it I made a new account just to use it XD

send it to roger ver's address. It will eventually end up in his pocket anyway.

private key is written on the paper. he just needs to create a bch wallet with the same private key. right?

Thing is I didn't need a crystal ball to see it. It was obvious that buying coins was the best way to go.

He is an arrogant cunt. Just watch 
@_date: 2017-11-17 15:57:15
It doesn't work like that.

flip a coin 256 times for 1/0

He has enough money to buy an island and only allow people who like him to live on it. Oh wait, he is actually going to do that.
@_date: 2017-11-17 14:51:29
I remember both your post and his post. That was a nice deal.
@_date: 2017-11-17 12:03:13
No one will know, just shut your mouth and do whatever you want.
