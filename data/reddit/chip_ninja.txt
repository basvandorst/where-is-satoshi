Eh, and that's why there's a problem.  
Apple devices aren't in any way more secure, and in some cases detection of serious issues hasn't happened in a reasonable timeframe.  Even if they push out a patch quickly, it doesn't matter if it takes them 6 months or a year to realize there's a problem.  
Bottom line, if you use technology you're at risk.  More so if you're ignorant as well.  Realizing how insecure things are is the first step to developing a proper security mindset.
@_date: 2016-08-29 12:43:31




I'm not saying that at all.  Android is horribly insecure.  You're absolutely right that having the OS tampered with by carriers, and manufacturers, who then often neglect to push critical updates (while installing poorly written &amp; updated bloatware) is a huge issue.  
What I'm saying is mobile devices in general have massive failures, and people have a tendency to buy in to marketing touting the latest and greatest security feature, and automatically trust the system without objectivity.
The *idea* of only verified and legitimate apps being distributed on the app store is a good one, as is encrypted storage by default, and even the idea of biometric security.  The problem is there is no feasible way for Apple, or any other company for that matter, to prevent malware from reaching a store.  **Any** algorithm used would be able to be figured out and bypassed, and like anti-malware systems, any brand new code that doesn't trigger heuristics will get around it.  It's not feasible for people to read through all the source for every released app either.  That results in some (now detected) malware having been on the app store for [10 months]( before removal.
Now don't get me wrong, there's malware all over the play store.  They have horrible detection rates, and some stays under the radar for quite a while.  The **only** thing I was trying to dispel is the notion that Apple's security features are enough that people shouldn't have to think about the security of their device.  They aren't, and neither are those of Android, Windows, or Linux devices.  The security landscape constantly shifts, because it's quite honestly an arms race.  For every new security feature, there are countless people working on ways to bypass or hijack said feature.  That is regardless of OS.  Sometimes you'll hear about it, but more often than not by the time you do it's already too late.
The *biggest* reason attacks aren't as common on Apple devices is due to marketshare.  People looking to extract the most amount of money through exploits and malware will always target the most used OS.  That means Windows (for PC) and Android (for phone).  The iOS marketshare has been growing, and unsurprisingly, so too have reports of malware over the last year or two - while in the early days of iOS you really didn't hear a lot about it.
Bottom line, I'm not trying to attack you or your device - I'm responding to the claim that a feature which has regularly failed in the past (and continues to) makes the phone more secure.  If it worked as intended, I'd agree with you.  *Even with it's failures*, **yes**, *it's a step up from not having it (Android)*, particularly for users with little to know security awareness (i.e. most people).  
The problem as I see it is there are people who are lulled into a false sense of security because of the intent of those features, without realizing that it isn't as foolproof as Apple likes to claim.  It's especially problematic because the majority of people think that they can run an update or two on their device of choice and are magically protected and stop thinking about security for the next year or two.

It really depends - you can find numbers based off OS detection when visiting sites on the web, go off shipped devices, etc.  I wouldn't call any of it accurate, but it does give you a pretty decent picture IMO.
I do agree that Apple isn't a small player though.  All I was driving at is from nearly everybody that collects marketshare (independently anyway) *do* put them behind in numbers - but globally there are also a lot more extremely low end android devices being used in poorer countries.  To be fair, I don't doubt numbers are faked, and pretty sure Apple's market share has been growing.  Still, globally?  Those are some expensive devices.


That's part of the point I was trying to make here.  The "Genius" at the "Genius" bar will tell you differently though.  Have a major hack take place and contact Apple and they'll keep it pretty hush hush and refuse to communicate with affected customers (to the point of telling people their device is good to go, when it's still owned).  Thanks to that behavior, a *lot* of people buy into it.
@_date: 2016-08-28 19:43:51

You know, I heard the same thing from Apple reps when they tried to explain how a macbook was completely owned, and a charity was drained of all it's funds.
Look, not trying to bash on your favorite device of choice here, just trying to point out that isn't objectively true - particularly when it comes to malware.  On more than one occasion there have been pretty major incidents including malicious apps appearing on the store, legitimate apps on the app store being infected, tools used in their development being infected, etc.
I mean, there was even a ton of stuff being written recently about AceDeceiver which doesn't require a jailbroken device to screw over the end user.


Security is a process, it's not a state.  In order to be as secure as possible you actually have to continually put forth effort - which means you need to be mindful of the failures in the devices you use.

First thing, that's pretty redundant.  Ops is short for operations.
Second, you don't need a black ops team.  You just need a group of people who know what they're doing.  I'd say you have private groups of all political leanings taking part, individuals, *and* government sponsored groups.

I know we're in the btc subreddit, but how do you figure?
While people struggle over upcoming advancements to BTC, attempt to push detrimental changes, etc, alts continue to drive forward to specific goals.
Not all of the alts are intending to function like a speculative asset or currency - which imho is one of the biggest problems with BTC (aside from ridiculous transaction fees, times, split mining resources, etc).  Trying to lump all the innovations into "3 or 4 coins" honestly just shows a lack of understanding in the implications.
It's no longer about "hodl" but about managing logistics, contracts, decentralized hosting and apps, and a ton of other things which has a ton of potential for both big businesses and individuals alike.  If you really want to talk about what happened with operating systems and the like we can go that route but I don't think the analogy works quite the way you're trying to make it sound.

I'm guessing the discussions and arguments about disclosure of vulnerabilities are just for fun then?  If companies responded to them like they *should* I don't think we'd have people advocating for public disclosure or non-disclosure quite as often as they are.

You're right, we didn't get a specific timeline - but my *impression* is the entire thing took place during a pretty short timeframe.  IDK if that's the case, which is why I phrased it like I did.  Their response is what really gave me that impression - if that's not the case Coinbase should realize there are people getting that impression so they can address it.


I'm not saying OP did or didn't.  For all we know OP might have... point is it's awfully coincidental the ban for it kicks in at the same time.  It makes it seems like someone was *looking* for an excuse to ban the account.


The same reason those people have been despised by other corporations and governments worldwide.  Their actions have the potential to make them look bad.  The problem here is you're looking at it with logic and reasoning where as many companies don't.  In the real world banning accounts and pushing legal charges are common responses for security testing.

There are a lot of reasons people pirate things - which by the way isn't quite the same as stealing.  Stealing requires that the owner unable to use what has been stolen - which does not happen with piracy.  It might seem like nitpicking, but while Hollywood tries to treat it identically - it is not and should not be treated the same as theft.
People pirate is because they are unable to pay for the content.  People also pirate as a method of previewing the content; many movie companies in Hollywood have made horrible movies recently - and people quite simply don't want to pay exorbitant rates when they don't seem worth it.  Bad content will get deleted, and content deemed worth it will be paid for - assuming there is a way to pay for it of course.
My point is you're making a broad statement claiming it applies across the board - but quite honestly it doesn't.  Piracy is a complex topic, there's a lot more involved than just "oh people expect to get everything for free."  
Back on topic though, I have no problems paying for content personally... but what I would hate is to pay for click-bait articles (which would increase in frequency IMO), or other poorly created content designed just to milk money out of people, and to be honest I think that's the larger issue here.
@_date: 2015-01-15 16:50:50
First, the whole argument you seem to be getting at is the whole "if you've got nothing to hide" bit.  It's tiresome and woefully inadequate.  Whether or not such a system is currently being misused or not is irrelevant because like all other technology it's only a matter of time.  Now before you go back to saying


I'd like to point out that's a pretty common statement throughout history.  Of course we're civilized now right?  I mean, humanity has gone without killing it's own citizens (let's limit it to 1st world even) for how long now?  Oh, less than 100 years?  Ok, pretty sure we've got nothing to worry about.  Let's just consider the fact that we've seen pretty regular cycles of oppression, and such a system just makes it that much easier to do.  When you know anyone and everyone who's ever made a statement you disagree with and can look all of them up going back decades, you've got a powerful tool that's begging to be misused.  Who's going to do anything about it?   As soon as anyone says anything...
You don't have to agree with the premise, and you're free to think whatever you like, but you've got a pretty fundamental misunderstanding about why people are up in arms and why it's a big deal.  It has a chilling effect on free speech.  There's a difference between privacy and secrecy, something which many people with that argument don't seem to get.
@_date: 2015-01-31 22:49:51


Not like they caused a mass panic to trigger certain responses... or continue to screw people over by investing in things they shouldn't... or were fixing prices of commodities... or laundering drug money with the money of their customers... or committing fraud on a regular basis...  Sure, we moved to a system suggested by the people who organized the crash to "prevent" further problems, but there sure seem to be a hell of a lot of others to take it's place.
Not so sure I'd trust the banks.  They don't care about keeping *your* money.  They care about **their** money, and don't care what they have to do to make it multiply.  Seems to me that there are plenty of problems with USD and banks as well that need to be worked out.
@_date: 2016-03-14 16:37:01
Yeah, just figured I'd throw that out there to add on to your post.  There seem to be a lot of people that miss the implications of what they're asking for (like some of the politicians), I'm assuming because of a lack of technical expertise.
As a tangent, the related Juniper fiasco is a great example of non-related damage done by these decisions.  A ton of companies, government agencies, and government contractors have already been compromised as a result of the backdoor, and even more are at risk (see this [Shodan result]( ).  So even though we know this means there's a high risk to all of our telecommunications providers, government, etc, politicians and government agencies keep pushing for it.
More specifically both Trump and Hillary have been pretty vocal in their support of forcing Apple to do this one way or another.  Bernie Sanders, while not quite as vocal on it as the others, has also made comments about a middle ground being reached (i.e. the same magical solution garbage everyone else is preaching).
If this isn't addressed by a ruling in the very near future (which I don't think is likely), I think there's a pretty good chance that whomever we elect will either implement an executive order, or as seems to be most common when there's backlash, we'll see it tucked into some other unrelated legislation.  Whether they use the All Writs Act as the justification at that point really becomes moot - but either way the end result is the same.
Pretty sure I'm preaching to the choir though considering which subreddit we're in.  Really wished John Oliver would have touched on some of these related issues rather than just the privacy angle - but still it's great that it's getting attention.  We really need the same kind of thing for older generations though.

Nice, I do love me a variety of chips, of course poker chips and computer chips are best chips.
That's a great entertaining example of how Tor helps now, although I do think it's worth keeping in mind such vast collection systems (like those being used by the NSA) historically turn out pretty bad despite how anyone might spin it.  It's early, and a lot can happen over decades.  It's extremely foolish for people to take the all too common it can't happen to me mindset.  It can't happen here is naive - the only way to prevent massive abuse is for people to take a stand - which they're generally too lazy to do these days.

Honestly that nuance is mostly irrelevant.  Brute forcing a 4 digit pin takes barely any time at all.  Allowing for repeated attempts without consequence will essentially allow anyone who wants to break into someone else's phone the ability to with little to no effort.


That's one of the issues - or at least part of a larger issue.  *If* a precedent is set compelling Apple to do this, we're also going to see them compelling other companies to undermine their security in the name of terrorism.  
What people forget is these events aren't isolated.  The government attempted to compel encrypted email providers to provide access to email accounts of their customers.  The NSA sent people into Juniper to backdoor their equipment.  They continually seek to demask Tor users regardless of whether or not they are *actually* criminals.  All while nearly every politician we have props encryption up as a tool of boogeymen.
When you consider the context, it paints a completely different picture of the qustion "can the All Writs Act be used to compel companies to create new things against their will?"  Of course we'd likely see the use of the act expanded in unforeseen ways later on, but *right now* it's also very clear what they want to use it for.

Not to be that guy, but linux's current popularity is more due to it being free and not marketed... and  Microsoft pays manufacturers to install Windows by default.  I set an elderly client I had once up with a linux install because they didn't want a new machine (they had XP era hardware).  They only had to come back once - and it wasn't for a problem, it was to tell me that that solution was working out great for them and to thank me for all my help.
If an elderly couple can use it, I don't think it's going to require a super nerd.
@_date: 2018-04-23 15:48:07


Being honest though, that describes most people.
I completely get what you're saying, and agree to an extent. At the same time, when it comes to software (like Office) the large companies are pushing for SaaS.  So sure... MS Office isn't on other OSes natively... until you boot up your browser.  Or, if people that know what they're doing are around, you can put PlayOnLinux or a VM on the machine for that.


What you're missing is the underlying workings.  They all use the linux kernel - and most of the ones you listed are variants of a single distribution which means the biggest decision you're going to need to make is what software you want by default.
Ignoring we're doing "Windows as a service" now, Windows 7 had starter, home basic, home premium, professional, enterprise, ultimate.  You've also got Starter N, Home Premium N, Professional N, Enterprise N, and Ultimate N. And K versions of the above. And KN versions of the above. That comes to a grand total of 24 versions between standard, N, K, and KN, all configured slightly differently.  ( N, K, and KN exist because MS was found guilty of violating anti-trust laws btw).
The answer to your question though is whichever version fits her needs the best. That's the beauty of an open OS environment vs closed.  If you want a minimalistic install, go for it.  Want one on Windows?  Good luck.


Yes, in most instances. Every now and then there's a formatting bug or something similar in opening a document - but it's usually not noticable.


No. It opens and saves in .docx.


That's already the case.  People familiar with a single OS are usually only familiar with that OS.  The older crowd for example don't want to migrate from XP because that's what they're used to.  They tried Vista and didn't get it.  Didn't get 7.  Didn't get 8 or 8.1.  And they don't understand how to use 10 either.  They don't touch macOS.  They *only* use computers with Windows XP.
And that comes down almost 100% to only understand one particular graphical desktop.  Know what I did to give those kinds of people a hand?  I tweaked the desktop environment on the linux distro to look identical to Windows XP.  All of a sudden those people can use two different OSes with no issues.
Don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to push linux or anything.  I've just used a ton of different OSes (both CLI and desktop environment based).  The best analogy is like cars.  There are a ridiculous amount of models out there.  Which do you buy?  First question is always "well what is it you need?"  Do you need speed? Reliability?  Security?  Stability?  Familiarity?  Ultimately, most are capable of doing what you want unless you have a specific requirement (racing, hauling extremely heavy loads, etc | server requirements, programming environments, etc)
The above really applies to all technology honesty.  Studies have shown that the first pieces of a particular type of technology a person uses is often the only one they will ever use.  You see it in cell phones (people only using flips, android, iOS), computers and tablets.  Its the main reason behind companies like Apple pushing to have Apple devices in schools.  It costs them money - but it secures brand loyalty from a **LOT** of people.
And we're going to see the exact same thing in Crypto spaces.  People are going to gravitate to what they learn first.  If they're introduced to one project and get used to it - they're probably not going to jump to another that might better suit their needs, whether that's an exchange, the actual crypto project, dapp, or whatever.  
The only time that changes is when more tech savvy people take the time to break things down and make something new familiar to them (making Mint look like Windows XP for example).

Maybe you should look into history, as well as what crimes your bank is charged with.  There are quite a few banks that regularly defraud their customers for instance.  Saying they "haven't lost my money" just professes the typical "it can't happen to me" response - which if you look at what they are up to isn't true.  They may not have screwed you - yet - but that doesn't mean that they won't.
Either way, if you want to trust them that's your choice - I'm just pointing out there is enough current and historical precedent backing people that don't, and plenty of problems with current currencies particularly in a digital society regardless of your personal feelings about bitcoin.  Bitcoin may or may not be a good answer to some of the problems - but the simple fact is an effort to fix current problems is the right direction to go regardless of whether the current type of cryptocurrency fails or not.
