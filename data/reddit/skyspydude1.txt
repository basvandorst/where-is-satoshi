Because the stock market as a whole has never recovered from downswings, and shitcoins never have people just take the money and run? The big issue with BTC/Altcoins is that they're almost permanently tied. BTC drops, so does everything else. If FB has an off day, the entire market doesn't go with it.

You're seriously comparing Cyprus, a country that literally has a GDP lower than Montana, to the US Stock Market?

I'm not even sure what job you're expecting me to do? You're trying to compare the markets of 2 countries that are literally 3 orders of magnitudes apart, and I'm just saying that the US Stock Market has always recovered from downswings.

Because when a bank gets hacked, they also lose all of my money, and it's impossible to get back. Fortunately, this has never happened in the history of crypto.


I'm sure that transaction times will never increase as adoption increases. Fortunately, this has never happened in the history of crypto.
Also, on that last note, this is only a problem in the US, which won't be an issue by the end of the year with the overhaul of the ACH system. Even now, my bank clears checks in 1 business day now, transfers from someone with the same bank are instantaneous, and this is just the start of the ACH overhaul.

My big issues, many of which are addressed in the article, is that while BFX/Tether might be on the up-and-up, they do a TERRIBLE job of making it look like that from the outside. A very opaque crytocurrency financial organization incorporating in the Caiman Islands looks incredibly suspicious.

It very much depends on when, as tax years are discreet from each other. AFAIK, unless you're a business, you can't make $100k one year and not pay taxes on it, lose it all the next year, and then claim no income.

Comparing the whopping 8 years the crypto market has existed, and the 150+ years the stock market has existed, and then trying to point at history? And please show me where the stock market hasn't recovered since 1929/1937/1973/1987/1990/2000/2008.
