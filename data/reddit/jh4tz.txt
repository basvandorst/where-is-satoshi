Are you guys even watching the Futures? It's being bid lower consistently and now sitting at 8.5k in March... It's getting lower every day; was like 10.5k two weeks ago.
It's being GAMED. WAKE UP. 
Watch the Futures. You'll know where bitcoin is going. It's that simple. You think they have been FUD'ing to scare people away from this 'fraudulent' imaginary money or to buy a shit tonne when the price drops so they can game it even easier? They'll pump when they go long (magic how it went to 20k before the Futures started, right?) and dump when they are shorting like now.

Here you are bud:
They are all gamed now. Currently I think the trend seems to be that money moving into crypto means that stocks will follow. Sounds counterintuitive I know but Goldman Sachs actually said it yesterday that crypto action is an indicator of how much risk the market wants to take on.
It could all change. It could all crash. Stay vigilante. Diversify. Look at the charts, especially the bond market. You'll know what to do then. 
Hope that helps. Peace.

At the moment huge sell offs in the bond market have pushed rates higher and the market is not liking it. Hence sell offs... The interesting thing at the moment that even in these small 'bumps' or corrections in the stock market, the cash is not really going anywhere. Commodities aren't moving yet, no safety play.... So at the moment bonds being bought up (only banks and central banks), pushes interest rates lower, which combined with the weaker dollar is stock market positive.
