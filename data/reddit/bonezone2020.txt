I don’t really know why people say so much about such a simple question, the answer is YES you can launder money with bitcoin l.

Sounds good, I’ll watch it!

Fuckk 
This takes too much time of my day plus I get bad sleep out of it. I want to join but I also want a daily check of the price. Right now I’m always looking at the 1minute buy/sell and it drives me crazy.
I’ll try not to look today.
Edit: I failed.
@_date: 2017-12-01 13:53:32
work? Maybe, profitable? No. 
Please go read more about mining and what it needs and understand that phone specs are not cutting it.
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:01:49
I thought you were talking about pay wall for bitcoin for some reason. So for stupid people like me - to read the article you need to register 
@_date: 2017-12-03 11:17:55
They have no proof. Just a link to a site where the file have been deleted. 
Breaking sha256 would have made the news. Or sold to the highest bidder.
Move on.
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:43:28
cex has really big fees, that’s why the prices are also a bit higher almost on everything. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:52:02
Not yet.. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 07:24:28
Would have been an ok post but with that last part it turned bad..
You answered yourself - only invest what you can lose. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 16:27:38
Does it also make the 2008 crash seem so cool and fun until the end where you understand how fucked up the situation have gotten?
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:06:28
how is that possible? 
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:53:13
Just out of curiosity, why does big blocks not scale? 
@_date: 2017-12-28 05:51:58
Wrong timing
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:07:10
Well right now we are shooting up
Edit never mind
@_date: 2017-12-02 13:05:46
that is somewhat true. Bitcoin at its current state plus the current state of cryptocurrency as a whole is all about speculation. It’s meant for buying a cup of coffee but it would take time until the market settles, and it might even settle with another coin. 
What’s important is bitcoin was and still the catalyst that started it all and it is still what holds it together (when bitcoin drops ALL of the alts drop) 
We are still in on the first levels of a new type of economy and currency change and it would take time for mass adoption for consumer use.
@_date: 2017-11-16 20:47:41
Oops.. I meant to post another link. 
I’ll fix it, thank you!
@_date: 2019-06-25 11:26:17
Nope. English isn’t my first language and we don’t learn how to read cursive here.
@_date: 2017-11-28 06:47:34
that is not a question for us but for you. 
Do you believe bitcoin in the long run? Do you believe the value is really representing bitcoin? 
Ask yourself what you are in for first.
@_date: 2017-11-21 13:31:48
Why do just an investor audit and not do one for the public? 
@_date: 2017-11-25 08:57:48
That can’t be true because bitcoin dipped below 8k in the past 3 days.. or are you talking about a huge dip
@_date: 2017-11-26 16:42:19

where you at
@_date: 2017-11-09 19:02:05
I’m stating to diversity. Some Alts are looking good.
@_date: 2017-11-03 08:48:33
I also hold bitcoin on coinbase. 
The thing is, you let a company control your wallet and your bitcoins - if they get hacked all of your money can be gone. 
Holding your money in your own wallet makes more sense for keeping it safe but the question I'm having is how will I get coins from the fork when it will happen if I'm on my own wallet? If anyone has an answer it would be great!
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:25:25
That’s a pump til bitcoin is on the ground type of pump and dump.
@_date: 2017-11-21 13:33:15
You don’t need proof against when you have no proof for. 
700 million dollars in tethers and no proof for banking of that size. 
That’s enough to spread fear around. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:37:25
Back down again. Here we go another loop.
@_date: 2017-11-12 21:05:44
Brutal stuff. I hope we get a bounce back tomorrow. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 11:22:20
I’m sure if you ask coinbase for more information about the insurance. 
Tether said they would publish an audit but still no audit. 
 
@_date: 2017-11-12 20:30:54
Amazing numbers guys.  2 new blocks. 24 transactions per second BUT were down from 170k

Digital currency is insured.
@_date: 2017-11-16 11:09:51
ok dude.
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:28:41
you are mostly right.  Bitcoin right now is not as the white paper wanted but the increase in demand has been huge. I personally thing bigger blocks could help bitcoin become again viable for day to day transactions without high fees which it was planned to be all along.
 But you are right that other tokens  would charge ahead and that’s because they are not a new monetary system but a new way to look at trust less systems and decentralized applications.
@_date: 2017-11-12 20:41:53
Days. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 11:38:18
This low is the big high of yesterday..
@_date: 2017-11-16 19:58:44
Start here: 
And continue down the rabbit hole if you like.
@_date: 2017-11-21 11:05:08
what are you even talking about. There are regulations on exchanges because they are using fiat. When you take out the real money and just use tokens “representing” money you also don’t need the regulation.
@_date: 2017-11-21 20:09:05
Can you still deposit fiat to bitfinex from us/Europe? I thought they stopped accepting 
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:24:33
Sounds right but for real I don’t have a clue. 
For all I know I could wake up to bch at 2500 tomorrow, it happened and it was scary AF.
@_date: 2017-11-09 18:39:54
I don’t know man.. I feel now it will take its time just cooling like that.
@_date: 2017-11-10 11:37:25
I sure hope so because 6800 is not a good number
@_date: 2017-11-09 15:01:22
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:09:10
Yes please
@_date: 2017-11-21 20:27:45
I happened on August and then in September and then about a week ago (November) that’s not once per quarter.
@_date: 2017-11-16 19:56:21
Which part? 
The one where USDT (tether) isn’t back by any dollar amount? 
The one that shows tether is literally created days/hours before bitcoin rises? 
The one that shows bitfinex is linked with tether? 
@_date: 2017-11-10 18:11:54
Just look at coin market cap of bch.. it’s a huge pump. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:27:48
Some exchanges are past that already
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:39:45
Damn kid. That’s a lot of money for a 14 
@_date: 2017-11-08 15:43:10
I’m asking that because I once had a wallet in coinbase but I live in a country where I can’t use coinbase (or GDAX) to sell so it’s not worth just for keeping coins because when you want to sell you’ll have to send to exchange and pay fees.
But if you plan on staying just get familiar with GDAX. It’s an exchange owned by coinbase.
@_date: 2017-11-16 20:07:38
The problem is absolutely counterfeit..
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:44:00
Yes please
@_date: 2017-11-12 20:54:17
As long as bitcoin is more profitable to mine then cash miners will continue to mind bitcoin and free up the pool. 
The pool is huge tough so it would take time. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 16:14:03
It’s actually called Black Friday sale..
@_date: 2017-11-26 09:07:28
The gif for 4000$ was so good.
@_date: 2017-11-13 12:44:07
Nah dude. This is a mistake. 
Don’t buy with money you can’t afford to lose.
@_date: 2017-11-11 13:00:50
And cex is 200$ more on btc/usd 
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:21:38
first thing - nobody knows. 
My gut feeling - there will be a correction/whatever you call it tonight, maybe with a bit of a bch hype or something..
But again, nobody knows what’s going on right now.
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:24:32
It is a short term game but it could end bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 20:04:41
How is that a correction I still don’t understand. Seems more like an attack.
@_date: 2017-11-19 20:21:22
Not so fast. It will take time.
@_date: 2017-11-21 07:00:12
how would you handle this tether thing? Just ignore it?
@_date: 2017-11-09 19:03:51
The future is looking good in terms of mainstream adoption. 
I’m still not sure what is going to be done with the high fees and all of that but hope for the best.
@_date: 2017-11-16 10:21:56
@_date: 2017-11-16 20:52:23
Well let’s see what happens next I guess? 
Did he give a timeframe to the audit?
@_date: 2017-11-05 06:09:39
cex but don't buy from the buy/sell section (huge fees) buy from the trade section. You have to validate your card (checksum validation) and it has a 300 dollar limit a day.
@_date: 2017-11-21 13:23:50
And by the way how is showing a bank statement that can be spoofed is the same to seeing a bitcoin address with said amounts of bitcoins?
@_date: 2017-11-21 11:25:33
because the way they operate seems better to me then using tokens that represent usd with no backing behind it. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:22:28
people are now understanding no free coins 
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:28:43
my question now is how do you drive the fees back to something normal. You can’t use bitcoin as a currency right now for small things.
@_date: 2017-11-16 11:40:49
Listen. 
Amazon knows there a market for btc acceptance. They don’t need a change.org petition to tell them that. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 17:35:21
When it was 6400 I was. I’m comfortable with 6500 for now.
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:31:44
Too late. Going past that
@_date: 2017-11-12 20:47:16
Edit: yeah now I see. Last block almost an hour ago..
That doesn’t change the fact the some big miners are coming back to btc because of money, that’s the only thing here
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:09:44
@_date: 2017-11-08 15:24:03
can you use coinbase to sell those bitcoins or do you use it only as a wallet?
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:34:11
Not over yet. 
And also most of the alts.
@_date: 2017-11-16 19:15:15
show me where it says you are backed by real US dollars for tethers. 
It clearly says in the website it’s not backed by any real fiat. It’s not backed by any institution, bitfinex lost connections with banking.
Real this: 
This will explain pretty good the uptrend of bitcoin RIGHT NOW
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:43:31
Yeah I’m joking they are some sell orders on high numbers that were set before the news broke so it’s selling but I think most people who are actively watching don’t sell.
@_date: 2017-11-28 06:14:31
It’s ok. 
If you believe in it I’m sure when you’ll have money you will return. 
Also, try and convince whoever takes your rent to get paid in bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-11 20:38:18
I really hope so. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 20:55:00
What was your last buy in?
@_date: 2017-11-16 08:02:11
7700 in cex
@_date: 2017-11-21 10:05:14
I own bitcoin. I’m concerned about tether.
Why are you so quick to dismiss such a big issue effecting the future on the currency/cryptocurrency?
@_date: 2017-11-12 21:12:25
Yep. But while the unconfirmed transactions are coming down also the price is..
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:01:09
yes. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 10:27:12
What? You can pump the prices with way less. Big buy orders above the current price makes for fomo buying a
@_date: 2017-11-16 08:33:25
I’ve been following bitcoin a lot longer and I’ve never seen a bigger attack on the coin. It was not just the lay of the land..

It goes way too fast.. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 20:21:53
The mempool is still growing. 174450 unconfirmed. 19 transactions per second. 
5 blocks now. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 10:25:21
Sign up for monero instead. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 08:02:55
No. They were scary as fuck
@_date: 2017-11-21 11:12:29
Because they lost all banking and use tether? 
@_date: 2019-06-25 08:29:11
Damn. 
When did you guys start investing
@_date: 2017-11-17 05:27:03
Huge backlog of unconfirmed transactions was caused by miners switch to bch (bitcoin cash) because it was more profitable to mine. 
Now it takes time to clean it up.
@_date: 2017-11-21 11:09:28
cex.io 
Coinbase/GDAX 
Europe/American companies regulated.
@_date: 2017-11-21 13:22:57
Nope. 
Link it please.
@_date: 2017-11-29 07:43:31
Which country? 
you can try to use cex.io, they also have some fees but less then that coinmama site.
@_date: 2017-11-25 08:55:32
Link to YouTube channel? 
@_date: 2017-11-21 11:06:55
no. I don’t use bitfinex and don’t trust them.
I do think coinbase have every bitcoin for example.
@_date: 2017-11-17 08:22:22
I really don’t think so.
@_date: 2017-11-27 06:33:11
Listen. People will sell, people will buy.
10k is a big big number but also was 5k when it was hit and 2k. 
Go see what happened there and make up your mind. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 18:43:51
615 million 
@_date: 2017-11-12 20:45:01
Yeah that’s also inevitable
@_date: 2017-11-21 11:13:37
I meant to say that bitfinex lost banking and is not accepting any fiat and they are using tether. 
Two big reasons to not use them.
@_date: 2017-11-21 12:31:54
I don’t store my bitcoins on those exchanges. I just use them. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 13:09:56
I actually prefer it as a currency but seeing the fees and not fixes I would like it to be placed higher.
@_date: 2017-11-16 19:11:32
Also read this: 
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:29:32

But you get the cardboard box. When you get tether maybe you are getting air? 
@_date: 2017-11-27 19:43:28
Buy a better mentality
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:42:19
Why? They didn’t want a split they wanted a takeover and they didn’t get it so it’s off for now.
@_date: 2017-11-16 11:10:45
Nah that’s not the reason. Sorry to disappoint. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 13:27:34
And what do you say about the first part which says it’s for internal use? 
It sounds so fishy. Way more fishy then partial bitcoin accounts.
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:44:44
No free coins = no free money = sell at ATH..
@_date: 2017-11-27 06:50:19
he just told you people were selling at 1k because they thought it was the highest it would get.
@_date: 2017-11-12 21:09:57
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:26:11
Definitely change pow
@_date: 2017-11-16 20:04:17
In a nutshell yes. 
“Printing” money -&gt; lending it -&gt; getting btc for it -&gt; cashing out at high prices.
“Printing” money -&gt; making large bid/ask which will make it look like it’s going up -&gt; never completing those bid/ask or buying/selling to yourself (bitfinex let’s you do it) -&gt; driving prices up -&gt; cashing out at high prices.
@_date: 2017-11-19 20:18:52
Tether is a real issue more people need to hear about.
How is it ok to say you back it 1 to 1 and now show any audits or banking.. it’s almost 700 million dollars.
@_date: 2017-11-16 20:49:25
Like it was audited?
@_date: 2017-11-21 13:30:03
Then let’s wait and see when this audit releases.. right now there is no proof for tether. 
150k  bitcoins &gt; 0 usd in tether ? 
Let’s just wait for the final audit. I’m willing to give it the benefit of the doubt but not for long. They keep “Printing” tethers like crazy. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 20:13:16
You can send me some bitcoins to my address I’ll sell you some.
@_date: 2017-11-16 20:13:41
What? What are you talking about.. the whole marketing plan is saying it’s backed by a bank account which has the same amount of USD.
Bitfinex and tether are losing banking relationships. But somehow tethers are still being created.
@_date: 2017-11-21 20:29:09
Coinbase is an American exchange - GDAX.
Bitstamp is a Luxembourg exchange . 
@_date: 2017-11-12 20:26:44
Yeah it’s going up and down but slowly down because more and more miners are coming back. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 15:00:11
Why would it? I’m sure there are still a lot of people that thought they were getting free coins and now after the call of sell their coins.
@_date: 2017-11-21 07:10:11
what would you do with tether right now.. there is a token backed by USD (or supposedly) and it’s growing to be a huge thing. 
In the post it sounds like you want people not to talk about tether so I’m asking what would you do with that problem that just with 30 million “stolen” made bitcoin + all the alts dip.
@_date: 2017-11-16 11:32:14
Nope. 
I think there is price manipulation (pumping) from bitfinex right now followed by people jumping on this sailing ship not knowing it will hit an iceberg soon and go back to normal price. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 13:20:23
Because bitcoin cash seems fishy as fuck. Especially with all the pumping right now it. I don’t like how it’s handled and it doesn’t feel like an organic thing.
@_date: 2017-11-05 08:33:33
I don't think you'll be making any real money soon with a 500$ miner. You better off buying bitcoin at 500 and hope it goes up.
@_date: 2017-11-21 16:15:40
Nah.. the world doesn’t revolve around this subreddit and most of the buying is automatic

Because I want it to be valued higher? I have confidence in bitcoin right now even do all I see is red.
@_date: 2017-11-16 09:32:42
Attack = market manipulation = pump and dump
All the same thing. Designed to make money and if it works make bch which was more centralized the biggest coin. 
I wasn’t even talking about the downvotes because I don’t care about that stuff. It’s all about the money.
@_date: 2017-11-21 13:05:27
Because the entire tether system is based on nothing while you can at least see some coins stored on wallets for exchanges
@_date: 2017-11-21 10:39:24
Do you really believe that if a price on one of the biggest exchanges goes above everyone prices will not adjust in other exchanges? And do you really think there are no arbitrage trading going on? 
That’s just stupid to think exchanges don’t follow prices.
@_date: 2017-11-21 16:20:22
how do you know it was actually stolen? 
What proof do you get beside this wallet has 30 million and now we’ve blocked them. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 07:38:07
Don’t use that site. The fees are way too high.

For that to happen you need miners to actually make money from that. Right now they are making more on the other side. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 18:32:25
YES YES AND MORE YES.
People need to be more informed about this fake money the keeps flowing in and how it is used in bitfinex to bump the price. 
Please read about it, please share it. 
Here are some links to get more informed:

that’s not the problem. I can use it right now sure but I’m talking long term the effect creating tokens and buying with them bitcoins will have.
I’m not from USA or europe so nope (?)

12 blocks in 1 hour for bitcoin. 
0 blocks in 1 hour for cash. 
Coming off the 167000~ mark of unconfirmed transactions 
Coming of the 6K $ mark
@_date: 2017-11-05 13:47:51
Yeah, next notification 7650.
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:40:28
I only see green arrows

@_date: 2017-11-25 12:56:41
That means that the next one is in almost two weeks. But that could change, plus the % can change also. 
Why are you asking, that’s the more important question.
@_date: 2017-11-01 07:19:19
It will happen on block 494,784. We are on block 492,593 right now.
You can see what block is the latest block here - 
@_date: 2017-11-16 09:15:59
1. How much did you buy it for
2. How many coins do you have
3. Are you willing to lose money on bch right now and maybe make it back when/if pumping starts again (big if!!)
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:42:10
It started on bitfinex. 
Volume of 3117.27 dropped it from 11220 to 10075
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:12:19
when people see a dip they always assume that means the other coin is going up which makes it go up but as soon as bitcoin goes back up bch is sold. 
It’s a game of money changing just to get the max value: 
- sell btc at high
- buy bch at low 
- sell bch at high/ exchange bch at high on btc on low
- get btc back

The iceberg is the exit point for the pumping that is done. I don’t know how much “money”/tethers they have but. 
High jumps in value like this come with the regular dose of dumping. 
Read more about bitfinex+tethers scam..
@_date: 2017-11-16 18:59:35
This will be so relevant when the pump stops and the dump starts.. 
I don’t really know how to share this post more.
@_date: 2017-11-11 14:06:52
Yes. From 66 to 110 in a day. That’s a new ATH! (��)
@_date: 2017-11-12 20:50:30
I think it will be a very very mad night..
A lot of people are just cashing out.
@_date: 2017-11-12 10:12:30
Yes. It is something else. 
This week is a week we will all Remember 
@_date: 2017-11-21 10:54:27
Bitfinex - 8178
GDAX - 8190
Bitstamp - 8159
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:24:06
Because most people are watching the price drops and not the mempool go up..
@_date: 2017-11-02 07:19:22
Cex is really getting up there while some exchanges stay below 7000s
@_date: 2017-11-27 20:33:09
You can send me some bitcoins to my address I’ll sell you some.
@_date: 2017-11-25 13:00:15
@_date: 2017-11-21 20:46:50
I don’t understand the question. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 07:54:56
Wow, how is that? The price of one btc on cex is 11,000 right now and I’ve used coinmama and had huge fees. 
11,100 is not that bad but you are starting at a higher price then market. 
If you can buy locally it would be better because you wouldn’t pay fees at all.
@_date: 2017-11-11 13:28:42
Nothing natural but bitcoin came from something. Bitcoin cash right now is weird. Right after segwit2x shits down it skyrockets and then plummets?
@_date: 2019-06-25 05:42:50
OP can you write the contents of the letter in text, I seriously can’t understand half of the words written
@_date: 2017-11-16 11:13:38
There is a lot of money to be made from faking transitions from btc to bch and the opposite. 
bch as a project is not going anywhere but bch as a pump and dump dumpster is still here waiting I think.
@_date: 2017-11-21 06:58:54
No. How can. Price drop like that with a outage. Also. If you look coinmakretcap which looks up all the coins in most exchanges you will see it happened in almost every currency. 
I’m thinking 30 million tethers being “stolen” dropped bitcoin which made most alts drops (but not dash for some strange reason)
@_date: 2017-11-21 13:36:05
Because when you cash out bitcoins or any other alt coin on bitfinex you get paid in those tokens? 
@_date: 2017-11-11 12:58:20
Nope. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 20:14:33
3 blocks created it 3 minutes. 
It will take time to close the gap. 175K transactions are a lot. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 10:14:40
how will it blow away if people continue ignoring the huge amounts of tether being printed without any proof of 1 to 1 backing? 
 Bitcoin price is rising and it’s sometimes rising exactly after the printings - that’s concerning.

Segway is not dead, it just became a competitor to hover boards. And also bought by Xiaomi.
@_date: 2018-02-15 19:35:17
I don’t understand why would that happen. What’s the Appeal of cashing out *five hours* before new year..
@_date: 2018-02-17 17:25:13
What’s the capital gains tax? I’m planning on moving to Canada and I have some crypto I want to cash out
@_date: 2018-02-22 14:36:38
What moves the price is people selling and people buying at certain prices
@_date: 2018-02-02 06:03:09
Why are they clueless? 
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:41:14
At what price did you get in?
@_date: 2018-02-03 17:36:51
Where Can I see find it on the site? I can’t seem to see a date for this update or find it in press or announcement thingy for their site, or on twitter
@_date: 2018-02-06 05:02:56
Tweet from July 2017. I don’t understand...
Ohhh it’s a reposter not, makes sooo much sense 
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:47:37
So please sell some.
@_date: 2017-10-31 06:44:37
Can you explain that? I always thought it was working the same way
@_date: 2018-02-03 17:41:39
Yeah I know. Other than this link.. where is it linked from
@_date: 2018-02-17 10:24:35
Hey! What’s the crypto situation in Canada? How’s the tax and everything
@_date: 2018-02-05 09:32:54
When did you get in?
@_date: 2018-02-02 06:34:00
Oh. It’s OBVIOUSLY not what’s causing it? 
What is OBVIOUSLY causing it then? 
@_date: 2017-10-31 15:56:56
Is there a timeframe of when will it happen?
@_date: 2018-02-03 21:17:44
�� yeah I knew something wasn’t right
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:10:08
When did you get in? 
@_date: 2018-02-22 19:17:22
Because how it works in israel currency can be called currency if it’s backed by israel or by another country which israel recognizes as a country. So crypto can’t be taxed as currency.
@_date: 2017-10-31 06:59:46
But what's stopping the miners from doing what they want? 
@_date: 2017-10-31 16:04:48
Thanks! 
Also the site says: 
"Bitcoin is upgrading (forking) on or around December 31, 1969, 7:00 pm EST based on the SegWit2X code on block height 494784. " which is pretty weird
