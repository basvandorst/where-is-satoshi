Interesting post. Your opsec is quite bad and it is quite easy to reconstruct a lot of your history. You were looking to buy 1500 BTC in 2012 on bitcointalk.
Probably you sold some and gambled some away in altcoins. I would hope you still have around 300-500.
@_date: 2019-07-14 15:35:05
Oh my.. still these gullible people around that believe in TA. Will it ever stop?
@_date: 2019-07-14 17:02:18
Just a guesstimate. Happy to learn about an example where you buy 20$ of bitcoin and do 2 transactions without ending up with less than 10$.

Why would anyone buy Bitcoin for 20$? You lose already 50% in fees for doing nothing with it.
@_date: 2019-07-20 14:12:39
Another information from one of your old blog posts says that you had a bit more than 400 BTC in March 2011.

And it will be a slow process to find the private keys. Possibly with some new type of mining pools. 
It wont happen that all of Satoshi's keys are revealed from one day to the other.

The reason for people losing trust in bitcoin was that this was exactly the time blocks started to be full:

The only volume that increased is BTC-XMR. The volume BTC-USD has not changed since a long time and is still at less than 1 BTC per day.

"Nobody" is not to be taken literally and I would be happy if more people would use BISQ.
However, CAD-BTC has rather been going down and is at 300 CAD/day:
USD-BTC is at 3000 USD/day since 2017.
It is not exactly nobody using it, but for a global project it looks like something is not working.
@_date: 2019-07-20 17:39:11
Maybe I misunderstand your post. Here you claim that you bet 350 USD on Bitcoin growing when it was at 0.8 USD/BTC:

For the efficient market to work it just requires a few people to understand the halving and having an estimate of how many people dont understand. 
Not everyone needs to understand the implications of the halving. That's the beauty of efficient markets.

Who cares about a few blocks with artificially generated transactions? Normal blocks are never reaching 2 MB.

A "full node" that probably less than 1% of bitcoiners use? 
And the ones that use it are using it for 1 transaction per year to move BTC to their HODL-wallet?
Sure, you are controlling the network. Nobody cares whether your node rejects a block.
@_date: 2019-08-21 17:16:39
Normal blocks are 1.2 MB at most.
Edit: It looks like some people try to spread some fake narrative by pointing out a few artificial blocks with non-standard transaction patterns that are bigger than 1.2 MB.

I dont own bch. But I dislike people spreading false information. 
If you dont run an economic node, it doesn't matter whether it is forwarding transactions or not.

Bitcoin hashrate is 100 Exahash/s = 100 Million Terahashes/s.
An antminer S17 with 50 Terahashes/s costs 2000 USD.
This means without electricity it costs you at least 4 billion USD. If that happens, it probably takes less than a week for bitcoin to change the hash algorithm and you gain nothing.

1. Addresses that are not being re-used are expected to be safe against quantum attacks.
2. Getting the required computation power will be a slow process. Cracking the keys will take years in the beginning. You will hear about a successfully cracked private key years before someone cares about your 0.5 BTC.
3. Long before (2) happens, bitcoin code will be adapted to be protected from the attack.

Even with 10 MB blocks everyone can afford to run a full node in case the network is under attack.
