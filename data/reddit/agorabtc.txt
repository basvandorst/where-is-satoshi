The price of bitcoin doesn't matter.
Using the currency simply as a vehicle to move value simply involves the buying of however much bitcoin is needed to represent that value. Ergo regardless of price it is an effective measure of value.
It is also an effective store of value. Yes, as adoption increases so will the price, but if you look at curves of adoption you can see it can only ever completely expand to fill a given economy, and thereby will eventually top out in price (of course, loss of bitcoins and other externalities will push this slightly higher over time). 
What you have then is not that "bitcoin is too expensive" for people, but that "early adopters are freaking rich." It still remains possibly the most effective store of value mankind has ever devised.
(Side note, how can we justify that a small number of people become ludicrously wealthy via hodling (sp) this asset? Sounds like a ponzi scheme, right? Wrong. While a ponzi scheme redistributes wealth without any benefit to most of the people who are participating, the increasing adoption of bitcoin is an amazing addition of utility to anyone that uses it. Early adopters are thus rewarded by being the first to support and legitimize this new system)
In terms of fees, who cares? The majority of transactions (person to person and person to institution) will definitely take place outside of the blockchain, simply because it's very cost effective to use centralized systems to do that. The blockchain will likely be used for clearing transactions between large parties like institutions or governments, since it's such a beautiful system.
Individuals can still run a full node, and this is very useful for making sure that large entities are completely transparent. Transaction fees will likely disappear, honestly, since these institutions will most likely end up doing most of the mining, and simply absorb the cost of running the hardware. To avoid collusion (double spending and the like) no single or few institutions should be allowed to host the majority of mining power. That's easy enough to legislate and monitor.
Whew, what a post! Hope this clears some things up.

In addition, if you remove the 25btc inflation occurring every block, cost per transaction is even lower. IMHO the blockchain metric linked above doesn't provide very useful information.

This is brilliant, sebicas. When the actions of an asset like bitcoin have an effect on THEIR business they suddenly challenge it for being an "unfair" asset? This illustrates how disgustingly capitalistic and unfair apparently unbiased companies can have on the trust or value of global assets.

You were not employed as a financial adviser, ergo it is impossible you could give financial advise under the authority of the company. Whether baseball or bitcoin it's all just free, casual speech.

Please refer to my posts on the other thread. Tl;dr, there is no reason "Gems" cannot be denominated in terms of bitcoin. The fact that they do not indicates either ignorance of the decentralized and trustless infrastructure they are trying to capitalize on, or a willful disregard utilized to steal money.
Either way, even considered as a stock this platform doesn't even have workable software implemented as of yet! Valuation and therefore investment should be reserved until some sort of product worthy of valuation is presented.
Satoshi didn't present bitcoin without a software implementation to improve on. Why should the community accept this kind of dismissive handwaving in exchange for btc?

Tl;dr: bitcoin is incredible.
In slightly more detailed terms: blah blah banking system sucks, blah blah new asset class, blah blah wow.
This is legitimately an asset that has survived the rigors of going from niche bullshit money to legitimate secured money. Nothing like this has ever happened and there is a good chance it will succeed in place of traditional assets.

It looks like Gems has taken the crowdsourcing nature of Counterparty but then perverted it by using the shares as it's in-app currency, EFFECTIVELY creating an app-coin.
Whether the shares are denominated using Counterparty or cryptorgraphy (like in an alt-coin), it still acts like an alt-coin or app-coin.
If the Counterparty shares were separated from the app (aka by using bitcoin directly as the in-app currency), this might be a promising project.

I can see Coinbase, Circle, even some of the exchanges evolving into a new class of banks.
Providing easy to access, suitably regulated (according to fiat BS) portals between fiat and btc, leveraging the power and innovation of the blockchain to create stock markets or whatever, and serving as an insured, trusted third party for the less technically inclined brings a LOT of value not only to bitcoin but to the companies themselves.
Decentralization can be great. Centralization can be great. These systems have the opportunity to leverage the best of both worlds.

That's all well and good, but ultimately there is no TECHNICAL decision requiring the creation of a separately tradeable and differentiable asset within the app. It would work equally as well with a bitcoin backing demoninated in whatever you deemed socially acceptable "USD, GEMS", whatever, as long as the back end was handled in bitcoin. Your entire system could literally stay the exact same to the end user, but be ultimately reconciled within the bitcoin system.
There is zero benefit/loss from doing this, and until this application does, I have zero belief that this is in the best interest of a decentralized currency.

Have you not looked up how much power is consumed? There are better algorithms. Banking is a cool thing. When I first heard of it I thought it'd be this cool way to have third parties control the economy and secure my wealth. Electricity comes at a large environmental cost and the power consumption will always be proportional to the banking system's usage. Sad.

The best approximation of your decision, Moe, is like allowing Christian scientists to speak at a Biology conference. Yes, it's all well and good that we get to hear and debate their opinions, but as a whole it not only takes away from the legitimacy but also the goal of the conference, which is to discuss and improve the field.
Ultimately the decision you have made is not necessarily a BAD one, just one with different repercussions. I respect that you've taken a stand, and one that leans toward the freedom of speech.
