Enlighten me. If I've bought bitcoin and sent it to my own wallet immediately after receiving, there's no issue. I don't follow the news or price as closely as I have in the past.
@_date: 2017-01-02 14:13:22
For real though what was the issue with circle and/or coinbase? I used them a bit and just transfered my bitcoin out right away.

That very well may be true but how many transactions have you completed with BTC? I think this is a relevant question
@_date: 2015-04-08 03:02:39
I just donated $1 and it's asking for the other $19.16 for the minimum $20.16 donation amount. haha they can't charge me to get my Bitcoin!

This is correct. People don't understand how powerful they are as a group with common goals.
I once heard that the American Revolution occurred with only 1/3 of the population in favor of independence, 1/3 in favor of staying with the empire, and 1/3 indifferent.

My experience with Circle is great so far. No problems. The only problem I have is that on my phone when I'm completing a buy, it asks for my 2FA code. I go to grab the number but when I go back to the Circle app and resubmit all my info the 2FA code has changed...

Not sure what this means, I can't use any of my Bitcoin from this address because of this. I contacted their support and haven't gotten any help.
@_date: 2015-02-18 19:04:00
I disagree with OP. My first experience with circle was great. Right now I will use Circle over Coinbase simply because they allow access to some of the BTC instantly after purchasing.
@_date: 2015-02-18 12:24:24
Thanks for all of the info. I do live in the US and the paper will focus on US/populations (Idk why I put university instead of college).  
Much of the urban poor populations are currently working/earning money of the books to survive.  The vast majority already don't report their earnings to the govt. 
Bitcoin could have a larger effect than you realize due to this fact. 
Bloodsucking gangs/extortionists could possibly have a more difficult time taking their cut of earnings of BTC because it can be hidden more effectively than cash.
I may use some of your insight in my essay. Do you have any sources which you took some info from (for bibliography purposes?) 
Also I can just refer to your reddit username when I use your ideas.
Thanks a bunch you really helped me out. 500 bits @_date: 2015-03-26 18:39:44

I tried this for fun with my blockchain wallet about a month ago. the transaction didn't go through and I could NOT use any of my Bitcoin in that wallet. About 1.5 days after initiating the transaction blockchain.info dropped the transaction and then i could use my money. So always include a fee if u want to be able to use your wallet
@_date: 2015-03-06 12:34:09

That's a great idea. I actually kept the private key in case the waiter throws out the wallet. Next time I visit the restaurant I will ask if he kept it. He's an elderly Japanese man I wonder what he'll do with it
@_date: 2015-02-16 16:09:56
Thank you this is very helpful. I guess it's just a waiting game now.  I was experimenting with fees and such. I now see a serious problem on the consumer side. Is there anyway to attach an Xfee afterwards? I can't do anything with my wallet as of now.
