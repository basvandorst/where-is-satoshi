I didn't miss the point. I was just winding japanese_cat up.  
To say that someone should be ashamed of themselves because they used the same username on a few different online accounts is a ridiculous way to go about educating people. It would have been more effective if he had just said "You know it's a good idea to use a different username for all your accounts to increase the chances of staying secure". Instead, he took the dickhead route.

Your point is well taken :)

Great, pleased to hear I don't need to be scared. I was worried there for a moment that someone was going to steal all my bitcoins ;)
I'll work on my guilt-reflex to ensure I'm suitably ashamed of such irresponsible behaviour going forward.

Why should I be scared to say this in public?
I don't have any alleged intelligence and don't offend easily so feel free to be perfectly honest :)

I received the email from Kraken. 
I use the same username on Bitfinex, moneypot, bitvest, bitcointalk, and possibly some other I can't think of at the moment.

Using the same Username and Password would be pretty bad obviously. But using the same username, very strong/distinct passwords, and 2 factor authentication doesn't seem like the biggest sin in the world. I could be wrong though, my accounts may about to be emptied of the small amount of bitcoin they contain :D
