Bitcoin's market cap was about $40 million this time last year. Bitcoin could have a $20 billion market cap next year at that growth rate. Or it could be zero. 
Speculation by saving is every bit as important as speculation by trade. Those of us saving are helping to increase demand by making bitcoins a little harder to get. Those that spend increase bitcoin's velocity in the market. Those that trade on the exchanges add liquidity to the market. 
And all without the bony, grimy hands of banks and governments.

The danger of sending your bitcoins to someone else for a contracted period is that you have no recourse should someone run off with your bitcoins or should the business you've invested in fail.

I'm of the opinion that Satoshi assured the success of Bitcoin by deep-sixing many of the original mined coins. He doesn't have the keys to them and no one will ever have those coins. 
If approx. one million coins are gone, that's a little under 10% of existing coinstock that will never be on the market, thus increasing the value of remaining coins.

Do you like being wrong a lot or something?
The Fed creates money whenever it feels like it. There's no end to how many FRNs can be created.
There will only ever be 21 million bitcoins. Whether they're broken down into 2.1 quadrillion units or 21 quintillion units is of no matter. There are still only 21 million bitcoins on the blockchain.
If bitcoins are being subdivided, it's because they're worth more. Dollars come into existence because they're worth less, creating a need for more dollars and devaluing all of them even more when created. 
@_date: 2013-03-31 05:00:01


You're wrong...again.
What gives Bitcoin value is its transactional capabilities, its unbending measure of worth (unlike easily manipulable fiat) and the accounting system of the network. 


Again, you're wrong.

You can always check  and search for any Bitcoin address.
 is a similar service to brainwallet but both are very useful in generating addresses to use for cold storage wallets, also known as paper wallets. These wallets are used for longterm storage of your bitcoins and are never used as day to day spending wallets but only as a sending wallet.
Both sites can be downloaded and saved to your local drive and used offline. You should always do this when generating new addresses as you never want the private key exposed to any network interface. Ideally, you'd generate the addresses via the above website on an old laptop that has no network connection and transfer the public address  via text file on a USB drive to your online computer (or you can type the whole thing out from the offline machine's screen...not a lot of fun)  where you can send bitcoins to fund the address.
The offline computer holds your private keys. It's a good idea to print out the private keys on paper and put a copy somewhere trusted. Later, you can import the private key into the satoshi client or any other decent Bitcoin software or service.

You are completely correct. Only a fool would argue against this.
My point, poorly made, is that the relationship between miners and clients is a naturally cooperative one. The coins in a miner's block reward would be worth far less without the many, many non-mining clients that are, as you said, worthless in an attack but priceless just by the fact that more people are learning how to use the clients and add traffic to the network.

You can't fuck over the big boys like you fuck over the little guys, Pete. I hope you get a few more comeuppances and get the fuck out of Bitcoin.

As the market stands, those coins are worth the market price. If someone buys a bunch of coins and drives the price up, those coins will be worth more.
Yes, if the owner sold all at once, they'd fall in value as he sold. If he sold over the course of years, those coins will be worth tens of times more.

Coinsachs is bad for the Bitcoin system as it actively attaches personal info to every Bitcoin address it sells. It's part of their business plan.


I hear just as many complaints about Coinsachs as I've heard about all the other scams. I trust Goldman Sachs to be able to run a scam that falls within legal limits.

Part of the source is Bruce Schneier, who literally wrote the book on Applied Cryptography in the 90's:

It's a lot to take in but once you learn it, you're set.
edit: I took video out. Wrong one.  Let me look around.

Where did I say my deposit amount was an issue?
That's a poor tracking system if that's the case in some deposits, btw.
edit, because jaequery changed his post:
I have no idea how bitfloor keeps track of its deposits. Not my job. I gave them money and am not seeing my deposit on their exchange and have received little to no information from them.

Sorry. Hard to tell sometimes. I suffer from the same problem sometimes.

It means there's a high risk they'd either lose money on your price or there's a high risk that they might not make as much on you as they could the next guy.

Bitcoin-qt is the original bitcoin client that downloads, reads, verifies and stores the blockchain. It connects to the Bitcoin network, conducts transactions and routes Bitcoin traffic.
blockchain.info is a website created by someone in order for people to interface with the Bitcoin network. All of the information about the Bitcoin network (transactions, addresses, etc) on blockchain.info is available via the Bitcoin-qt client.
Just my opinion, but using Bitcoin-qt as my wallet is safer than using blockchain.info for a wallet.

Back at ya!
I'm teaching my kids (a seven year old, a ten year old and a teenager) about Bitcoin. It's amazing how fast they pick up on it and how much sense it makes to them while adults around them are still puzzled by email. ; )

Yay! Cheap coins!

If someone were to create a subreddit called r/Bitcoinhelp or some such, as an old hand at Bitcoin I'd be happy to help anyone that can ask civilly. 
If a subreddit for Bitcoin Help were to be created, I also promise to visit it a few times a day and do what I can. It can maddening learning Bitcoin but it also teaches patience. ; )

I guess a rich industrialist took exception to your comment.

Yes. It looks as though Bitcoin will drop to $10 tonight. Sell now.
