Still though, even if every security protocol were cracked, it's just an accounting change to adjust databases back to where they were.  I don't think that can so easily be done with bitcoin.

I don't believe that.   It's just a switch to different encryption for everything else and some accounting changes.

It just appears to me that this would be event based and unrecoverable.  So let's say the vulnerability happens and the algorithm is changed.  Well then no one can spend their coins because verification of ownership is based on the old algorithm.  If the old algorithm is enabled so people could spend their coins and switch to the new algorithm then you couldn't tell if it was them spending the coins or someone using the vulnerability.  
So changing the algorithm after the event would be useless.

SHA256 appears to be used in more than just mining.  I don't understand the process honestly but ultimately I'm getting at the cryptography used to verify you want to move coins to a different address.  What could be done if that were broken to the point where anyone that knew of this vulnerability could spend your coins?  Is there a way to recover from this if it were to happen?

This isn't quite what I'm talking about.  Quantum computing would be a brute force crack.  I'm wondering what would happen if someone figured out a weakness in the flavor of sha256 bitcoin uses that didn't require brute force.  
What could be done to keep people from using this vulnerability to steal your coins?
I know the normal thing to do is argue that it's impossible but let's just imagine that it did happen.  What could we do ahead of time if this was discovered to go back to a known good state or somehow prevent massive theft?

Why not have 2 parts to the ATM?  One part on the side that shows the videos and explains things and another part just to make the transaction.  People new could watch the videos/instructions and the experienced could get straight to the transaction.
Edit:  Oh yeah, there should be a ball washer while you're waiting too.  Everyone likes to have clean balls.  Maybe put that in the back though.
