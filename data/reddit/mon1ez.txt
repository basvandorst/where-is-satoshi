You need to ask a lawyer not us.
Depends, if it's a mail order cannabis service (yes these legally exist for some dispensaries) then you could have big problems.
Can't the dispensary just go on localbitcoins and buy their own?

There's been a big warning not to do any biz with Bitfloor on bitcointalk in the scam warning forums for ages. They are insolvent, and eventually somebody is going to get pissed and sue them out of existence. You all are crazy using that exchange

I get the XKCD password ref, my cromag mind cannot understand what you did there though

Yes, look around for countries that are "blacklisted" and dont have a US tax exhange treaty like Seychelles and some others. Your best bet is gold or a paper bitcoin wallet tho

It's probably because of fraud. OkPay does a lot of "soft" bank transfers, like Sofort online banking which can be easily frauded when loaded into a bitcoin exchange, and the fraudster runs off with untraceable coins.

Look at all the payment methods OKpay accept, a lot of them can be frauded easily. So if you're accepting "soft" bank transfers, like online banking xfers, and stuff like Ukash (which has been frauded galore in the past) then you're at high risk that fraudsters will use your OKpay service to move fraud funds into exchanges to get untraceable coins.
I'm betting they will add a whole lot more payment methods soon like more online banking and probably Chinese web wallets like Alipay, and don't want the fraud, thus kiebash on the bitcoin biz.
OKpay's correspondent banks probably don't want them handling Bitcoin either. without jacking up their rates because of high risk transactions.

LR was centralized and doomed eventually. The owners are all shady Russian FSB informants, I guess the FSB finally sold them out to the US for whatever reason.
Their mistake was 
1) allowing Americans to use their service
2) living in countries with an extradition treaty with the US
All the US had to do was wait for their new FinCen regulations to come into effect and then go after foreign companies that do biz with Americans without a license. Next will be Perfectmoney, possibly HDmoney, CGold and I forsee many European bitcoin exchanges who do biz with Americans receiving some extraordinary rendition to the US to stand trial for operating without a license. Total BS, but that's how American LE has always behaved should've learned from E-Gold and E-Bullion's mistakes.
LR didn't touch any money either, they contracted out everything to 3rd party exchangers (except for ExchangeZone, which I suspect was run by them) and then took B2B fees. 
Satoshi saw all these digital currencies go down in the 1990s and early 2000s hence decentralization.
