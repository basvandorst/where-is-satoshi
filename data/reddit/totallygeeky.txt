I checked out with Bitcoin just moments before I posted this. It's not listed yet, but if you go all the way to step 6 (Payment) it is there.

~~Sounds like a signed copy of the book to me, but I could be wrong! Perhaps confirm with him on twitter. I would myself, but my battery is dying and I'm on a plane!~~
I think I'm totally wrong. It adds $5 to the purchase of a book for the signature and charitable donation. Sorry for the confusion!

I'll shoot them back a message on my customer support ticket to remind them of it.

There's a difference between a scam and a poor company. They're not a scam, because they do deliver. It just takes a long time.

Just digital copies, as far as I can tell. 
@_date: 2014-01-19 06:12:35
How so? I've heard of everyone that's kept their order processing getting their units eventually. I know I got mine, and it's been delivering as promised.

Just because you don't make as much money as you thought you would doesn't make it a scam. And the pre-mining is all rumor.

Excellent! Thanks for chiming in, Andreas! Hopefully there will be no more confusion, only happy customers and happier non-profits!

Broad, damning claim made with no proof? I'm sorry, but I am suspicious of this at best.

From what I've seen of the checkout process (which could be wrong, notably), it looks like you pay through the site so he gets your details, and will specifically pass on the funds from the charity purchases to the charities. 
@_date: 2014-01-02 17:36:28
Yeah, I'm sure some people are. I've been pushed towards them though, due to to a few things. I've been having issues with my bank processing things in a reasonable time period, and I really like the idea of controlling my finances completely. 
I think that will be a good thing to push when talking to people about it, once you have bitcoins, they're yours. You protect them, don't go waving them around like a wad of cash, and you'll have them till you spend them, and nobody can tell you otherwise. 
@_date: 2014-01-27 20:11:22
Thanks man! Much appreciated!

Look, a lot of people are going to get angry at the mere mention of BFL. I bought from them a while ago, and it took a while, but I got my product, fully functioning. 
Keep looking into things you're interested in or curious about. People will bitch and bitch and bitch, so don't listen. Put it out there and hope it will help someone.

Switched to my phone, the in-air WiFi is surprisingly unrestricted. ~~Anyways, it looks as though get both the signature and the book by ordering through his site, and then it will be shipped to you upon release~~. See above comment. 
Note this is just from my understanding, and hopefully the site explains in greater detail.

Unless your keyboard is broken in half, then you can still hit the button to trigger the function of any missing or malfunctioning keys. And, you're not that poor if you can still afford internet and whatnot, especially since you can usually get a keyboard at salvation army for a dollar or two. 
Quit trying to play the pity card. 
@_date: 2014-01-19 07:59:14
Right, but there is no actual evidence to presented for that. And you knew, before even purchasing any product from them, that the difficulty would likely change before the product was received, and any delays would further decrease profit. 
@_date: 2014-01-19 06:41:25
Exactly, that's all just rumors from people so far.

Full disclosure: I am a part of the College Cryptocurrency Network, however we are a nonprofit, of course, and I do not recieve compensation from this. All money goes towards paying for things we need (mostly lawyers for contracts) and events around the globe, such as hackathons and conferences.
Also please note: "This item DOES NOT INCLUDE THE BOOK – it is an add-on for a book purchase." The charitable donation is for signature only, and does not include a book. 
And for the sake of posterity, the site, as should have been included: 
@_date: 2014-01-02 17:51:11
Yup, most of the people in my neck of the woods that accept Bitcoin are IT services. It is a broad brush, but it is a pretty fair picture of how it is right now. It'll just take a while to change that.

Please note that's to be added on top of a book pre-order! 
@_date: 2014-10-09 04:44:40
That's what the tweet was. I quoted it, and think regardless of caveats, it's a great way to support non-profits. I can see how one might find it misleading though, and added in relevant text to my disclosure comment!

I've heard mention of him writing up a follow up piece, with the statement and some other details. I can't give an ETA, but it's on his radar. If that piece is written, the original article will be edited to reflect that. 
To note, I'm an editor for the site. 
@_date: 2015-03-01 19:39:28
I think that's being a bit overly simplistic, don't you? There's a bit more nuance with the situation regarding community relations, possibly sketchy motives, and the court battles you see Bitcoin being dragged though on its way to more markets. 
@_date: 2015-03-02 18:39:21

There's only one listed on Coinmap, an IT guy, but I don't live in Anchorage (I'm up in Fairbanks) so I can't say if there are more. There's another IT guy up in Fairbanks that accepts it though, and I'm going to try and work with the University to start accepting it for some stuff, even if it is just donations or something. 
@_date: 2013-12-08 23:32:14
Why does that matter? 
@_date: 2013-12-11 20:30:34
Ah okay. Thanks. Was really unsure of what was being talked about there.
@_date: 2013-11-18 22:28:58
Why? I don't see anything that actually says that. 
@_date: 2013-11-23 23:24:50
Yeah, really, it does exactly what I need a Bitcoin Client to do, and it's been really stable.

@_date: 2013-12-10 20:51:36
Why bother asking how much people would donate in BTC if they already can though? If I was going to, I probably would have by now. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 23:18:19
The difficultly is a supposed to auto adjust according to an algorithm  to keep production of bitcoins on track. 
@_date: 2013-11-23 23:52:19
Very true. I can see the draw there. Maybe recommend both, but make note that QT can take a while to start? 
@_date: 2013-12-11 19:27:25
Possibly, but honestly I'm not sure if they want to compete or just be the first to really integrate it. Either way would be great for their bottom line.

@_date: 2013-12-07 15:16:15
Oh I fully understand that, I just simply wrote it using the terms everyone seems to be throwing around. I'll be focusing a lot on what you talk about in an upcoming editorial on the general state of our community and a few major flaws on how we handle things.
Added a few more lines in the article about what you talked about.

Bought every Humble Bundle and a few games from their store with BTC since they added it.

@_date: 2013-11-23 23:03:53
And what's wrong with QT?
@_date: 2013-12-08 23:43:25
You can't differentiate between loss and just people holding onto coin, so there wouldn't be an effective way of counteracting that. Furthermore, it would just drive a push to using smaller denominations of BTC as the default, as the lowering of supply would slowly drive price up. 
@_date: 2013-02-28 06:55:25
Good tip, I'll definitely keep it in mind. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 19:27:43
It certainly should, but unfortunately people are night terrible at recognizing such situations. 
@_date: 2013-12-11 17:53:39
No begging. 
@_date: 2013-12-06 22:05:12
Well that's kind of a no duh thing. Of course you see price changes as smaller if the units are smaller.
@_date: 2013-12-10 14:22:32
It takes them a while to ship. You should have been wary. But, I think you'll still recieve what you ordered.
@_date: 2013-12-11 19:41:31
Its not necessarily the price increase that will make them scarce, but time will. People will lose them, throw them away, forget passwords, etc. Those will be lost forever, and only 21 million will be made.

I'm sorry I think things you like are stupid and backwards.
@_date: 2013-12-17 22:31:48
Yeah, I agree. Ah well, I'll just continue to use Gyft for tons of other things, and wait for that to happen. In the mean time, I'll just ask the person at the counter if they might accept Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-12-11 18:49:52
Very true, and the one thing we will never be able to expect is how BTC and the community adapts to a changing economic climate, and that will be one of its deciding factors. 
@_date: 2013-11-25 12:11:55
I read through the paper (you should too, it's good stuff), and their research actually seems pretty solid. Definitely some interesting implications in this. 
@_date: 2013-12-11 19:07:21
I don't think you can say that's a fact. Your second paragraph is wrong, as other altcoins can simply have other features or a better network to operate on. Let's not even begin to get with to the fact that you're only looking at ones we have today, and that they're still even moreso early on in development than BTC, and that new ones could introduce something great any day. 
Your final point is against Bitcoin itself. Bitcoin is meant to foster competition, not dominate a market with a heavy hand. Altcoins are natural and will spring up, and will hopefully gain an independent image from Bitcoin soon. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 06:50:49
Well, I just wrote one addressing the issues in Gary North's (prominent economist) article saying that Bitcoin is a Ponzi Scheme. As far as just writing about those issues, I feel like writing material would run out fast. 
@_date: 2013-11-29 02:44:54
Sick! I emailed them a couple weeks ago about adding BTC to the store. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 15:34:07
They'd have to know where exactly you kept your BTC, and if you were properly secured, you'd have them on a flash drive or something, not locally stored on your PC. 
Robbers can easily take off with your life savings too if you never used banks. And the only reasons banks are safe is because they have other businesses constantly betting on whether or not they'll get robbed (insurance). 
@_date: 2013-12-07 04:17:35

Sure, and we could make one for every day of the year. Doesn't mean it's something that should happen, or most people can do. 
@_date: 2013-12-10 21:17:16
First of all, chill out. Did you talk to support or anything like that? Second, those are really big accusations to be throwing around without any (indicated) actions to contact the offending party. Be an adult, contact them.
I've worked with them a few times, and never had real problems. Took a bit to deposit initially, but after that they've been pretty speedy.
@_date: 2013-12-11 18:37:46
I understand that. What I'm saying is that people will eventually realize there are other cryptocurrencies that do an equal, if not better, job in some cases, and that sill severely cut down in the stock placed in Bitcoin, as it is currently seen as the only one by most of the public and casual users.
@_date: 2013-02-21 01:58:03
Well I would certainly keep it, and possibly do your last suggestion.
@_date: 2013-12-08 23:50:38
Doesn't make it any less of a sad fantasy, and if a female were to see it, I'm sure it'd scare her off from buying on localbitcoin at least. I know a few females at least who are in on Bitcoin now, my girlfriend included. Women aren't encouraged to either a.) be active in non-facebook sides of the web, or b.) are not wanting to reveal they're a women because they'll instantly bombarded by creeps and weirdos. For more women to be interested, there would need to be a more woman friendly community. 
@_date: 2013-12-10 21:24:27
This has been happening since the beginning of Coinbase, it's to avoid being involved with market tampering, so if there's a large increase or decrease in price, some transactions can be marked as high risk and cancelled.
@_date: 2013-12-01 17:10:26
I think your numbers are filled with bogus premises. If Bitcoin was that widely accepted, they wouldn't be nearly as volatile. So automatically, that changes things. Second, you use 2012 estimates of world product to try to get a value of all bitcoins ever, which won't be made until close to 2140. 
So, as far as I can see, your math = bogus. 
@_date: 2013-12-11 01:34:28
Mhm, people should get the point either way, and if they don't I believe BTC should come up in a google search for either.
@_date: 2013-12-11 18:46:22
I totally agree, I just think people will get super excited about the new heights bitcoin reaches, only for them to fall significantly when Altcoins become more widely accepted, or a "true competitor" (one that's seen as equal or better than Bitcoin itself) is found. 
@_date: 2013-11-26 19:20:00
As I'm writing about in an editorial of mine, I believe that stability is going to be reached, or at least more closely at hand, as its widespread usage as a currency grows. That will provide smaller transactions, at higher amounts, balancing out the value, while (hopefully) people playing the currency as a commodity, which are much of the cause of instability today.
@_date: 2013-12-10 19:02:12
No, because that again goes against what I wanted. I don't want it to be a person, because then sex and gender is involved. Leave it an "ambiguous" letter, or simple symbol, not a person. Leave personal wants and likenesses out of it. 
@_date: 2013-12-10 18:18:33
Their currencies are also called dollars though, so I think that's mostly the namer's faults. Or at least, they should have been more pushy about emphasizing the Canadaian part of the CAD$ then, or whichever dollar in particular is being talked about.

Fair point, and I think that's what stage we're in now, and will be for a while. I think Bitcoin will start to stabilize somewhat, and then fall in price a bit as other Alts begin to be more widely utilized, once their potential is seen.

Considering Bitcoin is hovering around 800 now, I'd say we're far from the ground. 
@_date: 2013-12-02 18:50:13
Yup, don't do it. Go through reputable exchanges or localbitcoins. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 17:29:40
a.) A price guidance would do what for who exactly? 
b.) I doubt you have the training to properly calculate such things, I know I don't. 
c.) I don't see the point in it because yes, it is very volatile right now, and people aren't rational actors. Predicting markets when they act like this is like trying to predict where in the yard your dog will shit. 
d.) I only mentioned that far down the line because you mentioned all the Bitcoins being mined, which as I said is more than 100 years off. If you want to talk about the current times, then use current numbers. 
@_date: 2013-11-23 08:53:46
And this has to do with what?...
@_date: 2013-03-08 23:48:03
It's not, but their work structure is somewhat Anarchistic in nature. There really isn't much of a formal supervisor-employee construct there, it's just employees working on whatever projects they please. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 15:38:50
First off, don't say "to be considered a real currency", because it seems like just about every country has a different opinion on what currency is nowadays.  
Second, fluctuation isn't an issue. I mean it is right now, but it'll be righted with time. It's not something we can control, as new players in the market forming and collapsing is something unavoidable. 
Your money under the bed analogy isn't quite the same as bitcoin, as the dollar has been around for at least 150+ years, while bitcoin has had 5, maybe. If we had that long, I'm sure we'd be pretty stable too. 
To echo the other commenter, don't invest what you can't lose. It's a high risk market for a reason. 
All value is just based on what people will pay for it. If people think a product is shit, then it will be worth the paper it's printed on, and the currency itself ain't worth shit. We have a high potential value too, as the ease of use and access of bitcoin tends to be something people are willing to pay quite a bit for.

Hi John, 
I'm writing an article on this, and am trying to figure out the real story in it. Could you explain in simple terms how your fees are supposed to work? Is it supposed to be 30% of the buyer's fees that are on top of BTC price?
@_date: 2013-12-01 17:18:29
Why would you make those assumptions? There are so many tiny, insignificant things that could throw off these estimations by thousands of magnitudes, and you're estimating something more than 100+ years off (since you were talking about almost all BTC being made already), that any realistic estimation simply can't be made. Anything else is a silly thought experiment, completely taken out of reality.

No, you don't get it. He's saying that when put on rings, jewelry, etc. Diamonds are not functionally different from cubic zirconium. So why do people want real diamond jewelry? Because they want the real thing, like he said. 
But if you have such a big problem with it, why don't you make your own coin? 
@_date: 2013-12-11 19:04:25
Very true. Same thing with early Bitcoin though. We'll just have to see what ones get support and how they're intergrated, and watch out for suspicious activity like that.

I doubt that. A lot of these coins take a different approach to cryptocurrency, and although they might add in some cool features, I doubt that someone will be able to just copy everything that makes the other coin unique into it. 
@_date: 2013-12-10 20:48:35
How does that change anything? You can give it to BitPay who will directly change it into Fiat for them. They get what they want, and you can donate as much as you want.

I put money into gettting a Jalapeno, but at this point I'm just disappointed. I was fine with the long time to ship, I was willing to risk the money, but it stings just a bit that for what they did do, they didn't even do it well (if the reports about the product failures are true). It's also frustrating that they would so blatantly ignore PR/Customer interactions, because with my jobs over the years and the projects I've done (not related to bitcoin at all, but that doesn't really matter) customers and patrons are the number one priority.

So, this is my new blog. I've got my first real post up, and I'm looking for feedback. A bit about me: I'm a student (as it says) and I'm hoping this might turn into a research project one day, but until then this is a good way to collect everything in one place, get feedback, and have it easily be shared. If anyone has any suggestions, comments, or suggestions I'd love to hear them.

I think about $150, if I recall correctly, Electricity cost is $0, I'm in a dorm, and it'll be profitable in a couple months, most likely. I don't particlarly care about that though. I made an initial investment, and now I am making bitcoins I can use to buy things. As far as I'm concerned, money well spent. 
@_date: 2013-12-02 16:49:26
Hey, read the rules. 


I get it, I grew up lower middle class too. I'm 12 grand in debt on my second year of college (which is actually pretty decent), and my parent's haven't been able to afford to help me out at all, minus some food money here and there. 
Do real scholarships, calling this a scholarship is prettied up begging. Find ways to help subsidize your college years through working for the university. Work during the year, etc. 
But this... You can fuck right off with this.

Cmon, you should know there are smaller denominations.

I wouldn't believe you if you have 3 PHD's on associated subjects. There is no floor, there is no max value, there is no "fair' value. The market will decide how low it goes, how high it goes, and what it settles on. Too many unknowns are left, and all estimates are stupid. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 11:20:45
Hey, quick heads up. This gets posted like EVERY WEEK. And every week, the graph magically seems like it might be following that pattern. Why? Because of what we call the sharpshooter's fallacy. You can find patterns in whatever, as long as you put the scale right.

That's a dollar sign though?

That's not all they do, you should actually look into Altcoins.

No begging/asking for donations. Read the rules. 
@_date: 2013-12-03 21:57:37
They simply don't want it as a donation source at this time. They've been asked many times. I don't think asking them again would do much.

No one knows. Anyone that tells you otherwise is a liar. They're just giving their unsupported guesses. We can't predict how the market will interact with a still growing user and knowledge base. For safety's sake, simply don't invest anything in Bitcoin that you wouldn't be fine with losing.
@_date: 2013-12-07 04:12:40
Then why make the post? 
@_date: 2013-12-11 18:53:20
Maybe so, (I think a few have potential), but you also can't account for future competitors or how they'll develop. Even though Bitcoin is in its early stages, these altcoins are in even earlier ones.

Any money you invest in Bitcoin you should be willing to lose, tomorrow. If its money you could really use right now, no. Use it. this investment is incredibly risky still.

Kind of a broad statement. I ordered back in March and it shipped a couple days ago. I mean, it took forever to ship, but there were no real problem.

No, you have a flaw in your knowledge of "Bitcoin 101".
Coins are mined at a constant, predictable rate, controlled by the mining difficulty. If many new machines are added to the mining network, the difficulty will increase a lot, if a bunch went offline for a long time, it might (although it never has) decrease. Bitcoins are mined in such a way that the last bitcoin (putting us at a total just below 21 million) will be mined in hopefully early 2140.

A.) Bitcoin won't "just stabilize" because its in the limelight, that's stupid to ask. It's a currency in its infancy, which will be volatile as hell for a while, especially with many countries still deciding on its status, and how it will be regulated. 
B.) Businesses can use it now, pretty risk free, with Bitpay and what not. There are services there to aid businesses, both in protecting them and aiding them in accepting BTC. 
C.) The % change, which is what we should care about, is much greater from $1 to $100, than what we went through today. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 18:04:00
If you need this number, then you ignored rule  of Bitcoin: Don't invest what you can't lose.

Thanks :) I appreciate the good vibes. Any critiques or is everything looking peachy on your end? 
@_date: 2013-12-08 23:48:09
People see it to be similar as one from the outside, and without a knowledge of how it works. They see one figure at the top with a decent amount of it, encouraging others to buy in to make money, who encourage others to join in to make money, ad infinitum... 
To look at it like that requires not understanding how the money works though.

Not sell on Google Wallet/Paypal? I don't know why you would think the other party wouldn't do a chargeback. There is little to no risk for them, and consumer protection almost always goes with them. Do local bitcoins or sell through exchanges.

So what do you have against alternatives then? Do you not like people having options to choose whichever system they prefer? Just because you don't have a use for a system, because you're comfortable with the one you're using, doesn't mean the system is valueless, just not your thing, so leave it be.

Wow what? That supports what I said. It tries to produce one every ten minutes, which would put on course to finish producing bitcoins at 2140.

I was just using the nomenclature everyone seems to be throwing around, becuase it was a pretty significant dent (45%-50%) of our worth. Anyways, I also referred to it as a price correction in the article, as honestly, that's what I'd prefer to call it. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 22:10:01
I would still say yes, because I believe we're going to hit another crash soon. This rapid deflation is just too much for the market to handle well.

He's not arguing bitcoin over real money, he was pointing out the fact that your argument is exactly that of the old bitcoin vs. real money argument. I already use this thing I value, so why would I value this new thing at all, and by extension, why should anyone else?

No, the argument is competition, which drives the free market. Anyways, there are other features, you're just ignoring them. As far as people having different coins, that's just like people having currencies from different countries, and I don't see the big issue with that, especially since this can all be streamlined online. 
@_date: 2013-12-11 18:12:30
I agree with you 100%. I think people fail to realize that yes, that climb from pennies to a thousand has been crazy, but climbing another 1000% or so is ***incredibly*** unlikely. There is a cap as to what some things can be reasonably worth before people find alternatives.
