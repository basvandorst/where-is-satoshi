I'm stuck on a Windows box unfortunately.  I did install Electrum and modified the config file, but no luck...

I just installed it (Android).  No luck.  It only works on the mainnet.

It's working using Counterwallet via the Web, but I was hoping for a mobile solution...

Thanks.  I'll look into that.

They do have kind of a sad, world weary look don't they.  Kind of like one of my co-workers who bought in January.

I didn't ask, but when I look at the paintings my guess is that he would prefer to sell - or maybe prefer to have sold a while ago...

I just found a gallery [web site]( selling his work.  The painter's name is Piotr Topolski.  It looks like the size is 18x24 cm.

So I was wandering around Krakow, taking a few days vacation before I head home from a Virtual Currency conference that I just attended in The Hague, and I saw these being sold by a street artist.

250 zloty.  About 70 US dollars.  They're roughly 8x11 inches.

Found it!

Does anyone have a link to the text of the patent?  Google is not my friend this morning...

How dare he assume that my gender options are only binary?  :-)
According to [Wikipedia]( "Anne Fausto-Sterling suggests a classification of 23 sexes and a move away from the socially constructed gender binary classification of male and female."

In Canada how it's recognized, at least from a tax perspective, depends on how you are using it.  If it's something that you buy and hold on to hoping it will go up in value, then it's treated as an investment.  If you purchase something with it, it's treated as barter.
It will be interesting to see how this interpretation evolves.
