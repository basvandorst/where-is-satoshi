You'll have to get that cash into the country somehow.  Anything electronic has a paper trail, unless you plan on flying that cash into the country in suitcases (good luck with that).

If you bought the BTC for 5k and sold for exactly what you bought it for, you shouldn't owe any taxes because you didn't realize any gains (or losses).  The alien would be on the hook for paying the taxes on the 15k gains.  Even if they're a non-resident alien, if they're living here, they still need to pay their taxes.

You don't understand bitcoin, obviously.  Bitcoin is money, just like USD.  Any purchase you make, you're required BY LAW to pay the appropriate taxes.  If you don't, and you're caught, you'll pay the price, whether you're paying with USD, bitcoin, gold sheckels, or cow manure.  Same goes for how your employer pays you.  Sure, if he pays you under the table with bitcoin and doesn't file a tax form on you at tax time, you won't have anything to worry about, really.  But if he pays you in bitcoin and reports you as a business expense (which he is surely going to do), you will show as owing tax.

The majority of bitcoin *is* mined by a small group of people. Probably 60-70% of all mined coins in any pool is being mined by major players in mining that have hundreds or thousands of ASIC miners, and some pools are owned and operated by the ASIC makers themselves, only mined with their hardware that they own.

Bitcoins are digital, therefore not protected by Paypal or Ebay.  The only, repeat, ONLY, way to sell Bitcoins on Ebay and not worry about chargebacks is to sell physical bitcoins, such as coins or paper bitcoins.  Unless it's tangible, i.e. you can actually hold it in your hands, Paypal will allow a chargeback and there is zero you can do about it.  
An example... I know someone who sells his books in ebook format.  He was using Paypal on his website to take payments for said ebooks.  Paypal allowed several chargebacks on him, even tho the ebooks were downloaded by the customers and he had records of this.

You've copy/pasted this exact reply in multiple responses in this thread.  It's tired.  No one, I repeat, NO ONE is saying 250MB block size.  But with 81 blocks worth of transactions consisting of 203k BTC stuck in mempool, it isn't sustainable, and something needs to be done.  SegWit will help, and needs to be implemented post-haste, but that won't be enough.  So take your horseshit "muh decentralization" argument and shove it up your ass.  I prefer something that works, that doesn't cost in transaction fees half of the amount I want to transact in the first place.

You are one of the lucky ones lately.  When BTC was around $15, getting money into BTC-e or Gox with Bitinstant was a very straightforward thing and it was always fast.  Nowadays it's extremely hit or miss, mostly misses.  I won't do anymore business with the company.
@_date: 2013-02-28 21:28:24
I placed my initial order of 5BTC with coinbase, no issues.  After receiving them, I placed another order for 10.  Before the date that they were to be released, I went ahead and placed a second order for 10.  The first order of 10 was cancelled on the day I was to receive them, same with the second order.  Coinbase was kind enough to go ahead and push these two orders thru, but I've already decided to not order from them again.  Waiting 3-4 days, only to have your order cancelled, is just too much.  I'll happily deal with bitinstant/BTC-e over Coinbase any day, and even pay a bit more.

Because it's wasted money. Cars depreciate extremely fast, the resale value will plummet quite quickly.  After a few years, maintenance on something like that (Lambo or Ferrari, I mean) becomes extremely expensive. 
 Leasing for a couple years has none of those risks, and all of the reward of being able to drive it as if it were yours.

Yep, I was had for 3 btc literally a day after they implemented the email verification.  I'm thinking BTC-e knew this was becoming a problem and that's why they implemented this security feature.   This is not a contained problem...this is widespread.  I know at least four other people that this very same thing happened to.  And of course BTC-e was absolutely zero help.  I no longer use them nor will I ever again.
