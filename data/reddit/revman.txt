Why not send it to a series of trusted escrow persons.
Then after say one year the trusted escrow persons would distribute the funds. So if the project was on track the coins could go to developers and other expenses. Otherwise it would be returned to the investors. At least then you'd have a hope in hell of ever seeing your money again.  The problem is to find escrow agents who are not associated with the project and who are also unlikely to collude with each other.  Proof of burn may be useful such as when an entire community wants to switch to a new currency.  For boot-strapping start-ups there are better solutions.

It was another negative piece hyping the non-charged murder-for-hire.  That's right DPR has **not** been indicted for murder-for-hire.  You would not know that from reading this piece.
@_date: 2014-12-05 01:53:49
I stand corrected.  I'll rephrase my concerns. This thread purports to refer to a 'not negative' report about DPR yet offers nothing from the defense side of the argument.  It needs to be noted that after about a year no bail has been granted and no arraignment (formal charges/trial date) have been filed on the murder-for-hire issue. 
quote from the 'free ross' site: "He was arraigned in New York on four counts, to which he pleaded not guilty: narcotics trafficking; computer hacking; money laundering; and engaging in a criminal enterprise."

I agree with your worldview in general.  You have it down to some finer detail than I have pondered.   I've seen a lot of this sentiment expressed here and on bitcointalk forum and like to think it's a big part of my affinity for the coin.  Claims were made around the year 2000 that the dot com boom was to be bigger than the industrial revolution but that never sounded right to me.   Now there's the ability to fix once and for all the monetary system and that does have the potential to be bigger and more important than even the industrial revolution.

CALGARY — A man is in custody after he crashed his pickup truck into the Calgary Courts Centre early Monday, police say.
The crashed occurred at about 3:30 a.m.
“An adult male decided to drive through the doors of the courthouse,” Insp. Guy Baker said.
“This individual is well known to police and his conduct is not surprising to us.”

I never denied having any privilege.  Care to expound?   Was there  only one ethnic group involved in debasing the dollar?   I took exception to singling out old and white since that's what mainstream media and history professors would have you believe.   Also I took some care not to make the comment a personal attack so was surprised by the tone of your response.   Anyone involved with Bitcoin in these early days should   be considered privileged regardless of age or color.

If you're running the old client don't you get a message in red that says "All users of Bitcoin-Qt/bitcoind versions 0.7.2 and earlier are required to upgrade to 0.8.1 or apply a manual workaround by May 15." ?

In mining you invest electricity and equipment, in pre-mining very little if any electricity or equipment is invested and only a select few individuals can 'invest'.  With Mastercoin thousands of bitcoins were invested and this investment was open to the public. It is not useful to compare this with a pre-mined coin.

Thanks for the scoop!
I noticed today that the bitcoin order button is in the sidebar
on the metart main page.   
Is it possible to add a couple details to the bitpay invoice?
It doesn't show the email address of the person ordering nor does
it have any reference to the affiliate ID. (the affiliate ID is visible in the html (view source) when you order from CCBill.  
It might be reassuring to the customer to see his email address on the same page as the bitcoin address for payment.  Likewise it's reassuring for affiliates to see their ID even if it's in a hidden field.
Just a suggestion.
   
@_date: 2013-02-12 07:43:13
I notice the site  is still not accepting bitcoin.  In fact the order page still has paypal as the payment method!!
It's fairly trivial with bitpay or whatever to set up bitcoin handling for online orders so what gives?

I agree it's annoying to be charged to withdraw bitcoins.  Typically you've paid substantial fees to exchange fiat for bitcoin and now they want more just to do a transfer.  Virwox does the same thing but they take 0.02 bitcoins every time.
