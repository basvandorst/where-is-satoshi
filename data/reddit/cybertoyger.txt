Wait, why would AnCaps say that co-op run utilities are bad? It's just another form of government-free tax-free utility being provided by the public sector; it's basically the same as everyone within a community creating a wireless mesh with all their routers. I would give my left nut to have a co-op run ISP here!

"However, the government could certainly screw with existing bitcoin owners by making it illegal for local businesses to accept them. That would drive the currency underground, kill its enormous potential, and substantially reduce its value."
You know, like they did with alcohol! And drugs! Glad neither of those were worth anything after the Government made them illegal! Sorry, 4 paragraphs in and the argument/plan's basis has already fallen apart. Here's what's more likely:
"However, the government could certainly screw with existing bitcoin owners by making it illegal for local businesses to accept them. That would drive the currency underground, make things riskier for government-defying businesses, and substantially increase its value".
Here's the reality: you can't protect Bitcoin from politics. You couldn't protect alcohol, you couldn't protect marijuana, you couldn't protect gold, you couldn't protect various bizarre forms of drawn pornography. All you can do is educate the masses and fight to legalize things after they've been erroneously banned/outlawed. This is the problem with mob rule, a.k.a. "democracy", this is the problem with Government, this is the problem with putting YOUR LIFE into the hands of politicians.
