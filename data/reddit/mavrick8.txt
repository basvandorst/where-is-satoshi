If you don’t need the money bro just relax and be patient. Don’t panic and sell if it gets lower. Ride the waves.  Halving is right around the corner.
@_date: 2019-10-16 23:23:11
No one knows the bottom. Buy a little every week. Buy half now half in a week. Buy it all now. You do you bro.

Keep it if you don’t need the money. Could be worth a lot more in a few months/years.

Word on the bitcoin streets says by end of the year 12-18k then the halving in April-May should have a steady rise to 250k. Then again who knows. Buy the discount and wait for it to play out. Think we will all be happy in a few months
@_date: 2019-09-06 23:21:51
