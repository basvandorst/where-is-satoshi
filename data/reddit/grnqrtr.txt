By what standard is anything that you just mentioned right or wrong?  
You seem to think it is wrong, but you don't have any justification to that claim.  You can't have absolute morality without God, only mere opinion.

It's looking like maybe there was never a prize.  I used " as the passphrase at passphrase.io and it used to result in this:










iF4EAREIAAYFAlK5pacACgkQuJVtv+58EFxiXgD/QGwQVCZMAlE7fL6V1Kbv4Ogq Sa9VTEw+s9mWwiBInp4A/3guc2PvZb8iIdrCyWGwIMJIOQS8OuhWfjtN3CBhOSA1 =S+B+ 


Send a message to me at with the above information and I will send 0.05 to the address above. You can sweep the funds afterwards.
The XXX's is the private key to the address in the signed message.  I've PM'd OP three times since I found the message, but have never gotten a response.  [It also looks like that address \(which I have the private key for\) still has had no transactions go through it.](  It seems that the address in OP was just to make it look like there was a prize?  Or am I missing something, did anyone here get the prize?
@_date: 2016-08-06 02:48:08
OP, is it still possible to solve this from the beginning or did the answer to the first part of the puzzle get erased.  I suppose could probably answer too.
@_date: 2016-08-12 14:58:29


Again, why?  Why not say that "suffering" = good, and "no suffering" = bad?  It is mere opinion, why go with one over the other?


If it is written by the God who is the standard of morality, then yes, I will take that over random people's opinions.

@_date: 2016-08-12 21:00:35






Based on what you just said, there can be no absolute morality, only a subjective opinion of what is right or wrong.
Why not rape as many women as possible? It seems that that would be the best way for a strong male to pass on their genes? 


You seem to be concerned about what the Bible says, but you have no absolute standard to base your concerns on. 


Who's morals are you going with? The rapist's? Hitler's? 




Proof presupposes truth (You can't prove something that is false.), and truth presupposes God (You can't have absolute truth without God.)

I used to use Armory a long time ago.  I remember exporting my private keys once, and it took me a while to figure out how to export them as well.  It was kind of a hidden/weird way of getting to where you can export them.  I don't remember exactly, but I was able to eventually get them out if that makes you feel any better.
@_date: 2016-08-05 01:35:40
You can export your private key and then sweep it into Electrum. No need to wait for the blockchain to sync. [Here's a tutorial.](

The [cryptosteel]( seems like a good way to keep a seed safe for a long time.  I would go with what seems to be the "most" standard.  The path that Trezor/Mycelium use.  You can download and save this [BIP39 tool]( to restore all your key-pairs at a later day.

Is it possible to check the balance on your prepaid card?  I seriously doubt that he is trying to scam you with his highly positive rating.  He literally has 0 negative rating and +1924.  I don't know anything about paxful, or normal prepaid vs vanilla cards, but maybe there is a legit reason he doesn't want to do the trade.  If you can check the balance and he didn't take the cards, I would just trade with someone else.
I was in a similar situation before trading Amazon gift cards with someone on After giving someone all of my card codes, they told me they didn't want to trade because Amazon customer service said they had already been redeemed.  Anyways, he had a lot of positive feedback, he didn't claim my codes, I just ended up trading them with someone else.  I hope it's the same case for you.
@_date: 2016-08-30 06:16:21
You said in OP that this person has sent you bitcoin to this address in the past, but the address has exactly two transactions, one coming in and one going out.  The first time that address has ever received bitcoins was a few days ago.
Are you sure that you sent him that address?  Can you find your message where you sent it?

@_date: 2016-08-29 04:25:42
Does your "key" start with a 6?  If so it is probably a BIP38 encrypted private key.  Go to [ click "Wallet Details," input the private key that starts with a 6, click "View Details."  It will then ask you for a password to decrypt the private key.  Once you do that you will get the plain private key which can be swept into another wallet.  To be extra safe, you can download the bitaddress.org tool and run it completely offline on a clean computer so that no malware can steal your private key.  I hope you do indeed have a BIP38 private key and that you get your money back!
@_date: 2016-08-12 15:26:27


So is morality based on popular opinion?  Again, it's just opinion.  Who cares about "furthering the human species," some people think that the human race is a plague to this earth, let the trees and plants prosper!  Rapists think raping is good!  Hitler thought that getting rid of the "nasty" Jews would better society!  How can you say who's opinion of morality is the right one?
I can say absolutely that humans are more important than plants, that rape is wrong, that Jews are just as valuable as any other people.  I can say this because I have an absolute standard.


Unless you start with God, you can't make sense of anything.  It's either God or absurdity.

You essentially try to guess a phrase that someone might use to store bitcoins. The phrase "how much wood could a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood" at one point had up to 500 BTC pass through it. If you SHA256 the phrase you get the private key in Hex.

Here is a [python script]( we were using a while back to figure out combinations of a private key for a puzzle.  Maybe you could modify it for your situation?

It depends on how much you trust your computer and how much your willing to risk.

I'm pretty sure. I think all those brainwallet sites just pass the phrase through sha256 and use that as the private key in hex. You can just try and see if you get the private key that you are expecting.

I'm a little confused by your wording but all of the major hardware wallets (Ledger, Trezor, Keepkey, etc) allow you to create multiple accounts and within each of those accounts you can generate an endless number of key pairs. The accounts and key pairs are derived from a seed phrase.
@_date: 2017-02-24 14:58:00
I'm not sure what that error is, but I wouldn't panic yet. Do you still have the seed? Have you tried checking the connectivity (green dot bottom right corrner), maybe switch to a different server? Or try restoring from seed? (Make sure you save wallet file just in case.)

I'm not sure what desktop wallets are compatible, I only ever use Electrum, which isn't compatible.

I guess I was just thinking that since they limit it so much, they won't get economically overwhelmed by accepting a small amount of low fee transactions. If they only mined blocks full of low fee transactions, then it wouldn't be sustainable.

You should be able to export your private keys with [this tool]( If you use this tool, you should download it and use it on an offline clean computer (like a linux live session) because it will expose your private keys.

Were you ever able to get access to your bitcoin?
@_date: 2016-01-27 01:06:25
Blockchain.info gives you a seed phrase (I think 12 words) when you first sign up, that you are supposed to write down. You should be able to access your wallet with that phrase if you have it.
@_date: 2017-03-21 12:25:45

I've sold bitcrystals for bitcoin several times. At shapeshift.io, you choose the coin/token you want to sell in the left box (in your case SJCX), then in the right box you select BTC. Where it says "your payment address" you provide a regular bitcoin address that you want to receive the bitcoin to.
In the left box on shapeshift.io, where it says "Return Address (optional)" you can put in your counterparty enabled address so that your funds will get returned to you in case the transaction doesn't go through. You shouldn't be losing anything. 


 Like I said above, you are supposed to provide a bitcoin receiving address that you control. Hopefully you aren't using shapeshit.io (notice **shit**, not **shift**) which is a scam site. 


You should only send counterparty assets to a Counterparty enabled wallet, not to any regular bitcoin address. They will only show up in a Counterparty wallet.
From your Counterparty wallet, select the SJCX token, select "send," then put in the Counterparty enabled address that shapeshift.io gives you during the transaction window.

I'm not sure on the setup you described, but why not just use Electrum which comes with tails? You could still make a "watch only" wallet for an online computer. There's really no need to download the whole blockchain if you're not running a node.

Like you said BIP39 is a standard and is used by many of the popular wallets. There is a lot of BIP39 open sourced wallets and tools available on places like github as well, so any one can download the code and save it for later. This is a tool I use occasionally that is open sourced on github.
You could download it and save it to a flash drive or back it up in cloud storage to use years later. You can put your seed phrase into it and export all of your private keys if you ever need to. (Obviously do this offline and on a clean computer if you ever do.)
Because stuff like this is open sourced, it's likely there will always be a copy somewhere out there even many years later.

Were you ever able to figure this out?
@_date: 2017-03-14 14:52:41
It really depends on the size of the transaction (how many inputs were included) to be able to tell how much of a fee should have been included. You can use  to check on the current state of fees and see how long it is estimated to confirm. Right now it says:


For the median transaction size of **226 bytes**, this results in a fee of **49,720** satoshis.
If you go by the median transaction size, it seems like you should have used about 10x the transaction fee. (Though I don't know the exact size of your transaction.)
If part of the outputs were going to a "change" address within your own wallet, electrum lets you spend unconfirmed outputs. You can choose that output (ctrl+c will pop up a new tab called "coins") and send it back to yourself with a higher fee. It will encourage a miner to pick up both transactions and confirm them together in one block.
@_date: 2016-06-15 06:58:43
You should read the sidebar. 


@_date: 2016-06-06 12:31:10
All I'm saying is, I doubt they closed your account for "buying too much." $110 is only like 1/5 of a bitcoin right now.

You can export the private key for the address that your bitcoin is in, even without the blockchain being synced. You have to use the console, I believe the command is something like dumpprivkey, but you should Google it. You can then import the private key into another wallet.

@_date: 2017-01-24 07:59:00




For the median transaction size of 226 bytes, this results in a fee of 24,860 satoshis. 
According to  it looks like you would have needed to pay a fee of 110 satoshis/byte to get your transaction in quickly. You paid a fee of around 65 satoshis/byte.
It looks like bitcoinfees.21.co estimates your transaction going through within 4-26 blocks or 20-360 minutes.
What wallet did you use to send this transaction?

You can use a Trezor with multiple wallets, so you don't have to worry about Trezor's wallet going down. I use it with Mycelium on my phone and with Electrum on my computer.
You can recover from the seed on multiple wallets and different hardware wallets. I have my same seed loaded into my Trezor and Ledger Nano S. If you really need to you could even load your seed into a [BIP39 tool like]( this, and be able to export all of your private keys.
Many wallet seeds are compatible, but I actually think breadwallet is one of the few that use a different path. (I could be wrong about this.)

My name is [your name] and I'm a member of [church name]. I wanted to ask you about, and encourage you to look into accepting Bitcoin as a way for members to give a tithe or offering. I would love to make my weekly contributions through Bitcoin if the option was available.
If you are unfamiliar with Bitcoin and how it works, it is a digital currency that can be easily transferred through the Internet without needing to go through a bank. As of right now, one Bitcoin is worth about $800.
There are many ways to set this up, but the easiest way would probably be to go through a company like Bitpay.com. The church could set up an account with Bitpay and then post the church's Bitcoin address on the church's website or in the bulletin. You could even setup your Bitpay account so that when someone donates Bitcoin, it would be instantly converted to USD and deposited into the church's bank account seamlessly.
I would encourage you to take a look at  which gives an explanation of their service and the benefits of accepting Bitcoin.
Thank you for your time and consideration. I think this would be a very beneficial step for the church. Bitcoin is a new technology but is becoming more and more popular. Please feel free to ask me any questions if you have any!

It's definitely worth a shot, but I don't know that this will make it any faster. Your transaction will only get "accelerated" by ViaBTC choosing to put your low transaction fee into the next block that they mine, but they have only mined 1 out of the last 46 blocks. According to  your transaction should confirm in 4-26 blocks anyways.

Is it maybe a compressed address versus an uncompressed address? Did you try to put your private key into the "wallet details" section of bitaddress.org? (You should download bitaddress.org and use offline.) If you put the compressed private key it will give you the uncompressed one, or vice-versa.

I would export your private keys and sweep them into a better wallet (like Electrum). First download and setup a wallet in Electrum, making sure to write down and save your seed phrase.
Here's how to export private keys from Multibit and sweep in Electrum:
Open your Multibit wallet and go to "Tools" on the menu bar, then "Export Private Keys," it will bring up the export options. Choose the file location by choosing the "export to ..." button, or just leave it at the default and take note of the location. You can also choose "Do not password protect export file" since you are just going to copy and paste them into Electrum in a minute.
Now go to the location that you took note of before and open up that newly created "multibit.key" file with a text editor. There should be a list of private keys. You'll copy and paste from here in a minute.
Next open up Electrum again and go to "Wallet" --&gt; "Private Keys" --&gt; "Sweep." This will bring up a text box that you will paste your private keys into. Now copy and paste the private keys from the multibit.key file, you'll have to only copy the private keys without the dates and other information in that file.
You should be able to click the "Sweep" button now, and then it will create a transaction and you can broadcast it if there are any bitcoin associated with those private keys.
You can sweep the same private keys into Electron Cash which is based on Electrum, to get access to your Bitcoin Cash as well. 
Let me know if you need more help, I've helped several people recover coins before.

I've only every used Jaxx on android and even their latest release is very buggy. If I were you I would restore the seed phrase into a different wallet.
I don't use Mac/iOS, so I'm not exactly sure what wallet would be best for you to restore to, but I believe Jaxx uses the BIP39/44 standards for their seed.
You could probably use this [BIP39 tool]( to export and sweep your private keys if you need to. If you do use this tool, download the page and use it on an offline clean computer because it will expose your private keys.

In your picture it says "Synchronizing with network" on the bottom. You have to wait until that is done before your balance will show correctly. It can take a couple weeks to download and synchronize the whole blockchain depending on your hardware/internet.

I really like both the Trezor and the Ledger Nano S, for different reasons. They are very similar devices, though the Ledger Nano S is quite a bit cheaper.
One thing I like about the Trezor over the Ledger Nano S, is the password manager. I keep all of my passwords in it. One thing I like about the Ledger Nano S over the Trezor, is that you can seed the device without typing your seed into a computer (you can do it entirely on the device). It also has an Ethereum wallet that can be used from the same seed.

I'm not sure if any of the hardware wallets will show you the balance on a screen (maybe the new Ledger Blue?), but most hardware wallets you still use in conjunction with a software wallet.
I have a Trezor and a Ledger Nano S. They both are great hardware wallets. I primarily use them with Mycelium on my phone. So I can open up Mycelium on my phone (without connecting one of my hardware wallets) and see my full balance and all my transactions. I just need to connect a hardware wallet to my phone if I want to spend from one of the wallets.
I highly recommend the hardware wallet route. I went without one for a long time, but after getting the Trezor I can't believe it took me so long to get one! They are so simple to use and it's nice to know your bitcoin are safe!

The real issue is that if your device has ever connected to the Internet there is the chance that it has been infected with malware or a keylogger that could steal your pin/password and/or private keys. "Cold Storage" means the device/private keys have never been exposed to the Internet.
You should get a hardware wallet. I have both a Trezor and a Ledger Nano S. Both work great.

There's really no reason to leave any amount there if you are just storing it. If you are constantly trading, it would make sense to leave some there, but if you are just storing it keep it in addresses that you control the private keys to.

I know this isn't exactly what you are looking for, but I highly recommend going the hardware wallet route, especially if I was responsible for other people's bitcoins.
You said you didn't want to "mash them together" but you can have multiple accounts on one hardware wallet seed. You could also use multiple seeds, and just re-seed the hardware wallet depending on which one you wanted to use. You could even get several Ledger HW.1s, which are like $15 each.
I ran Armory offline a long time ago on a Raspberry Pi, but since using hardware wallets I'll never go back. My first was a Ledger Nano, then Trezor, and now I also have a Ledger Nano S. 
With a hardware wallet:
* Your keys are offline
* Write the seed down for a paper backup 
* Use with any operating system 
* Can have Multiple wallets
@_date: 2016-12-07 17:15:53
This looks really fishy. Why are there 15+ "users" that are asking you questions with less than 1 month old accounts. I lost count of how many I saw. Looks like you are asking yourself questions with sock puppet accounts.
@_date: 2016-12-28 02:06:47
There's no way to make it sync faster, you just have to wait. You can export your private keys from Bitcoin QT though, and sweep them into a lite wallet that doesn't need the full blockchain. [Here's a guide to export and sweep into Electrum. ](

I don't get how the password protection works with "varietyjones".  I have been trying to guess different seeds, and thought I was supposed to be using "varietyjones" to encrypt the wallet (which I thought would give me different addresses), but I get the same address output whether or not I use the password or leave it blank.  It seems like maybe I haven't been doing it right this whole time?

The last round all had passwords too. I asked the same question earlier but never got a response. It seems that you don't need it.   I'm not sure why he put it there.
Edit:  I believe in his tutorial video he puts in the password after recovering the seed, but all that would do is encrypt the wallet.
@_date: 2015-08-03 20:12:31
This is probably what you want to do. I've only ever used Armory offline and I've either just swept the private keys like or set up a raw transaction and broadcast it myself. You could also use [ (offline of course) to get the private keys. You just stick in your seed and it will output the private keys for you to sweep.

I thought of doing the same thing. I started working on design, but never finished it.
@_date: 2015-08-03 21:11:02
If you just "import" your Armory private keys into Electrum, then the Electrum wallet seed won't be able to recover those addresses (because they weren't created from the Electrum seed). What you'll want to do is "sweep" instead of "import." This will take the entire balance of the address you are sweeping and move it to one of your addresses that was generated by the Electrum seed. That way if something happens you can still recover the funds.

I know blockchain.info's wallet let's you manually set a fee, but most wallet apps at least let choose from a few options. I'm using Bitcoin Wallet too. If you click the three dot menu, where you can input the amount you want to send and sending address, it gives you three options: "economic," "normal," and "priority." I would use "priority" especially with the spam attacks going on.

I'm trying to acquire a little bit at a time, but I end up spending it, and slowly deplete my stash. I think it's good as both an asset and a currency. It's still a young currency and not widely used enough, so it makes a potentially good asset for now.
@_date: 2017-04-08 13:41:52
Just to tag onto this (and a slight correction), you don't actually always spend the entire balance of an address, but you spend from "Unspent Transaction Outputs" (UTXO). You could have multiple unspent outputs in a single bitcoin address.
It's like if you buy a $5 item with a $20 bill. You give the whole $20 over, but get $15 back.
In the case of OP, you paid with a 1.99983142 UTXO, sent 0.1 BTC to an address and got back 1.89980863 BTC to yourself.

What is the address you sent the bitcoins to?
Did you try to find your transaction using different block explorers? My thought was if you could find it, you could rebroadcast it and hope it eventually gets mined. I'm guessing you didn't use a high enough fee when you sent it the first time.
@_date: 2017-04-15 13:03:00
I'm talking about rebroadcasting the same transaction he already sent (the one that is already signed by his private key). If it included a low fee it would get dropped from the network after a few days but if it's still in someone's mempool somewhere I think it could be rebroadcast.
@_date: 2017-04-06 16:21:37
Okay, that makes sense.
@_date: 2016-02-12 13:54:28
Hmm... Did you enter the verification url that hosts your bitcoin address?
@_date: 2016-02-12 13:16:47
I think you can still link a bitcoin address to your node in case someone wants to send you a tip, they just aren't running the incentive program anymore . I linked one to my node just a couple days ago.

I used the guide at [raspnode.com/diy.html]( to build a Bitcoin XT node. I stored the blockchain on a 128GB usb flash drive.
I did run into some problems trying to get the blockchain synced up on the Pi2. It downloaded the first 50-60% just fine, but then it kept crashing every few minutes. I eventually set up a node temporarily on my laptop, plugged my usb flash drive into it, and finished syncing the blockchain from there. Now that the blockchain is fully synced it runs well on my Pi2. 
If you run into any problems on the way I'd be happy to try and help.
Edit: They also have instructions on raspnode.com to set up a Core node.
@_date: 2015-07-28 14:00:38
I would, but I don't even know how to get a UnionPay account.
@_date: 2017-04-15 16:01:59
Yeah, that's what I was thinking. If it wasn't sent to an exchange, he could even use CPFP to get it to confirm faster, but he likely doesn't control the private key to the address he sent it to.
@_date: 2017-04-14 00:44:46
If you restore from the seed phrase and your whole balance is there, ~~then, yes, you don't need any old wallet files~~ **(Read my edit below)**. The seed phrase is what you need to save and protect as your backup. All the key pairs are derived from those words, so you don't need anything else.
After doing some more reading, it looks like Multibit HD and Breadwallet seeds are compatible with one another, but they both aren't compatible with a lot of other wallets.
Most wallets use the standards of BIP39 (mnemonic phrase seed generation), BIP32 (Hierarchical Deterministic wallets), and BIP44 (hierarchy path.) I believe Multibit HD and Breadwallet follow BIP39/32 but not BIP44 which is why you weren't able to see your balance when you used your words in Electrum.
I've never used Multibit HD, but many wallets allow you to record transaction notes and address labels. If you have this information and want to keep it, you will need your wallet files because that information won't be tied to your seed phrase.
@_date: 2017-04-13 01:34:49
Something else must be wrong. Your transactions and balance should be associated with those seed words.
Edit: 
I'm not sure exactly what your problem is, but I just came across this issue from a couple years ago while searchng: 
It says the issue was closed, so I would think it should be fixed. But maybe you have an older version of Multibit? It used to not derive the key pairs from the seed correctly.
@_date: 2017-04-25 03:55:15
I understand. I'm the exact opposite though, I would be worried about the wallet file becoming corrupt or accidentally deleting it. I love having a physical backup I can hold.

Yeah, mine finally connected again and I got them sent to "Bitcoin Wallet." I've heard lots of good things about mycelium, so I thought I'd give it a try. Only had it a couple days and that seems like a pretty big issue.
@_date: 2017-04-13 01:04:33
After clicking "I already have a seed" there is a box to input the seed, but just under that there is a button labeled "options." Click that button and check "BIP39 seed" and see if you can click the next button.
Electrum doesn't use BIP39 normally like most other wallets.

@_date: 2017-04-14 02:01:42
The "bitcoin network" is a bunch of people running nodes. Surely you still have to connect to someone's node/server with breadwallet right?
@_date: 2015-07-15 06:03:51
I'm having the same problem. It connected a few minutes ago, but I'm getting "no server connection" again now. Next time it connects I'm just going to send my bitcoin out and stop using mycelium. I'm not sure if you can import the seed somewhere else or not.

This is not proof. It's speculation.
@_date: 2017-04-25 03:00:14
I used to use the wallet in OP, but eventually switched to Mycelium. It does have a lot of advanced features (which I like) but you don't have to use them all.
One thing I think is way better is the backup of the wallet. In the schildbach wallet you have to backup a file, in Mycelium it follows the BIP32/39/44 standards so all you have to do is write down 12 words on a piece of paper (or punch it into a piece of metal.) There are many wallets/tools that follow the same standard that are compatible with the seed. 
I also mainly use a Trezor or Ledger hardware wallet, which both can be used with Mycelium if I plug them into my phone with an OTG cable.

Yeah, the blockchain keeps growing all the time. It's 60GB+ right now. I think my 128 GB flash drive won't last for more than a year. But I can always eventually copy the blockchain to a larger external hard drive (say 10 TB) and run it on my Pi for another 10 years.

You can use this [BIP39 tool]( to check your seed. After selecting number of words and putting in your seed, you will see list of derived keypairs at the bottom. You can even download it and run it on an offline clean computer.  I recommend running it on a linux live session.
@_date: 2016-09-06 13:30:41
I've been using Trezor password manager.  You have to use a Trezor bitcoin hardware wallet to unlock your keys.  Each password is encrypted with a different key-pair so that even if one gets compromised all the rest of your passwords are still protected.
@_date: 2016-09-06 16:14:35
Yeah, you should. I made a random multisig with three xpubs then tried to make a transaction. It tells you the keys you need to sign with. I didn't finish the process because I was messing with an empty address, but I think it might work for you. 
I'm going to bed. I hope you figure it out.
Edit: I meant to say I put in three public keys, not xpubs, but you should be able to get public keys from xpubs
@_date: 2016-09-17 15:52:06
Look at the times buddy, you posted after me.

I don't know about you but I don't consider $100 low cost.  You're right that buying used probably wouldn't be good for a typical non-technical person, but I would definitely consider it.  I think it would be fun to verify firmware myself :)
@_date: 2016-09-06 01:45:40
Maybe bip32.org? I haven't messed with this tool much, but it looks like it will give you an xpub
Edit: Or maybe just go to the BIP32 tab after putting in your seed on the BIP39 tool. I see a box call "BIP32 Extended Key (addresses only)".
@_date: 2017-04-04 00:20:25
Hive wallet should have asked you to write down a 12 word seed phrase. That's the backup to your wallet. If you don't have that, you are out of luck. It doesn't matter if you have receipts or know what address you sent the bitcoins to. You need the private keys, which you get from that seed phrase. Are you sure you don't have that phrase?

Why not just take the check and buy bitcoin with it? That's what your client is going to have to do. Seems like it would make better business sense for you to do that than to get your client who doesn't know anything about it to do it.
@_date: 2016-09-06 15:11:16
You could send me one of the seeds, I load it into my Trezor.  You could then submit the payment proposal.  I could go first, and then you could sign with the second key?  Would that work?
Edit: This would only be good if you don't have any other bitcoin in the Trezor seed.
@_date: 2016-09-06 02:44:22
I put in your bitcoin address (HEX) and that time (1472817600) into coin.bin and I get this address - 3HRxtwVT21RdrQEVTxUCFA4CH3n99y9rVG
I'm not sure if this is part of the problem or not, but shouldn't I have gotten the same address that you did?
Edit: It looks like this address 3FzJeGQyk25kpwj3pRgYfm9iMZYjRmdrap has an unlock time of 1455019200 (Unix time), and this address 3HRxtwVT21RdrQEVTxUCFA4CH3n99y9rVG has an unlock time of 1454943600 (Unix time).  So both should be unlockable with the private key corresponding to this address 1NL4SMsqRR4yE1e9nb2Ai6N5bvSrU6KbrX.
Edit2: I'm really confused, I just realized that I have two different unlock times for the 3HRxtwVT21RdrQEVTxUCFA4CH3n99y9rVG address.
@_date: 2016-09-06 16:02:58
I was testing creating them on coinb.in, I think you should try recreating it there. If you put the redeem script in the "new transaction" tab, it sets it up so that you can make and sign a transaction.

I'm pretty sure you can verify the firmware yourself on most hardware wallets, that's why it's safe to buy from third party sellers and you don't have to worry about it being tampered with while it's in transit. I would think buying used would be completey safe.
@_date: 2016-09-07 04:58:24

Okay, I'm kind of understanding what the problem is ... I'll keep thinking.
@_date: 2016-09-15 13:18:53
Yeah, it costs quite a bit more than an HW.1, but it has a screen and can run apps, AND it's still quite a bit cheaper than a Trezor.  One thing I really like about it is that you can restore your seed to it completely on the device, no need to enter your seed on a potentially infected computer.
@_date: 2016-09-12 08:47:41
I might be wrong, but I think you can get in trouble for operating as a  "money transmitter" without having a license or something like that.
@_date: 2016-09-06 06:47:35
You can get old versions of Electrum here if that helps.
@_date: 2016-09-18 06:47:59
I think you can get in trouble for operating as a "money transmitter" without a license. You probably have to sell so much to be considered a "money transmitter" though. It probably depends on local laws.
@_date: 2016-09-06 04:09:40
That is odd.  It should at least be propagating even if it doesn't get mined into a block right away.
@_date: 2016-09-06 09:17:33
When you first set them up, they give you a 24 word seed that you write down and can use to recover your bitcoin. They both use the BIP39 standard (unlike electrum) so you can restore the seed into another device or many other wallets. I currently have the same seed loaded into my Trezor and Nano S.
Edit: You also can always use a tool like this [BIP39 tool]( to export your private keys. You can download and save this tool to use offline.
@_date: 2016-09-06 13:32:11
I've traded AGC for Bitcoin on before.  You definitely won't get a 1:1 rate though.
@_date: 2016-09-06 07:36:31
The reason why this is risky is because it exposes the private key, but unless you are able to send a transaction out, this is what you will have to do.  The way to do this safely is to do it on an offline clean computer.  You could do it in tails, or create a different linux live usb stick that has electrum.  You just don't want the private key to get stolen by malware/viruses.
@_date: 2016-09-06 01:14:52
I'm not sure what key pairs are used from a seed to create a multisig address, but this [BIP39 tool]( will export all private keys for a particular seed. You can download it and run it offline to be safe. Maybe you can use the exposed private keys to unlock your multisig wallet.
@_date: 2016-09-06 15:29:48
Would any of the tools at coinb.in be helpful?  I know you can create multisig wallets and create raw transactions.  [This one for example creates a multisig wallet.](
Maybe you could use it to try to recreate the same multisig address that your coins are stuck in?  I'm not sure, just a thought.
Edit:  Yeah, I think you should try sticking your three xpubs in [this coinb.in tool]( and then use the "redeem script" that it outputs in the [New Transaction tab](

It seems that the full reward would always be more valuable than the slight increase of value to the rest of their holdings. 
Anybody could burn a portion of their bitcoins right now to "increase the value of their other bitcoin" but it just doesn't make sense. You would lose a lot more value than you make.

I could give it a try if you would like some help. I've helped a number of people recover bitcoin. You can see references at [
@_date: 2016-09-15 12:12:47
I've never used the HW.1 but I have the Nano and used it for quite a while.  My understanding is that they are exactly the same except the Nano has a better build (instead of folding and clipping plastic).  I highly recommend it for a first hardware wallet.  It worked great for me.  I eventually upgraded to a Trezor so that I could have a screen on the device and wouldn't have to use the security card that goes with the Nano/HW.1.  I have since also gotten the Ledger Nano S which I am really liking.
@_date: 2016-09-06 10:10:17
You could also get a cryptosteel ( on top of a hardware wallet, to backup your seed.  You wouldn't have to worry about your paper backup getting water or fire damaged.  It's another $50 but it sounds like you might have recovered a good amount of money today :)
@_date: 2017-09-04 21:54:47

@_date: 2016-09-06 03:39:12
I think is probably right.  The transaction looks fine, but maybe 0.0001 was just to low of a fee for the network right now.  If you want it to go faster you could try broadcasting a new transaction with a higher fee.
@_date: 2017-09-21 07:57:54
First of all, I am sorry to hear about your lose. I pray that you and your family are able to heal/recover as much as is possible in this situation.
I'm not sure what "Bitcoin Peer" would mean, but it is possible that your brother accidentally wrote down the seed incorrectly (or maybe even on purpose for security.) You could try using some open source software called [btcrecover]( which will try to brute force the correct seed but you would need a known receiving address to the wallet in order to do this.
Several people have already said this, but be very careful with getting help from anyone. Taking this into account, I  am still offering to help you more if you would like. I have helped several people and have several references on my website ( for credibility, but again that should be a last resort option. Basically, if you come to the point where you are giving up on the bitcoin and counting it as a loss anyways, I would be happy to try to help.

@_date: 2017-09-21 08:19:58
I'm not exactly sure what the problem is. It is definitely possible that the wallet.dat is corrupted or encrypted. Did you use a password with the wallet back in 2014? If so, do you have any idea what it could be? You can use open source software called [btcrecover]( to try to brute force a password if you have a pretty good guess at what it was.
If you try everything that everyone else mentioned and still no luck, I might be able to help more. I have helped many people recover bitcoin from different wallets/issues and have several references on my website as well as all of my contact info. Let me know if you would like more help, best of luck to you! 
@_date: 2016-09-17 12:23:09
Not just you, I second this.  I think the wallet looks really slick/good, but it was really slow for me.  I didn't use it long because I couldn't stand how slow it was.
@_date: 2016-09-06 08:12:44
Glad you got your money!  You should get a hardware wallet to keep your bitcoin safe.  I recommend a Trezor ( or a Ledger Nano S (  Both of them will keep your private keys safe, and allow you to spend your bitcoin easily and securely even on a malware infected computer.
Edit: I own both of these wallets.  I've used a Trezor a lot more, but recently got the new Ledger Nano S as well.  Both of these companies are highly reputable in the bitcoin community.

As for regulations I think it just depends where physically in the world you are gambling from. There's actually quite a few bitcoin gambling sites. I've played pachinko, poker, and a  number of dice games all for bitcoin. I think bitcoin is going to be huge for gambling sites. It's quick to deposit and quick and easy to withdrawal your winnings. And all the legit sites are "provably fair." I'm not exactly sure all technically how it works, but you can see the seed which generates the random outcome and compare to your own seed (or something like that) and can see for yourself that is fair.

I'm probably completely wrong based on everyone else's comments, but I thought you couldn't actually include "data" in a block/transaction (in the sense of a full movie, ebook, image, etc.) but that you could only hash a file (movie, ebook, image, etc.) and include that hash or reference to the file on the blockchain.

Regardless of that, your argument is a fallacy. You are essentially saying "you're not a real user, because I don't consider you a real user." Of course they aren't "real users" if you are the one that gets to decide and define what a "real user" is.

Why is the "last winners" address the same as the deposit address? And it seems like it should say "send exactly 0.001" instead of saying that 0.001 is the "minimum amount," because that makes it sound like you can send more (which you can) but it doesn't affect the game any differently.

I've never used Hive wallet, but you should be able to use this [BIP39 tool]( to export your private keys that contain bitcoin by inputting your seed phrase. You should do this on an offline clean computer because it will expose your private keys. I recommend using a live Linux distro that you can boot into.

[Electrum]( is a good light weight client that doesn't require downloading the blockchain.  [Here is their FAQ]( which includes instructions to sweep a private key.


I'm not exactly sure what you mean by this, but you will have to sweep each of your private keys, not the wallet as a whole.
There are also several Android mobile wallets that allow sweeping.  Two are [Schildbach's Bitcoin Wallet]( and [Mycelium.](

It's a pretty good wallet. I see it get mentioned by people every once in a while, but people often refer to it as "Schildbach's Bitcoin Wallet" because that is the developer and it tells you more than "Bitcoin Wallet."

It still has about 4 days to go until activated.

What format is the file? You probably need to decrypt it with whatever you encrypted it with and put in your password. Maybe it's a text file with private keys in it?
If you get private keys you can easily sweep them into a bitcoin wallet.
@_date: 2015-09-28 17:41:58
I know it could be a privacy issue, but they could have more than one address printed out (and only use it once) and it would only need to be used in the event that their tablet wasn't charged or something wasn't working. And maybe not being able to verify one $45 meal payment would be worth making a happy customer that will come back again. I don't know. I don't own a business, just a thought.

I'm not exactly sure what your problem is, but I think it is very possible that your coins aren't lost. Multibit has been causing problems for lots of people. It seems to not display balances correctly even if it is supposedly "synced".

The "unknown" address is probably a change addresses associated with your wallet.
If you want to send 0.25 BTC and have an unspent output that is 0.75 BTC, it will use the whole 0.75 BTC in the transaction, 0.25 will go to your destination address and 0.5 will come back to one of your change addresses.
@_date: 2017-05-28 23:22:23
You can just look up your addresses on a block explorer like  and see if there is a balance. If there is, you can export your private keys from Bitcoin Core and sweep the balance into a different wallet without having to download the blockchain.

Submit your struck transaction hash to ViaBTC's transaction accelerator. 
They only accept 100 transactions every hour and it gets reset every hour, so in about 5 minutes would be perfect timing.
Edit: To answer your question, as long as you still have the URL for your wallet you should be fine even if they discontinue their service. If you take the random string that is at the end of your URL it is a brainwallet (sha256 to get private key in hex) that you can get your private key from.  For example, from this wallet URL  you can use the string "LtZQmxYICYkCLwYuKniwvAZFBEY970" to get your private key.

You "transfered the private key"? I'm not exactly sure what you mean by that, but if you imported the private key into a different wallet and didn't actually transfer the funds to a new address in your other wallet, it's likely that this imported key won't be backed up with your new wallet. I just wanted to clarify/warn you, I'd hate for you to loose the bitcoin again!

You can use this [BIP39]( on an offline clean computer and export your private keys from your Multibit HD seed.

No problem. It's kind of hard to get a transaction into that accelerator, they only accept 100 transactions an hour and it resets on the hour. The limit is usually full within a few minutes. I tried the first hour after you posted and it was already full before a minute was up.

If you already bought bitcoin and sent it to an armory address, then it is likely already there. You can check the address on a block explorer like  to see if the address has a balance. If it does, you can just export your private key from Armory and "sweep" it into Electrum. In Electrum, go to "wallet" --&gt; "private keys" --&gt; "sweep." Paste your private key there and create and broadcast the transaction to send the balance from the Armory address to an Electrum address.

It's kind of annoying that wallets use all different kinds of derivation paths isn't it :) What I would do is use that BIP39 tool to get your private keys and then just sweep them into a new Electrum wallet. If you go to "Wallet" then "Private Keys" then "Sweep" on Electrum a text box will pop up that you can paste all your private keys into. It will then let you create a transaction that sends the funds from all of those addresses to a new address in Electrum.

You can't *actually* double spend the same outputs though.  You could accidentally pay twice from *different outputs*.

I think I can help you with this. I just installed Kryptokit to test it and see how it works. It looks like you will have to "Export Brainwallet" and you can use that to get your private key (you just need to sha256 that random string). This is best to do offline because it will expose your private key and if there is any virus/malware on your computer it could steal it.
After you get your private key, you can try "sweeping" it into another wallet (I would use Electrum). Though sweeping might not work, if your other unconfirmed transaction is still out there. The next option would be to import that private key into Electrum (which lets you spend unconfirmed outputs) and send it to another address with a higher fee.
Feel free to contact me on Skype or Telegram and I can try to walk you through the process, I enjoy trying to help people with this kind of stuff! You can get my contact information from my website:

Adding on to what said, also keep in mind that the price of BTC will fluctuate.  It would probably be good to get a little more than you need in case it goes up before you make your purchase.

I'm guessing your talking about [Schildbach's Bitcoin Wallet](  There is no "Bitcoin Core Wallet" for Android.
It's possible your transaction just hasn't been propagated to biteasy yet.  It will probably show up after a bit.  You can change your blockexplorer if you click the three-dot-menu -&gt; Settings -&gt; Settings -&gt; Block explorer, then choose "blockexplorer.com" instead of BitEasy.  I prefer blockexplorer.com.

I recommend getting away from Multibit and using a different wallet. Lots of people have been having trouble with Multibit, especially with so much transaction congestion right now.

If you use the BIP39 tool that I linked, put your seed in and go to the BIP32 tab, in the "client" box change it to "custom derivation path" and start with m/0'/0
You should be able to manually go through addresses and get private keys by changing the path. (example: m/0'/0 --&gt; m/0'/1 --&gt; m/0'/2 and I think change addresses are probably m/1'/0 --&gt; m/1'/1 --&gt; m/1'/2 --&gt; etc.)

Maybe you didn't have the 4.301 to begin with?  It looks like your balance was counting a transaction twice, (from the third picture) there are two identical transactions for 1.27614251 BTC, one confirmed and one unconfirmed.  This might have to do with the malleability problem.  The fourth picture finally drops the unconfirmed duplicate transaction.

If you go to "Wallet" then "coins" it will pull up a new tab called "coins." In that tab you can choose to spend specific outputs, it should let you spend your unconfirmed output again.

A puzzle/contest like this, in my opinion, is the perfect use for a brainwallet. It's a small amount of money and it's *meant to be taken* (given away). OP wasn't recommending saving money in a "secure brainwallet."

I'm not exactly sure what the problem is with your wallet, but I see lots of people post about problems with Multibit (especially the older version.) My guess is that your bitcoins are there, and the wallet is just not showing that correctly. You should be able to export your private keys some how from that wallet and then you could sweep them into a different (better) wallet.

If you want a hardware wallet, don't get an OpenDime. It's a cool device, but like you said, it's meant to be given away. It only generates one private key and once you reveal the key, that's it. The Ledger Nano is a great device, it was my first hardware wallet.

Most wallets will generate a new receiving address after one is used, but they all are apart of the same wallet. You should be able to export keys for all of your addresses in that wallet. Hopefully that is the case for you, that the address the bitcoin is in was the first address of the wallet.

You can restore from your own set of words if you want to (or a seed from another wallet), but the Trezor will create a brand new seed each time you reinitialize it. The seed isn't "hard coded" into the device in the sense that it comes loaded with a seed from the factory, it creates a brand new seed from within the device whenever you choose to reset it.

I would export your private keys and sweep them into a better wallet (like Electrum). First download and setup a wallet in Electrum, making sure to write down and save your seed phrase. 
Here's how to export private keys from Multibit and sweep in Electrum:
Open your Multibit wallet and go to "Tools" on the menu bar, then "Export Private Keys," it will bring up the export options. Choose the file location by choosing the "export to ..." button, or just leave it at the default and take note of the location. You can also choose "Do not password protect export file" since you are just going to copy and paste them into Electrum in a minute.
Now go to the location that you took note of before and open up that newly created "multibit.key" file with a text editor. There should be a list of private keys. You'll copy and paste from here in a minute.
Next open up Electrum again and go to "Wallet" --&gt; "Private Keys" --&gt; "Sweep." This will bring up a text box that you will paste your private keys into. Now copy and paste the private keys from the multibit.key file, you'll have to only copy the private keys without the dates and other information in that file.
You should be able to click the "Sweep" button now, and then it will create a transaction and you can broadcast it if there are any bitcoin associated with those private keys.

The amount of bitcoin you are sending is irrelevant, what matters is the size of the transaction. You can check  to see a current estimate for fees. Right now it says:

Hello, sorry to hear about your trouble. I would try to export your private keys and "sweep" them into another wallet (like Electrum). Here are some instructions that I sent to someone else:

I submitted your transaction to [ViaBTC's transaction accelerator]( and it got accepted, so it should at least get confirmed by the next time ViaBTC mines a block. (could still be a few hours)

There is no bitcoin core mobile app. I'm guessing you are talking about Schildbach's "Bitcoin Wallet" which uses the orange bitcoin logo. Schildbach's wallet is good and so is Electrum, but neither use a wallet.dat. You'll just have to send your bitcoin to your other wallet later if you want it all together.

Also, I recommend switching to a different wallet, so many people are having problems with Multibit. I recommend [Electrum](

You could export your private keys and sweep them into a different wallet that doesn't to download the whole blockchain.
@_date: 2017-06-08 22:17:57
I would recommend Electrum ( It is easy to sweep and everything is backed up by a 12 word seed phrase.
@_date: 2017-06-06 06:31:53
Glad to hear it. Make sure you keep that Electrum seed phrase safe, that's your backup for your whole wallet!
@_date: 2017-06-02 02:52:39
Yeah, it's kind of hard to get a transaction through. They only accept 100 transactions an hour and reset the limit on the full hour. I can almost always get one through if I submit it right when it it turns x:00

The seed is compatible with Multibit HD, but Multibit doesn't work very well either. You could use this [BIP39 tool]( to export your keys. You should download it and use it on an offline computer for safety.
Put your seed in the top box labeled "BIP39 Mnemonic," scroll down and click the "BIP32" tab under "Derivation Path," change client to "Multibit HD" and if you scroll down you should see your addresses with corresponding private keys.
You can then "sweep" the private keys into another wallet. I recommend [Electrum]( After setting up Electrum (and writing down your seed) you can go to "Wallet" --&gt; "Private Keys" --&gt; "Sweep" and paste your private keys there to create a transaction that sends all your bitcoin from the private keys to your new Electrum wallet.

You need to export your keys using Multibit, and then with the new wallet (Electrum) you can sweep the private keys that you exported from Multibit. Here's some instructions:
I would export your private keys and sweep them into a better wallet (like Electrum). First download and setup a wallet in Electrum, making sure to write down and save your seed phrase.
Here's how to export private keys from Multibit and sweep in Electrum:
Open your Multibit wallet and go to "Tools" on the menu bar, then "Export Private Keys," it will bring up the export options. Choose the file location by choosing the "export to ..." button, or just leave it at the default and take note of the location. You can also choose "Do not password protect export file" since you are just going to copy and paste them into Electrum in a minute.
Now go to the location that you took note of before and open up that newly created "multibit.key" file with a text editor. There should be a list of private keys. You'll copy and paste from here in a minute.
Next open up Electrum again and go to "Wallet" --&gt; "Private Keys" --&gt; "Sweep." This will bring up a text box that you will paste your private keys into. Now copy and paste the private keys from the multibit.key file, you'll have to only copy the private keys without the dates and other information in that file.
You should be able to click the "Sweep" button now, and then it will create a transaction and you can broadcast it if there are any bitcoin associated with those private keys.
Let me know if you need more help, I've helped several people recover coins before.

I don't believe Multibit uses a wallet.dat file (Bitcoin Core does though), but I think you can use the same .wallet file from Multibit Classic in Multibit HD. But all Multibit wallets (Classic and HD) have been having problems with low fees. I've helped several people with both recently.
@_date: 2017-06-23 00:32:37
It looks like you are on the right track now thanks to but if you need more help, I've helped several people recover bitcoin from various wallets/issues. Hope you get it figured out one way or another! 
@_date: 2017-06-22 13:44:02
I've never used breadwallet, but I was thinking it was compatible. Isn't Multibit also compatible with breadwallet and hive? Multibit has been causing problems with sending low fee transactions, but you could at least export your private keys if it's compatible.
@_date: 2017-06-24 00:27:06
What you really should do is "sweep" your private key rather than "import" it. Importing will add the private key to Electrum (but it won't be backed up with the seed phrase) but "sweeping" will send the full balance of the private key to a different address associated with your Electrum wallet.
@_date: 2016-07-23 22:48:08
I'll give it a shot!

If you aren't able to get your bitcoin through, you can export your private keys and sweep them in to another wallet. I recommend Electrum for that.

I found this in the source code. Looks like the word list.
If you search the page for "er" it looks like there are 3,398 words.
