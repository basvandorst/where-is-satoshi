China is basically engine of whole world...
Most of BTC is traded by Chinese, or in website made by chinese.
And they also mine loads of it, because of relatively cheap electricity over there...

I don't test withdrawals often, as there is a fixed fee...
Hope it's ok, give it a couple days maybe
@_date: 2016-08-03 16:18:18
I have seen transactions canceled when trying to send with 0 fees...
Double spend means you tried to send more than your wallet had ( confirmed balance).
Most likely you will have to send again...once this is over...

We all know you can't carry much cash on ya, and you need much for trip to be worth it...
good luck changing KRW to Canadian dollars at a good rate in Korea :D
better get a friend over there, look at Skrill payments, it kinda allows changing KRW --&gt; USD with 4% fee
@_date: 2018-01-22 13:39:01
Which some says are 3 months old "news"
@_date: 2018-01-21 23:13:12
I believe some other blockchain will test those size levels before BTC...DASH maybe...
@_date: 2018-01-28 16:33:51
you can't withdraw FIAT from Bitfinex ...you can buy crypto cheaper on GDAX, send to Bitfinex and sell it there...but what is your next move? Don't trust USDT, I think GDAX doesn't trade that scam coin...and even that probably costs more thank at Kraken, where USDT had fallen to 93 cents
@_date: 2018-01-26 15:22:29
2 years for free then sell the rigs, they will probably brake down b4 that anyways...
@_date: 2018-01-01 00:54:57
Don't ignore Steem/Steemit...Eth has hit a rock wall too, Steem can support 1000 times more transactions right now and is free...
@_date: 2018-01-31 17:11:24
Sending from exchange can take too much time, so vendor might think you didn't pay at all...
I suggest you get a virtual crypto funded debit card, then you don't have to worry about fees no more, only 1 time when you fund the card...and those will be paid by exchange...not sure about Binance, but GDAX has no withdrawal fees...
@_date: 2018-01-21 17:40:06
stupid online advertising, that cost me so much and brought nothing back...
@_date: 2018-01-31 11:52:12
forget PayPal...if you want e-wallet try Payza, Payeer or Perfect money...you can also get crypto funded debit card to buy real life goods more directly...
@_date: 2018-01-29 15:29:07
if you want to quickly change BTC --&gt; USD, just generate deposit address at exchange like Kraken or GDAX...

free for user, but company still overpays
@_date: 2018-01-29 16:06:21
why pay fees extra time and send coins twice?
Just pick any exchange that has USD withdrawals and BTC deposits
@_date: 2018-01-28 11:07:52
Don't use those exchanges? Go decentralized...
@_date: 2018-01-22 15:33:35
PayPal has lower fees for U.S. only, everything is better than it for other parts of the world
@_date: 2018-01-26 15:23:55
and not a cent of it was BTC...
@_date: 2018-01-29 16:20:45
I could agree about GDAX, but what you have against Kraken?
I know DEX are the future, but most want to have some way to deposit FIAT too...
@_date: 2018-01-28 16:14:40
Many are still overpaying 90% lol
@_date: 2018-01-24 07:46:02
e-wallets like Payza, Payeer, Perfect money

@_date: 2018-01-30 12:47:18
People are just making transactions in a smarter way...more and more is done off-chain, you can't know how much 4 sure...
The other day I tipped other user some BTC satoshies on facuethub and he sent me LTC from his GDAX balance to address I gave him, instant trade and no fees paid

You can fund e-wallet with crypto... e-wallets (webmoney for example) don't require verification, if you are ok with being limited to low value purchases...
I would prefer using LN payments, but AliExpress doesn't even accept crypto directly yet...
[Spendabit.co]( and [ in particular are working great for direct crypto payments
@_date: 2018-01-28 17:15:17
isn't everything overpriced on Bitfinex?
@_date: 2018-01-21 23:15:47
decentralized exchanges, one that looks for it, will find it
@_date: 2019-07-07 20:58:11
worth every second
@_date: 2019-07-20 13:39:42
spendabit.co kinda allows searching through multiple shops, not sure how you get on their list though

if BTC is sent, there is no accept buttton lol...
Does he remember the wallet/website that he used as the receiving address?
@_date: 2017-12-23 16:26:48
so Kraken lag isn't that bad when you look at GDAX stopping trading, and other trading websites not accessible at all
@_date: 2018-05-07 09:39:25

PayPal payment can be reversed, BITCOIN not...
Let's say I agree, how soon do you need that BTC? 
I hold enough BTC in Bittrex exchange balance right now, but they also charge extra 20 000 satoshi fee if I send via BTC...there are cheaper equivalents if I send same amount via different crypto...
What you need the BTC for anyways?
@_date: 2017-03-25 08:06:53
Price was holding under $200 before the last halving, so miners shouldn't have problem with $400 right now...also the transaction fees are going up, so maybe even lower price...
@_date: 2017-03-27 18:16:14
FAUCETHUB let's you withdraw tiny amounts, and has a huge list of faucets...
@_date: 2017-03-23 22:20:19
Well they sell the coins they have mined at some point and no one stops them from manipulating the market with big blocks to make extra buck from trading...
@_date: 2017-03-31 05:49:11
Wait up to 3 days, either confirms or auto cancels
@_date: 2017-03-25 20:05:32
I thought maybe you don't want to deal with all the mess of downloading and syncing software wallet...
Kraken that I mentioned before is a great verification free way to exchange Bitcoin to USD and vice versa.
Just register on Kraken, go to funding page, generate new BTC address, and then send the BTC from poker to Kraken via this new generated address...
@_date: 2017-03-24 05:51:39
Doh yes it is, but it's already deflating compared to FIAT...

@_date: 2019-03-30 10:11:53
Can still get crypto out, so it's ok, unlike Bittrex, Poloniex and such
@_date: 2018-10-20 08:42:39
approx. on-chain data: 
Liquid is still new, hopefully major exchanges start using it, so everyone is happy...
@_date: 2017-08-17 06:25:30
You can even include a name of your choice inside the BTC address, if it's not taken yet
like 1RageTester23h4mb21nb4n44b344 random typing here...
But all start with 1 or 3 (multiSig)
@_date: 2018-10-24 13:49:31

@_date: 2018-10-30 07:21:50
Unless you trade on a Decentralized exchange, only withdrawals and deposits are recorded on-chain... some blockchains have block times that are measured in seconds...
New thing called Liquid is even going to move some of withdrawals to a side-chain if you just want to send funds from one exchange to another...

@_date: 2017-01-25 21:31:20
You shouldn't buy small amounts of bitcoin doh, if you do at least do it off chain on kraken for example...stop spamming the network and the fees will go down...
Want small amounts free, try faucets and PTCs that pay in Bitcoin, I recommend faucethub micro transaction system for collecting those small rewards.
@_date: 2018-10-24 13:45:51
cards can get blocked, pay directly, more and more shops, at least online, are accepting crypto
@_date: 2017-08-27 06:15:40
you should have just bought the game for him...spam transactions like these are what's killing the network...
use faucethub if you want to send micro amounts...
@_date: 2017-08-16 22:21:19
is it the old one?
@_date: 2017-01-08 23:41:23
Anyone got paid yet? I am testing...$1 left my balance, but no transaction record on blockchain yet...so it isn't automatic or just waits to pay some more people in bulk...

GDAX over Coinbase

30 empty blocks an hour that add 240 MB to their fat blockchain..
@_date: 2017-08-01 17:43:59
Hmm the fact they don't have genesis block, doesn't mean there couldn't be a backlog
Sold BCH on Kraken, but could have sent it instead...
now where does sent BCH go?
@_date: 2017-08-17 06:15:36
Green Day - don't wanna be an american .......
If you don't want to trade, just buy at an ATM or via PayPal
Don't store on blockchain.info, if you lose unique identifier they give you, you also lose access to your account...
Paper/downloadable software/hardware wallet all work fine for longterm hodling
@_date: 2017-08-31 15:15:11
not on Kraken
@_date: 2017-08-01 17:17:12
you haven't found(solved) a block yet, no block, no reward

Well I withdrew recently, and am still able to access my internet bank profile, have not tested debit card...
@_date: 2017-08-03 18:48:00
You just pay $20 in fees :D
Cmon who buys small amounts like that... you can earn $10 worth of BTC online in no time, poker free rolls not best option, cuz can't withdraw small amounts...steemit blog, earn trade steem for BTC on bittrex...faucets zillion of them at faucethub.io...storj (share disc space and earn), bitrad.io just listen to radio and earn lol
Many many more ways
@_date: 2017-08-06 22:18:22
You can get some bits, but only do so if you have a plan 
I started with faucets and PTC, moved on to poker freerolls and trading, risk goes up... need money to make money
Try steemit, bitrad.io, storj

Bittrex might not support trading, but they promised you could withdraw BCH
@_date: 2017-08-29 04:52:36
I thought it was much worse, BCH has some chance, if coinbase, blockchain.info users and other people don't dump free coins when they are finally unlocked...
@_date: 2017-08-16 15:41:22
One should never hold more than 4 digits of USD worth on any exchange...
Trade or get out
@_date: 2017-08-19 03:38:23
each block size adds up to total blockchain size and maintenance fees go up
give them 1 finger and they will take whole hand, 2mb tomorrow, 2gb in a year

Someone gotta be crazy to set a bot for trading new coin...
@_date: 2017-08-06 13:51:14
for crypto only they ask nothing...just withdraw as BTC, don't do fiat...
Also many confuse Bittrex (the good one) and Bitfinex (the bad one)
@_date: 2017-08-01 17:45:18
What about the 700 000 EUR and 600 000 USD trades?
They got spammed out, can't tell the volume, min volume is 50 000 satoshies though

free cheese for the mouse
people are crazy buying graphic cards that are only made to do 1 thing, crack math code, new electronics get released all the time, old ones become worthless, and BTC mining difficulty keeps going up...
Only those that can cover running costs without selling all mined BTC right away will brake even or maybe not even they, because dump is always lurking from the shadows
@_date: 2017-08-08 14:27:59
It's just an immediate complete or cancel order, not hard to bot it, but is the risk worth it...

answer is yes if you want to trade fiat
but Kraken doesn't ask for copies, unless you go for high tier...
and you can trade crypto without any verification at Bittrex and so on and on...
check decentralized ones like localbitcoins, paxful, bitsquare

Would you rather share your credit card details all over the place, or fund e-wallet (like webmoney, Perfect Money) once per month/year via crypto? Even without lightning network BTC has been working good enough for me to disable my debit card, no more monthly maintenance fees :)

Use micropayment service for receiving small payments next time
Fees depend on number and kb size of inputs, try custom send(it's under simple send) with minimal fee, like 400 satoshi per each input, around 0.00040000 total fee
@_date: 2017-04-28 21:40:26

Don't send small amounts!
blockchain has advanced send with custom fees, but minimal you can go is still  around 550 satoshi with 1 input...
that is under cent
@_date: 2017-04-25 21:17:32
Why are you making so many small on-chain transactions?
Stop increasing the fees and combine transactions or move off-chain if possible...

This dude is the best, PayPal wouldn't accept my bank, and I didn't want to pay extra fees for adding new debit card...

Don't get me wrong, not a fan of Poloniex myself...
Maybe you just shouldn't hold that much on Poloniex if you are willing to trade somewhere else...
It's the smart move to split balance between 2-3 exchanges, that way you don't lose all in case of a single hack...

Nope most people don't, why would you?
You don't pay tax making bank to bank payments, and no one can proove you are not just paying for goods...
Let them try and track your off-chain transactions, without exchange selling the data...
Yet better limit withdraws to bank to only when you really need the money (fiat)...

@_date: 2018-11-22 17:36:01
What you need for arbitrage is accounts on multiple exchanges with decent volume, but at least 1 of them must be smaller and lagging behind, so for example when price is down on bigger exchange you buy on it and send to the small one, hopefully fast enough to dump there at higher price...
Or hold balance on multiple exchanges at the same time, execute sell &amp; buy at the same time, without waiting...that however means you must stay in position for longer period of time...

= Do a job, that rewards you. 
Work online. Wage is higher abroad, extra expenses are laptop, internet access and electricity. You need to have some knowledge, but even basic data inputting job will let you to earn enough without risking your health and also working from home allows you to eat proper food.

\[cooling pad or mini-vacuum might be required for keeping temperature under control, maybe remove keyboard and whatever blocks CPU/GPU from above\].

(adj.; n. brainwashing) 
Coerced or manipulated by any number of social, intellectual, and psycho-emotional methods, to do or accept things you wouldn't have otherwise. It is often an extension of common, everyday persuasion, but goes beyond it to control the way a person thinks and responds in general to limit critical thinking itself, not simply selling a single idea or decision based on presenting information and choice. 
The goal of brainwashing is the internalization of the (unrealized or unrecognized) abusive control to where you believe and feel it necessary to enforce someone else's will as your own, unaware of your lack of free will, and usually with an illusion of stronger free will.

 you can do crypto/crypto trading on Cryptopia.co.nz or OpenLedger.io without any verification, Kraken could be more tricky, but that's what I used for getting some money to my bank ...
How much would your bank charge for currency conversion? If you receive USD or EUR, but want INR...
@_date: 2018-04-03 10:04:10
That is true, unless you want to keep those coins to remind yourself where you have been...
I wouldn't mind getting rid of local change, true bag holder of that...
@_date: 2017-05-12 21:45:21

Poloniex adds coins and delists them just as fast...

I am not trying to defend BTC here, but you don't send gold every day, do you? 
off-chain centralized shops might be solution ( deposit big amount once and get something like a gift card that you can use for small buys at that shop, fee paid only 1 time)
@_date: 2017-05-16 00:00:20
fees should go to nodes, then I wouldn't mind paying
@_date: 2017-05-11 16:19:32

Nothing is traded for those...
Use of the Zimbabwean dollar as an official currency was effectively abandoned on 12 April 2009, right after BTC was born xD
@_date: 2017-05-04 22:18:45
I wouldn't recommend right now, because BTC is on the rise and might drop just a you obtain it and also transaction times are 2-3 days...
also depends on how much the "little bit" is...
could Kraken, Bittrex, Cryptopia, Coinbase or other exchange have lower wire withdrawal fees than other option that your Poker offers?
@_date: 2017-05-13 12:39:34
getting 1st confirmation is the hardest, wait or use higher fee (double spend) 
@_date: 2017-05-10 20:06:34
I heard that new max wait time is 2 weeks if the fee is too low, getting serious
But banks can still be worse
@_date: 2017-05-11 07:00:51

Long term is?
Is there such a thing?

it's not 100 per day

shapeshift charges higher fees than any exchange that you keep balance on
On side note, I have no idea why someone would keep BTC or ETH on Coinbase...
@_date: 2018-04-25 19:25:51
BTC has history and a userbase that trusts it, people have been learning from mistakes...built a foundation that every new coin can enjoy...
At the start everything was recorded on-chain, but that failed, and we had to live with centralized microwallets and extra payment processors. Lightning node on the other hand isn't a 3rd party, it's more like personalized gift card that comes in shape of sidechain...
We both know most of BCH and BTC transactions are done off-chain today, while high value deals are more likely done on the chain...
@_date: 2017-05-31 21:25:11
Crazy small amount, 20% fee, yet it could take hours or days...
I am more interested in what you plan to do with $ 0.51 that you got left...
You can try this to speed up the transaction: 
@_date: 2017-05-31 20:58:01
Is this your address too? 
Looks like a refund address to me...

Because people don't know about exchange where you can trade altcoin to altcoin, without using BTC

failed or still waiting for confirmations? wait time up to 2 weeks if the fee is to low
@_date: 2017-05-06 07:41:02
Pay what you are ready to pay or use altcoin for transaction where possible, all those bitcoin faucets and mining scam sites are spamming network way too much
@_date: 2017-05-06 08:34:10
Fee: 0.0001466 BTC - 65.16 sat/B
Problem right now is there are 100 000 unconfirmed transactions...
only 7 are processed per second, ~600 000 per day, but so many new are made, that number of unconfirmed doesn't go down...
Try higher fee(not recommended, cuz people can still overbid) or hope weekend cleans up the backlog as it has before...

Companies have shares... And companies love keeping these shares at a low enough value, so people could buy them (by releasing more shares)...crypto unlike shares can be bought in partitions... so company can't afford to have 1 share, but crypto coin could in theory do that...
Market cap isn't good for anything...just last week you could witness people selling couple hundred million worth of tokens and market cap drop by 20 billion lol...
Another example could be sudden massive release of new tokens (done by scam coins) market cap goes crazy high until people see this and start the sell off, until true market cap is found near 0 lol...
@_date: 2017-05-10 20:59:25
Only small part of BTC is listed for sale, and not all is mined...

@_date: 2017-05-14 18:12:52
empty blocks are the real problem... once all BTC is mined, miners will only keep mining to get the fees, I honestly have no idea, why we need miners after all is mined...

The way I see it, it is still waiting to be confirmed since 3rd May, and could take up to 3 days
If after that it is still uncofirmed and BTC isn't returned to the send address, you got problem
@_date: 2017-07-30 06:26:52

international shipping will take 4 ever during holiday season, I am still waiting for things ordered over a month ago

What is the problem with waiting, when you transfer between 2 wallets you own?

Move to a cheaper country, don't buy what you don't need and yes you can retire...
200X12=2400 renting + communal (water, heating, internet) per year
food 3 per day per person, 6x7 = 42 per week per 2 persons, 2000 per year per 2 persons
5000 per year including some new clothes from time to time
300 000/5 000 = 60 years per 2 persons...
even in a not so cheap place like Latvian capital Riga could be possible
Rough rounding up, really quickie lol ... And I am not counting the fact you could grow your own food or move to place where you don't have to pay for heating...Just don't buy all the crap that breaks right away... you don't have to own a house or car to live a good life...
@_date: 2017-06-22 18:56:36
Congratz on winning!
I believe you still need to use an exchange (Kraken, Bittrex, Gemini), because banks don't accept Bitcoin directly...

you can check your Trezor receive address balance on blockexplorer
f coinbase demands if you are certain they did send

you can give the whole paper wallet away to someone in person, thus paying no fee at all
nobody forces you to use BTC that is on the paper wallet during on-chain spam attack... if you want to spend small amounts often, look at lightning network...
@_date: 2018-12-17 19:58:19
if the amount is big, you will have to get verified
@_date: 2017-06-10 14:20:11
sudden changes like that, 100% sell lol

@_date: 2017-06-10 16:42:48
I am happy with their service, except some server lag, but recently they just get too many new users, and probably should hire extra support workers
You might even get their response here on reddit
@_date: 2018-12-30 09:37:10
Iceland, cheap geothermal electricity, only mine in winter, use miners for heating, resell hardware to reduce initial cost...
@_date: 2018-12-07 08:32:15
you can tip people that are offline and don't even have lightning nodes(sounds like it's reserved balance on the central tipping bot host node so far) ...
as far as I can tell...
and you will need LN node if you decide to use tip for something other than tipping another user here on reddit
@_date: 2018-12-29 05:21:59
1st thing is getting Raspbian OS working...unless you bought SD card with it pre-installed
SD cards don't last too long under heavy load, so I suggest copying "NOOBS" to SD card, connecting 2.5 inch HDD via USB port(you will need SATA to USB adapter, 15+7 pins) and installing OS and everything directly to the hard drive

Don't put too much money into this, I am only using what I earned online, via BTC itself mostly...
@_date: 2018-12-09 09:27:51
thank you very much :)
I bought Raspberry Pi 3B+, but ordered power cable from another shop, and it's stuck somewhere...so can't test it yet...
Hope to have own LN node running soon 
@_date: 2017-06-05 21:56:00
Don't you think mining after all in mined sounds wrong? How about rewarding nodes instead
@_date: 2018-12-09 13:00:00
there was a time Asia had most trading volume, but as long as people trust USD, it remains a major pair...USDT pairs seem to have biggest volume right now even though I never use those...
it's mostly big fish traders and market manipulation by exchanges themselves, unless you find smaller volume exchange where you are the biggest trader and can cause short term manipulation yourself hehe

Well you can get BTC without any verification there...
It's 1 thing to exchange BTC with other platform users and way different to buy direclty from website owner
@_date: 2018-12-28 21:51:22
Well it's not on the main chain, so doesn't hurt, right?

Take a look at Payeer e-wallet...
In the end it depends on other person, and some verification (bank account or debit/credit card)  will be required...
Might just go for bank wire transfer right away...
@_date: 2017-06-10 07:19:53
Haven't seen no other exchange lowering fees at this time, Bittrex went from 20 000 to 100 000 too,  so no more advantage
Kraken back to the top

Why not 1 yottabyte blocks right away then?
Miners are the evil ones, they want fees to go up, because block reward goes to 0
@_date: 2017-06-09 10:41:56
I wonder why they increased the time...
@_date: 2017-06-05 20:49:10
Just connect new monitor or new laptop to the old drive and find the file that contains private keys, it could be called wallet.dat
@_date: 2017-06-04 21:41:42
Have PayPal, want Bitcoin? There is a user helping with that, I am PMing you the profile, contact him to arrange a deal
@_date: 2017-06-11 14:27:35
Directly from miners or an exchange with huge volume, bitcoin.de or even bigger

Means no one sold or bought at the price you have the order at...
@_date: 2018-12-11 08:28:53
1st ask yourself, would you sell something you can already use directly to pay online into slower FIAT that often requires another currency conversion within bank, cuz shop you can use that in only wants EURO or British Pounds, not your dollars....and on top of that somebody is trying to steal your credit card information and put you into debt
@_date: 2017-06-06 20:52:20
maybe exporting to different wallet would work...good luck
@_date: 2017-06-03 08:27:09
I hope it's just a delay caused by increased userbase
Those auto mailer services can only handle certain amount

Fees can be $100 000, if you type that in the fee field...

bottled water is a joke...
Boiling an electric kettle costs 4 to **5 cents**, depending on the size of the kettle and the rate you pay on electricity. Most commercial kettles range in size from 1.5L to 1.8L, with the larger kettles intuitively consuming more electricity.
You need to buy Kettle itself and tap water ain't free, but you will soon start saving compared to bottled water...
Can't do it in major cities, but best long term solution is water well (pure water doesn't require boiling) and reusable water container, not a new bottle every time...
Mountain river upstream could be free solution ... can drink straight from it, but getting to it can be a problem, unless you live near one...
@_date: 2018-12-14 14:45:48
You probably deposited small amounts multiple times... 
Transfer fee depends on number of inputs!
Use microwallet like faucetHUB or lightning network next time to collect even sub cents at a time without having huge fees later...

Yeah it's been extended up to 2 weeks, was 3 days...weird

There are no real benefits of running a node and costs are growing...
Nodes should be the ones that earn transaction fees as reward
One could put empty blocks on top of another at any time gap, so once all BTC is minded, no more mining is really required...and all we need is nodes
@_date: 2017-06-04 09:43:07

nice anti FUD there...
How soon will huge online shops implement lightning network payments?
"Aliexpress" in particular
@_date: 2017-06-10 12:39:39
Nothing you can do...
only trade BTC --&gt; PayPal with people you know
Also I don't suggest PayPal, they can freeze account too

@_date: 2017-06-03 22:31:09
Might pay 1000%, it's not amount you send, but the size transaction takes in the block...
Patience will pay off and everything will be alright
@_date: 2017-06-03 20:42:42
Don't listen to them, blockchain.info is good enough wallet
You might try trading though, I suggest Bittrex

But yes I wouldn't buy a hardware wallet too...

Bad thing about this is ton of small payments, so when you try to send them you might be surprised by huge fee
@_date: 2019-05-30 04:36:59

just send them over, simple as that, even empty wallet has the keys...

Not like I even know the shop, but picture of the card would help.
Trust is a problem 3rd party could solve...
I haven't sold anything myself, but just maybe [
fees might make it pointless though
