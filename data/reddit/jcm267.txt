Is John Stossel really seriously entertaining Bitcoins here? ROFLMAO!

This is just bizarre.

Personally I don't have time to plot crackpot's downfall. I'm too busy [plotting Ron Paul's downfall]( /s
Could ya tell me more about these Buttcoins that Crockpot is working on?  I was reading all these old warnings from Ron Paul about how "they" were going to make money that "they" could track electronically... and here was have a bunch of Ron Paul fans getting into this strange new phenomenon. 
And just what exactly is "Mining"? Just running a program on your computer for days at a time? This all seems pretty silly if you ask me! Maybe I'm not getting it.

The [next]( "incident report" has some guy saying a bear almost cost him 30 *thousand* dollars. WTF. These people are idiots!

You can use paypal or western union to send money overseas relatively cheaply.

Actually, troll, that dime is a collectable item now. The value of the material the coin is made with is worth more than the face value of the coin. Inflation happened. Inflation beats deflation. Deflation rewards money hoarders, modest inflation helps to encourage investment. This isn't exactly rocket science.

Bundle of sticks. You called them fags. How clever! /sarc

You'd be an idiot to spend a silver dime at the store.

Great advice!

The only practical use of Bitcoin that I've seen is to use it as a way to buy drugs securely online. It's basically just a way for crooks to hide from the authorities. For transactions there are better methods including cash, credit/debit card, check, pay pal, barter, etc. Bitcoin is anything but terrific!

Dollars, amigo, dollars! I only take dollars!

The difference is that I'm using facts and logic to support valid arguments.

So instead of tying your petty cash to a stable currency, such as the dollar, you've instead chosen to put it into an account that holds a single speculative asset that pays no income and which is far more volatile than the currency you are avoiding. Sounds like you're taking on an unnecessary amount of risk, Caffe.

Did you read what [Paul Krugman]( had to say about Bitcoin?

Also, in the US you can't exactly use precious metals as currency. You don't walk onto a car lot with a sack full of gold, the grocery store doesn't accept gold, etc.

Bitcoin is a terrible "currency". It's a joke. Look at the flash crash that happened the other day! LOL!

Sounds like a scam. Sell cheap bars of soap for $5 on a web site, also accept bitcoins. Being one of the few places to actually spend bitcoins, folks come in and overpay for soap. For $5 I can get a large package with probably 10 or 12 bars of soap in it.

What's a shekel and why would I receive them? 
@_date: 2013-04-12 17:04:00
I guess you technically can use precious metals as currency if by that you mean you're some sort of idiot who goes to the grocery store with bundles of silver half-dollars and dimes and then lets them take the face value of the coins for your purchase. Cash is king.

I remember telling a bitcoin speculator to sell while he was ahead after the price hit $1,000. I told him it was a bubble ready to pop. He was certain the price would keep going up all the way to $10,000. Just a few weeks later... $600 bitcoin. 
What a remarkably volatile "currency". 
@_date: 2013-04-12 16:48:31
And to think Caffe is one of the more cerebral of these reddit Libertarians! ROFLMAO!
@_date: 2013-02-14 15:58:18
I'd take the latter. 
@_date: 2013-02-14 16:18:13
I'm no idiot. That's why I don't get involved with this crappy bitcoin "currency".
