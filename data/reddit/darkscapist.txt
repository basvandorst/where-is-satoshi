Look at the number of inputs and outputs. The Blockchain can do as many transactions per seconds as it wants, if anyone is paying over 1 satoshi/byte fee they'll get included in the block, and if people do that who are doing normal transactions as opposed to batching, then you easily fit that many times more transactions in, 50x+. I'm somewhat surprised that your name is logical yet your way of thinking is illogical and flawed.

Not sure what you mean. Anyone could order a bunch of IP addresses on the cheap and connect them all to one node, that doesn't give them any special powers though.

DON'T DILUTE THE TOPIC. Please stop using COINTELPRO techniques. Thanks.
The Bitcoin Cash Blockchain is working exactly as it's supposed to. Compare the inputs and outputs instead of purely the amount of transactions. If people want to be included with "normal" transactions they can just pay 1.1 satoshi/byte fee and get included. The way the Blockchain is used right now is not sustainable when fees get higher and will cease upon such a treshold, but for right now, it's perfectly viable, something that can't be done on the Bitcoin Blockchain because of their 1MB blocks.
This is probably something to do with the transactions, and why they are so batched. This is a good thing, their transactions are legitimate and any other legitimate transactions which have a higher priority can pay a higher fee, you're still only talking about a $0.003 fee per "normal" transaction.
@_date: 2018-01-11 03:56:25
I am, I don't see a single reason why it couldn't work or how it'd be a bad idea?
Prove there's a technical reason against it being viable?

To the guy who deleted his post:
"I've been priced out mate. Also, I get your point, Bitcoin *is* what there is most consensus for, and the miner's and the people behind it, the people securing the network all have a majority consensus that 1MB blocks is the way to go. I have accepted that and moved away from Bitcoin. It's like Nazi Germany, the majority were FOR it, not against it, for whatever reasons. I just have to be the disagreeing minority, for best or for worse. I wish I could use Bitcoin and not have to use Altcoins, but I'm a minority. I get it. It's still my wish but yeah."
@_date: 2018-01-15 11:43:46
True, you're right.
@_date: 2018-01-15 00:03:31
No, I still don't see what's wrong with the argumentation though. Feel free to try to explain it though if you wanna be on-topic.

There's no burden. It's functioning exactly as designed. Anyone can get over this "spam attack" (it's not spam, they're paying their fees) by paying 1.1 satoshi/byte.
@_date: 2018-01-11 20:35:23
Sure they are! ;-)
@_date: 2018-01-14 23:43:21
That's a mathematical impossibility. You're mistaking nodes with mining power behind them, and yes, if someone are performing a 51% attack then sure they could change the consensus rules. But trust me, if I put up 10,000 nodes right now it wouldn't mean I'd be able to change shit.
@_date: 2018-01-07 00:56:06

Genuine spelling mistake or ad hominem attack?
Also, what the hell is Bcash?
@_date: 2018-01-14 23:41:49
All the money for the nodes went to cover my Bitcoin transaction fees.
@_date: 2018-01-14 22:23:09
With the amount of fee's I've paid in Bitcoin fees I would've had the funds to build several such nodes.
@_date: 2018-01-14 23:28:21
What does that have to do with centralization? Anyone can rent out a server from their home and there's loads of datacenters around the world.
@_date: 2018-01-29 07:21:18
You're high. Start it up and it'll tell you the words to write down, else you *could* write down your own words (from BIP0039 wordlist).
Ledger devices are TRUSTLESS, there is no tamper seal or anything, you're supposed to be able to buy it from any vendor without any risk whatsoever, as long as it's not already set up to use a seed that's written down on a piece of paper with a fucking scratch-off and you choose not to reinitialize it.
@_date: 2018-01-14 03:02:19
It's not called Bitcoin Core, it's called Bitcoin and OBVIOUSLY Bitcoin is better than Btrash in EVERY SINGLE WAY!! We have no tx fees with Lightning Network and we only pay $50 to open and close channels in fees! their blocks are already full too !1 failed NooBs!!!
@_date: 2018-01-14 23:40:52
That's just like your opinion dude.
If I wanted to I could order a dedicated server and host it over Tor or whatever the fuck, it doesn't matter, if 90% is using one host it doesn't mean anything if the 10% can carry to load and more of the 90%. I could boot up thousands of nodes myself and use a bunch of reverse proxies to inflate my numbers and claim I'm the 90% centralized host. It doesn't fucking matter. Prove that it does matter?
@_date: 2018-01-15 02:30:35
How would they hardfork without any mining power?
@_date: 2018-01-07 03:29:36
What allegations?
@_date: 2018-01-11 06:06:58
Why'd you have to do that? Also I hope you realize that 88TB/year isn't *that* much. It's not likely we'd need 1GB blocks today so by the time we'd need 'em it'd already be affordable enough, even is today.
@_date: 2018-01-14 23:44:40
Ad hominem attacks?
@_date: 2018-01-11 17:00:13
I could run a node with 1GB blocks.
@_date: 2018-01-15 00:16:51
People would use the nodes hosted at Hetzner and elsewhere? They'd need to shut down every datacenter worldwide then they're left with Tor, how the fuck do you shut down Tor? You don't.
@_date: 2018-01-07 13:57:59
Do it
@_date: 2018-01-15 00:22:53
You're way ahead of yourself though, who said anything about Pentabyte blocks?
1. Yeah, and? If it works, it works?
2. I'd do it if there ever were a "shortage" out of pure self interest.
3. Would be too centralized, like literally, but yeah, there's just too many datacenters and Tor and proxies and shit, there's no way in hell they can shut it all down. It shouldn't matter where the majority of nodes are located if the minority can handle the traffic.
@_date: 2018-01-14 23:46:45
Okay? Why are you shifting your focus to attacking my person?
@_date: 2018-01-10 23:26:52
Why couldn't we run 1GB blocks today if most people are using SPV wallets? Can't be decentralized enough? (Sure it could be decentralized enough, if not, why not?)

One of which is fixable! Why don't we work towards fixing the flaws? :P
@_date: 2018-01-15 05:14:14
Why not decrease the blocksize then? Get more competition? You're damn right that 8mb blocks are getting competition as well, the fact of the matter is that when the fees get too high they just switch to some other platform, like SatoshiDice, etc, useful services. When you say 2nd layer you might as well say altcoin or whatever else, lightning network isn't Bitcoin. (You didn't mention lightning network but I'm just saying.)
@_date: 2018-01-22 05:51:06
What's the average fees for using the lightning network now? (Except opening/closing channels, purely lightning to lightning transfers?)
@_date: 2018-01-03 21:20:44
I think calling it Bcash is an insult to these guys ^, we should call it by it's real name, Habibi Cash

@_date: 2018-01-07 13:39:13

this comment is also correct is also correct
@_date: 2018-01-30 02:54:08
How is it anti Bitcoin? They simply stated their support for the upcoming fork and would continue to support both.
I don't buy for one moment that it's because of their "security" issues, I see Coinbase, Xapo, etc, got delisted too, and they don't have any security issues to the best of my knowledge.
@_date: 2018-01-29 21:48:13
Oh okay. Maybe they are selectively scamming users and that's why it's delisted?
@_date: 2018-01-14 23:31:16
I don't see any problem with that. If that 90% gets shut down you still got the 10% left to carry the load and whatever new nodes get set up to cover.
@_date: 2018-01-15 05:11:28
I'd argue there's issues with centralization through ligning network nodes as well by not increasing the block size. Either way, wouldn't it be worth to trade off some decentralization for far lower fees? I'd argue that increasing the blocksize doesn't make the network a lot more centralized because Bitcoin uses ASIC miner's, so the people who are mining with specialized mining hardware probably already have good nodes to handle bigger blocks, if anyone, it hurts people who are doing CPU mining or something worthless like that.
@_date: 2018-01-07 03:50:01
Wow, is it really true that Bcash has stooped to this level now where they actually have higher fees than Bitcoin? Can someone confirm this?
@_date: 2018-01-29 22:34:26
Oh, I see, so they don't support Bitcoin anymore. Thanks.
EDIT: That's actually kinda fucked up when I think about it that I could've mistakenly sent my Bitcoin there and lost it...

Why are you changing subject to Bitcoin Cash? I'm *NOT* discussing Bitcoin Cash, nor have I mentioned it nor am I trying to shill for it. You're just shamelessly trying to attack my person instead of my arguments, yet again.
@_date: 2018-01-14 21:11:15
How is that completely centralized? Anyone could rent a dedicated server at any point in time, it's not *that* fucking expensive. Imagine if all the money that's being spent in Bitcoin fees were spent on fucking nodes instead, imagine how many hundreds of thousands of bad ass nodes you could have instead of paying it all in fees.
@_date: 2018-01-15 05:07:25
Which are?
@_date: 2018-01-15 12:55:07

@_date: 2018-01-15 00:25:30
But if the rest of the network can handle the traffic they could shut down as many datacenters as they could muster.
@_date: 2018-01-15 00:06:51
I'd get DDoS'ed if I did, but sure, if I ran it over Tor. I'm not mining so I don't see the purpose of me setting up a node at my home connection.
You know, I've been using Bitcoin almost religiously for the past 5 or so years and it's really a shame dare I say that I've been excluded from the party. The fees are unbearable, I really liked Bitcoin how it used to be and I really wish we could just fucking agree on something instead of off-chain solution (you could argue you could just as well use an alt-coin then and do atomic swaps as your "2nd layer" solution) and SegWit.
@_date: 2018-01-15 00:07:30
@_date: 2018-01-30 00:39:37
I have a good argument, that argument is that they are a web wallet that support Bitcoin and qualifies per the current requirements of being listed.
I find it extremely childish to delist someone who supports Bitcoin purely because they also support something else. There's absolutely no sense in that.
@_date: 2018-01-13 16:43:14
The drawback is that they're no longer using Bitcoin. LOL.
@_date: 2018-01-07 13:32:07

@_date: 2018-01-23 23:02:13
Why are you spelling it "Bitcoin Ca $h"?
@_date: 2018-01-07 03:53:10
Yeah, damn, I wonder how the fees can be so high when they have 8MB blocks that aren't even full yet?
@_date: 2018-01-29 23:14:23
I'm super confused now, so the fork never happened so why isn't it listed anymore? If the fork were to happen would they also unsupport legacy Bitcoin at the same time or rather how does them wanting to support the NYC agreement in any way, shape or form affect their ability to continue supporting legacy Bitcoin to a degree which requires them to be delisted?
@_date: 2018-01-30 05:44:08
I wrote "/s" in my reply above. I clearly got that it were meant sarcastically.
I'm not a troll, I'm trying to put a light on the fact that trusted services for Bitcoin who also supports other forks of Bitcoin are getting delisted. I vividly remember how everyone in here were supporting Coinbase and suggesting it as a great platform to buy Bitcoin, and then as soon as they introduced Bitcoin Cash they're called ConBase and everyone shouts not to use them.
I don't want Bitcoin Cash, I honestly don't. What I want is the Bitcoin I first used back in 2012, with truly negligible fees. Frictionless payments and exponential adaptation. What's happening now truly fucking disgusts me where any opposing opinion to the Blockstream narrative gets met with censorship.
@_date: 2018-01-11 16:58:48
That'd surely be a good thing though? How large could the fees realistically go with 1GB blocks, not very.
@_date: 2018-01-29 21:43:13
Oh, is that why it's delisted? I certainly wouldn't wanna use a web wallet where I risk getting doxed and losing my Bitcoins...
@_date: 2018-01-15 00:56:42
If the majority of miner's can't verify blocks fast enough the block will end up being orphaned. As far as mempool goes, any miner is free to mine blocks without any transactions in it.
I'm not sure why/what you're saying about miner centralization, being that we have extremely efficient ASIC's and it's not an EquiHash coin there will always be major major ASIC centralization
@_date: 2018-01-10 22:08:48
Why not? Would it be feasible for any sort of run, i.e. the short run till we come up with a better solution or until the lightning network is widely used?
