It's humble bundle who can't read or listen.  Then it took 10 days to respond. Said I could buy the bundle again but pay twice as much. And then said they don't have my money which is a complete lie because I see it in the blockchain

that's the exact definition of a 6% savings, six pennies per dollar, are you stupid or are you stupid?

They don't guarantee deposits?  Wtf are they doing with their money

My vision isn't the greatest, but your picture definitely looks like a large pan of lasagna.

Yes I would love to buy a walmart gift card from this random 0 feedback dude on ebay. 
Top notch research bro.
@_date: 2014-06-11 01:29:20
I lost out on the deal I don't have my money.  I will never buy another humble bundle again.

No they have no idea how bitcoin works. They already said the transaction was refused.  How does a bitcoin transaction get refused?  I did read his reply That's like me going to visa or the bank when I get overcharged.... no I go back to the store. This is inexcusable.

Actually malware was my first thought.  So I chose not to reply to parts that were not applicable.  I asked for helped in determining if those wallets were humble bundles.  Anywho, I contacted coinbase shouldn't be an issue getting a refund if that is in fact their address and I don't have my items.

thats called staggering and is illegal

I find this comment highly offensive.

Yep, I've spent thousands on Gyft, but as soon as Egifter started 6% I jumped ship, customer loyalty is a two-way street.

I'm actually on my way to the eye doctor right now. Think I'm going to pick up some Fazoli's.
@_date: 2014-06-14 06:14:03
 why are you falsely advertising e-gift err doesn't have Walmart gift cards
@_date: 2014-06-11 01:35:21
Never had a problem with them either,  until I had one.

Just got a reply from Coinbase which proves humble bundle has no idea what they were talking about.
Daniel replied:
Thank you for contacting Coinbase Support.
My apologies for the trouble, but It appears that your payment was received after the 10-minute order timeout expired. As such, our system marked the order as "Expired" and forwarded the funds to the merchant's account for refunding. 
In order to resolve this issue, you will need to contact the merchant directly and request that they either refund or fulfill your order. They should be able to locate your payment with the information below: 
Item name: Humble Weekly Bundle: RPG Maker (uid X9FKDK2KFUB72) for XXXXXX
Item total: $12.00
Amount sent: 0.02079600 BTC
Order address: XXXXXXX
Order code: XXXXXXX
I hope that clears things up. Please let me know if you have any further questions regarding this issue and I will be happy to assist.
EDIT: Oh and humble bundle closed my ticket, Were they just expecting me to lay down so they could steal my money and act like nothing was wrong?

This is correct op just admitted to a federal offense on the Internet
@_date: 2014-06-11 01:14:02
So just forward the emails to coinbase as proof I never received items?  I don't know hOw else to prove it was me.
@_date: 2014-06-19 16:48:42
Their silence is troubling.

what are all of the possible extension file names for a bitcoin wallet, I could've swore I backed it up, but I just can't find it.
I know .json and .dat any others?
@_date: 2013-11-09 15:35:32
No offense, but that's terrible advice, I called the lows on bitcoin and it worked out really well for me. There is no reason to leave a market you have made every right decision about, and drain all of your worth into a market which is constantly devaluing(USD)
@_date: 2013-11-09 15:37:07
egifter and gyft don't have walmart gift cards anymore, not sure why... I was researching and found a website called bitspend, not sure what it was, but it seems like it was a scam.

I'm spending my bitcoins, just not the ones i bought recently. I'm spending the ones I bough in the beginning of the year
@_date: 2013-11-09 19:21:12
Precisely the reason I invested in bitcoins, I took the leap so there is a balance of people who have a stake in bitcoins. I'm sorry if you disagree with my ways, the fact is I have the money, just not in a currency I desire. I'm sorry if you can't understand that.
