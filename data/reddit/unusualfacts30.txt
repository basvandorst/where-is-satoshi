not if you have huge infrastructure in place and you can pump &amp; dump as required to make profit. That's why they're called whales.
You're miner..I am miner. If we both get together we become one big whale..now lets multiply our group with 1000 miners. Hey..looks like we have full control of the market now.
Oh wait..that's not making us much profit so lets create altcoins so dumb people start investing their BTC in altcoins while we still have full control of altcoins and btc.
Now, they're making 1000x profit by pumping and dumping everything. If you don't believe me..look at history of any coin..it comes to exchange..there is pump and then it goes to chit...oh wait..another pump comes in out of nowhere in a month and then it's down for another 6 month. Just a coincidence? I don't think so.

Bitcoin is commodity. People need to understand that if you want to gain money you have to invest it on something that's valuable in a country.
Who decides value of BTC? Internet.

It's a set up not a technical issue. Who do you think owns circle.com? A rich miner...he is not making profit when BTC is crashing..is he?

Except that in stock market there is news available to figure out the market trend while in bitcoin whales do as they please and they're hidden so there is no news about them. Therefore you can't figure out the waves even if you want to...
flip a coin and cross your finger and hope that it comes out on your side = BTC market.

We don't know where the end is. Bitcoin exchanges have turned into whale and there are no surprises anymore.
There is no one guy holding all the bitcoins. Ever since bitcoin raised in price these exchanges have turned into HUGE whales. 
It'll fall to the ground until US $ decreases in value and then you'll see sudden pump. Just track $ and you'll know when BTC will rise. Either way I have given up on BTC because it's horseshit and you never know when you'll step on it.
I would rather trade stocks..at least I know when shitstorm is coming.
It can't break the threshold because it hasn't gained any value. It's more profitable for whales to pump &amp; dump than wait for another 10 years to see if it'll raise in prices.

Who said bots will always be on your side?

Bitcoin gains value and loses value whenever whales decide. We have no control..we're just a puppet thinking we're going to be millionaire.

Just consider your loss and get out of the market. If you can afford to lose that $577 stay in and hope that whales change their mind.
Pro tip: whales will lose more money if BTC doesn't go up.
What would you do if you were whale and if you din't cash it...you would risk million dollars worth of BTC.
Ponder upon it and decide your next movement.

Whale threw the order
Whale ate the order
Use logic. If people have money to eat up 30k BTC order then why price hasn't moved much? I assume people must be buying lot of BTC yet the price stays the same after hours?
Doesn't make sense if you really think about it.

1. Bitcoin is controlled by whales. So, it's not smart to invest in something that you have no control over and you don't know when whale is going to decide that it's enough and he cash out all the BTC leaving you with nothing.
2. Altcoins. People are invested too much into altcoins and they're making exchange websites rich. Until all altcoins disappear from the market BTC won't be adopted by everyone. Right now, crypto is a joke to most people because new one being created on daily basis with names such as "Doge, Potcoin, XXXcoin".
How do you expect people to trust BTC when it's listed next to a internet meme?

Coinbase takes 5 days when you use bank account to make purchase. Money shows debited same day when you make purchase but coin doesn't arrive few days later. They mention it when you make purchase.
I believe circle is no different and they're using the same method. You should be worried if BTC doesn't show up after a week but either way this should be mentioned on the site.
I have more confidence in Coinbase because paypal, overstock uses them and they're pretty big now because they were the first one to come up with something like this. I wouldn't use circle

That's not the only exchange doing it. It's pretty common with all exchanges. This is why they need to be removed as middleman.
@_date: 2014-10-06 14:28:13
Well you can always keep those BTC.
1 BTC is always one BTC even if it converts to 0.
@_date: 2014-10-06 14:13:56
Bitcoin is based on a universe where there is no government and no regulation and whales decide the rules.
Bitcoin decides what bitcoin is...it could be 1 cent tomorrow but hey ..who cares? 1 btc = 1 btc. Right?
Unless people take all their money out of other alt coins..BTC is not going up in prices and it'll possibly go to 0.
@_date: 2014-10-06 19:39:46
Yeah I hope you're right. Just my speculation though. I'm staying out of the market for now until dust settles down.

Real loss of BTC is when consumers lose interest. It's not when whale crashes. BTC has been on downtrend for a while now.
@_date: 2014-10-06 17:56:16
Market din't eat it. It was a trick to make people believe that BTC is holding strong as always. Quite possible that same whale ate it.
@_date: 2014-10-06 13:38:52
It's about time bitcoin falls on its ass and innocents realize that they're being scammed by whales. This was not the intention of BTC but this is all it has turned into. 
Price falling because people are spending BTC on other coins and losing it back to exchange (whales).
Whales getting bigger while people getting poorer.
@_date: 2014-10-06 17:04:04
I could definitely use those pennies after I bought BTC for $400. Sounds like a sweet deal to me.
@_date: 2014-10-06 18:37:04
It could be whale who wanted everyone to think market is going to crash but then it bought its own order to make people think it's not going to crash.
Whale makes profit due to panic buying...whale crashs the market when said profit is made. What is that said profit?
$50 rise means $1750000 profit for whale before it crashes the market.
@_date: 2014-10-06 14:38:23
that's all BTC will be worth in coming months.
