You're arguing the technical aspects of what I said and missing the point of it. The system in place works against a huge amount of the population. When I said:


I was alluding to the fact that upward mobility for blue collar workers is becoming impossible with all this downward pressure. You can't deny that. The baby boomer generation enjoyed things that are not possible anymore. Taking out loans to buy things was an exception back then, now its a rule. Shit i'm ~$110,000 in debt FROM BREAKING MY ARM. That's 3 years (after tax) of my income if I send every penny their way (obviously not possible). It's pretty hard to support this system when that's the reality of it. Sad part is, there's 10's of millions of people right there with me.

The business should fail but dumbasses keep feeding it money because they're blind with greed. 
No business could afford to give refunds if the payment they used went up 1000% 
These businesses aren't holding the BTC, if they were this wouldn't be an issue. You might be able to buy their product with BTC but they can't pay their bills and purchase parts with it. Hence why it is auto converted.

Expanding on that, at least with a deflationary currency you would possess the currency that would be worth more in the future. Whereas with a credit card, you're securing a loan for 100%+ interest on the item you're buying.

True. Although the dollar value is the only thing being worth less. I would take this mechanism over the other option though. The block rewards can fund the growth period and tx fees can fund it after mass adoption and the rewards are small/done with (by sheer volume tx fees *should* be cheap when we get there). The future shall be interesting for sure. 
@_date: 2014-02-09 18:51:37
I'm well aware of that. It's called RISK. I'll trade a possible 100% loss for a possible 1000%+ reward. You know that old saying "Don't invest more than you're willing to lose"

I believe he was pointing to the consumer psychology toward credit cards. By using a credit card you are sacrificing more money to own something RIGHT NOW. That phenomenon directly contradicts economists assertions that with a deflationary currency that WOULDN'T happen. 
Obviously deflation is more complex than that. That's just a partial slice to a large pie.

Same here. We're to the point where we borrow from the future to pay for the present. GREAT for lenders and businesses, TERRIBLE for sustainability and the average joe.

Consumer debt is sitting around 11 trillion dollars. Comes out to ~$38,000 per man, woman and child in this country.

Basically pointing out, in theory, why bitcoin is so great. Hold debt in inflationary currencies and savings in deflationary ones. 
You can only leverage consumers so much before the same issues that deflation causes happen anyways. With income inequality trending the way it is, we're getting close to that point.

Yep and yet that's not happening. Oh taxes are being cut but spending is completely out of control. We should be lowering the deficit but it's being blown up as we speak. We're in a bull run and yet added 20% to the deficit. The bull run we've been in is being completely stomped out via mismanagement by our current administration. Again, the self touted "fiscal conservatives" are proving to be anything but...

You're entitled to your opinion but I disagree with nearly everything you said. 


You have that completely backwards. The majority of the altcoin run up was due to bitcoin's explosive growth. Many of the coins that were shilled so hard on reddit were literal nobodies until November to December. Big players moved their massive gains into alts months before the real boom, stoked the price up and cashed out to the noobs, story old as time. 
The majority of altcoins have the market cap they do because the vast majority of the supply isn't traded of the market. Besides buying and selling and transferring on exchanges, they don't do anything. They exist to fool novices who think they missed the train on bitcoin and the big players cash out the positions they got into before the altcoin boom. Same shit happened in 2014. The magnitude was similar if you take the size of the ecosystem into account. 
The fact that you think those triggers are equal in magnitude to 2014 is laughable. When Mt. Gox went down it took 800,000 BTC (8%of the total supply, or 10% if you don't count satoshi's) and probably the top 2 exchange with it all in one go. Not only that, but the largest player in buying (China) also banned it within a few months of each other. The closest things this cycle were bitconnect imploding and Korea exchanges getting hacked but promising to cover all the losses. Seeing the price about face without all those LEGITIMATE, sentiment changing triggers is actually the most reassuring thing ever to me. It goes to show that the boom/bust cycles crypto goes through are more inherent to the tech than I first thought. 
@_date: 2018-06-23 18:24:54
Interestingly enough, the crash in 2014 made sense in a way. Way smaller global market depth, the Mt. Gox fiasco, China ban however many times and other triggers I'm probably forgetting. Seeing the market  behave the same way without any significant triggers leads me to believe these boom-bust cycles are more inherent to BTC that we may realize. 
Edit: a word

The money went to trillion dollar wars on terror and drugs. Rock solid investments, if you ask me. So much better than the health as financial stability of the most vulnerable! 
You do realize if we hadn’t been cutting taxes for the last 40 years then the accounts wouldn’t of been raised right?
And yes, the country IS fundamentally different. We have 322,000,000 more people living here than we did in 1800. If you and a SO has surprise octuplets do you think you could live on the same budget as when you were single?

And republicans explode the deficit because they increase discretionary spending (as in expenses we have a say over) as well as decrease our income as a nation by lowering taxes on the Uber wealthy and corporations. Fiscally conservative, NOT

Don't forget the block rewards dropping. Miners gotta sell those rewards to fund business activity. Smaller BTC rewards leads to smaller influence on price when they sell.

Cash low is king, you've got exactly the right plan with your hoard. Too many idealists here missing the forests for the trees.
@_date: 2019-06-03 20:40:57
Adoption is only considering the demand side of the curve. The reward halving drastically adjusts the new supply curve downward every 4 years. Miners are some of the largest sellers due to business expenses. Every block produces 12.5 BTC currently but in 2032 that number drops to \~ 0.8 BTC per block. Currently, BTC isn't even *that* scarce yet. In short, there's mechanisms in place that don't require the USD to fail for BTC to reach insane figures.

This post is complete shit, jesus how does this get upvoted! So, to recover, either demand has to change, or demand has to change? Nothing about supply? Completely disregarding HALF of the equation. Gee, I wish BTC had some mechanism that reduces the new supply over time...something to do with the blocks maybe?
The block halving was cleverly included to reduce supply which then induces demand by competing over fewer coins.
Gotta love the blind leading the blind. Makes it easy for me to make more coins though : ).

The investigative report is given to a prosecutor who's job is to decide which laws were broken based on the information provided. The prosecutor would then decide wether or not to move forward with criminal charges and what charges to move forward with.

2013 here. Remember the pain fondly. Looking back, the fast that the price is dropping like crazy WITHOUT the mt. gox fiasco or China banning BTC a million times actually reassures me. It goes to show that it woulda happened anyways. Price can't go up forever and the demand side of the equation has to run out of steam eventually. Then the block halving happens and adjusts the supply side of the equation to balance it out. Beautiful to watch in real time.

My claim is that you're not looking at the market in the right way. 
I don't understand the mentality that altcoins HAVE to solve an issue with bitcoin to have a place in this market. Cryptocurrencies are money. As long as people have an agreed upon value of them they will be worth whatever that value is. A lot of that value is in how strong the network is and as of right now LTC has the 2nd strongest network. 
That network is only going to grow and that will increase adoption. Once LTC becomes as easy to buy as bitcoin its value will rise dramatically. 
You think the market is wrong for a very particular reason. I think the market doesn't care about that reason.
Just sit back and imagine all the redundant companies out there. If your mindset on the market held true, none of them would exist.
