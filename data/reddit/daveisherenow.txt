Or perhaps the person did not have the funds available or had car repairs or hospital bills or "life in the way".

Thank you for the encouragement and information! I picked up a Ledger, I need to move everything over...you never know. Agreed on the realized gains/losses. Right now it's all just a virtual loss. I believe things will continue to improve! Best of luck!!

The same thing ran through my mind, and the thought of that really scared me!

I did notice that LTC took a $10 plunge down to about $242 while BTC was making its run.  Maybe unrelated, maybe related.  The more I can understand how things have an effect on each other, the better I can "attempt" to put my money into the market at the right time.

Climbing up to 19,000 today, I can't help but watch and wonder what is going to happen.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:54:24
What happened Uncle Cococopuffsss??
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:24:34
Yes. Yes it is...LOL

Is there a way to know which way the break will be after a wall is broken through?  Other factors to look at to help determine?
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:39:47
Keep buying.
@_date: 2017-12-17 02:03:35
Are the people "chomping down the wall" hoping to get a piece of coinage before the large jump to the price at the top of the wall?
@_date: 2017-12-24 04:19:25
Hollibob got a quarter of a coin!
@_date: 2017-12-18 15:09:20
Not if it's steadily climbing without ever dipping!  Then you're just buying low(er) compared to the current day's price.

If you're just getting into bitcoin, there's more things you (we) have never heard about or understand than you have "researched all of"...just keep reading.
$100 is a good starting amount to play around with Coinbase and ensure you and your referrer get your $10.

Sell, buy, hodl...fuck!

I appreciate you taking the time to write all that out!  I'll take a look at what you said on GDAX tonight when there's not kids running around asking question every 13.7 seconds! LOL
@_date: 2017-12-18 14:49:38
You can buy direct on GDAX with a minimal fee.  You can buy via limit ordrers on GDAX with zero fee, the way I understand it.

I can relate.  I was at a party last night and didn't want to keep checking my phone, so I set a buy at 19,200 since it was mid-high 9s all day.  FOMO.  Saw I bought at 19,200 and it continued a good ways past that. :(

I can't stop.  Took a while for Coinbase to stop spitting out errors at me.  Curious how low it will dump.
@_date: 2017-12-25 04:04:16
Could be brass stamps.
@_date: 2017-12-17 05:27:48
Yeah, well, that's like just your opinion, man.
@_date: 2017-12-12 22:55:10
Are we sent forms like a 1098 or something that shows gains?  Are we only taxed on what's moved from our say, Coinbase account back to our bank?
Honor system?
@_date: 2017-12-15 02:41:31
ELI5 please!
I saw the wall but trying to understand it.  I hear about "walls" and how they need to be "chewed through".  I watched this one "come down" and the price jumped from 17,250 up to 17,500.  As a buyer and seller seeing these walls, what action should be taken (if any) or what predictions might be able to be made about them?  Any strategy with them?
Thank you.
@_date: 2017-12-16 15:46:15
I just don't know what to do!  Will it hit 19,000 and then take off!  Will it hit 19,000 and then crash down?  Should I be ready to buy, or sell?  GAHHHH!
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:36:10
Just getting on today; why's everyone mad at Coinbase?
@_date: 2018-08-28 17:49:12
FOMO is a MOFO.

Hey that's me! Miner BTC value is looking a whole lot better too. I held what I bought at very inflated prices, and feeling much better about that right now. Not sure if I wanna continue to hold long, or sell, correct, buy again.
