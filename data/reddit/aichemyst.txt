Please tell me who knows more about valuation than Warren Buffet,  for how much would you buy or sell Google or Apple?

I love watching his documentaries, and see his one son who sold his shares of Berkshire cheap to launch a music career.

Actually his past wife hooked him up with his mistress, whom he married when his first wife died.
He's been open about it the entire time.

He spends all day long researching value and ways to make money (his family has claimed to a fault).  
I've never heard him give his opinion on something he hasn't done his homework on.  He's not ashamed to admit 'I don't know,' when he hasn't.
Edit:  Not saying I agree with his assessment, just saying I don't believe he's making up a baseless opinion on the spot.

Labor.  How much sweat can you buy is the true "value."

Truth.  He's not ashamed of his lack of understanding in how tech companies make their money.
However, he is a brilliant assessor of value.
