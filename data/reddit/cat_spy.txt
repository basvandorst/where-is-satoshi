Great, because if anyone on here deserves $1000 it's the guy who's demonstrated a complete lack of financial responsibility.

Not saying this will happen but it sounds like it could, if the police ever say call you up one day and say that this whole thing can end and you can keep all your money, if you just come down to the station and sign something, do not do it. Do not fucking do that, ever, no matter what they say to you.

Yeah, people on reddit are freakin ridiculous.

Well he is right though. Half a Breaking Bad episode in season 2 of meth is a pretty absurdly specific unit of measurement.

Fair question. This stuff is really important to understand for your life as a whole, not just in regards to your current predicament.
Suppose, hypothetically, that the guy you were selling the bitcoins to was using them to launder money. It is conceivable that, perhaps even based on the specific wording of the law in your jurisdiction, by assisting that guy you could conceivably be seen as guilty of a money laundering crime *even if you didn't know you were doing it.*
Now what you would probably like to think, is that the police down at the station will look at this situation and say, "OK, well this one guy is clearly the real criminal here and this other guy was just being used as a patsy, so we can forget about him." 
That won't happen, at least not in this universe. What will happen, is that they'll look at the laws on the books and say "OK, well this one guy is clearly the real criminal, and look, this other guy technically broke a law also, so we can nab both of them! We just need to get a confession out of the second guy!"
Police have different tactics to get people to admit to crimes. One is to scare you into confessing, but that isn't going to work when you don't think you've done anything wrong. However, what could work, is getting you to admit to something that you did, because you thought there was nothing wrong it.
They will literally pretty much say to you "if you sign this paper we won't arrest you," and then as soon as you sign it they will arrest you. This happens to people every single day, and you are not special. In the eyes of the police, you are just another law breaker. They do not care if you're a good person.

What does Jesse's beard have to do with it
