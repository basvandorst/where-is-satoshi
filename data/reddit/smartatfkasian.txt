Every real assets with limited supply and value had never been dropped more than 60%. Stock for legit company, gold, house 
@_date: 2018-01-19 13:11:52
impossible, it is because we don't know how much fiat is actually circulating in the market. 
@_date: 2018-01-19 13:09:37
you cannot be serious.....

Hedge your postion with margin trade, report only margin trade profit.
In Australia, if you hold asset of over 1 year, you have 50% discount in tax

You just need a buyer for your short. You do not need to own BTC to short 
So the fact is if someone want to short BTC today ($6500), how much the taker are willing to pay.

It will be cash, and just like trading on your exchange. You will get margin call or get liqidiated. Most people trade same day contract and some play longer timeframe for hedging purpose.

I not sure how it works, but if they set at 30%-40% captial requimrnet for opening a postion, they don't need to hedge the position in a liquid market? This is why a bank providing BTC future means that BTC is a legit asset class. Since the only risk is default risk and it can only be caused by total market crash.

If today price is 6500 the ask price of 1 year future contract would be 10000 or 3000
@_date: 2017-11-22 05:27:29
1. The future price will plummet, Future of today price may be cost only $100 ($100 to buy 1 BTC after 1 year)
2. Whales will buy all the short contracts (they are long call).
3. Whales will push BTC price as high as possible, until the expire day of the contract.
4. Whales and people holding BTC will earn money.
So, 100 billion of shorting is not possible.

I don't like this action, not a fan boy of cash but you are tearing someone hard work. ��
@_date: 2017-10-12 10:01:08
Don't worry, in technical view, 5000 will be new low, you are actually buying low now.
There is still half of million of BTC need to be buyback someday, they can't wait to close their short at $5000

I will migrate to Japan with my coins

If you become billionaire with Bitcoin, i am sure government will investigate your tax records for whole life. I am sure it will be easy to do so as exchange already got enough information from you.
When people caught with tax evasion, they will need to pay back the capital gain plus inflation in $dollar value (which will be extremely high if US $ replaced by Bitcoin) + extra % penalty on top of it + jail time. So literally you would lose everything you have. 
So should you risk your future billion? For me, I will never realize any capital gain from Bitcoin, hold on to your coins and use them to buy houses after 10 years. In this case, you are legally tax free with your gain.

You won't need to pay CGT if you use Bitcoin to buy house.
Don't risk being caught of tax evasion when you become billionaire with Bitcoin.
