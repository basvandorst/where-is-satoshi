Metal, they will have a Visa card that comes with an FDIC backed bank account. Rumors going around that it might be Bank of America.
 Wells Fargo is a dog shit bank anyways.

I was done with Coinbase after my first 3 transactions. Greedy bastards. 
@_date: 2019-07-14 18:45:02
Hands down my favorite too. This is the one I recommend to everyone interested in learning more about crypto.
@_date: 2018-09-03 23:10:28
Lol. That made me laugh. 
@_date: 2018-08-12 18:56:42
Great, now we’ll never hit our target. 
@_date: 2018-08-11 22:51:12
He was certainly ahead of his time. :)
@_date: 2018-08-12 03:05:58
I thought all these things when I started accepting Bitcoin for my business. That’s been about a year. Not one single transaction, no support, no new customers. I’ll be changing entirely to Metalpay for merchants. All my customers will receive discounts and not only will I pay zero fees but I’ll be getting paid as well. It’s a no brainer for business owners. 
@_date: 2018-08-12 18:52:06
He’s always been a favorite of mine, thanks for the chaos theory link, fascinating!

What is funny is all you learn about people through abstraction. Also, “your”

There are a lot of factors that TA does not account for in Crypto, I’m a much bigger believer in cost averaging and holding, plus it’s far less stressful. 
@_date: 2018-08-12 18:59:48
I felt it was time. :)
@_date: 2018-05-20 20:04:05
What an absolute fool. Maybe an ok decision if he didn’t have a family but to jeopardize his children’s stability and security for possible riches. Unbelievable. 
@_date: 2018-05-17 01:55:45
That’s rad 
@_date: 2018-08-13 06:28:32
It seems to be beyond your intellectual grasp that it was a fun joke and nothing more. But hey, if it makes you feel big pretending you’re superior to others. Have fun. Jackass. 
@_date: 2018-05-20 20:51:56
Lol. No doubt. 
@_date: 2018-05-20 21:48:35
Apparently fools are plenty these days. Hope you never breed.  
@_date: 2018-10-13 16:27:04
I’ve only been in the crypto space for about 1.5 years. Bitcoin was my first purchase and it was exciting. Every experience since has been a terrible one. Once I realized how slow and expensive it is Compared to others I stopped using it entirely. Missing the boat is certainly part of that as well. I have advertised accepting Bitcoin for my business never receiving any interest or support. Ever. I’ve moved on to more promising projects with a higher likelihood of mass adoption and projects and tokens or coins that I actually use in the real world.
@_date: 2018-10-14 03:32:00
Hopefully it’s ranch and not pepperoni dog fart. 
@_date: 2018-10-13 17:03:27
I hope so too. I want Bitcoin to do well, it has given me so much hope for our future and proves that the people still have a strong voice among all this corruption in government and banks. Regardless of how well it does or doesn’t do I will always love it. Just at this point I have no interest in using or owning it. 
@_date: 2018-10-05 21:11:18
Crumbs App. Fast and easy. 
@_date: 2018-10-26 15:07:29
They had a rough time there for awhile but they’re back and better than ever. 
@_date: 2018-10-29 23:34:36
That’s a pretty bold statement. Sources please.    
@_date: 2018-10-13 15:24:50
How does this sound shady? Metal Pay is FDIC insured. Lol. They have set aside a portion of their total supply to use as the rewards for using Metal Pay which holding improves your credit score in their system. This is a bridge to adoption and the first usable product that moves both fiat and crypto. It’s funny, you guys want adoption to happen but don’t support projects like Metal Pay that are already making it happen. 
@_date: 2018-10-13 15:47:35
I understand your concern and that’s true in many cases, just not this one. There is a solid use case for this token (which is explained on their site), so much in fact that it’s the first project ever to be relisted on Bittrex. They are adding merchant services soon but there is nothing stopping people from using it now. I use it for my business as do other businesses I use. 
@_date: 2018-06-26 04:59:14
No, Belfort 
@_date: 2018-06-09 17:45:30
The Paypal problem as a whole has already been solved by Metalpay, plus everyone gets paid to use it, buyer and seller and a single transaction. Me personally, I can not wait to see the fall of Paypal. 
@_date: 2018-06-25 20:26:22
I’m sure the only good investment for him is ripping off hard working, honest people and then throwing his friends under the bus when it’s time to pay for the crimes. Surprised he hasn’t done an ICO. PENIS. 
@_date: 2019-10-07 13:40:18
Well, would you buy AOL stock at its all time high when you could buy Google for bargain basement prices? Of course you wouldn’t. That’s why you don’t buy Bitcoin and you do your own research in this space. There are tons of better options with brighter futures.
@_date: 2018-06-25 21:30:06
Look at his current YouTube vids, the guy is still bragging about all that he did. He’s proud of it. That’s not the mentality of someone who has changed. Not to mention the type of character you would have to have to do what he did in the first place. 
@_date: 2018-06-18 18:50:49
Haha, zero tolerance policy for integrity. 
@_date: 2018-06-18 18:37:36
Honest, hard working people are the new criminals. 
@_date: 2019-06-19 14:09:59
You need to have a goal and a plan and stick to that no matter what. Ask yourself why you’re doing this. Is it to make life changing money or just make a quick buck?  For me it’s life changing money. I don’t care otherwise so I have a set number, when it hits that I sell 50% then I have a second sell point. If you don’t follow your rules you will lose.
@_date: 2018-06-17 20:10:04
That’s why Metalpay is going to be so successful. I’m one of the alpha testers, I signed my mom up who’s 81 and now she’s testing it, it’s that simple to use. Phone number or QR code anywhere in the world. Plus sender and receiver gets paid to use it. 
@_date: 2019-02-24 17:10:23
No 5318008 for us. 
@_date: 2019-06-06 15:53:51
Ah. Ok. So those that hold a lot are the gatekeepers. So that would be Satoshi, CW, Roger Verr, Jihan Wu and so on for Bitcoin. Lol. I’d take Ripple labs or David over CW, China or Roger any day. Decentralized my ass. �� Don’t forget XRP actually has several use cases aside from buying coffee mugs online. ;)
@_date: 2019-06-20 05:02:09
Bitpay is funded and run by the scum of the universe.
@_date: 2019-02-26 17:29:59
You won’t. You MIGHT get lucky if you go to Zimbabwe. Just do what I did and settle for the Billion bill or a lesser one. Still impressive and cheap. 
 
@_date: 2017-11-15 05:49:46
Just pulled everything out last week, took me about an hour to make the last trade I needed to make the exit. Holy mackerel. 
Do you think it’s still safe to wire funds to do I can then transfer them to Bittrex? I use Bittrex exclusively now even though I’m not a big fan of Tether but believe they have a $10k min for wires and Coinbase fees are ridiculous. 
@_date: 2019-06-06 14:12:24
And who is the gatekeeper for XRP?
@_date: 2017-11-15 16:20:27
Thanks for the reply softlarch, that and trading with USD were really the only reasons I used Kraken in the first place, glad to know I"m not going to have to go through Coinbase
@_date: 2019-02-16 18:19:22
Let’s see, horrible design, gaudy AND it’s in Forida. I’ll offer 1 Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-11-29 01:14:03
I’m betting on that too. Fingers crossed �� 
@_date: 2018-11-29 01:03:31
It’s coming. Don’t worry. I think at least $3k
@_date: 2018-03-17 21:34:25
Very cool, you can add my company. 
We provide service and sales for fire suppression systems primarily for restaurants. Fire extinguishers, emergency exit signs and lights plus a large selection of safety products in the San Francisco Bay Area. 
Will also accept many other cryptocurrencies.
@_date: 2018-11-28 15:26:57
Don’t worry, it’s going back down. 
@_date: 2018-11-30 15:26:48
$21 trillion. 
@_date: 2018-03-31 18:34:46
I became an economy expert when I bought my first crypto. There’s nothing crypto can’t do for you. 
@_date: 2019-01-29 00:02:21
Don’t give them any ideas. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 22:42:44
Following. 
@_date: 2019-01-10 22:01:00
That’s really gonna hurt when it’s $500 here soon. 
@_date: 2019-01-10 23:40:33
Sell now and you won’t have to 
@_date: 2018-03-06 17:27:33
They’ll have a hard time competing with Metal that rewards BOTH the merchant and the customer with 5% crypto back plus an array of other incredible features. 
@_date: 2018-03-11 18:01:44
Well, that’s the dumbest thing I’ll see all week. Glad I got that out of the way. 
@_date: 2018-02-14 14:28:00
A Ponzi scheme? Lol. The only way it’s a Ponzi will be by sucking all the money out of whatever shitcoin you’re invested in. Clearly YOU need to do some research. It may turn out to be a shitcoin as well but it’s not a Ponzi. 
@_date: 2018-03-13 05:21:38
What’s even more shocking is that people are actually still using Coinbase. 
@_date: 2018-07-28 00:18:28
Just used Gemini for the first time, 4 days and still waiting for my wire to go through. Had I known it wasn’t the 1-2 days like they state I would have just used Coinbase and paid zero fees. Last time I use them. 
@_date: 2018-07-04 22:41:41
Congrats! I started accepting it in October along with Ether and Litecoin. I also know some other contractors accepting it as well but so far zero interest. 
@_date: 2018-07-11 20:47:32
£12!!?!  They’re 99 cents on EBay, better buy some more to average down. 
@_date: 2019-09-22 21:08:38
Check out who funded them. You’ll have your answer.
@_date: 2019-09-22 20:15:51
Bitpay’s funded by the scum of the universe. Serves them right.
@_date: 2018-07-11 21:09:33
What!? Not Verge exclusively? ��
@_date: 2018-04-22 19:24:00
That is one thing you can certainly count on unfortunately. 
@_date: 2018-04-22 08:00:07
Wow, that’s crazy. Not me! I make sure to invest all my money in trustworthy secure investments like BTOs, Mutual Funds, subprime mortgage loans and other great banking investments.  Always give my hard earned tax money to the government so they can in turn give it to others who know how to abuse the system and live on my dime while my family loses their health insurance due to impossible to afford monthly premiums and deductables and struggle to stay afloat, line the pockets of corrupt politicians and pay for luxurious lifestyles for themselves. Yep. Bitcoin is a total scam. 
@_date: 2018-04-22 17:56:00
On a serious note, aside from obvious legal ramifications I do believe paying taxes is important and that every person should be honest in paying their taxes regardless of personal opinions. It is absolutely disgusting though how our States especially but also Federal is abusing their power and the hard earned money of the people in many areas. 
@_date: 2019-05-18 17:58:54
At least they still love this country and it's citizens. This new neo nazi pseudo democratic left is scary
@_date: 2019-05-05 17:16:45
!remind me December 31 2021
@_date: 2019-05-16 13:05:19
I see. Yes. Very true. 99% of them are utter garbage or scams. Love ETH as well, I see it making a nice comeback. 
Also, OP. If you’re interested in learning about mining check out Badcoin. Affordable and fair for everyone to mine. Even on a 12 year old Mac cpu. Proof of Work which is what Bitcoin is. Would give you some hands on experience.
@_date: 2019-05-18 17:09:35
That is reality where I live.
@_date: 2019-05-18 16:01:08
100% true. Stay FAR away from Bitpay
@_date: 2019-05-18 16:06:00
That already is the mentality of every liberal politician and criminal to date.
 “Oh, you defended your home and hurt me when I was trying to murder your family and rob you blind?” 
“I’ll sue you and take everything you own and the judge will side with me.”
End of story. We are entering a lawless, evil and corrupt world thanks to the left. Great news if you’re a POS though.
@_date: 2018-12-02 19:40:06
Help me out here. Coming from a group that appears to take so much pride in “decentralization” and actual use case why in the world would you support ETFs and futures trading. You give XRP and Ripple so much crap yet you support this. Makes ZERO sense. Maybe I’m missing something here. 
@_date: 2018-12-10 16:48:14
For the people. LOL. I can’t laugh hard enough at that. Come visit California and see how well the people are doing. 
@_date: 2019-05-18 22:28:07
I feel very sad for you people. You have no idea what's about to happen and you're welcoming it with open arms and smiles.
