Do you need the money? Sell.   
Are you afraid it's gonna go down and you will be wishing you had sold? Sell  
If you don't care at all... HODL &amp; buy more.

As someone who has been through this with every single bank in the UK. I feel your pain! Banks do not have to give you any notice as this might count as tipping off.

Well there is always [

Just HODL mate. It will suck for a bit but you will get used to it.

We can't do credit since thats a different license all together. We do have some plans in the pipeline for merchants. Unfortunately we can't make the schemes accept crypto but what we can do is create our own POS with the option of crypto as a form of payment (ex. BtcPay, excellent service btw and we highly recommend people to use it). The biggest issue right now is the stores don't want to take the risk of hodling BTC due to the risk of price fluctuation, and they can't buy merchandise from their suppliers since they also don't accept crypto. We will offer the merchants an insta-fiat payout if they request it. It's just a small step to help adoption. We need to get people comfortable using crypto in every day life. Think of us like Windows 95. A simple interface that is easy to understand and use. Imagine if all of us still used DOS. I bet 99% of the people using computers now wouldn't be here. Same thing in crypto. We got to make things pretty and simple to bring in the people and create interest. That will lead into more revenue which in conjunction will bring bigger corporations and brains into the crypto world. That's how you create adoption.

 You are more than welcome to not use the Tap Token. We believe in freedom of choice. Our platform doesn't advertise or force you to buy Tap. That's why when you open the app the first thing you see is Bitcoin. We are trying to create adoption. A person who has barely heard what bitcoin is, is not gonna rush and buy tap. We want people to be comfortable buying Bitcoin and if they have an appetite for some risk they can diverse into other alts. As you can see on our website, we haven't focused at all on the tap token. Same on the whitepaper (A new one is coming out this week). Only a small section is dedicated on the tap token and its tokenomics. The rest is solely focused on the app and card.

Long time lurker on r/bitcoin. Yes, you are right  You do have to manually convert your crypto to fiat first. This is one of the guidelines we have to follow. We did have to apply for a crypto program which took close to 8 months to get approved. If it was a regular e-money wallet we would be up and running in 3 months instead of  2.5 years. There isn't such a thing as a crypto card. The schemes do not accept cryptocurrencies, they only settle in FIAT. This is our way to make crypto accessible to users. Feel free to call TPL anytime to confirm (Today is a bank holiday in Gibraltar so you might want to try tomorrow).
Here is also a PR release of our processor ([ . We are an approved program. As far as the Twitter goes, who doesn't have embarrassing things from their young ages. I've been on social media since forever which means lots of embarrassing things :D . If you see the dates of my posts you will come to a conclusion that I was making this posts from when I was 18. A lot wiser now. The bio on twitter is in reference of one of my favourite songs when I was a bit younger and stupider ([ You should check my Instagram bio... Recovering candy addict. A bit of humour in life can take you a long way.
Lastly about the car, she is sweet! It was paid with BTC back in May 2018 I know I should have Hodled but I cars have been my passion since I was a kid. I have been in crypto as a broker since 2014 on localbitcoins. That's were my wealth came from and I have invested everything into the making of tap. Glad to answer any of your questions. I'm a long time supporter of this community and that's why we will never support BCash, Faketoshi or any other fork of the Bitcoin network.
