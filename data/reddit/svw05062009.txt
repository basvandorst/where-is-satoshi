Whether you want it or not, Bitcoin is a foundation of cryptocurrency and governments are just looking for various reasons to slap taxes on it and get money off of it. Eventually crypto could very well undermine the banking sector once it's grown enough but who cares, we want a decentralized system!

I think you can start trading without verification but you need to deposit cryptocurrency. There are some solutions or maybe buy some other type of coins and then purchase bitcoin without verification.

Yes, it's interesting to see how digital money is "behaving" on the big "events". Should be more often so we can compare with fiat money.

Yes, but isn't that the data breach that the Bank or whoever is leaking privacy is guilty of? They need to improve data privacy protection anyway.

Anyway, it's good to see that crypto is being accepted by governments. I am not surprised that it's starting from northern Europe.

Yeah nice comparison, but still the speed is slow and not even close of reaching the number of fiat money transaction.

I expect 2020 to teach us a lesson of not concentrating on wealth, but the technology. I will be there hopefully to witness some new development, including nodes being sharded wisely and scalability solving. I think money earned in right hands will give us a society bettering itself.

Awesome! I think this is probably the most interesting month since the start of 2019.

Brace yourselves, October is coming \*earlier

It's a step to mass adoption but also collective regulation.
I would prefer some system with the highest level of decentralization taking over the world.

Have you considered greenbits? It's secure, easy to use. Only the set up is a little slower.
