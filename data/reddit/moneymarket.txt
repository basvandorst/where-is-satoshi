unable to log onto my account with coince.  I email them with no response.  I invested $20k for 20 days now and I haven't withdrawn any amount yet, all I did was reinvest put the money back in.  Now I try to withdraw my daily profit but they won't let me.  Watch for this scam everyone.  don't be stupid like me.
I also went on facebook today saw the 18% daily post on their page, I wrote in the comment section about be very careful about this company scam.  They block me from facebook page.
I work hard for my money, I put in all my life savings that I got and now they scam me.  How can people do this to other people???

Just give me 1 bitcoin and I am happy, I knew about bitcoin in 2015 but I can't afford to buy it.  I am 12 yrs old right now, my dream is to own 1 bitcoin in my life time.  1N1JbdJvm2CU5GjQBzsVkf7nf6dCMx6qnc
