There is no phishing or scam involved, just a new product that Bitmain said would be on sale August 30. They may have changed their mind on releasing the R4 for sale and have now put up a blank page at  where six hours ago a very polished website laid out all the specifications of the new home miner. A very nice miner at a good price. You can read more at bitcointalk thread at 
There is also a cached copy of the website they took down at

Thanks, I was looking for a list of the hardware wallets. Do you know when the keepkey will be for sale?

Can you post results please and do I have to tie bitcoin up for 30 days

Yes problem is not TREZOR itself but myTrezor.com web wallet can not handle the duplicate transactions and prevents user from spending bitcoin. Coinbase and Coinkite have fixed their wallets Trezor needs to fix theirs.

Any ETA from Trezor on when the web wallet will be fixed?
