Any plans for % based alerts? Example: Alert always when BTC moves up/down by 3%?

Litecoin is a fork of Bitcoin but I think what Charlie Lee is saying is if you fork off, call it something other than Litecoin * or Bitcoin * because you are intentionally trying to deceive users (therefore a scam). I don't think he is calling all forks scams.

I'm not sure exactly how but they do. I suspect they combine multiple transactions together to make it cheaper for them (single sender with multiple receivers). I think they make it free so you are more inclined to use their service and they recoup the loss with fees elsewhere (trading and market orders).

How far down do you think this current hiccup will go? I thought $6800 might be the bottom but its still trending down further.

Guys guys guys, where do I store my IOUs? I don’t think it’s safe to store them with the person who gave me them. Where’s the best place to to keep them? Maybe a safe? /s
Lol this post is great

The price seems tied to BCH. BTC is going up and BCH is going down. When BCH goes up BTC goes down.

Thinking about selling some now to buy back slightly lower during the night. Thoughts?
@_date: 2017-11-13 14:36:22
Just a minor dip.
@_date: 2017-11-13 01:32:16
Yes, when you buy on CoInbase with your credit card or ACH they will charge you a fee. If you buy with your credit card you can buy instantly. Also sending from CoInbase does have a high network/miner fee. You can circumvent the miner fee part by transferring your BTC to GDAX then sending it to whatever wallet you prefer for no network/miner fee. 
What I personally do is just use GDAX. I do the ACH transfer from my bank to GDAX as USD (not BTC) which has no fee. You will have to wait 5+ days for it to be available. Then I do a market limit (no fee vs a .25% for market order) then transfer it to my wallet of choice for no miner fee. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 00:42:37
I did the same thing but in the long run I think we’ll be okay. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 19:24:35
Wow this thread is a disaster: 
How desperate do you have to be to use all caps and that many exclamation points.

Is it over yet? Is it safe to stop buying? I’m running out of fiat!

Pin/paraphrase does nothing if your private key or words are printed/written on a sheet of paper in a lock box. If someone breaks in, the building burns down or someone sees your private key (bank employee, etc) then you are SOL. 
I thought about a scenario where you print the key and put it in an envelope with a wax seal to see if it gets tampered with but this is still susceptible to a thief breaking in to peoples lock boxes.

My first buy was at $4800 and it immediately went to $3600. Then it proceeded to go all the way over $7000. Just forget it's there for a few weeks and you will have a pleasant surprise soon. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:42:55
Did the calvary just arrive? Seems like we are going back up.  
@_date: 2017-11-13 14:46:46
Also, before you think BCH is better, look at how often they are mining blocks. It's like 1 every 2 hours. They are having long transaction times too. Look at some of the posts on complaining about it. Granted they have a hard fork today that is supposed to fix those issues.
@_date: 2017-11-13 22:47:24
Just ignore them because in a few weeks their alt coin will go back to $600. They aren’t going to replace Bitcoin. The idea is ridiculous. I’m fine with both coins co-existing. Choice is good. Don’t stoop to their level of attacking each either or trying to do smear campaigns. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 21:49:13
If you do this, I would recommend it on an encrypted USB key. If it gets stolen or someone at the bank sees your printed/written seed then your bitcoin is gone. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 13:20:44
No one can answer this. 
Some people say the price of BTC will go up because people will sell their B2X for more BTC causing the price to go up.
Some say the price will go down because people have moved their alt coins to BTC pre-fork to get double coins and will go back to alt coins post fork which will drive the price down.
Personally I am waiting until post fork to make any big buy-ins. I am just holding what I have and waiting to see what happens.

There is an autocorrect bug in 11.1 and was fixed in 11.1.1. The bug autocorrects “I” to some unrecognizable character. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:32:47
So you think people are transferring their BTC to an exchange to sell?
@_date: 2017-11-13 02:08:50
I don’t think you do that through GDAX. You can do that on Coinbase but GDAX you can only transfer the USD to your account. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:22:54
Unfortunately I think you are right. BCH price is rallying and BTC is declining.
@_date: 2017-11-14 00:10:59
I personally like and use the “HODL” app. Best of all it’s completely free. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 13:58:50
It's because of two reasons:
1) The miners switched to mining BCH over the weekend because it was more profitable. This caused a backlog in the mempool
2) To exacerbate point 1, people were spamming transactions with low fees to make it even worse.
It's going to take a a few days for the unconfirmed transactions to clear. If you you are not in a rush to send BTC just wait it out. If you are, you will just have to pay a high miner fee. There is not much that can be done at the moment.
 
@_date: 2017-11-13 01:18:38
There isn’t one for iOS and I’m pretty sure there isn’t one for Android either. However, their mobile site is really well done and I use that all the time. 
Also, if you have a Coinbase account, you essentially have a GDAX account already as they use the same credentials. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 14:54:03
Coinbase (bank) and GDAX (exchange) are the same company but different websites. If you have a Coinbase account you can sign up for a GDAX account very easily. Once on GDAX you can move your BTC from Coinbase to GDAX very easily/quickly. You can then send it to another BTC address completely free without any network/miner fee.
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:42:19
Well said.
@_date: 2017-11-13 01:13:54
Yeah I guess I’ll just hold. I should have waited to buy in a lot lower but in the long run I think I’m okay. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:55:10
Yeah I think I'll buy some in the ~$6700 price range in case this is the bottom and wait and see if it continues down before buying more.
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:33:33
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:43:55
Yeah i actually haven't bought in big yet. I bought small amounts around ~$5000 but looking to buy a lot more now. I'm just trying to see where the bottom is to buy. :) 
@_date: 2017-11-13 01:34:44
Coinbase won’t support BCH until January. You could use Bittrex or Bitfinex maybe. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 00:16:24
Where do you store your BIP38 passphrase. Keepass or something similar?
@_date: 2017-11-03 09:22:59
You are wrong. Leaving your bitcoins on an exchange is not safe. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 13:30:52
If it's in your wallet you will need to wait until your wallet updates (if it does at all) to support B2X or import your private key into a wallet that supports B2X. If you want to sell/trade your B2X quickly after the fork then moving it to GDAX is likely your best option.
@_date: 2017-11-13 21:06:39

@_date: 2017-11-11 20:24:56
I could be wrong but I just don’t see it going below 6000. I think it has too much resistance to go to 5800. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 16:48:20
It is a problem but in 3 hours and 28 min BTC will be more profitable to mine than BCH and the miners will slowly come back.
@_date: 2017-11-10 22:57:23

@_date: 2017-11-13 14:33:52
It is actively being worked on. Segwit lowered fees significantly but adoption hasn't been quick. Nothing I say can make his transcation go through any quicker right now other than paying a higher fee to jump ahead in the queue. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 15:34:25
Right, so it averages out over all of your purchases. That's why it's called dollar cost average...
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:14:38
A lot of exchanges don't charge you the network/miner fee to send BTC from the exchange. I know for sure GDAX and Gemini don't charge you.
@_date: 2017-11-12 17:04:48
Gemini will let you do the ACH transfer and buy BTC on the same day. You can't move the BTC out until the transfer officially goes through though.
@_date: 2017-11-13 14:31:43
Move it from Coinbase to GDAX and send your BTC using GDAX. There will be no miner/network fee.
GDAX has low or no fees.
@_date: 2017-11-13 16:30:56
I started out testing the waters by doing $50 every paycheck. I went all in this weekend. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 17:08:47
I am in the same boat as you. I think I am going to wait it out and see what happens with the fork. I may get screwed and it may go over $10k but I am not going to chance it. I have my fiat on the Exchange waiting for the dip.
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:46:07
That's not entirely true. People store their money as gold but you can't go and buy groceries with a bag of gold.
@_date: 2017-11-13 01:11:42
Since you are set up on Coinbase now, I would get setup on GDAX. It’s essentially the same company but different websites. Coinbase is more like a bank and GDAX is the exchange. With GDAX you can do ACH transfers from your bank with no fees then do market limits for no fees (basically buying BTC for your set price). Lastly you can also transfer your BTC to a hardware, software or paper wallet with no miner fee. With Coinbase your fees are a lot higher because it’s a bank.

I can tell you as someone who has been to tech conferences before, the people running these booths are not technically minded or engineers. They are all sales/marketing people. I'm sure there are some company booths whose engineers got roped into having to be at the booth but those are the few. Most companies just try to put a pretty face behind the booth.
Personally I thought the guy who said "decentralized ledger" was pretty spot on while also keeping his answer short/simple.
@_date: 2017-10-23 14:15:25
I really like Bread for the interface but what kills it for me is the network fees. I have seen $4+ for a single transaction before even when selecting the "Economy" option. There needs to be a third option for the absolute lowest fee but also isn't going to take the transaction a week to go through (12-24 hours would be fine with me).
With that said, there has to be another iOS wallet that handles this better?
@_date: 2017-10-23 13:36:40
Definitely do this and let me know when you are going to be vacationing at the beach and what beach you are going to.
@_date: 2018-02-02 22:41:44
I guess you’re right about the centralized/decentralized blockchain. I guess a better description would have been “distributed ledger” in simplistic terms.
@_date: 2017-10-18 14:16:48
I don’t know the specifics of it. I just know people are buying BTC right now hoping to have double coins when the fork happens. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 14:55:53
That is my understanding as well. If you are ever in a scenario where you can't re-download Bread from the App Store there may not be a way to restore your wallet.

If you choose BIP39 in the options and specify m/0' in derivation path then it works in Electrum!
@_date: 2017-10-23 14:57:14
Has anyone used Mycelium on iOS? I heard good things about it on Android but unfortunately the reviews are pretty mixed on iOS. The interface on Bread seems much better to me but how is Mycelium functionality wise?
@_date: 2017-10-23 17:57:11
I just tried to import my Bread seed into Electrum and it showed a 0 balance even when I chose BIP39. I'm not sure it is possible with Electrum. I did not try Multibit.
Edit: If you choose BIP39 in the options and specify m/0' in derivation path then it works in Electrum!

Is the short always an open ended time frame or do you set the time when your borrow?
In OPs demo account example, could he theoretically wait (potentially forever) for the price to fall again?
@_date: 2017-10-20 15:02:04
I personally wouldn't sell right now but I'm definitely not buying either. Once there is another healthy drop then I'll buy more.
Just curious and I mean no disrespect, where are you hoping to buy back in at? I'm doubtful we will see sub $5,000 again.

Shh! Let it drop so I can buy more. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 14:46:20
Unfortunately it varies depending on (I assume) the number of network transactions currently happening. Mine showed 13 cents earlier today which is reasonable. On average I usually see 30-40 cents which I still think is too high. More options or a way to just set a custom fee (by enabling it under advanced settings) would be best.
