Well more like a 9 year old knocking down a very annoying baby :p

Yes (I'm using it right now) It was wiped while being repaired. I don't think there's any hope.
@_date: 2017-11-15 12:19:49
Happened to me too. I agree this is outrageous but I'm sure you can get everything out if you wait a bit :) Relax
@_date: 2017-11-15 12:11:14
I couldn't either this morning, but it seems to work now.
@_date: 2017-11-01 16:16:22
That sounds like you broke up ��

Anything that "guaranteens" returns is a scam.
@_date: 2017-11-28 12:52:24
And beyond!

Last may i bought 0.05 bitcoins. I was new and green and knew nothing about wallet security so when i next month broke my phone, all was lost :( Sometimes i regret that because of me, some bitcoin was lost for everyone forever :(

Neatly in the drawer. I use them to eat sometimes.

Treat the invested money as "lost". If you can't afford to lose that money, then you shouldn't invest. Otherwise welcome aboard :)
@_date: 2017-10-20 14:27:43
It's not just me then $_$
@_date: 2017-09-14 14:23:38
Me too
@_date: 2017-10-20 14:23:51
Suddenly my blockfolio shows that i have 12 000 BILLION (i wish that were true)
@_date: 2017-10-20 15:21:39
I think it's still gonna correct at some point
@_date: 2017-10-20 14:31:25
I would have 12 000 billion :p
@_date: 2017-10-18 18:11:00
I'm here and I HODL! (Though sometimes I'm just as scared as the next person ;_;)
Edit: Would NEVER panic-sell! I'm onboard to the sweet/bitter end.
@_date: 2017-10-13 16:17:49
I like it! But it's a bit dark. Can you make the colors brighter? :) is this gonna be on a website or something?
@_date: 2017-10-20 19:46:23
I can withdraw quite well
@_date: 2017-10-20 15:34:03
Me too. I hate it.
@_date: 2017-10-20 15:20:20
Could i just buy some bitcoins and sell them in zimbabwe and profit? :D
@_date: 2018-07-28 18:11:01
Right now bitcoin inflates faster than most fiat. However after next halvening it will be about the same rate and the inflation only gets smaller after that.
@_date: 2017-10-20 14:34:59
Is this happening because kraken api went nuts?
