Suppose a user double spends his bitcoins, [which is possible as mentioned here]( so how do you counter this? What form of security and security to whom are you talking about?

So Bitcoin is not *all anonymous* as it says it is? Then why not just add a centralised authority and remove all the [double spending attacks]( which are possible without it?

What does pseudonymous even mean? Either you can match me with my address or you cannot. Either you can know my other transactions or you cannot. If i find one way you can, the protocol is not anonymous.

But i'm not talking about breaking into a wallet or anything. When i create new addresses, i do it because i don't want other user(s) to know my other sources of transactions. But when multiple address are shown up in one transaction, that means *ALL* of those addresses are of the same user, which reveals the other transactions carried out by me. **THAT** breaks anonymity. Doesn't it?

Is multisig explained in detail somewhere, i want to take a look at it. Also, is it possible to implement it in bitcoin?

If it is pseudonymous, then please answer [this]( \^_^

Darkcoin transactions seem similar to me. [Check this out]( There are more than 1 address sending some darkcoins to an address. Now we can be sure that all of those addresses belong to same user and, thus, recognise his other transactions.

Firstly, in research, every problem is a problem, be it a small or big deal of problem. Little drops make mighty oceans.
Secondly, the double spending attack, basically, is not paying for a service. the attack(as mentioned in link) states that we send 1 transaction through wallet and the same transaction to own wallet directly through tcp. If the first transaction is accepted in chain, we fail but don't lose anything. But if latter is accepted, we get services for free, which means we can send the same coins to someone else for some other service. Thus, double spending the same coin.
