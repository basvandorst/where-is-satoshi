Wow, it shows how random the puzzle could be. After so many ''clues'' given and a week of thinking about it, I still have no solid theory to start and nothing makes sense yet.. I'm having a hard time to think that it's just a bruteforce game or we need to reverse engineer the image... Starting to think that the solution is either way over my head or just make zero sense.

It is the hard part! I think the puzzle will be solve in a couple of hours, I may give a clue in a day if I underestimated the difficulty!

Congrats! That was fast! I'm glad you loved it! I'll do more of thoses!

the number 1 in white (close to ''try'') shows the same orientation, size font  and color of the word ''one'' just above it... All those unique scattered numbers may gives clue to which size and direction words we are looking for at each place(think in pairs)... with the +1 clue, it could point to the 2nd word of the seed as ''one'' while 0 could be showing us the first word... Unique numbers scattered around goes from 0 to 12 (except 24 and 25), the extra one could have simply been the passphrase...

The number of possibilities for the 9th and 11th word make my theory difficult to verify or discard. Here some valids checksum obtained from bruteforcing my theories so far:
attack entire wait actual race provide place gold rely way also try
antique wait entire place provide gold rely actual way race also try
play risk ability help stay entire just define race gold attack try
play risk gold ability help stay entire just define race attack try
play risk stay race entire define ability try attack just help gold
trust open online must attack try just almost easily code early air
one know reveal now run power else place online work early tail
verify one since also now run power else place just work early
verify one since reveal now size power pair place online work early
verify one since reveal now size work pair place online power credit
next one now level know run power else place just work early
time one now level know run power else place just work credit
verify one now level know run power else place just work access
need one now level know run power else place just work credit
need one now reveal know valid power gold place just work credit
next one know reveal now run power else place satisfy work credit
next one know reveal now run power else place just work early
next one know reveal now run power else place online work credit
next one know reveal now run power else place want work early
next one know reveal now run power else place provide work solve

In the meantimes I made mine ;-) GL

''Size and direction pairing theory'' possible seed list:
Word (+1)
Word 0: next time verify need
Word 1: one
Word 2: now level reveal know
Word 3: now level reveal know
Word 4: now level reveal know
Word 5: run valid size
Word 6: power work
Word 7: gold else save pair
Word 8: place
Word 9: just online want satisfy stock tape either vote provide tail
Word 10: power work
Word 11: early modify credit gap agree access race used special solve rather
Word 12(passphrase?): May have been removed (one less step)
@_date: 2018-05-22 03:52:54
Same puzzle, one less step... Passphrase could have been removed...
@_date: 2018-05-28 11:37:06
Np! mine is solved guys! GG
@_date: 2018-05-22 17:02:24
I know but Im starting from the number 0, so 11 would represent the 12th word and 12 the passphrase (13th word)...
@_date: 2018-05-28 15:01:56
yes! pls show me some of the sickest!

I like puzzles where you pick up on a lead quickly, but gradualy gets more challenging with more and more layers...

I made this puzzle partly for you guys and also for me. The reasons for me were experimentals, it was my first crypto ''puzzle'' ever. It was very basic and quickly made, I got to say I was eager to publish it... What I'm taking back from this experiment:
To do an announcement first (maybe 2 hours in advance or something like that) to give the time of release and more people a chance to join in....
Sudokus are great to hide a full private key with only a part of it, and are easily solvables. However keeping the solution ''as is'' to generate entropy may or may not be a very secure way to generate a wallet. (after checking on Google, there would be 6,670,903,752,021,072,936,960 different sudokus on a 9x9 grid, nice!!)
Trying to find more fun twists to have a lenghty puzzle, but keeping it relatively simple and engaging to limit frustration.
Seeing the time it took u/agurodriguez to solve it and also the time it took to detect the sudoku by u/kallebo1337, I'll try to make the next puzzle a little more sturdy. I can give you the first clue already: It's NOT a sudoku :-)
Any feedback is appreciated!
