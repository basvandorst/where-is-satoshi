Do you work for this company? If so can I ask some questions?
@_date: 2019-07-20 22:09:44
Do you have any plans to add a feature where you can transfer the spare change round ups to a different bank that you have? 
EX: I spend 1.50 from account A. .50 cents gets cent to account B. Both A and B are my accounts. 
There isn't any product on the market that lets you do this.
@_date: 2019-07-20 22:01:15
Keep in mind, they do charge a .99 cent monthly fee. It really isn't disclosed anywhere but the TOS
