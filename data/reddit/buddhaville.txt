I am wondering if Coinbase is going to let all the 14,000 know, or not
@_date: 2018-09-05 13:58:17
grats on your first BTC's!
@_date: 2018-09-01 00:53:45
fyi, i get google warning when visiting coveredbycrypto.com
maybe malware'd site?
@_date: 2018-08-15 11:53:05
I'm pretty sure [Roger Ver]( owns [Calvin Ayre]( period.
@_date: 2018-08-18 19:39:23
sickens me that Ver is getting away with that
@_date: 2018-05-06 12:53:53
Is Roger becoming a maniac attention whore? I think this is what he is transforming into.
@_date: 2018-05-08 02:39:33
Bill Gates did not just intentionally make himself look like a dumbass, he's gotta be up to something imo. And awesome for Winklevoss to post that. badass

BCH is lol, won't touch it
@_date: 2018-05-05 06:26:07

I wonder how much they (she) has spent trying to "keep up with the jones'" and she bout to rage on him for small investing in Bitcoin.
Their problem wasnt bitcoin, it was most likely their lifestyle based on spending shit they dont have.
@_date: 2019-11-27 21:05:23
Yup, [Trezor]( &amp; [Ledger]( are the best.
@_date: 2019-11-27 22:06:35
will check it out , thanks for suggestion
@_date: 2018-06-18 05:25:23
they are not deleting crime accounts, they are deleting regular users accounts who have submitted every piece of information Coinbase has ever required
@_date: 2019-08-24 07:05:07
unbelievable how hard they're trying to scam people. This is jailbird activities from team BCH
@_date: 2019-08-23 14:53:27
Unbelievable scam Roger was going for. This alone is enough to call Roger a scammer/fraud/liar/pos for a lifetime.
Really scummy thing to pull.
@_date: 2019-08-20 02:31:24
so you believe the garbage they're spewing?
@_date: 2019-10-03 23:39:02
yes, remember [Coinbase terminates accts]( for no reason (read middle page)
@_date: 2019-10-03 23:36:52
Ok because just last week they said this: "For the record, Gemini's fees are IDENTICAL to Coinbase's fees"
@_date: 2019-10-05 16:10:28
juta14x, you do understand that if this same mistake is not exposed from 1000's of other users within a few days, means that your problem is isolated, and means that logically-thinking is an error on your end. Can you agree with this?
@_date: 2018-06-27 09:49:40
fyi, you can still buy gyft cards with BTC for Delta, Southwest Air, &amp; American Airlines 
@_date: 2018-06-30 13:03:52
was just gonna say that.... awesome place!
@_date: 2019-06-28 13:10:16
the Bitcoinmeister!!! Love this guys enthusiasm! Good dude!
@_date: 2019-08-03 19:34:21
Crypto mofos brought big brains for 2019!!! Thanks for waking up!!! Rock on BTC!!!
@_date: 2019-02-08 19:28:58
thanks man :)
@_date: 2019-02-08 19:30:19
ikr, have you seen their subreddit? they're in desperation mode 
@_date: 2019-02-08 19:18:23
Noticed this bs recently too.
- Blockchain com added confusion and shameless bch attention, 
- Blockstream info has data limitations
... anyone know something better ? 
@_date: 2019-02-08 19:34:25
[Coinbase account terminated](
[Gab personal acct]( 
[Wikileaks acct closed](
@_date: 2019-02-08 11:29:44
their entire subreddit is dedicated to deceive newcomers and slander Bitcoin. Sad &amp; pathetic over there for sure.
@_date: 2019-02-08 19:25:43
waste of time vid
@_date: 2019-04-13 05:02:14
he's a con artist, not Satoshi, and an arrogant POS.
@_date: 2018-03-30 14:48:50
ouch. Sad series of events :(
@_date: 2018-03-12 09:29:48
cool site man, i found it quite useful :) thanks
@_date: 2018-11-17 20:12:49
read through that site and you'll see the site owner is a scammer
@_date: 2018-07-13 23:20:43
yeaaa haha
@_date: 2019-09-18 16:35:23
Great job to correct them. BTC is one and only Bitcoin.
Anyone else advertising other shit is attempting to fraud you. (ie: careful for BCH/BSV, there are tons of these scammers)
@_date: 2018-04-05 19:21:44
ya it is, probably the most deceptive website on the net
@_date: 2018-04-28 12:44:27
I wish Roger would stop his scam. My bro bought Bcash , he said he wanted to buy bitcoin, and he ended up with BCH :( he's pissed. And it sickens me
@_date: 2018-04-10 15:38:36
well, it's as deceptive as anything can be
is like having a website "hot latina girls" when you only see asian bbw's. 
@_date: 2019-05-09 14:03:33
[ \- LOL
@_date: 2019-05-26 11:35:48
Saifedean, Max, Andreas (he has already twice right?), Anthony too, they're all great great mofos! Would love to eventually see them all on Joe Rogan
@_date: 2019-05-26 11:42:58
i'd be tailgating that! LOL
@_date: 2018-12-30 21:02:14
I would never consider getting involved with something Roger Ver is a partner with, like FuzeX.
