Sorry, I must have been confused by the number of question marks.
@_date: 2014-02-25 18:14:15
You're just now learning this? In 2014?
@_date: 2018-02-02 23:58:37
Except for the fact that you give ALL your CC info out to buy something and TRUST them not to use your info. 
@_date: 2013-11-09 06:24:05
Do you understand what they're trying to do? No.
@_date: 2013-12-03 00:18:20
Yes! Children are naturally organic!
@_date: 2013-12-07 20:04:49
r/Bitcoin wants regulation? 
@_date: 2013-11-17 18:19:43
Checkmate...  Uh, bitcoin naysayers. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 19:09:15
Too late. Might still be a Monday morning surge though. 
@_date: 2013-11-21 19:15:46
What about Bitcoin ATM cameras?
@_date: 2013-11-18 16:41:33
Ladies and gentleman, Mr. Randy Watson!

Right, if you only spend 25-30k a year then you don't really need multi-millions in the bank. That 800k he's got sitting in index funds gives him plenty to live on for a long long time.
@_date: 2013-11-22 18:08:28
I sold at ~705.
@_date: 2013-11-09 07:45:06
seems like a smart guy
@_date: 2013-11-10 14:14:59
Buying one or just a down payment lol
@_date: 2013-11-06 15:19:02
Should've looked at your transaction history before selling again. 
@_date: 2013-09-06 04:25:38
$1000 by tomorrow morning.
@_date: 2013-11-18 07:33:53
We love to hate 'em!
@_date: 2013-11-10 14:54:23
Ahh I see, nice!
@_date: 2013-11-19 04:35:06
BREAM! Get the money.
@_date: 2013-11-18 07:27:34
$1.33 USD!
@_date: 2013-12-04 04:58:49
I think it's unnecessary. It's kinda cool that 1 bitcoin is a big deal now. And small numbers like 5000 Btc is an impressive amount of money. We can definitely deal in mBtc but the ticker should stay Btc. 
@_date: 2013-11-15 21:55:57
You ONLY watch Fox News? Really?
@_date: 2013-11-01 21:35:47
There's also commas...
@_date: 2013-11-12 18:59:42
I think its obvious public speaking is not their forte, but they gave good answers to all the questions. Try listening to Warren Buffet speak, he too is kinda odd.
@_date: 2013-09-12 03:00:25
Seems to be going up now at the end of the day. Its up to 127.
@_date: 2013-09-06 04:30:49
Ok but does that mean $1000 by October?
@_date: 2013-09-06 03:12:14
What is the "grey candle" supposed to signify?
@_date: 2013-10-20 01:50:34
I'm interested 
@_date: 2013-11-06 05:57:45
Yeah maybe cycle down to 240, hang out in the 250s for a while and then boom more media coverage and general good bitcoin news and we're at 320
@_date: 2013-11-10 14:13:35
Just a down payment?? I thought you paid cash for it. That would've been much more impressive. 
@_date: 2013-11-16 11:18:11
Its all about the soft entry.
@_date: 2013-11-22 18:23:15
That's good advice.
@_date: 2013-11-15 19:36:48
Coinbase has been excellent for me too. Even the rejected iphone app is still working perfectly. 
@_date: 2013-10-31 02:01:30
Eh, it was funny when grandma said it. 
@_date: 2013-11-22 18:26:01
Thanks man
@_date: 2013-09-10 23:58:27
What the hell man?
@_date: 2013-11-08 19:06:54
But.... its shiny?
@_date: 2013-11-08 16:26:01
I liked it too.
@_date: 2013-11-05 19:15:25
Which would not be the same as printing money.
@_date: 2013-11-14 01:23:33
ZeroBlock is also a really well designed bitcoin ticker app. Nice because it shows the next difficulty, market cap and a few other things on the front page. Slide left to see the candlesticks and right to see news. Sometimes I read articles from reddit and try to comment forgetting that I'm not actually in reddit. 
iBitcoin is probably best for all the hardcore information. You can customize with practically all the important exchanges. It's designed like the old iOS stocks app. 
And btcReport is actually what I look at most throughout the day. Mostly because it can track the Coinbase rate and once I input a number in the conversion calculator it remembers it so I can leave it at the amount I have. I also like the black on white interface.
