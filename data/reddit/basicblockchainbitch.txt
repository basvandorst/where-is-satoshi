I didn’t force myself into any conversation. We are talking about Laura, a female figure in the blockchain community. I directly related to this post as it reminded me of experiences I have had as a woman in the industry, where you constantly have to prove yourself and are held to higher standards. As a woman in tech you’re much more likely to get written off or not taken seriously. You get jumped on and criticized for things that men in your field can easily get away with or do without anyone noticing. 
I never even said the word oppressed. I’m just pointing out that Laura does a great job with her interviews, and while she may or may not “shill” I have never noticed. She conducts herself in a way that is much more professional and legitimate than any other member of the blockchain/crypto press I have encountered. 
Again, this industry is 100% pay to play. Let’s give people credit when they provide real value to the community, which Laura does. She’s far from the worst out there, but as a woman she’ll of course be the first to get called out. 
What exactly do you want me to “step back and listen” to other than a bunch of guys shitting on her?

Laura does good interviews. Her recent one with CZ was excellent. She pushed back hard and made great points. I’m not a religious listener or anything but give her some credit. This whole damn industry is pay for play and I really don’t think she’s the worst of it, or even close. But of course people love to hold women in male dominated fields to much higher standards and are always ready to shit on them.

Lol as a female blockchain CEO don’t even get me started. If you want to pretend there isn’t a real bias / different standards for women then you’re either uninformed or delusional. Maybe try talking to a woman in the industry and hear her take, you may be surprised.
Laura as an example here has done nothing that every other media outlet hasn’t done. She also provides real value and I learn a lot whenever I listen to her show.

Uh but it actually happened so ��‍♀️ maybe kkw isn’t the type to invest in tech stocks and Kanye wanted to give her something he believed would have lasting value and introduce her to new opportunities.

Thank you for being a lone voice of reason ��
