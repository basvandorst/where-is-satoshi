I really, really hope this is a joke. Nobody is this stupid.

Been following bitcoin for a couple of years now and I have 0 sympathy for anyone here today who has lost a lot of money. You can all trick yourselves into believing you were in it for "the long run" and "this is the future" when in reality all it is and ever will be was a means to buy stuff anonymously online (drugs etc.).
Next time just put in what you want to buy into your wallet and use it immediately, the time frame to be using bitcoin as an investment opportunity is long gone.

Good for general exposure but these guys got hacked in 2017.  
*The company says the attacker only pilfered user personal information, such as emails, hashed passwords, bank account numbers (IBANs), telephone numbers, and home addresses.* 
You don't want to be trusting these guys

So basically, unless Akon is a shill we should expect him to be in an "accident" sometime soon?

Any alternatives to this site? Getting real bored of rarely being able to buy Bitcoins and checking them.
I have only been using it for about 2 weeks now.
