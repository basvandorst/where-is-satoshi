Sorry to be blunt. You're shit out of luck man.

Not really a "newbie" personally, I've been using bitcoin for many years buying stuff on deep web marketplaces, but like you, I always wrote it off and never had much thought that prices would skyrocket.
These days I'm heavily invested because the truth is, I can see my investment in 2017 (~$50k between btc and litecoin) making me millions of dollars in the future (however long that may be).
So for me it's a lazy get rich quick scheme and that's the truth. I suspect a huge amount of people investing in 2017 are in the same position.

You seem like you're full of yourself with the way you talk to your family.

What correction? A couple hundred dollar drop is not a correction, it's volatility.

All you do is sit on reddit and post meme's ;) Must be doing well for yourself

Except for the fact that cryptocurrency doesn't operate in that way. You can always buy some bitcoin, however high the price may be...

It's pretty obvious what these people are doing.
1) Dump coins
2) Spread FUD to cause panic and crash the price
3) Re-buy after a small "crash" 
4) ??? 
5) Profit
People who fail to realise this shouldn't be investing money because ultimately they will lose.

I confidently believe all the people who live by the HODL meme have such a small amount invested because they can't afford to put much in. 
Anyone with tens of thousands invested would be silly to not sell during big drops like the china one recently. 
Soon as that news came out I sold all mine at $5650 AUD and just recently rebought at $4000 AUD
And I'm talking ~$50k investment

Funny thing is, he will probably end up investing in it at one point too.

80% of my ~$50k portfolio is into LTC at the moment

Simple answer from me, no.
Slightly more broad answer, a $20k investment into LTC right now will net you more profits when it hits it's old ATH. 100% gains nearly.
