If you're invested, then of course you're currently happy.
But there's more examples of exponential growth being a problem than a good start

Welp, I submitted a more selfish one.
I work in a disadvantaged rural school school in Australia. Our kids limit of technology and stem exposure is a few PC labs and a couple Lego robots kits.
We've applied twice for a grant supposed to supply up to $4million to exactly our situation in buckets up to $50k for laser cutters and maker spaces, and been knocked back each time.
So I applied and asked for $100k. We could by a massively useful laser cutter, a few 3d printers, maybe even a small educational milling machine. This is tech that otherwise doesn't exist in 300 miles for our kids.
I realise in terms of total impact, eff, Wikipedia, and lots of others could likely get much more impact straight up, but this would make a massive amount of difference to a few hundred students every year for potentially decades.
Shrugs. I've submitted and op is the decision holder.
Disadvantaged in the respect that 40% of our students have no employed members of their households, 42% are indigenous, 31% are below "the poverty line" 23% live in government housing et cetera. And then we're a town 400kms away from major cities.

First, got a pic?
Second, logarithmic means exponential
 If a logarithmic graph puts it rushing any more than a straight line, it's exponential.

They're not great points...
"The price is being blown out of proportion, when it starts to crash, don't sell"
There's trade and buy orders for upwards of $3mil. That's not Joe's and Jane's, that's corporate involvement.

Hensaodnitnrose exponentially. You said it's not a big rise if you look at logarithmic scale.
If it's going upwards on a log scale, it's exponential.
Best site for a log scale on Bitcoin? First three I tried don't have one.
Edit, found one, and found a pic from June, ironically with comments saying they think itll hit 10k by end of year then crash.
It's rising exponentially.
@_date: 2017-12-02 21:18:51
Your comment was ambiguous. He said it was exponential and it seemed you were rebutting.
Exponential growth is a bad sign.

Almost textbook ponzi scheme. There's just not one dude in the middle running it all.

Stupid argument. Nobody who bet on Patriots lost this year either.

If it's not a stupid decision, if it's not gambling, then you SHOULD mortgage your house. And you should be encouraging anyone you care about to do the same.
But you know it's not.

Was it absolutely, positively, guaranteed to go up?
Absolutely ZERO chance of going down?

Hasn't been debunked at all.
Every person who invested in property for 40 years and held it made tonnes of cash too. Right up until they suddenly, massively, didn't.
Bitcoin as an investment isn't special. It's value if anything is more volatile and crazy as there isn't anything of actual tangible backing behind it. The only reason it doesn't tank is because more people are buying in.
The current value is nothing more than a Ponzi or Amway bubble.
You keep saying last events like they affect the future. You're provably wrong in the short term and likely to be even more wrong at some point in the future.
@_date: 2017-09-02 10:41:03
You keep using the word risk, then saying it's not gambling.

I'm not trying to define squat.


Uh... Okay. Let's just pretend for a moment that is a fact. There's no evidence it won't either. It's essentially a currency at this point. Those go up and down all the time. Sometimes a little sometimes a lot. When they're young they are super volatile and often do crash though. So there's some evidence against your claim.
Like, your claim of if you bought and held coins you're in front" is probably wrong in a lot of cases. Shit went from above $3000 each to under $2000 each within the last two months alone. That is the antithesis of a stable investment.


Ah, so its a Ponzi scheme? Shit only gets more valuable while more people are buying in?
Once people slow down buying in, a bunch of people are going to cut and run and leave everyone high and dry.
If all the majority of people buying Bitcoin are doing it as an investment, then it's currently in exactly what makes a bubble. People riding the ride up in order to rich out as late as they're brave enough to hold on for, before sudden catastrophe. People have used EXACTLY your arguments about property in almost every western country for the last thirty years. "Financial crisis" ring a bell?

You have this completely arse backwards. It's easy to look from NOW at the past and say "well, that was obvious!". That's what you're doing.
That doesn't meant it wasn't risky or idiotic.
It was. Both. It also paid off. That was fortunate, but doesn't change the stupid risk at the time.
If it was an easily calculable risk, why didn't millions more people do it?
Now answer my questions in the last post
@_date: 2017-09-02 10:43:16
Because mortgaging your house to bet on the patriots IS idiotic and IS gambling. Even if "everyone who bet on them won" 
Even if they were favourites. Even if you had inside information.
@_date: 2017-09-02 09:17:42


Yes you can.


Exactly. This is proof that this was a risky, stupid, gambling move.


Doesn't mean it wasn't gambling.


And it was exactly as idiotic when this guy did it.
