@_date: 2018-01-21 21:57:53
They were being hurt with transactions not going through, or taking too long and then the conversion rate changes, or people opening support tickets about the fees.
@_date: 2018-01-07 23:18:47
They don’t hold the keys.
They’re simply developers. Anyone can fork and make a client that increases the block size. 
Bitcoin is an open source project, and that’s the beauty of open source.
We just need someone to do it, and for it to get consensus (which I believe it would considering the shift of sentiment due to high fees over the past 6 or so months).
@_date: 2018-01-07 23:11:28
Yeah we can! Just need someone to make a client to do that (which shouldn’t be hard for someone that can code).
**The Core developers don’t hold any authoritative position. We, the community, are what defines consensus. If a majority of the community wants something, then we can make it happen!**
@_date: 2018-01-07 23:16:14
Yep, this is only an issue because of the situation the Core Developers have created.
@_date: 2018-01-08 09:10:14
Whatever clients jointly have consensus are considered "Bitcoin".
Obviously that includes Bitcoin Core, but to say Bitcoin Core *is* Bitcoin means you're ignoring all the other compatible clients/wallets that people are currently using.
It's not *impossible* for a different client to enter the mix, gain a majority, and then hard fork so that Core is no longer compatible. It would be difficult, yes. But not impossible.

Video games were a majority of my Bitcoin purchases. It’s sad that both Humble and Steam have stopped accepting it. 
:/ 
Can’t blame either of them though...
@_date: 2018-01-09 13:49:22
Yep! Ignore Steam, Microsoft, and others dropping it.
All that matters for adoption is this one, independently franchised location accepting it! 
(I mean yeah, it’s good that they accept it, but we’re still losing merchants faster than we’re gaining them)
@_date: 2018-01-21 12:15:54
Does HumbleBundle even accept Bitcoin anymore?
I swear, every time I’ve wanted to purchase a bundle with it, Bitcoin payments were “disabled”. 
The most recent time I checked, I just didn’t see the option.
@_date: 2018-01-07 23:35:38


These merchants have already been burned once on something that was initially considered a risk.
Why would they risk being burned a *second* time by re-implementing it?
If anything they’ll wait a *long* time until it’s “mature” enough for it to be less of a risk.
If enough merchants start thinking like that, then you have the problem where everyone is waiting for everyone else to jump in before they do. 
“I’ll do X if you do it first!”  
“Nu-uh! You do it first!  
“No you!”
ad infinitum.

Speaking of which, are people still using NiceHash after the hack (or did they shut down)? I remember they were pretty darn popular.
Or have most people switched to somewhere else?
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:29:29
You would need an individual to release a 2Mb client that activates after a safe period of time.
I think the whole problem with the recent fork attempts is that they’re backed by groups or corporations with their own hidden motives. People are wary of supporting them because they don’t know their intentions.
If some no name individual were to do it and be like “here you go, goodbye now”, it might have a chance.

What about the majority of people that aren’t using Segwit?
Is Valve supposed to just tell them “you’re using it wrong”?
Or are you suggesting a payment processor that *only* accepts Segwit transactions? Does one even exist?
Adding credit still doesn’t solve the problem of high fees and volatility. They will still get users saying “I added $100 worth of Bitcoin, why did I only get $80 in my wallet?”
You’re forgetting that VPN and Hosting users are probably more tech savvy than the average Steam user. Maybe that’s why it works for them, and won’t for Valve.
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:40:46
Segwit wouldn’t have helped Steam since they were using Bitpay, and most likely cashing out instantly.
The senders (users) are the ones paying fees, not Bitpay, and not Steam
For Steam, it was the influx of tickets and refunds that was hurting them.
They also said it **topped out** at $20. Not that it is, and forever will be $20.
@_date: 2017-12-23 05:04:55
What has Core delivered in the past year?
If anything they caused the community to split further, which just *delayed* Segwit.
We’ve been hearing “LN Soon” for the past year...
Fees continue to rise, yet according to GMax that’s [a cause for celebration????]( 
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:28:08
I repeat, what is *Valve* supposed to do in this situation? Tell their users that they’re using Bitcoin wrong?
Most companies/groups care about their image, and want to minimize the number of support issues they receive.
If it is in a merchants best interest to stop accepting a payment method, then there is something wrong with that payment method.

“My stove is on fire, but the fire department will be here **eventually**. Why bother using a fire extinguisher?”

Yeah, not "allow anyone in the world to send each other money, maybe in a day or two if they pay a high enough fee".
How are the "unbanked" going to afford $30 fees when they make $30 a week?
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:05:45
The whole “we will continue to monitor the situation” is just standard with these kinds of things. Why would they re-implement it if they’ve been burned once before?
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:41:57
That’s exactly what they did, since they said right in the announcement 


@_date: 2017-12-06 23:14:41
It’s more like “why prevent the drapes, the cupboards, and the next room catching fire when the fire department is 5 minutes away!”
@_date: 2017-12-27 07:34:15
No longer instant due to full blocks, no longer viable for the unbanked due to fees.
The only "pleasant" thing to discuss is the price (well, most of the time).
The community has really changed for the worst in the past year or so. I remember it being a lot different when I first got started in Bitcoin.
Edit: Personally, I'm trying to ignore crypto more than usual over the holidays. Spending more time with friends and family rather than arguing online or worrying about the price. Hope you are enjoying the holidays as well!
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:08:41
But that’s what it is?
This announcement just further proves that it can’t be used as a currency.
Videogames aren’t “coffee”. Many cost anywhere from $60-$100.
If fees are too costly for $60-$100 transactions, then what is it good for?

I refuse to give a Microsoft even a single Satoshi.
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:53:55
It **can’t**. Which is why so many are against these ridiculous fees, and are for bigger blocks.
Take Canada for example.
We have a national interbank network that doesn’t charge the end user **anything** to use it. Works between all national banks, has something like 90%+ merchant adoption rate.
We have the standard tap/contactless payment system as well as more secure solutions like Apple Pay, Android Pay, etc.
None of that costs even a penny to use.
Even sending money between two personal bank accounts can be entirely free.
There is an entirely free standard method that can take a couple days, or there’s an instant “eTransfer” email system that costs a flat $1 (many large banks cover this fee for you). Not to mention nearly all banks have free, instant transfers to other internal accounts.
Bitcoin dropped the ball on cheap transactions, and is now almost exclusively a (extremely volatile) long term store of value.
@_date: 2017-12-25 08:33:33

@_date: 2017-12-06 20:57:09
There’s always the potential of slowing down too much, and missing the boat for mass adoption.
People are getting interested in Bitcoin now. We need to wow them *now*, not in 2 or 3 years. By then they’ll have forgotten about it and moved on.
@_date: 2017-12-27 07:42:15
Because if they got burned by it once and stopped accepting it, it'll be harder to convince them to accept it again once it's useable.
@_date: 2017-12-07 06:47:19
But you have to admit, losing a merchant as large as Steam is at least somewhat concerning, no?
Especially when they specifically mention high fees, and volatility as the reasons for dropping support for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-15 12:38:04
Ugh. I wish they spelled it “correct”.
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:36:38
Valve literally makes billions. Off of loot boxes in CSGO, and by taking a 30% fee from *every single purchase* on Steam. They aren’t hurting for cash.
They used Bitpay anyways, so they most likely haven’t been holding any Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:13:24
It still doesn’t solve the issue of high fees, and users complaining about them, or not having transactions confirm in a timely manner.
@_date: 2017-12-27 22:22:38
And back then they were saying “a few months”... and today, two years later, they are saying the same.
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:12:34
Are we not justified freaking out, even slightly, that Bitcoin once matched their desired use case, but now does not.
It isn’t a good sign for remaining merchants, and will make any potential future merchants think twice.
That won’t be good for adoption.

Yet there were two separate agreements that would have guaranteed Segwit adoption by them, and Core was against both of them. Could have had 2Mb blocks *and* Segwit over a year ago, but no. They won’t compromise at all.

Meh. I have one bank and one credit card linked to my Paypal (CC only as a backup).
If Paypal tried to fuck me over, I would:
1. Cancel the credit card. 
2. Get bank to reverse charges.
With that said, I would never buy $1000+ items through paypal. I mostly use Paypal for smaller purchases, simply because it's easier. I don't think someones going to bother screwing me over on a $10-$100 purchase.
@_date: 2015-06-06 06:01:01


I don't keep anything in my Paypal account. It's linked to my bank account, so when I buy something it gets deducted the next business day.
And before you say, my bank isn't terrible like most peoples seem to be. If Paypal fucks up and charges me for something I didn't buy, my bank would have no problem reversing said charges.
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:20:28
Yeah, that’s why I said


Our national Interbank network (Interac) is a non-profit corporation. 
As a merchant, if you don’t want to pay the ridiculous Visa/MC/Amex fees, then you don’t have to accept credit. If you have a bank account, you have an Interac Debit card.
@_date: 2015-06-04 14:24:40

In Canada, Like in Germany, debit cards are completely different than credit cards (Interac network). Most merchants do accept credit cards, but the majority of people prefer to use debit. In 2007 there was a total of 156 Billion CAD in Debit (Interac) transactions.
Debit is safer. It uses Chip and Pin technology. If you lose your card, someone can't use it without knowing your pin.
It only takes me a few seconds to do a debit transaction, so Apples whole video showing a "standard transaction" is bullshit.
Also, there aren't any fees for using debit. My current bank account offers unlimited debit transactions, a good interest rate, and costs me $0.
@_date: 2014-12-11 11:46:10

From my experience in Cancun (and by Cancun I mean not inside the hotel zone. The actual city) their convenience/corner stores are actually quite convenient, and not ridiculously priced.

Recently they have been signing their replies as "Blockchain.info" or "BC.I". I don't have a problem with them keeping their domain/company name the same as long as they continue doing this.
I mean, I get what they were trying to do with their domain. "Blockchain.Info". They show information from the blockchain. Clever. Except people don't refer to a company by their subdomain. You don't say "Google DOT COM", or "Wikipedia DOT ORG". So it naturally got shortened by themselves (and the community) to "Blockchain".
You have to agree that it's partially our fault for calling them Blockchain. If more and more people start calling them "BC.I", then thats what they'll be known as.

Actually FWIW Apple doesn't see any payment information. It's stored in the Secure Enclave. When you use ApplePay, all it sends is a one-time-use verification code. No card data is sent to any 3rd party afaik.
@_date: 2014-12-13 09:16:24
Dogecoin is also inflationary. I'd say that's a pretty big difference.
@_date: 2014-05-17 06:52:51

@_date: 2014-06-20 02:54:42
I'm assuming in the settings you would be able to add/remove altcoins from the drop down list.
@_date: 2014-11-20 02:16:20
No. Again, all card details are encrypted in the Secure Enclave. It's a physically separated chip on the phone. It's hardware that's designed so you can't read data from it. Only request a one-time-use verification code. Even if the phones operating system is hacked, you can't get any data out of it. 
AFAIK This is how the process works (Correct me if I'm wrong):
Think of it like public/private keys. The Secure Enclave holds the Private Key. You cannot read the Private Key from it. It only ever hands out one-time-use Public Keys. 
1. You buy a pack of gum at the store. The Secure Enclave creates a new Public Key and sends it.
2. The public key goes to the transaction processor and/or bank, where because the bank knows your Private Key (it's their account) they can say "Yes that Public Key belongs to an account here".
The only one that can see your account details is your bank and the Secure Enclave. Everyone else (Merchant, Tech support, etc) sees the one-time-use code.
Now comparing that to Bitcoin, any merchant I make a purchase at can theoretically trace it back on the blockchain, find my wallet, and see every single transaction I've ever made. If they know that the address "1Sxy..." is a sex shops payment address, they could see that I've made a purchase there.
Apple Pay is not meant to be an entirely new concept like Bitcoin. It's just a way to make the legacy banking system easier to use, and a little safer at the same time.
@_date: 2014-11-20 04:34:49
And what about my comparison to Bitcoin? Literally anyone you buy/sell with can track every single transaction you've made on the blockchain. It's anonymous until you make a transaction.
@_date: 2014-01-25 13:20:50

I haven't seen that discussed anywhere on Reddit before. I've thought about it myself.
GHash *knows* we fear them getting 51%. What if they simply point some of their miners to different, smaller "unknown" pools (on IP's not associated with their main pool). We only see them as ~40%, but secretly they could have as much as 59% of the hashing power.

@_date: 2014-01-27 03:13:29
Yeah, this actually happens periodically with credit unions on the Interac network (usually in small towns). Either a connection goes down, or the credit union has some other problems, so their debit cards are useless for a few hours until they get it fixed.
@_date: 2017-02-26 21:10:26


Wait, are fees really that high nowadays?
In Canada, I can pay a $1 bank fee to send money to literally anyone's bank account, and it'll appear in about 15 minutes.
So now Bitcoin is not only slower, but more expensive for me to transact Peer2Peer.
@_date: 2014-11-11 04:19:57
Except you would have to wait until the year 2140 to be able to buy "ALL of the bitcoins". Even then, the act of buying them up would increase the price, thus making it expensive for you to buy more and more. I'm sure many people would sell once the price starts going up, but others might hold on. 
Not to mention what would the point of buying them all up be? Just wanting to burn a few billion dollars?

I hate to ask since you addressed it above but no chance of shipping less than 10 to Canada? Even though it is technically International, it doesn't really seem like it. I've never had a large time delay when ordering items from the US, and our two Postal systems seem to work well together. Also, if I paid in Bitcoin then there would be no way to chargeback, so thats one less thing to worry about. I'd be interested in 2 or 3, but I couldn't justify 10 at the moment.

A credit-card charge-back is much easier to do than performing a double-spend attack. For charge-backs, the vendor not only loses the money, but also gets hit with additional fees. 
So payment networks don't always guarantee zero fraud, just that there are methods in place that make it not worth your time for smaller purchases.

Now you know what many people think about Core and Segwit.

Nobody is saying to entirely get rid of the limit. Just increase it, since there is obvious demand. It would be a very simple code change, that even Satoshi has suggested in the past. That would be the simple, safest solution, yet Blockstream refuses to do it.

If you make a new Segwit compatible key pair, and move all your funds out of standard keys. 
If not, then you're still using the standard system and adhere to 1mb blocks.
It literally requires action by every single user in order to switch all transactions to Segwit transactions.
Malleability, etc, can still occur for any user that doesn't switch over to a new key pair right away. (Nothing ever has 100% user adoption. There are always people that don't care, don't know, or don't want to use it)

There shouldn't be a single group of people that control Bitcoin development. Period. Whether it's Bitcoin Unlimited, or Core.
Core has their own agenda, that I believe does not fit with what the Whitepaper described. They've shown countless times that they will ignore any criticism or suggestions, and have actively denied facts about Bitcoin and it's development. Core does not want open, decentralized development.
And while I would much rather support something closer to Classic Bitcoin, at the moment, Bitcoin Unlimited seems to be the best chance at getting any change from the status quo.

So you're perfectly fine with Bitcoin development being centralized? Nobody can fork their code, make modifications, etc, etc, except for one group of developers?
What if their interests change and become misaligned with our own? What is our course of action? Just sit back and let them do whatever they want because they were there first?
As well, Core does not define what Bitcoin is. There could be many independently developed clients for all it cares. As long as they're compatible with what the majority of users want, then it's still Bitcoin. Because consensus dictates what is, and is not Bitcoin.
Nobody owns the Blockchain, so nobody can "steal it" from Core. If Core came out and said their client is the sole user of the current blockchain, then people would start leaving in droves.
As well, if would be stealing the name if BU was trying to call itself Core. But they are not. If anything, Core stole the name "Satoshi" for their client userstring, and should change that to avoid confusion.
@_date: 2017-03-17 18:50:43


I'm aware of that, but it's the publics perception that matters.

@_date: 2017-03-16 17:52:06
P2P cash, not a settlement layer for banks and companies.
While I don't think Segwit and LN are bad ideas at all, I feel that we should focus on making Bitcoin great as a P2P cash, before adding new systems and layers.
I also feel it's disingenuous for Core to act as if they intended for Segwit to include a block size increase. It just so happens to increase it slightly as a by-product. It was never intended as a main feature for Segwit, and was not something they were planning for. Which to me, shows that they do not care about on chain scaling.
@_date: 2017-03-23 17:07:39

Even if the network forks, one will become the longest chain and be the true Bitcoin, and the other will become nearly worthless.

In that case, they can update Core to only deem "Satoshi" clients valid. I would *love* to see them do that.


Again, no. They are discerning themselves from Core by calling their client Bitcoin **Unlimited**. Not Bitcoin **Core**, or just straight **Bitcoin**. 


Please explain how mining 100% compatible blocks is spamming the blockchain.
As well, LukeJr's own "Bitcoin Knots" client would do all of the above claimed by you. Are you advocating that he should cease development/use of his non-standard client?
@_date: 2017-03-27 14:48:31
They basically stated that they're being neutral. If a hard for occurs, they will not immediately support one over the other. They will support the longest chain (as SPV clients are designed to), and that users should really just wait for the fork to resolve before making any transactions (which is good advice anyways).
They suspect the smaller chain (whichever it is) may die off eventually, but if it doesn't and has enough users still, they can simply release a second wallet app for it.
@_date: 2017-03-22 06:13:14
Except the block size increase wasn't intentional. So to many it feels like core is ignoring the block size issue, and hoping that this one time coincidental increase will just shut us up for now. Rather than discussing their potential plans for future increases.
If Core came out and said, "we have future plans for on-chain scaling" and discussed them, I'm sure a majority of BU Supporters would have reconsidered. But now all this time has passed, and anger has spread on both sides...
@_date: 2017-03-25 20:35:46
Posting a "goodbye" on Reddit shows that you want *someone* to care, so it can't be purely for your *self* interest.
It's also your ignorance in the fact that they've now clarified their wording. They will support both. If the minority chain doesn't die, they'll simply release a second wallet app. Any wallet that is picking sides (either side) while nothing has happened yet, has clear motivations which should be questioned.
Either side could be the minority. They aren't picking sides at all, they're remaining neutral.

Raising the argument of emergent consensus vs satoshi consensus. I did not raise that topic in my original comment.

It's the same thing as only paying attention to one news outlet. Even the most neutral of parties will have bias, so it's better to take in information from all sides.

More accurate:


It's entirely possible for Core to have the minority chain, no? Especially since 90% or so of miners support Segwit2X.

Ask yourself what defines Bitcoin.
Is it a client made by a specific group?
No, it is whatever the majority deem it to be.
In this case, a majority of miners, and large portion of the community, have picked Segwit2X over Core.
To continue with the mindset that "only Core defines what Bitcoin is" is dangerous. It gives them free reign to do whatever they want, even if it goes against the community's best interest.

Being in control of your own money is. But the average person doesn't care, and trusts banks.
@_date: 2017-08-25 22:57:29
The thing that stumps me is why we think we need to further incentivize miners in the mean time. They have block rewards. By the time the block reward diminishes to almost nothing, there will hopefully be widespread adoption of Bitcoin. At a transaction level similar to VISA, even something like 10 cents per transaction equate to a large enough incentive that somebody will want to mine. 
There is no need at all for fees in the "dollar" range.

Compared to the almost 6,000 global nodes, that is a relatively small contribution. 
You can increase the number of nodes you connect to in the config, but then you use more bandwidth.
The US, Canada, and other places have monthly bandwidth caps with ~~most~~ *some* of their ISP's, so running a full-node with anything more than the default 20 peers is unfeasible for ~~most~~ *some* people. Especially considering 2200 of the ~6000 global nodes are in the US.
For a while I was running a full-node connected to ~75 nodes... and it was quickly eating into my (rather generous) bandwidth cap. *(Yay Canada)*

Spending it shows merchants that there’s demand. If there’s zero demand for purchasing their goods with Bitcoin, why the hell would a merchant spend any time or effort on accepting it?
Spend and replace was working out perfectly fine before. We had places like Humble Bundle, Steam, Expedia, Microsoft and MANY more large retailers accepting it. 
And then blocks got full, which caused price volatility and extremely high fees, and caused confirmation times to skyrocket. That’s when we started to see merchants drop it.
Bitcoin will never see large growth like before if 90% or people are just holding it, praying for the price to go up.
@_date: 2019-12-19 17:39:53
The same argument could be made for simply buying while the price is down.
@_date: 2019-12-13 08:35:07
Yes, and this is why high fees are pointless right now. Miners already have their incentive. They don’t need to collect fees on top of the block reward.
If fees were drastically lower, that would drive real world usage up. More people actually using Bitcoin means more fiat invested, which can mean the price of Bitcoin goes up naturally.
As the block reward slowly reduces over time, the increasing price will help to compensate for that smaller reward.
Only as the block reward nears zero, will we need noticeable fees.

First parts correct, but the network will only slow temporarily, until automatic difficulty adjustment kicks in. 
The network automatically adjusts to stay around 1 block every 10 minutes, regardless of how many miners there are.
Fees will rise, but that’s because less miners are willing to mine at a lower block reward (ie: they’d be mining at a loss), and has nothing to do with the network slowing.

I’ll try and be as neutral as possible, while still trying to make it understandable.
The fork will basically cause there to be two Bitcoins (three if you count the already existing Bitcoin Cash, but that’s another story).
Bitcoin Core, and Bitcoin 2X (also known as Segwit2X).
Bitcoin Core follows the current Bitcoin Core developers roadmap. The core developers believe that we don’t need to increase the block size, and that Bitcoin can scale with other optimization (Segwit, which makes “Witness” data not count towards the 1Mb block size) and off-chain technologies (Such as the Lightning network). 
They believe that increasing the blocksize will make it harder for people to run a node and contribute to the network, (As it will increase storage and bandwidth used), and could lead to further centralization.
Bitcoin 2X believes that increasing the block size was always intended, and that Bitcoin transactions should remain on-chain. (The current 1Mb limit was initially created as an anti-spam measure by Satoshi. The argument here is that it was intended to be temporary, and either be removed or increased as needed).
They believe that the increased storage and bandwidth usage will not affect most users, and is being exaggerated.
Both groups believe they are the “True Bitcoin”. But as Bitcoin isn’t owned by anyone, it’s a bit of a grey area.  Some will say “whichever chain has the most work” , or “largest hashrate”, or “most users”, etc, is the True Bitcoin. But again, it’s all subjective.
The other thing is a lack of Replay Protection.(unless this has changed, I’ve been away for a while)
No Replay Protection means if you make a transaction on one chain after the split, your transaction could also be sent on the other chain. So if you send someone 1 “Core” coin, you’ve also sent them a “2X” coin. People believe that this is dangerous, and could cause uninformed people to lose funds by unintentionally sending both coins, instead of just the one they intended.
I know this isn’t everything, but my lunch break is over. :)

You can essentially limit bandwidth usage by limiting the total number of connections. 
With that said what are your internet speeds? Running a node should not eat enough bandwidth to noticeably degrade your internets peformance.
@_date: 2017-05-17 15:42:18
Ah, in that case I agree with you.
I assumed you were implying that the UASF is safer than a hardfork. But the UASF basically blacklists nodes that aren't signalling for UASF, which is more like what a hard fork does.

Why do we need to see the consequences?
Many other altcoins have flexible blocksizes, or block sizes larger than 1mb and they're doing just fine.
The 1mb limit was intended as a temporary anti-spam measure, while bitcoin was still in it's infancy and barely anyone was using it. Bitcoin didn't always have this limit.

Both of these and more. Contact anyone they're dealing with and let them know that they're a company that's buying and selling Bitcoin, and that after months of dealing with them, you are unable to withdraw $20,000 worth of Bitcoin. DO NOT threaten them with legal action. That's how you get the cold shoulder, since the companies will just wait for you to file legal action. Just inform them what kind of business they're dealing with.

Yes, yes, Luke has gone on and on about "Spam" while not at all letting us know what he considers a "Legitimate Transaction".
If he can ever define what "Spam" and "Legitimate Transactions" are, well, maybe I'll listen to what he's saying. All I'm hearing right now is "Whatever I say".
Besides, any negative effects 2MB blocks will have can be countered with pruning (helps with local storage issues), or limiting your nodes total number of connections (helps with any bandwidth limits you may have). 
Limiting a nodes connection does *not* mean you aren't contributing to the network. You are still cooperating with other nodes, and helping to verify blocks. It's not like every single node needs to be connected to every other node directly anyways. That would be wildly inefficient, and even the modern internet isn't structured that way.


Uhh, I think you're inferring something that's simply not true. It's not that I don't consider your side, it's that I disagree with it. I am allowed to disagree with other peoples opinions, correct? It's not a dictatorship?
I agree Segwit could be quite beneficial to Bitcoin, but I also think that on chain scaling is just as beneficial, and will be required for Bitcoin to thrive as a peer-to-peer currency.
What I disagree with is the core developers attitude to on chain scaling, which is a resounding "never gonna happen" (Despite the fact that the 1MB limit was intended as a temporary anti-spam measure by Satoshi).
Despite what you may think, I have no ill will towards you. I value your opinion just as much as I value my own. I simply hope that we can come to an agreement that benefits us both.
@_date: 2017-05-26 21:51:52

@_date: 2017-05-29 08:46:57
Potentially. If people actually start using Segwit transactions (which they won't on Day 1, since not everything supports Segwit yet).
Otherwise the capacity remains the same, no?
Also, the Hard Fork vs Soft Fork argument would make sense if the "UASF" didn't forcibly cause a chain split, since it's not backwards compatible. It's a hell of a lot closer to a Hard Fork than a Soft Fork.
@_date: 2017-05-27 20:01:55

Storage? Either prune, or go pick up an 8TB hdd for $180. You'll be safe for many, many years.
Bandwidth? Just limit the number of connections. You are still contributing to the network. Not every single node needs to have 100's to 1000's of connections. It's a network, not a grid.
@_date: 2015-03-27 10:40:21
My node is sitting at ~1.5GB outbound in the past 24 hrs. Maybe 100 mb inbound. This is with it restricted to only 30 connections.
So a good 45 gb/month out of my upload cap (which is 250GB). 
Bandwidth limits aren't an issue if you limit it properly. But then you don't contribute as much to the network.

A lot of these Bitcoin companies were started by everyday users like you and I. While maybe not all of them do, many of them believe in the protocol, and want what's best for it.
Besides, the corporations aren't trying to take it over. They're merely giving us another option. If both sides agree to it, then great! If not, then we don't have to use it.
Personally, I think their proposal is a great idea. Both sides get something that they want.
@_date: 2017-05-26 22:15:57
Don't give in to their brainwashings, or the "fear" of their UASF.
If they don't get a majority of users onboard, the UASF will simply fork them off of the network onto their own coin.
While many would prefer to come to an agreement (Segwit + 2MB blocks being proposed), core has shown that they would rather fork off onto their own Alt-coin than co-operate with anyone else.
They want total control over Bitcoin's code.

Besides, it's not like we will instantly start using up all 2Mb of each and every block. Initially we may, but once the transaction backlog shrinks down it'll normalize.

I'm sure all parties involved would have preferred a representative from Core to be there.
Things take time. There might be further discussions on exact dates/timing of events before anyone starts signalling. Or maybe they're waiting for an implementation/binaries to be ready for the general public.
@_date: 2017-05-29 07:59:36
Then ask yourself this. Why wouldn't Blockstream agree to the Segwit+2Mb proposal? They want Segwit. Segwit also breaks Asicboost.
They get everything they want and just have to deal with a measly block size increase to 2mb. Not 4, not 8, not 16. TWO megabytes.
@_date: 2017-05-26 23:59:46
I'm not sure of all the details, but at least someone is attempting to do something, rather than just ignoring the problem altogether.

I was implying that even Blockstreams investors do not have trust in them anymore. Not that there's some grand conspiracy at play.

@_date: 2017-07-28 08:15:36
Supporting Bitcoin Cash is basically you sinking down to the level of UASFers. It's a movement that's been fueled by mountains and mountains of FUD.
Do you really think a minority fork like BCC can survive when the majority are instantly selling their "free BCC"? The price will plummet, and overnight it will be a worthless coin with barely any devs supporting it.
Besides, a fork like this undermines the potential of Segwit2X's 2Mb hardfork. It just gives them more to point at when they say "See? This is why we don't like hardforks".
BCC should have planned to fork off if the Segwit2X 2Mb fork fails. Not before.
@_date: 2017-05-17 15:34:07
The opposite. Edited my original to make it a little more clear.
This "softfork" *will* fork the network unless you get an overwhelming majority of users on board. Which has not happened yet.

@_date: 2017-07-28 10:42:30
Regarding 2X,  
There were enough miners not supporting Segwit to "stall" it for this long.
All of the sudden those that were not showing support for Segwit have been showing support for Segwit2X. If these miners merely wanted Segwit activated, they would have been supporting it from the start.
So 2X may not have a huge majority, but I don't believe it is as much of a "vocal minority" as many assume.
  
  
  
  
As a side note regarding PoW forks, etc, I do believe the current system clearly has flaws. Nodes were initially intended to be miners. Anyone able to run a node was able to "vote" for consensus. 
Nowadays we have all these user run nodes that are unable to "vote", and a small pool of miners that hold all the cards. We need to somehow give the power of consensus back to the community. 
However, I believe a change to PoW would be too "shocking". It would draw fire from the current miners, who have invested a large amount into their operations. It would make people more hesitant to invest in mining, or Bitcoin in general. It could potentially cause a lot of people to lose faith in the system.
@_date: 2017-07-14 20:07:23

Segwit2X is a proposed compromise between Big Blockers and Segwit Supporters.
It will activate Segwit right away, and then hard fork in 3 months to increase the block size from 1Mb to 2Mb.
It is being spearheaded by Bitcoin Core contributor Jeff Garzik.
Jihan Wu is a co-founder of Bitmain, a company that makes Bitcoin mining Asic's. Jihan supports Segwit2X (along with many other Bitcoin businesses) and pledges to run it once the client passes testing. 
Because he runs Bitmain, people assume theres some grand conspiracy with miners and Segwit. That miners don't want Segwit because it will eat into their fees.
(But why would miners support Segwit2X if they're scared of Segwit???)
Also worth noting is that Segwit2X is basically the Hongkong agreement that previously failed. It failed most likely because of how Blockstream CEO Adam Back signed the agreement. It was implied that he was signing as Blockstreams CEO, but later he stated that he merely signed as an individual, and not as Blockstream. This caused infighting, and many to back out of it as they started doubting each other's intentions.
So far a majority have pledged to run Segwit2X, and are signalling their intent in UAcomments/client names by adding "NYA", for "New York Agreement".

Okay, lemme take a crack at it.
Imagine a block is a bus. 
It can only fit 25 people, because they're all bringing a couple suitcases each. Segwit is strapping the luggage to the roof. Now you can fit more people inside the bus.
(Less eli5: You are **Seg**regating the "**Wit**ness Data" that each transaction has and storing it outside of the 1Mb block. It won't take up valuable block space, and you'll be able to fit more transactions inside the block instead)

To be fair, the decline in dominance has been during a time that the Bitcoin community as a whole has most definitely not been at peace.

It's just frustrating that when any potential to reconcile comes along, a new party comes in and starts swinging their arms.
@_date: 2017-07-17 21:34:36
Marginally. Like, milliseconds longer to propagate across the network, if that.
The average block time will still be 10 minutes.
Also, keep in mind the 1Mb limit wasn't always there. It was intended as a temporary anti-spam measure. Even Satoshi outlined a simple way to increase the limit in the future.
If Satoshi didn't intend for us to increase it, he wouldn't mention it.  If he foresaw issues with raising it, he would have mentioned them.

@_date: 2017-07-18 21:36:54
There will be a hard fork, but not necessarily a split.
In most cases, there will only be a hard fork if something like 80+% of miners agree to it (if 80% of blocks mined during a specific period are by miners signalling support).
Anyone on the smaller chain (with less than 20% of mining power) would have to switch to the majority chain if they wanted to keep transacting with everyone else. As well, with only 20% of mining power, the smaller chain will have longer block times until a difficulty adjustment period is hit. So there would be even less reason to mine on that chain. Because of these factors, the smaller chain won't survive very long at all.
With how Segwit2X works, the activation of Segwit2X also locks the hard fork in to occur in 3 months (12,960 blocks after activation). If you're running Segwit2X, then there's no backing out on the hardfork as it's already coded into your client.
I suppose miners could decide to stop supporting the hardfork and switch back to Core before the hard fork date, but that wouldn't make any sense. That would mean they've supported regular Segwit without a blocksize increase this whole time. If they supported that they would have already signalled for it. Segwit would have been activated long ago.
@_date: 2017-05-30 07:43:05
And what if the other 90% do the exact same thing to you?
@_date: 2017-05-09 14:41:02




Yet Core denies the 1Mb limit was a temporary anti-spam measure. Even Satoshi described a way to increase it (or phase it out) at a later date.
Core has shown again and again that they don't care about "Satoshi's vision", otherwise they wouldn't be so vehemently against on-chain scaling.
I think for many it's not about supporting BU, but for showing that they don't support core.
Edit: More accurate phrasing.

I'm aware.
Peace in this case would most likely be us acknowledging that we have our disagreements, but that we both want what we think is best for Bitcoin. And then working together to try and make it work out.
But at this stage, nobody is willing to work together if new groups keep separating...
@_date: 2017-05-26 22:34:09
You shouldn't listen to anyone from *either* side.
Before making any sort of decision, I'd suggest looking into it the whole situation further. What you will find on either subreddit is biased one way or another. 
You have to read through information from all sides to paint the full picture, and even then, there is a whole bunch of misinformation or just straight lies.
Don't do what I say, don't do what says. Look into it yourself and do what you believe is best for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-06-03 19:39:41
I'm just saying, in the event that this one does succeed. If it succeeds because a majority of people were only worried about not causing a chain split, that's a bad precedent.
If somehow this gets 40-50%, and an unpopular one gets even 20%, that fear is going to come back to people.
@_date: 2017-06-03 10:43:35
It's been 8 years since Bitcoin was first released into the wild. [Internet speeds have dramatically increased since then]( You can now pick up a 1Tb harddrive for under $50. 
Is it really unreasonable to increase the block size by 1Mb? Not increasing to 4, or 8, or 16. But to two megabytes. 
After 8 years? 
Bitcoin will still run on that old machine on a shitty connection with a low monthly cap.

As said, mining isn't profitable with top of the line graphics cards, let alone on a cellphone. You would end up spending more on electricity than you would ever get back in Bitcoin.
Even with ASIC's (specially designed hardware for mining), you operate on razor thin margins. One reason many mining operations are in China is because of their subsidized electricity costs.
On top of that, mining on your phone would cause it to heat up, since phones don't have any active cooling. While the phone should warn you and shut itself off before heat causes any damage, I wouldn't risk it.
You would be better off looking into one of the many exchanges to buy Bitcoin. Coinbase is probably the most trusted exchange for anyone in the US (although I haven't personally dealt with them). You could also check to see if there are any Bitcoin ATM's in your city.
Just remember, these services usually charge a fee. With ATM's usually having a higher fee than exchanges.
Also, it's generally a bad idea to trust exchanges with your Bitcoin. Move it to a wallet that you control as soon as possible. (Breadwallet is what I personally use on my iPhone).
@_date: 2017-06-03 19:59:54
But how long does it need to run on that old computer? Will it need to run on that same machine 10 years into the future? Then it will be running on ~~28~~ 18 year old hardware (assuming that machine has been running a node since the very start, and that the hardware even lasts that long).

I'm not an analyst by any means, but if a split occurs and isn't resolved swiftly, it could destroy the confidence people have in Bitcoin. It could shift a lot of users over to coins like Ethereum or Litecoin.
As blocks remain full, and fees keep rising, Bitcoins dominance is falling. 45% currently. Add a bunch of users fed up with high fees/an inconvenient chain-split, and we could even see something like Ethereum take over as largest market cap.
Here's hoping the Segwit2x development goes smoothly, and that there's overwhelming support for it once someone produces a node/client.
Both sides make a compromise, but both sides ultimately get what they want. No need for a UASF.
@_date: 2017-06-04 07:27:15
Miners are already getting block rewards. We don't need a "Fee Market" for a very long time.
Saying "Blocks should remain full" is basically saying "We should pay miners twice!"
@_date: 2017-06-03 20:48:05
Even most of is okay with Segwit. We just want a block size increase as well.
UASF shows us that Core would rather risk splitting the community further apart than listen to the concerns of some of the users.
@_date: 2017-06-02 20:51:10
I'd just like to respond and say that the majority of people (including miners) aren't against Segwit. We're just against "Only Segwit". The majority of people agreed to a compromise of "Segwit+2Mb" which is literally being worked on right now. There will be an alpha client coming out eventually, etc etc.
Even the "big-bad" creator of Asicboost has agreed to "Segwit+2Mb", which could also kill Asicboost.
The real people holding back any progress are some key Core devs that are vehemently against any sort of block-size increase. Some of which have actually advocated for a block-size *decrease*.
It's these same devs that created the UASF, which acts more like a Hard Fork since it's not backwards compatible, and *will* cause a chain split.
Right now, it will fork the 12 or so percent of people that are *for* the UASF off onto their own network.
Which coin has more claim to the name Bitcoin? One with 12% of the users and barely any miners? Or one with 88% of the users, a majority of miners, and a majority of major Bitcoin services that has a plan to properly, **and safely**, scale in the very near future.
@_date: 2017-06-19 11:35:58
2MB every 10 minutes is what, 3.5 KB/s? Wish more people would realize how relatively small 2MB blocks are.
@_date: 2017-06-03 09:45:56
That sets a rather dangerous precedent though.
If you give in this time, it shows everyone else that you'll give in the next time there's a UASF.
Next thing you know, there are a whole bunch of hostile people making threats to "bring the whole thing down" unless they get what's on their list of demands.
@_date: 2017-06-03 09:51:36
Link doesn't work for me?
The problem with Core is that some Devs will say one thing, and others will say something completely different. While they are all individuals and have their own opinions, they should learn to act as a team and make solid decisions and not contradict each other.
Right now the community assumes all of Core believes whatever the most vocal members say (Luke being probably the most vocal of them all right now). There's no clear direction.
@_date: 2017-06-03 11:05:44
While I agree there is demand for Segwit, it appears the majority of people do not want to use such a dangerous activation method. Otherwise the total % of signalling nodes would be higher than 11%.

Last I heard it was about 1.7Mb, which is not even double.
This is also assuming 100%, instant adoption. Otherwise it will take months and months to get people and services to switch over from regular transactions.
@_date: 2017-06-08 17:10:55
It'll take time for users and services to switch over to Segwit transactions. Otherwise, if you use standard transactions you're still confined to the same 1Mb limit, afaik.
The real concern with a UASF is a chain-split. Which can greatly affect miners if the side they back ends up not winning. Not to mention if there is a split it would most likely negatively affect the price of both chains, thus temporarily diminishing miner revenue, regardless of what side you back. (But then that's only *if* there's a split)
As it is right now, UASF has about 5% of nodes (10% of nodes signal for it, but only half of those would actually enforce it). Mining power is harder to determine, but last I heard it's around 5-10% as well.
@_date: 2017-06-10 11:28:59
RemindMe! 3 months "Did he break even."
@_date: 2017-06-20 08:12:39
It does if the miners are mining blocks your client deems invalid. Unless you like being forked off onto a network that has minimal mining power, where it will be *months* until the next difficulty change.
@_date: 2017-06-04 09:11:04
I found a couple articles like [this one](
It sounds like some have concluded that 1.7 will likely be the average size. However, the Lightning co-author has managed to create blocks larger than that (3.7).
But again that's still assuming 100% Segwit adoption. It takes time for wallets, services, and users to switch over and start using it.
Updating to a new node client is quicker than changing code for your website, exchange, wallet, etc to start allowing the use of Segwit. It's not just back-end changes. Its UI changes as well.
@_date: 2017-06-20 08:09:26
Those signalling for NYA are signalling that they're for the Hard Fork. Sure, some could change their mind later, but then why wouldn't they have supported Segwit from the start?
And before you say "Saving Face", wouldn't backing out of the NYA make them *lose* face? It would show that you can't trust their word anymore.
@_date: 2017-06-19 11:31:03
It's already coded? Currently being tested.
@_date: 2017-06-04 08:25:48
Once they come out with an alpha version of a client, we'll start to see how many people will support Segwit2X. (A majority from both sides seem to be okay with Segwit.. so it's really just how many people are okay with 2Mb blocks. Hard to tell when there's such a vocal minority advocating for the UASF.)
Lets hope it helps bring this divided community back together.
@_date: 2017-06-04 09:19:53
But you just said blocks should remain full.
So what you're saying is, we should use blocks until they're full, and then any overflow goes off-chain?
That's not how it works though. There's no way to make a transaction and say "use main-chain if it's not full, but use off-chain if it is".
If blocks are full on main chain, than the fees are going to keep increasing. That's just basic supply and demand. If there's more demand than supply, prices go up.
@_date: 2017-05-29 08:22:07
Except the "UASF" is a Hard Fork in disguise.
The point of a Soft Fork is to *not* force a chain split.
The "UASF" purposefully splits the chain by not being backwards compatible. It should not be called a Soft Fork at all.

Curious, what's your estimated ROI on that rig?
@_date: 2017-06-19 11:50:40
Because you're connecting to more than one node.
You can limit the number of connections in your config file, which will essentially limit your bandwidth usage.
If you regularly have 100 connections, and limit it to 50, you'll effectively half your bandwidth usage.
@_date: 2013-12-14 16:59:36
Apple made those rules before bitcoin was a thing so how is that anti-bitcoin? They didn't make those rules with the intent to block bitcoin apps. Bitcoin is just recently getting popular, so maybe they will/are considering changing some rules. They just have to be careful when/if they change rules,because they don't want to allow anything sketchy and shady. Besides, It's not like there are thousands of people making wallet apps getting rejected.
@_date: 2017-06-03 09:42:30
Just limit your total number of peers. You'll still contribute to the network. Your node doesn't need to be connected to literally every other node out there. That solves 99% of bandwidth issues.
I think a majority of people are for Segwit, and the benefits it brings. However, Segwit won't be fully adopted overnight. It could take many months before it's utilized in any meaningful way (has Litecoin utilized it at all yet?). So until then we'll still be stuck with full blocks. 
Why not lock in a blocksize increase at the same time you activate Segwit. That way if Segwit adoption takes longer than expected, you have standard block capacity to utilize.
If Segwit adoption really picks up, blocksizes will naturally go back down anyways (it's not like we'll *have to* use all 2Mb). In this case, we'd have the 2Mb blocksize as a sort of "Burst Capacity", in times where usage might spike for a short period of time.
@_date: 2017-06-01 07:09:16
No, what you said is correct.
The 1Mb limit was initially created as a temporary anti-spam measure.
The UASF isn't really even a "soft-fork", as it will purposefully cause a chain split, as it is not backwards compatible.
Many people have advocated and agreed to a 2Mb+Segwit compromise, except for some very vocal core devs which are vehemently against it, for unknown reasons.
Even Jihan agreed to the 2Mb+Segwit idea, which would kill Asicboost anyways. So all those claiming Asicboost is why they need to UASF are barking up the wrong tree.
And yes, storage space will get cheaper and cheaper. Not to mention there's client pruning, limiting total # of connections, etc. Bandwidth increase from 2Mb blocks is a non-issue.
@_date: 2017-06-01 07:01:01
So we should wait until we hit the limit, and then repeat this same shit-show all over again?
Not to mention, Segwit only increases capacity if people start using Segwit transactions. If they use regular old transactions, there's no noticeable increase.
Do you think literally everyone is going to switch over on day 1? No. It will take time for people to switch over, once the services they relied on have also switched over.
@_date: 2017-06-04 08:32:20
So far I'm very hopeful for Segwit2x. 
If the tech looks safe, and everything goes smoothly, I hope the community can set aside their differences and work together again.
@_date: 2017-06-19 12:15:24
Yep, which is why I said elsewhere it all depends on the number of nodes you're connected to. Thanks for the neat calculator. Much simpler than the one I hobbled together.
@_date: 2013-12-26 00:43:03
There is one. It's a block away from the Scotiabank Theatre downtown at a Waves Coffee Shop. It's pretty straight forward to use. I believe it uses the MtGox rate, converted to CAD. Not a *horrible* rate, but not a good one either.
@_date: 2013-12-16 00:00:35
Thanks for responding! I'll definitely be looking forward to the second revision then, and I'll keep an eye on how you guys are doing. :)

They're most likely running BU until a Segwit2X client is released. They're signalling that once Segwit2X is ready, they'll support it.
Not really that alarming.

Blockchain has pretty high fees (as others have pointed out. I have yet to use it for any transactions), and just plain doesn't look pretty. It's UI is pretty ugly, it hasn't been updated in about a year, and it doesn't even have the proper height for the iPhone 5,5C, or 5S.
Sure, it technically works, but it would be nicer if they could update the app without fearing that it will bring Apples attention to them, resulting in a swift removal from the App Store. Besides, more options/competition is always good.
Now Coinjar... well it's about time I look into them.
@_date: 2017-06-02 22:09:22
The fact that doing so would remove all trust in Bitcoin, and would plummet the price to zero faster than Luke can shitpost.

That's not that bad, although its still about 1GB for the last month of blockchain data.

Additionally, if you delete the app for whatever reason, and then it gets pulled, it will still appear in your Purchased Apps section in the App Store, where you can still download it to any existing or new devices.

I agree. I get that it's to be like " but nothing else uses the slashes.
@_date: 2013-12-10 08:48:21
Nope. The version in the App Store has full functionality. You can send/receive Bitcoins just fine. 
With that said, the app sure isn't pretty looking, and it doesn't even have the proper height for the 5/5C/5S. I think they haven't updated it in a while because then it would tip Apple off. They seem to be hiding in the shadows for now.
@_date: 2013-12-12 11:00:05


 
39 seconds in. That was definitely cringe-worthy.

Mobile wallets are already friendly enough. All the supermarket would have to do is make the screen that shows your total generate a QR code that gives an address to pay, and requests the total amount owed. Scan it with your phone, and all you have to do is hit "send".
It's all up to the supermarkets.

That's simply because iPhones don't have NFC in them.
@_date: 2013-12-12 10:19:55
Adding to this:
The Blockchain.info iPhone app can't scan it properly either. It takes forever, and then once it scans, the result is one or two letters/numbers, like "P" or "B8".
The iPhone app "Scan" can read it, ~~but it doesn't automatically open the BlockChain.info app like it normally does when scanning bitcoin QR codes.~~
**Edit:** Scan only opens the Blockchain app if the address is formatted like "bitcoin:**//**address" and not just "bitcoin:address" I just assumed all were formatted like that since the blockchain apps are.
@_date: 2013-11-09 12:34:34


Do you have any friends that use iPhones, and if so, do you know what mobile wallet they prefer? It seems that due to the closed nature of the App Store (and Apple rejecting most wallet apps), my only real options are Coinbases recently added app, or Blockchain.info's app/mobile website.
Blockchain has the added benefit that I would still retain control of the wallet, and can make backups of it whenever. If I understand correctly, Coinbase has control of their wallet addresses, so if they get hacked or shut down, any bitcoins I have with them would go poof.
@_date: 2013-12-14 03:07:44
I'm a little late to the party here but...
What about countries that use chip and pin technology? Is that something you will be looking into in the future, or is it something that's not currently possible? If I remember correctly, Coin said that their future versions will include it.
Why I ask is, in Canada, mag-stripe transactions will no longer be accepted at POS after December 31, 2015. They already aren't allowed at ATMs.
While I've pre-ordered a Coin, I did so knowing that it's lifetime is about 2 years, so it won't hugely affect me. Since BitStripe would have a rechargeable battery, it's lifetime would be longer than that (hopefully), but it would effectively be useless after 2 years anyways without a chip. 
Being able to fund with Bitcoin would be awesome, but I fear that by the time you manufacture and ship them out, they'll be entirely useless within Canada.

Blockchain doesn't actually have access to wallets though. As long as you have strong passwords/2FA, and make regular (encrypted) backups of your Blockchain wallet, you should be safe. 
Something like coinbase, where you don't have full control of your wallet, is what I wouldn't trust anything more than pocket change with.
I have 2 16+ digit passwords, and 2FA with Blockchain. It would be a lot easier for someone to skim my debit/credit cards than to hack into my Blockchain wallet. Hell, even my banks website would be easier to access.
