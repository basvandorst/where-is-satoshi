Thanks guys,
I’ve looked into one and supplied information and now hoping for the best.
I’ve definitely learnt my lesson now and will be getting rid of this shitty app.

Very funny? Mate this is far from very funny, the app suggested to buy BCH and I had no idea otherwise.
I fucked up big time.

So there is nothing that can be done then? Sorry for my ignorance I am too new at this.

Bitcoin, using the Bitcoin.com App on the AppleStore

Never mind it appears BCH means Bitcoin Cash, that’s what I used.

This is a good idea, I will definitely take this onboard.
Thanks mate

Google mate, first thing that popped up was the Bitcoin subreddit. 
Also lurking is not a crime is it?
Furthermore I had no idea of the difference between the two, the first option I was given was BCH so naturally assumed it was the more popular one. I am not after your sympathy was just merely asking a question of which has now educated me on the matter.
The figures used kept fluctuating and the app kept alternating between USD and AUD, the 650 leans more to the AUD (though it’s more) side even though I said USD, my bad.

Again, not here for sympathy just merely advice which practically everyone in here has given and I greatly appreciate it, mistakes happen and having never used Crypto Curreny before I don’t consider this mistake to be that bad, it’s only about $700.
But most importantly I have learned, thanks to all for the sound advice.

Yeah it sucks. But shit happens and now I know better. Heh
