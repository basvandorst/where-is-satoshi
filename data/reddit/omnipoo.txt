It’s only a loss if you sell low. Crypto is like shrodingers cat. Only points that matter are what you buy and what you sell for anything in between is like checking to see if that cat is alive or dead. Until you sell it’s the only way to know if you’ve made profit. If you sell low and don’t hodl then that’s your choice.

Crypto tax in Aus is amazing. Basically on all Aus exchanges they charge you gst and that’s all as long as your not a business using bitcoin.

So with your statement as long as someone is not cashing out more then 10k per transaction (which most exchanges won’t let you do) your in the clear?

Where are you getting this information from? Can’t see any government legislation or ATO guidelines but the one I linked. Which makes no mention of a declaration for personal use.

Oh the blockchain has record of every satoshi that has ever existed and will exist. We know where they all are. Some wallet addresses are known and others are a complete mystery. That’s the magic of bitcoin.
