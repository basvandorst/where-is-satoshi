I'm not going to take a position on whether that's a reasonable conclusion for now. But the behavior you're describing is petty, it's useless, it serves as a barrier to entry for new people to have to wade through, it makes discussion more cumbersome, and it casts suspicion over your position.

It's possible, but not necessarily that easy. I had this problem myself. The foreign bank might want to see that the applicant has a local address, or works in the country, or has a credit history in that country, etc. I wouldn't be surprised if a certain subset of Greeks find it easier to just sit down at their computer and spend an hour or two finally figuring that bitcoin thing out.

The immediate problem for the average Stavros is that he doesn't want to wake up tomorrow and find that he can't get into his bank account, and that the day after he's been given a substantial involuntary haircut. *That* is the immediate problem that bitcoin is poised to solve; not the underlying insolvency of the state.

It's because they saw war with the US as inevitable at that point. They wanted the first strike advantage, but they didn't finish the job.

I have been shouting that the sky is falling about this issue for a while now, but so far I have been wrong. However, since it hasn't come up in a while, this is my prediction:
It won't matter that they had nothing to do with the theft. If, IRL, someone is caught with stolen property, it gets taken from them and returned to the owner. Maybe you won't get in trouble for it, but you don't get to keep it.
So, if in a criminal theft of bitcoin (Mt. Gox or any other), if the following are true:
* stolen bitcoins can be traced to a specific address
* the owner of that address can be identified
* the owner of the address is in a legal jurisdiction that is willing to take action on the theft
then, the person who ended up with the stolen coins is likely to be compelled to give them up. I think this could ultimately be very bad for Bitcoin fungibility. If you ultimately end up with a stolen dollar bill, well, that would be hard to prove. But if your coins can definitively be traced through the ledger to a theft, you might be out of luck.
@_date: 2017-06-22 09:59:46
I don't discount that that would be an effective way of covering your tracks. What I am saying is *given* the above situation - you are proven to be holding a substantial amount of stolen Bitcoins - you stand to have them taken from you.

Couldn't a large single transaction could still cause a single address to end up with a large chunk of taint? Like if someone transfers 10BTC to an empty intermediate address (the thief), and that intermediate address transfers the coins to an unwitting recipient (all of it, say as part of a larger transaction), then you could have a bunch of concentrated yellow, no?
What if the unwitting recipient is an altcoin exchange? After it hits the exchange it would get fragmented to many users. I'd worry about a case being made against the exchange, possibly...

Yeah okay, but that doesn't say much. I'm trying to get a handle on what the goal underlying such bots might be. In particular, they seem to fill in one-cent increments between other bids, and to try to sit at the top of the order book most of the time, or to raise the top. If it were as simple as trying to confuse buyers by pushing up the bid price for applications that only look at the top bid without seeing how much is available, they wouldn't fill in the one-cent increments. So what effect does doing *that* have, and why is it done?

This is the theft and laundering of 100 million dollars of drug money, not convenience store change. The police will be involved, and the blockchain is incontrovertible proof of the theft.

The point is that it effectively DOES make a blacklist, not whether that's their goal. And the exchanges are going to have to treat it as such if they don't want to accept liability for selling the stolen coins, which is what makes it effective as a blacklist.
@_date: 2013-08-07 01:44:48

@_date: 2013-12-03 16:32:23
I'm not aware of any precedent for this, and IANAL, but...
There's no reason the taint would spread in that way - if only .001 stolen BTC is found, then only .001 is stolen property. Also keep in mind there's no automated mechanism for this, the police or a civil suit have to come after you to recover it. Still, when it's a huge amount as it is in this case, you can bet that will happen. And even if a tiny piece shows up on an exchange, that could be crucial to an investigation.

Hey, I'm sorry to hear about this.
The reason people are discouraging this plan is not because we don't want you to mine bitcoins, it's because the requirements for mining make it impossible to succeed without a lot of expensive dedicated hardware. 
Asking if you can do pooled mining with your laptop is, at this point, like asking "how long would it take me to tricycle to Neptune? I really need to go there." The need doesn't make it any more possible. Sorry that nobody has bothered to explain this simply and plainly but I hope that makes things clear. I hope you figure it out, but mining is absolutely not going to help you.

Druggies go to the exchange and say, "Pardon me, but if you sell any coins associated with these addresses you are assisting in laundering drug money."
Actually, never mind the druggies. There will certainly be a criminal investigation. And [as Blockchain shows]( the theft is easily traced.
So police and regulators go to the exchanges and say "Pardon me, but if any of the coins associated with these addresses show up in your vaults, we are seizing them, and you are now helping us with this investigation. And if you sell any of them, you are engaging in money laundering."
Edit - Downvoters: If you think this doesn't add to the discussion, okay, but I would prefer a rebuttal as to why you think this reasoning is unsound.
Druggies or no, sounds like a recipe for an effective blacklist to me.
@_date: 2013-12-03 16:05:37

Well if you are right that BTC-e could resist an investigation, then I guess that would work. However, in the theft of a hundred million dollars I suspect they are going to have their work cut out for them if they choose to accept such a transaction.

If he goes to an exchange to do it, the exchange would have to accept legal liability for making the transaction. Which is why the blacklist thing is a concern. 
Or, after the fact, they might give investigators the altcoin addresses at which they paid him. Which would spread the taint across networks, depending on how established the alt exchanges are (I.e. whether they're likely to be sued or investigated themselves.)

The theft itself is significant news, but I think the lead is being buried here, at least as far as bitcoiners are concerned:
**Forget coinvalidation, looks like a grassroots blacklist created by theft victims is presently under construction.**
I don't blame the guy for going after the thief like a rabid dog, but consider the implications - the purpose of following the transactions is so that when, eventually, the thief tries to cash out in fiat, they'll be able to link the coins to a name. Alternatively, if the exchanges are all contacted with a list of addresses that these stolen coins have been through, we effectively have a blacklist of unsaleable coins. At least, unsaleable on a big exchange with name validation in a relatively law-oriented country. Still, this means a two-tiered value for bitcoins: one type you can sell anywhere, and one you have to sell for a discount in some backalley. 
Consider also that even if some of these coins do make it onto an exchange and get sold, it opens up the exchange to legal liability for selling someone else's stolen property. If, say, a victim goes to CampBX with the history of a coin since its theft, in my non-expert opinion they would have pretty good grounds to demand compensation from BX. This would be an incentive for the exchanges themselves to heed any blacklist that looks halfway reputable - frightening for those of us who are trying to stay on the up and up.
This is a hugely significant inevitability that we are finally going to have to deal with now, or at least watch unfold now.

Interesting - so how would an update like this look once there are stakeholders with competing interests? Say by the time this happens, bitcoin holders don't just include early adopters, services, merchants, and average folk, but also banks, funds, and highly-regulated exchanges.
So part of the community wants to adopt this privacy-friendly feature, but part of it would rather keep everything traceable to comply with whatever regulatory environment has developed by that time. What happens? Do we see a blockchain fork? 
Edit: After reading more about Zerocoin, it looks like implementation wouldn't make a blockchain fork likely, because implementing Zerocoin wouldn't have an effect on the way bitcoins are mined. However what could happen is that people without a Zerocoin-enabled client wouldn't be able to accept zerocoins, I gather? Then again, in that case it seems that the pro-Zerocoin faction wins because they can use Zerocoin spends to withdraw vanilla BTC from other Zerocoin users....? In other words as long as there is enough of a market for Zerocoins, there's not much stopping them from complementing Bitcoins.
This is all assuming the Zerocoin proposals eventually DO get implemented into Bitcoin clients; for now it looks like the Zerocoin devs are planning to launch a new genesis block. I might be a bit shaky on this, just started digging into Zerocoin.

The dollar doesn't have a permanent ledger. If you end up with a coin that was part of this heist, and you go to sell it on an exchange, you are demonstrably dealing in stolen property. I suspect you won't get charged if it wasn't done on purpose, but I'd be surprised if it doesn't end up seized instead, as you end up being investigated as they try to find the thief.
If you buy a bicycle from a bicycle thief, when they find the bike you *might* not get in trouble, but you don't get to keep the bike.
