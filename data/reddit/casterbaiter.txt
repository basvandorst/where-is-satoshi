That is a really cool website.  It is like 'redditing' yourself instead of 'googling' yourself.

I haven't seen a "coinbase added xyz users..." post in a long time! (...which is great btw, not saying that in a jerky way, thanks for digging this up.) 
Looking forward to see if those "rate my portfolio" posts ever come back. If they do, then all this talk of the "next bull run" may hold some weight for me.

Seems like s/he would be personally better off selling off a couple hundred each day for about 36 months. Wrecking the market doesn't seem like it would be in their own best interests.  
I would think DCA'ing out of it would be the best way to reach the max fiat value. Could probably even automate something to drip them into the market at random times throughout the day, set it up once and just forget about it.  
...be a nice problem to have for sure.

Okay, I know this is none of my business, but I'm curious to know if you going to hang onto it or liquidate it?  There are a LOT of very smart and very wealthy people out there that think in 36-48 months those 'several' $BTC could be worth a lot of money.  Like, owning your own small private island kind of money.  
Have you put any thought into backing it up and shelving it for a couple months until your personal life settles down?  Giving yourself some time to get past the trauma and get some mental clarity to think about what you want to do.  Maybe do some research on cryptocurrency and revisit it in the fall.  I personally think your Uncle was onto something, but then again I'm addicted to this stuff so whaddaIknow? 
Either way, I'm sorry for your loss and hope things settle down for you and your family soon.  One last thing, think of your private keys just like you would the physical combination to your own personal bedroom safe -- DO NOT TRUST ANYONE WITH THEM -- EVER.  It is a difficult concept to grasp, but they don't even need the safe, just a copy or picture of the combination in order to empty it.

Don't live there but I have visited several times.  It is beautiful and I love the motto. Peace.
