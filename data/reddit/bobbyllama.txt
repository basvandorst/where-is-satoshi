This isn't an experiment, it's begging.
@_date: 2013-04-11 21:48:19
12 hours? Psh, I went days before getting a reply back regarding missing coins.
@_date: 2013-03-21 15:39:17
Just in case you beat me to it...

The point of a research paper is that you do the research yourself.

That's for him to find out if he chooses he'd like to sell to me.
@_date: 2013-04-10 16:36:39
But it's only $175 to enter the drawing. Totally not a scam!
@_date: 2013-04-12 14:24:18
Consider it a convenience fee for not having to jump through hoops to buy them online.

Sorry, reporting the post didn't even cross my mind. Just felt like leaving a snarky comment as some workday catharsis. But I feel so special knowing that I was reported. :3

Unless you go around advertising how much you have in BTC, how would someone even imagine you'd have digital currency in your home? I doubt the common criminal even knows what a BTC is.

To your thread? Count me in.
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:27:08
At least put in a modicum of effort before asking for help. There's a wealth of information in the sidebar.
@_date: 2013-03-21 15:53:38
Worth a shot.
@_date: 2013-03-12 20:05:13
In that case, is there anything I can get for you today, sir?
@_date: 2013-04-12 15:23:50
I just want half of one. Hoped someone would be willing to part with that.
@_date: 2013-04-09 22:16:50
Yeah, because this doesn't sound like an endorsed testimonial...
@_date: 2013-03-11 20:13:54
New to bitcoin; have a question. I 'rolled the dice' and sent a Coinbase payment to the address listed for the wager I took. In the event I win, a payment would get sent back to my Coinbase account, correct? Sorry if that's a daft question.

I've completed 12 spins and see nowhere to enter an alias. What gives?
EDIT: Nevermind. Had to leave the page and reload before being able to set an alias.
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:12:39
Go pan handle elsewhere.
@_date: 2013-04-12 15:25:32
I don't feel it's worth going through all that effort to buy half of a coin. I just want an even number in my wallet.
@_date: 2013-03-12 20:51:12
Well damn. I'm new to BTC and wouldn't even know where to start. What kind of origami do you make?
@_date: 2013-04-05 17:54:03
I experienced an issue where I attempted to send almost half a coin to a different wallet and the transaction never went through, despite the money being deducted from my account. 
Coinbase has repeatedly ignored emails from me, and on the off chance they do respond they never follow through with what they say.
This experience, plus the fact that they leave transactions Google-able, has led me to ditch my Coinbase account in favor of an alternate online wallet.
@_date: 2013-03-22 11:27:46
Hey, you're awesome. Thank you!
@_date: 2013-04-12 20:13:01
I will give you $25 for .5 BTC if you end up wanting to sell some.
@_date: 2013-03-11 20:23:01
Cool, thanks for answering so quickly. Coinbase lists the transaction as 'pending' saying it could take up to an hour to confirm. So much for instant gratification!
@_date: 2013-04-04 20:38:50
Looking at your post history, almost all you do is panhandle for bitcoins. Do you really think you'll get rich off the kindness of others?
@_date: 2013-04-05 20:23:54

Using a referral link and begging for donations. Classy.
@_date: 2013-04-12 15:20:13
You already have your own post looking to buy. No one will want my ~$30 if they know they can get $500 out of you. Thanks for pissing on my parade.
@_date: 2013-03-12 19:58:24
I don't think this is a good idea, at least if you're in America. Servers get paid less than minimum wage with the expectation that their tips will get them to a livable income. If I were working in food service, I'd rather leave at the end of the night with a pocketful of cash than a fraction of a BTC that could takes days to cash out. Also, if the busser gets to the table before the server, they could throw away the origami not knowing what it's for.
@_date: 2013-03-11 20:34:55
Yeah, my confirmation finally came through. Thanks again. :)
For anyone downvoting/doubting this 'casino', I vouch for its legit-ness. I won and it paid out as promised.
