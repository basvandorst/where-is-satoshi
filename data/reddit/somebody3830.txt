Sorry, this is nonsense. LN will not work. It's an ugly, complicated system with bad incentives.
@_date: 2017-12-04 22:17:57
But since 2011? Find the hard to believe. Look at gox in 2014. That was a huge dip.

If it's a virus, then it's a virus that will destroy the entire financial system and then itself due to lack of sustenance.

Crypto currency is not a bubble. Bitcoin is.

I read part of this already and it was clear that it's wrong with high fees. Here's what I wrote on twitter about it:

You're clearly a troll.
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:40:41
I do believe my opinions have empirical data to support them, but I'm not going to address all of them here because this is going to be a long response already and I think I've addressed them in various other comments I made (check my history if you're interested).


If you feel that way, then the Bitcoin project has failed to teach you anything, and you should just use banks with private blockchains. You don't need Bitcoin.




I'm not here to shill Bitcoin Cash, but I do think their scaling solution works "at least" in the short term (and I don't think Bitcoin's works long term at all). But for now, I think the best solution would be for people to start using a plethora of different alt coins. Buying alt coins helps Bitcoin by distributing the load to other chains. IMO, a chain is not valuable if it's not usable as money. Bitcoin has therefore already exceeded its utility value and it's gonna pop as is (eventually)--or alt coins can pick up the slack and absorb some more of the value (that balances out the utility-vs-value of Bitcoin and others). If value distributes evenly to alt coins, then people can at least still use crypto currency in general as money and the ecosystem can more safely grow. If Bitcoin can't handle the load and function as money, putting more value in Bitcoin is actually a rather serious security risk.
And I'm trying to educate people here. I think that is helpful. It costs me a lot of time to write these responses, but maybe some people will read them. It's a lot better than posting "Oh look how rich we all are now. Keep buying" blindly without thinking. That's incredibly irresponsible.


Think about what you're saying, because it's a contradiction. You're saying 99% of people like centralization, and so the incentive towards centralization of funds is OK. Then you're saying Bitcoin is decentralized and can't be shut down. These are mutually exclusive. We already have a system where you deposit money in some centralized institution, who settles with other large institutions. We already had a system where you could redeem gold with a promissory note. These do not work, and never have. We should not go to an abstract Bitcoin-esque version of the same thing. That's what separated Bitcoin early on (when it was usable as cash). If not everyone can use it on-chain, its on-chain security is wasted. And worse off, you're paying extra high fees for wasted security and burning massive electricity to run it. It really couldn't be a worse settlement system. It has to be money to be valuable. It has to be money to be secure. It has to be money to be censorship resistant. Every good property of Bitcoin's design is necessarily lost if it cannot be used as cash by everyone. Please try to understand this.


That is my logic. The gov't can easily shut it down at any time if it's not used by everyone. Gold was not traded by individuals, promissory notes for gold were. So the gov't says - "let's take the gold out of the equation" - and nobody can stop it because the majority of gold is in the hands of a few institutions. Replace gold with Bitcoin and we're in the same situation. The crucial value of this system is in individual financial sovereignty. That is lost if the majority cannot transact directly on chain, and are forced use promissory notes of any kind (LN included).


The rich are fine. It's the rest of society who really need this technology, and giving it to them benefits everyone. But they're the ones who most significantly suffer, and are essentially in an bizarre form of abstract slavery within the limitations of the current financial system. Bitcoin can change this, if everybody can use it--but only if that's true. Otherwise we're using an awesome technology to create system that's hardly different than before. It just sounds cooler if we're using "blockchains" though right? That's missing the whole point.

 - here's an old thread (they used to be called SynapsePay)
Their contact info should be on the site somewhere. Or some mention of their partnership or banking agreement.
I tried to login to find it for you but it takes years with Kraken. Their site just sucks and doesn't work.
You can always just send them an email though and ask if they still do Kraken's USD. If not, they'll just say no and that's the end of it.

Seriously, please stop lying. Go on blockchain.info and look for yourself.
One of the most recent transactions I found was $0.64 and the fees were $11.71. You can't make this stuff up:  - In fact, most of the small transactions I click on have huge fees. That means only the wealthy can actually use this anymore. It's great we're all rich now. yay. But this system is not going to help society, so we're basically getting rich off of the poor who are investing in this with the hopes of getting rich, too. That's a Ponzi.
Here's another recent one for a higher amount $61 and the fees $8. 
$411 with $37 in fees: 
Just go look for yourself. It's not that hard. You don't have to just blindly believe everything you read on here. Around here, you're smarter than you think. These devs are far from the geniuses they parade to be. Please do your own research and don't be afraid to see things objectively.

I use BTC often. All of my recent transactions have taken a very long time. Several of them took &gt;5 hours. The fees I paid were very high.
My most recent transaction took two hours and I paid a high fee.

Then you're either a troll or just spouting BS. FYI, I did read the FAQ, per your original suggestion and to give you benefit of the doubt. My arguments hold.
@_date: 2017-12-04 19:01:03
When Bitcoin pops it won't stop crypto currency, I agree.
@_date: 2017-12-05 16:07:56
Very true. I almost mentioned bitcoin to people who ended up robbing me about a month and a half ago for a small amount of USD. I averted a potential disaster.
This is another reason why I see little value in Bitcoin unless it's digital cash. Fees are currently preventing that. I say it has little value because the gov't has guns and can take it away from people otherwise.
@_date: 2017-12-04 21:39:05
Same. I'd rather learn than work anyway.

You can reach out to SynapseFi directly (who handles their banking). hello

Go all in on alt coins. You'll make your money back in no time.

Why don't you tell me what you think I'm missing instead of making accusations? I made some arguments, so go ahead and make your's.
@_date: 2017-12-06 14:50:45
Bitcoin is literally no different. You'll all wake up when the gov't turns it back into fiat.
Fees. are. too. high.
@_date: 2017-12-03 19:15:30
Bitcoin is not as valuable as it is today if it's a settlement system alone. Since not everyone can use it as money, most of the utility is lost. Right now the fees are too high and the price swings too rapid for it to be useful as money. Since it has high fees, it incentivizes using centralized services that can offer you nothing other than a promissory note that you own X bitcoins and can redeem them (most won't be redeemable due to fees). This kind of system has never worked. The gov't can shut down centralized services like this and we'll end up on fiat again - just like what happened with the gold standard. The only way the gov't cannot shut it down is if everybody can use it as money. Bitcoin the technology cannot be shut down, essentially, but Bitcoin the "money" can easily be shut down if most people cannot afford to use it on-chain. When that happens, it will collapse. Even if the gov't never shuts it down (ha), then it still loses most of its security benefits through the centralized services.

I'm an engineer. Read the white paper.
@_date: 2017-12-06 14:49:22
They're not scared of that anymore. That's why Wall Street is embracing this Bitcoin. Fees are already too high for everyone to use it.
@_date: 2017-12-03 14:41:41
You guys are missing the whole point. If it's just a settlement system, the gov't can easily shut it down.
Therefore, it's not a reason to buy. It would only be a reason to buy if it were usable as money by everyone. Fees are too high for that.
@_date: 2017-12-03 02:06:11
That's fallacious. I could create a settlement system made of carrots. Would you argue it's worth hundred of billions of dollars? Never had a carrot-like system.
I've been heavily involved in Bitcoin since early 2013. It was great back then. It's not the same today.
If Bitcoin is not useful as money (i.e., people all around the world trade with it for everything, especially small items), then its only value is speculative. The fees are too high for it to be money. Go on blockchain.info and look at some of the transactions. The fees are crazy. It might cost $18 to send $30. Not to mention, everything you buy with Bitcoin ends up costing you greatly - i.e., buy a microwave today for $200 and it costs you $600 in losses a few months later. That's not useful as money today.
So basically the only use is to hold and speculate. Which means new investors are paying old investors. That's the very definition of a Ponzi scheme. You could argue there is some value to the settlement system, but it's by no means hundreds of billions of dollars of value. There are much better settlement systems.
Furthermore, the high fees economically incentivize using centralized services to transact. It defeats the purpose of being decentralized in the first place. The gov't can easily shut down a system like that. But it would be difficult if not impossible for a gov't to shut down an actual "money" that everyone uses on a day to day basis.
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:48:32
I completely agree. It would be no different than using a bank to buy bank notes, because nobody is going to actually be able to afford to use the Bitcoin network themselves so the bank can't actually sell you Bitcoin, only a promissory note of Bitcoin.
Oh wait...o_O
