Good to know. My bitcoin wallet is the only sensitive data I have, and it's encrypted on a USB stick in one of those fireproof lockboxes. I'm pretty comfortable with that level of security.

Sorry, I'm confused. Was Dwolla doing anything directly with Bitcoins? The only time I've used them was to transfer USD from my bank to MtGox (where the USDs became BTCs). Is this what they're no longer going to allow? Are they not going to allow transactions involving bitcoin exchanges or did they start allowing people to store and transfer bitcoins and now they're stopping?

Interesting. But why today? And how... what's the mechanism... what happened?

I see where you're coming from on the 7200 new coins per day (50 new coins per block, 10 minutes per block), but where are you getting 1% from? From my understanding there are 7.67M bitcoins in circulation as of today. That should be a bit less than 0.1% per day... which may very well be a high rate... I don't know, off the top of my head, how to translate that to a yearly rate. Does anyone know?

I don't have a citation to back it up, but I'm pretty sure that you can be held in contempt of court (and detained) for not providing a private key to encrypted data that's been subpoenaed.

Maybe we should start an r/bitcoin hedgefund. If everyone who subscribes went in for $100 we could really mess with the market. Eh? Eh?

Damn it... I knew it would come back to bite me if I didn't look up the citation. So [here's]( 30 seconds of google work done for you. Happy new year you lazy bastard.
Edit: Granted the case doesn't say exactly what I said, and it's only a District Court decision, but it illustrates a possibly analogous situation where a 5th amendment claim was explicitly rejected.

Sorry... I should have said "market value". But yea, why the sudden adjustment towards actual value?
@_date: 2011-12-31 19:10:52
Fair enough. And sorry for calling you a lazy bastard. That blanket "we have a 5th amendment" statement just rubbed me the wrong way.
I think it's fair to say that, while we my have leanings one way or the other as to how this might play out in a higher court, this is a new, not well litigated, issue that could come out either way.
As for the hidden volume, yup, if *they* can't find it, you're in the clear. Tho I think if it became a crime to possess bitcoins, I'd probably go further and keep my wallet on a microSD card sewn into a piece of clothing or something like that...

Interesting, thanks!

Where do you find historic numbers for the network total? I haven't kept track of them, and thought 32 was pretty damn high.
And I dunno, an increase of 10THash/s over the course of less than a day... That is a lot of old rigs being powered on, and then being given up on within a day. Doesn't seem right...
