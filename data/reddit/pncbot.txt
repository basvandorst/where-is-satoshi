Probably the same. You can use that seed to restore both wallets I believe 
@_date: 2017-03-27 01:20:03
Yes you will
@_date: 2017-08-12 12:48:56
Say hello to bitcoin cash 
@_date: 2017-08-28 20:03:26
Maybe we should repost in other sub reddits ? 
@_date: 2017-08-15 10:49:56
You just need a wallet , there are open source code wallets. 
If you understand bitcoin you know you don't need banks , exchangers or whatever . 
@_date: 2017-08-28 19:47:15
Yes I am just warming people , I don't fall for this basic trick ... 
@_date: 2017-08-03 21:51:24
Localbitcoins.com 
@_date: 2017-08-29 21:26:41
With these fees ? 
@_date: 2017-08-28 19:56:32
It is a phishing site , I put some fake info and after that they ask for my email password , after that they say that site has some problem and need to wait 24-48 for login again xd 
@_date: 2017-08-13 02:06:18
Invest only what you are willing to loose. 
@_date: 2017-08-28 20:45:35
Yeah I like brave a lot but sometimes has some strange bugs that I can't figure out 
@_date: 2017-08-02 09:25:02
Proof ? Never happen to me 
@_date: 2017-11-11 01:07:17
Can you prove that ? 
@_date: 2017-11-11 01:02:02
Don't forget to buy some bitcoin and HODL for your newborn, it's wise. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 23:10:20
Easy,  they short futures , bitcoin whales make sure the price keeps high. Those morons loose money and stop. 
But I really believe that people that don't understand bitcoin and say it's a fraud will stay away from that market. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 01:15:28
Can't you see more than half volume comes from 1 Korean exchanger ? 
@_date: 2017-04-06 23:13:33
Go to localbitcoins.com - peer to peer - no need for shit institutions .
@_date: 2017-04-29 23:10:42
As far as I know if there are no confirmations after 2 or 3 days the money goes back to sender address 
@_date: 2017-04-09 03:25:40
Localbitcoins ? P2p much better 
@_date: 2017-09-07 09:14:47
You are dumb 
@_date: 2017-09-14 11:21:05
Hodl 4 ever 
@_date: 2017-09-14 17:44:42
About 8 I guess 
@_date: 2017-09-15 10:39:39
Put a buy order lower from the price you just sold. 
And start buying in chunks. Like half bitcoin every month or adjust as you see fit.

You dumb 
@_date: 2017-09-08 17:23:29
You don't mention where you bought and what method you use to transfer coins. It's obvious you just want to bash on bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-09-14 13:18:33
I understand that but still you should hold all time , it's the best way to show support and it's the most profitable. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 17:41:54
Edit. Gave stupid reply because didn't pay attention to description 
@_date: 2017-09-06 13:13:30
You can sign a transaction via SMS 
@_date: 2017-10-01 00:50:59
Yes you can , there are 2 types ( as far as I know ) of Btc ATM , 1 way and 2 way...
2 way allows to sell your btc for fiat , but last time I check 90% of volume of btc ATM are fiat to btc 
@_date: 2017-09-08 17:27:35
Well in this case it's your government fault not bitcoin ... 
@_date: 2017-09-15 08:19:57
Nothing about btc change, in fact because country like China takes btc so serious in fact increase its long term value. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 08:22:14
They being greedy because they sell now ( some days ago ) to get in at cheaper price 
@_date: 2017-09-13 11:25:42
You mean basic economic rules in a system based on debt ? 
Plus btc won't be used as currency , maybe monero will ( they have an amazing system that allows to inflation to happen ) 
Edit. Grammar 
@_date: 2017-09-14 12:58:20
Never sold ... 
@_date: 2017-09-14 17:50:51
How can it disappear ? Just hold your coins xd they will only get more valuable 
@_date: 2017-09-15 10:41:36
My country is bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-09-15 08:26:33
First of all because everyday more people use it , the coins are very limited , and probably exchangers in China will come back , and when they do expect a massive gain

They are idiots for buying GBTC instead of real bitcoins . Plus they should be prepared for volatility , if they give up so easily they should loose money

Isn't a ATM machine a middle men ? 
@_date: 2017-10-17 09:19:01
Nop , the code they use is open source. They just offer the platform , even if trezor or nano ledger ( the company's ) Just disappeared you could still access your funds 
@_date: 2017-09-13 11:18:19
You are dumb if you think bitcoin = fiat. 
You can't apply the same principle here , and we won't be here to see it but in 100 years there will be no us and no US dollar . 
@_date: 2017-10-02 22:07:26
Well this is in my country and I never heard of it , strange ... 
Will book a plane and check for myself

@_date: 2017-10-17 00:23:59
Are you stupid ? 
@_date: 2017-10-01 02:25:50
Fiat is currency created and controlled by a central government. Check Wikipedia for fiat ( not the car brand ) . 
Exemples of fiat - euro , usd aud cad usd... etc... 
@_date: 2017-09-01 22:06:11
What you consider legit money ? 
@_date: 2017-05-29 11:24:57
Not for me 
@_date: 2017-05-29 15:01:03
Well your first sentence state that we ALL want uasf, so I can't read past that 
@_date: 2017-05-29 14:13:00
Sorry you have no idea of bitcoin concept , go study more and leave this forum 
@_date: 2017-10-01 00:52:21
I know , just pointing the obvious :p
I believe btc ATM are good for newbies cause it's instant and easy to use 
@_date: 2017-05-09 10:45:03
Just hold , eventually it will go back up 
@_date: 2017-05-28 17:47:04
Buy on localbitcoins 
@_date: 2017-05-25 23:38:50
Maybe someone with a lot of bitcoin just change it on that specific exchanger? 
@_date: 2017-05-29 11:31:10
Nothing will happen on 1st August, at least nothing relevant . 
@_date: 2017-05-29 15:29:41
"Our network" ? I don't think bitcoin has a owner 
@_date: 2017-05-29 14:10:14
Just don't do anything . Won't happen anything on 1st august , people miss the concept of bitcoin .

@_date: 2017-05-29 14:57:33
Wtf are you talking about ? This is the problem , you make judgment on me and you don't even know me . don't listen to people ... get to your conclusions and do what you believe in ... 
@_date: 2017-05-29 00:40:20
Don't think so 
@_date: 2017-05-06 14:49:19
First ? What about xaurum ?
@_date: 2017-05-29 15:45:46
I don't think he owns anything , bitcoin is free spirit and it will always find a way to adjust 
@_date: 2017-05-29 14:55:28
Btc is pow , got a problem start mining . I support satoshi whitepaper , freedom from government and corrupt institutions . Where is people there is corruption. 
Maybe price will drop a bit because of this non sense , Just hope that people that need bitcoin to survive don't get affected .

There is no lowest , you can buy a fraction of a bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-06-12 02:51:41
Well bitcoin isn't a company ... isn't owned by a particular group of humans. Bitcoin will change the world one way or another . 
@_date: 2017-06-02 02:39:45
Get a trezor 
@_date: 2017-06-03 02:14:48
Lightcoin? 
@_date: 2017-06-01 11:27:34
That's why you save your coins with yourself and not on an exchanger 
@_date: 2017-06-20 23:27:20
Localbitcoins?
