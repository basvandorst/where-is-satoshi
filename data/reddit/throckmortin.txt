..And I mean that I don't voluntarily pay. I must pay but not because I choose to.
I understand your frustration but please attempt to understand mine. I take the definition of the word _voluntary_ very seriously, and I believe you do others a disservice using it in that way. I know that you pay taxes voluntarily and I believe that, but you can not include others in your worldview. You pay "voluntary" taxes so that you will be left alone and not taken to jail. I pay mandatory taxes (extortion fees) so that I will be left alone and not taken to jail.
Your view is just far different than mine and I think it yours is dangerously misled.

Does voting for a human being suddenly make them ethical or are they the same exact human being that is obsessed with earning _the dirty word_ profit?

Fair enough. I appreciate your responses anyway. I dont think any degree of tax is beneficial because I see it as theft. There is nothing about a State that allows it to indulge in any morally prohibited activity. Why can a State agent take money from people but you are called a thief if you do? The answer is difficult because it does not exist. The State is an out of control mafia. At least you've been fairly civil which is more than I can say for most of reddit. Thank you

Character assassination

Of course, I disagree. I respect the people and materials that have made my life livable, as any rational human does. 
I think you are horribly mistaken when you say (essentially) "taxes collected by the State have made my life livable." I understand _why you_ think the State "makes your life livable" but have you really tried to understand _why I_ think the State makes my life worse?

And _driven by profit_ has become a dirty phrase in our culture EVEN THOUGH profits are a sign that a business is providing an efficient service that people actually want. No, a corporation in its current form is not the economic result of a free market.

Have you ever considered how many bribes and murders it takes to have a "State authority?" It could be a free government, but some (company) will still want to be in control. That or a government in the West that floods the opium market.

If you think taxes are voluntary see what happens next year if you don't pay them. I'm not saying you are wrong about forced taxation in virtual currencies, but taxes are not voluntary by any stretch of the definition.

This is your answer, op.
Clarification edit.

The problem is that banks almost always write the regulations.
@_date: 2015-04-12 13:57:41
This is perfect.
@_date: 2015-04-19 15:08:23
I'm not sure if you do....

We don't take kindly to folks not taking kindly to our regulation-hate 'round 'ere. You can just get out.
