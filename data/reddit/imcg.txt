The issue is... I asked a simple question and 3/4th of the replies were a variant of "noob" or "GTFO" I plan on swing trading crypto currencies.  I haven't spent a single penny on crypto nor do I plan on it. It's just for the possibility.

i would agree with your statement if i said OMG ALL THE CRYPTOCURRENCIES ARE PLUMMETING!!! then it would be akin if i went to /r investing and said OMG the stockmarket is crashing. in this particular instance i asked about a specific RECENT EVENT about ONE currency. and i see doge going places if this is how the community acts when newcomers come with questions.

I'm not trying to auto so I'm just trying to trade in some casino coins for bitcoins and then trade for US dollars but its telling me I need a full Bitcoin order to make the transaction from the coin to US dollars
