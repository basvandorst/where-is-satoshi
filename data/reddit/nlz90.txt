When people say steep learning curve, does that mean it's easier?  ��
@_date: 2018-01-01 17:20:36
Perhaps, or maybe there is no such word as analystics in the first place...
@_date: 2018-01-01 17:16:35
No, it should be easier, if your x axis is effort and your y axis is knowledge.  
  
So if you have a steep learning curve, that means you gain "big" amount of knowledge by putting relatively less effort...  
  
Trust me I'm an analyst, doing analysistics for a living..
@_date: 2018-01-01 20:52:44
That's not what they mean by steep learning curve, they actually mean the graph of a learning curve.  
@_date: 2017-12-06 08:45:23

I think it's better to own a bitcoin then not own any bitcoin in the crazy shit world we live in.  
  
Look at Turkey, Iran and Venezuela.  
  
You will never know, in what situation you will end up in or what price will bitcoin climb to.  
  
In that sense it's worth to invest a bit in it and then just forget about it.

Serious question, why ain't they using crypto?
@_date: 2018-10-31 10:49:27
Do you remember 1 year ago, when bitcoin broke ATH every mouth?  
  
Ahhhh, good times..
@_date: 2019-03-12 16:06:40
Before that...
@_date: 2017-08-06 14:49:29
Yeah but just because something is rare doesn't mean it's worth much.  
Plus bitcoin can be imitated.  
So there is nothing really special about it.  
Right now there is a frenzy for bitcoin, more and more people are hearing that bitcoin tripled it's value in one year and they want to make a profit from it and that's what makes its value rise, the speculation itself.  
If bitcoin reaches a price that it's to explore to buy it then why not just make another altcoin to trade it.  
Right now we are at the amidst of the speculation, and it a long living one, which I don't think will last for ever.
@_date: 2017-08-05 09:42:29

:/

I speak more languages then you ever will..
@_date: 2017-08-08 07:26:36
To be honest this is more logical thing to do.  
Have two ways of investing, buying cheap and selling high in every opportunity, and another strategy where you buy and hold for the long run.  
So if you were like to invest 10k$ in bitcoin, invest another 10k$ which you will hold, and with the first you"lol invest.    
I need to buy some bitcoin someday.
@_date: 2017-08-19 19:42:20
What dip? It's still 4000$.

Is number 3 a product of the singling method fork?  
Or is it new currency altogether that wants to exploit the fork?
@_date: 2017-08-13 07:34:45
It's not about just the possibility of war breaking out.  
The fact that there is tension is bad for the markets.  
In economics, if there are expectations of an inflation, then there is going to be inflation, and people(maybe big sharks) want to hold on their money's value so they put it on bitcoin because every other currency will be affected.  
Bitcoin can't be affected for war negatively because it's crypto, it's not like the dollar which will suffer if a war breaks out.  
That's my opinion at least.
@_date: 2017-08-27 11:28:50
Your question is good because it really helps illustrate the problem.  
I might be willing to spend on a vacation 13k$ if it's a long trip or as little as 250$ if it just a short one.  
Part of me want to make decent returns and not play around to much but the other part says it will be better to average it out through time(but then if the price will go up I will lose some of the potential yields).  
Right now I'm in a place where even though I don't make as much as money as I would like, I'm in no way short for it, I don't do with it much.
@_date: 2017-08-27 10:51:40
Lol, OK.  
I have major in economics, I'd say I know a thing or two about money.

@_date: 2017-08-15 11:48:55
Yeah I know, I just can't find it on my Wallet.  
I was thinking using the mobile Wallet to by small chunks of bitcoin and then I can transfer those to my PC Wallet with no fees right? And maybe after accumulating enough store those on them hard drive wallets.  
But is there a fee to transfer from a private Wallet to the next?
@_date: 2017-08-24 05:24:55
Can some please explain in plain English what does this means?  
@_date: 2017-08-27 13:05:10
Sadly I'm not, but It's called a back packing trip, you save for it for few years and just do it. 
@_date: 2017-08-20 12:05:41
I hope so.  When it first reached 3000 it dropped down to 2400$.  
But the past don't really mean nothing regarding the future.

I wasn't talking about this specific article.
@_date: 2017-08-15 10:04:42
Yeah, it kinda obvious.  
I hope the price drops down drastically soonish
@_date: 2017-08-15 11:38:11

I have Xapo as a Wallet with no funds on it what so ever.  
Where do I get this "seed" thing?  Is it the address of the Wallet you send money to?
@_date: 2017-08-02 08:58:06
So as of right now there are two coins?
@_date: 2017-08-17 06:14:55
Why this sub is cult like that it rejects any kind of criticism on bitcoin?  
We are all speculating here that BTW value of bitcoin will go up.     
Why can't you just accept criticism on bitcoin?  
Because it hurt your feelings and you feel judged in you actions?  
@_date: 2017-08-15 12:29:42
So it's better off to buy with one Wallet.  
What kind would be most recommend?  PC? Smartphone? Hard-drive?
@_date: 2017-08-13 06:35:50
I'm with you on this one, I think about buying small chunks and average it out, or wait for it until it drops.
@_date: 2018-06-25 09:49:07
It has a value in that that it is a way to send funds relatively fast.  
  
Sending fiat funds from my bank to a trading market for bitcoin for example, can take up to 2 days, relative to 10 minutes with bitcoin.

You made a profit? Good for you.
@_date: 2017-09-29 14:29:48
Yeah but you can be pleasantly surprised even more if you invested more on 4000$.  
  
If a person bought some at 4000$ and it drops to 100$ he can buy it again at with the same amount and the first investment wont even affect him after it raises again. 
@_date: 2017-09-29 12:40:11
If it's gonna increase 20 more then it is. But if it's gonna decrease in half it's not.

No it is not.

Well any store value can be used as a transaction.  
  
I think it can be a store value, without a problem.  
Think about South Korea.  
A Korean can buy bitcoin if there is a war and thus protect himself against is own money being devalued, in case where a war breaks out/tension raise.   
It's easy, it's not like gold where you need a space to store it, and it can easily be moved out of the country.

Congratulations, you just made an  complete and utter fool of yourself.    
I wasn't talking at all about what your odds are. And of course they don't change with every other toss.  
But the law of large numbers has nothing to do with it.    
I said that the law if large numbers only **apply** when you have multiple trails:  
  
"The law of large numbers is a principle of probability according to which the frequencies of events with the same likelihood of occurrence even out, ***given enough trials or instances***.". 
  
In this op's case he didn't have multiple trails he had only **one**.    
And what I'm saying is that you are an idiot to make that bet if you only have one trail.  
 
I did take statistics class, the only difference between you and me is that I actually understood what was being taught for a change.  
@_date: 2017-09-02 12:10:03
Yes but you can lose a decent amount of money if it's just one time thing.  
It's bad idea to satiate something that is only one time trial with expected mean.

I can't hodl since I did bought bitcoin before, hope it goes the other way down for a while.

Nope.  
Like any other of its kind in history, bitcoin is speculation. And will be for at least the next 100 years.  
You can make profit from speculating of course, but make no mistake, you are speculating.

You can do anything these days....can't you?
@_date: 2017-06-06 15:41:54
See you at 6
@_date: 2017-06-06 09:19:46
There is no relations between the two.  
Saying bitcoin can't be currency has nothing to do with its price.

Once, Back in the days bitcoin was new, I almost bought some.  
True story.    
@_date: 2017-06-06 05:52:40
This is gonna burst really really bad...I hope. 
@_date: 2017-06-27 19:58:42
Seriously as someone who is new to all this what good is a currency if you can'y be sure it transfers to your wallet safely? bitcoin has big problems to be worth investing in it.
@_date: 2018-12-07 08:48:02
Yet your still here....lol
@_date: 2017-06-12 10:55:33
Oh yeah how do you know this Mr.prophet?
@_date: 2017-06-15 05:57:39
I want to buy but don't know how.  
Is there any difference what kind of Wallet do I choose?  
What if I buy through some site, will I pay fees every now and then?  
@_date: 2017-06-16 13:26:59
Posts like these are what makes me to dissociate myself with this subreddit. 
@_date: 2017-06-03 18:21:51
I hope it plummets drastically so I can buy some for the first time.  
@_date: 2017-06-20 09:09:02
Passed performance don't mean nothing regarding the future.  
Speculation much.
@_date: 2018-12-07 06:53:28
Lol most of the people here that are commenting don't have even 2000$ in bitcoin
@_date: 2017-06-07 07:03:59
Yes but there is no way in hell you can know if bitcoin is gonna be a shitcoin 6 months from now.

So basically you guys are just gambling, might as well go to the casino play blackjack or Russian roulette.
