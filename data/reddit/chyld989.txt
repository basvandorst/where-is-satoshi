Is...is that really funny enough that it caused you to laugh out loud? 
@_date: 2018-01-29 19:04:21
Ahh, I suppose that could be found as funny. I always marvel when people release apps on just iOS, personally. If you're not going to release the app on both systems (or at least not on both at launch), why would you pick the one that only covers &lt; 20% of the market? 
@_date: 2018-01-29 18:59:24
Out of curiosity, what makes it funny to you? Maybe I'm missing something, but I don't see a joke in there. 
@_date: 2018-01-29 19:32:58
I would strongly disagree with that Hyundai/Ferrari comparison, but I've always been an Android guy. With the exception of the first release or two and a couple features here and there, Android always seems a couple years ahead of iOS (after which Apple will say they created this brand new feature that nobody else has, which reminds me that their blatant lying had always dissuaded me from their products too).
Not trying to convince you to change your mind though. Having some people prefer Android and some prefer iOS is what has helped push both OS's as far as they've come. 
@_date: 2018-01-29 21:01:46
Weird that you found Android to be more buggy. I remember reading a report a handful of years ago talking about how iOS apps crashed more frequently than their Android counterparts, but everyone has slightly different experiences.
As for Android being ahead, here are some features Android had before iOS (some are still exclusive to my knowledge):
Notification shade
Custom keyboards
Being able to set custom apps as defaults (don't open Safari when I click a link, open Chrome)
Grouped notifications
Multiple users
Smart unlock
Back button
Many new features are built as apps instead of built directly into the OS itself, so even if your phone doesn't get the update you'll still get a decent amount of the new features rather than being forced to upgrade. 
That's all just software (aside from the back button, which is now just software). There's also:
Multiple phone sizes (Apple always said "People don't want bigger phones" while people were constantly begging them for a bigger phone)
Water/dust resistance
Wireless charging
Fast charging
Haptic feedback
At least some of these things definitely came out on third party phones/custom OS's, but I think that's just another pro in Android's column.
I also think iOS is incredibly unintuitive and think things on Android are far more likely to just work the way they're supposed to, but to each their own.

iOS (as of about 12 months ago).

Is...is that really funny enough that it caused you to laugh out loud? 
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:06:31
Yeah, definitely not the same. This is more like if I was telling people to keep reading magazines because how else are magazines supposed to make money!?
But I'm not, I'm just saying that websites are put up for free because they're able to make money from the ads. But you are saying that it doesn't matter if that's how they make money, you're choosing to steal the content and they have to accept that because you're too entitled to recognize the difference. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:31:43
Weird! I've literally never had that happen on Facebook. Are you just using the mobile site, or the actual app?
I have no problem with those methods of supporting sites, but if it's not a group or person set up to do a subscription (either through their own site or through something like Patreon) it becomes harder. I don't want to have to find an email for them to ask about donating when I can just not go through the extra effort of blocking their ads.
I do appreciate sites with ads that aren't obstructing the purpose of the site! 
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:54:07
And again, I prefer to support the sites I visit. Sites are able to stay alive because if the ads on their pages. If everyone blocks the ads how do the sites make enough money to keep generating content? 
@_date: 2017-12-14 00:55:21
I suppose I've seen hyperbolic quotes before, and now that you say they're "Chan-style" I suppose it makes sense, but sadly I never would have come up with that on my own. Sorry. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:41:27
Weird. I use the actual app too (Android) and occasionally go on there on my PC, but haven't run into that. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:19:00
Hardy Har Har (why did my phone capitalize 'Har'?). Once again you're taking something that isn't at all like what we're talking about and pretending that it's the same as what we're talking about. Shows how weak your argument is. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 01:01:59
I hope that they all know who the douche was that caused the site to go down so they can be shamed for their douchebaggery. It's not a real thing man, no need to get bent out of shape. I'm just saying I hope these assholes someday get some sort of karmic retribution, because otherwise they're just going to go around and think that this behavior is acceptable. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 01:52:27
Yeah, see, you're the type of person I hate because you think you're entitled to block ads even though that's what makes your entertainment possible. I hope someday you learn that you're being an asshole by blocking all ads. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:17:00
That can be your opinion, but I recommend people pay for the things they like, otherwise the things they like will disappear.
And maybe I'm alone here, but I've never seen a video ad in the middle of another video on Facebook. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:11:05
Of course there is, the fact that the ads exist, and sites without ads either require paying, donating, or going out of business due to the fact that giving things away is not a viable business model. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 03:09:37
Just hope you realize that makes you an asshole. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:56:51
That's...not even remotely close to the same thing. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:13:44
It's only a broken revenue scheme because people like you think you're too good to pay for the things you want, so you steal them instead. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 03:09:02
They are paying you, the content on the website is your payment. Like I said, you taking that content without "paying" them by viewing the ads makes you an asshole. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 00:53:54
Don't get me wrong, I hope the people involved in the sites all get fantastic dream job offers afterwards so they aren't affected negatively, but when people have a blatant disregard for how their actions negatively affect others (in this case stealing content) then yeah, I want them to get the short end of the stick. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 16:59:26
Oh man, don't know how I misread that so badly. My bad.
But this still isn't the same thing at all. Websites are free because they can show ads. This is a fact. You're entering into an agreement with the websites that you'll view the ads in exchange for the content on the website. You're being an asshole by blocking their one form of revenue (other than charging a subscription, which I'm sure you still wouldn't pay since you're clearly an entitled asshole).
And I clearly don't do anything I'm told, as people have told me to use an ad blocker and I tell them to fuck off. I'm sorry if the fact that I want to support the content I enjoy offends you, which it clearly has. It's the same reason that I buy my TV shows and music rather than pirating them: without being paid for what they do they'll stop doing what they do.
It's such a simple concept that I don't understand why you're having such a hard time grasping it. Even my four year old niece would understand it. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 03:43:47
What the fuck are you even taking about? How is showing you an ad in exchange for you viewing their content them raping babies? 
@_date: 2017-12-12 14:16:55
So it's nothing like raping babies and you're admitting your comment made no sense? Good to hear. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:52:17
Who do you think you're quoting, since I never said anything about anyone's heritage?
Also, I haven't downvoted a singled one of your comments, so you're probably getting downvoted by the same person that has up voted a few of my comments. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:51:04
I prefer to support the sites I visit, so I don't run an ad blocker, and recommend nobody else does either. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:00:56
Then I hope that every site you enjoy goes out of business due to people like you that refuse to support them. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:44:13
Anyone that steals is an asshole, that's a fairly well established fact that is accepted by the vast majority of people in the vast majority of situations. You're the one that's deluded enough to think that what you're doing isn't stealing. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:08:06
Yep, but I can also just not go to sites that have shitty ads, and my firewall/virus scan has blocked me from getting any malware type stuff for the past decade plus. If there's any sites I find that are terrible beyond belief I just completely block them in my hosts file. 
@_date: 2018-04-16 20:30:53
Fun! I especially like the moon I drove past at the ATH.
