Was reading about it on the couch one morning and bought 200 coins for around $10. Thought it was the neatest thing, bank didn't agree and stopped the transaction. Didn't buy back in till recently.
Bought it cause I thought what it was and could do was the future.
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:28:12
I set a buy order for 13k a week or so ago while it shot up. Finally got me some coin lol.

I tried to buy about 200 coins in 2013 for around $2,000 but my bank stopped it. By the time my account was allow to make foreign transaction it had jumped to a couple 100 and I thought I had missed the boat. Things happened and I just didn't have the money to risk till about now. It hurts to look at the price these days. I do have very good humor about it, tell my friends I'm still a millionaire on the inside lol. I recently started to buy coin, it's much easier now I can say that!

But avocados can only be spread naturally by extinct megafauna. This will lead to centralization as the seeds get too big and expensive to transport around. It'll be susceptible to attack by disease and not a true decentralized pizza.
Pineapple is becoming even more decentralized from it's early island roots and can be pollinated by even hummingbirds! You also can't deny the amount of wasted space inside on avocados that is not an issue with pineapple.
Pineapples are for everyone, avocados for the already wealthy. Stop spreading FUD!

There was a bug with spending an input twice in the same block. It would allow it if confirmed in the same block.
Edit: newer nodes at the time wouldn't reject the block while older nodes would and it would've split the chain.

I was being sarcastic haha. They used to cut coins into pieces and the pizza analogy is spot on. 6/6 &amp; 8/8 are still 1.000000 &amp; 1.00000000. Their head might explode if they found out about the LN and the 1e-3 Sat.

If I have a thousand miners and only need three to run on the minor chain without going over 51% I can leave 997 on the main chain until I want to attack the minor.
Could also assign miners to other pools to make it seem more decentralized.

@_date: 2018-06-01 04:01:48
I find it terrifying to think about. Are they hiding their overall hash rate in other pools?
@_date: 2018-06-06 16:12:49
I use it regularly for BTC. You get control over the BTC instantly and can transfer to a wallet usually within the next block. When buying there is a 1% markup, but no fee for transferring.
Get $5 for using a referral link from someone. I'll send mine to anyone interested.
@_date: 2018-06-06 18:52:58
Also no fees
@_date: 2019-10-28 08:24:02
Be there or be square
@_date: 2018-06-05 13:15:01
It gives you a common base that you can now adjust variables. 
An example would be, hmm what if it was BCH that was with 7x more USD. How much would that fee be?
What if they were with the same USD?
Now you can imagine what people would be complaining about if BCH was around BTC's December high with it's fees.
@_date: 2019-10-28 08:06:11

My node transaction count is at 1318 right now after two months. It's not a big node, less than 0.33 BTC out bound cap and 0.5 in.
For a couple weeks it was doing 25+ sats in fees worth a day. My fee is very low.

The coinjoin? I'm not sure.
@_date: 2019-06-21 03:58:48
I'll just use yours if true.
@_date: 2019-02-07 16:51:45
Only anecdotal evidence I can give is that my node is up to 1,100 transactions routed over a few months. Picked up tremendously in the last month.
@_date: 2019-12-14 05:18:08
Took you awhile
@_date: 2019-12-16 12:25:11
I'm more pointing at nodes and not miners. Miners don't care about size. Storing the chain on your own node will be over. No more trustless.
@_date: 2019-12-15 21:34:12
The cars would be cheaper.
@_date: 2019-12-17 11:34:57
Usually because they know that they don't know everything and can't know what the other person knows. Best not to set yourself up to look stupid by being called out.
@_date: 2019-12-16 02:01:00
Those blocks would be about 1 GB each. 144 GB/day and they'll centralize quick in 6 months.
@_date: 2019-12-16 01:47:22
The dollar would buy more because it would have more value. An example would be that a sorts car in the 80s was $3k.
@_date: 2019-04-13 02:54:25
Feel like there is ice in your stomach?
@_date: 2019-04-11 15:29:17
Because all Bitcoin can be traced there are bitcoins monitored from hacks/thefts. If you were to receive one of these and didn't know the illicit origin, you'd not be able to move it to an exchange without it being seized. That 1 BTC is now worth 0 BTC to you.
@_date: 2019-04-13 19:58:51
Current rates on LN are about 1 sat per 0.01 BTC. The competition for routing is fierce.
@_date: 2019-04-23 17:08:49
On-chain or lightning?
@_date: 2019-04-11 15:33:48
Robinhood doesn't let you so far.
@_date: 2019-12-15 21:13:42
That's currently $1.25/block @ $0.0004 tx fee. Would take about 3mil tx/block to equal BTC fee reward.
@_date: 2019-04-11 15:56:57
I can't answer much of that except from my experience. Cashapp banned my account because I transferred some BTC to an address linked to a gambling site despite me never gambling. I'm sure to keep that tx separate from my main wallet just in case now.
@_date: 2019-04-11 17:09:17
I couldn't say, but it sure makes it hard to verify the BTC is actually there.
@_date: 2019-04-11 16:01:03
Knowingly selling tracked coins p2p without the other party knowing is just a dick move. You've just passed the buck. I'd say open a LN channel with it and never close it. The spending on ln is private.
@_date: 2019-04-23 17:13:30
Thought it could also be done with an isotope of Mercury and a nuclear reactor.

@_date: 2018-11-30 03:25:57
Thought I was looking at two chains at first. Are there more pages to explore?
@_date: 2018-11-06 05:20:59
That was my thinking, but I don't want to risk being stuck with either as every one dumps them.
@_date: 2018-11-28 18:22:50
I fear it's a bounce and am holding to see where it goes. Bought plenty on the way down.
@_date: 2018-11-29 03:06:23
Buy orders for Tuesday, thanks
@_date: 2018-11-27 20:44:38
Mine knows not ask about it haha, she knows what happened to the 200 BTC I had bought years ago.
@_date: 2018-11-25 15:06:03
Only played with what I could lose and I want to see how low it can go. Can I make 1BTC lightning channels soon?
@_date: 2018-11-25 11:28:37
Time to buy more to get my exposure back up.
@_date: 2018-11-18 09:24:04
My transactions are usually $0.008. using Segwit if that matters.
If I use my lightning channel its less than a Satoshi.
@_date: 2018-11-27 20:38:14
It's all just IOUs representing the only thing real, each other's time and effort. My time and effort for your time and effort.

True, very wasteful.

Care to explain what the dual citizenship has anything to do with it so it isn't assumed you have xenophobia?
Keep in mind I'm from the south and bigotry is an assumed attribute for us. I knows it when I sees it.
Edit: removed my edit of "Next will be your homophobia."
You did that without the edit.

Yet such a small fly rattles you so, why do you suppose?

Never made it that far.
@_date: 2018-07-19 15:56:22
I never stopped.
But we've moved into attacking each other so it's clear this is over. Just thought you might know something I didn't.

He got you good!
@_date: 2018-07-19 17:39:10
I edited in the Bitcoin bit as it became apparent it wasn't the assumed topic. We're in the Bitcoin sub! If we were in any other sub dealing with politics I would've never started the comment chain. I've been reading up on the issue and we have a lot of dual citizenship senators.
Thank you for your break down, though still doesn't address what his dual citizenship status has to do with Bitcoin.

Beat my bf. Thought you established that.
@_date: 2018-07-19 17:17:47
And you're the first to actually start to address why it's an issue. Though I still feel that's too much of a blanket ban. What if they're our ambassador to the country they're a dual citizen to before moving to office?
Still doesn't address what it has to do with Bitcoin.
Edit: added last sentence when I realized we seemed to be arguing different points.
@_date: 2018-07-19 16:51:46

Probably anywhere from 2-7 sats, I've had 0 sats before. My channels are set to free. I only notice they're used because the local and remote channel balances shift while I stay at 0 sats collected.

Cashapp, Gemini, Coinbase, or local Bitcoins would be places to start for buying.

The problem is you don't know when the dump is coming. It could be minutes after it starts to pump. You have to sell while it's still climbing or you have no one to sell to on the way down.
