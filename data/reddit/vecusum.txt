Two hearings in both the Senate Banking Committee and the Homeland Security Committee (no link is on more than 1 word) featuring input from representatives from most major law enforcement and financial regulatory agencies who have been asked to assess and explain digital currencies, specifically crypto-currencies, and their impacts on law enforcement and financial regulation  in tandem with a analysis by the head of the Fed, the Chicago Fed, the SEC, and the DoJ being publicly released all within days of each other.
That's more or less the definition of the us government putting both  legislative and economic focus on a topic. Certainly the fact that all of this happened in the last two weeks *has* had a large impact on why we've seen so many economists publish opinions on this particular topic recently.

It recently became a topic of focus for usgov and their economic analysts who tend to fit in a particular school of economics that values the government backing and monetary controls of fiat currencies more than really any other metric of currency control and have a tendency to dismiss them.
Most people don't have a real understanding of points of contention in economics between schools, such as the value of government involvement, and the super simple version taught in high school, like with a number of other subjects involving government action, sells the current model above other models. That reflects in some of the comments you see on those threads.
It's not surprising that a lot of people with a penchant to prefer the current model are going to read and see economics advisers in the camp that tends to get more prominence from government work (and thus have more sale-able resumes in review arenas) and have a bias towards trusting their views.
