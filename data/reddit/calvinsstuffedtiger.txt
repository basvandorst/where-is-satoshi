I think That was a different situation entirely.  The bitcoin hardfork was to fix a critical bug in the code
In my opinion The DAO was a hardfork to reverse a hack because the people in charge of the DAO were friends with people in the ethereum foundation and people in the ethereum foundation were heavily involved in the DAO as well.  Also the hardfork was done because the foundation didn’t want a huge amount of ETH under control of a bad actor in the event ethereum moved to Proof of Stake 
The DAO fork was also done without consensus as many miners and the exchanges didn’t want the fork to happen (as evidenced by ETH Classic existing)

To be fair at the moment all crypto and to a much lesser degree bitcoin is kind of a natural Ponzi 
There are two components to a Ponzi: 1) the underlying investment has no utility/doesn’t exist/etc and 2) New investor money is used to pay older investors 
The key point in this argument is the   Bitcoiners will say bitcoin does have utility.  Nocoiners will say it doesn’t 
This is an impasse that neither party will ever cross over so there’s no point wasting breath. 
The question I would ask is: if bitcoin is a Ponzi then what do they call venture capital investing in tech companies? 
The businesses have little to no physical assets.  The apps themselves have dubious value.  And their existence is primarily to make the early investors rich by dumping the shares on the public market

No one is talking about gold and silver.  The article is about the advantage of spending with bitcoin instead of cash and I’m saying it’s really hard to spend bitcoin in the places I’d normally spend cash.  As it stands now I have two different use cases for cash and bitcoin.  Bitcoin for online stuff and cash for meatspace.  Hell I can’t even send bitcoin to any of my friends to settle debts, but Venmo is ubiquitous (one the main reasons I think bitcoin cash can’t win).   
Online transactions obviously bitcoin is better than everything since credit card fees are expensive etc etc.  But in my daily life walking down the street doing my errands I’ve never been to a place that would accept bitcoin, and I bet the author of the article hasn’t either
Also spending bitcoin in a brick and mortar or peer to peer transaction doesn’t make a lot of sense because of the confirmation time.  Am I supposed to make the purchase and then wait 10 minutes in the store before I can leave? Or does the store owner take zero confirmation transactions? 
So yeah, again, love bitcoin.  But it’s not even close to replacing cash yet. 
And yes I’m fully immersed and aware of the lightning network before someone chimes in with “but lightning will solve this problem”

Yeah the fusion tech thing is dumb but an unmeasured amount of bitcoin mining is done at facilities that literally would have wasted the energy.  And due to the high cap x of mining facilities and the reliance on cheap electricity I bet mining will consolidate to areas like hydroelectric dams, natural gas facilities, wind, geothermal etc. 
Again, at all of these places excess energy is always produced and always wasted.  This is one way of capturing that value.
I think the energy consumption narrative with bitcoin is overblown, especially if bitcoin achieves its mission of being sound money.  That mission is worth 10x more energy expenditure

Bitcoin is a revelation in the Philippines. You have to keep in mind that it is a country where cash is king.  There are few credit cards, few contracts (because people are so corrupt there they will just walk away and take your money), and a large portion of the economy is from overseas workers sending money back home
Before Bitcoin western union could charge up to 10% of every dollar to send money back home.
Now you can do it for free.  All that extra money is going back into the hands of the locals. Now they are cutting out more middle men by opening up the ways people can spend Bitcoin which is the progress the poster is talking about .
When smart contracts become a thing you will see it used extensively in the Philippines. I can only dream of a time when contracts can be made that take the human element out of the equation . 
Also pick pocketing is rampant in Manila so not having cash on you is a huge plus as well. Everything about Bitcoin is awesome for Filipinos

There was also that netflix documentary on dirty money that painted Ackman in a super negative light as being part of the collapse of a major pharmaceutical player that literally went to zero.  Ironically the activist investors that shorted that stock were right and made a killing against Ackman.
It was actually kind of funny seeing two high quality documentaries on Netflix. One painting Ackman as this robin hood figure standing up for mexicans.  And the other painting Ackman as a villain who is subsidizing the price gouging of people with life threatening illnesses and no other treatment options. 
It's amazing what editing can do to the narrative of a person.

Not the PP, but I highly recommend A random walk down Wall Street, Black Swan, Fooled by Randomness , and Predictably Irrational (for some more human psychology stuff)
You will start to see that things like bitcoin , though seemingly revolutionary in the moment could be the greatest thing since sliced Jesus , or it could just be a flash in the pan. I say this as a massive massive crypto fan .
After you read those books you’ll start to see why it makes sense to only speculate with 5-10% of your net worth.  Five on the safe side and 10+ if you are young and/or are very risk tolerant and have a steady 6-figure plus income 
So many people have their life savings into crypto or gold or silver and it gives me fucking anxiety

In my opinion It definitely threatens the status quo but not in the way that most people in the community think so.
I feel like bitcoin as a payment processor is like the worst fucking idea ever.  Everyone compares it to visa but imagine if you had to locally store every single visa transaction in the world.  That’s dumb and horribly inefficient.
The revolutionary thing that BTC did that is disrupting the world is it offered a tradable currency for oppressed and underserved people like: drug dealers, prostitutes, gamblers, citizens of dictatorships, etc etc which is a HUGE market
I remember hearing a planet money episode where they talked about the market cap of the hidden dark economy to be in the trillions of dollars

My feeling is that we want absolutely every one possible associated with bitcoin.  Right now imho, bitcoin is not truly a "currency" in the sense that it is not "generally accepted or in use."  Bitcoins legitimacy as a currency will be when you are able to exchange bitcoins for any and all physical goods.  Right now I look at bitcoins as more of a commodity, something we are speculating a value of, but really dont know...because people aren't trading it for physical goods on the scale that would allow us to compare it to other currencies.  
Pirates like Cody Wilson legitimize bitcoin in an equally valuable way as a mega-huge company like Overstock.com accepting bitcoins for products.  Both are creating marketplace where you can trade bitcoins for physical goods without any imposition by the federal government. I hope they both succeed and inspire others to do the same.

What city are you in?
If it were me and I had unlimited time I would find an area that is densely populated with stores that have super low margins think coffee shops, clothing stores, mom and pop repair stores, etc.  Then go door to door selling them on how bitcoin via coinbase will eliminate their payment processing fees up to 2 million a year, and convince them to pass some of the saving on to their customers with special bitcoin only deals.
Once you get enough interest, buy a bitcoin atm and plunk it down somewhere in the middle of the stores, cross your finger, and hope people adopt it.  
That kind of grass roots level adoption is something the community is seriously lacking in, and something that imho is essential for the success of bitcoin. 
Airbnb, uber, foursquare, all these apps that are household names didn't just arrive with that market penetration, they hustled door to door in the beginning. 
I think bitcoiners don't realize how much ground level work needs to be done for bitcoin to have a chance at being ubiquitous as a payment gateway
@_date: 2014-05-10 17:50:36
Yes.  This.  I don't really understand why the u.s. hasn't started transitioning to this system.  It will keep people from storing all their money off-shore.  And EVERY ONE will start paying taxes.  Stay at home moms, 9-5ers, cops, senators, drug dealers, prostitutes.  Everybody has to buy physical goods.  
Put a VAT on all physical goods in the u.s., with a smaller VAT on goods produced in the u.s.  Eliminate this federal income tax nonsense.  Allow states to have income taxes if necessary, give them the power to delegate state resources since it is much easier to throw people out of office at the state level than the federal level.  
Tl:DR a VAT means everybody pays taxes.  The current tax system just makes rich people dodge taxes.  Bitcoins is now a medium for poor people to dodge taxes as well.  Bad news for the u.s. unless they adapt.

As of now yes.  And there is a fairly strong suspicion in the community that they are using their customers hardware to mine under the guise of "burning in" the hardware, and citing production delays as the reason for the shipping delays (they told us quarter 2 during the pre order phase. Then said it was quarter 2 to 3.  And now it's the end of the 3rd quarter and still no miners), but really they are just waiting for the difficulty to increase before actually shipping it out.  
so I'm crossing my fingers but not very hopeful.  
@_date: 2014-10-16 21:08:54

God there are so many retards in this thread it's unbelievable.  Rebit.ph doesn't send bitcoins per se to people in the PI.  They automatically convert it to pesos or USD charging 1% iNV fees, and they have courier services that hand delivers the cash to our families for a whopping $4 USD in extra fees.   
For those keeping track that means it's cheaper than western union, paypal, and you can do it all online.  So no it doesn't matter that people aren't using bitcoin because our families get cash on the other end, and it doesn't matter what their volume is because it doesn't affect you.
All i know is that my family doesn't have to get stuck in traffic for two hours driving to the mall, or risk getting robbed on the metro carrying a bunch of cash and for that i am grateful.  If you've never sent money overseas to your family then you have no place talking shit in this thread.  Stop being so negative.

2013 Budget of the United States Federal Government. [source](
* Total Tax Revenue: $2.77 trillion
* Total expenditures $3.45 trillion
* net -$680 billion deficit 
* Outstanding Debt: $17.70 Trillion (100.5% of GDP)
Note that even if we taxed 100% of everything the country produced last year, we still couldn't pay our debt.  So, assuming that by "backed", we mean there is an assumption that the piece of paper a.k.a. a USD is exchangeable for something of actual value, the USD is "backed" by next to nothing.  The ONLY thing that is "backing" the USD is the fact that it is the world reserve currency, and oil (the  commodity), is traded in dollars.  So the only way to get Oil is to get US Dollars...That's it.  Once the world bands together and decides to stop using a currency that is backed by nothing to trade oil, then we will REALLY have nothing backing it other than hopes, dreams, and promises.

I may be wrong on this so someone can correct me, but I read once in Japan if you are in death row you are jailed in a cell with tatami mat floors with a square panel in the middle.  This panel in the middle can be dropped out and used in the process of hanging you, and your death punishment can be levied at any time.  So you can be hung in 2 weeks or 20 years, you never know which day is your last, and every time you here a sound of that door opening it could possibly be the end of the road for you. 
This method of death penalty has to be the worst torture on the planet.  I know the anticipation would drive me to insanity or suicide in no time flat.

How about not directly promoting bitcoin as so many people seem to not be liking.  How about promoting the community? 
E.g. Have his trunks say with the reddit alien holding the bitcoin symbol?  That way it's clear that a community is sponsoring the fighter, and not a "currency".  That way people viewing will go straight to this sub where they can learn all they want about the currency if they want.  
I dunno if this violates reddit's TOS but...i'm sure if enough people were willing to pick up the phone something could be arranged.

Yeah, I really wish we’d stop poking the bear because in its current state bitcoin would be trivially easy for the u.s. government to kill adoption.  They can’t “kill” bitcoin, but they can make it so useless that it might as well be dead 
For example, how many exchanges exist that accept USD / BTC in both directions.  5? 10? 
We can raid all of those at the same time on the same day.  Easy.  Brian Armstrong? You’re going to jail.  Jessie Powell, enjoy federal prison. 
Introducing the American Freedom First Act that makes all crypto currencies illegal.  Not only that but anyone caught using it will be branded a terrorist 
“But we have Bisq and ~~local bitcoins~~!” 
Now imagine reading on reddit every month “I made a transfer on Bisq and the other end was a fucking fed.  Do not use!” 
So now any business operating in the u.s. won’t accept bitcoin and if you try to exchange for fiat face to face you run the risk of getting ganked by an undercover agent. 
How many people would use bitcoin then? The government has done this exact thing with online gambling before so it’s not some fantasy 
We need to cool it with this anti government anarchist shit and just keep building up adoption in the background.  Nothing to see here government

That’s not true.  People can gamble in online casinos in countries that have made it illegal (United States).  And can buy illegal drugs online thanks to crypto.  
Also, arguably you can move money across borders more easily with crypto, though everyone I’ve talked to that does that kind of thing still uses $100 bills.
These are much smaller use cases than everyone wants to hear in the crypto world but they are real use cases for people with real problems 
It blows my mind how many people have forgotten the entire purpose of crypto which is censorship resistance (hint: it’s in the name...crypto).  So the only people that need to use it are the ones getting censored by their government or mega corps.  No one else needs this shit. (Looking at you ethereum fans).

Yeah for sure, at least currently.  I think there might be a use case for micro transactions online as well via bitcoins lightning network.  Like right now the merchants just eat the credit card processing fee of $2.7 + 25 cents.  So if you had a small digital product you wanted to sell for less than $5-$10 it’s probably not worth it 
I’m not exactly sure if there are any products that fit in that category or if the masses would be willing to give up their awesome buyer protection where they can charge back for any reason and are almost completely protected from fraud.
I do however, think that adding micro transactions to digital platforms may be the best way to combat bots and brigading 
Like if it cost you some fraction of a penny to upvote or comment and it got less expensive the better your reputation was and more expensive the newer your account was and the amount of times you got flagged for trolling or being a racist asshole.  Then it would become much more expensive to socially engineer panic, hysteria, and violence.
Obviously there are a ton of problems with this idea and it’s not a cure all 
But if we continue to rely on advertising as a revenue generator the only logical conclusion is clickbait and polarizing brigading

Since you have experience with database architecture I’m curious how you feel about Ethereum 
To me it seems obvious that Dapps and smart contract coins offer no efficiency over just using a regular database and AWS and this they will always be more expensive and more slow than any of the apps we know and love today 
Yet to your point earlier about the importance of dev involvement, there are hordes and hordes of developers flocking to Ethereum presumably in order to get rich 
As someone old enough to remember this feels a lot like the dot com bubble, and even though we are in a downswing now I worry that there is a much worse crash that’s possible 
Do you think there are good developers working on Ethereum based projects and are they on a fools errand?

If we are operating under the assumption that the “plan” of bitcoin is to be a decentralized store of value then I think the most important “backup plan” is monero not Ethereum 
Not that I believe that monero will be successful per se, but I think that the fact that monero is a different elliptical curve than bitcoin and also has completely different philosophies than bitcoin as far as hard forking every 6 months and also taking a different stance on privacy/fungibility 
Just the fact that it’s so different than the things that are foundational to bitcoin but the overall goal is the same make t a good hedge for bitcoin 
Ethereum on the other hand is its own beast.  It could be a lottery ticket, web 2.0, or it could be fucking Chernobyl.  Who knows.  I don’t wish ill anyone and hope that someone builds something that actually works and achieves scale in the near future just to alleviate my fears that everything built on that platform is built specifically to extract wealth from the general population without giving up any shares

Yeah, the problem is liquidity with both gold and crypto.  Like I can’t pay for a meal for my family with bitcoin (in 99.9% of local businesses) and I can’t pay in gold coin either

At the risk of sounding like a BCash shill (I’m a maximalists y’all please don’t pitchfork me), bitcoin is too expensive in its current state (maybe for the foreseeable future?) for “super poor” people to use.
I’m assuming you mean super poor on the world scale where people are making the equivalent of single digit dollars per week 
For people struggling to survive there is zero use case for taking the $1 they made today and getting hit with a 20 cent or more fee to buy some bitcoin, and then they can’t even spend it anywhere that matters 
Of course our retort every time a bcasher starts huffing and puffing is “well lightning network will solve this problem!” 
Except some poor fucker in India can’t afford to have any amount of money locked up for any reason.  Good luck explaining inbound/outbound capacity to him. 
To your point you say “long term value” which hopefully implies a point way later in the future.  But I think it’s important to point out we have a tremendous amount of work to do before bitcoin is useful to the super poor.
Right now it’s only useful to rich people by world standards, and by rich I mean basically everyone living in a western nation as well as upper middle class and above in developing nations

Exactly, and they can throw people in jail for doing local bitcoins and for running exchanges that serve u.s. customers 
And as bitfinex can attest, even if you have your dollars secured outside of the u.s. jurisdiction they can find a way to take it.  
So imagine if there was no local bitcoins, and all the underground exchange sites kept getting seized and then invaded with undercover law enforcement like what happens with the dark markets.  And 1/3 underground exchanges exit scam all their users 
And imagine if there was no coinbase, kraken, square, etc 
How many people would really use bitcoin?  Then imagine if the United States went crazy like we did for 9/11 and started imposing sanctions on every country that used bitcoin 
How many people would use it then? 
I can’t stress enough how dangerous it is for the figureheads in this space to keep constantly taunting the government as if the honey badger can’t be stopped and the $USD is doomed for failure (even if it’s true) .

Yes. He could just sign any transaction from one of the original wallets.  Easy peasy. Doesn’t even have to be the big wallet we associate with satoshi , could even be a really old wallet.  But he can’t do that either

Yeah, you have the right idea.  The collection of routes having the capacity being all you need isn’t a thing yet but they are working on that feature

Something for the noobs and even the old timers in the space: 
If you held through the winter and have some nice gains, consider locking in some of your wins by buying something nice 
Consider one of the major criticisms of bitcoin from economists is that a deflationary currency encourages people to hold and not spend, but you need spending to prop up an economy . 
One of the things I like to do is to treat myself to something more on the expensive side that I’ve been eyeing for awhile but didn’t want to pull the trigger on. Like a nice video card, or computer, or whatever.  That way when the market dips the losses won’t feel as bad and you’ll have something nice

I agree with your statement in theory, however The problem with the red pill statement is that so far it hasn’t happened anywhere, whereas the scenario I laid out has happened time and time again 
That’s why I’ve been tracking Venezuela so closely.  If everything we believe about bitcoin is true, then we should see the population there overthrow their government and adopt bitcoin en masse 
Though we see promising signs with the local bitcoins volume going sky high there, every Venezuelan I’ve ever talked to or heard in interviews still says like 90%+ of the population doesn’t use bitcoin 
Venezuelans are the perfect use case for bitcoin.  Rapidly inflating currency, suffering population, cheap electricity 
If we can’t get widespread adoption of bitcoin in Venezuela then I give the developed world a near 0% chance of achieving mass adoption 
Maybe some Venezuelans reading this can chime in and let us know if more people are using bitcoin down there

That seems shortsighted though, all the government has to do is lower the subsidies or add a VAT to consumers of the electric company which presumably has close ties to the government like in every other country 
It’s going to be too hard to tax the bitcoin themselves or prevent people from using it.  Just tax them upstream at the source.  Easy Peasy
More likely what happened is these miners didn’t pay off the local police their extortion money so they got raided and the police are going to mine it themselves

Also Bitcoin has a huge portion of the market cap of all crypto.  I don't want to pull a number out of my ass but I would guess it's a multiple of the percentage that the USD has of the world currency market cap. 
If the USD went to zero, everything else would collapse (as evidenced by 2008), so Bitcoin going to zero or even crashing by a lot would probably have the same ripple effect.  Or is it a tsunami effect at that scale?

Yes it’s possible.  Reasons to invest are entirely up to the individual 
For me I was pretty pissed about the 2008 bank bailouts and would like to see a world where the monetary supply isn’t controlled by 12 white guys in a closed room. 
I also want to see the experiment of a deflationary currency play out .  Consider the art work of dead artists.  They’ll never make another one and every once in awhile they get lost or destroyed.  Price goes up.  
What happens when money has this property?  
Though most bitcoiners would tell you this future is an inevitability, if we were really honest with ourselves bitcoin provably has a single digit percentage chance of replacing the USD as the world reserve currency.  Probably more like a fraction of a percent .
But it’s the best chance we have to disrupt the central banking system and that’s worth giving it a shot in my opinion

I don’t think bigger blocks are a solution, I don’t have the technical knowledge to make that call, nor do I think we should per se.  I’ve heard very good arguments from smart people that I do trust that bigger blocks present a security risk.  Plus bcash and bsv are running that experiment so we will see how that plays out 
I don’t think bitcoin should much change at all.  But a side effect of that is that super poor people will probably be priced out of the game.  
Again, not saying either way is good or bad but that’s just the way it is.  I’m sure there can be some centralized service that eats the cost of the on chain transaction in order to provide liquidity and small balances to lightning network users in india and Africa etc, but we are so far away from that world who knows if it will ever get done 
I know for sure if someone wants to be a sovereign individual and live the pure bitcoin life running your own node and using the existing apps.  You have to be lower-middle class in first world countries or rich in developing worlds 
Not saying that won’t change in the future, but that’s where we are now.  And I think it’s hypocritical for us to bash ethereum die hards for constantly parroting “proof of stake will solve all of these criticisms in the future” 
As bitcoiners we are like “those guys are dumb, they’re never gonna get there, the tech doesn’t work, there’s no proof in that economic model, it promotes centralization, etc”
And then we turn around and go “lightning is going to solve all of these criticisms in the future”

It’s honestly not that bad.  People are going full on tribal mode in this thread and need to take a breath. 
From a purely objective (as best as I can) point of view, the reason tacking on a utility token to anything is sub optimal is because the user has to experienced both FX risk and double transaction fees.  
FX Risk is foreign exchange risk, which means if a user has to buy BAT they have to consider the fluctuating price of USD to BAT or USD to ETH to BAT. 
The transaction fees occur if you’re buying through an exchange.  As in you’ll have to buy ETH which has a transaction fee and then exchange ETH to BAT. I’m not actually sure if you can buy BAT directly
This is actually the primary argument at the core (pun intended) of bitcoin maximalism.  The idea is that it’s better for everyone if we all use the same base currency.  If everything is priced in bitcoin then there would be no FX risk and there would be less legal risk as the crypto to fiat on-ramp is where a lot of hacks occur (BTCE , Quadriga, Mt Gox Bitfinex, etc) as well as all of the law enforcement action as they can pin money laundering on you if you are exchanging anything with USD without a license 
I’m of the opinion if people want to use BAT they can use BAT.  If they want to use lightning they’ll use lightning.  We got into crypto literally because we wanted a libertarian paradise where people can scam and hack each other without recourse and you have complete control of your money. 
Let’s just calm the fuck down and let the markets decide.

While I agree the comparisons are not that useful, I have to push back on the statement that “gold is THE number one money”
If we go by the definition of money is a medium of exchange , then Gold has been a terrible form of money ever since the US government eliminated the gold standard (you used to be able to exchange a paper note for the equivalent in gold) 
Additionally , gold is very hard to break down and/or transport.  E.g. if I have a gold coin and want to buy something worth .10 gold coins I can’t really shave off pieces of the coin to buy the product
Worse still there aren’t many merchants that accept gold so I can’t exchange gold for goods and services 
The best money is generally whatever is the world reserve currency which makes the best money currently unquestionably the u.s. dollar .  You can exchange it for oil, pretty much everything is priced in dollars, and you can even use it in countries that aren’t the United States as they have adopted the dollar as their national currency because their money went to shit. 
Gold aficionados would say “gold isn’t the best money, it’s the best store of value”.  But the price of gold compared to other stores of value don’t reflect that.  
Mathematically the best store of value (as far as gains) for the last few decades has been a low fee S&amp;P 500 index fund like Vanguards admiral shares.  And the least risky store of value is a total bond market index fund. 
Bitcoin theoretically could become the best currency (due to lightning network) AND the best store of value (due to scarcity) but it’s a moonshot at best.  And this is coming from someone who is balls deep in this space and really hopes for bitcoins success 
Every other blockchain project makes zero sense (except for maybe the privacy coins) because none of them are solving a problem that isn’t already solved with existing technology, or they are trying to compete directly with bitcoin in a way that’s less secure

One thing I’m confused about is who is on the buy side of these transactions? 
Like who is actively buying up Bolivares when they’re rapidly depreciating? I wonder if the buyers have a government contact or some way they are exchanging them for dollars?
@_date: 2019-04-28 17:34:01
At the rate of inflation they are experiencing during the time you receive your fiat to the time you spend it or put it in your bank account it has lost an appreciable amount of purchasing power 
So people have to rush to spend it.  Since it’s illegal for them to exchange it for USD which is far more stable, their best options are to: Instantly spend it on a good or service, or exchange it for bitcoin which despite its volatility is still more stable than the bolivar 
The problem is I don’t think very many merchants accept crypto in Venezuela, and I don’t think many employers pay in crypto.  Those two things need to happen for them to de couple themselves from the bolivar
@_date: 2019-04-08 16:25:46
One thing I have yet to implement but am intrigued by is the idea that you can create a multisig vault using different hardware wallets through Electrum.   
We have seen at various times both Trezor and Ledger being potentially vulnerable to attacks if someone has physical access to the device.  We've also seen weird software bugs that have caused people to lose their funds.   
With an Electrum multisig vault multiple device platforms would have to be compromised at the same time which is super unlikely.

Notice how no one cares about bitcoin diamond, bitcoin gold, bitcoin unlimited etc

I wish we would get over hard labeling things and then refusing to see the benefits of the other position.  The world is much more nuanced in 2019.  There’s no such thing as a pure capitalist system (source: bank bailouts, crony capitalism, Verizon lawyer is FCC chair, etc) 
And there is no such thing as pure socialism.  But there are arguments for both sides 
For example, I think I can make a very convincing argument for socialist healthcare that would convince even hardcore libertarians, but I can’t ever get past “socialism sounds like communism and communism is evil and doesn’t work because of Russia and Venezuela and so the entire premise is invalid”

First of all since you’re new to the space, Bitpay have been one of the worst actors in the space.  Read up about the New York Agreement and Segwit2X.  Bitcoin literally would have stopped working if the people involved in that closed door meeting had their way.  
And none of them have admitted how wrong they were which has been really frustrating.  
Not to mention they do things to actively hurt bitcoin and make the user experience annoying like not supporting bech32 addresses and using their proprietary shitty address that no one supports
For example you can’t (at least the last time I tried) buy a ledger nano from ledgers own website using your ledger device because of the address incompatibility 
Unfortunately so many people in the space use them because they’ve been here for so long.  It’s so bad that old timers in the space made competitors specifically to get people to stop using Bitpay.  Examples are BTCPay server , Globee, and OpenNode 
IMHO, when evaluating anything in the crypto space, I use the heuristic: “does this product offer something that hasn’t existed or can’t exist in the normal world (Silk Road), or if there is a competing product that already exists, does the new product offer a 10x better experience for the user?” 
When you look at crypto through that lens you start to see how useless almost everything is in the space (looking at you Ethereum tokens!).  
As far as interesting companies that fit my heuristic check out:
- Purse.io : you can exchange bitcoin for things listed on amazon and get a huge discount on it 15-18%.  Basically in third world countries there are people that use Amazon’s mechanical Turk to earn money, but the problem is they get paid out in Amazon credit which is useless for someone in India or wherever.  So their equivalent of predatory payday lenders are people that will exchange local currency for amazon dollars at a huge 20% markup.  
Purse.io sits in the middle by offering a way for people with Amazon credits to exchange for bitcoin at a better rate.  Basically you will put an item you want in a public wishlist.  Then someone out in the world will buy it for you using their amazon bucks.  Then when the package is delivered you say you got it and purse releases your bitcoin to them.  
- NitrogenSports / Bodog / BetOnline / AmericasCardroom.  Gambling sites that accept bitcoin.  One of the few ways you can actually earn bitcoin 
- Satoshis Treasure.  Worldwide treasure hunt.  Like Ready Player One.  Teams solve puzzles for a $1 million + bitcoin prize 
- Finalmessage.io a deadman’s switch.  You create a message and recipients and as long as you pay the bitcoin invoice the message stays undelivered.  If a set time passes and you don’t renew the message gets sent.  The use case for this is if you’re bitcoin rich you can our all of your money in a multisig address and give your family members two keys.  The third key (yours) can be saved in the final message so that if you die the key will be sent to your family members so they can have access to the key and your funds.  Trust me.  There are MILLIONS of bitcoin lost because people have lost the keys or died without teaching their family how to access it.  
- Casa / Nodl.  Companiesoffering plug and play devices making it super easy to run your own node
- Wasabi / Samourai Wallets.  One of the major issues with bitcoin is how easily traceable the transactions are.  Just imagine, if/when governments realize how big a threat bitcoin is to their power, they will make it illegal.  And if you haven’t been coinjoining and you made a transaction that can be tied to your personal identity.  Bing bang boom, they have your address and know how much bitcoin you’re stashing.  Governments have done this in the past with things like Gold and Firearms.  First they make you register your assets in the database, then they go door to door seizing everything.  Wasabi and Samourai do something called coinjoining where everyone’s coins get mixed in a pool and then it because difficult if not impossible to trace the source of a transaction 
Those are my favorites.  There are some really cool companies involved in the lightning network but it’s not quite ready for prime time.  But if you want to go down that rabbit hole check out:
Zap wallet, Joule, Breeze wallet, Satoshis Place, Lightning Paywall, and some others that escape my mind.  
Hope that helps!  Remember to keep your coins off exchanges and that everyone is trying to steal your bitcoin.  Good luck out there!

Right, that’s kind of my point.  We haven’t really established why we need bitcoin to replace PayPal or Visa for everyday transactions .
As far as I can tell what we need so far is for bitcoins price to keep going up because it not only makes us wealthier, but it encourages new people to put their money in and keep the system going
As you mentioned litecoin is bitcoin but with the lower fees and faster transaction times .  So why do we need bitcoin to be used for every day payments?

I'm a big fan of [Azte.co]( and hope they can start rolling out at liquor stores, barber shops, gas stations, etc.  Particularly in poor neighborhoods.  Think there is market demand for people that want to secure a % of the cash they have instead of holding it all on their person.

Unfortunately this is categorically untrue.  There are  way more examples of businesses that accept crypto and removed it due to lack of volume (Steam, Dell) Twitch probably, though they didn’t say it was from volume specifically 
Also anytime someone in the sub says they own a store that accepts crypto and you ask them how many people buy using crypto they always say almost never 
The only two businesses where I believe it’s true they would lose “a ton” of business by not accepting crypto are: VPNs, online casinos in America, and private torrent / Usenet trackers

Also you can’t really buy anything with gold, like I can’t shave off gold pieces to pay people. 
So what makes something a “store of value?” 
The answer to that is mostly faith.  In that way both gold and bitcoin are stores of value.  The only difference is that gold takes up physical space and bitcoin has a shorter history a

The weird thing is that if they wanted a peer-to-peer payment system, Venmo is fucking awesome, and is already crushing the transaction volume of all the cryptocurrencies combined.
And if he wanted a peer-to-peer non-reversible cash, Monero is a much better choice than anything on the bitcoin platform due to the traceability of the bitcoin blockchain.
I will give credit where credit is due though, Bcash is much easier to pay for things on the internet because of the standardized wallets.  Bitcoin needs to get segwit/bech32 address adoption to 100% and also to burn bitpay to the fucking ground because the user experience for spending bitcoin is horribad.

Wow holy shit, “easily argue” that “simple possession of CP poses no risk to others”.  
I agree with you that this gets added to my long list of why I think Vitalik is a bad jockey to pin your crypto religion on.
That statement is nonsense simple possession of CP poses risk to the individual possessor since CP is illegal everywhere .  Simple possession poses risk to the child who is the victim of the video because it demonstrates market demand which can increase the risk of the video producer abusing more children in the future, and simple possession poses risk to future children because of the afore mentioned demonstration of market demand by acquiring and holding 
I can’t imagine an argument where simple possession doesn’t pose any risk to others.  Though I suppose without seeing the prior messages that Preceded Vitaliks dumb statement it’s possible that we are unfairly judging the statement out of context

Regarding horror stories:
There was one big one in Germany where the guys house got raided by the police because the purchaser was part of some kind of large scale credit card fraud enterprise and the Purse.io user's transaction got flagged as part of the conspiracy. 
More common are issues where there is something wrong with the item , either the item is the wrong product, or the product is damaged, or the product doesn't get delivered and it's challenging to fix the problem since Amazon customer service wants to deal with the person who purchased the product and not the recipient 
Others have reported issues of purchasers using fraudulent credit cards / gift cards and getting flagged by Amazon,  or attempting to do charge back fraud to get the item shipment cancelled, after the bitcoin have been sent. 
I have no idea how common these stories are or even if they're just FUD.  So I'm glad to hear good stories from regular people like you

100% agree.  People think I'm crazy but I think that there's a chance that the local bitcoiners in the US that are exchanging huge volumes of cash are just honeypots for the three letter agencies so that they can get an idea of how much cash is getting laundered through bitcoin. 
Why else would a u.s. citizen regularly pay a premium to buy bitcoin when they can just use a credit card or checking account unless they were laundering dirty money into bitcoin, or they were a government funded person.  
Doesn't make any sense to me but I hope I'm wrong

Dude you guys gotta read up on SEC law.  If you sell to u.s. citizens you are subject to u.s. securities law, and so unless your company is based in a country that doesn’t have an extradition treaty with the u.s. you are at risk to get ripped out of your bed and flown back to stand trial in the u.s.
There are so many examples of this I can’t even count but even in the crypto space look at BTC-e and the Silk Road 
The FBI raided the data center of BTCE and also seized Silk Road servers in Iceland...let that sink in for a minute.  How did that even happen? How was that legal?

Good question.  HW wallets are the result of the underlying risk of two intersecting fundamentals of bitcoin.  Immutability and Anonymity.  
Immutability meaning once a transaction is made, it can't be reversed without a hard fork.  And Anonymity meaning there can be an infinite number of wallets and no identity tied to any of them 
The beauty of these things is that bitcoin is perfect for people that want to circumvent the traditional banking and credit card system 
The downside is that if you get your shit stolen, or are a victim of fraud.  There is zero recourse.  No charge backs. No police. No fraud detection.
That means that people that own cryptocurrency, especially noobs in the space, are like big fat juicy targets for hackers.  
All you need is the private keys to a wallet and the funds are yours for the taking.  Nothing will ever get traced back to you...Except for the guy that hacked mt gox.  But that was a billion dollar heist. 
So where do you hide the private keys do your digital safe?  If you store it on any device connected to the internet: phone, PC , etc.  You run the risk of having malware or keyloggers on your computer that you don't know about that are just waiting for something that looks like a private key, and then you wake up and poof.  It's all gone .  Go read the recent thread of the guy who had an Android wallet that is commonly recommended (jaxx I think) but his phone was compromised and he lost 6 figures worth of Ethereum overnight.  
You can print out paper wallets where the public key is on the front and the private key is on the back, but paper degrades over time, and if your house burns to the ground you lose all your money.  You can store the paper wallets somewhere else , like a safe deposit box.  But what is to stop the bank or the government from seizing your box and taking your shit.  Civil asset forfeiture it's a real thing and happens all the time.  All they have to do is say "drugs", "money laundering" or "terrorist" and your funds are gone.  And you STILL have to buy a brand new printer, make sure it's not connected to the internet, and then destroy it after the print job because the print file is stored locally.  That's a lot of work .
Another option is building a dedicated pc or raspberry pi that's never connected to the internet EVER to use as a wallet. But we suffer from the same house burning down to the ground scenario.
What's left?  Hardware wallets. 
The way that hardware wallets work is that your private key is stored in a secure element that never connects to the internet, but can still be used to "sign" a transaction from your wallet to another.  So even if you are using a compromised computer your funds are still safe.
The other nice thing about hardware wallets is they generate a 24 word key phrase on the device that is a backup in case you lose your device or your place burns to the ground.  And they also have cool features like fake pin codes where if someone is holding a gun to your head or a family member and is forcing you to unlock your device.  You can login to a wallet that had like...A thousand bucks or something and they will never know you are hiding more. 
Now the downside risk of hardware wallets is where do you store your 24 word backup phrase?  Same problems as private keys before. If someone accesses it they can regenerate your Wallets and steal your shit.  There are some creative ways of saving this though like giving pieces of the recovery seed to different family members so no individual can put it together. 
It's not a perfect situation but hardware wallets are definitely the safest thing to do imho .  But be careful with those. I recently read that trezor and KeePass had a major vulnerability.  As far as I know the nano S didn't suffer from the same vulnerability so that's my recommendation for a wallet.

In addition to avoiding fees, the lawyer could technically do some regulatory arbitrage with the coins. 
For example, he could just not claim the money at all on his taxes, which a smart lawyer probably wouldn't risk doing. 
Another thing he could do is to do tax loss harvesting.  Like, he could purposely cash out on a dip, and then deduct a loss on his investment which would lower his taxable income for the year.

I’m not sure how old you are, and I don’t mean that as a dig, but there was a time when every single commercial break you saw on ESPN and every channel targeted at young men had at least one online poker commercial:  party poker , full tilt, and poker stars were MASSIVE. 
We (all of us online poker players) all thought the party would never end and the easy money would keep flowing forever and then overnight the u.s. government snapped their fingers and shut down all of the payment processors that would convert your digital money into fiat 
Overnight.  It was dubbed Black Friday and was spearheaded by politicians with massive conflicts of interest that snuck the ban inside a fucking defense spending budget bill 
I keep telling the story and everyone in crypto is always like , yeah , yeah whatever...THIS TIME ITS DIFFERENT 
...it’s never different 
Look at how many places there are where you can convert crypto into u.s. dollars.  5...6 companies? Less? 
It honestly would be trivially easy for the government to shut down all the off ramps if they decided to fuck all of us.  Sure, crypto will never die, just like full tilt and poker stars are still alive.  But it would be much less popular and much less valuable if people had to jump through hoops to cash out.  
I hope I’m wrong but just be careful out there everyone reading this.

Two questions, not trying to be snarky just curious :
1 - wouldn't this be taking on the same risk as using purse.io minus the "insurance" policy that purse offers? 
2 - I've always wondered why people on local bitcoins in the u.s. would pay a premium for BTC vs just using coinbase for any reason other than they are laundering cash obtained from illegal means , using scammed credit cards or gift cards, or are a honeypot for the FBI, IRS, CIA, Secret Service, etc. to monitor how many people are exchanging BTC to Fiat and to get flagged for large movements of cash which they can use to build cases against people

Unless i'm mistaken, paying the lawyer in bitcoin could actually have benefits in specific situations.

There’s actually quite an interesting debate.  Not about Ross per se, that mofo is gonna die in prison 
The fascinating thing for me is that the idea for the  “hit” was proposed by an undercover law enforcement officer who was posing as a “fixer” / drug lord on Silk Road 
And the target was someone that the same law enforcement officer was currently in custody of, and the law enforcement officer was feeding false information through the informant 
So to summarize.  The undercover agent flips the informant , pretends to be the informant to draw Ross out of hiding, then the agent suggests under a different alias that Ross should kill the informant and that the agent will do it himself if Ross pays him.  Ross agrees and then the agent fakes the death and Ross gets charged for conspiracy to commit murder 
Oh and another fun fact. That same agent playing all sides stole 6-figures of bitcoin (now would be worth millions) from the Silk Road when he was undercover and is now currently in jail.
The interesting thing to me is that this case sets precedent that I’m not sure we want. 
This case is like if a DEA agent became your best friend.  Ride or die pal.  And then he said, hey bro, will you hold onto this kilo of cocaine for 24 hours.  I’m gonna meet up with you later. 
Then when you get on the road, the same guy hops in an unmarked police car and starts riding your ass.  Driving super aggressively.  So you tried to speed up to get away and then all these police cars pull up to you and arrest you for speeding then use probable cause to search your car and then you get arrested for cocaine possession. 
Is Ross Ulbricht a dumb shit that deserves to die in jail? Probably...who knows.  The jury thought so and the court of public opinion seems to agree so we’ll have to take it at that. 
The questions that still remain to be answered, and ones that I hope get answered in our lifetime are: 
- Why was this case not entrapment? 
- Why did the fact that the undercover agents were found to be corrupt get hidden from the jury during trial?  Would that have impacted the verdict? 
- At a technical level, how did the FBI access the Silk Road servers in Iceland?  No sysadmins / network experts believe in the FBI’s telling of the story 
- Last but not least.  Where the fuck did the 700,000 bitcoin go that was in the Silk Road wallets?  Literally no one knows.  The gov’t auctioned off 40,000 btc and there are still BILLIONS of dollars worth of bitcoin that are missing.

Ok let's see... Interesting concept but there are some fundamental problems that need to be addressed first. 
One: what medical service could you expect to receive without a physical examination?  
Without a physical examination how can you be sure people aren't fabricating lab tests in order to get certain medications?
If there is a way to arrange it so that you can get appointments through the system then what is to stop the government from raiding the doctors offices participating in these illegal exchanges (and yes they are illegal). 
The good news is that you aren't far off from an amazing idea. 
Go Google 23andme and their FDA shutdown.   
This is a situation perfect for crypto currency.  
If you build a service partnering with them where people can have their genetic data on the block chain,  only able to link to a person with a private key,  then you will be able to have all the genetic data on everyone available for research and private use. 
Then you link up the patients with vendors like doctors,  holistic practitioners,  dieticians,  etc.  who can help you parse through your genetic data without the use of prescription medications.  
Sales pitch: We are combining 23andme Theranos and the Blockchain to usher in a world where citizens are truly in control of their bodies,  and scientists have access to the most robust data set ever created 
Alternatively if u still want to go darknet,  a dark net for prescription medication is way more viable than what you were originally proposing

Right now,  for me,  as a first generation Filipino American,  sending money to family in the philippines via bitcoin is a true game changer. 
Peter Thiel says famously in his book that in a competitive market a new startup (is that redundant?)  has to be 10x better than the incumbents to really gain traction. 
Imho bitcoin isn't 10x better than credit cards for daily purchases because of reward programs, merchant adoption,  and the fact that my employer is making direct deposits in fiat so I have to convert an extra step to bitcoin which is not instant.
However sending money to family back home in bitcoin is way more than 10x better. 
The old model with Western Union would charge up to 10% in fees and my family would have to go to a western union location,  risk getting robbed or pickpocket whole they carry around a bunch of cash,  or worse. 
With the bitcoin remittance systems i can transfer bitcoin,  have it immediately converted to fiat,  and have a freaking courier motorcycle it to my mom for 1-2% in fees.   The first time I used that I knew that western union was finished.   It will be the Kodak of this decade for sure.  
While the block chain has countless industries where it can provide 10x improvement,  I struggle to find a way where bitcoin can be 10x better than credit cards for daily transactions.  
I think the only places it offers a significant advantage are like... Splitting a check at a dinner table and other group buying things,  and micro transactions. And paying for craigslist items greater than the amount of money you can take out of an ATM in one day....which brings me to my final point. 
escrow services... Something seriously needs to be done about PayPal charge backs,  they are the devil incarnated and if someone can use bitcoin to make a 10x improvement on that they will be my hero.

The problem with little circulation and the amount of people not running full nodes and relying on third party exchanges is...are there actually “more” bitcoin in “circulation” than is actually true ?
As in, are the exchanges all 100% in reserves or are they just serving people a number in a data table 
If they aren’t 100% reserved as they should be, then there’s really no point to the fully validated blockchain, and also BTC won’t really be a deflationary asset.

Ok let’s play this out because it’s a fun thought experiment 
Let’s assume that the website owner isn’t incorporated in Malta or some jurisdiction that you can’t get to 
You probably signed a terms of service that says any lawsuit had to go to arbitration instead of a jury trial
You say “mr arbiter the owner tricked me into buying the wrong thing and I demand restitution!”
“What were you trying to buy?”
“It says right here bitcoin bch . I don’t understand the mixup”
Then you go into an hour long rant about bitcoin core, hard forks, soft forks , roger ver, jihan wu, mining etc
Arbiter: “ok so you say these bitcoin core people are the OG motha fuckas and they know what’s up.  Do they have a trademark for “Bitcoin (BTC)”
“Well no sir...they didn’t invent bitcoin that was Satoshi Nakamoto”
“Oh ok now we are getting somewhere.  Does this...mr nakamoto own the trademark for Bitcoin BTC”
“Well no...”
“Does he own the patent for Bitcoin BTC”
“Well no...”
“Can we bring him in to get an official statement from him?”
“Well no sir...no one actually knows who he is and he kind of...well he kind of disappeared”
“Ok so we established that there is no identity for anyone to steal, the website may be lying be we have no proof that it’s true, and last but not least you claim there was a financial loss.  So did the price of BCH go down while BTC went up”
“Well no...pretty much all cryptocurrencies follow the price of bitcoin so...”
Are you guys starting to see how this proposed lawsuit isn’t as easy as you are claiming?  The scammers out there aren’t stupid.  They know they can prey on noobs and there are no consequences.  The only people that are actually close to going to jail are the scam ICOers because there is at least legal precedent for selling unregistered securities to American citizens 
And even then no one has gone to jail yet that I know of.  So this website fuckery that OP posted above is going to go on unchecked

Interestingly there is legal precedent to make tipping illegal in the u.s as there are studies that show blacks get tipped less than whites across all industries so you could argue that it is discriminatory and thus illegal. (I'm not a lawyer I just heard this I a freakonomics podcast)
There just has to be a lawyer who is passionate enough to draw up a massive class action lawsuit to get the ball rolling

Serious question, what could dispensaries do?  If they took fiat and Bitcoin they would still have a problem as most people would only pay in cash
If they just took Bitcoin they might lose a lot of business 
Also, if they got busted exchanging their cash deposits for Bitcoin could they get nailed for money laundering ?

I like it!
You hit the nail on the head in the bold text.  What I am most excited about the day when non-profit organizations take all of their donations into bitcoin and you can see where every dime is spent. 
Hopefully a big non-profit with a ton of political clout will show how useful that system will be and a small-progressive town in america decides, what the hell, lets use this to audit our treasury.  
Though mostly I hope to the gods that someone is working on healthcare data on the blockchain.  Maybe one of you experts could shed some light if my ideal situation is possible or not with bitcoin technology?
I envision every patient getting a "wallet" with all of their health data on it.  You can start with just the history and physical and medications to start, but eventually you could expand to inputs like "Medication A taken at X time" "BP was 120/80 at this time" "HR was 60 at this time" and the wallet can only be read if both the patient and a health provider use their private keys.  
Hospitals / Clinics / Nurses can only ever connect the data to the patient when the patient is there to verify their private key, and private keys are only administered to "full nodes" which incentivises healthcare organizations to run/maintain nodes securing the blockchain
Then on the backend, universities with medical research from all around the world can mine the data, also only gaining 1/2 of the private key by building/maintaining full nodes.  
Our medical universities would have access to data sets never imagined, and there is no way to ever tie the wallet to a real person.  
The medical breakthroughs that would happen from hooking up an AI machine like IBM's Watson to a data set like that would be the biggest breakthrough since antibiotics were discovered I think. 
I dunno maybe it's a little grandiose but if someone pulls it off it will change everything we know about medicine.  It will take the guesswork out of all of it.

Yeah.  The viability of the current first movers in Etherum is going to occur a year or two down the line.  I think within ten years people more than 50% of the population will be interacting with something utilizing smart contracts even if they don't realize it.
Another strong signal are the people entering the space.  Like the guy who made fucking Javascript is the one behind Brave.  And many other legends in the space. 
The thing I'm most excited about and why I'm so bullish on Ethereum is that people will be able create vast trade networks that combine individual skills and underutilized assets. 
For example, we know that insurance is an application for smart contracts.  Let's say you have a 2010 Jeep wrangler that gets in a wreck.  The frame is fucked but the engine is fine.  
We can make a series of smart contracts that activate the second the insurance adjuster declares the car is totaled.  The original driver gets paid and all of the remaining parts get listed on an open market for sale.  
On the buyer side if you own a 2010 wrangler but you need to rebuild the engine you can set aside an account with a smart contract that will activate to purchase a 2010 engine and automatically put the job to install the engine up for Bids by local mechanics, then automatically trigger a contract for a local tow company to being your Jeep to the mechanic and a delivery truck to deliver the engine from the insurance junkyard to the mechanic.  All automatically and with no middle men.  All of the proceeds go to the individuals and not a corporation.  
This is just a small application but the possibilities are endless and I'm really excited for the future of this technology who cares about the price

But it will all happen automatically.  Essentially anything that involves a multi party trade can be done on this platform without any brokers / middlemen.
Think of how many industries rely on that business model.  Home repair, home cleaning, job recruiters, temp agencies, auction houses, food and beverage markets, equipment rentals, real estate, just to name a few. 
All of these places all charge a middleman fee which drives up the price for the end user while providing no value to the transaction other than connecting the parties and providing insurance on the transaction.  
In theory they can and will all go away.

Next people wearing windbreakers start kicking down your doors, and if that doesn't work then drones start dropping bombs through your ceiling.   
I really think the entire community is grossly underestimating how big a pain in the ass the government can be if they come down hard on cryptocurrency. 
Imagine if every single crypto exchange was made illegal overnight (this has happened before with online poker payment processors becoming illegal overnight).  Next imagine that local bitcoins and bisq became massive honeypots where people started getting busted by undercover cops constantly and getting thrown in jail for money laundering.  Next imagine any merchant that accepts bitcoins will be threatened with legal action and a few would even get raided in the middle of the day for accepting bitcoin (this happened with landlords that were leasing properties to cannabis dispensaries before they became legal).  
What do you think the state of bitcoin would be in this scenario?  Ledger/Trezor won't be able to ship wallets into America without getting seized by customs at the border.  Apple and Google won't allow bitcoin apps in the app store for Americans so you'd have to Jailbreak for mobile, or run your own full node that you'd have to install yourself. 
Literally no one will go through that much trouble in the U.S. Everything I listed above has happened in one shape of form to other things the government has decided to set their targets on (drugs, online gambling, prostitution, etc) and taking down the handful of services that are crypto/fiat onramps and offramps would be TRIVIALLY easy for the government to do if they wanted to.  I can list all of the places you can exchange bitcoin for dollars on two hands.  Maybe even one hand.  Of course bitcoin will survive internationally in the more free countries, but for all of us here we'll just be blacked out.   
I think we need to seriously stop taunting regulators and constantly poking the bear when we are so vulnerable. It would be better to keep pretending like we aren't a threat, slowly get mass adoption until we are everywhere like Uber and AirBnB and we have the support of the masses to vote people out of office that try to come down too hard.

The drone strike statement are mostly if you're in a foreign country. [Though there was that time in 1985 where the police dropped a firebomb on a residential building in an effort to flush out black liberation group members and ended up killing 5 adults and 5 children in the ensuing blaze.](  
If you're in these borders you likely won't get past the kicking down your doors phase which they definitely do on "familys of 5" just because the guy bought something that the government deemed illegal or immoral.

The same way Ethereum did.  Get on a conference call with like 12 people.  Come to a "consensus" that you're going to reorg the chain.  Come up with a cool name for the operation like a "Surgical hard-fork". Re-org the chain.  Then get the community to attack anyone that suggests the roll-back was done by a central entity with one-liners like   
"THAT ROLLBACK WAS CONSENSUS DRIVEN. ETHEREUM IS DECENTRALIZED. IF IT WASN"T DECENTRALIZED THEN WHY WOULD ETHEREUM CLASSIC EXIST?!"

There’s no grounds for the distinction we make between marijuana and mushrooms vs tobacco and alcohol

It is... Sort of.   The thing is most of us that are remitting bitcoins home are sending it to people that don't know shit about tech,  so we have ReBit  convert to fiat anyway. 
The people this affects are people that are working as virtual assistants etc who are now earning their income in bitcoin which allows them to spend their money more easily. 
Keep in mind the philippines doesn't really have credit cards and contracts due to people skipping out on their bills so stuff like this makes everything a little more accessible. 
Now ReBit  the service itself is HUGE.  It is so much cheaper to send money to the philippines now vs when we had to use western union

Depends on who you ask.  If you ask the thousands of DEA / FBI / Local Police agents making a living off of the war on drugs they’d say its working great!

It will for sure be in some token.  Exchanges are not solvent enough to cover these kinds of losses.  Really surprising why more people don't demand things like Kraken's proof of reserve system from every exchange.

Seems like a reasonable user experience and not confusing for new people at all.  Hope they don’t send BTC to a bitcoin cash address and vice versa!
