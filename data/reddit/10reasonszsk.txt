It's difficult to look so far ahead in the future. The landscape changes dramatically every year it's already difficult enough to plan for that. The crux of the argument is will there be users to pay for the inevitably high fee prices to make up for a lack of block reward. This paper presents various solutions involving some form of inflation to pay the miners. Personally, I don't think it's a good idea. The only changes to the protocol im in favor of is reducing the block size in the KB range.

it's funny because in reality the opposite is true. Most environmental waste comes from agriculture to feed humans. The meat consumption industry is actually quite efficient compared to the waste created from "green" products. But of course they wont tell you that because the upmarked plastic packaged "Organic Vegan heavily processed" food sells for much higher keeping the consumer economy chugging along.

Dog, retailers pay shit tons for worse POS hardware. They download the entire chain for you and stress test it. If you want you can do it yourself of course just make it yourself they are not trying to hide anything in the specs.

if youre looking for a way to gift bitcoins to a family member this holiday season you should check out [ it's a custodial service specifically catered towards forming good bitcoin practices. They place the bitcoin in a time-lock whilst in the meantime giving resources to the recipient to learn step by step on how to properly manage their coins. Best part is the gift has to be accepted before a charge is made. So there is a "return gift" feature.  
Also this host is so stale haha.

It's a conventional way to store wealth. Since the beginning of agriculture, humans began creating heirlooms to act as vehicles of wealth storing and transfer, as everything scaled so did the industry around it to facilitate evaluation and trade of heirlooms. Bitcoin is just a streamlined version of that. Just like a miner the artist proved their work with their energy/talent/vision spent to create it. It becomes an immutable timestamp, a snapshot of a humans life and culture can be captured in a single picture. Does the market get manipulated by whales that can shift taste/exposure at a whim? Yeah sure does, same for bitcoin. But at the end of the day theyre also subject to the swings of the market as they can be cancelled out by general opinion and other whales.
