Sorry but there are plenty of other solutions that could be implemented now that would fix this problem. Also we do not need off chain scaling(lightning) until we have reached 1b users, which wont happen for another 5-10+ years.

Gemini is the only decent exchange along with gdax
@_date: 2017-03-16 21:24:25
And what good has blockstream core done with that 76$ million? Specifically towards bitcoin
@_date: 2017-03-17 17:42:04
Yes do your job and listen to what the people want, larger block size and less fees. Bitcoin unlimited here we come.
@_date: 2017-03-07 11:13:13
hey dont call miners dumb ok? they are what makes bitcoin
@_date: 2017-03-18 04:21:50


@_date: 2017-03-16 21:18:59
Lol and how the hell is he supposed to know what was going to happen with mt.gox?
@_date: 2017-03-17 02:10:30
Looks like they are deciding as we speak. 
@_date: 2017-03-17 01:44:48
Well if you didn't notice yet, users are complaining about the blocksize and transaction fees. Miners are listening and clearly they will decide, with bitcoin unlimited of course :).
@_date: 2017-03-16 23:08:26
So why is the bitcoin network so fucking slow and transaction fees so high? And don't tell me because segwit isn't activated, as there are many other quick solutions that could have been implemented.
@_date: 2017-03-16 21:17:40
What about the 76 million blockstream was funded with? What exactly are they using it for? 
@_date: 2017-03-19 01:41:31
and that will be gavin
@_date: 2017-03-17 02:09:51
We should know shouldn't we? I mean they control bitcoin after all.
@_date: 2017-03-17 03:00:13
I guess everyone in here got goxxed.
@_date: 2017-03-17 17:46:19
More business for exchanges like gemini i guess :D
@_date: 2017-03-17 19:09:34


Why do you think that?
@_date: 2017-03-17 17:43:48
How can they call it BTU when bitcoin unlimited will become the main and majority chain? Doesn't make sense and something is wrong here.
@_date: 2017-03-17 19:35:18
dont read propaganda stories
@_date: 2017-03-17 03:23:22
what about antpool?
@_date: 2017-03-07 11:02:49
Thanks satoshi nakamoto and gavin!
@_date: 2017-03-18 04:50:22
Lol what? freedom of speech? 
@_date: 2017-03-16 23:09:32
Lol someones mad, must have got goxed.
@_date: 2017-03-17 17:41:13
How much was he paid to say this? 1 million out of that 76$ million?
@_date: 2017-03-17 01:23:54
Doesn't matter if the chain splits into two. It's part of bitcoins design read the whitepaper please. Free market will decide which one will be the main one as well as the miners. Also why not let it split so we can see what the free market wants? Core or bitcoin unlimited. As far as im concerned core is rather scared for the chain to split and is the reason why they are going for a soft fork instead of a hardfork, because they know their chain will die off and no one would use it. And for the record chinese miners and blockstream core had an agreement for a 2mb hardfork before segwit activation which by the way if you didn't know was failed by core.

@_date: 2017-03-16 21:23:02
Miners are in charge and looks like they are favoring bitcoin unlimited. I wonder why.
@_date: 2017-03-17 01:42:31

Lol? A ver supporter. Nice one.

So what if he made a video, you act as if he had a crystal ball or something.
@_date: 2017-03-17 01:43:09
LOL 
@_date: 2017-03-18 04:34:12


Lol and who is going to mine blockstream core coins again?
@_date: 2017-03-17 01:31:54
Well in that case, lets wait for the miners to decide ;). By the looks of it bitcoin unlimited will be the majority within a month or two.
@_date: 2017-03-17 01:33:15
I trust bitpay and what the ceo says.
@_date: 2017-03-18 12:39:05
@_date: 2017-03-16 23:33:48
Isn't it obvious already? 
@_date: 2017-03-07 11:12:16
Lol what the heck? 
How and what is he bribing them for? Miners have a choice to choose any pool they aren't being forced! 
@_date: 2017-03-17 17:39:13
Lol thats stupid to say
@_date: 2017-03-07 06:00:56
1. We should have increased the blocksize 2 years ago when gavin, who was handed lead of the bitcoin project by satoshi nakamoto himself mentioned it was urgent. Not sure why it has not been done yet (i guess because we need a "fee market")
2. Of course miners should be in charge of the blocksize and everything of the bitcoin system according to satoshi nakamoto himself.
3. Miners are in control and they will decide if we should hard fork or soft work segwit and even block it.
4. Of course the fees are too high!!! Why do you think people like myself are complaining about it? A couple of years ago we didn't have this issue!!
