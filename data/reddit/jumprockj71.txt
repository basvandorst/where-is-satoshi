I tried using Robinhood, $100 investment. You don’t get any private keys or wallet, something that is intangible became even more intangible. It’s good for crypto exposure but shitty you can’t send that btc to anyone. Nevertheless, I’m just leaving that $100 in there until I desperately need it.

Im surprised this has gotten overlooked on this subreddit, over silly moon memes and $10K achievements. News like this is what is going to drive Bitcoin and other cryptos to the moon.  Its only going to be a matter of time when hyperinflation hits the US and the prime rates hit 10% or higher. Its good news for crypto hodlers and terrible news for the fiat dependents.
