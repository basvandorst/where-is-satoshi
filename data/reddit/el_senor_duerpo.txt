Transactions per day is, indeed, a "rough" measure of real GDP in the bitcoin economy on any given day. Think of it this way: there is some distribution of the value of any given transaction. Some transactions may be highly valuable, like cars or homes, while some may have no intrinsic value, like transferring money from one wallet to another owned by the same person. From this, we can calculate the average value per transaction and, multiplying by the total number of transactions, find the real gdp for that day.
Now, if we suppose that the distribution of value over transactions is constant over time, then the average value per transaction will be constant, and real gdp over time will simply be a scalar multiple of transactions per day. Thus, while the units on the vertical axis might change, the basic relationship of the graph will remain unchanged. 
I think this perspective helps to think about the more difficult problem. If the distribution of value over transactions changes day-to-day, then we would need to re-calculate the average value per transaction, and this might substantially change my measure. However, in order to explain the 50% collapse in transactions per user per day since late March, we would require massive changes in the distribution of the value of transactions. For example, if half of all of the transactions taking place a few weeks ago were useless moves between wallets that have all died down, then yes the economy is fine. That seems like a strong, unrealistic assumption. It's more likely that a good portion of the downturn is genuine hoarding of bitcoins.

Two things:
First, my measure is definitely off, because I cannot account for the value of transactions. However, if the distribution of value of transactions per person does not change substantially over time, then my measure is accurate up to some scalar multiple. So the graph would look the same, but all the numbers on the y-axis would be multiplied by some constant. All relative comparisons (i.e. 50% drop) would remain the same. 
If, however, the value of transactions is changing, then my measure is off in a more profound way. However, in order for fewer transactions between wallets owned by the same person are fully responsible for what appears to be an increase in hoarding, we would have to believe that half of all transactions 2-3 weeks ago were of this nature. While I'm sure the distribution of value over transactions changes over time, I imagine its much more on the scale of daily noise than seismic shifts.
Second, it's important to recognize that the bitcoin economy is almost entirely pure-exchange. What I mean by that is that there's very little production. Yes, you may be able to buy a video game on Amazon using bitcoins, but Amazon as a firm did not pay for its capital (warehouses, servers, employees' salaries, etc.) using bitcoins. Thus, the only value-added by the bitcoin economy was the gap between the retailers and the consumers. Therefore, the bitcoin receives most of its value from its use as a medium of exchange, not its ability to create or store wealth. If the point of the currency is to provided a more convenient form of liquidity, then it's not at all clear that moving bitcoins from one wallet to another (owned by the same person) does not have value. After all, that person is merely using a currency re-distribute her liquidity across multiple mediums, which is exactly the function from which the currency derives its value.

I agree. If people play less Satoshi Dice, then they are gambling less in the economy. That gambling certainly counts towards bitcoin gdp since people enjoy it, but gambling bitcoins is too risky when simply holding them earns such a high return. Instead, everyone is stocking up on bitcoins, which is a deflationary bubble. Thus the Satoshi Dice website is doing far less business during the bitcoin recession.

You could do that. Or you could simply move the nominal exchange rate up with the US price index. This would create a zero-inflation bitcoin economy. Unfortunately, the exchanges would have to credibly commit to continually raising nominal rates, which would be mildly deflationary and would required exchanges to step into the void whenever demand dries up quickly. This would be an interesting experiment. It will work so long as small deflation and anchored expectations work, but I doubt it over the long haul. At any moment, the exchanges may have to liquidate their own net worth in order to prop up the currency.

Awesome. May I suggest financing your business and paying your workers in bitcoins? That would really signal that you are serious about the bitcoin economy, and that this isn't just a cheesy sales pitch.
@_date: 2013-04-14 07:04:57
I guess my sarcasm was too thick. Your point was my point. We're in violent agreement.

You understand that I don't literally need a variable that represents the total number of users, just something that moves in relative proportion to the number of users, plus or minus some error with reasonably small variance. I think this graph ( demonstrates that the daily noise is smaller than the overall trends. In addition, filtering by moving averages yields the underlying movement ( Unless you can tell a credible story about how the sudden doubling of unique IPs in the past three weeks has absolutely nothing to do with changes in the number of people who want to hold bitcoins, this is a small matter. And approximations are all that's available.

Sure, dude. Sure. Ad hominem much?

Upon second thought, without production in the bitcoin economy, this just has to be a ponzi scheme. And I think that's important. Any attempt to artificially create an inflation-protected currency without any production behind it is, necessarily, a ponzi scheme.

Two words: log scale.
@_date: 2013-04-11 19:02:00
It's down 50% in a day and a half. Interpret that however you like.
Log scales do not represent percentage changes, the derivative of a log scale does that. 
However, daily percentage changes can also be deceptive. For example, suppose the value of bitcoins goes up by a factor of 10. That's 900% up. Then it collapses back to its original value. That's 90% down. Log scales may skew the percentage changes are under-stating the collapse.
Lastly, log scales only approximate percentage changes for "small" changes. When the price doubles or drops by half, the approximation is no good.

Good observation. In fact, looking between May-June 2012, there more gradual increase in the number of users. This was not sudden nor large enough to set of a deflationary bubble. Looking at transactions per person per day, we can see a corresponding increase in May-June 2012, despite the fact that the denominator increased. Why? The numerator increased as the market made room for these extra users. However, the latest leap in users was strong enough to set of a deflationary spiral. Rather than the market making room for these extra users, it's going in the opposite direction as people hoard bitcoins. So the increase in users at the end is not a problem, it's part of the point!

Wallets open faster than the queues for bitcoins move on the spot market. Good point, that I didn't fully consider.  However, this could have two causes. One is that bitcoins are so popular that the exchange servers can't keep up. If this is true, then as people move through the queue and buy their bitcoins, all will be well. The other possibility, which I am arguing, is that queues are backed up due to a lack of liquidity, driven by the desire to hoard the currency. If this is the case, then queues will loosen up and clear just as we begin to witness a mass liquidation. Time will tell.

It's true, it's not your fault. But no production will commence in the bitcoin economy so long as there is deflation. Deflation increases the cost to borrowers who make investments. 
As for your last concern, it sounds to me like you're having liquidity problems. But that's exactly the problem with deflation and hoarding. I have an idea: print more bitcoins. But that can't be done. That's the point of bitcoins, and that's why it will never work.
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:52:07
Yes, but why are you focused on the nominal exchange rate rather than the real exchange rate between goods and services? If you're thinking in dollars, then you're not really in the bitcoin economy.

Yep. Hoarding.

Um, no.
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:48:03
Thanks, I thought it was funny too. 
Not so sure it's ridiculous tho... I think the point is that people are not thinking in terms of goods and services (real economic output). Instead, they're still measuring their gains in dollars, which calls into question the notion of a "bitcoin economy".

Fair enough, I should have mentioned this earlier. I'm using the number of unique IP addresses ( used per day as a proxy for the number of users per day. Obviously, this is not a perfect measure, but no measure is perfect with a crypto currency designed for anonymity. However, it seems reasonable that the large swings in unique IPs (10k or more) represent real changes to the user base, not noise.
@_date: 2013-04-11 21:45:10
That does look nicer, but I think the thing you circled in July 2011 was the first bubble. I was highlighting a genuine correction (arguably) that took place in May 2012, which is even smaller on your graph. Edit: August of 2012.

Everything he *knows* to be true through a lifetime of intellectual accomplishment is at odds with everything you *believe* to be true. I bet people said the same thing about Galileo.
And no, I'm not saying **everything** Krugman says is 100% correct. But your statement above should cause you to re-evaluate what you believe is true.

Either that, or hording is way up because the price is doubling every few days. One of these answers seems more plausible than the other.
