Nice writeup.
I would like to add a point about innovation within the world of alt-coins.  It is true, that if a compelling feature arises from an alt-coin, it might not be possible to port it into the bitcoin core even if it carried obvious benefits that everyone wanted.  If the feature/change requires a fork of the block chain, it requires miner buy-in and I believe the days of forking are either over or will create a gigantic mess.

I had to look up the definition, and I think violence is a fitting term.
"the intentional use of physical force or power, threatened or actual, against oneself, another person, or against a group or community, which either results in or has a high likelihood of resulting in injury, death, psychological harm, maldevelopment, or deprivation."

The point of capital gains is to only pay tax on the difference between the price you buy and the price you sell.  In your case, this would only be worthwhile if the capital gains tax rate is lower than what you would pay for earned income (varies based on other sources of income).  I think capital gains is cheaper than the rates on income, but I'm not sure and of course it depends on your income level.

Correct, it isn't a private entity as in the context of a corporation.  I was drawing a distinction that it isn't the government calling the shots.  I understand it as a separate entity from the government itself though there are presidential appointments to the board, though also compromised of private representatives from commercial banks.  Furthermore, the government does not have the ability to overrule or approve decisions made by the fed and in this way, it is a private entity.

A colored coin is an output that is "marked" and designed as having some special meaning - then tracked as it becomes input into other transactions and on and on.. its just normal bitcoin with the exception that the the transactions are managed in a special way to keep the "colored" coin outputs segregated from the others.  A "normal" bitcoin wallet will determine, by its own logic, which outputs to spend in any given transaction and you could spend a "colored coin" output just the same as any other if sent to a vanilla client.  Hopefully this offers some explanation.
@_date: 2013-03-13 16:11:32
There is more transparency in the overall network &amp; client code than with any service provider or vendor using bitcoin as a means of payment.  With issues like the fork in the block chain, everyone would have immediate knowledge of and equal access to this issue but most people might not be able to asses the significance of issues.
I'm more concerned about individual service providers in the community.  Using an exchange places implicit trust in them with any assets stored with them, vendors must be trusted to deliver the promised goods and services.

You could with an SEP-IRA, its the same thing Mitt Romney used to accumulate his millions and avoiding the tax penalties.  They can be used to purchase real estate, but you must form a corporation for the management of your assets and there are special rules around real estate (e.g. you cannot live it in, it must be an 'investment') but you create a checking account for the entity, and you can buy and sell whatever you want.

They seemed matter-of-fact and even aloof to me, and I think that's totally cool.  I'd be less inclined to hear what they have to say if I felt like I was subjected to a hard-sell, like a timeshare or a used car sales pitch... a person can choose to ignore at their peril and like they say, the value is obvious to those who seek to understand how the bitcoin system works and to those that don't see it or reject it I think are probably going to change their views once the price tells them how wrong they are/were loudly enough.
I didn't take it seriously when I first discovered it (shortly after its release) and I thought I was smart and I've always been a p2p enthusiast, even ran seti on every machine I could back in the day.  When I discovered bitcoin, it appealed to my interests, but I still thought it was just a silly experiment that wouldn't be taken seriously...  I'm sure I'm not the only one with that experience.

I think the biggest advantage, is that it reduces transactional friction.

The fees come from the existing coin in circulation, as the block reward approaches zero the supply from mining will come from these fees which will create ongoing incentive for mining operators and not the baked in block finder's reward.
