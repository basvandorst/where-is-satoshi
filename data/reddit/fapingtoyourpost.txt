I checked their website and it looks like they only do e-commerce.  I'm looking for someone who does what bitpay does, but in meatspace.

Oh, absolutely.  The fact that a great many people break the law has no bearing on what the law actually is, though, which is what I thought we were discussing.

Several states have minimum wage lower than the federal rate.  It's a publicity stunt by conservative politicians.  Federal laws still apply.

Minimum cash wage is the minimum amount of hourly compensation a company can pay an employee who receives tips whose tips and hourly wages combined meet or exceed federal minimum wage. 
Example: If you work in Arkansas an employer can pay you no less than 2.63 an hour if a combination of that 2.63 and hour plus your hourly tip rate are greater than or equal to minimum wage, but if 2.63 an hour + tips comes out to less than minimum wage the employer must pay you the difference.

You are being downvoted because people don't understand the subtle difference between the minimum pre-tip wage a company can pay tipped employees and minimum wage for tipped workers.  It's a tricky one, and the people least equipped to deal with nuance are also the people most likely to be confident that they are correct.

Thanks for the link.  They really ought to include a link to that somewhere on their homepage.  If I had to go through reddit even though I was looking for it I doubt it's an effective advertisement.
