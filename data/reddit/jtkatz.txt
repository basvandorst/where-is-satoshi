Just some additional context about my mom...
She once expressed frustration about getting new apps for her phone because she didn’t want to “go to the app store” (as in, she didn’t want to drive there). She also once asked me why she kept hearing about kids “taking selfies,” assuming they were some kind of new-aged roofie. 
Despite being deeply confused about the world, I still love her ��

I respect her for sure. She just has some unfounded concerns. Don’t mean to make fun - I actually find her texts to be endearing
