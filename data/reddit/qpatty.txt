If someone is corrupt than they took bribes or conmitted another illegal act.  Indict and arrest them for this illegal act.  
Again. AML not needed.

Thank you for this article.  
**How are you sleeping at night now that this is over?** Waking at 7am to fifteen law enforcement agents going through your personal property. 
I just wonder if any knock at the door in the morning continues to worry you and your wife. 
This seems the worst part of it of everything that happened.  How do you go forward?   How does your wife sleep?

Aiding and abetting a criminal conspiracy is a crime.  
@_date: 2018-03-24 08:29:22
Actually just forces the criminals to come up with front businesses and more logical stories.  
Many times they avoid detection because they need to make up things for the banks they wouldn’t have done otherwise. 
@_date: 2018-03-24 16:07:48
Tax evasion in my country is a crime.  
So once again money laundering in your example is not needed as a crime on the books.  Arrest the person for tax evasion.  Arrest the front guy for aiding and abetting tax evasion.  
It’s a massive pain to open bank accounts now.  For the rich and powerful and connected they don’t care as they have teams or accountants or work around. 
For the average joe or small business this creates serious hurdles and some of them are just not worth it.  
On the other side the banks often shut down your account or won’t accept you if the amount isn’t enough to make it worth it for all the paperwork they have to fill out (and pay for someone to do)
We’re conditioned to agree with all laws and think daddy government is protecting us.   Truth is in the case you mentioned and many others money laundering isn’t needed on the books.  Current laws do just fine to stop the crimes (like tax evasion)

Money laundering a dumb crime.  People should free to do whatever they want as long as not hurting others.  Money laundering hurts no one.   
@_date: 2018-03-23 17:22:33
If you’re committing illegal activity than you’re already going to be gone after by law enforcement. 
Anti money laundering laws hurt innocent people way more than stop money laundering.

Money laundering shouldn’t be a crime.  Think about it.

**No social media.**
I’m older though (40) so it doesn’t bother me like it seems to for others. 
I’m interested if there’s a cool new option like one of these new distribute decentralized options that are built on ERC-20 tokens but it seems most are just a ploy to get you to invest.  
If a social media comes along that allows me to keep my data and also lets me pick specifically who and who cannot see my information then I might.  
I know Facebook has some privacy features but obviously overruled easily by the company themselves or law enforcement anytime they like.

There’s very little education on this.  Many people are scared of the IRS and have a right to be.  
As I said there are MANY examples of people trying to avoid the 10k cash limit.  **i would always deposit 11k in cash over 9k in cash anytime and have filled out CTR many times**
But many don’t know this.  A poor guy in Iowa for his account frozen for two years and they took half his money bc he did 9k deposits bc he didn’t want to fill out the paperwork. 
He owned a gas station and would build up to 9k in cash and go deposit it.   
NOW.... if you froze his account and then the next day after explanation opened it.  That maybe would’ve been ok. 
But if you’re in the industry you know MANY casss or innocent people like this guy and others that have had years of their life or their entire lives ruined bc of some miseducation.  
Banks should not be police.  They’re not trained but in 1971 with BSA we decided to totally revamp thousands of years of policy with no public debate.  
KYC is a nice slogan but many are hurt by this and it’s not the rich and owoerful with their teams of accountants.  It’s the average joe or gas station owner that did a dumb thing but did nothing illegal and certainly nothing immoral or unethical.  
Money should not be used a method of control but as method of exchange.  Our government used money laundering and abuses it huge.  
Focus on examples of innocents being abused.  Think of their life with a year or longer with no access to their money and when they call you or your bank they get ZERO ANSWERS and have to go to law enforcement and still get zero answer. 
TLDR. This isn’t about filing out a form. This is about the entire system is corrupt and unfair especially for the lower class person.

You're joking.  The guy deserved 15 police to raid him and his family at 7am for that?    The man violated ZERO laws.  Now we just pick people we don't like and raid them and if it happens then oh well, who cares about the rule of law?
**POLICE MAKE MISTAKES**.  You can be pro-police and still accept this fact.  
Problem is in our system the Feds have so much power it's basically impossible to clear your name when they have a problem.  
Why are you into Bitcoin anyways?  This is a key benefit of Bitcoin

Interesting. I didn’t know this.  
At btc they say their mod policies are open so everything the mods do everyone can see. 
At btc they also say r/bitcoin doesn’t do this.
I find it hard to believe they’re lying over this but if so plz let me know.

Blockchain.info is a super well run company.  It’s also the biggest wallet on earth. 
And unlike Coinbase or other they require ZERO personal information.  Email and that’s it.  Signup with ProtonMail and you’re set.  
I know people who’ve had 100 bitcoin there and has zero issues.  I seriously think you’re misled about this company.  
@_date: 2018-03-13 14:39:57
You’re running way less risk with Linux.  You’re ignoring Microsoft themselves and their spying into your computer folders which they already admitted they do.   
For email it is ok for Microsoft to spy because google does as well?   Protonmail is one fabulous example for email.  Free and doesn’t spy at all and on top of that no ads at all.

As far as open logs the fact that you got them regardless of how bad they berated you shows they do serve a propose.  
An account was banned here for saying we should understand all sides of the scaling issue.  
It got a net 60 thumbs up.  Banned for “deceptive alt coin promotion”
Also.... you’re allowed to fully promote Litecoin as much as you want here.  Anyone who promotes Litecoin is praised.  The alt coin policy is selectively enforced.  
I was on the fence at the time between bitcoin and bitcoin Cash and trying to learn more.  Which way do you think these bans make me move to?  
You should investigate this more.  You’re gonna find a bunch of negative things on both sides. Supporting one side over the other is just blindness IMO.

That’s my point. Money laundering isn’t needed bc by definition another crime is already committed so no need to also prosecute money laundering. 
And anti money laundering laws hurt innocent people way more than stopping money laundering. 
@_date: 2018-03-24 08:31:33
If there are victims it’s already a crime. 
If someone steals $10,000 from you and keeps it cash it’s better than if they take that $10,000 and put it in the bank?
No. Theft is theft.  The additional money laundering crime is a waste.  Just prosecute for theft.  
Money should be a medium of exchange. Not a medium of control and governments and banks are turning it into that.

Oh wow.  I could write a book.  First of all I’m an American who lives overseas and I can’t open a bank account with $1000 in it bc they’re worried about money laundering.  
You’ve seen many people lose their bank accounts bc they did a bitcoin transaction and bank worried about money laundering.  
Some business owners will deposit 9k cash a pop bc they don’t want to fill our paperwork if they go over 10k and they will get their accounts frozen and taken many times bc they think it’s money laundering.  
The feds abuse this power huge.  One guy took his stock accounts from his name and put into his wife’s name and they said they could be money laundering.  
 
Money laundering laws make it hard for banks and others to start new businesses in money services because they have to fill out of a TON of paperwork.  So less market participants are in the market which make sending money more expensive. 
Western Union is basically impossible to use and they want 14 pieces of Id and then they’ll block your name for no reason.  Bc of money laundering. 
As far as “only thing” they can get you on that’s super super rare.  If someone job is money laundering for a drug cartel just get them aiding and abetting a drug cartel.  No need for AML laws and cause tons of issues.  
**this was all off the top of my head but have so many more examples in my life and read about AML hurting people**

Other than that I can admit I highly dislike and comment there often how childish and annoying it is to hate on Bitcoin.

They all have both Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash.  And now Bitcoin Cash has a totally different address structure than Bitcoin.  Bitcoin Cash got the seqwit compatible  addresses before Bitcoin did.

Illegal is not the point.  The point is THEY WERE NOT CHARGED WITH A CRIME.  
Of course CHARGED does not equal GUILTY.  So someone not even charged with a crime should have all their assets frozen with no trial, no way to defend themselves?
This is exactly why Bitcoin is great.

 Indicted and arrested.  
 Then tried by a jury if their peers.  
 If convicted punished.  
No one should ever have their house raided and their property taken without even being arrested and indicted of a crime.  
Law enforcement does this new tactic because if they do arrest you they have to reveal WHY and provide evidence that you can refute.  
So they raid and freeze your funds. Then of course you try to contact the feds to ask WHY frantically but can’t get an answer. This guy is lucky he got an answer after six months.  
Then everyone makes a deal like this guy did.  You can’t find the feds.   This guy has resources and money and that’s the only reason he ain’t in the jail.  **The poor end up in jail!**. Is that fair?  Is that just?
Not sure if you’re American but that’s how our constitution was made to work.   It’s a work around where the less well off end up in jail and the rich pay a fine. 
This is exactly why I got into Bitcoin.

But then the author undermined his entire point.  He called Bitcoin Cash BCASH.  Well.  Bitcoin Cash says they don’t want to be call that.  Just as Bitcoin doesn’t want to be called Bitcoin Core.
