My understanding is that if transactions link A to B, and B to C, then it is straightforward to determine that money has passed from A to C. All bitcoins can be traced back, through every owner, to their original time of creation.

I think you understand it just fine. The article acknowledged this point. If you own enough of the market, then making any large moves will have a significant impact on the overall market. If he sold all of it at once, the price would indeed go down during the process of fulfilling his sell order, and he would get less than the stated $3M. I'm not sure how much, exactly.

It's called dollar cost averaging and it's more a technique to minimize *regret* than to minimize actual risk. If you're tempted to use DCA to lower your risk, then you're probably ignoring the real problem, which is that the asset in which you're investing is too risky for you.

My understanding is that obfuscation isn't generally a successful legal tactic. You can tell the judge and jury "I was just manipulating bits and performing mathematical operations on my computer!", but it doesn't really matter if you obviously, deliberately committed some act that deprives other people of their property or breaks a contract you entered into. Common sense actually does prevail.

The hashing speed is the same. Mining doesn't need much bandwidth. PCIE x4 is perfectly adequate. You just need to cut the plastic end off to get the card to physically fit in the slot.

It's anyone's guess whether bitcoins will be worth $17 or $5 or $100 6 months from now -- and that will make all the difference. We could be mining "easy money" right now without realizing it, or we could be completely wasting our time and electricity.  Or something in between.  It's simply a gamble that happens to be fun for computer nerds to indulge in.  Anyone who expects *reliable* returns from anything bitcoin-related is a fool.
@_date: 2011-08-03 18:07:08
I don't understand what was bad about this. Someone sold tons of bitcoins and the price temporarily plummeted. It was a great chance for people to grab some cheap bitcoins and easy profit. Haven't you ever heard "buy low, sell high"?

Just note that these cards (and all other bitcoin-for-gift-card things I've seen) have about a 10% fee. That's pretty outrageous. You'd be much better off cashing out through Tradehill or MtGox or whichever.

Yeah. I opened accounts at MtGox and Dwolla many days ago, and I'm just twiddling my thumbs waiting for a little money to transfer.
My mining gear will get here tomorrow.  It may turn out that ordering computer equipment from across the country, building it, and getting it running, will be faster than executing a purely electronic transaction. Pathetic.

Good work. Another place I saw with this type of comparison is [this site]( but I think your price efficiency calculations are more useful. I did similar calculations, but just threw away my work after I decided what I wanted... I went with the 5770 due to its nice balance between power (HEAT.. summer is here), low cost, and mining efficiency.
Might be easier to read if you fix the number of decimal places.

No one knows. The question really is: how will the price of bitcoins change in the future?  If it goes up quite a bit, then buying more video cards is a good idea. If it stays stable, then maybe not so much. If it goes way down, then definitely not. But no one knows which will happen.
I think that bitcoin is an inherently valuable system, and that it could be put to good use by many more people than it currently is used by, so basically it has huge potential for growth. I really mean huge. It could be a global game changer. Also, the inherent limit of the number of bitcoins means that if demand stays constant (at the very least), then the value of each bitcoin will gradually go up, so it's a good idea to get your hands upon as many as you can right now. Then again, despite its use of cryptography, there is some small chance that a fatal, yet-to-be-discovered flaw in its design could make it useless and worthless at some point in the future.
So, in short, no one can really answer your question. It's up to you to judge the situation and try to predict the future to the extent possible.
As for me, I'm mining with a single reused machine where I only had to buy a video card and upgrade the power supply. I feel that investing any more than that in mining is too risky and uncertain.  But that's just my gut feeling, and I see the whole thing as nothing more than an amusing hobby. Any money earned is icing on the cake. (I've been mining for over a month and I'm still over $100 in the red.)

But the thing is, using the same settings isn't a direct comparison in any kind of useful way. Anyone doing their due diligence will research/test various settings and use whatever's best for their card. So a fair comparison would find the best settings for each card and THEN compare them.
The community has already figured out which cards are best. This article is a day late and a dollar short.

That's several months, not really day-to-day. There are many green and red bars in that chart. Some days it goes up, some days it goes down. In terms of trying to guess what will happen in the next few days (even barring major news events), it's not much clearer than randomness.

I take this cautiously optimistic view as well. However, it's still an unknown, and is solely in the realm of speculative gambling, not investing. No important money should be put into bitcoin.

Ah, I've got it. You have to use the GUI to create your settings, but you can then load the settings via the command line from then on, by using the -b option. Underclocking memory to 300mhz dropped me ~3 degrees celsius, which is nice but not exactly amazing... then again, I have the fan running 100% since the machine is in the basement, so maybe memory speed isn't as important for me.
@_date: 2011-06-16 05:12:19
It depends on the future value of a bitcoin. If that remains the same, then yeah, it would essentially play out as you describe.

Day-to-day fluctuations in larger markets are often indistinguishable from noise. I'm not sure if that can be said of the much smaller bitcoin market though.

Credit card interchange is what, about 2-3%? That seems reasonable. 10% would be high but maybe tolerable for an early adopter thing like this. Any higher than 10% or so is just unreasonable.
Compare to other financial products:
* Credit card interchange: 2-3% (one time)
* Mutual fund expense ratios: 0.05%-5.0% (per year)
* Credit card interest (high end): 30% (per year, only if you keep a balance)
Yeah these are apples and oranges, but still... a 40% cut for anything related to finance is just crazy. I can't imagine many real world scenarios where it would be worth it.

I'm not trying to argue ideology or monetary theory; just making a simple practical point. Nothing I personally pay for was drastically more expensive 3 years ago. But the difference in cost of everyday things from 40 years ago is enormous. Regardless of my own layman's fuzzy estimate of recent inflation, it's inarguable that 40 years of inflation is far greater than 3 years.
