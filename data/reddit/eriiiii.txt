I really really hope so... it's such an obvious legal loophole that it sickens me... hopefully it'll be before the statute of limitations has passed for shit happening now forcing people into arbitration. the doc hot coffee was really eye opening about this binding arbitration shit we all agree to but have no idea what it is until something happens to us... even hospitals get to get away with this... which is beyond crazy to me... gotta protect those poor doctors... 
edit: private hospitals, state run hospitals can't have the binding arbitration clause nor can any state run business 
also, when you buy any product, you don't even have to sign anything or agree to anything. simply by using their product you are bound to their terms of use, which almost always include binding arbitration... the onus is on you to look up what the terms of use are.
kid dies from a faulty crib? here take a gift certificate for the next one, so sorry

if you actually read the iCloud tos, it has an arbitration clause... any lawsuit would go to an arbitrator of apple's choosing because you agreed to that.
and yes, every single other cloud service has the same clause... hell every fucking tos I've read in the last 5 years has that clause
