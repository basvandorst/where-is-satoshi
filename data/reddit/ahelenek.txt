A netflix like service that no one uses.

Dont use arstechnica, wired or guardian, but I do pay for forbes, have given out ~70 gold, and had gold on my own account for several years, recently ran out. If I find myself being an active user of their site, I always pay for ad-free. I also run an ad blocker on those who force it down my throat with no option to disable.

I dream of a day when websites have a paid ad-free version of their website so I don't have to deal with third parties and can sleep comfortably knowing the cash was sent directly to them.

What I'm interested in is how long will it take before I can accept bitcoin from valve as a workshop artist. That would be so dope!
@_date: 2016-04-26 00:28:06
I don't think they rolled it out in the US yet, I don't have the option either. The wait is killin' me!!

Your first mistake was coming here for news.
@_date: 2018-05-03 18:28:28
From a sheer marketability view, I hate the name. Everything else looks solid.
@_date: 2016-01-11 04:28:56
You think something like that is possible? And lets say it did, what would happen to coinbase, and more importantly, our bitcoins? 
@_date: 2016-01-11 07:48:26
I'm still fairly new to the whole bitcoin thing, been following it for years only started buying this fall. Is something like [Ledger Wallet]( good for that? 
@_date: 2017-03-24 13:51:49
You must be new here.
@_date: 2016-06-04 03:57:04
Agreed. Did the same thing today as well.

@_date: 2016-06-15 00:12:52
Well played.
@_date: 2016-06-09 17:11:52
That's awesome! I'd pick one up.
@_date: 2017-01-31 21:53:04
There should be a website like that obituaries one except for people making stupid claims like this one.

Have you though about selling enough to get your initial investment back and holding the rest as pure gains? 
@_date: 2017-01-22 14:28:44
This is something everyone should consider doing. Lowering the cost of entry by simply using a smaller unit of bitcoin will only make it more appealing across the board.
@_date: 2016-12-22 04:51:30
*love you*
@_date: 2018-06-05 13:56:08
About time.
@_date: 2016-06-07 15:05:02
Why am I looking at ~$87 per share right now then? 
@_date: 2016-12-24 06:13:45
Buy directly from them and when you get it in the mail make sure the seal hasn't been tampered with.
@_date: 2017-11-01 03:05:20
I only come for the memes.
@_date: 2016-02-11 05:26:26


This is totally legitimate seeing that the parody didn't recreate it in their own light, but took theirs and merely swapped logos.
@_date: 2016-02-09 02:25:31
I was just thinking this to myself a few days ago.
@_date: 2018-11-16 22:46:23
What break do they need? They're overvalued.
@_date: 2017-05-25 17:54:24
**THIS.** **IS.** **BITCOIN.**
@_date: 2018-12-17 22:19:20
If you have to ask, the answer is probably no.
