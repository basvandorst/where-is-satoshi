What fundamental value do any cryptos hold? The problem is that essentially any company can make one with enough resources. And when the market is flooded with new coins it returns to the same problem as fiat--- it is only as good as the trust in the company/image behind them.    
And there may not be "inflation" as we know it with cryptocurrency (there is a set limit number of Bitcojns, for instance), but there is no set limit on the number of cryptocurrencies. In that way, cryptocurrencies will lose their value in much the same way. People will hold them, they suck (right now) as a medium exchange, so as supply/demand trends change, the currency price will inflate or deflate. Except, its not as predictable as fiat inflation, how is that better?

Seriously, loss aversion is a pretty basic idea in behavioural finance. This post is a perfect example of it.

Except the value of noodles is derived from its consumption, instead of an intangible asset propped up by speculation

Wow, its almost as if juxtaposing two different positions is healthy journalism. You notice how its two different parties claiming different things? There is no contradiction here.
