I think there's isn't such a thing so far. 
@_date: 2016-04-25 17:05:09
I think $40 for one week it a lot so I don't believe that could happen. 
@_date: 2016-04-25 17:13:14
If that happened, they are lost forever. It's the same thing as you lost you private key . 
@_date: 2016-04-25 17:13:49
Circle or localbitcoins or gemini. 
@_date: 2016-04-25 16:41:18
Yes it's going up so fast. 
@_date: 2016-04-25 17:22:28
I think donate button for bitcoin looks a little bit scammy. 
@_date: 2016-04-25 17:16:37
Great, thanks for you help. 
@_date: 2016-04-25 16:40:36
It stronger than ever I'm sure. 
@_date: 2016-04-25 16:37:15
Price is heading up...
@_date: 2016-04-25 17:23:12
I think this is scam, localbitcoins is secure service.
@_date: 2016-04-25 17:24:34
This is so funny, thanks for sharing. 
@_date: 2016-04-25 16:54:40
Install electrum and everything will be fine. Or try with mycelium or multibit hd
@_date: 2016-04-25 16:40:12
@_date: 2016-04-25 17:03:37
And what will be improved compared to Bitmessage?

Ebay holds the right to cancel any auctions and terminate the account if they find out the information is linked to OpenBazaar somehow. The eBay TOS clearly state “including contact details or an offer to buy or sell an item outside of eBay” is not allowed, and a violation of their policy.
@_date: 2016-04-25 16:50:15
Yes it was a really interesting weekend and price escalated so quickly. 
@_date: 2016-04-25 17:08:07
Well it a great service and for sure you should create it, well it not a legal way so far but it will work and probably will not have any problems in near feature. 
@_date: 2016-04-20 17:46:28
It works fine, maybe it's just you.
@_date: 2016-04-25 17:09:59
SO there's not "And they lived happily ever after."
@_date: 2016-04-25 16:38:30
This will be a great option and I hope both sides will win using these feature.
@_date: 2016-04-25 17:21:49
You can do it by trading them person to person.

@_date: 2016-04-25 17:16:07
Well it's not such a great feature.
@_date: 2016-04-25 17:12:01

@_date: 2016-04-25 16:48:15

@_date: 2016-04-25 17:05:50
So do you find a solution on this ?
@_date: 2016-04-20 17:31:06
I think e-coin is still without competition so far.
@_date: 2016-04-20 17:10:23
Nice cast, great trailer, looks promising, I'll give it a chance for sure.
@_date: 2016-04-25 17:00:20

@_date: 2016-04-25 16:51:14
Around $518 it's the highest expectation, 30k is too much or he thought august 2030 ?
@_date: 2016-04-25 17:02:05
