I agree. Bitcoin is not practical TODAY as a store of value, neither it is for (small) purchases. I never stated the opposite.
What I've written (below) is that "In the long term Bitcoin has a pretty good chance of being highly demanded as a store of value, alternative asset or even as a currency". That's it. It's an experiment in the way to consolidation.
The exception would be situations when  alternatives are even more volatile and risky (highly devalued fiat currencies), or in cases where there is no access to banking services. In those circumstances Bitcoin could be practical even right now.

Thank you for your answer. What you describe is sure very safe, but hardly convenient for the rank and file. Creating raw transactions must be complicated and exposed to human errors.
I'm trying to find a balance between safety and simplicity.
I understand that just using a hardward wallet is already very safe, even with an infected mobile. My only concerns are copy-paste malware and having to key in seeds. Keying in seeds can be avoided or done with "advanced seed recovery" in Trezor. The problem of copy-paste address tampering remains and I've read that the solution is checking addresses through a second channel.

My concern is that somebody steals my coins, rather than being spied by the CIA.
I know about risk of negligence. I'm trying to make a kind of simple safety protocol for my coins so that I can be confident and relaxed.

Germans come to Spain on holidays and order a 1 liter beer bottle for dinner in the hotel. Then they drink half of it, write a mark at the level of the remaining beer (just in case) and demand to be served the same bottle the following day.

Ecuador's government already created an "official" cryptocurrency that completely failed because nobody wanted it. That was like 3 years ago.
Ecuadorians want Bitcoin, so much more after Bitcoin was banned in the country.
The new coin called the "Petro" is not a cryptocurrency. It is just a digital asset backed by a corrupt unreliable and incompetent government.
The new coin has more to do with bypassing international sanctions or paying debt to China and Russia than with solving hyperinflation.

Okey. The difficult part would be to pass transactions from one device to the other.
I would need an android mobile wallet app that encodes unsigned transactions in the form of a QR core, and then another wallet (or the same) that can read transactions from QR codes. 
The second one must allow signing with a hardward wallet.
Any suggestion?

Decentralized continuous voting. 
You can change your vote any time you want and nobody can interfere. No elections, no frauds, Total anonimity. Politicians get in and out of parliament in real time. Even better, they no longer decide, *we* decide. They just do the paperwork, and maybe advice us on twitter. Presidents are no longer necessary, only experts (on economics, military, police...) that we appoint directly. Legislation is discussed in reddit. Taxation is squared in google drive shared spreadsheets. Demonstrations are useless (against whom?). International crisis are sorted out with the aid of google translator. The new XXI-century cyber-swiss democracy!

The 1% are productive or the heirs of the productive. Their entrepreneurial pursuits create most things we use. They make ourselves richer by producing increasingly affordable goods and services. What's more, the 1% likely contributes north of roughly 20% taxes. Then some offended people grab the money, spit in their faces and shout: "you filthy rich, you should be ashamed of hoarding money, it's your duty to pay for all of my welfare"

"The number of millionaires in the world, according to Credit Suisse, is 36m. Their total wealth is $128.7 trillion. If millionaires collectively decided to hold just 1% of their wealth as bitcoin, the price would be not $15,000 but north of $60,000. If they raised that to 5%, the right price for bitcoin would be above $300,000"

As of now, it is not practical for small purchases, especially on the premises.
Think of this: people use gold as a store of value. That's it, to hold their savings for future use. They also buy gold as a safe haven asset. Storing gold is expensive. Buying and selling gold has steep transaction costs. And yet its use is widespread. In India they know what I'm talking about.

If you get a receipt of the payment you can demand a refund.
Also, with transaction reversal there is risk of fraud on the part of the buyer.
So all in all, isn't the customer making sure of the merchant's reputation (so that no fraud is committed) an easier way of doing business than the merchant making sure about the customer's honesty?
