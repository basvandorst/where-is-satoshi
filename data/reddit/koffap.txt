It finally makes sense! 
You're saying HODL until 2140. 
Got it!

EXACTLY! The whole point of BTC was to leave fiat behind. Little by little, BTC and other crypos will gain acceptance at retail and online stores, and you’ll need only to transfer small amount to a Wallet on your phone and use that in place of cash or credit cards. By spending it, you release it back into circulation.

These CNBC folks have been reporting on complex financial markets and dividends for years. There’s NO way they don’t understand Bitcoin. If I’m in big banking, and I see the writing on the BTC wall, I would press the producers of these shows to direct the hosts to steer the conversation AWAY from bitcoin, and back to the US dollar and traditional banking. I think that’s what we’re watching here. 
They saw what happened to music and print media. You can’t expect them not to use this as a forum to fight back.

Yes, once your coins are on the device I believe they are very safe.

That all sounds good.
There are several routes you could have taken (i.e. Gemini or Kraken in place of Coinbase), but your plan is solid. 
If you are buying/trading crypto, don't forget the obvious vulnerabilities such as using an off-the -shelf inexpensive router, or not using a VPN/Tor when using an exchange.

The folks who buy in at 10,000 will envy your getting in early at a mere 4900.

"Nobody will ever buy a phone made by Apple, they're a computer company, not a phone company"
When people in power don't understand a new technology, they attempt to discredit it in the hopes that other people will see them as a reliable resource of information.
It's not just the big banks, it's Visa, American Express and the huge gift card market that needs to worry.

Dude, good on ya for investing in your future. It's always hard to let a bike go, especially anything Orange.

Haha. Yeah, took me a while to learn about internet security. Since there is no third party to protect your coins, you need to beef up your personal security. 
One way is to anonymize your IP address via a Virtual Private Network or using the Tor Browser. 
Reddit is littered with folks posting about missing coins. Having a laptop that's infected with malware or being hacked in some other way is one vulnerability you need to mitigate.

The Ledger comes with a Lambo. Just fill it with coins, gently shake and wait.

I'm new to this, but I've been reading, listening and watching everything I can find. 
I believe it's about thinking long term.
Sure, you buy at the dips, when it's on sale, and you dollar-cost-average for when it's sideways or moving up. The point is to accumulate. 
Bitcoin will ultimately become the currency that will be accepted everywhere Visa is accepted, and will then surpass it. The point is to never sell and convert to fiat again, you'll just do business in Bitcoin. 
Right now a minuscule percentage of the global economy lives in crypto, but once it receives widespread adoption and bigger institutions take on more crypto, and more and more people do things like convert their IRAs to crypto, the market cap will rise exponentially, allowing your few BTC to be worth enough to allow you to shop for food and gas using a few Satoshis. 
It's not just about HODLing, that's just a comfort measure to help you weather the dips when you don't fully buy in to the future of bitcoin.

You're right, I was referring more to the delay in processing to and from banks. You can exit through PayPal on Coinbase if I recall.

The expedient way to help security or law enforcement do their job is to not answer every question with a question.

Right, and then they read about the hacks, and the bubble, and the "civil war infighting" and they say screw it, it must be a scam and they bail, only to find out (and freak out) that it ain't as easy to get your money out, as it was to get in.

The problem is, at least in the US, Coinbase is the easiest and most reliable on-ramp to crypto. 
For new folks, you have to do some digging to figure out how to first acquire assets, then where to store them, then where to trade them. 
For the average Joe, who is used to an eTrade or Schwab account, there just isn't something as simple. 
Kraken and Gemini are the closest parallels. But getting fiat into those through ACH or wire transfer is a fuckparty. Even the FAQ gives poor guidance. 
So, I suspect Coinbase gets all the traffic from wallets like Copay and sites like Bitcoin.org, especially since you can use a credit card to get instant crypto.

Would you mind letting us know if it worked? I made the same switch (and paid the fees) and I really like Exodus. I heard Vorhees talk about Shapeshift which is built-in to Exodus. Helped me learn about Altcoins as well.
