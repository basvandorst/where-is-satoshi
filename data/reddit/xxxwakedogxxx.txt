I believe, if nodes were made cheap and already assembled in an easy to use kit, then it would increase adoption significantly. Of course, there would need to be a good advertising campaign to spread the word.
A Raspberry Pi kit is a perfect start for the brave and willing.
Thanks u/loobooloo for the Raspibolt link:

Thanks for the link Aussiehash
I was wondering if it was a lot of transactions being processed, more than usual

Here's what I am seeing on coinmarketcap.com:
Crypto prices all going up and down in almost 'identical' patterns. Percentages of the top 100+ market cap coins that mirror each other and go up and down almost in unison.
To me, this tells me there is BIG money, possibly by one or a few whales in a lot of these tokens/coins. Their bots or traders put money into all or most of these coins at once, creating an illusion of a bull market return. For all of these coins/tokens to go up on so many tokens, in unison, and then go back down in unison, is pretty obvious what's happening.
Yes, the market is driven on news and emotion, but look closer - these patterns of up and down prices on coinmarketcap.com and Coinbase are following each other too tightly to be just news driven. 
Plus, there are 'Pump and dump' groups pumping a lot of coins, then dumping for profit.

Great job man
From that screenshot, I can see your ports are not forwarded to the node, from your router. Or, your router does not support UPnP. 
You could forward the ports below to your LND node. Not required, but makes your node easier to see on LND explorers (and probably other stuff)

If this works, it will be similar to businesses like fundrise.com. Shared purchases of real estate on a blockchain is a good idea - imo

\- Mine with a graphics card
\- Don't mine BTC directly (not worth it) but mine altcoins and trade for BTC
\- Use apps like Cudo Miner, NiceHash, or Honey Miner
\- Sign up with Coinbase and do 'Cryto learning videos/questions'. Earn about $15-$20 in Altcoins and trade for BTC
\- Bitcoin faucets are rare, don't pay out much, and some are scams
\- Research more in Reddit   =)

Not sure if this is legit but it's high in Google search rankings for Bitcoin surveys
