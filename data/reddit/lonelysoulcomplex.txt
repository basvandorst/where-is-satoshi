@_date: 2018-08-17 11:48:39
It's a meme and is only half serious. 
Some people are not made for trading and are prone to panic selling at a lost/buying too much during fomo. Others are simply uninterested in day trading.
Hodling is a strategy for those. You believe in bitcoin tech wise but can't care or are terrible at trading? Invest an amount you can lose, never sell, use it instead when it becomes mainstream/adopted to buy for stuff. It might never happen, but it's way less risky/a better strategy, imo, than day trading if you suck.

Off "chase" that it will go viral again?,
It was never viral as an investment/asset. People talked about it but buying some was such a shit process, most people gave up half way : probably when coinbase wouldn't validate them because the platform was so unstable. By the time exchanges fixed their shit, BCH got on coinbase at a ridiculous starting price after being insider traded : that's what bursted the bubble, before average dude could buy in. At that point, they were all too scared 2 months after no one is talking about it anymore.
Add to that that there was tons of problem with bitcoin being super slow and expensive to transact from 4k all the way to 20k and back down to 10k... 
Bitcoin going on a bull run is always why it gets "viral" for some months. Going viral never caused a bull run. Next time tho (if it happens : maybe never, but I'd be surprised) it will be much easier for average dude to buy in. Also, it will be super fast and easy to use by then. It already is compared to last winter.

Not how it works. More energy to mine = less reward when difficulty adjust. New miners in the market because or a rise in awereness might increase the energy consumption, but not relative to the price. Mining more =/= more rewards on a grand scale. Higher price =/= more energy needed. 
@_date: 2018-08-16 20:57:22
Or you can zoom out on the graph and realise that it's bs. 
Also, we are getting closer and closer to 2020.
186% inflation in the past year is terrible. If Bitcoin heads there too, it will be terrible. Check the same time frame tho and you'll realise that bitcoin is up a decent amount in a year. Pretty good compared to 186% inflation.
@_date: 2018-05-31 19:53:29
What a dumb thing to say.
That's the whole logic behind all of it. Governement can stop people "cashing",out easily. But, by the time they feel the need to, there will be no reason to cash out. Why would you cash out if you can buy food and pay your rent with it, while USD is just going down and down every year by design? 
Make it illegal for business to accept? They don't have that power. Beside, they would only try something that dumb in a desperate time : meaning that it would be too late. 
You can't just "ban" bitcoin. You can try and fail. At best. Look at Venezuela. You think the US will be harsher than them? Because, even them they couldn't stop it.
@_date: 2018-08-05 21:12:17
Again, it's just pr bullshit. It doesn't matter. Bitcoin is just more convenient for everyone after a move like that. 
@_date: 2018-08-12 07:19:45
Them having less BTC than before to sell because they already did is bearish...? What?
25 000 btc compared to what they had before is nothing. Even if they cashed out everything, BTC would be fine... There would be a drop, sure, but BCH would drop as much and since most of their holding is BCH now, they would go basically bankrupt. 
BCH was pegged to BTC (0.1000 almost exactly) and it wasn't natural. Seems like they used bot to keep it afloat, buying BCH with BTC to keep it pegged. Seems like they ran out of gas and feels like there is no where else but down for BCH now, baring a weird final pump with most of their remeaning holding and a following fomo. But them cashing out BCH or trading back to BTC to stay afloat seems more likely. Since they own 6-7% of the entire supply with low liquidity, a cash out of BCH from them probably kills BCH in an hour, I suspect they will do it slowly instead, going back to BTC by peggging it down to 0.09 then 0.08 and etc in the next few months.

People will expect a dumb. 
Mark my words. By the time all the claims are taking care of and they are ready to pay back (another 2 years?)... It won't matter that much. Bitcoin will be much higher then and people will be mad they are paid mostly in USD. Forks and BCH will be worth near zero so people won't even worry about selling them and BTC will be in the midst of a bull run, so a lot will just keep their BTC.
Also, still possible those claims will still never get paid back.
@_date: 2018-05-10 05:56:11
You are either a fan of BCH or you are just dense.
The whole point is that Bitcoin.com wasn't owned by any "bitcoin autorithy" in 2010 so it is of course still not today. The domain changing hand since then only means that someone bought it with money and that there is no guarantee that bitcoin.com has any legitimacy, while, at least in the past, bitcoin.org was proclaimed as legitimate. 
Also, Bitcoin.com is a BCH website, it's obvious, so it is still not "directly related" to BTC and there is no guarantee that any of the content is honest. That Satoshi post only explains that the .com domain is owned by the one that bought it first and be, legally, used in any way to help or harm bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-08-14 22:20:37
Your argument is ludicrous. % is all that matters. It's not the first time for bitcoin. It can go back up to a new ath in no time. Of course, nothing is guarantee. That means that "popped for good" is not a garantee either. Actually, if anything, it shows how resilient some of the holders are.
Maybe next time more will have learned that while btc is amazing it's not a get rich quick scheme. Less fomo and a more natural climb is better for everyone, but I doubt it. Noobs are always the same : scared when it's low and overexcited and buying more when it's high.

No one argues that bitcoin is widely used yet. We argued that it could be in the future because it make sense. And, if it ever does, it's gonna go up by more than another 1000%. Probably way more than that. Bitcoin is a bet, but a bet that I would consider educated because I feel confident that the potential return is high enough and likely enough to justify the risk if you only buy in with an amount you can afford to lose.
Would you bet on red at the casino if red was 50% but would pay 10x but had to wait 10 years for the result and could only participate once? Sure, you can lose your bet, but still, sounds like a smart bet to me if you can manage the risk.

Secure as in : Not controlled by a single entity, not at the mercy of two guys holding most of the supply and the only one mining it at all.
The tech is virtually the same. The only difference is that Bitcoin Cash as bigger blocks and doesn't have segwit. Bigger blocks also means that, while cheaper, without an offchain solution, it is virtually impossible to manage let's say 10% of what VISA transact daily without becoming as expensive as Bitcoin was last year without segwit. Bigger bocks is a "band-aid" solution and has an enormous downside : the bigger the blocks are, the less nodes you will have, which, security wise, is beyond stupid.
And if you think it is similar to "15 characters password vs 16"...  no, it's not, at all. A few months ago Bitcoin cash was overtaken in mining power by a fork without double spending protection. Since then, mining power of Bitcoin Cash is even lower than it was, meaning it's even easier to do it again and again. All of that is because Bitcoin Cash is a disaster security and centrality wise.
Now those tradeoffs also applies to all the other alt-coins, in the same way. You can't be free or extremly cheap to transact, have as high of a volume as bitcoin and also be  remotely secure enough without an off chain option. Not with the technology we have now. Maybe eventually, but I doubt it, since Bitcoin can just evolve and steal that technology for itself if it is ever developped and proves to be stable/successful on an hypothetical alt coin. 
@_date: 2019-03-20 02:57:09
It's not backward.
Here is how it went there :
Bitcoin was transacted 40% less without electricity in Venezuela. 60% was still transacted. How? Satelitte/Smartphone/Data usage. It is not as convenient, but as long as your phone as battery you will be able to transact. That's way way better than the banks being literally non functional in any way.
Yes, if you can find someone that accept USD cash, it was better in term of convenience. But it's highly illegal and much easier to get caught that having some bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-10-21 01:06:30
And they pay electricity/employees/rent how?
@_date: 2018-10-21 01:11:30
Maybe because most players are chinese? Make sense that most cheaters would be, also. 
@_date: 2018-10-29 00:40:07
But a whale pump and dumping is only a problem because bitcoin is valued usd and volume is low. All of that is temporary and every smart person realise that. Is going to be for 5 years? 20? 100? Hard to guess. But, fiat has literally zero benefit over crypto once crypto is widely adopted.
@_date: 2019-03-15 14:07:53
There were people on both side of the argument.
The expectation of it seemed to have caused the 2017 bullrun. The implantation of it seemed to have started the bear market. We will see how the "delisting" affects it. My guess? Won't do shit.
You have to understand that it was all settled in cash, therefore had no direct impact on the "price". My guess is that a big whale bought an enormous amount before futures opened up for the first time, with the plan of slowly selling it all at the same time that the MTGO bitcoins were dumped. That whale knew that then the crash would crash a lot, there he was shorting the future and selling his bitcoins that he bought before the bullrun that he himself caused. But, even before all of that crazy hype, price was around 9k. Now where is the actual natural value? 0$? 1k? I believe it's actually somewhere around 8-9k : where we were before CBOE futures were officialy announced. 
We are now in the longest sideway trading we had since the 200-400$ period. Multiple months of not doing anything (compared to the usual volatility) but trading volume is on the rise, same for the transaction volume. Last time, it skyrocketed after the long "non-volatile" phase. It doesn't mean that it will happen this time, but, my best bet is that it will again to a new high by the end of 2021. Back to 9k by the end of 2019. 
Or maybe bitcoin just collapse. Whatever, really : if you are smart enough, you realise that it's an enormous risk and only keep what you can afford to lose. 
Personnaly, I will never sell. I will keep all of it until I can use it as a currency at my local shops and on my favorite websites. It could be never or it could be worth 100x what it is now. One of the other.

If you don't understand how privacy is more and more of a concern in our day and age then you are a lost cause. 
Yes, we are free to leave the bank that start those shady things. Exactly. And we all should. That's the whole point. It's easy enough to grasp. 
Nothing to do with conspiracy. Bank can't be trusted. Has been obvious to most people for a long time. Problem was and still is that there is no other reliable option... Yet. Cryptos will eventually do everything they do and more for much cheaper and without the need to trust any party. It's just a matter of time. Most banks realise that too. That's why they will adapt or try to milk the cow dry before it dies.
@_date: 2018-10-29 00:15:55
It's been debunked many times that those are used "only by criminals", for once. 
Influencers or whoever is corrupt in the crypto sphere DOESN'T matter. Corrupt bankers can steal your fund. Steal your identity. Control USD. No one can do that to a decentralised crypto. You don't need to trust math and math is what is governing a good crypto, nothing else.
The argument that "if you are nothing to hide you should be transparent" is also the dumbest argument ever. How about them selling that data? How about that data being leaked widely? How about government using that data to influence and manipulate you? Facilitating the use of propaganda by finding exactly the best way to influence you? Soon, how about AI using those datas to determine how likely you are to become a criminal following a statistical analysis and jailing you before you even do anything illegal, simply because of how likely you are to? How about jailing you for a crime that shouldn't be a crime? You realise that homosexuality is still a crime in some country? What if a corrupt government decide that it becomes a crime again and they have all they need to jail and execute all of them?
Let's all be transparent about everything. Then, if a crazy fuck gets elected, he can slowly take control of everything, without anyone having any hope of starting a rebellion and protesting without being caught right away. Sounds wonderful.

You are shortsighted. Privacy will probably be the biggest concern there is soon enough, with AI and robotic removing the use for most of the workers.
But I don't have the will or the energy to waste my time trying to convince you. You do you. In the meantime, everyone that is smart enough, even the bankers that you trust so much and the government that you believe not to be corrupt, will invest their savings in sound money and adapt, while you keep believing in your good old USD, Debit card and papermoney right until the end, when that won't be worth the paper it is printed on. And when you use it to start your fire to boil your water and warm your family, then maybe you will realise. I hope you do before that for your sake.

That exact research never implies that 20k was the result of manipulation. 20k is never stated. It implies that probably and within an acceptable statistical significance, some amount of money (undefined) was buying trying to sell back short term with algorythm, causing slightly inflated price for a short time. 
Here is the thing : it's called a fucking market. Every single fucking market ever acts the same. Since volume is low for bitcoin while hype is high (most people know of it, only a really small amount of people actually dabble in it money wise) it is easier move the market a lot with less risk/initial investment. 
nothing new and nothing that wasn't super predictable. Nothing that scientificaly prove that 20k was the result of a "single entity manipulating to his advantage all by himself to screw everyone over" like you were implying. More likely, what the research has found (correlation wise) is due to bot and they are aware of it.
How about reading the article next time?

Most people don't understand how internet works, most people don't understand how to cook, most people don't understand most things... and you know what? It doesn't matter, they still dabble into it. 
Crypto is the same. You can do tons of research and yes probably good idea if you plan on putting all your savings into it... For now... But you can download coinbase app or any other wallet out there and put a little money and use it for transaction. It's easy as fuck and it's as safe as any other currency out there. It's what is and will happen.

No reason that they would have done it more in 2018 than before, really. Actually, I'm sure at least as many people consolidated in a single wallet now that transaction are cheaper than whales splitting on "many wallets to boost confidence of investors". Whales wouldn't care about a 10$ fee. Someone consolidating smaller amount would.
Even a whale has such a low impact compared to exchanges. 
It seems much more likely that this bump from 6 to 8% is due to people taking out their fund from exchanges. Which is a great thing.
@_date: 2019-02-13 16:49:12
No way to be sure but why would wealthy individuals suddenly split their wealth in 50% more wallet?

Volume of transaction? When has it ever influenced price? 
Volume that traders and investors care about is the one on exchanges. Exchange is a single big wallet, each, and is the biggest reason why 99% of wealth is on 8% of wallet.

It's not only a "mild decelaration in the inflation rate". It's more than that. Bitcoin volume is quite low as a whole, people hodl way more than they day trade. The equilibrium between daily Buys/Sells is fragile. Miners need capital to run as a business, therefore they probably sell daily and probably represent most of the "selling" volume. When the halvening happens, that volume will be cut in half instantly. Even if everything else is ignored (hype, daytrading, etc) it's a huge impact on the offer/demand of the equation. It will for sure cause a significant increase in price even without any higher demand, by halving the supply in circulation.
@_date: 2019-04-01 12:52:25
You can spend it, and then your balance can be in the red when they revert it.
Also, you pay a crazy amount of fees, around 7-8% average, if you are doing international business with fiat. Normally 4% or 150$ flat fee + another 4% for conversion (normally hidden in that instance, too). 
On top of that, 2% inflation more or less per year.
Also BTC on lighting is truly instant and almost free.
Yes, fiat is "better" for convenience, for now, since it is accepted everywhere. Beside that tho...
@_date: 2019-04-03 09:15:32
Yeah, yeah...
Except those "boners" are nothing compared to the price movements of most of Bitcoin life time.
Volatility is high and volumes are sufficiently low that a single whale deciding to invest a reasonable amount is enough to create that price movement that we saw. Then, yes, fomo sets in. Fomo is not manipulation.
If you believe every time bitcoin goes 10% up it's manipulation and bound to crash back, then you are just another one of those salty idiots who kept crying that bitcoin is dead and going to zero since it first got to 10$.

"The price is only the result of manipulation"
What kind of manipulation? Buying low and selling high? So, like, a market? 
Price manipulation doesn't matter at all. Only negatively affect day traders that are trying to make a living off price movements. The average yearly price will still follow adoption and tech progression. And, if the expected adoption and tech never get to where we expect it, then, price will never matter and will go to 0. If it gets widly adopted, price will go incredibly high compared to now, no matter the "manipulation".

Because it doesn't matter what banks want or need, if the people doesn't want USD and can easily use Bitcoin instead, they will. When they do, they don't need banks anymore if they work only in USD. Even if only 10% of the people only use bitcoin, bitcoin will sky rocket so high that it will probably entice others to do the same by fear of missing out. 10% of people is probably enough to collapse the usd value, since it would mean a big increase in supply and less demand. 
That's what is brilliant with bitcoin. It doesn't need USD. At that point, sound money chase away bad money because people want to spend USD but buy bitcoin.  If people are scare of spending bitcoin right until they don't have USD anymore, USD will collapse quick. Don't forget that people will get paid in BTC and spend BTC in that future. Why do they need the banks then, if they didn't adjust? Why are people buying USD and BTC in Venezuela and spend their homeland currency as soon as they can? Same reason why people will do the same with USD until it collapses. 
Again, except if they adjust and create a USD crypto that is readily tradable for other crypto with some benefits when used.. Like.. lower interests on your loan.. Or credit for your taxes..

Only thing that matters is the electricity price and the power of the mining rig. Making some %back on your money on a small scale is easier than on a big scale, because the side expense are lower (rent for your "mine", powerful AC, hiring employees, etc). Making a living out of it is of course impossible on a small scale.
Mining rigs are actually the most available they ever were in the last few years. Hype is low, now is a good time to get into it if electricity price allow it and if you believe bitcoin will go up : mine some coins, HODL. Does that generate more bitcoins for your money in 4-5 months than buying bitcoin now? If yes, potentially a good bet. If not, just buy bitcoin with that money.
AGAIN if you believe bitcoin will go up long term. If not and just want to make a quick buck out of it because you heard it was easy money... Yes, you missed the boat for that.

??? Why would you need to transfer back to fiat? 
That's the whole point. You will be able to buy, get payed and live with bitcoin. It's already happening. More and more. It's a slow process, but an exponential one. 
Why would you pay to convert fiat to BTC? Same reason people do it now. Because BTC was gaining value while Fiat was losing value. Why wouldn't you at that point when it's readily available? 
You fail to understand that BTC is easier and easier and cheaper and cheaper to use everyday. It's already cheaper than Fiat. Once it's also easier than Fiat, there will be no reason to use Fiat.
See you in 10 years, when you are converting most of your Fiat to BTC for saving and your remaining Fiat at a grocery store while everyone else is also buying their groceries with BTC, because they are done converting and spending that failing and inflating currency that is fiat.

Binance wasn't hacked. Some API (for trading bots) were compromised and Alts were sold to BTC and BTC to VIA. Binance blocked withdrawal quickly, to let people secure their account again. Everything dipped because of bots forcing trades. I'm expecting people will gradually trade back to their original holding quickly and effect will be minor. Almost no one lost funds and binance acted quick.

We will soon witness the end of BCH (both of them).
All that is happening now is probably just a big plot to make some big profit out of it all to pay back all they lost last few months. They still control a shit ton of hashrate, and, while they can't do much to manipulate BTC with it anymore, they can definitly use it to cash in on greedy cryptonerds who believe they can make quick money on that fork. 
In any case, BCH has been slowly dieing off for months. What will happen soon will probably finish it off. Good timing for Ver to empty his BCH bags too and get back on BTC, claiming he now has seen the light following the fiasco of the BCH fork, transfering a large influx of money from BCH to BTC, so that he can make some mad profit on the incoming bull market. He probably expect bakkt to start the FOMO, but I expect his own huge investment in BTC and his following "apology, I am back on BTC, I was wrong!" video to actually start the next bullrun.

With that perception, you haven't been in crypto for years or you are a complete idiot.
No one thinks bitcoin was a scam anymore. While the latest shitshow of a year didn't help with short term sentiment, no one in their right mind believe it's scam. People are more aware of what it is about. Bitcoin is now in their mind and, while most of them don't think it will go up again soon, when it does finally go up again, they will be quick to change their mind, fees won't be crazy thanks to segwit and lightning, and, more importantly, compared to last hype bubble, it will be much easier to buy bitcoin (most people forget that during the hype from 10k to 20k, it was months of waiting to be approved on exchanges.)

Fiat will die. That's an easy prediction. I'm not sure when, tho, that's impossible to predict. But it will and was always bound to. "The house" as you call it is in the best position possible to adapt to it, tho. Crypto is still priced in fiat. They have infinite fiat. They can strategically position themselves to be the big winners of that big transition and I believe they will. Or, they will fail miserably and die off and the house will be no more... Until something else take its place, like it happened so many times in the past.

Tons of people actually still yell "hold". There was a moment of grand panic at 5.8k, such an enormous and quick drop.
But now, sentiment is better than it ever was, bitcoin is back at a constant growing rythm like it was before the enormous fomo. Almost every media is bullish on it, also. Every single news seems to be positive and volume is slowly picking up each week.
If you bought in at 15k+ on the rise wanting to be rich yesterday without effort or patience, sure, you might be salty. The way a market works means that most people bought before 11k and a lot of them cashed out on the rise and during the crash, making profit. Don't see why people that profited from the last bull run wouldnt be back in soon to profit again seeing how things are going. 
Also, most hodlers are still fine and either bought months ago under 10k or bought again during the crash to up their holdings and are then fine average price wise.

Nothing is truly stable economy wise. The hope is that bitcoin become stable enough to be used as a currency daily. Until then, even with an enormous market cap, most people will burn through their dollar stash before using bitcoin even when it's obvious that it, or any other crypto, will be the future. You use your bad money before your good money. You stash the good money until you don't have any of the bad money.

People in that circlejerk of a subreddit have a hard time understanding that, while useless for most of us already familiar with crypto, it's a big deal adoption wise.

@_date: 2018-02-18 15:04:56
How is it different? In what meaningful way? More potential exposure after a bull or bear run? 
No matter what, an increase in volume will always equate in a lower volatility in the long term and I don't see how being in the spotlight can hurt adoption, ever. Also, same argument ("It's mainstream now! It's different!") has been raised every single time it had a big fall after a big rise. Truth is, maybe "bitcoin" is more known now by the mass, but it's still only bought by very few, because it's tedious as hell to get validated anywhere you can actually buy online. Until it's as easy as buying something on amazon or ebay for a newcomer, it will still not be mainstream. It will only get easier and easier to buy in tho, and every exposure wave means new people that couldnt buy last time because validation took forever until it crashed and scared them, who will be validated when the next fomo kicks in.

Won't happen until LN is running and fluid I guess, but Imagine Amazon accepting crypto? 10x in a day.
That's why it's silly to worry about daily or even weekly price movement until the liquidity is way bigger.

It's called self fulfilling prophecy : if enough people transfer to bitcoin to diversify during/after a crash because they expect others to do the same... Then, it become a safe haven from the stock market.
It's not about being safe, it's about Bitcoin reacting in a different way from the stock market.

What about buying on robinhood now, since it's easy, to "buy at the price you want to" during a dip or a huge rally.

Yes. Trivial hard fork.
We are probably talking of 10 years in the future. By that time, most alt coins will be dead. If there is consensus by the devs and most users, it will be trivial. ETC to ETH was trivial and was a hard fork.

We are discussing HODL here, basically the idea of never cashing out, using it as currency, when you feel like it is worth enough of it's potential.
Still, if you want to cash out from your hardware wallet, its not that hard. You will pay a fee to have a fast transfer on the blockchain (until lightning route everything between exchanges and hardware wallets) but it should be quick enough for you to "profit" from a spike in the price, as long as it covers more than the fees. And it will, if you have enough skin in the game to need a hardware wallet.

They can already launder it easily with crypto. They don't need to make crypto the official currencies of the country for that. That mostly help the citizens here, they are the one who will benefit from easier access to crypto, not the corrupted elite. They already have easy access.
How is the 3$ salary relevant at all? 3$ worth of crypto will likely rise or at least decrease in value slower than the official fiat. BTC fees are a problem here in that instance when they are high, I agree. It's pratically free right now. There is always LTC/ETH and eventually lightning if fees get crazy again. 3$ of crypto is shit, of course, but it's better than 3$ worth of bolivar, probably worth 2,20$ by the time you spend it even if you do it quickly.
I understand your frustration about your government, but it has nothing to do about crypto. All the problems you are talking about are related to corruption, crypto won't make it worse in any way. 
@_date: 2018-02-11 07:03:32
Except "several days" almost never happens in crypto and probably won't until price discovery is over.
Volume got lower on the downswing, was way higher the last few days on the upswing. So yes, here, volume tells us that a lot of people are not selling and might be waiting for a lower price to buy back. Volume is extremly low today, while price is on a pretty high decline. It's sign of a possible market switch 101.
@_date: 2018-02-26 14:27:34
It's not like the "halvening" suddenly reducing drastically the amount of new bitcoin mined will probably increase the price is a hard concept to grasp.
Add to that the FOMO of every media outlet talking about it weeks before it happens, for sure, probably making "bitcoin" trend everywhere...
It's obvious really that the price will skyrocket. 
Doesn't mean that bitcoin is a good buy right now. Will it skyrocket from 100k to 300k? From 200$ to 2000$? Who knows.

But, you can miss out on big selling and buying opportunities during off market hours movement. Funny thing is, the biggest opportunities are always off market hours almost, since asia is the biggest market for now.
Also, no way yet for you to diversify slightly in other crypto, to profit from more and more sellers letting you buy with bitcoin, at often a discount or to use crypto as a potential hedge against enormous market crash or even banks insolvency. 
It is convenient tho, I agree.

Are you validated on an exchange, a process that could take you weeks? Can you buy as soon as it goes down? Will you stay alert about the price even when most media outlets stop giving a shit because it's low and has low volume?
If yes, then you can maybe wait. If not, yes, I believe it is still a good time to get in. We are far from ATH and volume shows that we are far from fomo. I believe in bitcoin so I believe any entrypoint now is better than no entrypoint at all. Of course, only with money you can afford to lose if things go south.

Great showcase of a weird whale selling a ton at market price instead of with sell orders, losing value in the process but manipulating the market like crazy because of low liquidity. Potentially not intentional and just needed cash as soon as possible.

Makes no sense. You are rambling. You can't compare volumes from months ago, they heavily fluctuate with media hype and yearly quarters. Volume went through the roof because of the crash. Big movement attracts volume. Higher volume reduce volatility when it's natural volume and not reactionary volume.

Forking is easy. Doesn't mean it reduces scarcity. What is the incentive to secure and mine that new fork? Why would anyone switch to it? There is reason why forks are pretty much all centralised worthless altcoins without real nodes out of the few that are faked by the dev on some chinese servers.
A successful forks that improves everything about bitcoin would eventually replace bitcoin too, without reducing scarcity. Short of those trying to day trade it, everyone would have the same number of tokens on that new fork from the start and when the flippening happens, we would back at initial scarcity.

The fact that volume is now slowly going down while price is going up makes me feel cautious.

There was predictions of every single possibilities all around, everywhere. Of course some were right after the fact.
Thing is, you won't find any scientific evidence of TA done by experts being statistically accurate at predicting anything, on any market. What will make you a successful trader or investor is not TA, it's a flair for psychology, a deep understanding of the industry you are getting involved and, EVEN MORE SO, good bankroll strategy.
But hey, you do you, believe in your charts and lines, I will believe in Bitcoin instead, while carefully managing risk at anytime. Turned out great for me as of now.

Absolutly, you are right. For now.
Bitcoin is not a "do everything better".. At least for now. It's a "do big transactions across borders, better" with also the potential to do as good as credit card and paypal for online transactions once LN is up and running mostly everywhere. 
Now, market value wise, for the current utility, up to you to decide if it's under or over valued.
@_date: 2018-02-18 16:32:13
Also... Do you realise how many people wants to buy in, but don't simply because they are lazy and it's a huge pain right now getting validated on any exchange? And, many are waiting for validation still?
Exposure doesn't translate to immediate buy in. Not at the moment. Exposure means more potential buyers in the future. 
The biggest barrier right now is how much of an hassle it is to buy in. It's totally fine tho, network is not yet ready for mass adoption. It will be one day. At that point, I'm sure it will be so much easier to buy bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-02-20 18:00:51

You would have to open a new channel with a shop only if not a single one of your already opened channel can forward it to that shop in any number of hop.

Something that you don't understand : If the receiver doesn't convert to USD, then there is no conversion at all. It is from bitcoin wallet to bitcoin wallet. It is just a way to show price. He could program a ticker that adjust accordingly to the daily BTC value and shows only satoshi price to the costumer, sure. But it changes nothing at all.
Bitcoin is convenient, fast and cheap when you do transaction accross borders and travel a lot. It's borderless money. It has no convenience over fiat to pay small amount locally yet, of course not. That's not why it's interesting. It's interesting because it's trustless and peer to peer. 
If you don't understand the value of peer to peer, borderless, trustless money for the future and  for the contries that can't trust their government and their reserve, then sorry, no point even trying to argue with you, you are not smart enough.

Oh, I agree. I just meant that the "manipulation" is only a potential issue for day traders, not really for the hodlers or long term investors.

@_date: 2018-02-16 18:22:30
Doesn't make any real sense.
Doesn't matter if some people got in expecting to get rich quickly. Most of them probably got away during the last few weeks crash. 
Sentiment is what matter. Sentiment about bitcoin was on the low everywhere online since unconfirmed transactions were stuck over 100k, a while ago. Now, sentiment suddenly turned around last week since the last few big announcement. No reason for the whole market to come crashing down again if the sentiment is still as good. We might not get an enormous bull run in 2018, but a slow decrease from 10k? No way, not with the current sentiment. Slow increase is totally plausible, tho.
Of course a big news or a big rumor/some fud could make everything come crashing down. That's the risk of putting money in crypto. 
If you actually believe you can predict the "bubble pop" or the next "bull run" by how many comments on reddit makes you feel like they are from people expecting to get rich quickly... I am so sorry. For your own good, re-evaluate.

If 5% of people earn money while 95% starve to death because of ai and technology, without an universal income, I hope for your sake you are not part of the 5% at that point.
There would be a civil war supported by other countries who implemented a universal income. That 5% would either support wealth redistribution and universal income and those who wouldn't, would get executed pretty quickly. 
"Learn a new skill or starve" won't work. People will revolt and they would win. 
Universal income and wealth redistribution will happen everywhere eventually. Most people will have a decent living without having a job and the elite will earn more by specialising in skills that ai can't perform well or yet.

Here is my view on this : it's a fake dilemma. 
As human being, we all need to eat, drink, have fun. A lot of us even feel the need to start a family. Inflationnary currency or not doesn't change the fact that people will spend to survive and to have a good time. People won't stop spending only because their money will be worth more, later. 
We all have ways to fight inflation anyway : assets/stocks/etc. Just not our saving account anyway. And we all still spend money like crazy. Why is that? I don't go to the bar with my friends because USD will be worth 2% less next year. I go to the bar because I want to have fun. If I want my money to be worth more in the future, I can easily invest it already. Everyone can.
Sure, there is always some risk, of course, but everyone can still invest their USD in something to fight off inflation and make their money work for them. Why do we still spend it, then? My 4$ coffee could be worth 20$ in 10 years! I still spend it tho. Most of us do. It as nothing to do with inflation. 
Why would it be different with bitcoin, once price discovery phase is done and value slightly rise each year? The only difference is that saving money will be simple, instead of complicated. If I want to save money safely for later with a slight rise of value as supply is getting more and limited, I transfer my BTC to a harware wallet. If I want to take a risk and make my money work for me, I invest BTC in companies. I buy stock with them, hoping to earn more than the 1% or less gain I would get from saving it. If I want to have fun, I spend it for a video game or at the strip club, right now. 
Where is the problem in that future? Why would that not work?

@_date: 2018-02-07 04:51:15
Of course it could drop again but sentiment is really positive right now, must new comers that would panic sell had plenty of opportunities to do so already. Volume is also really good while we are on a steady rise. 
If we got another terrible bad news/some FUD, I'm sure it could drop some more. Market is rarely rational and there could be some profit taking from people that bought the 5-6k range, but when was the last time that bitcoin sentiment was that positive? More than a year ago?

Bitcoin protocol is trustless. To transact, you still need to trust the other party or the platform you are using. Same thing with cash or wire transfers tho. But, bitcoin itself, the protocol and the currency, is trustless. Impossible to print more. Impossible to change the rules (without forking), while all those are totally possible with usd. Someone can scam your bitcoin if you are not careful, but no one can change the rules of bitcoin like goverments can with the traditional currencies.

Gambling that it will be either worth a shit tons of money or nothing. 
The odds are still way better than a lottery ticket for his 18th birthday and he can just prepare a new gift if bitcoin crash to nothingness.
Of all the crypto right now, bitcoin is still the best bet for long term keep, by a lot. And I mean a whole lot. 
Of course a "new" crypto yet to be developped could replace it. No way for him to gift non existant crypto yet tho.

Buying on the rise when price break a upward resistance is a proven strategy. You need a good exit strategy and that's where people screw up, but there is nothing wrong about buying at ATH.

His argument is the dumbest. He is implying that bitcoin probably has a higher chance of making someone rich than lottery by 2020, so everyone should buy.
While true that it's a smarter buy than lottery I would agree, doesn't mean it's a smart buy. Smoking cigars is less harmful than cigarettes If you don't inhale, doesn't mean that smoking cigars is smart or healthy.
If you have an urge for gambling and bitcoin fills it, then sure, probably smarter than pachinko or video poker.

A million is actually well withing reach if it goes mainstream/is adopted.
Amazon accepting bitcoin would probably do it.
It's a big if, but it doesn't require any US dollar inflation. Just adoption. Then again, 2020 seems way too fast for that level of adoption, I agree.

Sell orders are volume too. Volume decreasing doesnt mean that the price mean, it means that it's easier to manipulate and more volatile. Lower volume means that it can shoot up like crazy with a lesser amount in the market, too.

I work all the time for it and I am not emotionnaly attached to any amount of money that won't bankrupt me.
Also means I tend to make better decisions about my money long term wise. Panicking is never good. 
People are not all the same. There is different level of risk aversion. If you are scared of losing it because you can't afford it or if you are just that kind of guy that just can't live with financial risks, don't invest your money and certainly don't gamble it on crypto.
I believe in long term prospect of bitcoin AND I only "invested" what I can afford to lose. I have zero emotions about it.
@_date: 2018-04-23 01:59:33
"No reason at all"
It's called a market, people buy and sell. Nothing else impact the price on any other market, really. So I guess no one should buy anything!
It was the biggest jump in an hour bitcoin ever had. It's extremly logical, if you understand supply and demand, considering shorts were at a all time high. A short squeeze was bound to happen eventually.

Dumping USD for BTC...?
@_date: 2019-05-15 17:38:21
That guy also forgets to mention that in that theory scenario he is portrayed, if actually LN is not enough and fees are simply too high/network is congested heavily It is still possible to hard fork WITH consensus to bigger blocks if it's the only solution we can figure out by then, it's just idiotic to do it now. 
Of course 2 years ago when segwit usage was crazy low and network was congested by spam transactions from bitmain to try to sell the narrative that Bcash is the solution, fees definitly were too high and that factored in the crash I'm sure. I don't see that happening again. Bitmain can't afford that bullshit anymore and wouldn't gain from it since they know Bcash is dead, it would just bankrupt them. Bitcoin is simply not threatened by any other altcoin right now like it was from 5k to 20k in 2017.
Natural volume is high right now, much higher than in 2017 before the big surge and when it was congested by spam, fees are low and network can take much much more still. Basically, won't be a problem until Bitcoin skyrocket again and by that point people won't care about fees because they will just be in the midst of crazy fomo, again.

No matter how low it appears to you, it is still a record for South Korea and it's not like it was 20 transactions : it was a lot of small 100$  transactions. And, again, South Korea was a big factor in the last enormous bull run. Gambling is illegal here, young people are often forced to study by their parents, and forbidden to do any part time job therefore given a way too big of an allowance. Youth have some expandable money and don't know what to do with it and are praying for a way to escape the rat race that is waiting for them in one of the shittiest job market in the world.
Now, I agree, it's hardly that big of a deal... Yet.

Every shitcoins are priced in bitcoin, even if you platform shows you USD value. When bitcoin goes up 5%, those shitcoins goes up 10%. When bitcoin goes down 5%, they go down 10%.
Why? Because they are NOT price in USD and because the volume is extremly low, therefore it's so much easier for the bots to influence the price.
Look at a yearly graph. ETH is down around 62% against bitcoin, even after that 10% rise. If you think ETH is doing well and those shitcoins in general are worth it... Go right ahead.
Can you get lucky sometime and make some quick profit by daytrading those shitcoins? Sure. You could. But it's pure gambling, because you CAN'T beat bots at this game long term. You just can't. It's stacked against you the same way gambling at a casino is.

There is not even enough circulating supply for it to be possible, it would skyrocket the price to milions per coins way before he gets there and then he wouldn't have the fund. Wouldn't matter tho because the following fomo if that happened overnight would probably kill usd in a  week.

They are definitly not when you travel outside your countries, which is the case here, if you haven't realised by reading the title I don't know what to say... 
4% waay is cheaper than cash advance from your credit card which is often the only way to withdraw money outside your country. And, moreover, even if you bring cash that you exchanged at a counter at the airport, the fee is often around 8-10%, since they normally add 8-10% to their favour from the actual real rate of exchange.
Even inside your country if it's not an ATM from your bank, which is not also that easy to find, withdrawing cash has a fixed fee. Normally around 4-10$, which is worst than 4% in a lot of situation if you don't want to carry around a ludicrous amount of cash since it's not the safest thing.
Obviously eventually those BTC ATMs fees will be even cheaper, when there is more competition. The fees of using fiat ATMs are just getting worse and worse every year tho.

It didn't crash it because no one owns it/use it. Bitmain own most of it and I am sure to an extent that is almost unbelievable. 
No, they do not own nearly enough hashrate to reorg btc. They had enough for BCH because they used what is normally used to mine BTC to reorg the extremly weak BCH. Even if they have 35x more hashrate on BTC than BCH usually, that's what they had to use to 51%. It's something you can easily calculate yourself : no, they can't do it to BTC.

Lol. You can just check most posts and comments to realise that we are past capitulation.
There is always some new buyers, just less and less. Same with any bubble, crash, capitulation and rebound. Volume is extremly low, good news have no impact and those posts are now extremly rare + filled with comments of people mocking him, while 2 or 3 months ago most comments in a post like this were mostly positive still.
"Capitulation phase" refer to the global sentiment, not to the absolute. Capitulation is when most people have gave up with it. We are past that. Price is now lower than before the big bull run of 2017. We are in for a possibly long period of slow decline and sideway movement.

Does it matter? Better that, than holding USD in that instance.
I am not necessarly wishing it will happen, I am just expecting it, therefore I'd rather hold some BTCs. If I have to help my family and close friends, so be it, better that than being in the ditch also. 
There is also the more probable outcome of a slow and gradual increase and adoption : sure some laggers will be left out cold but most will transition fine : if BTC gets to 1m it means that most people will have bought some and won't be better or worse : their purchasing power will probably be around the same.
But... We are far from there. 10 years is way too soon. 
USD will collapse one day, could be 25 years, could be 200 years... But it will.
@_date: 2019-05-07 04:33:51

I am not sure you understand how difficulty adjustment works.
There will be no crazyness or bloodbath. If the price just doesn't shoot up like crazy overnight (which, it won't) a lot of miners will become non profitable, so they will stop mining (to avoid loss) and the difficulty adjustment will do its job in under a week or so until it average to the same amount of miners we are used to, more or less.
It won't have a real impact on miners (after a few days), only on the supply, therefore yes, there is a chance that it affect the price upward. Not related to mining.

It will be a gradual process. Also, no reason to open and close every day. You could easily be fine doing it once a year. Yes, eventually, even with LN, a blocksize increase will probably be needed : it will later be done with consensus, in a safe manner and in a way that do not centralize : in 5 years, I am expecting that technology will allow to double the block size with no virtually no negative impacts. Coupled with a functionning 2nd layer like LN, then sky is the limit.
LN alone won't allow infinite grow, but allow moderate to small block size increases to be exponentially more effective, while allowing much cheaper (free?) 2nd layer transactions for daily payments.
+ it is also much more anonymous.

Right now : international transfer. Much cheaper with bitcoin. 
In the future : a currency that is much safer, cheaper, useable everywhere on earth and resistant to inflation.
I travel a lot and it's perfect, especially in Asia. Now, the volatility is annoying, sure. That's why I simply buy bitcoin in USD and spend my bitcoin right away. It's cheaper than using my credit card and paying the conversion fee or converting money at the bank.
@_date: 2019-05-16 01:03:28
Yes but no, not exactly true. There is always an imbalance. Price going up or down shows where the imbalance settles. Almost no one is "market buying" and "market selling", most of the volume is in open orders, meaning that buyers and sellers ask for a specific price higher or lower than the current price even if ever so slightly.
