How many? Good luck, my friend.

Or he just learned to accept it... like me and my friends selling at around $20 when we were in college. Without people making early transactions, BTC wouldn’t be where it is today anyway.

Yikes, was yours stolen??
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:06:43
Yup. It cracks me up when people say they wish they could go back in time and buy shit tons of Apple stock in the 90s as if that wouldn’t change things.

Yep.... it just sucks because even having 1 or 2 leftover would be very helpful right now with some stuff I have going on but who’s to say I wouldn’t have sold at $1000? I probably would have.

Not really. I didn’t suffer like a slave, nor was I forced to buy/sell BTC. If anything, I was just an early adopter who suffered typical early adopter woes.

Yeah, you can’t really get stuck on “what if I held out” because first off, you can’t do anything about it. Secondly, early transactions facilitated the growth and acceptance of BTC. There are stupid articles saying “the first pizza bought with bitcoins is worth $100M!” but that’s not the case at all because without that pizza being bought, BTC wouldn’t be worth $10k. 
It would be nice to not have to work anymore or at least have a fully paid off house though...

That’s the problem I have with it and why I think it’ll burst. Unlike Amazon &amp; their ever-increasing stock prices, BTC’s utility hasn’t increased at all whereas Amazon had grown immensely and changed the landscape of retail and cloud computing. BTC value is currently almost all speculation and it’s incredibly over-valued right now.

I would never have to work again if I sold my peak amount of BTC at $10k, but who’s to say I wouldn’t have sold at $1k even if I held out until then? Shit’s wild and the fact BTC is widely seen as an investment tool instead of a transactional utility is leading me to believe there’s going to be a burst but we’ll see.
