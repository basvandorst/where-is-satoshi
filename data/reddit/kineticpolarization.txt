Lol, I agree!
I must admit though that I don't think I know what LEAs are. I can't recall that I've ever seen that or heard it before. Although, I am fairly new (maybe just under a month) into crypto and crypto-investing.
And yeah, it sucks. This is actually kind of related to a main reason why I recently got so invested in cryptocurrencies. They seem to offer much more accessibility to the regular folks out there that have comparatively little in the way of money and resources, but have such huge ambitions and goals to help make the world a better place. Hopefully I don't come off as braggy or pretentious or anything. I just have very lofty goals in life. I don't even think I'll want to start a family ever - I just want to gain wealth to help my family at first and then start investing large amounts of money into places like my hometown and other low-income communities. So many people live in those areas that just need the *opportunity* to do great things. A country/group/team/etc. is only really as strong as it's weakest link. Not to sound too cliche lol.
But yeah, rambling again, sorry! Haha I just get more and more fed up with the current system of the world the older I get.

Ah, ok that makes sense haha. Yeah I've heard people say that, but I've just not seen it written in the form of an acronym.
But yeah, it's still all really in its infancy I think, but I get very excited about the potential outcomes of crypto and it's technology.

The auction is only open to those that are pre-registered. Part of the process of registration is a *required minimum deposit* of $200,000. While that deposit is refundable, it already excludes all who can't deposit that amount - a number of people that, I'd guess, far exceeds the number of people who can. Still, let's assume (for the sake of argument) that I actually *do* have the kind of wealth where I am able to put down this amount of money without having to sell something like my car or house, or having to use loans, or do a number of other things to get this amount of money that isn't *truly* my own. So, I will strictly work from the assumption that I have **at least** this level of disposable income. I'll work from the position of me being at the lowest end of the wealth spectrum to still have the ability to enter the auction safely. After all, a multi-billionaire would find it much easier (perhaps almost trivial) to do this than would a person with a net worth of, say, $1.2 million.
Even assuming all of this, I would still be at least a little weary of depositing such a balance to a government agency. Now idk how this particular agency operates or how differently government beaurocracy impacts the wealthy as opposed to the rest of us regular folks, but I'd be worried about my funds being stuck in limbo within some overly complicated bureaucratic process should I attempt to get that offered refund.
To your other point, the Picasso one, I'd say that's kind of fallacious reasoning. One is (albeit still very valuable) a digital currency. The other is an example of art created by one of the most famous artists in history. The two can't be compared really. But that does bring me to a big reason *why* I like and have put hope into cryptocurrencies - they offer a new way of global operation that is far less exclusive than the traditional world of finances. Where the old way is pretty much the wealthiest among us get the majority of the power while the actual majority of humanity comparatively gets the leftover scraps, a new way (possibly brought about by crypto) would be, well, *decentralized*.
So my main point was that having this minimum deposit automatically excludes the majority of people from taking part in the auction. Yet it ensures that individuals that are already financially stronger than most get even more wealth added to their hoard.

From what I've read, there is a minimum (but refundable) registration deposit of $200,000.
That's so annoying.
"You must be rich to have a shot at being richer."
I know that's "how the world works" I guess, and that it's not atypical for the US government to give money/resources to it's citizens that actually could need them, but I would do a lot (not *anything*, but a lot) for even 1 or just 0.5 BTC!
I'm a broke ass first-generation college student, double majoring in math and computer science, and I don't even make HALF the current value of a single BTC in an entire *year* working part time at my school. I could think of so many things I could do with just a couple or a hand full of BTC (let alone a few **thousand**). It could help me start paying off all my compounding student loan debt, helping out with my family's musical bills and other expenses, donate some to my school's very underfunded science department, a LOT of things I'd love to have the chance to do!
Instead, someone with at least $200k to drop (which, sure, may not be *that* wealthy to some. But, to me and my family/friends, that is MULTIPLE years of gross income and most definitely nothing to scoff at) will get so many BTC that may or may not just get put back into trading or into someone's very healthy bank account. It's frustrating as all hell...
Sorry, rant over!! ��

It's a little inconvenient, but paper wallets are just as secure as hardware wallets. I can see why people don't like them, and every kind of wallet has pros and cons, but I personally like paper.
EDIT: Also meant to mention that they are free whereas hardware wallets can be pricey from what I've seen.
