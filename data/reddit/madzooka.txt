There are pros and cons to this. If it's deemed as money, then it will be regulated as such. FINCEN already has done so. The tradeoff, now the IRS should not tax it has a property. Dam government needs to make up their mind what to call it. Or even better, just leave it alone. But we all know that won't be happening.

Well yeah, it's not exactly a Ponzi scheme per se, but it is a lot like oil and other natural resources, but they're a resource and not a currency. It is quite a lot like a natural occurring Ponzi scheme though. I don't anyone has actually explained this yet, the core point I'm getting at is if the supply is inherently built to continually diminish, then wouldn't the price continually increase, and that in itself is can't sustain a stable currency and the people who invested early will never be at risk because their asset will be guaranteed to continually appreciate in value

I don't believe Satoshi ever requested that Gavin contact the CIA.  Gavin informed Satoshi that the CIA had contacted him.  After Gavin sent him that email, Satoshi no longer responded.  The implication is that he chose that moment to bail from the project, out of concern for being identified.

Bitcoin isn't for the faint of heart that's for sure. Many of us have been through multiple swings in both directions but it seems bear hunting season is about to start so newcomers should better get out their battle axes if they hop on board. One either has a vision on what Bitcoin can become or they do not. More and more big money has gotten on board more so than ever before and you can use it in many more places than before. More exchanges are popping up and we're on the cusp of ETFs and more hedge funds arriving in the ecosystem, so more mega financial interests are showing interest. It's not like you're putting your money on a roulette wheel at the moment. Can't say I'm all in but mostly.

This is exactly the type of thing I think bitcoin needs to go to the next level. Needs to be able to be treated like a credit or debit card, then people will "get" how to simply use bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-04-21 13:09:35
I've never thought that Bitcoin mining looks so impressive!
@_date: 2014-07-21 08:02:16
I think one of the biggest problems with insuring bitcoin, is that there cant be a charge back. If money is stolen or lost, the bank wouldn't be able to reverse it and get it back.
If the same were for fiat, the insurance would go through the ceiling with how much money is just lost and gone.

Awesome. Finally.
I can't believe it's been 5 years with centralized exchanges for a decentralized currency. I hope we see a lot more decentralized exchanges very, very soon.

 There are so many things that would have to be taken into account, and I think it will be at least a year or more they figure out how to "control" coins, if its even possible.

Good to see the rise of Bitcoin network,this really helps make Bitcoin a more reliable and versatile payment solution.Have seen bitcoin birth,its growth and don't wanna see the bitcoin network ceased like that of Liberty Reserve.Such growth into physical payment option on bitcoin network for sure ensures its been used for a purpose.

I think you are still liable for paying taxes once you use the bitcoins though. bitcoin is treated as an asset by the IRS, not a currency.

I would expect a lot of people to panic if those coins were moved what do you think? I think it shows that he's moving them for a purpose and then there will be a lot of speculation that he was planning this all a long so he could profit from Bitcoin.

unfortunately they seem to be out of coins at the moment.

"So where does this leave us?  An Inaccessible Cold Storage that managed to bleed bitcoins into the ether is no doubt the worst outcome possible and could potentially explain a Transaction Malleability cover story" this is not a conclusion I wanted.

Watch some western movies first, then climb your way up int time with other old movies until you get where you know for experience.
That way you will to get some insight about prices
I remember the wage of a high paid Federal Judge in some Clint Eastwood movie was $200. And people could survive with only $20/month. Also in the 50's a coffe used to cost cents(I remember from the Edie Wood movie, if i'm not wrong)

So what's your prediction about bitcoin's price? Will it go higher ? if so - how much ?
@_date: 2014-08-25 06:53:00
1minute is just as bad as 10minutes when in a supermarket, especially as this 1minute block time sometimes will also take 20minutes. We need other solutions to that and there are off-chain solutions.
But to answer the OP question:
What? I would add proof of stake. 
Why? It's cheaper and better aligned with keeping the fees low and the network secure. With proof of stake there is no reason at all to have fees beyond keeping the blocks free of spam. Those holding bitcoins would have a huge incentive to keep the blockchain rolling even without block rewards and transaction fees. The claim that with proof of stake the rich become richer is based on the assumption that mining is a for profit venture but with mining (securing the transactions) being built back into every full client cause we can, we wouldn't have to worry about the 50%-pools and wouldn't be blamed for wasting energy on mining. Also those mining chip companies could focus on more meaningful stuff.
We could continue to give the block reward to proof of stake blocks and reserve the mining fees to proof of stake, aligned with the block reward halfing. At the next block reward halfing we don't half the block reward but we half the POW blocks, doubling the POW difficulty and adding POS.

Can anyone explain to me why does he cares about it? and by the way the headline is not correct...
@_date: 2014-08-25 07:03:28
I think a whale could easily cause massive margin calls on an exchange if they held a high enough of a percentage of the total BTC being borrowed. If they only withdrew the BTC what was being used by other traders then the traders would either need to pay more to carry their positions or would need to sell their BTC causing the price to fall and others to sell.

Bitcoin may replace credit cards, paypal, western union, bank wires, etc in the future, but not fiat money since there are still places that have unstable or no internet service or electricity.
