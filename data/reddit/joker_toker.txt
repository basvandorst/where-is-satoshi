Why make regular backups? You can really just make a backup one time (or maybe make a few at once and put them in different places). No need to update the backup, right?

Ok, this is news to me. Just to make sure I understand correctly: In the bitcoin-qt wallet there is the "receive" button with addresses you can receive coins from. So if I send 100 transactions to one of those addresses, any backups I previously made will no longer have my coins? Is there an article you could link to explaining this in more detail? Thanks for your help.

One thing you should know is that the cryptographic underpinnings of bitcoin are intrinsic to the notion of a transaction; you cannot properly understand nor explain a transaction without some mention of its cryptography. 
The best technical summary I've read on Bitcoin is ThePiachu's master's thesis, "[Design and security analysis of Bitcoin infrastructure using application deployed on Google Apps Engine]( See also his [bitcointalk.org thread]( 
You should also refer to the Transaction protocol discussed [on the wiki]( 
[This paper]( from Microsoft Research points out some misplaced incentives in bitcoin transactions and presents a solution.
By all means tip, but if you do please send it to ThePiachu. His bitcoin address is in the thread linked as well as at the top of his thesis.

It is not representative of the whole community by any means, but r/Bitcoin is an important resource that can influence the outcome. 
Spreading the word within Reddit as a larger community is actually a pretty good place to start. The tipbot does a great job of raising awareness in a constructive way, but highly upvoted articles about the latest price only screams "bubble!". We can start to change perception through meaningful discussion about Bitcoin's strengths: anonymity, security, and convenience. Promoting it as a legitimate alternative medium of exchange online - one that is knows no borders - will offer returns to early adopters and will *actually* change the world. Really.
The most difficult problem as I see it is the wealthy class (governments, corporations, and individuals). For the ultra powerful, Bitcoin is but a toy that can be squashed. I don't know how to change that.

Cryptsy is having MAJOR problems with its deposit software right now. It's actually a pretty serious issue. If you are holding coins there and try to trade for other coins, your sell balance is deducted but the coins you traded for are not credited, and there's no trade history. It has been happening for close to 24 hours now.
I don't believe BigVern is trying to screw anyone, but the system is really fucked. I've taken some serious losses during this outage, mostly because traders are losing faith in cryptsy and removing bids/transferring coins. When the deposit system is running again I fully expect a stampede to btc and a withdrawal to other exchanges.
I'd steer clear if I were you.

Probably some truth to the analysis as well as to what you say here. 


Not really. $15 is enough to make decent profit for a sufficiently large capital investment. Based on the trade volume it appears that around 19k coins were traded at or near the bottom. If we use $114 as the average price at the bottom, that's ~$2.1M changing hands. 


Agreed, this could have been much worse. But we can't say the attack was altogether unsuccessful.
Also, no statement from MtGox that this was actually a DDOS yet. If hack was something other than DDOS, the cost may not have been as high.

Why not hang on to all BTC and purchase whatever it is you need to buy? More and more merchants are accepting it. Checkout bitspend, which lets you buy anything you want online with Bitcoin. Spending your Bitcoins with merchants eliminates your tax liability and advances the Bitcoin economy.
I currently hold around 110 Bitcoins and plan to use them within the Bitcoin economy as the need arises. I do not intend to "cash out" to USD.

Update on this. Deposits and trades are working and are "MUCH faster and more efficient" (according to Cryptsy support).
@_date: 2013-04-21 20:56:20
With significant volume they can buy the bottom and turn the market around.

Maybe that's because two online wallet sites were hacked this week?


Having done many security assessments businesses small, medium and large over the past decade, I can tell you that this is not at all the case. InfoSec security measures at companies of any size are a disaster, but in particular at small companies. One would anticipate that a company in this space (financial trading activities) might be more careful than some, but the compromise of many online wallets in the past shows that online wallets have plenty of vulnerabilities.

This is a trend I've noticed.
1. Price rises dramatically overnight in the US as Asia &amp; Europe buy 
2. US day traders sell of in large quantity to reap profits in the morning
3. Prices fluctuate in between the high &amp; low throughout the day as day traders buy back some BTC
4. Repeat.

[Update from Mt Gox](
UPDATE: This again appears to be another strong DDos attack. We are working hard to overcome it and will update when possible. It's currently 2am in Japan so please forgive us if our Facebook/Twitter updates are not as quick, though the team is certainly not taking any breaks. We're very much looking forward to implementing a much stronger solution very soon and will make an announcement to that effect once it's in place.

Is it an investment? I don't treat it as such. It may gain/lose value as compared to other currencies, but I think of it as a medium of exchange. An alternative method to pay for things. The more of us that think that way the better off we all are.

APIs (Application Programming Interface) are meant for applications to interact with each other. In the case of an exchange, the API can be used to place buy or sell orders, view  balance, initiate fund transfers, etc. You don't need to acquire an API key unless you plan to use external software to interact with the exchange.

Folks, there is a lot of FUD in this thread. I have been in  for weeks. Yes, the site has problems. Should they be open while they iron out the wrinkles? No, probably not. But this guy was flaming the channel for *hours*. jackofall gave him warnings before booting him.
Also, for the record, Cryptsy is *not* stealing coins. I have had balance problems and every single time they've eventually credited my account.
The site has growing pains, but they are not scammers.
@_date: 2013-04-21 20:39:37
Trades are not being executed during the outage. This graph shows the time immediately after the market was accepting trades again.
 I think there are two explanations for the panic sells.
1) Some people, especially new users, worry about what will happen to the exchange rate following an outage. They are unsure of whether the currency is nosediving or is somehow unstable. When the exchange comes back, many of those users sell in a panic.
2) The traders who intentionally sell with hopes of picking a nice new bottom, pocketing a tidy profit.

Well it *is* currently too volatile. The deflationary nature of bitcoin in its current state will prevent it from widespread acceptance as a medium of exchange. 
But that doesn't mean it will never reach stability, and there are a number of other misleading or factually incorrect statements in the article.

I can't find anywhere to acquire Apple products for bitcoin. Could use something like Bitspend, but I don't like the idea of paying a fee to buy a product.
Edit: I did just notice that Bitspend has Amazon Prime and any products purchases with Amazon can be shipped with free 2 day shipping. So that's pretty awesome.
