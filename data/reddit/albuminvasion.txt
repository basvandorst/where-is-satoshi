Also please use a different logo for Bcash, for example the green one that is doing rounds, or the "boxed" one used on for example CoinmarketCap.
Bcash try to pass itself off as bitcoin which is such a toxic behavior for the whole crypto space, and will ruin the reputation among newbies for  bitcoin as well as bcash and the rest of the crypto industry as more and more people will get fooled into buying bcash thinking they buy bitcoin and getting ripped off by a factor 6 (currently). Particularly serious if you're gonna do atomic swaps! 
There is no need to fuel this poor practice of deliberate brand confusion by using an almost identical logo for bcash as the bitcoin logo.

As a network, there will never be one single point when it is "ready". Like the internet itself from the 1980s onward, it will grow slowly, but exponentially, going from almost useless (due to no users) to useful. Like all exponential growth, the first phase will feel like it takes fucking forever to go anywhere, then all of a sudden, boom - everyone comes onboard in seemingly no time. The network effect is literally everything here. Deployment of apps is not what will decide the outcome (although necessary).

Taking it even further, what purpose does *this specific token* serve?
For example, take the case of Ripple. I hear fools defend their buying of XRP with "but banks like Ripple, they gonna use Ripple, I want a piece of the bank action too". But banks don't buy XRP. if anything, they contact Ripple Inc, and then operate a separate blockchain based on Ripple's tech. The XRP token is just for suckers. Additionally, if you buy a stock in a startup, sure it can be overvalued and the company can turn to shit, but at least you are buying a piece of ownership of the company which may one day yield profits. Buying a Ripple token doesn't even do that. Ripple Inc will still rake in all the profits from these banks (presumably) adopting their tech. Suckers with XRP tokens get nothing.
Sure, XRP is pumping nicely so you may ride the train for a while, assuming you get off in time. But ultimately and fundamentally, *this specific token* has zero utility, and zero value, and thus will ultimately plunge.
Lots of coins and tokens are like this. Those are the worst, and they actually do match the description as tulips.
Bitcoin, and several other coins are different. Buying a piece of bitcoin gives you access to a limited and desirable resource. That limited resource has a fundamental value for anyone who wishes to transact on the bitcoin blockchain (which is and will be something people will want to do). It's the only way to do so. Sitting on a chunk of bitcoin is similar to sitting on a chunk of prime real estate. You want to open business in Manhattan? Well you better gain access to a real estate located there. Expensive. Valuable. You want to send 100 grand on the largest uncensored, fully global, open access near-instantaneous financial network that exists, without the delays, red tape and bullshit involved with SWIFT? Well you will need to grab a sizable chunk of bitcoin to do so. Find someone who is willing to sell that chunk and buy it. That's where the inherent value is.

You "get" them even if you only own 0.03 bitcoin.
However, you still need to find some dumb sucker to sell the new coins to, and most exchanges don't touch these scams with a ten foot pole. Also, if you do touch them, and don't know what you're doing, you will lose your privacy and possibly also your bitcoins.

My advice is: Don't buy shit from scammers and fraudsters, and you will have to worry less about "protection". The number of times I got into trouble from the bank because of random "oh we blocked your card for your own protection" vastly outnumber the number of times I've had use for the consumer protection side of things.

A lot of people live in countries where they don't use $, € or £.
1.3 billion Chinese use Yuan (0.15 USD), 100m Japanese use Yen (0.001 USD), 100m Russians use Ruble (0.017 USD), 1.2 billion Indians use Rupie (0.016 USD). 
Agree 0.000001 is impractical for daily use. However 0.000001 btc = 100 sats. If bitcoin *does* come to widespread daily global use, 1 btc is likely to be of the magnitude of 1 million USD. Meaning 100 sat = 1 USD (or 1 sat = 10 Yen or approx 1 rupie or 1¢). No need to solve this "problem" until it actually becomes a problem, and at that point it may not even be a problem anymore ;)

Say you have made 30 satoshis in fees, but now one of your channels is depleted due to more downstream traffic than upstream. Instead of clising/reopening for expensive on-chain fees, you spend 20 sats encouraging traffic to utilize your channel for upstream traffic. Still have net profit and no on-chain tx needed.

No, off chain scaling (properly done, ie how LN is intended) is preventing giving power back to banks. Off chain scaling means taking power from miners (which could easily be kept hostage by banks/governments) and giving it back to a decentralised peer 2 peer network, just as how satoshi's vision was.

Because the margin cost of a transaction will be virtually zero. Any service/product/commodity with a zero margin cost will see it's price go to close to zero.
FYI people run bitcoin nodes for free. People seed torrents for free every fucking day for the last 15 years.

No, your software will do it automatically for you, just like you don't need to manually find an internet route to that web server in Korea that is streaming japanese porn...

The name "bitcoin" is a bit misleading and unfortunately chosen, in a way: There are no "coins" in the sense that we think of "a" "coin" as a discrete item. No one ever deals with exact coins. You send around 0.76543219 or 0.00372831 and similar. Almost never an exact 1.00000000 bitcoin.
"Bitgold" would have been better, but at the time another thing called "bitgold" already existed. If Bitcoin had been named "Bitgold" instead, people would have more obviously understood that you can carve out an arbitrary chunk of value.
Maybe it helps thinking of "a bitcoin" as not a coin, but rather something akin to "an ounce of gold".

It is quite possible that for example Coinbase, leveraging their position and marketing resources, will market themselves to the mainstream as the  on-ramp for access to the Lightning Network, and may gobble up a significant number of first timers, just like they do with current bitcoin. Sure.
But fundamentally, anyone who joined the network using one of those well marketed hubs can very easily cut their ties and/or open another channel to any other node and then use that. It is virtually certain there will be all sorts of nodes. Big ones like Coinbase, smaller businesses, Joe Schmo who wants to a earn a few bucks, non-profit hubs for the emancipation of the starving masses, idealistic privacy hubs by say EFF and other open source advocates, your cousin Jim because he already has a bitcoin node and running a LN node is the obvious thing to do, etc.
In this environment it doesn't matter what nodes are "well connected". You are either connected, or you are not. When you hook up to the internet with an ISP, you are either on the internet or you are not. (yes there is bandwidth, but afaik LN doesn't require any expensive cables and hardware like that). With the difference that with LN, almost anyone can be an ISP. You are either hooked up to the LN or you are not. If you are, payments will be routed regardless if the routing journey begins with Coinbase or cousin Jim. 
Caveat: Just my understanding of how things might unfold. Not an LN dev, so I may be wrong on some point(s).

No, you only connect once to the NETWORK. You don't set up a channel with every store.
TBH I found the video not really very helpful, because of the large focus on "open a channel to your coffeeshop", which although one way of looking it makes everyonbe missing the point with LN:
You open a channel to *a network* (LN), in order to transact with everyone on that network. You do not (normally) connect to one other person/business in order to transact with that entity.
This video makes people miss this insight due to it spending the first 4 minutes explaining an improbable (and clunky) use case of setting up a channel with your coffeeshop, and then briefly for just 30 seconds skims over with a "oh, and there can be a routed network also, so you don't need to do what we just spent 4 minutes explaining how to do. End of video."
LN is about the network. Like the internet itself, once you are hooked up to the network, you (or your money) can go everywhere on this network.

This is what always amaze me too. People don't seem to comprehend the implications of a fully global currency (potentially reserve currency). Global in the sense that access is equal to everyone whether you live in New York, Caracas or Bangalore. And no government control it. When Americans talk about it, it sounds like whatever happens has some kind of connection to Thanksgiving discussions, or Super Bowl ads. But bitcoin doesn't give a shit. It is everywhere. America is a province of the world - a fairly big one, but a province all the same. Not until bitcoin takes over will this sink in.
The internet is global too, and that fact has revolutionized so much, but it is still nothing compared to how absolutely country agnostic bitcoin is. And it will revolutionize the world for that reason alone (on top of the other ways it will revolutionize the world).

Most other cryptos seem able to peacefully coexist with bitcoin in a reasonably healthy rivalry and in most cases each other (a few exceptions such as Dash vs Monero).

Open a channel with someone else who has a channel connected to the denying node, or someone who has a channel with someone who has a channel with someone who has a channel with someone who has a channel with the node. If that node is part of the LN, they participate in that LN and you can (and will) route multiple hops before landing at the end receiver. If the censoring node tries to censor users several hops away, they are effectively not participating in the network, and if I am not mistaken they are not even able to tell who the money initially originated from so censoring your transaction isn't (AFAIK) even possible.

You could have your employer pay you your salary to your LN account each month (or every day/hour/second, since it doesn't matter how often).
You basically would never have to bother settling on-chain. No money is "locked up" if accepting LN payments start becoming as natural for businesses as accepting VISA, because you can spend your LN money everywhere (more so than your on-chain money).

Wallets need to integrate LN, which is what is going to take time (or be replaced by fully capable LN nodes/wallets).
This is a shift as momentous as back when the internet got upgraded with the world wide web on top of older ways of using the internet. Bitcoin is at it's 1993 moment. People back then stopped using Gopher and other weird old ways of accessing information, and started using the Mosaic browser, and then all hell broke loose.

What do you mean "secure against the network"? 
You are correct that if Alice want to send 0.5 bitcoin to Bob, using Charlie and Diana as intermediaries (because Alice is connected to Charlie, and Charlie to Diana and Diana to Bob), then Charlie and Diana need to have at least 0.5 bitcoin in liquidity. But since costs are virtually zero, I (or my software client automatically) could send 5 transactions of 0.1 each if say Diana only has a liquidity of 0.1. If propagation time of these transactions is negligable, the end result will be the same: Alice will have transfered 0.5 btc to Bob, and Charlie and Diana still have the same amount as before on their nodes (possibly plus a tiny fee, although I doubt fees will be more than single digit satoshis, at most).

It is hilarious that a fedcoin would essentially take the one aspect of bitcoin that doesn't work on a massive nationwide/global scale (on-chain blockchain transactions) and keep that, and then remove all the other aspects that do work (decentralisation, pseudonymity/privacy, uncensorability, open access, limited supply). It's the ultimate failcoin.

Everyone has an interest in keeping themselves connected to the network so they can themselves use the network. 
“Locking their funds” in the network is not a meaningful description of anything since your funds can freely participate in txs of their own in the network.

Litecoin and at least a dozen other altcoins  have implemented segwit and together will form a very nice ecosystem where you can use different coins for different use cases (bitcoin will still be the most secure and most widespread, but it will be cheaper to close and open channels frequently on say Litecoin etc). The network effect will be awesome. 
Bcash's (official) raison-d'etre is that they are "bitcoin without segwit", so they will miss out on becoming part of this network. Unless they turn around and pull a copy-pasta-coin maneouver again, and implement segwit and change their narrative 180 degrees and all of a sudden segwit is the savior and not the satan.

It is perfectly possible and even likely that we'll end up in a situation where for example Litecoin still has a niche in the LN ecosystem as the cheaper alternative for lower value activity, because it would be cheaper to open and close a channel on LTC. It is still part of LN. Then, presumably, the business who received lots of LTC tx from customers may atomic swap out those LTCs for BTC and settle their daily revenue on BTC. Things like that. It's hard to predict, except that the existence of a Lightning Network where many different (compatible) cryptos can interact easily is bound to open up lots of possibilities.
Also - what if your employer finds it very conventient to pay your salary through LN, so he volunteers to open up your channel for free for you when you sign your contract with him? Lots of possibilities.

People already have their bitcoin capital "locked up" in wallets... No significant difference. You can close your channel at any time. Moving your coins from your Ledger to an exchange then selling them on the exchange, then withdrawing the fiat to your bank - *that's* what takes time. Not closing your channel first.
Also, it's not exactly "locked up" when you can more easily spend the coins in your channel than the coins in your ledger.

Non-Segwit can send to Segwit, no problem. This is just an Electrum issue.
The problem is that when Electrum implemented Segwit, they did it by implementing Bech32 addresses, which is a an upcoming standard which is hardly implemented by anyone else.
Basically Electrum jumped *two* steps ahead (to Bech32) instead of just one step ahead (to plain vanilla Segwit).
While it is awesome that Electrum is super early with support for Bech32, it is really annoying that they tried to skip implementing  vanilla Segwit addresses, because the current situation is exactly as you describe it, that you have to continue using non-segwit with Electrum, even though they have support for segwit, because their futuristic Bech32/segwit implementation cannot receive coins from virtually anyone whose wallets just respond "wut is dis? Dis no bitcoin address bro!" if you enter a Bech32 address.

I think countries like China and Russia are beginning to realize that compared to the dollar as world reserve currency, bitcoin is preferable. Sure China would love to see the Renminbi replace the USD, but they probably realize that is unlikely to happen. A geopolitically neutral world currency such as bitcoin would be far better than one controlled by their rival, the US. 
I think some kind of reasoning along these lines is behind Russia's increasinly positive stance towards crypto.

The problem is the "miners", as in the actual mining hardware, not the "miners", as in the people running the hardware. Quite confusing, I know ;)
Bitmain is the manufacturer of the hardware, and catching up with market leading hardware manufacturer is no small feat and extremely expensive. This is why the situation is so problematic. Bitcoin is designed to be somewhat resilient to concentration of mining farms and whatnot, but against centralization in hardware manufacturing, not so much.

Neither chain really dies, they just wither away into obscurity as some more government obedient coin rises from the ashes of the bitcoin civil war.
That, for example, is also pretty bad. And an outcome with a quite significant probability. If bitcoin cannot be resilient to survive even an attack from within, then why would anyone trust it to be resilient to an attack from a hostile outside force?

Your last transaction cost the network *more* than $5 to process. Only reason you got it as cheap as $5 is because of the block reward subsidy. Eventually, the block reward subsidy is going to run out and all on-chain transactions will be priced according to their true cost, even with 2 or 4 or 8 or 128 MB blocks.
At that point, 2nd layer solutions will be necessary anyway for cheap tx, so why resist them now? Not to mention all the other benefits they bring, such as shortening the 10+ minute confirmation times.

He does have a point that no one is *pricing* stuff in bitcoin (although that is irrelevant to it's usefulness, and also no one is pricing anything in gold either).

I don't see how LN would be more easily regulated than "first layer" bitcoin. The exact opposite IMHO. The easiest way for governments to take control over bitcoin would still be through controlling miners, which needs mining to be sufficiently centralized so they can put pressure on the big miners to censor transactions as requested.
Centralized mining is equally vulnerable to such pressure regardless if 1st or 2nd layer is discussed. 2nd layer has the potential to be less transparent however, and therefore safer against censorship on a massive scale.

If bitcoin forks into two chains, neither of which is universally considered The One Chain, then yes, anyone with even the slightest knowledge of market psychology will find it obvious that the price of both chains will plummet like a rock.
Eventually one might emerge the victor, but it would take many years to recover, pricewise. 
Can't believe there are people who do not see this.
If you are fine with bitcoin (both bitcoin coins) total market cap to drop to be on par with Ethereum, and don't see a problem with that, fair enough.

My point is though, that there is a time window (whether it is made up of one very slow but almost full 2016 blocks adjustment period, or one very slow shorter period (&lt;&lt;2016) plus one full (=2016) but less slow (because some downward difficulty adjustment already happened) period. That time window will be finite and on the scale of one or several months.
If classic manage to get through that period without the economic majority abandoning it, then classic is in a better position than BU.


Calling the fork "BTC" will have huge consequences if classic survives. See for example Charlie Lee's comments yesterday. There is practical/legal/economic/idelogical/trust reasons why for example exchanges will be unwilling and/or unable to *immediately* jump ship of classic chain, until it is *certain* that classic chain will lose. Even if BU performs flawlessly (which a lot of economic actors will have doubts about for some time after the fork). So immediately after fork, they will still be siding with classic, getting ready to launch BTU as altcoin. If hashrate flows completely to BTU, then they will eventually jump ship, partly because classic isn't transacting anything, partly because it is likely to die. It all becomes a judgement call about where things seem to be heading. Big companies will have a lot of inertia making them wait until they know how things are going.
And due to the nature of BU, if classic speed picks up and chain catches up and surpasses BU in chain length, then *it* would become the longer chain and if that happens, BTU chain will go down in flames and be discarded (in a way that BTC-old does not, because classic blocks are compatible with BU, but not vice versa - and this very fact, if it starts to become a significant risk to happen, will increasingly supress the market price of BTU - who would pay for transactions and coins that might end up discarded completely?). 
The bottom line is still that initially, economic actors such as exchanges and nodes, will default to support classic. Eventually they will switch, but the switch will take time. How long? More than hours. Days? weeks? months? It depends on how decisive BTU hashrate victory is.  But if that takes too long (ie until after classic difficulty fully adjusted either by completing 2016 + x blocks), then momentum will switch to classic. Once momentum starts to swing, then market price of classic coins will pump and BTU drop, which in turn will lead hash rate to flow back to classic.

LN is a network, like the Internet itself, not just fragmented 1:1 channels. Payments can route around several nodes. So you don't necessarily need a channel with your lunch buddy, you just need to both have channels to the same network, whether that common LN be "Keatonatron Lunchbuddies"  or "ACME Business Corp. Employees LN" or "Coinbase Evil Global LN". If you have a channel to B, and B to C and C to your lunch buddy, then the two of you can transact.

Nice "OMG racism!" fallacy there. It's not about "the chinese". It's about

b) It being a totalitarian country with zero respect for human rights such as privacy, liberty and pluralism.
Pretty sure most sane bitcoiners would prefer if miners were more decentralised and not from any particular country at all (whichever that is), but rather from lots of places around the world. 
And if one country were to be chosen, it surely would be better if it wasn't a country known to make sure that most of it's industries are controlled by one domestic major actor, one which is forced (more or less directly) to be loyal to the CPC.
Personally I love the Chinese. Wonderful people. China's political regime? Not quite as much. China's regime having the levers to control bitcoin? Hell no.

Uhm, no. Segwit is the one solution that actually makes bitcoin scale magnitudes rather than small linear upgrades. By enabling Lightning Network and similar 2nd layer solutions. On-chain scaling will never allow bitcoin to be anything other than a tiny fringe phenomenon.

Look, you have one open source project with hundreds of highly experienced contributors, one that has been going for for years. Anyone can suggest changes and contribute to the project. It is open source how open source works. This is Core.
Then on the other hand you have a handful of people who decided they wanted something different and went about doing that. While most of their project is based on code developed by Core over the years, they add and modify and end up with their own BU project. Their project is not fully open and for example code changes are quickly added and included without the due process that invites extensive code review. This is understandable, I guess, as the BU guys want to keep "their" project "theirs", but it means peer review is bypassed, and bugs such as these are the result. It doesn't exactly help that the BU guys are blatantly far less experienced and knowledgeable than the vast group of people contributing to the open source Core project.
So now you expect the hundreds of contributors to the open source project to drop the projects they are each working on in their main project and instead start pampering the kids on BU, tutoring them on code review etc, the same BU kids who do not want to be part of the open source project Core, and who want to displace the consensus emerged from the Core projects over the years and saying "Hey! Forget Core, those old duffers! This is how we should do things from now on!".

1 year? This battle will not take one year. 
BTU's one and only advantage is if it gets superior hashing power. BTU has from the fork moment, until the first difficulty adjustment on the old chain to defeat the original chain. Once difficulty has adjusted for old chain, then the hash rate advantage for BU disappears and BTC classic's superior support among other groups than miners will allow it to cruise to superiority in market cap, and once classic-chain is at price parity with BTU, then economic incentives will drive miners to support Classic, even if they didn't before . 
If BU can obtain *vastly* superior hashrate, then it will take a long time for classic's difficulty to adjust, giving BU time enough to be the only functional chain (because classic would have extremely limited tx throughput before difficulty adjustment), which could convince the economic majority to grudgingly accept it. But in either of these scenarios, the battle would be over within a couple of months, at most.
BU odds look pretty bad. If classic can obtain enough hash rate to limp along to difficulty adjustment in a not too distant time, then classic should win. BU will just have to hope for a swift victory by massive hashrate supremacy; all other scenarios and especially a contracted struggle, means defeat for BU.

Agree with this. Some people's brilliance lie in their ability for synthesis and seeing the bigger picture. This is the Steve Jobs type. You need both the expert/the "nerd" and you also need the one who can put all the pieces together in a unique manner. This isn't anti-intellectualism, it is recognition that there are several different types of skills/personalities and to succeed you need all of them.
Anti-intellectualism is when you dismiss the opinions of the experts just because they are experts and/or you just don't understand them and/or don't *want* to understand them because what they are saying is bad news. That is not what the brilliant synthesist does; he does the opposite - listens to the experts and put the pieces together.

Yet, it is how people have been using fiat for most of the last 50 years or so: You put some of your money away for safekeeping on a bank account, and keep a smaller sum readily at hand, as cash or similar. Way back people kept one stash of money as silver or whatever hidden safely at home, and put some money in their wallet. Since banks were introcued, you started putting the stash there instead. Lately we've been using the same  principle with saving or time-locked accounts or fund etc for our long term stash, and use a debit card (or, in the case mainly of Americans, a sucker credit card) tied to a checking account for our daily needs.
This two tiered system goes way back. One stash, and one spending purse.
However, for bitcoin, with 2nd layer still being in development and testing phase, and awaiting Segwit, the "stash layer" is fully usable but the "spending purse" isn't really all that convenient yet. So most of us bitcoiners are for the most part forced to use fiat surrogates for the "spending layer" (cash or bitcoin debit cards etc, or if you still get your salary in fiat, simply use fiat without gong through bitcoin). 
Bottom line is, we need that 2nd layer up and running as soon as possible. Until then, bitcoin will *mostly* be used as the "stash" layer, the savings account, the retirement fund. Cash is still superior to bitcoin as far as convenience goes, for buying beer.

I think part of the problem is actually the word "core". People from  rbtc have been so indoctrinated to think of "Core" as a group of 8 developers who also happen to be Blockstream affiliated. This is natural given the meaning of the word "Core" in English.
People hear the word "Core" and think "small group of a handful of people who controls everything else". When Ver pushes the propaganda that "Blockstream = Core = Evil little cabal that controls everything", it seems to make sense.
Even though this is not (I presume) what "Bitcoin Core" (as the name of the core implementation) is mean to mean. Kind of would have been less confusing if the client was still called Bitcoin Qt or something. When you say "But Bitcoin Core is EVERYONE, all hundreds of people volunteering to develop it!", it rings weird and "Core is an evil cabal of a handful of people" makes much more sense, linguistically.

People answering here seems to not understand where your question is coming from. To me you seem to be under the assumption that "Blocks are completed and published as soon as someone has been able to process all the transactions in them", perhaps thinking that the time it takes between two blocks is the time it takes to verify all the transactions? Well, that is not how it works. Most of the processing time for a block is spent *not* processing the actual transactions, but to "solve the math problem". This math problem only exist because it is *desired* that it should be complex and time consuming to solve a block, and it *should* take a certain amount of time (in bitcoin's case, 10 minutes; another coin, such as Litecoin, could chose a different average block time). It being complex and time consuming to solve a block is what forces a presumptive attacker to invest insane resources into taking over the network.
If you just lower the block limit, it would not make the network spit out new blocks faster. 
Unless, of course, if you at the same time chose to speed up block time, but that would lower the security of the network. Also, the problem with bigger blocks is the total amount of data transfer required to for *miners* to get the latest block fast enough, so they can start on the next one without being at disadvantage to the other miners (and that means that you'd benefit even more from having a huge mining center in China, where everyone else is, while someone trying to mine in Africa would be at even more disadvantage than they are alread)y, *and also* the problem is for nodes (people running the Bitcoin Core client or whatever client they run) to deal with their monthly data volume. Making  blocks 1/5 the size spit out 5 times faster is equally bad (or good) as spitting out 1 MB blocks every 10 minutes since the total is the same.

This is a common way for arrogant people who don't want to admit their ignorance deal with it. "No one knows...", just because they don't know it themselves. They can't say "I don't know, but I'm sure someone else do, and you probably should have invited them to this interview, but well, here I am, heh...".
People like Trump does this all the time. "Who knew health care could be so complicated". Claiming no one knows is basically their only way to admit they don't know. For these people is only okay to not know if no one knows. If someone says they know, they must be lying. This way you have to dismiss experts and scientists, otherwise someone would be able to suggest "hey, maybe you should check with people who spent their entire life studying this? Maybe they could give you some advice?", and you'd be stuck having to discard your comfortable, and often carefully curated, prejudice. In the case of politicians, grandstanding presidents, bankers and media pundits, that could get very uncomfortable.

Each Bitcoin transaction cost $5-10 for the miners at current price/hashrate. They are subsidised with the block reward so that you only have to pay a measly 50 cent or so. The block reward ALWAYS was intended to be temporary until fee market gets off the ground. Always was. Hence the halvenings. 
Low fees (cents rather than dollars) are unsustainable for a secure blockchain. This fact is reality, not some conspiracy by an evil corp.

Only way for Segwit to activate is if BU forks away Jihans hashrate, leaving BTC open to activate SW. 
Then again team Jihan probably would keep 6% hashrate o BTC to block activation, just to ensure bitcoin has no chance to let Segwit become a success on either fork.

It means someone will create a copypasta coin and tell you "hey copypasta bitcoin is better than vanilla bitcoin, have some, then use this instead of that old crap!". But copypasta coin will give you stomach bug and copypasta coin itself will get cancer and die because it was created by noobs who could only manage to copypasta the real deal and even then they managed to screw up. Meanwhile, after a year or so, people will have returned back to the real deal bitcoin and everything will be all good.

LOL no, you are not doubling your money. Each of the coins would be worth much less. Even in a best case scenario, you'd get instead of one coin worth 1250, one coin worth say 1000 and one worth 250 (or whatever combo). But since a lot of people would sell beforehand as the fork approaches just to stay out of the clusterfuck fork, you'd probably have like one coin worth say 50 plus one worth 200 instead of one worth 1250. (Exact actual price drop obviously impossible to estimate, except that there *would* be a significant drop).

 &gt;&gt;   superior hashing power.


*Sustaining* superior hashing power is the only thing that matters to BU. This is not the same as initially obtaining superiority. if economic reasons start to favor classic chain and it's length manage to catch up, or even just *come close* to catching up, then BU is at risk of being annihilated. And that risk alone will put a hamper on BTU price. (Even disregarding other reasons favoring classic coins).


Most miners aren't going to be "BU" miners, as in "politically motivated fanatics favoring BU". Aside from Jihan's minions, most miners will be agnostic and favor whatever chain is most profitable to mine. Yes, "Jihan's minions", could switch to mining BTC, but in so doing they are either commiting so much hash power that they risk weakening the hash rate of BU, or they are only commiting a smaller amount, in which it just strengthens the BTC chain.
Short term, what matters is current hashing power, yes. However, long term, what *decides* hashing power is economic incentives, and that depends on what the economic majority, other constituents support.
Short term, Jihan can have his minions make a political commitment one way or another, which makes non-political miners see economic incentives in following. However, long term, economic incentives will trump "political mining". Ultimately, market evaluations decides.

The early 30s were a massive global clusterfuck and no one really knew what the hell to do about the world. Fascists trying their thing, communists trying something else, everyone were like "I got this crazy idea, maybe it will work - hey guys, I'll try this stupid shit on my country m'kay?". FDR tried some of the things others had tried and some of them may have had a positive impact, others not, and in the end shit got worse but then eventually the world came around and we got a couple of good decades until it was time for the next global clusterfuck in the 1970s, although that one wasn't quite as bad.
Now we're having one of those decades again (they seem to happen every 40 years or so), and again, like the 30s, everyone is madly firing shotguns into the dark, hoping some of it will hit the bad guys that surely must be out there. Like the 30s, things will probably get worse. After that, hopefully they will eventually work out fine, although you can't be sure really.

I think this is a serious danger for miners, and they know it exists. There is enough slow-burning anger at the miners in the community already that a change in PoW has some support, but so far  not enough to actually go about doing it, as no one wants to rip out Bitcoin's reputation and the security that comes with having by far the most trustworthy mining/hasrate. No one would want to rock the boat.
Should all of a sudden the boat start rocking anyway because of mining oscillation mayhem, then this question would  open up for real and people would start talking about  going ahead with changing the PoW, previously something unthinkable unless an ongoing 51% attack or some such extreme scenario.
But hashrate instability would essentially *be* such a scenario and although the change might be triggered by a need to stabilize the hashrate, once the genie is out of the bottle, algorithm might be up for discussion as well, since no one likes how Bitmain's ASICs  controls bitcoin in a monopoly like way. It just hasn't been worth the chaos of fighting that nuclear war, so far.
Hopefully Jihan and his associates realize this.

A blockchain (as an aside: using the word "blockchain" without an article "a" or "the" makes you sound like a timetravelling fintech conference attendee from 2014) is a component in the system and solution called bitcoin.  The system as a whole is a competitor to Visa and banks. The component "a blockchain" is not. It's as absurd as saying a harddrive or a microprocessor is a competitor to the newspaper. The e-Book or an iPad or the internet or the web is a competitor to a printed newspaper. A harddrive is not, a CPU is not. The new system is a competitor to an older system. A component is just a component. Only when utilized in the system (bitcoin) is the component (blockchain) meaningful.
Bitcoin is a competitor to banks and Visa, a competitor to older payments systems as well as older value storage systems. Bitcoin utilizes a blockchain as a component in the system that makes up this competitor. There are other competitors as well, including ones that also use a blockchain as part of their system (such as Ethereum or Litecoin).
So far, bitcoin is the most successful and possibly most promising system utilizing a blockchain (as well as other components) to create a challenge (if still somewhat limited in terms of volume) to banks and legacy payment systems. What the eventual outcome of this challenge will be is a different matter.

if there is widespread user support for the legacy chain, then even if 90% miners choose S2X chain, there will be much more incentive for the remaining 10% to continue mining the legacy chain, which is likely to have more than 10% of the value of the S2X chain (if significant portions of the users support it). Getting to the first difficulty adjustment would be a hurdle, but once difficulty has been adjusted, the incentives will be to mine the chain that users demand, *especially* if 90% mining power has already left.

How are "regular Bitcoin people" going to act against this "monopoly" you mean? The problem that they are a monopoly is that Russia has a shit government that doesn't allow its people to trade like the free world, which would give you several more options. What are we non-Russians going to do about your government being a fascist shit government, you mean? We didn't elect Putin and his robber stooges, your people did.  
If your government didn't be such a bunch of robbers, you would have more options and the margins on LBC wouldn't be so high. 
Again, this is how free market works. If there is not enough competetion, margins will be high. If your government bans and puts up red tape and perhaps add the need for bribes on top of that, there is not going to be a free market, and thus you have the situation on Russia bitcoins market.
Until you get rid of your little Dictator and his stooges, be happy that there is at least LocalBitcoins providing you an outlet into the free world, even though your government is trying to stop you from that.
Sorry to be so harsh, but blaming your country's shit situation on the outside world in general, and LocalBitcoin in particular, is simply ridiculous, when the problem is that your countrymen allowed Putin to run away with the country away from a democratic development and a free society that *could* have happened.

BitcoinCash, being as sloppy as they are, first declared that the ticker their coin should be referred to was to be BCC without first checking if this ticker was already taken by some other coin. Bittrex may have then said "Oh okay, BCC it is then" and added it.

Faster transactions? No. Cheaper transactions perhaps, but not faster. Average time between blocks is still 10 minutes. When the network is congested, you need to pay high fees to get into the a 10 minute block. But BTC is implementing Segwit, which increases capacity too. Of course, BTC is more likely to eventually end up congested, even with Segwit - because people are going to actually be using it... :)
(Currently transactions are much slower than 10 minutes on BCH which as I understand it will be adjusted down to normal 10 minutes with a week or whatever).
You are completely right that adoption with retailers and others is going to be just as tricky for BCH as it has always been for other bitcoin clones - Litecoin and all the other hundreds of altcoins.


Not sure what you mean here. BTC is the one that is fixing inherent problems such as transaction malleability, by implementing Segwit. BCH on the other hand, is choosing to not upgrade with Segwit. The one main change they are making is to just raise the blocksize limit.

The problem is exchanges (incompetent/sloppy ones) and coinmixers and penny casinos and other poorly written services that *will* spam the blockchain with excessive transactions if there is no fee pressure to force services to be economical with the "block resource". This is a textbook Tragedy of the Commons problem. By far the best way to deal with a Tragedy of the Commons problem is to price the commons so as to force actors to treat the resource in a way that best preserve it for everyone.

Yeah. But mining and trading on exchanges (and hodling) is all you can do with it in China afaik.
Admittedly not that different from how most people use it in the West, but we (people in the West) *can* also do other things with bitcoin, and the reason it is valuable is because we know that we *could* do those other things (and much more in the future).

The problem is that the people who agreed to it were just a bunch of guys representing a lot of money but no end users and almost none of the developers. So it wasn't an agreement except between a portion of the ecosystem, and all the people who were left out of the agreement with their perspectives being ignored were then just told "tough luck, sucks you weren't invited, but this is how it's gonna play out, so just do as we tell you. Now go implement these changes that we want that you don't want".
Needless to say such an "agreement" is likely to create more problems than it solves.
Also, most people eventually want the 2x part, when the time is right and in a sensible manner, but not the reckless and autocratic - coup-like - way this NYA debacle has been done and the shit way their client is being created and forced down the throst of everyone. So it actually got us into a worse mess than we had before. But now the NYA cartel seem to want to double down on their mess and prestige is getting in the way common sense, so we'll have another civil war because these fools can't admit that the NYA cartel was a horrible idea.

The key thing here is that the data volume difference between downloading and uploading typically differs by several orders of magnitute. Downloaded data is huge. Submitting a single transaction is a really tiny amount of data (and typically less time critical), so the idea is that you can use any low bandwidth network (including sms, carrier pigeon, or use a satellite uplink that only charges you per byte) to submit data when it is needed, while the downloading can happen from the satellites.

It's a very weird title (except it is probably good clickbait), because the video is clearly not about death of currency either, in fact Andreas says clearly states that he see a future with fiat coexisting with bitcoin and other non-state currencies (or money), more of a "in the future everything will coexist" approach, which I think is a great and realistic way of viewing it, and also makes bitcoiners seem less bonkers than when they predict that all banks and fiat currencies will become extinct, possibly within a decade or some such insanity.

Bitcoin is many things. One of the things is that it is a competitor to the entire banking industry (including Visa and mastercard) in terms of payments and value storage. Therefore bitcoin's intrinsic value is proportional to whatever piece of the global banking profits it could realistically carve out. How exactly to turn that value into a hard number, I know nothing about, but surely it's ridiculous to say that bitcoin doesn't have an intrinsic value just because your models for calculating intrinsic value is too flawed to model bitcoin's intrinsic value.
If it has utility, it has value.
"I don't know what bitcoin's intrinsic value is because my modelling is from the last century, and until I know what the value is, I ain't touching that shit" would be perfectly valid to say.
"I don't know how to calculate the value, so it doesn't have a value" is retarded.

It is not an elitist mindset to say that people need to understand the very barebones basics of bitcoin before they are ready to sink their money into it, or to admit that bitcoin is not simple enough for everyone yet. We need to educate people of these fundamentals, and we need to focus on making wallets and UI and possibly a 2nd layer ("the www of bitcoin") that is more grandma-proof than what bitcoin currently is.
It would not have been "elitist" to say in 1991,  that using gopher to look for information on the Internet was not realistic for everyone. Renaming gopher to something cooler and more easy to pronounce would not have helped. What was needed was a whole different approach to searching for information, which turned out to be the www, and subsequently stuff like Google. Endlessly year after year discussing the denomination nomenclature of bitcoin is a distraction, doesn't solve anything just patches over the fact that certain things you need to understand about bitcoin aren't digested in 10 seconds (which "hey, bitcoin is divisible to the 8th decimal" actually is).

No, that is not what I said. Cause and effect of 1930s depression is far from clear. Was the depression caused by deflation? Or was there deflation because of the depression? I would certainly lean towards the latter.
The depression was - like the 1970s and post-2007 crisis - primarily caused by structural shifts on a much grander scale, related to the cycles of the ever ongoing industrial revolution. There were undoubtedly mistakes made at all of these crises, and monetary policy may have contributed somewhat in either direction, but I would absolutely say that deflation is *not* what caused the depression. More like it was an effect of it.
The 1970s is also interesting in this context because at the time, everyone was religiously following Keynesian dogma, and assumed if they could just ramp up inflation, the ongoing downturn would just be fixed. And the result was stagflation, recession AND heavy inflation at the same time. This should not have been possible, and had experts scratch their heads until it got even worse in the Greenspan era when you had both rapid growth and zero inflation at the same time. 
Either way, the keynesian rulebook should be gone by now as it clearly doesn't work. And yet, pumping money into the economy *feels so good*, so it stays.

No, you don't have to pick. There is one bitcoin. It is the one called "bitcoin". In addition, a new altcoin called Bcash or BitcoinCash (BCH) was created. New altcoins are created almost every week. The only difference with this new altcoin and the other altcoins is that all current holders of bitcoin were given an ability to claim some of the new coin based on how many bitcoin they owned. 
You can claim those altcoin coins (BCH) if you want (and if you kept your bitcoins in a wallet/exchange that allow you to claim the BCH airdrop). They have some value currently. Or you can just ignore it and carry on as before. As you can see bitcoin carries on exactly as before, and is even (currently) slightly more valuable than last week. 
Nothing has changed with bitcoin. You can safely continue buying bitcoin a little every week.

Often the machine offers you to either scan an existing QR code you brought with you (typically in you phone wallet app), or to print a new paper wallet for you on the spot, which you can then scan. The later option is useful if scanning does not work as intended for whatever reason, and if you get a paper wallet, you obviously need to be able to swipe it to your preferred wallet when you get home (don't store coins on a paper wallet you don't know is secure).
Not all ATMs have both options, but good ones do.
Typically the procedure is:
* "Yes I want to buy!"
* "What is your phone number?" (not all ATMs force this, but I think most do nowadays).
* Wait for phone confirmation to come in SMS
* Type in phone code
* Scan your QR code or print a wallet (then scan the code of that wallet).
* Insert money
* Click done. Done! You probably will get a receipt for the transaction then.

* You have some cash at hand in your wallet, or on a credit card/checking account. The bitcoin version is this is: Keep some amount of bitcoin in a phone wallet. No big sums, just enough for regular use. If you lose it, it should be a nuisance, not a disaster.
* Then you have a savings account. Money you don't plan on using anytime soon, but could access if shit hits the fan. You may be saving up for something, or just your buffer money. Bitcoin version: You store it in some sort of cold storage. Maybe a paper wallet, maybe a hardware wallet.
* If you have a shit ton of money, you may invest it in retirement funds and other long term savings/investments solution. Bitcoin version would be some sort of more elaborate cold storage set up, probably multisig etc.

If you want to take bigger risks (if bitcoin isn't wacky enough already for you... :) you can later spice things up with one or some of the altcoins (BitcoinCash/Bcash/BCH or one of the others) - preferably AFTER you have done some due diligence of reading up properly on what the other coin does and is (this last part is sadly ignored by many who just hear a rumour that coin X just went up 1000% last week and will "probably" go up another trillion % next week).

Fair enough. The real argument is that onchain scaling is never going to be enough for wide mainstream adoption. 0.7 MB increase as you call inadequate is only marginally more inadequate than say 8 MB increase or whatever. Onchain scaling is just not ever going to be enough, unless you throw all notions of a "decentralized currency" out of the window and go for GB increases, but then, why not just use PayPal, Visa and SWIFT networks? Reinventing the centralized wheel is hardly meaningful.
So what to do? It boggles my mind that people like Ver doesn't see that the only answer is 2nd layer scaling, such as LN. Which *needs* the kind of improvements to malleability etc that SegWit provides, but which a "dumb" increase to say 2MB or 8MB does not. Yes, a modest block size increase will eventually be needed to accommodate 2nd layer scaling, but that's secondary. All efforts of anyone interested in bitcoin gaining global mainstream adoption should go to the only kind of scaling that can accomplish global mainstream adoption (or for bitcoin to become digital cash): Enabling LN and similar 2nd layer solutions. Every minute these solutions are delayed by shortsighted obstruction by Ver and others is a minute wasted of first mover advantage. Precisely the kind of delay he *claims* he is concerned about.

Fees can be a bit outrageous in the ATMs though, due to lack of competition, lack of volume and excessive regulatory burdens in most jurisdictions.

Not sure if trolling, but:  electricity is being produced at a cost. The government picks up that bill for subsidising electricity for the voters, so they think "Hey that nice mister Chavez  gives me stuff for free, I'll vote for him again" and they will keep voting them into power again and again. Of course, this scheme can't work forever because eventually selling electricity at less than the cost of producing it is going to make the government broke, which is why the next step is "maybe elections isn't really that necessary? Everyone already voted for us in the past, isn't that enough?".
Spending government money on mining bitcoin doesn't make sense if it still has to pay the production costs, and even more so since the amount of bitcoins they can make is negligable compared to how much they're running the country as a whole at a loss many magnitudes larger.

Good points, and an apt analogy with mass media. "Anyone can publish and access information and have their say" was indeed the most prominent selling points in the days of the very beginning of the web. It was never about e-commerce or any of those things in the very beginning. It was about decentralization of information flow (usually with rose-tinted googles missing that it would *also* become decentralization of *misinformation*). Just like bitcoin from the very beginning has been about decentralization of money.
Keep in mind though, that it took 25 years from the inception of the www until the walls came tumbling down in full. Global banking system can probably hang unto their position for decades, at least the first of which seemingly unharmed.

Because the miners were hoping to be able to use their no to Segwit as a bargaining chip in an agreement that gave them some other tasy things. No one - miner or not - with half a brain would have said no to Segwit on purely technical (non egoistic) grounds. 
Segwit was blocked by the mining cartel because they wanted to use it as leverage in an agreement.
The problem then is that they thought this was a legitimate way of doing things. Cause trouble and block things (others have been doing it too) to use as bargaining chips, and then the big guys get together and come to an agreement. 
The problem is the idea that Big Guys Get Together And Negotiate Their Bargaining Chips. This is not how governance in bitcoin should work. Bitcoin was specifically created to avoid this system that has already failed by giving us a world of politicians and bankers.  Bitcoin need to be controlled by math, rules, tech and end users running nodes.
Only if power mongers get rid of the idea that they can throw their fat arses around until they get their will through at the negotiating table among a select group of bigwigs, only then can bitcoin fulfill the promise of being decentralized and uncensored peer-to-peer cash. Otherwise you will have politicians and bankers running the thing once more.

You are heavily overestimating the government. I remember back in the days of the Soviet Union, when it was the most insanenly powerful and frightening entity on Earth. At any given time, they were perceived to have full and complete ability to do whatever they wanted within the Eastern block, and a lot of reach outside of it. The notion that *that* government would ever let itself collapse, be dissolved and dismantled, especially not by a fringe drunk like Yeltsin, was entirely unthinkable. 
Until it happened.
The notion that the powers that be would allow someone like Trump become POTUS was unthinkable 18 months ago.
I could go on and on back and forth through history. The ruling class have always seemed unassailable. The status quo always seems inevitable and perpetual. Until suddenly it turns out that the ruling class is mostly made up of the same kind of largely incompetent, selfish and idiotic fools as the rest of us.

There are two types of businessmen in this world.
The entrepreneurs who actually come up with a follow through with new ideas, usually upsetting the established order.
Then there are the ones who make money by leveraging their existing money and connections within the elite, making clever deals with their golf buddies among politicians and bankers. Those in real estate are more or less forced to be of this variety, due to the nature of that.
Trump is 100% the latter, 0% the former. His experience in business is about the importance of brushing up to the bankers and politicians and big corporate execs who hold the big levers, often bigger levers than his own. His experience in new technology and smallish startups is zero. He cannot even use a computer (I know, neither does Hillary, but that doesn't excuse Trump).

I have some LTC and VTC for this reason, but I am not sure how atomic swaps is going to affect relative pricing between the various coins. It could make Segwit alts more valuable, sure, but you could also get the reverse effect that there is no reason to actually *hodl* those other coins - you can just hold bitcoin as a value storage and instantly swap into the altcoin to do whatever transaction you want to do through that chain, and then the receiver will also instantly swap back to bitcoin where he stores his value. I think this could end up going either way, if the scenario with segwit alts being used for specific types of transaction, while bitcoin is the slower moving chain for big value and big and secure transactions. Or Lightning ends up being so good all by itself there will be no need for altcoins at all.
Time will tell, but it is quite exciting either way to see how all this turns out. (Which is why I don't really care that much if my alts go up or down, it's just interesting to have a stake in several different  scenarios).

Having more than one currency at the same time and being able to deal with both, is actually the normal for monetized humans. Silver and gold and copper used to be like that for most of history. In Soviet Russia people dealt with Soviet rubels and USD. People do that now in Venezuela, I think. In medieval Europe, people dealt with coins from bordering city states or fiefdoms, no big deal. 
People will be using their local government mandated fiat currency, plus bitcoin - perhaps plus some other currency as well, crypto or other. It will be perfectly fine. 
But yes, currently bitcoin isn't really functioning as a currency except in tiny niche markets (like hosting for mining or such where you are priced in bitcoin primarily) when it comes to pricing things. That's because if I want to sell you a dinner at my restaurant, I can't price that dinner in bitcoin because all my costs are probably priced in fiat. The economy need to grow *way* way bigger before that happens.

B$80/BTC by next year sounds totally legit. It would give a market cap of around 1000 Trillion USD, or to put it differently: Every asset owned by mankind, and then some, would have been exchanged for bitcoin. Every transaction, heck every conversation, would have to happen on the blockchain.
The mempool alone would probably fill a stack of RAM-memory that if lined up would stretch to the moon and back three times. Same with Roger Ver's ego.
@_date: 2016-12-24 11:08:07
$1b/BTC (=approx 21000 trillion dollars) in today's value would mean that today's *total* global value of mankind's assets has multiplied orders of magnitude. Basic napkin maths should indicate that the total value of all assets in the world is unlikely to be over a few thousand trillions. If you consider that the world GDP in on the magnitude of 100 trillion per year. Given that this "GDP" ("Global" rather than "domestic" obv) is the result of exponential growth, and the accumulated value is subject to decay and depreciation, total accumulated value of mankind's assets is unlikely to be more than a 100 years worth of global GDP, ie about 10,000 Trillions. That's probably a very high estimate. Another way to get a similar perspective is to consider that the USD money supply (M2) is on the magnitude of merely 10 trillion.
That means, the only way BTC could resonably reach $1b a piece is if the world has experienced the exact opposite of a societal collapse - either a huge rapid "singularity-like" growth leap, or a sustained stable strong growth over a long period of time, and all that sustained growth then to have seen a similtanous take-over of the financial system by bitcoin.
Which could happen, granted. ;)
Just not societal collapse *and* $1b BTC. Probably not even societal collapse and $1m BTC.

This is how market behaves. People who believe Technical Analysis is the answer to everything are crazy, but so are people who expect markets to only react in a slow a logical pace according to fundamentals. Markets usually moves in leaps and bounds. Whether those leaps and bounds can be predicted or not is up for debate, but for sure a large amount of leaps and bounds in between periods of quiet is to be always expected. There need not be a major change in fundamentals to explain a sudden movement (not a major change at the time of movement - it could have been building up for years).

Money wasn't generally a tool for survival in pre-industrial societies. It was something that could give you that "something extra" or "something fancy", but in pre-industrial society, most people didn't have time to think about money (fancy stuff) as they were too busy making a living, an activity that did *not* involve working for money, but rather tending the farm, hunting &amp; gathering, and similar activities. "Wealth" meant belonging to a family that had good lands for those activities. And you didn't generally buy land either, you inherited it, or inherited the rights to use it.

The market is rational, in that traders will seek the best way to make a profit, weighing in things like the risk that someone else triggers the collapse and you lose money from your long bets. This behavior is rational for the traders, although the aggregate effect on the bitcoin price may not seem rational, short term.

The implication of the P2P part is that it completely disintermediates the banks. To someone so used to thinking of the world financial system as being all about how to best prop up the banks so the system does not collapse, I guess it is understandable to have a blind spot for a solution that (in principle) completely eliminates the banks from the equation. For someone who has spent a life getting used to accolades, fawning audiences and admiring interviewers, it is understandable that he feels confident that he has no blind spot.

I wouldn't count on a significant higher demand directly from this any time soon, certainly not enough to affect the price. However, it is an excellent opportunity for bitcoin to convince other businesses in Switzerland to start adopting and accepting bitcoin on the news. If bitcoiners in Switzerland manage to take this opportunity, the country could eventually become a place where a healthy ecosystem gets a serious foothold. If successful, other countries could follow. That's what the benefit of this is, not a few newsflashes and beeps on the market rate.

Chinese miners invest in mining as a way of getting hold of fresh coins they can hodl, not to "make a return" in fiat terms. Plenty of much better ways of doing that in China - as you say "margins are tight", which is just another way of saying that short term profit isn't why you do it, you do it for other reasons. Those reasons being, especially in China, to transfer fiat to bitcoin with a high level of privacy.

Unless you're simply referring to that CNYBTC and USDBTC are the biggest currency pairs, which would be highly misleading in this context since that is just a reflection of these two (especially USD) currencies being the most used, or that these two economies are the largest in terms of GDP, which really says nothing specific about actual owners of the BTC.

There may (or may not - many tribal societies appear to have not, while others do) have always been the odd tribal warfare. But since the dawn of "civilization", most wars have been tax funded one way or another, from Rome to Ancient China, from the Crusades to the Tudors and so on. Indeed, being able to fund war has historically been quite openly the explicit purpose of tax. It is only very recently tax have been claimed to be used for other purposes such as welfare (although I guess fancy palaces for the royal families have sometimes also been a common purpose for tax collection, but usually under the pretense of "so we can keep a great military for your safety").

Japanese Yen was deflationary for almost 20 years (only recently managed to crawl over into inflation territory). Although economy wasn't thriving by any means, I am pretty sure people in Japan was still buying stuff with their Yen.
This myth that if there is deflation no one will invest or consume is just something Keynesian economists have been clinging to without hardly any empirical evidence other than "There was deflation in the 1930s depression, also people weren't spending, ergo deflation causes economy to go to hell, ergo we must print money and do more public spending". 
The entire electronics sector has essentially been a part of the economy in permanent deflation since Moore's Law started. And yet, people are still buying new electronics, even though they could just wait a year or two and then buy the same gadget for a much lower price.

I meant illusions that Trump will have anything to do with Ron Paul or libertarianism whatsoever, except perhaps some lofty speeches to get their votes. Trumps is a big government authoritarian who wants to rack up debt to spend on infrastructure like Roosevelt, and on the military like Reagan, and he'll probably start money dumping on his base constituency like a Peron or Chavez. All of this is the complete antithesis to libertarianism, especially when added with surveillance and war on drugs and whatever similar shit he and his pronouncedly anti-libertarian (anti liberty, even) buddies Christie and Giuliani can come up with. 
I can respect an unemployed coal worker in W. Virginia voting for Trump, or someone who imagines murderous muslims being in ambush around every corner who votes for Trump. At least this makes sense and may even pay off, at least short term.

You still use bitcoin on the bitcoin network, and litecoin on the litecoin network etc. Each have special characteristics. Bitcoin is more secure, litecoin has shorter confirmation times etc. Each coin may be particularly useful to a specific use case.
Also, you are still selling LTC for BTC or vice versa. So someone is trading the other way around. It's not your LTC miraculously morphing into BTC or anything. It is not fundamentally different from shapeshift and other things we have today, just a way of making the swaps much faster *and* be able to do it in a more or less decentralized way (depending on how the marketplace, which is still necessary for buyers and sellers to meet, is construed).

If they *do* have more coins, then it would probably have been very hard to sell them on the black market without the publicity of the confiscated ones. It is probably not like you can just show up at your next door coin dealer and tell him you have the equivalent of an unknown Picasso,  yes sir, can I have a $80 Mil. plz. 
But now that the hullabaloo about the confiscated ones are out worldwide however, there may be "contacts taken" by people willing to buy the remaining ones (if they have any).

One of the biggest farms mining  "Ye Olde Bitcoyne" (as it was still spelt) could have up to 20 horse and buggy couriers, who ran back and forth to the nearest node to pick up the latest transactions, all handwritten on paper. Then if you found a block, a lad ran to the top of the building yelling that a block had been found, and started signaling the hash by semaphore.

No, you can't be sure of that. In fact, you may not be able to sell it outside of shady black market deals in 20 years, with the ever ongoing war on cash, which inevitably extends to war on cash-like property such as gold.
In 20 years, I expect *at best* to be forced to do endless KYC, proof of source of funds, verifications and justifications to sell gold for bank fiat money. 
And, since cash will be phased out - what will you sell your gold on a black market for? Bank transfers are censored. I guess bitcoin, but you don't believe in that so...
As for the industrial functionality of gold - sure, but only a small percentage of gold's value is related to industrial use. Most of the value comes from it's function as store of value, partly as direct storage, partly as storage in the form of jewellery (especially in India and other parts of Asia).
Don't get me wrong. I like gold, and I hold gold. But it is going to be severely squeezed by the ever expanding government control, just like cash. What we need for liberty is digital gold.

I think people are a bit on the edge when it comes to Bitfinex since the hack last summer. I know I am. Before the hack, finex seemed like one of the more solid and trustworthy ones, very far from Mt Gox shadyness. Then the hack happened and everyone fled, kind of. Only grudgingly did people return to them, but now this happens and people just lose confidence completely.
It's the fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice - phenomenon. It doesn't matter that it may be unfair as Bitfinex may be entirely innocent this time, but when it comes to money, you don't consider "fairness": If you lose confidence completely, you feel you need to take your money and run, that's what you do.
BTC-e and OKcoin are different, as they always had an aura of being slightly shady. You knew what you were getting into there. As miningmad below says, nothing much has changed there.

No blockchain can ever handle a significant portion of the world's coffee transactions on-chain.
You have to use 2nd layer scaling for that, regardless of which blockchain.
By far the most promising 2nd layer solution, which also happens to be consistent with bitcoin's principles of peer-to-peer, decentralized, censorship resistant (reasonably so, while not immune) payments, is Lightning.

Segwit *is* already raising the block size limit. Segwit as implemented already *is* a compromise involving Segwit + limit increase. 
I swear the moment Core would agree to Voorhees proposal, Roger Ver and Jihan would reject it and demand a Segwit + 2MB + 4MB + 2MB as the bare minimum, and claim that Core is just trying a stall by refusing to agree to a limit increase.
 As to the premise of your OP, almost all people have already agreed about the need for raising the blocksize limit. That is not contentious.

But Lightning isn't 3rd party trust. It's exactly what it is *not*. ChangeTip model is 3rd party trust. P2P network like LN is not. You don't give up your own money, you don't need to trust anyone or hand your coins over to a custodial service.
Why wouldn't there be a market/demand for near instant, trustless, P2P-transactions with fees considarbly lower than current (and future) on-chain transactions? Isn't that what everyone is complaining about when bitcoin doesn't deliver this?
We're not arguing whether LN can deliver on this, but you're saying that if it were to deliver this, no one would want to use that? That's ludicrous, and also invalidates all the complaints about current bitcoin transaction fees and delays.

Default functioning of most Bitcoin ATMs is:
You hold your phone wallet with a receiving address QR code to a scanner on the machine. Machine reads your address. You store the coins on your phone wallet.
Some (or most) machines allow you to alternatively print out a paper wallet that the coins you buy can be sent to, if you don't have a phone wallet with you, for example. You can then use any wallet capable of sweeping a private key to sweep the coins from the paper wallet (which you should do as quickly as possible after purchase is done - don't store that paper wallet as is, I wouldn't consider it a safe storage since the private key has been show potentially near CCV cameras and whatever).

Using deposits to provide loans is not fractional reserve banking.
Providing loans without the full equivalent of deposits, *that's* fractional reserve banking. And that is impossible with bitcoin. 
You can't accept 1 bitcoin deposit, then loan out 1 bitcoin each to 10 different people, because you have to actually have 10 bitcoin to do so. But with fiat, this is the normal procedure. Big difference.

The trollbox going away is the best thing that ever happened to the exchange. It's called trollbox for a reason. The amount of FUD and scams and pumps was ridiculous and 99.9% of the trollbox content. Crypto community is better off without it.
I bet they lost quite a few customers from it going away, but I also bet that was a deliberate and calculated choice, as it seemed at the time they were on purpose trying to cool down the insane influx of new users. My reading of that, and similar changes at the time (early summer this year) was that the exchange had seemingly come to a limit where they could not easily keep up with the flow of new traffic/users or scale with hardware fast enough, and simply had to signal "hey guys, we're full, for now, new users and some of the old please try some other exchange until we caught up". Just my assumptions, but still, that was my take away.

If however the attacker is also the entity who collects a large portion of those fees, the total cost goes down proportionally with the percentage of the total mining power they control. 
If a big block network leads to increasing centralization of mining (presumably in favor of the already big entity doing the attack in this hypothetical scenario), then the net cost for the spamming could well be equal or lower on the big block chain, especially if you factor in that the centralizing entity will also get a larger proportion of the block reward/subsidy as their share of total hashpower gets bigger.
At the end of the day, a few bucks spent on spamming is trival compared to the grand price and main battlefield: Who dominates mining in the future.

Main reason people may have 90% in bitcoin/crypto is because of the insane gains these assets have yielded. They (typically) didn't take 90% of their old money and put it in crypto. Instead, they took say 10% of their money and boom, two years later the crypto assets have gone up so much that they make up 90% of the *new* total. Which is like 10 times their old total. At this point one may (or may not) argue that they "should" sell off enough to reduce their crypto weight, but for various reasons that is often not what happens.

The tx fees don't simply disappear. They go to the miners. If it is a group of miners controlling a significant amount of the hashpower, they get most of the tx fees back, plus the extra high fees from regular users who must compete with the spam transactions during the attack. This could well total more than what they initially spent on tx fees. In addition, they get to make whatever political statement they might want to make, plus whatever potential profits from  market manipulations they can get by clogging the network.

1. Get any wallet software that supports seed phrase and allow you to access your private keys (which is most of them these days, Electrum is a sort of industry standard on a computer, and lots of all the mobile wallets out there).
2. Write down the 12 word seed (or 24 word or 13 word or whatever seed they use) in a safe place.
3. Transfer your coins to this new wallet.
4. Done. You can now use this wallet for your daily bitcoin needs, or delete the wallet from your computer (for extra safety) to turn it into a cold wallet, or throw your computer through a metal shredder, melt the remains, burn down your home, assassinate any untrustworthy relatives who might have been spying on you, for extra *extra* safety.

The CCP is run by old men set in their ideas since when they started  to rise in power 20-40 years ago. Don't assume they are super smart just because they are secretive and powerful. Just like the Soviet leadership, just like any petty dictator in the world, and indeed just like Western government leaders, they make huge mistakes, are ill informed and unable to comprehend the full implications of the newest tech and trends, even if they did care (which they probably don't) more about the future of their country than they do about profiting for themselves on their position, and advance/maintain that position. 
It is very likely the Chinese leadership is exactly as begotten with the idea that a strictly regulated and government issues currency is the superior and indeed only way to manage a country. Bitcoin doesn't fit into this in any other way than as a nuisance and potential threat (although most probably they don't even recognize that). The idea that the Chinese government would predict that Bitcoin will become the world reserve currency or anything like that, and take positions accordingly, is very unlikely.
You have an annoying mosquito in your room, you either ignore it, until it becomes too annoying - then you swat it down.

The digital coin is worth 6k because we (people like me) rather have that digital coin than some shitty fiat IOU held by some bank, limited to one country and the political whims of that country.
Sometimes we have to exchange our proper bitcoin to the shitty fiat IOUs in order to transact with people who haven't yet realized the shittyness of the fiat IOUs. But even this will change, as slowly more and more people realize that bitcoins are better than fiat IOUs, and eventually we can just stick to transact using bitcoins.
That's why it is worth 6k (currently).

Running a node means you run the main bitcoin program called Bitcoin Core. Initially this was the only bitcoin program there was, although we now have various mobile wallets and "light" clients and even web "wallets" like Coinbase and Blockchain.info. 
But running Bitcoin Core, you opt for the "full package" of being a bitcoin user. Your full node validates every block independently, and communicates with all the other full nodes on the network. 
When you run a mobile or web wallet or other light client, it works only because *they* are connected to some full node somewhere. In these cases you are dependent on that service's full node.
But if you run Bitcoin Core yourself, *you* are the full node and not dependent on some 3rd party. Bitcoin is a network of computers sharing the blockchain. Your computer is one of those computers, when you run Core.
When you run Bitcoin Core, you have two options:
1. You can run it just for your own peace of mind, letting it download the full blockchain (and whatever new blocks are added every 10 minutes) from other nodes and letting it validate all transactions. This gets you a very powerful bitcoin software.
2. Or you can go even further and open it up as a **full node**. That means that you allow your client to fully pass on information about the blockchain to other nodes. This way you help the network to stay decentralised.

The dollar fluctuates in value versus other currencies, depending on fundamentals. It's been dropping versus the Euro lately. Only reason this hasn't caused price increases yet is because the US economy is comprataively self reliant, and secondly because it takes time for the effects to take effect, to pass through the system, so to speak. A Car manufacturer that uses foreign parts will eventually have to raise his car price if those foreign parts become more expensive due to falling dollar.
A shitty currency will eventually  collapse, but it may take many years before the full effect takes effect due to systemic inertia. But the end result will be the same.

The aim of the 2x folks is to deny the existence of any other chain than their own. So very different from BCH fork. This is why they are choosing to not add replay protection. Basically saying "Why replay protection? We don't need that because there is only going to be one fork - our 2x fork. Legacy chain is going to die."
Problem is, they are most likely wrong - legacy fork *will* probably survive, and then there will be mayhem.
The 2x:ers are going for an "all or nothing" gamble. If they "win", in the sense that legacy chain dies, then they "win" control over all of bitcoin. Good for them! All our bases are belong to Jeff Garzik, Jihan Wu and Brian Armstrong. If they implemented replay protection on the other hand, it would be a signal that would for certain assure that the legacy chain survives and 2x and Legacy would have to compete on more even terms for everyone's attention and money. But the 2x "all or nothing" policy doesn't allow that. 
The problem is that if the 2x:ers are wrong, and the legacy chain survives in spite of their efforts to kill it, then their lack of replay protection might drag *both* chains down the abyss as transactions are replayed and no one knows where the F everyone's money is. people will get sued for losing other people's money left and right, what is the real bitcoin, what is the fake bitcoins etc.
So, huge difference from the BCH fork, because then everyone knew and agreed from the beginning that there would be two coins after the fork. Here, on the other hand, one side is betting everything on there only being their own chain surviving.
Complete insanity and recklessness, if you ask me.

This. Thank you. 
This isn't about upping the blocksize. It is about a hostile takeover attempt by a self-selected small group of corporations, miners and other entities that are 100% dependent on government and banker goodwill in their businesses. Whether there is an actual intent from banks and governments to use this takeover to set the stage for a  more government and bank friendly direction of bitcoin, or if that will *only* be the end outcome of a successful 2x takeover, I don't know. But if the governance of bitcoin becomes: "A number of important people get together behind closed doors and make a deal", then it is inevitable that those most important people will be largely the same people who run the Fed, the biggest banks and investment firms, the bitcoin future equivalent of Mark Zuckerberg and whatever politicians have most influence at the time.  
We are at a watershed moment in bitcoin. 1x or 2x the blocksize is completely irrelevant in this battle. What's at stake is future governance.

Yes, moving your coins to your PC wallet or phone wallet is all you need to do (assuming you have a backup of the seed for that wallet).
People keep talking about hardware wallet, which is nice if you have it, and makes it easier to stay fully safe, but it is not *necessary*, especially not for temporary storage, unless you keep huge sums of money on them.

The choice you have as a seller is to differentiate price between those customers who insist on using something that cost you money (PP), and those who choose the more efficient alternative (btc). If sellers start letting customers know "Yeah, it cost $100 here, but if you pay with bitcoin and/or go through my OpenBazaar store, I give you an X% discount", then you would start to see a shift in customers.
If all the hassle of getting into bitcoin first time is dumped upon the customer with no apparent benefit to them, of course they will frown and go somewhere else.

What the hell are you talking about "can't use it for actual use"? You can't use it for small transaction or micro transactions because the fee is high, correct. You can perfectly well use it for bigger transactions where the fee is still let's say &lt;1%.
Bitcoin was designed as a peer to peer digital cash system. You want to send $100 to someone across the world and have it arrive in less than 30 minutes, you pay 75 cents for this.
How is that " I can't use for it's actual use"? It's the actual use and what it was designed for.
Missing out on a future of micro transactions or coffee buys is unfortunate but luckily there is a solution (several actually) in the works for that.

Yes, this is important in any situation of chain split: If you just sit tight, do nothing, you will have coins on both chains (at least until you start to move any of them).
Of course, some people will rush to the exchanges and try to make a few bucks off selling coins from one of the chains, the one they think will lose. That's betting. Or who will try to support one chain or the other by selling the enemy chain. That's activism and may or may pay off financially and may or may help your side win.
But if you want to be neither a gambling man, nor an activist, just sitting tight for a couple of hours, days, or weeks or whatever it takes while the battle is fought, it is hard to lose any coins.
Price may have changed, but the coins will still be there, at least.

Indeed it is. 
There seems to be a constant organic growth that's been going on for a long time beneath the crazy antics of price action. Pressure from that fundamental growth sort of builds up until released in sudden price action like seismic tension in a fault line in the earth crust, which eventually gets released in an earthquake. 
Then all the pundits have to come up with plausible explanations for why this is happening now. But the reality is that it just had to happen sooner or later because it is where things are heading and the move was overdue. 
IDK, but that's how I see it. Markets will bubble,correct, stagnate and then bubble again, to higher than before because the continental drift of the financial system is stronger than temporary market acrobatics, and the continents are drifting in favour of bitcoin and other cryptos and fiat is sinking.

A buyer can easily - and should and most of the time do - avoid a seller with no reputation, no history. 
A seller has much more difficulty rejecting all customers whom they don't have a long history with, or require some kind of reputation.

Completely different situations. Kraken has a history of opportunistically supporting all sorts of altcoins. They just added EOS for example. It is not unreasonable for them to add BCC to their lineup of assorted alts. 
Coinbase  and especially Bitstamp have a completely different policy. Basically, being extremely restrictive with other alts. Remember Stamp only had BTC and (for some reason I don't know) Ripple, until they recently said "oh ok, maybe we should add a coin or two after all" and added LTC and later this year ETH is on schedule. It would be absurd to expect them to throw their company strategy out the window just because Jihan's decides to hand out a premine to bitcoin holders of his new shitcoin. They have no obligation to take part in BCC's marketing gimmicks.

I am talking about an eco-system consensus, not a miner consensus. I am aware that if 9X% of the miners, mostly big mining pools, agree to follow one chain, that affectes how the fork proceeds. But if the eco-system as a whole is split much more evenly, mining consensus doesn't give the whole answer to the impact the fork will have. If you think a couple of big miners trying to ram a 2x hardfork down the throat of a significant portion of the community, especially when that unwilling portion includes most of the Core team, and they will quietly accept this, then you neither have been paying attention to the last 1-2 years, nor understand how bitcoin works (again: as an eco-system, not merely mining-wise).
Most everyone can realize that Segwit is a good or acceptable thing fundamentally. A hardfork not so. A significant amount of people will resist a hardfork no matter what. Additional people will resist a hardfork that raises blocksize. An yet more people will resist a hardfork that was pushed through under the circumstances of the NYA. Finally, who knows what additional people will resist the hardfork on a technical basis once the code is even fully deployment ready. 
It is going to get contentious for sure.

Tether is a valid concern, sure. But separate.
But most people who wanted to get out of Finex started doing that two weeks ago (or more). "hat happens when transfers clears" may have been a valid concern then and a few days after the exodus started, that people having withdrawn bitcoion from Finex would start dumping tons of them on other exchanges. Since that hasn't happened, at least to an extent that has made price collapse, then why would it happen now all of a sudden? Most of the withdrawal must have happened by now. Why would people who want to exit then sit on their coins on Stamp without selling them? If selling them is what they indeed want.
People are going to be profit taking for sure in the near future, but I cannot see how Bitfinex is cause of that.

Not badmouthing Coinbase specifically, but the practice of leaving your money in the custodial hands of an exchange. Surely you have heard of the several instances of people losing money by leaving it on on ramps such as Mt Gox and Bitfinex and many other?
Using an exchange as an on ramp is fine. The problem is when you park your money on the on ramp, which is not what on ramps are suitable for.  The best practice is to use the exchange as an on ramp, and then keep driving to your home/destination and then park it there, not on the ramp.

Bob gets his computer hacked. Bob pays off hacker after buying bitcoin. But doesn't the hacker want a payout? You seem to assume that hackers hack shit just so they can accumulate bitcoins that they are not selling for fiat or other cryptos). This is unlikely.
Thus your claim is doubly improbable. Volume of ransomware market is unlikely to cover bitcoin price rise, and even if it was, you'd have to explain why all the hackers are just hodling their coins, not cashing out to fiat.

You miss the point: Compromises between a group of self elected business moguls is not the right governance model for bitcoin. If the NYA fails, it will be good for bitcoin precisely because it proves that decisions should not be made that way in bitcoin.
In fact, the whole debacle of the last 2 years of stalemate has happened *only* because a bunch of entitled bigwigs think they have the right to deal and bargain for their interest through secret backroom compromises with select other potantates just because together they control 51%+ of mining power and/or transaction volume. But this is the governance model of fiat, which is exactly the fundamentally failed model that we as bitcoiners should *not* revert back to.
Next time, you will have the Goldman Sachs and a few other big banks and then a government representative at the bargaining table. Then you can figure out where that will end. 
If it is proven that this kind of bigwig backroom compromises do not work, bitcoin will be better off.

People shouldn't buy significant investment money for their first buy anyway. 
Get Coinbase or similar, or get a decent mobile wallet. Buy your first $100, give it a couple of weeks at the very least to try it out, then maybe invest more.

He doesn't need to assume to convince everyone. It is enough to convince some, and to spread sufficient doubt among some more. 
That's how scammers always operate. OneCoin don't need to convince everyone, it is fine to them if most realize it is a scam, as long as *some* are willing to consider them seriously. They will say, "maybe they aren't all they say, but would there be all this ruckus about them if there wasn't at least *something* to what they claim? I better throw in some money, you never know, if this thing catches on."
Just look around the comments in this post. Lots of people say "I don't know if he is SN, maybe/probably/perhaps not, but...". Or others who are willing to "compromise" by saying "Maybe he wasn't the only Satoshi, but perhaps he was part of a group" or "maybe he did it with Kleinman, but...".
I am not saying he is intelligent, but he doesn't need to be stupid to attempt this, and whoever is backing him (his publicity tour(s) are according to all sources who come across them are very well funded) certainly doesn't need to be stupid for this to be highly successful operation, whatever the purpose that operation has - to spread FUD, to make a patent grab, to get publicity for himself or nChain or something else, to spread discord, to make a power grab, to block Segwit - it could be ANY of those or many other purposes. None of which depends on him gaining 100% recognition as Satoshi, or even 20% recognition.

Yes, it is very unlikely for now, with regards to the Segwit activation..
However, there is another fork event coming in 3 months. This is because the Segwit2x agreement contained two parts: one Segwit activation that could lead to a fork if it did NOT activate. The other part is the 2x hardfork that WILL lead to a fork if it does succeed. This Step 2 is set to happen 90 days after the first part happens.

What do you mean "are okay with"? The law is the law and those laws were in place long before bitcoin came around. Capital gains etc, whatever you have depending on country. It's not a *special* taxes specifically directed at bitcoin. It's just the normal tax of the country you live in.
If people were not okay being taxed whatsoever there would obviously not be any taxes in the world, but that is clearly not the case.


Decentralization of bitcoin per se doesn't have anything to do with living in a territory that applies taxation on it's inhabitants.
Obviously, if there were no taxes there would be no government, so in that sense your society would be decentralized, so to speak, however it was organized. Even that would not really have anything to do with whether bitcoin is decentralized or not.

I am sure your theories work fine for a centralized software project where the centralized entity can just push out updates and users quietly have to comply. Bitcoin doesn't work that way.

It is a commodity that is valuable because it allows you to do some things that no other commodity (or service) allow you to do. For example, to store and transfer value borderlesly with no censorship or interference by third parties (third parties including, but not limited to, the world's 200 governments, the vast majority of which are non-democratic and rampantly corrupt). There are other unique benefits it provides as well. 
Because of these unique benefits, people are willing to buy bitcoin. Because they do, this commodity has value, just like oil and platinum and wheat have value because people need them for the unique benefits they provide to the holder of them.
Speculation is really just on top of that, although because the unique benefits of bitcoin are all related to value, there is an extreme synergy between speculation and the fundamental benefits of bitcoin. 
This may be one reason why we have these bitcoin bubbles. Imagine if oil actually became *more* energy rich per gallon, allowing it to burn longer and hotter, when price went up (and vice versa). That's what happens to bitcoin when the price go up (and vice versa). 
Bitcoin is quite weird that way, and I am not sure we will fully "understand" it for a very long time.

If Satoshi came out of hiding after all these years to make such a statement, it would freak everyone out as it would prove that he was still alive and willing to engage with the community. Bitcoin price would tank as the probability that his coins might move one day would increase enormously.
To clarify, that statement "I am not Dorian Nakamoto" came from an account that had been compromised previously and is very unlikely to have been Satoshi's words. Last known communication from Satoshi is 2011.
There is no reason to believe that Wright was even part of a Satoshi group other than a desire to find a middle ground between "he is talking shit" and "he is telling the truth". Unless he can prove *anything* whatsoever, he should be treated no more credible than the lunatic on the street saying that he is the reincarnation of Abraham Lincoln.

Because a price bull run is also a possibility? No collapse (or rise) is ever guaranteed, or else it would already have happened. 
People always seem to think a market must be manipulated or suspicious when it doesn't move the way *they* presumed. But at any given moment, the "net" of all price predictions should be zero relative to the current market price. For every person willing to bet the price will rise $100 there is another one willing to bet it will fall $100 (or 10 people willing to bet it will fall $10).

The point of rights is that they are *rights*, and as such belong to you, not to the government. As such, rights by definition cannot be "withdrawn". They can be given up voluntarily by you, but not withdrawn by some other party (government in this case).

Which would make *a lot* of people happy. Probably including many of the signatories. 


We're talking about an agreement over an open source software protocol where virtually *none* of the actual developers of the project were part of the agreement. That alone disqualifies it from any pretense at being representative of the ecosystem.
Aside from that, bitcoin is a P2P digital cash system, which means average users and node operators are a huge - some would say central - part of the ecosystem. As a user/investor/node op etc, I distinctly remember not being invited.
Self-appointed businesses and bigwigs have a big influence, sure. No problem. But they do not *represent* users, investors or node operators just because they want to. Bitcoin is not a representative democracy (and these "representatives" weren't even remotely democratically elected anyway, just a bunch of self-appointed friends of Barry Silbert). *It is a decentralized system*. Which means there are no representatives. Decisions are taken by individuals through taking part or refusing to take part. There *can* be no representative agreement. Ever. It is impossible. This fact may be annoying and weird for anyone used to government politics or corporate management, but it's the basis for a decentralized system. if you don't like the idea of a decentralized monetary system, then probably bitcoin isn't for you anyway.

I think it depends on time frame. I agree a lot of people seem to think bitcoin will overturn banks and fiat and reach complete global adoption, within a few years at most, before Christmas at best.
25 years after the Internet had it's breakthrough moment of the introduction of www and web broswers (I think that's about where we are now in crypto, 'ish), mainstream media empires are still alive and kicking, but they are slowly crumbling. You've got to take a similar perspective on crypto. Banks will still be here in 25 years, but everyone will be talking about their big crisis as people no longer trust them or need them or want them anymore. Government will still use them to try and control the population, but it will be becoming obvious it is no longer working.
Fiat and the territorial nation state it has developed in symbiosis with will last for most of this century. But probably not much longer than that.

Contentious hard forks are inherently risky. HF with unanimous support are obviously not risky.
A 2xHF is likely to be contentious. Time will tell.

Since exchanges are about exchanging bitcoin for fiat, you could just as well say that fiat isn't working if exchanges aren't working. Equally (in)valid, equally dumb

Ver is the worst kind of populist politician. Dumbing something down to one mantra, then parroting that mantra over and over, completely resistant to actual reasoning. Ver represents everything that is wrong with politics of nation states and I hate it so much that he is bringing this kind of knuckledragger politics to bitcoin.

The community wanted it because their leader and all their leaders said it was the best choice. If Vitalik had said "Hell no, we ain't forking. Code is law, that's what we said from the beginning. It doesn't just apply when the outcome is nice for us, it has to apply always.", then support for a fork would have been close to zero.
If Vitalik says "We got to implement this blacklist thing (or whatever), trust me, it is best for Ethereum, oh, and government institutions will also invest money so ya'll see nice profits if we do this", then fork will happen exactly as whatever 3-letter agency requested it said.

Using Coinbase as an on ramp is usually fine.
The problem is that so many park their car on the on ramp, then walk away, trusting that the one traffic cop who was eating a donut on the on ramp will look after your car. Then they come back 6 months later and find to their surprise that the car has been towed away by the government (best case scenario) or stolen by some teenager who then used it to trade drugs and when you eventually get the car back, you get charged by the genius police for facilitating drug dealing.

Regulate miners - sure, possible.
Regulate devs? LOL? "I am a licensed developer. I am fully authorized by the government to write code. Don't use the software over there - one of the guys that wrote one of the libs used didn't have license to develop code."

Most users are fine with the *idea* of a compromise, at some point, of some sort. We, as humans, naturally are.
Since this was promoted as a nice big compromise, many people's first reaction was probably "Oh, good, a nice big compromise that everyone can agree on, that's awesome, I support such a compromise".
Then reality kicked in when the actual content/meaning of the compromise was examined. Although many people maybe never took that step and consequently still support it because they support the idea of a compromise that everyone is fine with.

Where do they get all their huge bitcoin reserves from, if they just keep dumping?
When do they replenish their large reserves and how do they avoid this affecting the market upwards?
Or are we to assume that they simply sell at the top (to spite bitcoiners) and then replenish their reserves at the bottom? I don't know, but usually this doesn't require an evil cabal with hidden agendas - it is usually known as "clever traders".

Indeed. Their hashrate will stay the same, but their energy costs will rocket 30%.
So I guess the consequences really depends how much subsidized energy he gets from Chinese authorities in exchange for subverting bitcoin.

Oh yes absolutely, they will try to ram this idiocy through. It is going to be a shitfest, but as usual with politics, it will take a few years for the consequences so the politicians who decided it can retire comfortably and leave the mess to someone else.

The UK elite has always been scared to the bone that one day revolution is coming. It's been like that since I think the French chopped the head off their king. Basically, they've spent the last 200+ years trying to prevent the masses from revolting, all the while preserving their stiff upper lip pretending everything is fine. I don't think there is any country where this permanent - yet unspoken of - paranoia has so completely dominated "conservative" policy.
Tory's love affair with surveillance has to be seen in the light of this. I think the 2011 riots, and where they *could* have gone, is part of all that is driving this. Although it sounds better to just shout about ISIS, rather than saying it's their own citizens they're afraid of.

Crash against what? Euro? Yen? Yuan? Ruble? GBP? Hardly impressive alternatives. Currency can only crash relative to another currency, and there are no other major currencies that look any more attractive (Bitcoin doesn't count, yet...).
Or you could say it *has* already been crashing towards other assets such as equity and real estate. You need a lot more dollars to buy a share of Apple today than you did 10 years ago.

Buying is rarely a problem if you use actual money a.k.a cash. Bank desposits are fine. 
if you insist on paying with those shady VISA or bank card/holdings, it's another story, of course. But who would want to deal with that shit anyway?  ;)
Cash or bitcoin, only proper money there is.

If you are truly curious to find out why, I recommend you watch some of Andreas Antonopolous youtube videos. It is a great starting point for beginners. He usually address many of the "why do people want this?" question and it will give you some ideas beyond what mainstream media will tell you.
He's got tons of videos and many that are aimed at understanding the what and why of bitcoin (leavge the more technical ones for later).
