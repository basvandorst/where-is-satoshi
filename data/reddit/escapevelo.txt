Bitcoin raised funds from a crowd, was that a dumb idea? I have no doubt in my mind this is the future of VC. It's faster, more fluid, and more adaptable. ICO vs stocks is like a smart phone vs land line.

Knowing and understanding exponential trends is crucial to successfully deploying ANY information technology. Saying solar power will not continue to exponentially lower in price is similar to arguing that delivering and storing free content to users through an app like Facebook 8 years ago wasn't feasible because data costs were too high. We all know how that turned out. 
Linear thinkers are such luddites, sometimes I really don't even know why I try.

To me this is just a milestone in the crypto venture capital revolution so I will fully support it. This event should shed some light that a company can raise money through an ICO AND investors can buy into their financial future.
In the future I expect most VC will be done with companies ICO's and then using profits to buyback their native token. It will make companies economic nation states and their will be millions of coins out there. Bitcoin and Ethereum will become the NYSE and Nasdaq of these coins as most will not want to worry about security of their coin. That's how I view this situation :)

I have blind faith in information technology because every single information technology I've ever seen grew exponentially or its next paradigm did after it plateaued. Not all technologies are exponential, all information technologies are if they are adopted though. Graphene would be an exponential information technology just like solar PV is since it's made out of a virtually unlimited resource. Graphene's price has been dropping exponentially since its discovery and should become cheaper than steel in 15-20 years. Please give me an example of one information technology that was adopted and didn't grow exponentially in price/performance and you might make me change my mind. 
@_date: 2016-08-29 10:43:33
Solar power is currently 1% of total energy production, funny thing about exponential growth is 1% is only 7 doubling from 100%. Yes overall energy consumption will increase, but not at pace in which energy prices will increase. As with any information technology price will continue on exponential trend towards zero.

Luckily we have a game changing information technology seeping into the financial sector, ...cough...Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-08-29 08:18:18
This is a battle of inflation vs deflation. The current financial system is inflation based, deflation is the enemy as our world of debt would collapse if deflation started to take hold. What most economist and bankers do not see is that information technology is making world inherently deflationary. Right now you have a billion dollars worth of 1970's computing power in your pocket for $300. All information technologies get exponentially better in price performance. It's not just computers, it's DNA sequencing, solar power, media, education, and hundreds of other things. Every year more industrial sectors seep into the information technology realm and start to become deflationary. Energy is one huge industry, this is reason oil prices have collapsed and this is just the beginning. Energy will continue its march downward in price as solar power will continue its exponential rise. It will be the same for manufacturing, transportation, healthcare, and construction. What happens to our inflationary debt based system when most things become cheaper and better every year? Something has to give.
@_date: 2016-08-30 07:28:55


Creating factories is part of the exponential process.


If we do reach physical limit that is when a new paradigm opens up. We hit a physical limit with vacuum tubes and we switched to transistors, then to semi-conductors. What's next quantum? There has to be a way to store energy more efficiently than lithium ion. Perhaps it will be graphene, perhaps not. My money is that a new paradigm will open up that makes lithium ion look like lead acid or vacuum tubes.
Even IF graphene can reach only percentage of lithium ion's density the potential applications are still countless. I truly expect that vehicle structures will be made entirely out of graphene capacitors. Making a structure that can hold a charge and is stronger and lighter than steel seems pretty good. Now if graphene can be x times more efficient than lithium ion, that will be a glorious world to live in.

Every hack of a banking system tightens the borders of their closed credit system cutting off precious users for growth. Bitcoin, however, is borderless open to all which can use those discarded users to grow ecosystems and applications to attract even more users.
Most of these attacks on Swift happen in 3rd world countries so it wouldn't be surprising at all if some of these banks were removed from the network discarding even more users.

One day there will millions of different coins, Bitcoin will be one core linking these coins together. To think that using a tool such as a token is being a "SHITCOIN" is fucking retarded. Creating a debt instrument to track customer lost funds seems like an awesome solution. Let the market bet whether Bitfinex will pay back the funds. If some customers disagree they can still always go the legal route. However, this solution allows customers to gain liquidity to lost funds instead of it being stuck in a legal battle for X years.

Bitcoin is the thing that started the whole crowdfunding era, its is a testament to VC revolution. From Bitcoin's humble beginnings we are seeing this technology move into uncharted area's and some will fail miserably, e.g., the DAO. However, that does not detract from the fact that cryptos are a far superior way to fund VC compared to legacy venture capital. This technology not only democratizes venture capital, but will also empower entrepreneurs and investors in ways we can't even think of now. 
The whole one coin to rule them all is so backward thinking. Yes, Bitcoin can be the core to many of these new networks and hopefully there will be millions of coins that thrive as sidechains on Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-08-06 19:01:20
I love the idea of creating a BFX token and using all of Bitfinex's future profits to buyback this token. Basically its like Bitfinex is doing an ICO for its entire company. If they buy back the BFX token with future profits, you as an investor are buying into their financial future.
I for one might be tempted to buy this token if this was the case.

Scaling is not an issue. Energy storage will soon become a full information technology when non-chemical based batteries like graphene start coming online. The fun starts when energy input/output and transmission rates become exponential opening many new exciting applications. Solar energy farming will become ubiquitous just like computing has. Most things we create will have solar collection and harvesting. Just like nature and plants, its just too efficient not to incorporate. We will farm solar on land, sea, sky, and space. One day our human descendants will create a Dyson Sphere capturing 100% of the Sun's energy and some naysayer will say scaling we be an issue too.

Impossible is a strong word, I completely disagree. The blockchain as a data storage device is an app and perhaps one of the most important apps ever created. Whether Bitcoin becomes the world's eternal uncensorable data storage device is unknown, but some blockchain will. It's not an impossible task to create scalable blockchain for data storage. Whichever blockchain becomes the defacto blockchain for data storage will likely be the most valuable, IMO.

But there is a market for this, a lot of people would benefit. Not just that it allows for more choices. Say someone is running low on funds, but spots that perfect item on eBay. They could potentially "cash out" the balance of their current work week and be able to buy what they want.
It also allows for cheap credit if your earnings history were in a wallet. Someone could authorize a credit service app to take deduct future earning automatically with a simple contract. Credit for people without bank account has broad implications. Or you could even have secured cheap loans with backed by crypto assets.

It falls apart when you have asymmetrical betting. If one person wants to bet $1,000 but 10 people want to bet $100 for example - and if those bets roll in at different times (so, different spreads). You will need the bookie (market maker) to facilitate this.
I think it would be like any market. If bets are not getting filled, lines would adjust to market prices. There would still be market makers just like in any market creating liquidity but charging extra by upping/lowering lines. Using bitcoin to facilitate betting would make a much more efficient system.


What I'm saying this not being done by individuals in sports betting world, but could be done with bitcoin, adding a layer of functionality that currently doesn't exist. 


I think the revolutionary parts come from the blockchain. Solving the Byzantine General's problem.

That is where you are short sighted and not seeing the big picture. Bitcoin can usher in a new paradigm of cash flow, real cash flow. Bitcoin can make accounts payable/receivable a legacy system. Why not have all good and services paid for in realtime? Why wait until the end of the the month for money to arrive? That is inefficient and slow. Real time inventory/services tracking could be done through the blockchain making it more efficient, secure, and less susceptible to fraud. Think BOD (Bitcoin on Delivery, much like COD of the past).


Credit card companies already see all your transactions, its not a huge leap in privacy concerns for your bitcoin wallet to know your purchase history. In addition, it could be much more like a FB ad. Advertisers don't know you personally but know your likes and can serve more relevant ads. In the same way retailers could know what you like and offer products at discount based on that.


No bitcoin is a sliding scale of anonymity and transparency, it can be both. Eventually real names and businesses will have addresses associated with them, just like email today. So I could search for parents that are open to donations that spent 80% of their BTC at food merchants (who also have bitcoin accounts).

P2P sports betting is the future. No 10% off the top by the sports book. Connect to two bettors together to create the contact for a small fee, use bitcoin functionality for escrow and execution. Then contracts can be traded. Injury before the game sell the contract for profit/loss when the line changes. Make in game bets with an ever changing line just like options on stock exchange that near expiration. It is just a superior platform for betting. Bitcoin will swallow the 200 billion sports book market in 5 years tops.

I think the comparison is spot on. The Bitcoin network does have a network effect much like social networks or search engines. Those adoption rates have been exponential S curves which so far the Bitcoin network has also shown. 
The value of BTC comes from the Bitcoin network and its ecosystem. As long as the network continues to grow, BTC will also grow in value. If BTC has value it will be traded for good or services and act as a currency.

I don't think affordability applies to bitcoin in the sense you are talking about. To me it more about like the early Internet with providers building out infrastructure which hasn't gotten cheaper over time. Investment and profit built out the networks for the Internet. With bitcoin its the speculators investing the capital that is allowing miners and developers to build the network. Right now we can buy a part of this network and reap quite a reward, but those entering the network near the top of the S curve will not. However they will still benefit from it's existence just like someone that uses Internet, but not like someone who was an early investor of say Cisco.

You are not understanding the dynamic of BTC float. The amount of BTC available for buying/selling. When the bitcoin ETF's hit the market, now that bitcoin is treated as property, many institutions will be able to buy. If the current float of bitcoin's market is 20-30% an influx of 2-3 billion could makes the price rise 3 to 4 times pretty easily. I'm not sure if anyone knows what these true numbers are though, I'm just guestimating.

Right now there is unneeded friction with fiat which impose a tax, slow the flow of money and add stops to the final destination. A massively adopted cryptocurrency would speed up the flow of money by a huge factor. Is Bitcoin the answer? I'm not sure but I know for sure some form of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology is. It comes down to this simple fact that cryptocurrencies remove an extra stop from the process of sending money. Fiat is A-&gt;B-&gt;C and cryptos are A-&gt;C on the Internet.

To quote Marc Andreessen who can say it better than I ever could:
“The market cap of the ledger needs to be high enough to accommodate all of the value that wants to PASS THROUGH it in any period of time (volume &amp; velocity of value passing through),” Andreessen wrote. “So then, the intrinsic value of a BTC is emergent from the functional value of the ledger as a way to exchange value (or, more accurately, emergent from the collective forecast of the future volume &amp; velocity of value that will pass through the ledger).”
I think there is a better analogy than the one you defined. By buying BTC you are buying a transport vehicle on the bitcoin network. Right now they might be a small passenger vehicle but over time each BTC might carry much more value like a huge cargo train. If you envision one day that many asset classes like stocks, digital goods and property will be transported on this network the value of the vehicles should increase exponentially with the market cap of the network. Buying BTC pays miners to builds more tracks allowing more trains to move at the same time.

It's not a waste of energy because it's the only way (currently) to have a *trusted and secure* payment system without a need for a 3rd party. Think of all the infrastructure and energy the fiat banking system takes (branches, vaults, security, computing power, workers, printing bills, etc). Bitcoin can replicate all this with miners. If we had to compare them I would venture to guess bitcoin is magnitudes of order more efficient in energy use.

Obviously cryptocurrencies will always have some sort of fees for transactions. The question is whether those systems will allow for lower overhead, more efficient use of resources, and provide faster more convenient services than what current banking systems provides. In the same way Amazon is destroying brick and mortar, cryptos may allow service providers to do the same to the banking industry. The Internet has taught us that web companies can provide the same services (or even better) than brick and mortar with much less overhead and use of resources. I think there is a good chance cryptos will do it also.

What risk would it be to me or anyone to facilitate the bets and charge a 1% fee to make the contract? There is no risk at all. What risk do the bettors have? It's a no brainer for bettors 1% vs 10%. By the way there are sites that already do this. 


Yes we do. This new technology works better in every single way, other than stability which has been lessening as liquidity and the market grows. Why use a smart phone vs a feature phone? It has more utility and makes our lives easier.  It's no different with bitcoin. There is so much wasted energy/fees/time in with analog currencies. It's all about making a faster, more efficient system, that has magnitudes of order more utility.

Ok now you are starting to get it. Think robotic. It has inputs and outputs. Based on on conditions it can move and go to the right place without anyone touching it. And not just move, but move at the speed at light and be at that place physically ready to spend again in 10 mins.
I'll give a small example of its utility and a market it will swallow whole. Sports betting. Sports books take 10% off top of any bet. They need to do this so they can hedge bets and make a profit. If you assume any bet has an opposite and equal side in a bet by adjusting the spread, you then can put those bettors together in peer to peer betting with bitcoin. Once the contract is made, there is no escrow risk and no 3rd party that handles the funds. Once the game is done the money goes to the winner with the built in functionality of bitcoin. Only a minor fee needs to be charged to create the contract. Sportsbooks cannot compete with the technology and renders them obsolete. 
Not just that it allows for a better system. Imagine once you create a contract or a bet, it could be traded. You could sell a contract before the game starts if an injury occurs for a profit/loss. Buy a bet with 1 min left. There are endless possibilities. Not only would it create a more efficient system but a more engaging one that is not possible with the legacy ones. This is a simple app to create with bitcoin that could destroy a 200 billion dollar industry. This is just a minor app. Can you see bitcoin's potential now?

Since its a cash transaction, the delivery company would have to let you verify contents before signing.

The way I like to see it is that we found an absolute better method of transporting value in the form of ANY digital assets across the Internet. Cryptocurrencies tokens (coins) in general are storage containers for value that are extremely secure, instantaneous, p2p, and have i/o. The i/o on the storage containers allows them to be autonomous and resolve contracts that can be scripted into the container itself. This allows these containers to can act as escrow or an arbitrator to decide where to go once conditions are met in the contract. 
The blockchain is a public ledger in the case of bitcoin that resolves every 10 minutes and updates all transactions that have ever occurred on the network. Miners record these transactions with computing power and broadcast them to every other miner. The miners are paid by being awarded newly minted bitcoins for their work.

The Bitcoin network is a creation, storage, and transportation system for digital value. It is for this reason many call it the Internet of Money. Because there is no need for 3rd parties to clear settlement of transactions, sending value with Bitcoin is much like sending bits of data over the Internet. 
The bitcoin tokens (btc) are like trains that transport value on the network. As the network gets larger and more value is being transported on the network the size of the trains will increase with the bigger loads (meaning the value of bitcoin will increase).
Currency is only the first app, one day almost anything with digital value will be easily be stored or transported over the Internet with blockchain technology.

Yes, we need SegWit, but the miners do not. Profits are quite good right now. I mean tx prices are at an all time high and hopefully they will keep going up! Why would miners want to risk anything while profits are piling through the roof. You know the old saying, "If it ain't broke why fix it?"

The Doge community seems to be very strong, but market sentiment is terrible. I see value there. The founder left the project, price has plummeted and I see some Dogecoiners jumping ship to Bitcoin. I like to see 'Blood on the streets" when I buy. If Bitcoin gets to a new ATH, I expect a lot of Bitcoin's market cap to flood other altcoins like it has before. Because the market cap of altcoins is so much smaller that bitcoin we will see a faster acceleration in price if that happens and huge jump in altcoin/btc prices. It's a calculated risk where I could potentially lose 5% of my bitcoin stash but potentially double it.

Does anyone else think the bitcoin ecosystem will solve this problem on its own? When miners purchase electricity, materials, etc in bitcoin and other companies realize its cheaper and more efficient to do b2b transactions in bitcoin there will be less fiat leak. We are slowly moving in in a direction of wide acceptance and now we need applications that make bitcoin a better system to use for businesses. Things that are only possible with bitcoin technology. Say like a system allowed manufactures to instantly know when any of their products sold or resold in any outlet. This is possible with bitcoin and would completely disrupt supply chain models and incentivize bitcoin use.

There would be no competition. The proprietary transactional information would be monetized to undercut any competitor. LN hubs data must be open for all to see or no one to see. There is no gray area. It gives too much power to a few if this is allowed to happen and potential for major abuse. It doesn't scare you that potentially one company could be sole owner of majority off all transactional information that occurs on the Bitcoin network?

The tickets could be validated by the issuer, perhaps like all tickets are based for this event are only on this encrypted token class key. This class event token could easily be verified I would think, but I'm not a encryption expert. 
Decentralization would allow for many different platforms to be built for this type of ticket distribution and trading. It would also add more versatility so you can trade/buy/sell without any centralized fees or control, IMO.

Many economists say deflation is bad but we are moving fast to a deflationary economy. It's been happening for years hardly unnoticed. All information technology is inherently deflationary. Computers, DNA sequencing, solar power basically anything that is a information technology gets twice as good and 1/2 as cheap every doubling cycle. Why does anyone buy this technology if you can get one cheaper and twice as good in 18 months or less? This deflationary model hasn't ruined our economy because of the productivity gains you get from the technology. Every year information technology swallows new sectors of old analog industries causing greater deflation. This trend is speeding up not slowing down. Energy is a huge one and solar (PV) has steadily been doubling in watts/installed and halving in price since it's creation. Wonder why oil is cracking in price? How can we continue an inflationary monetary system when one day majority of all products created will be deflationary. It doesn't make sense, something has to give.

This fight started with big blockers vs small blockers but not has morphed into something completely different. Miners have tasted the fee honey pot and Segwit with LN is the competition. BU is gaining traction amongst miners not for scaling per se, but manifest destiny in that they can control blocks and this fee honey pot. We had a window a few years ago where miners goodwill would of allowed a block size increase as tx fees were minuscule and irrelevant to the miners bottom line. That is no longer the case and now I doubt we'll ever get to fix malleability without firing current miners or a chain split. 
This fight is no longer about big blockers vs small blockers, it's really about developers and users vs miners.

The cost will always exponentially move towards zero. Do you realize you have a billion dollars of of 1970's computing power sitting in your pocket? In another 30 years you will have trillion dollars worth of 1970's computing power for a few hundred dollars. The same for storage. So yes, storing data in blockchain will be the cost of dust. Eventually we will store any information that has value in blockchains because the cost is so little.

500 billion doesn't seem that large. The price of bitcoin is an emergent property of the value that wants to pass through or be stored on the blockchain. 
If you understand that Bitcoin is nothing more than programmable network to create, store, and transport value across the Internet, it's not hard too see how trillions of dollars of value will be passing through it's ledger someday. Stocks, digital goods, basically anything with digital value can be stored and transported on this network, it's not just currency. It's the Internet for digital value. $500 billion is nothing.

That is not what I'm proposing. I'm saying is it possible that a $.50 chip can pay for itself at the same time reducing the cost of device whilst adding functionality that didn't exist? Can the electricity paid by the user subsidize these costs? If these chips take off a smaller percentage of bitcoin's will be converted back to fiat boosting the price making them more profitable. It's an interesting scenario, one in which we cannot say for sure what the outcome will be.

You misunderstood my example of the oil industry. Solar will swallow the oil industry in terms of energy production because it is a information technology. Already there was more renewable power plant installations this year than non renewable. This will not just continue but grow exponentially. (see [Law of Accelerating Returns]( Information technologies grow exponentially so I know it's hard to believe their growth, but trust me its happening. You may say solar may be an S-curve and the growth will level off , but we will just switch to a new paradigm. I don't see solar power growth slowing until we have a technology like a Dyson sphere collecting 100% of the sun's power.   
My question is, what happens when other information technologies come online like 3D printing become ubiquitous? Imagine when almost any product you can imagine can be printed in minutes or seconds (this goes for food too). It will be a deflationary tsunami. Why have an inflationary monetary system when everything always gets cheaper?

It allows manufactures of devices to subsidize the cost with the lifetime value of mining. Manufactures can sell cheaper devices with buyer knowingly or unknowingly paying for the electricity cost.

The first DNA genomic sequencing had a budget of 3 billion and took 15 years to complete. 7 years into the project all the naysayers like you said it was a waste of money because they had only completed 1%. I bet you can guess what happened, they finished the project in time. DNA sequencing costs a few hundred dollars and can be done in less than a day. This is the power of exponential growth.
The funny thing about exponential growth is at 1% you are half way to 100%. Guess what? Total supply of solar power is 1% as of 2014. It may not be obvious to people that cannot comprehend exponential growth, but we are only 7 doublings from being 100%. Another 7 doublings it will be a 100 times bigger than that. In 20 years solar will be producing 100 times more energy than the total capacity we have today. I have been following solar very closely since 2007 and it keeps just growing at 30% every year (actually since it's PV creation in the 1970's).
As far as the Law of Accelerating Returns, you are partially right. No one paradigm grows forever, but paradigms change and the new one grows even faster than the old one. Examples for computers are machine counting, vacuum tubes, and the current paradigm integrated circuits. Moore's Law will end but we will just switch to a new paradigm like carbon or quantum computing. 
I assert that information technology disproves the deflation myth as the gain in productivity outstrips  the purchasing power gain. A supercomputer that cost a million dollars in the 1980's and was the size of a room now fits in my pocket. My smart phone is a 1000 times faster and much more capable than that million dollar computer. What you may not see is that information technology is enveloping all industries. Once an industry becomes an information technology it will have enormous deflation. 3D printing will eventually upend the manufacturing, construction, and food industries. 3D printing speeds/resolution have growing exponentially for quite sometime. Nestle has already started research for food printer ( However the holy grail is atomically precise 3D printing. At the point we could print anything though we are about 30 years from doing that.

The point is that bandwidth on average increases by 50% over the total world, upload and download. Australia is a few years behind in Internet adoption so it will take them those years to get to what the US or S. Korea has. Africa and other 3rd world countries are even further behind in adoption but they still grow at 50%.  
I personally have lived through and seen this growth first hand starting with a 14.4k baud modem in the 1993 to 300Mb in home connection now. I did some quick math, it took 11 yearly increases of 50% to go from 14.4kb to a 1Mb. I remember when I got DSL for the first time in 2003 with 1Mb and it was fucking awesome that I could download a song in a minute. 14 years later I am exactly on pace with a 300Mb in home connection now. I actually can't even believe it's that accurate, I had to do a double take. 
I can understand being conservative but 17% growth is far below the growth of all other information technologies like CPU, storage, and bandwidth. If Emin does his study and we see nodes increase bandwidth by over 50% again next year will you change your view?

It will start with phones, but the Internet of Things devices will be trillions of devices. If the manufactures of these devices can subsidize cost with lifetime mining value perhaps the devices might be close to free. As the consumer you get a very cheap device while the cost is electricity. It's sort of like getting a free phone from a phone carrier but having a contract. Manufactures will figure out how to make it profitable. In any case this is very bullish for Bitcoin as if 21inc becomes the dominate mining pool a much smaller percentage of bitcoin's will be sold.

Being first to market matters a lot. If I were Blockstream I would be ready to rollout payment channels and hubs day one. Long term though monopolistic effect would come from the propriety data from the hubs itself. From my understanding of LN hubs, only the hubs can see the data being routed sort of like a black box. Even if this data has no identifiable user information the meta data will be invaluable. If they can monetize this data it will reduce the cost of running their networks giving them an unfair advantage compared to competitors.

What if manufactures of devices can subsidize the cost of the product with the lifetime value of mining? The manufacturers get a portion of the mining profits along with the user and 21inc. It all depends what the average lifetime mining profit for the device is.

This is especially true of 21inc is giving away these chips at cost or below cost or maybe even free?

It's not until we have these assets or goods on the blockchain will majority of Internet users be buying into bitcoin knowingly or unknowingly. Crypto equities + Kickstarter hopefully will be the main driver of asset creation and purchasing. Every time a digital asset is created and purchased on Bitcoin's blockchain, that is real GDP growth for Bitcoin's digital economy. Think about how Oculus went from $0 to $2 billion in a year. These crowdfunded companies float of shares offered to the public would be added to Bitcoin's market cap.

Read between the lines. This whole game between miners and Blockstream is completely about who control's tx's and nothing else. Miners don't want segwit because they want the profit from tx's. Blocksteam wants Segwit so they can roll out businesses on the 2nd layers. As a user I want both on chain scaling and Segwit. I guess I'll be keeping the coins on both chains if it comes to that.
As a side note, I do believe Blockstream and Core do have good intentions for Bitcoin in general but as with anyone they still cater to their own self interests also.

Sorry to inform you of this, but stocks are going the way of the land line. Venture capital will be transformed by cryptocurrencies. It is completely superior technology compared to "stock certificates." Bitcoin was the first crowd funded project, but Ethereum has truly shown us the way of how to fund a venture capital startup. 
Cryptocurrencies are more adaptive, agile, and synergic with financial systems then stocks. Cryptos lower the barrier of entry, speed up funding, and can be completely regulated by software. In addition to all this the end user will have a whole plethora new features available to them. I love the idea of taking a chance on a new product and at the time owning a piece of the company just with a simple purchase. Getting special privileges or deals based on what companies I own. All this data can be instantly known and synergized with an open profile of what cryptocurrencies I own. 
That being said there is still a lot of work to be done in the space. A regulatory framework still needs to developed so founder's tokens, funds, etc are locked like IPO's in existing financial markets.

It's not about file copying or preventing piracy, it's so much more. Digital goods on the blockchain will democratize publishing allowing full control of content by creators. A content creator could allow streaming services to license their content and know exactly how many plays and get paid instantly. It also allows content creators to make limited edition or collector items, which cannot exist now. These digital goods will be as hard to counterfeit as a bitcoin token so they will be rare and perhaps hold more value to some.
There is over 100 billion of digital goods locked in centralized systems like iTunes, PlayStation, Steam, and Amazon. This is not good for users. I want to be able to resell my digital goods. Why can't I? Because it digital? Bullshit. This will happen because users want it.

I agree it baffles me how the community can't see how this scales to billions, if not trillions of devices. Free electricity is free electricity.

The issue I see with this argument is that a for profit company will be hard pressed to be priced out of competition by larger blocks. Nodes, yes, miners no. It will be interest by even the largest most powerful miners to keep the block size just large enough to maximize tx fee profits. Eventually they might even collude with in cartel like fashion to maximize profits. Without off chain scaling there is no competition except for other completing blockchains which is bad for Bitcoin.

There is a good chance that  the crowd funding crypto equity space will be the driver of this next adoption phase. It would only take a few solid companies to do this. Imagine if Oculus or any other crowdfunded company used Bitcoin to launch it's crowd funding? The value of each of these companies will be added to Bitcoin's market cap.

Do you realize how big the Internet of Things market is going to be? I have over 40+ internet connected devices in my house already. There are already billions, the market will be trillions in the 5-10 years. This market is growing exponentially.
Let do some math with few assumptions because I'm curious too: 1) 100 million devices 2) 21inc becomes the largest mining pool at 35% 3) it occurs after the halving bitcoin so 25 bitcoins a block.
1800BTC/day * .35 = 630
at a price of $300 = 630 * $300 * 30 / 100mil = $.0567 a month per device
at $1000 = 630 * $1000 *  30 / 100mil = $.189 a month per device
at $5000 = 630 * $5000 * 30 * / 100mil = $.945 a month per device
Even at $300 $.05 a month per device is pretty good. Now you may say there is no way they ever get the majority the pool, but I bet they are banking on it and have already tested it. Like I said before if they give the chips away for free, add functionality, and allow the manufactures of the products an extra revenue stream to lower the overall cost of product it's a win/win. I don't think consumers are really going to notice an extra few dollars a month in electricity.

Its an attack vector on the Bitcoin's user base. They use a weakness in Bitcoin's current limitations and revenue generated by the altcoins to even generate more spam, its a direct reward response. It's possible they can create complete chaos in Bitcoin by pushing the lower limit of bitcoin transactions higher and higher until transactions fee's bubble to inconceivable levels.

There can always be a free service when there another way to monetize the business. What if the service allows to create betting contracts for free, but trading them costs a fee? Market makers will be the most obvious avenue for revenue, just like Google and FB offer free services but make money from business advertising.

Why should it be independent from Bitcoin itself? I personally want an app that allows users to put timestamped information into the blockchain. The app would verify if the this information was unique and users would know if they were to first to create this information on the blockchain. Why not use Factom or some other system? Because fuck other blockchains. Bitcoin's is the best and I know it will around for a very, very long time. I'll even pay a premium to know that my information is saved forever. In time this app could create billions of transactions on the Bitcoin network. Wouldn't this be good for Bitcoin? Why limit the use cases for the blockchain?

This is why a fee event is inevitable and it's going to be ugly. Miners will not be too motivated to HF to a solution until the price of BTC drops dramatically as they are generating more revenue. 
@_date: 2016-03-02 18:01:59
I wouldn't be so fast to make that assumption. I'm expecting there to be a fee event which will be caused by panic for the exit to altcoins. I don't really see a motivation for miners to fix the system until there is dramatic price drop in BTC as they will be generating extra revenue. The move that is already occurring to altcoins gives fuel to spammers to makes the problem worse as the altcoin market caps move much faster. The spammers see this vulnerability and there is a direct reward response for causing these problems. This whole scenario is only possible because there is an exploitable resource in Bitcoin HODLers, which I'm included. Any other market would reach a natural equilibrium, but miners and developers take HODLers for granted. 
I honestly don't expect $20 transactions fees, but I totally can see 1000x to $5.

Buying debt with with 1 or 2 percent return with the potential for the value of these bonds only to go down once rates are raised. It seems like it's a game of hot potato. What happens to these banks if they are stuck in a situation where they have to hold these bonds but the value plummets because there is crisis in which rates skyrocket.

I used to think we would have crypto-equity, but I now realize we already have it in the form of tokens. This is why sidechains are so important. I imagine a day where most businesses will have their own currency as a sidechain. If someone would like to buy into this company's financial future, you just buy their currency. But why would their currency have any value though? One simple reason, the business, DAC, DAO, or even an individual will convert their revenue into this currency, most likely at the POS. This would create a beautifully elegant transparent system to show the capital inflow/outflows of said business in real time.
"Stock certificates" are going the way of the land line. We have a superior technology that is better in everyway. I love the idea of taking a chance on a new product, loving it and then immediately buying into a company's financial future. A token based venture capital system has so many advantages over legacy VC it's difficult even to list them. Obviously the most glaring are speed of funding, lowering the barrier of entry, and the synergy with other crypto financial systems. In additional to all this the end user will have the greatest benefits as a plethora of new features, deals and special privileges will be available to them based on what tokens they own. It will be like owning a stock and reward/club discount card all at the same time. 
Bitcoin will become the new NYSE when sidechains come along.

No, my premise is that what the first mover can acquire proprietary data that no one else has access to. Information is power and if you do not understand that you are a sheep. Imagine if the web was set up so only the first spider that accessed web pages was the one allowed to store and keep that content. Google would've never had a chance. Sure you could entice new web pages to use your spider, but the incumbent would have far more advantages and funding to make you irrelevant. This is dangerous path for Bitcoin to go down if indeed hubs are allowed to gain access to proprietary data.

Huh? Basically all cryptocurrencies that exist today come from forking Bitcoin's code or a derivative of it. That's not what gives a cryptocurrency its value though. It's network and community does. By investing in a crypto you are speculating on the economic future of the network and use of the tokens. If the lead maintainer does not live up to your standards you can sell anytime and invest in something else that you think is doing it right. 
I personally invest in projects that I think will add unique features or functionality to the Internet of Value. I hold quite a few alts because I think these projects have merit and want to support them. Having a single point of failure like the lead maintainer dying in a plane crash is a risk you take with any startup. I worry less about the government boogeymen though.

Unless of course, the nodes that carry this information are more successful and perhaps the only way to be profitable. 
As much as I want to Bitcoin to be as decentralized as possible, I think it is impossible. Mining will continue to centralize because it is the natural evolution of the universe. Decentralization leads to centralization, which bursts (in the case of humans, revolution) and creates a more complex form of decentralization. The cycle is endless. It began with the big bang which was nothing by hydrogen atoms and has continued on to molecules, single cells, DNA, farming communities, cities, states, democracy, the Internet and so on. If Bitcoin is allowed to grow unbound it will become like the Internet. It will be decentralized enough that not one single entity will be able to control it and too important to be shutdown. If you keep it too decentralized it will wallow in an evolutionary dead end, IMO. 
Perhaps this HF if it occurs is an example of centralization leading to decentralized system. For a long time we had only one bitcoin client, tempers are flaring and a HF (revolution) occurs. For the first time we have many completing clients, bitcoin clients are now more decentralized.

Who knows? It's like asking what applications will computers run when first invented. Unlocking the vast troves of unused computation and storage on the Internet is a good start though. From there is will move to other aspects of the sharing economy perhaps. The cool part is that ETH acts as a crowdfunding platform like a stock market where ICO's can get funding and then the dAPPS synergize with the entire ecosystem. Having the decentralized storage system, Swarm, is a game changer though. One killer app will allow users have complete control over their information and pry it away from the like of Google, FB, Reddit, Instagram, etc. allowing users to directly benefit from the information they create. The power of decentralization is to democratize power taking it away from the few and giving it to the many.

Ok so what happens if miners never decide to fix malleability and decide to switch to BU so they can control the block size. How do you expect this scenario to play out? IMO this is a complete power play in who gets to control the future of bitcoin tx's. With BU we get an OPEC like cartel that gives us just us just enough blocksize to make miners very profitable. With strictly off chain we get a company that is planning to monopolize off-chain tx's. It's quite the dilemma. 
@_date: 2017-03-13 19:04:36
That seems like a worst case scenario that is possible. However, it seems more likely they will act like OPEC and just give users just enough block space to keep tx's fees sky high keeping them super profitable. Won't creating large blocks make tx's fees going to near 0? Miners want control of tx fee honey pot and stalling 2nd layer off-chain solutions is in their interest.

AWS might have given nodes a slight bump, but bandwidth increases by 50%. You geniuses think a 17% growth rate in bandwidth is how we got from 14.4k baud modems to our Internet bandwidth now.

Won't the original chain become nearly useless to use for quite a while? Say the mempool jumps to 1+ million plus then with the reduced hashrate block times will be much slower. It seems original chain will be paralyzed for weeks. I don't see how dumping the forked coins in that situation could ever be good investing decision. Let the dust settle then evaluate. I know I'll be keeping coins on both chains and buying when there is blood on the streets on either chain.

As a thought experiment lets say the so much data was being stored on the blockchain we needed terabyte blocks. For this to ever come to be either rewards for mining these blocks would have really high and/or total transactions fees to offset the increased cost of mining. In either case the value of the said blockchain would be worth more as it grows. Why give this growth to a different blockchain? If there is any blockchain that could pull it off, it's bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-01-22 21:52:55
I say stop being paranoid. The blockchain has use cases that requires bigger blocks. We have many new apps emerging that use the blockchain as a way to store information. These include notary, time stamping, and messaging services like  There are probably 1000's other of apps that will be built also.
If these apps have valid use cases AND are storing data on the blockchain, how can small blocks ever be the solution? These apps cause user growth and add functionality to the bitcoin ecosystem. As a bitcoin holder I see these apps as essential to its growth. By keeping blocks small we are forcing these apps to choose a different blockchain stunting bitcoin's growth and value.

It's more like the government outlawed cable companies from providing Internet services because it would put dial-up Internet services out of business and create monopolies. Oh wait it happened, and the Internet still works.
Mining centralization won't be that bad, just like ISP's centralized. Get over the paranoia, mining needs to move to big leagues if we are ever going to have terabyte, petabyte, or exabyte blocks. Bitcoin will be decentralized enough that one entity will never control it and too important to ever just shutdown like the Internet. Bitcoin seriously needs to ditch the lunatic libertarian fringe that is scared of the big bad government takeover.

At what point would it be not ok for you to transfer $1350? $5, $10, $25, $50? Right now no one is really complaining about fees because the btc price is going up. This bull run will end eventually and at that point, if no scalability is implemented, there is only going to be so many liferafts on the Titanic. Those that can afford to do tx will so do while other will be priced out of the network. It's a disaster waiting to happen and miners are licking their chops. I predict by the end of this bull run total tx fees will exceed the block reward in a single day. In the end though, like most bubbles the entire community will be hurt.

I urge you to rethink what Bitcoin's blockchain is. It's not a ledger, in fact, it's an immutable data storage device. It is the most wondrous data storage device ever created. Mankind finally has an incorruptible, undeletable way to store information. Storing information to Bitcoin's blockchain, IMO, is a more important app than its potential monetary uses. 
Bitcoin also is not a payment network in my eyes, it's a way to create, store, and transport value just like the Internet does for bits of data. However, there is much information with very high value that needs to be treated as if it was money. Bitcoin is the perfect platform to secure, store, and transport this information.
Many will argue that Bitcoin's blockchain should not be used as a data storage device. We should put it on on another blockchain. My arguments against this:
* Why trust another blockchain to safeguard this valuable information if we don't trust other blockchains to safeguard our monetary value? 
* The use cases that attempt to store data forever only strengthen Bitcoin's blockchain chances to exist forever.
* Information that is stored on Bitcoin's blockchain will add much needed network effects increasing adoption, transactions, and applications.
There are many emerging apps that already use Bitcoin's blockchain to store information. To dismiss these transactions as spam is wrong. They are valid use cases. We need to foster their growth as it is vital to Bitcoin's growth. 
But how can we stay decentralized while still creating ever bigger blocks? Well that is the job of engineers. They should not only be figuring out how to increase block sizes, but reducing block times too. Some blockchain will become the de facto data storage device for the world. Whichever one wins will most likely be the most valuable because the mining costs will need to offset the increased cost of storing the data. I truly hope it will be Bitcoin.

One might argue this is only occurring because the scales have been skewed more towards decentralization instead of growth. I am of the opinion that there should be a healthy equilibrium between decentralization and growth. Both should be a tenet of Bitcoin and neither should be sacrificed for the other. Stay too decentralized, stagnate. Grow too much, topple and fall. Many in this community don't realize maximums on either side of this scale are harmful to Bitcoin.

A flexible block size that runs on a exponential moving average. It would take considerably more time and resources for a rogue miner to game if nearly impossible. IMO that would be a compromise miners would be willing to go for as it gives them hope for on-chain scaling, not just a one time bump.
@_date: 2016-01-15 05:38:16
I would completely agree with you under normal circumstances, but Bitcoin is in a political battle for its survival. Lines have been drawn and its small blockers vs big blockers. I didn't even realize how bad it was until I started this thread. I had no idea of the mind set of the core developers who want to keep small blocks. I would argue that the blockchain as data storage device is one of the most important inventions since paper or the printing press. We finally have an immutable, incorruptible data source. There can be no revisionist history. No book burnings. No deleting. This data could be stored potentially forever. This is one of Bitcoin's killer apps and for the core not being able to see or want this just blows my mind. Sure we could use another blockchain to be the data storage device, but it should be Bitcoin for the same reason I don't own shitty altcoins. Bitcoin is the best. It's the most secure and the most reliable. If I wanted to trust the information to be around forever, Bitcoin's blockchain would be it. It's the same trust for owning a coin.
@_date: 2016-01-27 04:53:22

I think one of biggest issues our system has is that we have an inflationary financial system, but economic production is moving to a deflationary system. Major industries are on verge of becoming information technologies like energy, healthcare, and manufacturing. Once an industry becomes an information technology it will adhere to Law of Accelerating Returns and become deflationary. We are already seeing this with energy. Solar power is an information technology. It has steadily been doubling in watt/installed and halving in price/watt every 2 years since its introduction in the 1970's. Solar is now at 1% of the total power production, but guess what? When you are at 1% with exponential growth you are only 7 doublings from 100%. Informational technology will take over all major industries in the next 20-30 years. How will our inflationary financial system cope with all the falling prices and disruption that will occur? Something will have to give.

A better term is that it's not a fair scaling option for miners. Miners want a piece of the tx pie too and keeping the block size tiny doesn't really allow them to compete vs off-chain. A dynamically adjusting blocksize like ETH has would be fair to miners IMO. It's been around for 2 years and hasn't been gamed yet.

@_date: 2017-03-17 17:40:46
That's not indicative of the situation we find ourselves. Miners are blocking Segwit and moving towards BU because it gives them manifest destiny for on-chain tx's. Bitcoin's tx prize pool is a gigantic market and I bet some miners do not want to be relegated to just high end tx transfers. They want to complete for the whole pool. 
As far a flex block size no one can say with absolute certainty that it will lead to centralization. For example, a decentralized node could be created that eases the burden of contributing to the network. If that existed it would instantly increase Bitcoin decentralization by magnitudes. 
@_date: 2016-01-27 22:56:46
Yes they have decided. Luke jr and other Core developers have decided that transactions that store information to the blockchain are spam and abusive to the system. I completely disagree, I believe storing information in Bitcoin's blockchain is one of it's most vital and important apps.

Ah, but you been in two bubbles that have coincided? Tx fees are definitely in a bubble though most user are oblivious or indifferent to meteoric rise in tx fees because BTC price is going up. 


You are assuming miners will act rationally on the behalf of the entire Bitcoin ecosystem to upgrade scalability, however, most miners have do not have motivation to implement any scalability because of rising tx fees. A crash in the price of BTC will bring perhaps even bring in more profits as tx could exceed the block reward. If this scenario occurs I have no idea who will win scalability debate, but there will a huge swath of users hurt by the tx fee bubble who will never want it to occur again. Perhaps this is the end game Jihan WU and BU  has been planning all along. They can come in and promise dynamic scaling so a fee bubble can never occur again while wrestling control over the main implementation of Bitcoin away from Core/Blockstream.

Perhaps you are right, but it doesn't change the fact that blockchain technology still may be the best information storing device ever created. Should we not use this particular app because there is a chance some information could be lost?
I do not claim to know that Bitcoin is or what it will become. I do know that for engineers to believe certain use cases are stupid or worthless is dangerous and arrogant. The use cases should be pushing the boundaries of the software so it can evolve. I do know this though:
All information has value, especially new unique information. Since it has value we will need to store it so it is never lost. Perhaps one day all new unique information will be stored on a blockchain type system since it is a value transfer system. I don't know if Bitcoin's blockchain will be this app, but which ever blockchain does become the de facto information storage device will have enormous value. This app will require the biggest blocks. The biggest blocks require the most resources and the highest miner rewards. This is why I am so disappointed in the Core's vision of the future. I will definitely put my monetary value in the blockchain that also safeguards my information as they go hand in hand. 
@_date: 2017-03-19 05:32:46


I disagree. The more wealth that users acquire as btc value rises, the more they will pay to make sure that wealth is secure. How much would you pay a month to make sure 20, 30 or 50 million of your money was secure? BTW I will support both chains if there is any split. I am agnostic to this fight and just preparing myself for likely outcomes. I know it's sort of fucked up but part of me really wants to see a chain split just for the science.
Oh that flood attack in July was nothing. We are going to see tx fees in the next year that exceed the block reward. Users will cry bloody murder and btc will drop like a rock. Only then will this stalemate come to pass. Just be ready it will be an opportunity to add more btc to your position.

As far as dAPPs I really don't think Bitcoin will ever be in the running, however, sidechains are very interesting. The way I see the IoV unfolding is at some point there will be a dotcom moment for coins. Companies will realize having a coin will be as important as having a website as it will allow them directly interact with consumers on a financial level. A coin will become a membership card and a pseudo-stock, and eventually a way to store value making companies economic nation states. In this rush not all companies will want their own blockchain and side chains will be the easy choice. Bitcoin can become the NYSE for these coins, while ETH will be more like the NASDAQ.
@_date: 2016-06-03 17:05:18
From my understanding, sidechains allow for altcoins to be created. Basically the ICO would be an altcoin. Investors would fund the offering, this would instantly give the altcoin speculative value, just like any other altcoin/crowdfunding launch. It is no different than a normal stock IPO. Perhaps sidechains aren't the best mechanism for altcoins ICO's, maybe its Counterparty. Investors will see return just like any speculative investment based on the perceived value. The only difference is the company/DAO/DAC might incorporate bylaws that require it to buyback its native coin once it has profit or generating revenue. This would give investors for the first time in history a way to truly buy into a company's economic future.
@_date: 2016-06-04 18:05:38


Yes it does! You are not seeing the overall big picture. Even bitcoin equates to a stock issuance. With any token based cryptocurrency issuance you are buying into the app's or network's economic future same as a company stock. But unlike stocks, the price of the token is goes up the more it is used. For the first time in history we have a system where the price will eventually be determined mostly by its use, not by speculation. However, this will only come near full adoption, which is still far away. 
Now as far venture capital, Ethereum is the perfect example. A crowdfund for 18 million and now it's worth 1 billion. Investors took a chance on some young kid with a brilliant idea and it has paid off big time. Yes, it not a stock, but who wants a stock anyway? They are outdated "dumb" assets compared to "smart" token based assets. A token's features and functionality completely outstrip stocks. 
My whole idea was I thought of a way that non app/network based companies can do a cryptocurrency issuance for venture capital if the company buys back its token once it's profitable. I expect in the future this will become the standard practice for venture capital.

Everything I've read about sidechains says the will be a ways to create new coins with different features and functionality for testing or proving grounds. Either way it's irrelevant, the main point being we have found a faster, more efficient way to fund venture capital that is open to all. The DAO is a prime example how this can be done. $150 million in crowdfunding in less than 30 days. Stocks are going the way of the landline as token based venture capital offers so much more functionality compared stocks and this is just the beginning. I can't even imagine all the features and functionality that will be developed for startups and investors.

You don't understand what I am trying to say. We own "equity" in Bitcoin's future economic activity (And yes, I used quotes around equity).

It's faster, more fluid, transparent, and programmable. It's a smart asset compared to dumb asset like a stock with limited features and capabilities. And yes, all the venture capital spent on btc has done a lot for the ecosystem, development, and most importantly the security of the network.
This trend in crypto venture capital is moving fast and getting more refined. Ethereum, Factom, now the DAO. What I am saying that this will eventually move to non network or non app companies as its a better way to fund venture capital. It's a smart phone vs a land line. No comparison.

It would work something like this. A startup would do an ICO (initial coin offering) after the coin would be traded and have liquidity. They would use the funds from the offering to fund its operations, however at some point once they started generating revenue they would begin to buy back their native coin. There is no equity, there is no stock. Just crypto, simple and elegant.

You are living in past, letting your hate for "altcoins" blind you of the forest and see only trees. Cryptocurrencies are a faster and more efficient form of venture capital. They are open to all democratizing entrepreneurship and investing by lowering the barrier of entry for both parties. Technologically, coins are better than stocks in functionality, there is no comparison. The most beautiful aspect of this new form of venture capital that you gloss over is that the coins value can be derived from its use on the network or app. I would argue this is a much better way of valuation compared how stocks are. We are in the early stages of the VC revolution and Bitcoin (with side chains) will be the NYSE and Ethereum will be the Nasdaq. 
We do need standards developed for ICO's to prevent fraud. The neat part is that it can all be done with code and basically automate SEC regulations. A good place to start would perhaps be lock founder coins like IPO's do.

Jorge you are obviously intelligent. I urge you just to sit down one day and not think about the Bitcoin as currency, but as a way to move value around as easily as bits of information move around the Internet. How that value can interact with each other all and all the wonderful applications that become available. How it will help disrupt some of the most vile businesses that take advantage of the poorest people. 
For example, in a fully adopted cryptocurrency world a vile businesses like payday loans would disappear as the user and a loaning agent could set up a smart contract that gives his/her next salary payment to the the loaning agent for immediate money. Instead of taking an outrageous percentage like the do now, the price would be near zero. In fact, most lending would go near zero as users could setup smart contracts that use digital assets as collateral. The friction being removed and the speed at which value moves would spur the world economy. There are so many wonderful possibilities I can't fathom why someone of your intelligence would be against such a technology. We could really use your help making the world a better place.

Exactly this, it's very easy for miners to collude to make tx's more profitable since block are already so full. It's easy to game the market. All you do is find the absolute lowest bound tx price on the bubble to make it into a block. The you keep spamming transactions on those lower bound transactions pushing the lower bound higher and higher, then profit. Bitcoin users have no alternative to send a tx and have to pay a higher fee. 
Would the Chinese do this? Nah it's not like the Chinese ever have any shady business practices. It's not like tx prices have gone exponential in the past 8 months. /s

I think miners will soon realize if they move hashrate from BTC for BCH in unison and uniformly that can still collect "extra" block rewards from BTC in the form of transaction fees from the congestion. The game then becomes how to trigger the smallest difficulty adjustments in BTC as possible to keep this profit motive going. Miners might sell a smaller portion of BCH to keep the price afloat to continue this game as long as possible.

Most of the time though we are just arguing between ourselves how to scale these networks in the best possible way. 
@_date: 2016-11-26 20:34:08


Yes but see that could be worked around. The user's account could be permissioned that users next payment gets sent to the loaner agent not just a check that bounces at the end of the week. See this is the beautiful part of cryptocurrency is that it can be programmed in infinite ways compared to analog value.


You should really try to imagine what a full adopted cryptocurrency world would look like. How value will flow around the world without friction. It reality cryptocurrency is just a way to create, store, and transport digital value. It will really be no different that what the Internet did for information except for value.

@_date: 2016-11-28 01:29:50
We are getting a little off track and you are completely ignoring the notion of how value can interact directly on a digital level on blockchains. Let me give you an example how digital value interactions could be used in the future to mitigate risk for loaning agents.
In the near future digital assets will be held in blockchains. These assets can be anything of digital value but for this example lets say its a digitally rare song. Let's say you bought a 1 in 500 limited digital release of Taylor Swift's first blockchain based album. The first 500 were pre release collector edition. There is no way this version of the song could be counterfeited as it would be as difficult as counterfeiting a bitcoin. Some people find these special edition songs very valuable and it has quite a bit of value.
However, times are not good you lost your job you need a new suit for a job interview. You decide to take out a small loan digital loan, but to your surprise you see that if you put collateral the cost of the loan goes near zero. Now you love Taylor Swift, I mean you are her biggest fan and would never think about selling this song but you decide to put it as collateral know you have some extra income coming in next week as severance just in case. You take out the loan, put the song in a contract that specifies if the loan is not repaid the collateral is sold off. However, the collateral far exceeds the price of loan so in the case that it is sold off at a decentralized exchange the excess is returned to you. This all could be easy done with blockchains and smart contracts.
In this example we are using the user is using digital collateral to lower lending costs. The loaning agent is taking less risk which lowers costs. Also, the user would be getting full value of its collateral just in case the loan is defaulted on. Compare this to how pawn shops work and you start to see how blockchains will make the world more efficient. We didn't even start on ease of use, how this could be done in an app with no signup and executed in minutes. This is just simple example of how digital value can interact on blockchains.  Like I said before blockchains will enable digital value to be created, stored, transported, and interacted with as easily as bits of information are on the Internet. How can you not just fall in love with this idea?
@_date: 2017-01-08 15:14:45
Don't listen to the Bitcoin fanboys. Ethereum is an important project. Bitcoin is like digital gold, Ethereum is trying to build a decentralized computer.

High end doesn't matter. Even low end users grow at ~50% it's just that they lag by a few years. Eventually low end users will get the same technology as high end users. The data set Rusty was using just wasn't long enough to get the real trend. As new paradigms (baud modems, isdn, cable, fiber, etc) emerge bandwidth speeds spike dramatically so picking a dataset before a spike can really skew the numbers. 
@_date: 2016-11-26 19:56:07


I didn't say it would free, I said it go near zero, that is a big difference. Risk **would** be reduced lowering costs of lending drastically. Of course, risk assessment would still be part of the process. As far as the smart contract, the user could enter the destination of the next payment into a smart contract that would give access to loaning agent at the end of work week, etc. The loaning agent could also get access to the users work history with the user's permission for instant risk assessment. 
I still don't understand how you don't see the potential of this technology for a world of good. What is your biggest issue with cryptocurrency in general?

What motivation do miners have to activate segwit? Tx fees are pouring in, they are making money hand over fist. A shock needs to occur in the form of a fee event that causes Bitcoin price to drop dramatically before anything happens. 
My prediction: Fees continue to climb exponentially, then unrest and panic occurs in the markets, fees bubble to inconceivable levels and then Bitcoin price crashes. At that point something will get done, segwit get activated or a hardfork to BU. BU hardfork will occur if the Core leadership is held responsible for the fee event occurring since they wanted the fee market in the first place. 
Of course the politics are already in play, as viaBTC and will be blamed too. Really though it was the inaction of the entire community that will cause this fee event. You cannot blame miners for wanting to make extra money and boy will they make a shitload.

The problem is the more blocks become full the easier and less majority you need to pull off the gaming. The more transactions that never make it into blocks make it much easier as you can push the lower bound higher and higher. If I were trying to attack the network I would try to maximize my spam txs to be as high cost as possible and NOT make it into blocks ever. This would push the lower bound tx costs higher and cost me very little as hopefully most would never make it into any blocks. 
@_date: 2016-11-20 08:24:44
I don't like the idea stocks on top of cryptocurrencies. To me it's like trying to send a fax on the Internet. I think it's a much more elegant solution for companies just to do an ICO. I predict ICO's will become the standard for new network and DApps and then later traditional companies join the bandwagon will issue ICO's. These companies will convert any sales into their native currency. It will be like every company becoming its own nation state. Want to buy into the economic future of a company? Just buy their currency. 
I envision Bitcoin becoming the new NYSE where there are millions upon millions of sidechain currencies, not just for companies but organizations like churches, charities, and perhaps even individuals.

What I'm saying is 17% is way too conservative. Even if we have spikes the average growth is still ~50% per year. Being too conservative also has negative consequences so it's not a free ride.


True visionaries understand that information technologies have been expanding exponentially. Steve Jobs knew that a handheld computer was not ready in the early 2000's unlike Microsoft's Tablet PC. Jobs knew that it had to be small enough and the battery had to last most of the day to be truly adopted. If you know the exponentially nature of information technology could start product development years before you know that certain components will get smaller and more powerful. For instance say you wanted to make the next Google Glass (they were too early too). You could estimate the the trend of battery size and power to fit the constraints of normal size glasses that could last all day. It also goes for software. YouTube founders understood that storage and bandwidth would get much much cheaper and eventually their business model would be profitable. It really important to know these trends and allow the user base to grow. If competitors plan for these trends and you do not, you will be at a huge disadvantage.

In case of miners that are barely profitable would they be willing to risk their business on a guaranteed drop in revenue? Some miners might even see the opportunity that Bitcoin users are trapped and fees could get much much higher. Those of shady moral character might try to cause another fee event, ready to short the market once unrest and chaos begins. I will really be surprised if Segwit gets activated without lowering the threshold.

The currency aspect of Bitcoin is the least interesting thing about it. Bitcoin's true potential comes from inventing digital scarcity so things of digital value can created, stored, and transferred. It's like the Internet but instead of information being created and stored its digital value. All this digital value will be able interact directly with each other creating unimaginable apps. An example would be like getting an instant low cost loan because you can use your digital song collection as collateral.

I disagree, miners have us by the balls. There is no reason to upgrade until a shock happens to the price of Bitcoin. Until then tx fees will continue to rise until they bubble and something breaks. Transaction fees will temporarily go to irrational levels possibly like $5-10 and miners will be laughing all the way to bank.

Sure. It could be something like a private key and hashed file or even encrypted on decentralized storage that also be stored locally. Of course music can still be duplicated, what I am talking about is digital rarity which Bitcoin has invented and allows for timestamped and numbered collector items. People choose to buy music from iTunes because of the convenience or like to collect. This would be no different except much cheaper since artist would take a greater profit. Artists would be in total control of their content as they would be the central distribution point. Access to their content could work like an API. For example, they could create special licensing smart contract system that paid them when the song was used and set their own pricing. The artist would know every time their song was played and get paid for it instead of other systems counting (like Radio or Pandora) and then sending payment. Many artists have claimed these companies are cheating them. Above is an example how blockchain technology can empower users and democratize distribution and content creation.As far as copying and trying to sell it, it would be an illegal copy and have no value. Counterfeits could easy be detected. 


In my example I was speaking about a really short term loan, but you are correct. I should rephrase and just say nearer to zero or cheaper compared traditional lending (in most cases).


So do you agree that that blockchain technology would make this certain use case to lending cheaper? I get from the dig about "Wonderful World of Blockchain" that you don't enjoy losing this argument. 
Jorge, you are a smart person. I am too with you that I abhor the libertarian fringe that think Bitcoin will eventually replace the dollar when there is an economic collapse. This libertarian fringe wet dream is just that a fantasy. Eventually they move to some other fringe and complain how Bitcoin was taken over and not the same any more.

You are missing the big picture. It's all about the potential ease of use cases that make programmable money a game changer.
Imagine this scenario that is likely to occur in the near future. You walk into a retail store, scan a product and pay for it using a cryptocurrency. It may seem like a normal purchase but many things can occur instantly without the user even having to interact. Things like:
* Ownership is transferred to you on a blockchain. When the ownership feature in enabled on this widget you are the only one to turn it on. 
* You get an instant rebate from the manufacturer of the product for releasing the sales information (price, data, geographical location, etc). You are also automatically registered for a warranty. This will make supply chains more efficient as real time data comes in. 
* You keep a digital receipt that be looked up searching your wallet or by even scanning the product. How many times have you had the product but not the receipt? 
This plus thousands of other ease of use cases could be developed for purchases. Bitcoin is not just ideal money, it's the most innovative programmable money ever created. All these ease of use cases will make users want to pay in cryptocurrency as it will make everything easier. To say paying with cryptocurrency doesn't solve anything is missing the whole concept of programmable money.

I was always against QE but then I came to a  relevation the other day. The Fed got a hell of a deal in buying all those risky assets. The Fed is making money hand over fist from buying those assets and all the interest goes back to the Treasury. By being the back stop and preventing more defaults they basically came in like Buffet and bought up a bunch of cheap assets and now are receiving the dividends. Of course this house of cards is all dependent that we don't we have another financial crisis which makes those assets worthless. If, however, they can start selling these assets back to market they will make a major profit. This is why the Fed is concerned about keeping the markets inflated, they don't want any deflation before they can unload those assets.

Do you ever wonder how a $30 a month Internet connection gives you access to entire collection of human knowledge? Or an endless library of entertainment? Or why there are $30 smart phones that added another billion minds to the Internet. It's the exponential growth of computing power that makes all information technologies deflationary.

I agree the usage of these apps is low otherwise blocks would be already full past capacity. It's more about the vision of Bitcoin and overall philosophy. Do we want to foster these apps by providing fertile land for these apps to develop? Will developers wait until side chains are released or just switch to Ethereum because there is no clear path to scalability in blocksize? Is the Core willing to lose these network effects to Ethereum?
My answer is that Bitcoin needs every single use case and app it can get. Let these apps have room to grow and if they choose to use side chains in the future because it's economical they will. The only reason any of these apps choose to use Bitcoin over Ethereum is because Bitcoin's first mover advantage that gives added branding, users, and blockchain stability, not because it's a easier platform to develop on at this point.

So does SegWit make make miners who run it make them more profitable than miners who don't? If so, then my whole argument is null and void. 


Wait are discussing the same thing? I was speaking about the overall capacity of the network if a fee even caused a crash in BTC. Then the miners would be motivated to upgrade software to increase network capacity as most likely the block rewards would still be more important than fee revenue. 


That is a big if. I am actually concerned that miners could collude to create even smaller blocks to create even more fee pressure as this is how boom/bust events occur when greed trumps rationality. There is an exploitable resource in bitcoin HODLers.

So it's not possible a miner decides to mine multiple chains while keeping a complete unpruned record and selling aggregated data for faster access? If this expanded profit margins wouldn't they potentially more profitable than other miners? I think it's very likely a search engine type business like Google will emerge out a mining company. They will want to index every bit of information broadcasted on blockchains. I'm keeping my eye out for this because I want to invest in it.

A point many economists and central bankers don't understand is the deflationary effect of information technology. When industries become information technologies they experience exponential price/performance deflation. A perfect example is energy, which currently at a tipping point in which it is going to be overtaken by information technology. Solar power is an information technology and has steadily been doubling in watts/installed and halving in price/watt since PV's introduction in the 1970's. Currently solar's output is 1% of the total world energy, but that means its only 7 doublings from 100%. This is just one of many industries information technology will consume. Finance, healthcare, manufacturing, construction are all ripe for disruption. What happens to the manufacturing industry when consumers can print almost anything in minutes at home for almost a zero cost?

Any application that intends to the use the blockchain to store information, like time stamping, messaging, or notary. These apps could be the beginning of really huge network effects. I think the messaging/time stamping app will eventually be one of the blockchain's killer apps. Knowing who was the first person to say something has value, a lot of value. The blockchain would give concrete proof who said what first. It would also allow it to be like a decentralized twitter with unstoppable, un-deletable, un-censorable messages. Now if you were planning to build this app, would you choose Bitcoin's blockchain? I don't think so since there because the Core's vision doesn't make it feasible. They don't see the blockchain as a information storage device. If these apps do become successful their network effects will cascade down with all the data created. This is the kind of network effects Bitcoin could potentially miss out on plus all the other apps that want to use Bitcoin's blockchain to store information. 
It's sort of like Bitcoin is a computer, but the Core is not deciding to upgrade it's disk drive. Developers will flock to other computers, ahem Ethereum, to build their apps.

The price of BTC should not effect the transaction cost. The transaction cost should be determined by cost or processing and storing transactions (if market caused miners to compete for those transactions). Considering all the technologies related doing this get exponentially cheaper, the price of transactions should stay flat even if transactions grow exponentially too.

You are seeing trees but not the forest. Blockchains are value storage devices that allow direct programmatic interactions. These blockchains will interconnect making the Internet of Value. Bitcoin is an important app, safe and secure digital gold, but it seems unlikely in will be the all in one Internet of Value when bits of value will be flying around like bit of data on the Internet. Bitcoin is just too slow innovation wise, but like I said that is a good thing. We need a safe and secure reserve currency for the Internet of Value.

We all want the Internet of Money. Having a rock solid decentralized Core is essential and I agree with that, you and the Core have fully convinced me off that now. However, I still have reservations about the current artificial cap on transactions trying to price out non-financial transactions or how calls them, spam. 
I see something totally different. I see beautiful flora growing, not weeds that need to be plucked. This flora has a symbiotic relationship with Bitcoin and is essential for the growth of Bitcoin's ecosystem. Why not give this flora room to grow and when sidechains come out they will have plenty of room to flourish? Eventually these apps will find it more economical to reside on sidechains, in the mean time why not grow these seeds so they can be transplanted? 
The Core developers need to understand that every app that does succeed will have exponential networks effects and shape how big Bitcoin grows in the future. It's tantamount that we foster these apps AND build the Core.
@_date: 2016-02-15 08:41:33
With "training wheels" on it is possible Bitcoin may be missing critical network effects to sustain it's exponential growth and just plateau early on the s-curve. If this occurs a competitor will most likely use Bitcoin as a stepping stone to continue its exponential growth on the s-curve until this particular technology reaches a saturation point. A perfect example of this is Myspace vs FB for social networks. Myspace was missing some critical network effect to reach full adoption, FB had all elements.
In any case at 1% adoption it should be 7 doublings to get 100%, not necessarily 7 years. It all depends how long it takes to double.

That would only matter if the amount of nodes was growing exponentially and the nodes needed to share transaction fees to survive. This would cause the price of transactions to grow ~~linearly~~ exponentially, but that is not the case as the number of nodes is declining. You see, the price/performance of technology gains are also exponential so they would most likely cancel each other out, though bandwidth is a little slower in its doubling than the other technologies. However, it seems like the number of Bitcoin transactions is also a slower exponential than CPU and storage.

This is the Core's main problem with Bitcoin's long term vision. All these apps that use the blockchain are critical network effects, without them Bitcoin will struggle to reach mass adoption and be leapfrogged by another blockchain that foster these apps. The view that these apps will only be niche is staggeringly short sighted. They could turn into the next Google or Twitter. Every use case of the blockchain should be celebrated. 
Stop being the over protective parent, Bitcoin needs as many friends as it can have. Driving them away to other blockchains only increases the chances that Bitcoin's s-curve adoption rate will plateau early before cryptocurrency hits is saturation point.

Time will only tell whether the Core's conservative outlook on the block size limit is right. No one really knows what Bitcoin is or what it will become at this point. I for one had thought for years the block size limit would just grow exponentially because I saw the blockchain as information storage device. Perhaps, in time, it will seem silly to store non essential information to the blockchain, just like you wouldn't store data in a CPU. Will Bitcoin Core turn into the CPU of some giant decentralized computer? Maybe. I do know storing information to a blockchain will be an essential app in the future and which ever blockchain captures this market should be one of the most valuable. I hedged into Ethereum well before this civil war started because I loved the thought of a decentralized computer. This whole block size debate has shaken my faith in Bitcoin a bit, but I'm no where close to selling but I sleep better at night because I'm hedged.

Honestly, even Bitcoin side chains could do everything you said WITHOUT loss of development power, Bitcoin would only still take a small part of DAPP market. What motivation do DAPP developers have to leave the Ethereum community and join Bitcoin's IF/WHEN side chains are released? I think you don't understand the ETH community, just like Bitcoin they are trying to build something beautiful, but its a decentralized development platform not a decentralized currency. Like I said Ethereum will do the work, Bitcoin will store the value. 
@_date: 2016-09-08 16:58:29
That's fallacy IMO, the other blockchain has already shown its more developer friendly and more catering to the users/developers will. It has a large lead in DAPP development because it 10x times easier to develop on. Bitcoin moves very slow, but that is perfectly fine because it should if it's core is going to be digital gold. Ethereum's very goal is to be the system of economic activity for the crypto world, not a store of value, I really don't see how Bitcoin can compete with that. There are so many huge markets and I don't think one blockchain can capture them all. I think it's much more plausible that we have many blockchains capturing different markets. The good thing is that once this value is created it still can be transferred and exchanged between blockchains, so it really doesn't matter if one blockchain contains all the value. 
@_date: 2016-09-09 16:16:20
Having different blockchains with different ideologies creates a more diverse ecosystem of cryptocurrencies which helps with mass adoption. We can see from the ETH/ETC split ideology played a big part. These ideologies will shape and grow these cryptocurrencies in different ways with completely different capabilities and functionality. ETH put its users first, something Bitcoin would probably never do if it sacrificed safety. Another example is the work is being done on the actual main protocol. Bitcoin is taking a very safe approach, ETH is taking cutting edge techniques no where near as safe. The ideologies are different, one is a store of a value, one is a development platform. 
While it's true the technology can be replicated, the community and first mover advantage cannot. ETH has such a huge lead in DAPP development and Rootstock is not even out yet. ETH has a GUI in Mist and when it's app store comes out it just game over IMO. I just think it flawed thinking the whole one chain to rule them all. One chain does not equate to the Internet analogy, since the value can be exchanged between blockchains and they can work together. I prefer to think of these separate blockchains more like emerging tech titans like Google, FB, or Amazon.

I'm going to get downvoted to hell, but I see the two major blockchains being used for completely different types of applications. Bitcoin is ultra conservative and safe. It's core will seem as good as gold when it comes to safety. What do you do with the safest blockchain? Well you store things that are valuable on it. Bitcoin's blockchain will take the lion's share of the digital asset/store of value applications with its 2nd layers. The other blockchain will be the one that moves fast so developers can build decentralized 2.0 applications, like resource sharing and machine to machine exchanges. One will be like total wealth of assets, the other like GDP creating the value all the time. 
It's important not to hate the other blockchain as its crucial for adoption. We need those DAPPs that allow users to accumulate coins through economic activity. Once enough users get enough wealth they will start using those coins and it will cause cascading network effects. So please don't hate on Coinbase because they see it too.

Because the blockchains will have different capabilities and side chains will have to interact with them, therefore they will be different. Side chains also add layers of complexity compared to directly just interacting with the main chain. 


Why build a DAPP on Bitcoin if its harder to program AND you have to create your own token anyway? ETH is the first mover in this space and moving faster than Bitcoin. The whole platform is dedicated to building these apps, not just some side chain. The community for DAPP development is pretty entrenched already and we are talking about Bitcoin completing with technology that doesn't even exist yet? Seems improbable to me. 
It may seem like a cleaner solution to have a single blockchain paradigm, but that is not what is happening. We will have public and private chains. The diversity and competition is good for the entire ecosystem. There are no way these communities are fading away, if any thing ETH and Monero are getting stronger.

Ok even forget that argument, you missing even the bigger picture. I support the ETH because I believe in the project and the people behind it. They have done amazing work in the field of cryptocurrency. Vitalik Buterin even won an World Technology Network award. It's no Nobel, but its pretty prestigious especially for a 19 year old. 
None of this development would have gotten done if there were was no support. Anything that is public use, must be crowdfunded. Ethereum is an open use platform. Money for development would of never come from a VC firm. 
Here is the salient point though: Is Bitcoin better because Ethereum exists? In my opinion it is a resounding, YES! Even if Bitcoin gobbles up ETH and starts to using some of its technology, that means Bitcoin is better. Will Bitcoin be better in the future because of ETH? That is also a yes. They already learned the lesson of the DAO through ETH. The smart contract languages they have developed will also be used. This is amazing work, Vitalik is a machine. 
Anyway, I would never pull out of this project because I love it's vision. They want to be the world's first unplug-able computer. It just gives me goose bumps thinking about it. To me this project is way too important to give up on it, so even if I thought its blockchain might fail I still wouldn't sell.

All that is needed is "wallets" compatible with crypto digital goods which could easily be done once the blockchains are up and running. I believe this is one of the problems Colu is trying to solve. There is over 100 billion in digital goods locked in centralized platforms like Amazon, iTunes, etc. It would be awesome for consumers if we could trade these goods as easily as bitcoins. At the rate that the digital goods market is growing do we really want a trillion dollars of real wealth not accessible to the owners? This is real wealth that users could resell or use as collateral with crypto finance. Imagine getting a loan based on a user's digital goods portfolio. If the user defaulted on the loan, the crypto goods could be automatically sent to the loaner.

Allowing digital rarity will have broad implications in the future. One day we might have very rare collector edition songs, ebooks, or video games.

Right now it's impossible to trade digital goods since they are store on centralized systems. There is no incentive for these systems allow buy/selling between users.

It's appcoins not Bitcoin that will be catalyst for massive adoption. Bitcoin is just money, its a great app, but not one that will cause massive adoption. When new DApps start to appear that allow users to earn money for things like sharing computational resources or allow them full ownership and publishing rights for content, users will generate wealth with these appcoins. Eventually these users will stop trading this wealth for fiat because it will be more convenient to keep this wealth in the cryptocurrency realm to buy and use other services. Network effects will cascade, massive adoption occurs.
This is one reason why I find all the Ethereum hate on unproductive. Ethereum is Bitcoin's greatest hope of a massively adopted cryptocurrency world. It has a great pipeline of DApps that will generate new users and wealth for adoption.

I don't think you are seeing the value in the rarity aspect. It's just like having an authentic first edition of a book. Collectors would know if the digital object was truly one of the first created, not copied.

This is the game changer. It's not just about currency, it's about value. One day Bitcoin will allow the creation, storage, and transportation of almost anything with digital value. We are rapidly moving to a digital world and transmitting value, ANY VALUE, with a low friction network is direly needed.

It always irks me when I see such blanket assumptions that bigger blocks automatically lead to runaway centralization.

The Core's vision is slow and steady. To create the perfect "Core" of the Internet of Money. If the core of Bitcoin is maximally decentralized all the layers built on top of it will work better.

Content and information have value. Currently Google gets all this information for free by having spiders crawl websites. Balaji is saying at some point the tide will reverse and Google and other search engines will have to pay if they want this information. 
Google is already taking content and answering users' queries without user needing to go to the actual website. This is really bad for website owners because ad based revenue models get less views. Balaji is right, this tide will eventually turn.

The decentralization/centralization process is the natural evolutionary order of the universe. Centralization is necessary for growth and to evolve into a higher form of complexity. Starting with the Big Bang, atoms in the universe were at maximum centralization and then they were decentralized. The atoms began to centralize and form stars which until they exploded creating a higher form of complexity which allowed for planets, etc. We see this process occur over and over again whether its atoms, molecules, societies, or governments. Centralize a ruling class's power too far and society rebels and forms a higher complexity of governing. Stay too decentralized, wallow and stagnate with not enough growth like Native American tribes and get absorbed by a higher complexity as a resource. 
How does Bitcoin walk this thin line of decentralization vs centralization to ensure its maximum lifespan? Some healthy equilibrium between decentralization and centralization is the likely path. Maximums of decentralization or centralization will lead an unfavorable outcome for this project.

Listen. You do not see the big picture. We have found a way to create, store, and transport value as easily as bits of information on the Internet. It's the Internet of Value. If you cannot see the future applications that can be built with this technology it's really OK. Move along.

Core developers seem not to have an understanding of the exponential nature of information technology. Somehow they believe that Internet bandwidth only grows ~17% per year even though the data shows we got from 14.4k baud modems to 1Gb in home connections in 25 years. (which is ~50% growth rate)

As blocks become more full, it becomes easier and easier to attack the network. All you have to do is find the the lower bound price to not be ever included in a block and spam tx's. You can basically bid up tx fee prices without much risk.

@_date: 2017-05-15 04:54:52


I see something completely different. I see blockchains simply as a way to create, store, and directly interact with digital value. An analogy I use is that blockchains are value storage devices just like hard drives. Transferring value between these blockchains will become more and more trivial in the future. Eventually these blockchains will interconnect and the Internet of Value will emerge. This is when the fun stuff begins to happen. Exciting, unfathomable apps will spawn making consumers lives easier adding features to money and digital value that are impossible now. 
However, mass adoption will not occur from the currency app. What we need is users acquiring and storing wealth in blockchains. Ethereum and other alts are Bitcoin's best friend in this fight as dAPPs will allow users to create wealth through economic utility. Once enough users acquire wealth in crypto they will find it more convenient use crypto instead of cashing out. Then network effects cascade and mass adoption occurs.

I think PoS is part of Vitalik's master plan. Seems smart to have a GUI to Ethereum in Mist that not only is node but a way to access the computational resources of computers around the world. If you are going to build a decentralized computer PoW is not the way to do it, its PoS or bust.
@_date: 2016-10-13 22:22:16

Blockchain technology is a much simpler and elegant solution. Why use PKE for something like that? I mean you are already there purchasing something why not tie your identity to it and have immutable proof from a blockchain? While you are at it might as well give real time sales data to manufacturer. It's not that hard, every product just needs a unique identifier like a QR code.
@_date: 2017-05-30 23:50:26


The fact there is a non zero cost makes this sort of attack unsustainable if blocks were not full. Attacker(s) will eventually run out of resources unless there is a self sustaining profit motive. Scaring users into alts because of high fees or other tactics would be very difficult to pull off because of natural market gyrations.

I don't think you do. If an asset is created and paid for, whatever crypto currency is used to pay for it expands that market cap. Now you can argue the creator of the may cash out in fiat, but I don't think it will be a 100% leak. 
@_date: 2015-03-07 19:26:08
There doesn't need to be a financial crisis for bitcoin to rise. Apps and assets that increase the functionality of bitcoin and it's ecosystem could expand the market cap. For example say crowdfunding for crypto-equities takes off, the float for each companies' IPO will be added to bitcoin's market cap. Just imagine if the next Uber or FB was added to bitcoin's market cap. Whether it's digital goods, smart contracts, or thousands of possible other apps users might be buying bitcoin without even wanting to just because they want to use an app or want the underlying asset.
@_date: 2015-10-14 04:51:23
I think Etheruem's model is the future of venture capital. Why buy a stock when you can buy a token in a in a DAPP, DAO, or DAC? A stock is dumb with no utility other than resell. A token can actually have utility in a system. The future value of the token is based on the amount of users in the DAPP. We are witnessing the evolution of venture capital but most don't see it yet.

I so glad others realize this and it applies to so many other possible apps not just currency. I see digital goods like ebooks, songs, or video games having true collector editions.

Bitcoin could be the NYSE for cryptocurrencies as it would be seen as the safest way to create a coin.
@_date: 2017-05-08 04:54:11
The reason Bitcoin price is so high is because some of us see much more in it than just a currency. A different way to look at it is that blockchains are digital value storage devices in the same way hard drives store information. It allows ways to directly interact and program digital value in ways we cannot comprehend. No one knows what applications will emerge, but it will make creating, transferring, storing, and programming digital value much easier. What are things with digital value? It could be anything a currency, a song, an event ticket, or even ownership to a physical object. When all these different blockchains like Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc interconnect we will have the Internet of Value. At some point most things that have digital value will be created on blockchains as it makes interacting with digital value much more feature rich. So yes, Bitcoin and its ilk will make your life much more easier in the future, but of course before that happens cryptocurrency must be widely adopted.

It could be a game changer in how much theft occurs in the world. Lost and found would be a snap. 
Other stuff huge stuff is supply chains. When manufacturers  could get instant data on where/when/how much a product was sold for.  The realtime data of sales would greatly increase efficiency.

2) Sure a centralized software system could do the same thing if everyone adopted it, but its akin to developing a specialized software for video conferencing that went out of its way not to run over the Internet.

They have been saying that every year for the past 30 years. Moore's Law may end one day but a new paradigm will emerge and the exponential growth continues. Before the integrated circuit, there was  vacuum tubes and transistors based computers. We will move on to something else like carbon or quantum. Those with foresight account for exponential grow and the deflationary cost nature of information technology. Noobs like you would've never thought things like FB or YouTube could ever be profitable free services because at the time it was data and bandwidth was expensive. You must account for the exponential nature of information technology because if you don't someone else will and they will be much further ahead in the game.

Price is a function of supply/demand. If assets/apps increase demand I would expect price to go up. However, one could argue that velocity may increase so much that the market cap would not have to expand to accommodate the value passing through, though I don't think that will be the case.

Alts follow Bitcoin. Just think of it this way. The first alt coin wave was do to many Bitcoiners getting the black so they diversified into alts as a hedge or just because they like a certain altcoin technology. Now Bitcoin is leading again so altcoin share will decrease until Bitcoiners will have even more spare money to throw at alts again once their price has sunken. Alts will go down temporarily but as long as Bitcoin keeps chuggin alts will likely have one more wave up to new all time highs also.

I don't understand the thought process how lets say 50% full blocks are easier to attack than full completely blocks. To continue a sustained attack to spam non full blocks you have to pay a real cost. The tx is guaranteed to go through. With almost full blocks you can spam lower bound cost of tx's to be included in a block and potentially not get included into a block, at zero cost. This crowds the entry point to be included into a block raising the overall tx's costs. This will only work, however, if there is always a constant backlog.

I really don't understand the hate of ICO's. Bitcoin was basically the first crowdfunded network. What we are witnessing is a revolution is venture capital. For the first time in history, users and communities are rewarded for being early adopters. In features and functionality, cryptos outstrip outdated stocks in every way. Imagine if the first users of FB, Google, or Twitter accumulated shares for using the respective platform. ICO's democratize entrepreneurship and investing. It is a thing to be proud of and not mock or ridicule. Yes, there are edge cases where some investors may get scammed, but that is the case for any startup. Hopefully one day Bitcoin will have ICO's as a side chain coins also.

See this is the issue with extremists. Sacrificing a little bit of decentralization for growth is healthy for the overall system. Growth should be on an equal footing with decentralization, neither should be sacrificed for the other. We need a healthy equilibrium between both. Right now it is too heavy skewed towards decentralization. The unwillingness to compromise will make it a fringe technology for those hardline ideals as other cryptos will adapt faster to market demands.


I'm sorry I'm not afraid of government boogeymen, it's just your wild libertarian fantasy. If Bitcoin was allowed to grow, it would become such an integral and important part of society like the Internet so government could never even fathom to attempt to take it down, nor would they be able to if they tried. We have many that will always fight for decentralization and Bitcoin's decentralization is no where near being threatened.

Not sure, but maybe accepting BIP 141 plus HF was back to square one of the HK agreement which is kind of embarrassing in itself. Perhaps segwit2x has enough changes that it considered a totally new agreement in which they can save face.

I am not after currency, that is your myopic thinking. What I want is the Internet of Value. I want a day when most of all digital value is created, stored, and directly interacted on a programmatic level with blockchains. The only way to achieve this is through mass adoption of users, just like the Internet. We need users acquiring crypto wealth through economic utility from blockchain technology. Once we have enough users, boom, network effects cascade and digital value will be more feature rich and have many more ease of use cases that is currently not possible with centralized systems.
Bitcoin currently has no economic utility other than a store of value (digital gold). It's first economic utility use cases don't exists anymore (remittance, cheap tx's) because of decentralization extremists. This is why I support other blockchain technologies such as Ethereum because they are trying to develop economic utility via dAPPs. Say what you want that ICO's are scam's or shitcoins, but in reality software is being built from venture capital. Not alls dAPPs will be a success, but some may be and it will only help with adoption. For a long time I always thought Bitcoin would be the Internet of Value, but because of the politics in play it just moves too slow, which is good for gold but the not Internet of Value. Though, Bitcoin may end up of being the reserve currency for this Internet of Value which why I still hold some.

saving face is very important in the Chinese culture, something many Westerners don't really get.

Hitch hiking has been deemed illegal in the Republic of Bitcoin.

Just waiting for the day someone can create an un-spoofable gps. It would be like having a treasure map to your coins. You must have the key and be standing in the right location.

They have to be convinced it's the new paradigm, we already know it is. That is when the bubble pops.

You got to admit you walked into that one. One should never say they are ready for weiners. Take the life lesson and move on :)

Wow you have put a lot of thought and effort into weinermetrics! You must of put in some long hours working on penises. I understand now why you are so excited for it's release, in more ways than one! I wish you all the luck in the cumming years!

Western cultures have no idea about saving face. It would of been a humiliation to activate Segwit with those jokes of a HF. Luke's was a putting salt in the wound. It was like the HF was an afterthought for the Core devs, it was not on equal ground. So yes they have a reason to not activate Segwit. Save face and make a profit is doubly good.

I'm curious, on a scale to 1 to 100, where would you put your libertarian political beliefs? IMO, if Bitcoin is being run and controlled by libertarians it's potential market share should be around 10% of the overall crypto market. It is an extremist view if you hold fast to those libertarian ideals and never compromise-- the overall market share will be representative of that. For years I thought Bitcoin would grow up and shed most of the libertarian hard lines, but if UASF gets activated it just will solidify my opinion. In time I will move most of crypto portfolio away from Bitcoin as these hard lines will drive away user adoption making it just simply digital gold, which is a useful app but not one that will grow as fast as other crypto apps.

How could BTC more analog than dollars? BTC was born in digital. It has source code. There is programmable functionality in every single BTC. It can only exist in digital.

I would argue government currencies are analog but have a digital representation. BTC is true digital.

My mom has been trying to buy a couple bitcoins since around $350 but transfer of funds was too slow. It shot up to $600+ and I told her to put in an order for $325. It never came down so I felt bad and so I gifted her 5 of my stash.
