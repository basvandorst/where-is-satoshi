Time is the biggest luxury of all.  If the money is moved to a stock/bond portfolio and is held for over a year the taxes go from income to capital gains.  Current capitals gains rates in the USA are currently 15%, so only 9k out of 60k goes to the tax man.  If you go to a low cost of living city you can stretch that pretty damn far.  There is actually an entire sub for people trying to save up to do this and retire early.  @_date: 2017-08-27 01:06:56
Where would one look to find these repos for both Bitcoin and bash? I'd like to verify this. Thanks.

I tried googling the bcash repository and couldn't find it.  Maybe I'm trying the wrong search terms

I think we need both on and off chain scaling.  We have two weapons to attack this problem with, why not use both?  I think that the NYA was some shady backroom shit so I'm glad it is dead, however, increasing the block size at some point is probably a wise thing to do.

Finally an analogy I️ can get behind. 
@_date: 2017-09-16 16:38:29
It is called chart analysis or technical analysis. It means OP thinks s/he can predict the price going forward by looking at the charts of past price. It is the investing equivalent of tea leaves and horoscopes. Don't be a rube, ignore these people.

Great system.

In theory, it is good.  Segwit allows for smaller transactions so you can fit more per mb, and the 2x make the blocks bigger so you can fit even more transactions into them.  Only going 2x instead of 8x (bitcoin cash) means that running a node will be harder than before because it will take up more space and bandwidth, but it won't be as extreme as bitcoin cash.  In reality, the thing that makes this contentious and bad is that it was done in a shady manner by big companies which pissed everyone off and they aren't adding replay protection so it could cause people to lose their coins.  It basically it represents big companies and special interests controlling bitcoin which is antithetical to the original ethos of bitcoin.

One of the major contributors to the great depression was people taking out bank loans to buy stocks in a hot market. Congrats on being an idiot of historic proportions. I hope you don't lose this bet though because then I lose some money too (money I can afford to lose).  RemindMe! 1 year

Dollar cost averaging.  Set a schedule, buy X ammount's worth every month/wee/day.

I agree, many drug users are not going to pay with crypto, however, it is probably very useful for dealers to buy from their suppliers and every step up the chain where the money is even bigger.  I'd assume it is much easier for a manufacturer to received a ton of Bitcoin or Monero instead of a suitcase of cash.

It isn't meaningless or arbitairy like OP says, yet it isn't as meaningful as you're claiming. The real metrics that matter are things like active users,  average balance per user, and average balance per active user, etc.  There could be thousands of accounts with no value because they sign up, saw the fees and just left. It's great that so many people are signing up, but if they don't do anything they don't help much. Facebook measures total users but the real metric they are trying to boost is active users because they don't make money on users who log in once every three months.

"The best revenge is living well." - I forget who said this, but I bet they are smart. Ignore him and enjoy your gains.

Do you have a set time every week or is it a bit more random than that?

An analogy that I prefer to use instead of athlete is a professional poker player. While there is luck involved in poker, there is also skill in knowing both people and knowing the odds. The same handful of people generally get far in the WSOP every year and while there are bad beats they can replicate success in the long term.  Traders can't consistently have that type of success because there isn't nearly the same level of skill involved.

Dollar cost average yourself.  Set up a timeline and go for it. You'll be happy down the line.

This lesson applies to a lot more than just bitcoin.

I'm under the impression that with bread wallet you are in control of your keys therefore you'll be fine. But I'm just some idiot who did Google and reddit searches so I may be wrong.

How long have you been doing this?
@_date: 2017-07-22 21:55:40
You should read up on dollar cost averaging.

Fingers crossed it goes to $490k.
