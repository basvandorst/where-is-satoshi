Then you should keep *your money* in *your possession* so that *you* can use *your money* without ever having to 'pay' someone to retrieve it.
You know, because it's all about *you* right?

As of right now, you are the *only* person to post publicly that they are going. Good on you. 
I hope you enjoy yourself and let us know how it goes.

I get and agree with what you are saying... but I seriously hate that in today's society, for almost everything we do, we must think in terms of liability.

You described, as you said, buying power... and even that is not correct. That million is still a million dollars. I can still buy one million $1 items... just like I could have fifty, seventy, one hundred years ago.

Look, seriously, I am not being an asshole here but you really need to study economics. You have a very low understanding of how these things work.

When I wrote that, post was all that I saw where they said they'd be there. I must have missed that one.

Will it?
If I had a million dollars fifty years ago and stored it under my bed and then decided to take it out and spend it today, would it still be a million dollars? What would that million dollars be worth?

I agree 100% and, on another account I used to have, I argued that point time and time again only to be downvoted. People act like all this corp and govt fucking is new. Not hardly... railroad tycoons, steel barons, so on and so forth.
What I am referring to is how sue happy we have become and it is getting worse and worse every year. You cannot tell me that, at any other point in our history, we have been more open to civil suits from dumbfucks that want to get rich without working.

Bitcoin is a commodity like gold. Bitcoin is no more "money" than gold is "money".

No I am not! Yes the numerical value is constant, however so is the dollar. It is always 1. Everything moves up and down in relation to the dollar.
How much is a U.S. Dollar worth? What is one U.S. Dollar's value, right now? How much will that exact same dollar be worth tomorrow? It is the items that fluctuate in value where we use the dollar as a trade medium. Again, the big difference is that... the dollar **never** fluctuates in value. The U.S. Government guarantees that no matter what... no matter if all of these items that everyone is using to make their point lose all monetary value... you can still trade that dollar for one dollar's worth of stuff... whatever that means to the people trading.
You might say that of course all of that stuff... that is what gives the dollar its value.
No, the U.S. Government gave it its value. You also placed a value on your item(s) in terms of the dollar. Why? Because it is backed by the U.S. Federal Government to be worth... *One Dollar*
If, 50 years ago you bought a home for $30,000 and today you looked to sell it. All that you end up getting for it is $30,000. What was that dollar you spent 50 years ago worth? What is the dollar you collected today worth? Again, one dollar. Did you 'lose' money by purchasing that home for $30,000 and selling it for only $30,000? Did the value of your dollars go down?
@_date: 2013-06-05 13:16:56


You are describing the value of that item, not the value of the dollar that was used to purchase that item.
That dollar from 50 years ago is still a dollar. It's value is $1. It will never be a $2 bill. It will always be a $1 bill that is only guaranteed to be worth $1. You *could* take that dollar and say it will buy a $2 item but if you attempted to redeem that $1 bill for $2 you would be laughed at.


Not at all. I am very serious. A lot of people make this mistake and lose a bunch of money because of it. They think that sitting on some money is bad because they are "losing" money. How in the hell can you lose something that isn't able to be lost because you never had it?
For your 87% theory to work you would have to make huge assumptions as to what I would have done with that one million dollars 50 years ago. What if I bought one million, one dollar shares of company X that went under 10 years later. Are my one million dollars worth less now? (hint: those one million dollars are still one million dollars, even though I lost them)
Yes, 50 years ago I could have taken my one million dollars and probably purchased an absurdly giant mansion beach side in some swanky neighborhood, whereas today I would most likely only be able to afford a very nice home in a gated community.
That is the value of the homes and property increasing, not the value of my dollar going down.

I agree with that statement, however, see what happens if these merchants cannot trade their Bitcoins in for USD. See how many still take it as, what you call, a currency.


Not even close...
@_date: 2013-06-05 13:52:51
I get it, as you obviously do, that the bill itself has no value. 
The value in the dollar lies in the fact that it is guaranteed by the U.S. Government to be worth whatever its printed value is. Yesterday, today and tomorrow, the value of a $1 bill will still be one U.S. Dollar. The prices of houses can wildly go up and down, stock markets can crash and go through the roof, milk can be $2.00/gallon or $200/gallon... my dollar will still be a dollar.
@_date: 2013-06-23 22:22:55


I do not understand what you are saying.
@_date: 2013-06-23 22:46:32
Who, literally, guarantees Bitcoins will be worth anything when you want to trade them for something? (Nobody)
Now ask yourself, who, literally, guarantees that "currency" will be worth something when you want to trade it for something? (Whatever national government the currency belongs to)
Finally, ask yourself, who/what literally gives Bitcoins their value? (at this time: the USD)
**Everything** you've said about Bitcoin is wholly dependent on being able to be traded for the USD. Now, understand, it doesn't matter if it is USD, Yen, Euro, whatever... as you have said, no one accepts goods as a trade for products/services. Imagine if the U.S. Government stopped allowing the trade of Bitcoins for USD. Bitcoin would die on the spot. Nobody would want it because they would not be able to do anything with it.
Anyway, again, you seriously need to study economics. You can never move to the future if you do not understand the past. I would suggest you thinking long and hard before repeating all the propaganda that people spout about Bitcoin.
Understand, I want to see Bitcoin work. I want Bitcoin to blow up and be completely awesome. I also understand that it is in fact a commodity. Its value is wholly dependent upon its USD trade in value. I feel that as long as you truly understand and accept this you will do well with Bitcoins.

If I happen to dig up a suitcase that was buried and forgotten for fifty years and that suitcase happen to contain a million one dollar bills, did that money lose value over the course of those fifty years in which it was buried? After opening up the suitcase, and assuming that all the bills are in mint condition, would each of those bills today be worth $1 totaling $1,000,000?

I don't know man... Canada has a lot of money but I doubt that they have enough to satisfy the insatiable financial appetite of OrangeSn0w.

Merchants only accept Bitcoin as a trade because they choose to do so. If Newegg decided to accept gold for a motherboard then they could very well do so. Nothing is stopping them from doing this. The U.S. Dollar is *guaranteed* by the U.S. Government to be worth $1 USD therefore they choose to accept USD instead of gold.
TL;DR it is "easier" for merchants to accept USD than it is anything else thus they accept USD as trade for products/services.
@_date: 2013-06-23 22:28:21


Yes I could, if someone accepted gold, wheat, crude oil as payment. Furthermore, Bitcoins are only as good as their ability to traded for "real currency". If there is no ability to trade for "real currency", the Bitcoin becomes worthless no matter if online or in real life.
