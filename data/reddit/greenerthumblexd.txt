Nobody in this pic is exchanging money that I can see.

Not really. The Bitcoin community ethos intersects in many ways with the ten principals. 
The bay area is also filled with nerdy tech bros who probably interface with cryptocurrency projects and companies more than the average person. It was only a matter of time.
I would honestly be much happier seeing Buttcoin art on the playa though.

I might add that Burning Man is not anti capitalism, they are anti commodification. There is an important distinction there. 
The bmorg actually acknowledges that "turnkey" camps have been an issue in recent years, and have been doing some work educating those camps on the 10 principals. The conspiracy you put forth that artists pay to come to entertain billionaires at the monetary benefit of the bmorg is interesting, but wholly inaccurate.

How are Bitcoin transactions not taxable? Any income a business claims (which should technically be all) is taxed, as ultimately the businesses aren't making Bitcoins they're making their countries currency.

Buying bitcoins to take money "to the bank" after "a huge increase in value" is an investment.

"... But if you are making the occasional large cash withdrawal, the bank wants to make sure it's the right way to make the payment."
Is that really the banks responsibility, to make sure you make YOUR payments with YOUR money correctly?

Your concern might be more centered on data, not info. I used to be all for it, and I think it's a great way to share Bitcoin within social networks, but after reading this well articulated article I am having second thoughts and will probably not be using it as much if at all:
Here is a slightly more cynical article from the same author:

This. Always good to see all sides. There are very different cultures and opinion over there.

You are thinking of Sia. 
@_date: 2017-04-06 04:52:08
And USA.

They won't reply on Twitter, either. 
@_date: 2017-04-24 08:13:57
Probably because Coinbase customer service is horrible and they never respond to emails. 
@_date: 2017-04-24 14:44:13
Actually, that's not true. They sent a generic follow-up email one week later completely dismissing the original email by pretending they had actaully answered my question. Still no acknowledgment on Twitter though. 
@_date: 2017-04-25 06:17:24
I haven't, mainly because of the aforementioned issue of them completely ignoring my emails and tweets. Members of our local meetup confirm 7+ days before a response typically comes through for them. In my case it's been 2 weeks, 3 emails, a survey (marked POOR with exact reasons why) and several tweets to  Still no response. 
since you seem to be lurking here please let me know how to actually get through to Coinbase support to speak to someone about my issue before I start finding more creative ways to get your attention.

Use a wallet that let's you set dynamic fees, most wallets default to overpay. The mempool is often near empty and it can take minutes to confirm a tx at 10 sats/byte. Try it.

Because Ripple is a centralized coin. It holds no real value as a Cryptocurrency.

Sia is a good buy. Ripple is not.
