Clarification  for "all in", "all in" simply means what you're willing to risk in a speculative market within a five to ten yr time frame.
Temper your expectations within your time frame and realize this isn't a game.  This is disruptive technology that has the potential to change the world as we know it, and this is the ground floor.

But you have to figure that 2.8 was probably 1.4 in november, spectacular rise, then a obvious correction with end result of 1.8 in less than 38 days he still has kick ass profits.  We all took the same ride with different size investments and end up the same place, relatively.

Maybe consider ethereum it's going to be as much a play as Bitcoin.
I think Bitcoin is the major force but in the end there will be three or four crypto currencies that are mainstream, and Bitcoin and ethereum being top two.
Either way, invest only money you are willing to risk loosing.

No. Not this.  I don't condone telling those to leave.
I'd say use as a learning experience ,  and to further explore and use the other more important side of this movement to a decentralized currency and start using your coins to purchase things.
We're not kidding when it's said for investment holdings it's speculative. 
For day to day, week to week purchasing goods and services purposes, nothing is more important to the success of bitcoin than that it gets adopted and used.

How did they rate the murderers I wonder, did they rate each kill like a 5/5 for a clean no muss no fuss murder or for a slightly sloppy one where they failed to double tap they'd maybe get a 3/5.

But safe for what?  For the 95% that use it to provide a certain level of anonymity its probably good enough still, but I wouldn't trust it for life and death need for anonymity or Military or Political needs either. 
With the NSA revelations not 100% revealed, I'm leaning towards backdoors installed in ALL levels of cryptography.  Need stronger keys.
