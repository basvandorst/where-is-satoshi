because credit card companies don't have millions of dollars for no reason. This idea of cash back and  reward points and scare tactics of debit not being safe. Even though every debit card is backed by the same people. It's about control. I feel they are Evil and things like bitcoin our the future. You've bought into the system so much you don't even see that there could be a better way. To each there own, but it's not like I don't understand how a credit card works. I've just seen their evil and struggles of people who have been burned by huge amounts of debit. Just like a dealer selling crack to people. They prey on the frail and weak, and inexperienced. So I say Fuck you to credit cards. But Fuck me right.
