Even if that were a deciding factor, I don't really see how an optimization could be harmful to the network. I do realize it's a patented technique, which I agree is rather shady in a decentralized environment.

Technical debt, and being more complicated for end users and wallet developers.


I thought they already had. 3rd party malleability, that is.

Because it's an overly complex solution to a simple problem.

BTG is premined.

The idea of cryptocurrencies isn't that new. The NSA was already researching it back in the 90's:

A spike there means someone accidentally overpaid, or was feeling generous. Only if everyone were to do that, *and* keep the blocks full at the same time, the fees would rise for everyone.

Contact their support. Someone could be spoofing your identity.

You would have received a secret key, they tell you to write it down when activating 2FA.
You should be able to enter this key in your new phone's authenticator app.

If you still have your old phone I think you can deactivate 2FA, and then reactivate it with a new key on your new phone.

Miners secure the network. Nodes only increase bandwidth costs.

Then what if everyone enables whole-block pruning? How would new nodes even sync at all?
@_date: 2017-08-26 16:51:59
Pruning mode seems to remove whole blocks, instead of individual transactions. Not quite the same thing.

I don't think Electron Cash does that anymore, it uses its own data folder now. In any case your wallet should be encrypted, so Electron won't be able to read your Electrum keys unless you enter the password.
@_date: 2017-11-26 10:15:12
Electron cash no longer copies electrum wallets, see here: 
and yes, if you use different passwords for both wallets there's no way your Electrum keys can be read by Electron, or vice-versa.

On the referenced pull request ( it says this change was merged on sep 29. The original version didn't import any keys, it only copied your electrum wallet file to the electron cash folder as a convenience. That's harmless without having the password, but any programs touching wallet files without your consent should be deemed a security risk.

The magic of FUD and hearsay can turn anything into a big deal. Still I'm glad that "feature" was removed, no program should ever touch your wallet files without asking.
