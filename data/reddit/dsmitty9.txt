Nissan GTR... probably because I’ve played so much need for speed and that’s always the car I’d pick

Or they hit their moon

You forgot one small factor... the fees... they are what get you... or else everyone would do that. As soon as price goes up they pull out. It dips they put back in wash and repeat except there are some fees involved so it’s not that easy.

Easiest way... have mom or dad do it give them money and transfer to your wallet. Bonus: they pay any and all taxes on it
@_date: 2017-12-28 03:57:02
Remember: 
1) don’t put it what you can’t afford to lose
2) you only lose when you pull out 
3) don’t make up stories

The higher the fee the higher the priority for the miner to accept the transaction.

You’re literally a hypocrite... saying you want to cash out at 20k but can’t because people keep... cashing out... maybe they reached their target and are getting out now.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:37:51
Maybe triple digit coins
@_date: 2017-12-26 16:54:44
This is just like the app cyndicator. Except you make your own votes and based on how close you are they pay you out in a certain amount of crypto. Also you can invest in it, it’s ticket is CND. It runs bots so it can increase profitability for you.
@_date: 2017-12-27 23:07:27
Yeah... it was “hacked”...
@_date: 2017-12-25 19:21:38
Too bad that’s a pic of a computer screen... and the counter is how many times you’ve checked the price of BTC today.
@_date: 2017-12-28 14:37:48
It’s basically free though if it’s bought with profits off crypto so why does it matter?
@_date: 2017-12-27 00:27:49
I zoomed in and was like where tf is bitcoin... zoomed out and saw it right away... oops
@_date: 2017-12-24 04:55:11
So should you sell and rebuy at a lower price?
@_date: 2017-12-26 23:19:36
I’ve always wanted a monkey. But it’ll be kind of weird having 0.4 of a monkey.

Personally I am pro binance. Have not come across any issues with it at all besides the weird thing happening today on mobile but I usually check binance on my computer so nbd. Haven’t tried bittrex yet
@_date: 2017-12-30 13:34:39
Buy the rumor and sell the news
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:27:45
This reminds me of the XRP guy that every time he refreshed the price would go up
@_date: 2017-12-28 14:47:52
Maybe he reached his moon and wanted an iPhone X (that was my original goal) I had that at one point but decided to reinvest and I’m not touching it until I graduate from college in Fall of 2020.

Fox isn’t the fake news it’s NBC
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:28:22
Only if he’s a hick
@_date: 2017-12-17 16:24:27
Why doesn’t your chart there have Binance?
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:27:13
It’s based on what people are willing to pay for it. Just like anything else really.
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:03:19
The way I see it is it gets attached to another transaction and that other one is paying the fee for that block... please correct me if I’m weong
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:05:05
This movie is what got me started... well legally anyway
@_date: 2017-12-17 16:01:32
Shelf-researching chemicals..
@_date: 2017-12-19 06:02:02
Much better investment than dogecoin
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:40:02
That’d only be about $1500. Which in retrospect is not all that much. And including fees you’d be looking at about $1485. And then paying taxes on the profits (around 40% probably... just a total guess)... so yeah don’t beat yourself up too much
@_date: 2017-12-25 22:38:06
Fake news
@_date: 2017-12-27 00:36:59
My thinking is they are taking advantage of the newbs while allowing those in the know to not pay fees 
@_date: 2017-12-25 17:22:25
I feel it’s more in the first sell off phase if this chart even is accurate... so it’s about to take off to the moon.

If the phone was messed up it would say 28.2% damaged. His phone is fine being 28.1%.
@_date: 2017-12-29 05:43:10
That’s what I’ve started doing. I put my loose change at the end of each week into ripple and so far it’s worked out quite well.. much better than sitting in my change cup in my car.
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:05:19
I feel it is drastically over valued at the moment but then again what do I know. Reasons I am diversifying and getting into the smaller cryptos such as XRP and CND.
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:14:37
I’m sure it’s all based off bitcoin because a lot of exchanges based how much money you have to a bitcoin. So if bitcoin dips people just panic sell all their assets. When bitcoin goes up people buy into anything and everything.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:54:51
Well that’s what you get for playing with money you can’t afford to lose
@_date: 2017-12-24 13:32:30
When I first read this I thought you meant your brother, who was a lawyer... but then I continued reading and it said goes to college and realized I’m a dummy and it’s literal brother in law.
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:22:39
Just hold on strong... and buy at the right time
@_date: 2017-12-17 06:05:44
Please read up on it. Provide more information... did you pay with debit card? Or bank account?
