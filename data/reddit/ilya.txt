Public key is a function of private key. And the private key is what matters for this question. If somebody generates a public key which produce the same address as existing one, but they don't have a private key corresponding to this public key - nothing to worry about. So how many public keys correspond to a given address - is a completely different question.

tldr; I don't need to be explained how fractional numbers are represented in float format. I did DSP code optimization before you probably compiled your first "hello world". You don't seem to bother to read what your opponent says, just assuming everybody except you is a dumbass. I never suggested to use decimal fractions for storing monetary values. But **any (whole) number of satoshis from 0 to 21000000x10^8 can be stored and manipulated in double float without the loss of precision.** (make sure you read that before bothering to answer)
2099999999999999 satoshi = 1.11011101011111000001011010000001110011111111111111 (base 2) x 2^50, in double float:   0100 0011 0001 1101 1101 0111 1100 0001 0110 1000 0001 1100 1111 1111 1111 1100 (base 2), 431D D7C1 681C FFFC (base 16)
1 satoshi = 1.0 (base 2) x 2^0, in double float: 0011 1111 1111 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 (base 2), 3ff0 0000 0000 0000 (base 16)
5 satoshi = 1.01 (base 2) x 2^2, in double float: 0100 0000 0001 0100 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 (base 2), 4014 0000 0000 0000 (base 16)

Better than fixed precision if you need to do non-trivial math (e.g. to calculate fees), otherwise you waste resources on conversion to/from double anyway, or end up with some inefficient software emulation instead of using hardware float math.
Other than that, when moving it around or storing, it's just a 64 bit value, same as 64 bit integer in terms of efficiency

Birthday paradox may be applied to answer the question "How likely it is to have *at least one* address collision among **all** generated addresses?". 
It's not applicable to the question "How likely it is for somebody to generate the same address as *my*?". Applied to birthdays, that would be "how likely it is for somebody in a group of N persons to have the same birthday as mine?". And the answer is 1-(1-1/365)^N , which for the group of 23 persons is 6.1%. Compare to nearly 50% for birthday paradox question.
And of course birthday paradox has nothing to do with the question "How likely it is that somebody else generates the private key which produces the same address as my?".

@_date: 2014-02-06 09:28:37
I can see two possible explanations for such behaviour.
**Explanation I**
MtGox sends bitcoins to recipient A using output O1.
Transaction is confirmed by the network.
For some reason MtGox don't see this confirmation, sends money again using a different output O2.  MtGox believes that O1 wasn't spent.
It then tries to spend output O1 again to send money to other clients, and that fails.
**Explanation 2**
MtGox sends bitcoins to recipient A using output O1.
For some reason, at the same time MtGox sends bitcoins to recipient B using the same output O1 (poor/missing locking mechanism).
One of those transactions is confirmed, say transaction to A. Output O1 is marked as spent.
But later Transaction to B times out, and output O1 is marked as unspent.
Output O1 is later used to transmit coins to other clients (or same client B).
In any case, relying on transaction confirmation alone is a bad idea, and is a severe case of ~~goxing~~ gross incompetence. They should've checked the output wasn't spent before retransmitting coins.
First scenario is more ominous, because it means MtGox were losing coins for two months and didn't notice that. In that case, fixing their software will help to stop losing money, but wouldn't help to recover what they've already lost.
Second scenario is more malign. They just need to prune spent outputs and stop trying to use spent outputs for further transactions.

They are making good profit. Look at it from this perspective: as soon as they enable withdrawals, they are done, everybody will withdraw and nobody's going to deal with them again. But as long as they keep situation uncertain, withdrawals disabled, they make profits from transaction fees and arbitrage. They buy coins on their own exchange, sell on Bitstamp/BTC-e, move money around to their account, buy again on MtGox, etc. They have already made a huge profit, and there is no reason whatsoever to stop while there are cheap coins offered on MtGox. At some point, only the most stubborn will left, the price will go up, reach the balance with other exchanges, and at this point Mark will suddenly "fix" the bug.

I do have an idea. I also realize that the very same transaction malleability allowed double-spending of zero-confirmed transactions when malleated transactions started to be rejected by part of the network, but still allowed by another part, making something that was considered unlikely, very much likely. [edit: I know this is not what MtGox issue was about.. not a widely known issue at least.] Probably there are still miners around which would mine malleated transactions, who knows.. it's still not a protocol rule. But it's unlikely after [smapbot attacks](
I expect some more surprises like that ahead. You better be safe when new technology and money come together.
Edit: I think this requires more explanation. Situation: merchant accepts malleated transactions with malformed signatures, part of the network accepts, some miners do accept, some miners don't. Attacker sends payment with malformed signature, receives goods. Chances are it's not mined. Send again with correctly formed signature to his own address. Chances are this is mined by miners who never received or rejected the previous transaction. Profit.
@_date: 2014-03-03 22:33:52
Yes I do, and it's not retard in many (or even most) practical situations. Imagine you need to calculate 0.22% fee, or volume weighed average price, or log scale chart. For all that, you have to convert your integer to double first. You may be not aware, but that's what compiler does for you when you multiply integer to float, or call library function which takes double as it's parameter. Then you convert the result, which is double float into integer again. 
If your calculation has multiple steps, you may lose precision if using integer, because of implicit rounding of the intermediate values.
The only situation when integer is marginally more efficient is when you only need to calculate trivial things like add/subtract/compare.
@_date: 2014-06-02 01:33:38


I agree, this is an understatement. But Bitcoins have their own problems.
* Bitcoins can be accidentally lost or stolen, unless you are tech savvy enough to take necessary precautions, which also requires some effort.
* Transaction may take unpredictably long time or not complete at all if the fees are not sufficient.

* As network grows, fees will increase, and it's going to be uneconomical make small transactions (unless you use trusted third party)

Neither did MtGox..
Edit: My point was - if there is no problem reported so far, it doesn't mean there is no problem, or that it will never occur in the future. Malleablility was a known issue since 2011, but was considered non-issue by many. Same with related 0-coinfirmation spending of the change, which turned out to be an issue later because of malleability. It's a very weak argument, especially for such a new and untested technology. Should be approached with care if you don't want to be burned.

That's why you use *double float* value for bitcoin amount, expressed in Satoshi - to avoid accumulated rounding errors when doing calculations. And after calculation round the value, depending on your chosen resolution.
I hope you never program a system that looks after money before you learn even more about floating point. There is nothing inherently dangerous in it. What is dangerous is little learning and following rigid rules without understanding what they are about.

To the person who downwoted me: you are too quick to judge. The patch is a work in progress in Sipa's personal branch of bitcoin code. It has nothing to do (yet) with the main bitcoin branch.

Oh dear, one sound person in a dozen of fools. Sometimes I think that stupid people who believe rumours like that deserve to be goxed... All transactions listed in OP are just dust/change aggregation which is performed automatically by the wallet in background. Most inputs are small, there is single output (no change), and no fee - so it's not withdrawal. What's worse, there are other "stuck" transactions which try to reuse same inputs.. which indicates their wallet software is still faulty and they didn't fix *anything* at all. And the reason these transactions were listed as stuck in the first place is because MtGox still tries to use immature coins (known issue since September at least as gmaxwell pointed out earlier). So *nothing at all* has changed. Relax.
@_date: 2014-02-18 17:45:13


That's what I was saying, "As far as their bitcoin software was concerned, coins never left their wallet". The accountant never had a chance to take this transaction into account, because their bitcoin software was faulty. This is not a book-keeping issue. Just a case of shit software. MtGox software in this case.

One consideration: the tree must be generated at a predetermined times, e.g. at a particular time once a day, and include balances at that time. Otherwise the custodian may generate an ad hoc tree not including other nodes when particular user requests intermediate hashes/balances, and the top hash, claiming that it just has changed.

I wonder how is it possible. If any of the outputs of transaction are less than 0.01 XBT, then a fee of 0.0001 XBT is required. And anything with outputs below 0.0000543 is considered non-standard and not relayed/mined by default. This is a measure which was implemented a while ago to discourage "dust" transactions. There are also limitations on the size of transaction, so it's unlikely that they send thousands of satoshis in one go. To me it looks unpractical to send few spam transactions and spend 0.0001 in fees. Can somebody publish transaction id, I would like to see how they do that.
@_date: 2014-03-06 16:37:07

MtGox is not trying to fix anything. I can say it with 100% certainty. If they had a slightest commitment to resolve the issue, they would have already done it a long time ago, in spite of all their stupidity and incompetence. It's a very simple issue from technical point of view; it doesn't require weeks of investigation, then weeks of whining and finger-pointing, then weeks of "hard work to fix". Don't buy this *bullshit*. They crashed the price to get cheap coins. Deliberately.

You theory is based on a few assumptions:

2) It's going to be possible to get fiat from insolvent MtGox and
3) It's not going to be impossible to get bitcoins from insolvent MtGox.
I think that combined probability of 1) 2) and 3) is not comparable to 80-90% loss.

Let's be honest here, Transaction ID might be a misnomer now, but it was not meant to be this way when bitcoin client was designed. Transaction malleability became apparent only in 2011, two years later. And that complicates things quite a lot, requiring some extra work on the wallet side to work out which transactions were actually confirmed. Also this makes transaction chaining risky - which would be a valid practice otherwise.
So in the long term we need some sort of replacement for transaction ID, if possible at all. In the short term the reference client should not allow spending unconfirmed change by default. This patch is already made and will be available soon.
