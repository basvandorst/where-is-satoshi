I work with  We are in India as well and have heard nothing from any authorities. We do have banking partnerships and have confirmed with them that there is no problem. The statement of 'We have investigated the possibility to operate through other banks, but it seems this is a general policy in India as of today.' is quite misleading and seems to have been thrown around loosely.
