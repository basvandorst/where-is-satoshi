Idiot here! Locked my wallet with 20 coins in it by making a 14 char pw I can't remember. It's max 9 diff characters and one day will be easy to brute force, so I keep still keep it with tons of backups. 
On a side not I found out I forgot it when I was trying to sell some coin off at $40 a piece. So perhaps not all that terrible if I can open it one day lol.

I was able to replace the wallet with an older backup but it still didn't work :(
My fear is that I canged it to a 13 digit number password. If I know for certain the first 4 digits and the last 3 how long would it take to brute force?

Yes it's either that or a word+numbers(that I know) and I fatfingered one of the keys when setting it.

I've been playing around with day trading lately. I sold my "play around with" btc at 92 when things started going down and just bought at 76. Any way I look at it I'm happy. I'm holding more btc than I had a couple hours ago. I'm in this for the long haul.

Listen I already feel stupid there is really no need to rub it in okay.

I know the word but I think I fat fingered a key or something.

Very cool, choice is always nice to have! Now I have to do some more reading!

How would I load the backup?
@_date: 2013-03-07 00:51:27
If this helps(idk if it does) I have backups, which I believe don't have the current passphrase on them and will have an older one I remember for sure. But they don't have my up to date bct amount.

I'm sorry I can't find that directory for the life of me. And I searched for wallet.dat and can't find it either.

Thank you both! This will work very well. Now I got some reading to do!
