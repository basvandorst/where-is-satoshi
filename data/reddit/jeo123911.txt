It's still inherently worthless. The cost to manufacture is never the value of a product. Just because you spent $1000 to create a ping-pong ball spaceship doesn't mean anyone wants to buy it for that much.

And what makes the fiat empire of bitcoin not susceptible to the exact same collapse you say happens to every empire?

If it's a "soft" collapse where the economy just goes down somewhat hard, then like I said, bitcoins are just as good an investment as pretty much any other currency or precious metal.

Agreed, but in a global collapse, stuff of no immediate use like bitcoin, gold, or money will have nobody that wants to trade for it.

And that's what I'm getting at. Nobody will treat a currency seriously if it has 1000% swings within a month.

Much like gold and any other finite-supply item. The problem is, you can't eat gold nor bitcoin. They're inherently worthless in a crisis situation that would need to happen to cause paper money to lose value as well.

So I'm curious what's the price graph for BTC and wow. No wonder only speculative investors actually keep it and everybody else exchanges instantly to local currency.
I thought it went from $50 in 2013 to $400 now in a linear notion. To my surprise, there was a huge $1000 spike for a month. Talk about unstable as hell. (And just yesterday it jumped by 16% for no reason)

Which is why I assumed a situation where the dollar hyperinflates to the point it loses value is a situation where the global economy is so bad people would trade for food, shelter and bullets only.

Actual food. Because good luck getting electricity and Internet when the country collapses.

If the only thing losing value would be your local currency, then anything will be great. Euros, Canadian dollars, Australian dollars, Japanese yen, British pound, etc.
