But how far can they push these policies is questionable. Just how much more can they ban cryptos in China? This is getting cheesy. 
@_date: 2018-01-19 03:50:26
Hard to say where the price will go. 
@_date: 2018-01-18 19:53:52
I observed the same thing. 
@_date: 2018-01-19 03:53:57
Well, the Chinese crypto community needs to figure something out.

Hello my great leader. 
@_date: 2018-05-25 04:33:13
That's gonna left a dent on his scamming career. 
@_date: 2018-05-25 02:19:05
I never thought I could bring him this far. 
@_date: 2018-05-25 12:50:19

I never thought I could go this far with this guy. 
@_date: 2018-05-25 12:51:26
I'm sure I can get some crypto from him, but then that will be illegal. 
@_date: 2018-05-25 18:33:22
No, it's not. The golden part is his response:''yeah''. 
@_date: 2018-05-25 19:53:45
Or the shock and humiliation that came afterwards that might just made him wanted to quit all together. 
@_date: 2017-01-12 03:31:20
I hodl. 
@_date: 2018-04-03 00:40:47
That's where I sold the first one for CAD700. 
@_date: 2017-07-24 03:37:48
You just described the human being.

You don't need to jump right into Chinese culture and imagine how people will proudly buy Chinese Bitcoin because they are Chinese. And how Chinese government works has nothing to do with Bitcoin.

The total value of two chains would be somewhat 20% less than that of the original one. IMO
@_date: 2017-06-05 11:03:16
I'm nervous. I hope bitcoin will survive. 
@_date: 2017-06-06 06:32:27
5 trillion dollars will be the long term goal. 
@_date: 2017-06-03 03:33:02
Maybe other illegal stuff. Well, anything that can be used as a threat against Jihan.  
@_date: 2017-06-05 16:50:06
It should be much easier if you don't cash out and hodl. 
@_date: 2017-06-03 03:26:52
Three possibilities
A: Those miners have been doing something that's hidden from Chinese government. It might even be related to some mine owners themselves. 
B: He has a fast way to disable their mine. 
C: He's bluffing. 
 
@_date: 2017-06-05 17:02:23
KYC AML
@_date: 2017-06-05 04:55:47
Nope. 
@_date: 2017-06-05 04:38:42
I hope Bitcoin can survive this time. If the price comes back up after 8/1, I will treat my family a meal. All the best. 
@_date: 2017-06-05 15:24:05
What a junk Channel. 
@_date: 2017-06-05 15:38:27
You too.
