It's is if you are buying none existent oranges of no other value than resale and from a single supplier (which crates a trickle down btw).
Same thing exactly as this  just with a bit distraction in the form of the theoretical ability to generate some shares aka bitcoin by yourself which doesn't matter at all cuz your 50 new bitcoin won't even put a dent in the stockpile of the pepole a the top.

So the ponzi scheme isn't collapsing yet?
When will it be time already???
I so want to this happen.

True, but still the core idea is the same. Sale nothing at all like bad shares for something, like USD.

It's a share of not going to jail due to unpaid taxes.

In theory I could even cash out by buying 5,000 pizzas.

Lol. It's exactly as you described it. Earlier investors are paid with later investors funds.
The guy who could generate 25,000 bitcoin for a pizza are selling the bitcoin to whoever decides to jump on it right now in hopes of selling to other adopters down the road.
But there will come a time where demands runs out and all who wanted it bought it, then people will want to cash out and guess what mtgox and all the other exchanges and stores don't have enough to enable everybody to cash out, so like always the majority will be left with their dick in their hand.
@_date: 2013-04-13 19:59:28
My point exactly.
You think this a wonderful system free of central control but have you praised your new finical overlords today? Say a prayer to the mtgox admin and the go in charge if the other exchange that guy is talking about.
The other day mtgox closed the trade. Just a show of power. He can do whatever he wants.

It appears many fools want to get rich quick and easy.
The problem is there is no such thing as something for nothing.
@_date: 2013-04-13 18:56:15
What are those fantasies about majority and what have you?
The guy that runs mtgox decides how much your coin is worth.
Good luck cashing out your 1000 bitcoin if he decides not to do business with you.
The 5 people running the big mining pools control everything else is they decide to change anything in the protocol at all you will bend over and take it, otherwise your bitcoin won't be worth anything.
So please. Bitcoin is just like any other financial system controlled by a few powerful pepole.
If you want to believe in ponies fairies and unicorns go right ahead, but I'll always have this post in the future to tell I told you so.

In this reply we ignore the data and act like the majority of bitcoin generated so far isn't hoarded by a small number of pepole.
Similarly we imagine a world where I can cash out 10,000 usd not on mtgox.
Yeah now bitcoin seems pretty good.
