One thing I don't get is why do all the ASICs look the same? Where did this design come from? This is all so suspicious.

Thanks for the information about backup, that's something I will have to keep in mind.
In the end, any encryption method still relies on either remembering or writing down the secret passphrase, which brings us back to the beginning.

I thought we were talking about what we want to achieve,not what the current system offers.
@_date: 2018-01-14 12:08:02
But what do I do with the seed? Write it down? Where? I'm not sure whether I can remember it.
@_date: 2018-01-14 12:02:18
No, I was supporting your comment and going against his.
I am also saying that investing money should not mean saving money.
@_date: 2018-01-14 11:23:17
Also why would you want to invest money? The whole point of having money is to buy things, not make more money.

So is having your house burned down.
 People still get insurance.

I'm not saying Electrum is unsafe, but it did get a news article recently. I'm still using it, though.

If you use a recovery seed, what's the point of a hardware wallet in the first place? The seed is your point of failure.
The USB option sounds like a good idea.

Yeah, the thing with officials is that if you piss them off, they can come back and make your life worse.

Just as you said, it's only as safe as the user.
If you have multiple people using your internet, you are as safe as the least tech savvy person on that network.

I think that's what we're also trying to fix with Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-14 15:15:19
I'm not talking about transactions, just storage.
@_date: 2018-01-16 10:36:30
Because (almost) all of them are just a copy of Bitcoin itself. In one way or another.

There's also something resembling a sugar bag as well.

You can forget, and you can lose the pieces of paper.

Yes, our pitchforks are ready -----Е
@_date: 2017-12-02 16:24:53
Amen to that.
@_date: 2018-08-15 07:16:49
And at least one is real!
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:28:44
"Your virtual money is breeding terrorists REEEEEE"
@_date: 2018-06-08 06:45:34
Can confirm.
@_date: 2018-06-27 13:49:41
When is that fork due?
@_date: 2018-02-04 09:28:14
A comeback? When did it start losing or something?
@_date: 2018-02-08 10:54:32
I think you should try to spellcheck first.
@_date: 2018-04-24 16:21:54
Considering bitcoin.com belongs to btrash, it's OK by their definition.
