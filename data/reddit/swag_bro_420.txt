I've used gocelery.com for this and haven't had any problems with it. There are other sites listed in the wiki here:

Well, my main concern is bitcoin's volatility. It could go up a lot, and I plan on keeping around $10k in bitcoins, but it also could go down a lot, and I don't want to risk losing that much money. It's also much more convenient to spend money with a debit card, vs having to find somewhere that accepts bitcoin. What are the advantages of keeping it in bitcoin, that would outweigh this? While I would like to avoid paying taxes, I don't think the risk of getting caught is worth the savings.

Thanks for the information. Do you know if it's just Circle that does this? My wallet is at blockchain.info.

I'm not a regular gambler, this is the first year I've won money gambling. I am planning on declaring my income and paying taxes on it. As someone in the thread suggested, I'm just going to go to the bank, explain the situation, withdraw the money, and pay taxes on it. It's not drug money. I'm not worried about legal consequences--I had just heard that people have had trouble with large cash deposits at banks, and thought there might be similar problems with bitcoin. I wanted to make sure I didn't accidentally break the law, and I'm glad several people here pointed out that "structuring" can get you in trouble.

Speaking from personal experience, bitcoin is much more convenient for gambling than using a bank account. Withdrawals can take days or weeks if you withdraw in dollars through check or bank wire--but you can deposit/withdraw bitcoin in seconds.

I meant the laws against online gambling itself, not tax laws. I know gambling income must still be reported on tax returns.

Baseball season is ending soon, so I have no reason to keep the money in my sportsbook accounts any more. I wasn't really 'investing' in bitcoin, it was just necessary to use for the bets I wanted to make, so if I'm not betting, I have no reason to keep my money in bitcoin.

Websites usually don't choose what, specifically, is advertised on their website. If they use a 3rd party ad service, like google adsense, then the ad content is just determined by an algorithm that tries to match ads to what it thinks the website is about.

nitrogen.eu is the best I've used. Very quick grading, usually instant for major sports, and fast deposits/withdrawals.

Sports books have been taking US customers for years without any trouble. As long as they're based offshore, and the operators of the books don't step foot in the U.S., they're fine. 5dimes and bookmaker, for example, have been taking American customers at least since the UIGEA in 2006, and the government either can't do anything, or can, but doesn't really care enough to bother.

nitrogen.eu is a bitcoin-only website. bookmaker.eu is mainly a fiat currency website, but you can deposit/withdraw in bitcoin.

It is seconds. I've gotten withdrawals from nitrogen.eu in about 30 seconds. And they don't verify where the money is going at all, even though I'm on American soil. The accounts don't even have names attached to them, it's all anonymous.

Thank you, I didn't know services like those existed. I don't need the money right now, I just wanted to avoid the volatility of bitcoin.

Thanks for your advice. I think talking to the bank first would be best, I'll do that.
