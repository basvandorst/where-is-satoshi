Forbes is a fucking joke in the context of cryptocurrencies

Short ride is 50 ish, long ride is 110. Meanwhile pedicabs want to sell you for 80 and say you pay per person on the carriages which is a lie.

Cheaper than the bikes, pedicabs will straight up lie about the carriages and try to sell you an 80$ 30 min ride.

For most people it's a one-time thing for a special event or trip to the city. The rides are way cheaper than people actually expect.

Bikes straight up lie about the price of the carriage. It's much cheaper for a carriage tour than bikes. Pedicabs are pretty much a scam and will try to sell you a half an hour tour for 80 bucks.

Agreed. I tried that business out for 1 week but couldn’t get over the feel it was a scam since the carriages offered much more and much cheaper. Even tho I only experimented it at Central Park, I agree that it shouldn’t exist as they pose a big threat to people around them.

Yet you "Posts HODL memes". What is the reasoning behind you calling me a Kid? 


What are you talking about?


You are reposting low effort memes, it's spam. Members of this sub already know the what HODL means, another repost meme won't improve bitcoin

It’s not for transportation, it’s tour through Central Park.

Fuck these overused idiot unfunny and low effort memes that literally took you 2 seconds to put a text on that get posted by the hundreds in crypto subreddits that are at this point literally spam and nothing beneficial to its communities.
Good enough for you?

Shitposting and memeing doesn’t help bitcoin like you think it does. It gets repetitive and can negatively impact bitcoin by pushing people away from this subreddit.

No, it usually gets you to point A to point A
