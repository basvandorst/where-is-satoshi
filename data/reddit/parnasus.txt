So do I? I buy from coinbase in aud and their price is sitting at $16420 as I write, while btcmarkets is at $18165. Correct me if I am missing something haha.

The difference between markets in aud is huge. Can buy from coinbase at $16500 and sell to btcmarkets at $18000. Madness.

I don't have the capital to try regardless, but the prices have held this disparity all day (c. 8 hours).

I think the consensus is that there is always a risk in leaving your coins on an exchange and as long as they are there, they aren't really even yours.
That being said, if you only have a small amount you shouldn't worry too much, but it is a good habit to get into proper security measures :)

Thanks for the read, interesting stuff.

Ah I am a very small fish in this game, it isn't something I have the knowledge or funds to really prosper from, it just intrigued me when I saw the size of the gap!

Yeh, one would just need to capital to make it worthwhile. Buying a few hundred bucks worth on coinbase then waiting to transfer coins to btcmarkets, then selling, then waiting for a withdrawal to come through from them would likely take some time all up.
There may be some other catch I am not thinking of also. If anyone does take advantage from me pointing it out.... tips are welcome! haha

And then what happens next?

I can't fault the logic...
Not aussie, but it just may [work](

That is not inflation.
