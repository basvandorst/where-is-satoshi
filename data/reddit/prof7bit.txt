It should be enough to install one of the not so obscure Linux Distributions on an old PC, install Electrum (from the repository) and use that to generate a seed and a wallet and just don't use that PC for anything else, maybe securely erase the HDD again after you have written down the seed and a few receiving addresses.
On a scale from 0 to 100 this is 99.9998 secure.
Every other more complicated or more paranoid method is only useful if you insist on doing all this with some old Windows XP installation CD that is 1428 Hotfixes behind and would be virus infested 2 seconds after plugging in the network cable or if you have reason to believe that someone is already targeting specifically you and your bitcoins.

Every UTXO that is consumed in a transaction can be associated with a bitcoin address that was used in the previous TX that sent the coins there. 
The only exception are coinbase transactions, they spend new bitcoins coming into existence when a block was mined.
If I remember your name correctly then you must be extremely knowledgeable about the protocol in every detail, so I cannot understand why you are trying to confuse this user with extremely esotheric nitpicking **interpretations** of protocol level details that are trying to interpret it so as if there were no "from A" in "Sending bitcoins from A to B". The A in this case is an UTXO and for all practical intents and purposes every UTXO can be associated with a bitcoin address, or how else should the bitcoins have arrived at this UTXO?
Therefore on the application- and user interface layer every transaction can be assigned one or more "from"-adresses (directly resulting from the used UTXO), the only exception being newly created coins from mining a block.

If you know the private key corresponding to that address then you could craft and sign a transaction that spends any coins that have previously been sent to that address.
Whether you would call the collection of software tools that you would need to make the needed calculations to craft such a transaction a "wallet" is just a matter of definition.
There exists wallet software for end users that allows you to do that in a relatively user friendly manner if you temporarily supply it with the needed private key without permanently importing the key to the wallet.
Mycelium wallet comes to mind, there you can scan the QR-Code of a private key (for example printed on paper), use that to move some or all coins to somewhere else and then immediately let it forget that key again.
Most other wallet software should have similar functionality, some are harder to use or more error prone than others but it is certainly possible.
When entering the private key for that address into the software you should be able to **trust** the environment, the software, the entire computer which you are using, most people will therefore suggest that you should use this private key only once, empty said address completely in one transaction and then never use it again and rather send all remaining funds that you don't need to a brand new address whose private key has not yet come into contact with any potentially untrusted networked device.

They probably had a limit of 120kBTC per day because of their hourly settling of user balances they were moving approximatly 120k around every day.

Miners can neither print bitcoins nor can they confiscate them. Electrum servers can try to hide transactions from you but it won't result in coin loss, only inconvenience. I haven't heard of any such case yet, why should they do this, what would be their motive?

It can either be used like a normal wallet or optionally be configured for offline cold storage (sign offline and broadcast online on two computers like it was done with Armory in the old days). It does not need a huge and lengthy blockchain download, it is usable within seconds after startup. The wallet can be backuped and restored from a seed phrase written on paper.
For the mobile phone I would recommend Mycelium. Also with seed phrase.

Half an hour ago I installed the latest electrum (2.6.4) and restored a very old 12-word wallet (1.9.something) and it worked without any problems. When I typed the last letter of the 12th word the OK-Button became available.
So it should not be necessary to mess around with the word lists or manually check words, it seems can restore old wallets just fine.

@_date: 2016-08-21 13:26:00
This is nonsense and you know it.
The transaction in question clearly spends exactly one TXO which can unambiguosly be assigned exactly one bitcoin address. 
The one who signed that transaction, the previous owner of the coins, the entity who we wish to call "from", must have had control over that particular address, its private key (and probably still has) when he sent the coins.
Since we can unambiguously assign a bitcoin address to every transaction output and every such address must have been under the control of the entity who eventually spent it we can draw one huge directed acyclic graph of global bitcoin movement where every node (each representing one (U)TXO) has exactly one bitcoin address that was **owned and controlled** by the entity who initiated the transaction that spends it and links between the nodes (each representing the spending of exactly one TXO).
Each node that appears on the right hand side of any link in the graph is a transaction output and each of them has exactly one bitcoin address.
Each node on the left hand side of a link is either also a transaction output or it is a newly mined block.
Each link in that directed acyclic graph represents the spending of a TXO. Many links can belong to the same transaction.
Each link (each spending) has exactly two ends, exactly one node on each side, each of which is associated with exactly one bitcoin address.
The node on the right hand side of the link where the coins are sent to is called "To".
The node on the left hand side of a link where the coins are coming from shall henceforth be called "From".
If it were not possible to assign a TXO (and therefore an addresses) (or a block in a coinbase TX) to the left hand sides of **every** single link of this graph and it were therefore not possible to trace back the links from any node back to the point where the coins originated in a newly mined block then we would not have discussions about taint and its consequences. We would just all make transactions where coins disappear without a trace at one place and then rematerialize out of nothing in another place and time.
But such magic coin tunneling does not (yet) happen in Bitcoin.
Every transaction can be assigned one or more "From" Addresses, namely the address(es) owned and controlled and used by previous owner(s) of the coins, all the way back to the blocks where they were once mined.

You are paranoid because you work in I.T. security, it is your job to be paranoid, also because of your technical knowledge you are able to fear concrete scenarios and know how to protect against them.


Non-I.T folk either have only a diffuse fear of everything without being able to tell exactly what it is and don't have the slightest clue how to protect themselves against the unknown, or they have no fear at all because someone sold them some specific snake oil against the fears and they blindly believe it.

And where does the OS and the software on it come from? All the thousands of computers on which this software was developed by thousands of people have never been online and finally all the software was put together onto one DVD in a concerted effort without ever touching any network until it finally arrived at your home to be installed in your offline VM? Thats impressive!
And btw: the VM recommendation is dangerously misleading and wrong: If your host machine is controlled by an attacker then each and every virtual machine running on it is also compromised. It might be hard to **break out** of a VM, but its trivially easy to **walk into** it from the host PC side.

At least some old versions of Electrum accepted a lot more than only the words, you could for example also enter random hex strings or binary strings generated by flipping coins or things like that.
It did not use the indices of the words in the list to compose the binary seed, it just calculated a hash over   the input string or someting similar to that effect.
If this is the problem then OP should really try to temporarily install one of the old 1.x versions, restore the wallet and then send all coins to a brand new electrum wallet, generated with the latest version.

Its part of your wallet, it will automatically create a new change address to receive the change for every single transaction you send, so after a while there will be a lot of different change addresses, each holding a fraction of your coins but these change addresses are all part of your wallet and add up to the total balance.
It does this automatically and during normal operation you don't actually need to directly interact with or even see any of these change addresses, all you need to know is that they exist and the software is taking take care of managing them automatically.
Just wait until its fully synced and all available unspent funds in all addresses that are in your wallet will add up to the total balance.

They are just complying with what the regulation demanded: The BTC have been "delivered" to the user and so everything that happens to his BTC *after* the "delivery" is his own problem.
The trader who had borrowed $2000 for a long position but only $1000 in his account and the hack happens while he is in "posession" of these coins that he bought with the borrowed money will have his position force closed pay $1000 back to the lender (so his account will be zero) and owe another $1000 (plus interest) to the lender (or to Bfx if they choose to pay the other $1000 from their pocket).
Variant (b): The trader's position will just disappear, he keeps his $1000 in his account and the lender loses the entire $2000. Every trader with an underwater BTC long would prefer this scenario. But it is not likely to happen because the borrowed money was in the trader's "posession" while the theft happened.
Variant (c): The trader will lose everything and owe additional $1000 to Bitfinex (to reimburse the lender) and the lender is told the entire $2000 are gone: Bitfinex earns 2 BTC for every stolen 1 BTC and business can continue.

The wallet is always unlocked when the app is running because this is the first thing it does when the app starts: asking for password to unlock. From then on it is sitting there unlocked and waiting.
If the wallet is unlocked I can change the saved addresses (address book, contacts list or however it is called) in the GUI without entering a password again, only for spending I must enter it again to decrypt the private keys which are separately encrypted, separate from the rest of other the wallet meta data like contacts, labels, etc.
Additionally all 3.x versions of Electrum (prior to 3.0.4) have a bug that when you closed the last window the application **will not exit** but instead keep running in the background with the wallet still unlocked and the next time you started electrum it would show the currently open wallet without asking for a password at all.

Half of the transaction (the signature, the Witness) will be stored in an additional area of the block that does not count towards the hard block size limit of 1MB, so an 1MB block could now actually contain much more transactions if they were all SegWit and consequently the total block could then effectively be larger than 1MB, this is why it is also referred to as an effective block size increase (only noticeable when people actually start using it, only 10% use the new kind of transactions so far).
Additionally the space in the Witness area of the block (where half of your SegWit transaction goes) has been made significantly cheaper than the space in the old 1MB part of the block, so a transaction of same size would now need less fees than a conventional transaction, this was made to give people an incentive to actually start using it.

According to my understanding the following should apply: 
Whenever there are two areas of the network not optimally connected there would be an incentive for node operators to establish channels that bridge these gaps because they would then be able to collect all fees for any traffic between these two areas.
Whenever a channel is unused because it is redundant the node operators will close it or not want to allocate funds to such a redundant channel in the first place.
The above will work best if there is a way to determine the current topology of the network as a whole and the traffic that flows through it or some other mechanism to identify the most lucrative channel building opportunities for each node. 
**If** the above is possible then the network will automatically grow into the most ideal and most efficient topology possible and maintain that optimal state with extreme efficiency.
If the above is not yet possible then smart minds will create software for node operators that makes it possible to find the most lucrative channel opportunities and dynamically adjust the fees to attract the most traffic.

Why would you define coins that you unlocked from the heavy block chain and put them into a highly liquid instant transaction channel for instant spending anywhere as "locked"? Quite the opposite is the case: Funding a channel is like taking some money out of your savings account and load it onto your contactless prepaid mastercard. Would you refer to the money in that card as "locked" as well?

it is not required. It is just convenient for many people to visit only one place and buy or sell from/to a huge pool of other sellers or buyers.
You can also meet individual traders if you know where to find them for example through localbitcoins (also a centralized institution) or friends or other bitcoiners you know personally, then you can directly trade wallet to wallet.
The first bitcoin I ever sold for Euros a few years ago was a trade where I met with a stranger in a restaurant and we traded bitcoin for cash directly from wallet to wallet and had some coffe while waiting for confirmations. We didn't even use localbitcoins, we met through some messageboard and I contacted him directly via e-mail and then drove 20km to meet him.

1. You would not open a channel to each merchant directly and open and close channels all the time, instead you would permanently have one channel open to your favorite LN node.
2. BTC in a channel is not locked, quite the opposite: it is unlocked from the heavy block chain and can now move anywhere at the speed of light. You would typically keep *all* your spending money permanently in a channel to be able to spend it anywhere anytime instead of locking it into the block chain.

if you didn't open a browser and browse the web in the same VM then with this particular bug you are probably still lucky (if you didn't explicitly open it for unfiltered incoming network connections).
But note that a VM generally does not protect against attacks from the outside trying to break in, it only protects against attacks from inside the VM trying to break out! 
You should carefully re-evaluate your security architecture under this aspect!
* Evil things inside VM: can not (easily) break out of it.
* Evil things outside VM: can trivially easy break **into** any VM.
It would be more secure if you browse the web and install untrusted software in their **own** VM and have the sensible stuff in another VM and have **nothing** except the VM software itself running on the host at all, so the attacker would always have to break out of one VM and then into another VM to reach any other application.

Ok, the other half of this thread is talking about a hypothetical pizza place in the future that does, I probably answered to the wrong posting, but I'm sure this particular one will use LN too as soon as LN wallet software for users become available.


No, they actually never need to close their channel because they can send the money right back to the exchange over the same channel to convert it the very millisecond they received it. And since the net amount of money flown through that channel in each direction will be zero at all times they would not ever need to close it at all.

Additionally all versions prior to 3.0.4 would **not exit the application when you closed the last window** (known bug since 3.0, fixed 8 days ago  but instead kept running in the background with the wallet still unlocked in memory (you could close it and then start it again and this time it would not ask for a password).
The GUI would allow changing the contacts list (addresses with labels where one would for example store his exchange deposit address for easy access) **without** needing a password once the wallet is loaded and unlocked.
**Does the RPC API allow editing the contacts list?**
Only for spending the password must be entered again because the keys are still encrypted even when the rest of the wallet is unlocked. If changing the contacts via RPC is possible then even users who had a password set are vulnerable to this attack.

Why didn't they just use something simple on a naked TCP socket without http or even better just a named pipe for IPC, those cannot be accessed from any browser at all.

Yes the price should fall back to that area when this hype cycle ends. That's where people should place their buy orders and then wait a few months or half a year. Maybe even more buy orders at 3k and 2k

It is resiliant. It counters the attack with higher fees. The problem is coinbase just takes their customers money to pay for the attack and then blames it on Bitcoin although they themselves are causing the problem in the first place.

after entering your fee manually you can click the preview button, this will show you how the transaction would look like and also show the fee in Sat/Byte. 
It is suboptimal UI, it should display it immediately when entering the fee or let you enter it in Sat/Byte directly but currently with some more mouse clicking and try and error you can at least come reasonable close to a desired Sat/Byte value.

Bootstrapping seems to be going faster than expected: Now there is already a business [TorGuard] accepting LN payments even though it does not even exist yet on mainnet! You can already pay with LN at some places before it even exists! Imagine how it will expand once someone releases the first LN wallet for end users and the first LN hubs come online on mainnet.

It just needs to be connected to one node of the network, through that it will reach all other nodes.

If you had a password then it was probably not affected by this bug anyways.
And since the RPC is only bound to localhost the VM would have prevented a direct network connection from the outside because such a connection would then not have originated from localhost.
But a VM does not protect against attacks where the attacker knows he must first break into a VM, in that case he would have found a way.
The only really secure method for storing and using bitcoins safely is a dedicated hardware wallet.
Or an offline-signing setup with Electrum on a totally separate never connected PC and using cameras and QR codes to move transactions in and out of it.
Or at least use Electrum on a separate Linux pc, online and updated but never used for any other application than Electrum.
Never use it on windows, if you absolutely must use windows for some reason then the only reasonable option is a hardware wallet. It causes the least amount of complication for almost the maximum possible level of security ever.

Once you spot a pattern in the market and try to exploit it it will stop working immediately. Even more so if you publicly announce that you intend to wager money on it repeating yet another time. It won't repeat, and it will do so in the most disadvantageous way possible.

only if you have enough hash power to mine a block in reasonable time. The needed computing power and electricity for that would be enormous.
On the other hand: for every block you are able to mine yourself with your newly acquired mining farm you would be rewarded with 12.5 BTC plus all the transaction fees of all transactions in that block ;-)

It isn't. The block size was increased by counting the witness Bytes not as full Bytes and storing them in a separate location. So it could be done without a hardfork.
But it also enables real shrinkage later through things like Schnorr signatures which build upon these changes.

You can use the same channel to spend them anywhere else. Acually people will end up having all their shopping money in a channel all the time so they can use it whenever they want.




They can use the very same channel to send it back to the exchange, they can do so 1 millisecond after they received it, they don't need to ever close that channel at all.

The "dip" we are waiting for has not yet happened. You will know it when you see it.
I have experienced these dips already in the past, so I know what we are waiting for. You could consult the historic price charts to see what I am talking about, it has all been recorded for everyone to see and learn.
Edit: 
Just look at the dips this year alone:  and this chart does not even contain an example for the huge dip that happens every few years and wipes out half a years gains in 30 minutes. Compare that with the tiny price action at the upper right in this chart, your so called "dip" is barely visible.
Edit2: Here is a 6 year chart:  it contains a bunch of real dips, now THAT is what I would call a dip (in the context of Bitcoin, everywhere else it would be called a crash) and there is no reason to believe one of these cannot happen again, a dip of that kind would easily send us below $5000, $4000 or even $3000 if it were to happen now. Your so called "dip" you are talking about is completely invisible in this chart, it is buried in the weekly noise.
Edit3: If you want to make your buying/selling strategy dependent on relative price changes you better make yourself familiar with the various professional charting tools (not the stupid linear distorted bubble-panic charts from mass media) and study the historic price data to see how the bitcoin volatility really looks like and how the current price action is to be interpreted in relation to the whole picture.

Doesn't make sense. This would not have any impact on fees. Also there is no such thing as "clogging", fees are an auction, the highest bidders win the inclusion in the next block, lower bids have zero impact. To raise the price they need to bid higher. They would need to spam 300, 400, 500 Sat/Byte transactions to raise the fees above that level, for example what coinbase is doing by overbidding the fees like crazy (using the money from their customers, so it doesn't cost them anything).

Why doesn't somebody explain Bitcoin to Schiff already so we don't need to hear this nonsense about backing and intrinsic anymore?
* It is intentional that Bitcoin is not backed by anything or anybody, that's its main feature, that's what makes it better than the alternative. Just like gold is better than paper for the same reason: no counterparty risk.
* It has intrinsic value because it has a technical application, it is needed when you want to use the network, it's needed when you want to record a transaction or an ownership or a smart contract on the ledger, it is used as a token to represent and transfer the miner reward, so it has practical use and application outside of just being a collectors item. This is intrinsic value by its very definition and it is non zero.
Please someone explain this to him already so this nonsense of him can finally stop.

A nation with such a kind of police agents does not need any real criminals anymore.

No. Holding is not a joke, if it goes down you buy more and if it goes down further you buy even more, all the way down until it goes up again.
The people who are doing this know beforehand how much they will buy, how much more they can buy and can calculate exactly for every possible price level all the way down to zero how much coin they would buy at that particular level and **they have the money** to do this because they can use simple high school math to calculate how much of their net worth can safely be allocated in BTC and how much they should buy or sell at any particular price level to maintain that number.

Most likely totally impossible. It is a flash file system running on wear leveling flash memory. Similar to trimming file systems on SSDs all blocks that become unused will be reported to the flash memory device as unused immediately. Blocks that are marked as unused will become part of the wear leveling pool again and MUST read all zero, even if they have not yet been physically erased or reused yet, there is no way to read their old contents anymore.
You should have backuped the seed key.
This was  recommendation even when BTC was at $1000 and even back in the day when it was $1 it was the first thing **every new user has been told** repeatedly and with utmost urgency: **Backup your fucking keys!** Do it twice. And then do it again. And then test the backup.

I guess 99% of the funds there were buyers funds because only the buyers were required to deposit and hold large amounts of money there over longer periods of time. Sellers were paid out weekly.

When the fork coin has replay protection (like bch or btg) then it won't accidentally move along with the original coin. 
Forks without replay protection can be quite tricky to separate and cause a huge mess when not being aware of the problem. Forks without replay protection only work when all agree to use only the new fork from now on and let the old one die, for example when all agree to do a protocol upgrade and a fork is needed to implement it. That's what s2x attempted to do, except nobody actually wanted it so it never even happened, it would have been dead on arrival.

Why is it not important? If they mine at ghash then he could have just stayed where he is now.
The only recommended cloud mining is the one where you can choose yourself where the miners should be pointed at and the only one I currently know of that does that and that allows mining close to break even prices is nicehash. Betarigs also allows choosing your own pool but its too expensive.

@_date: 2014-06-14 18:27:15
I have decided to apply some low constant hashing from betarigs to always keep me above a reasonable minimum for p2pool and then occasionally have orders filled at nicehash at a price slightly below the required break even price when I am lucky which is causing intermediate bursts of multiple TH/s for a few hours to ramp up my pplns level occasionally. Its an up and down like a roller coaster with great variance in pplns rate and in the number of found blocks by p2pool but theoretically should give me back all my coins in the long run (at least it hasn't ruined me yet, I'm confident my calculations are correct, there was a nice sequence of blocks found a few days ago, almost at the height of my pplns curve but now a new block is already overdue again, in about 3 hours would be optimal for me ;-)
Edit: btw I have switched the p2pool node meanwhile (but still kept the same bitcoin address), this is possible because switching the node on the fly does not induce any penalty at all.

A brain wallet pass phrase can be created **once** and then the attacker can just scan the stream of new incoming tx in real time until its used for the first time. 
The attacker can simultaneously watch millions or billions of pre-generated brain wallets at virtually **no computational cost** in real time and steal the funds immediately if someone happens to come up with the same brain wallet that is already on the attackers list.
With something like gmail on the other hand, even if I had a list of millions of gmail passords that might be used in the future I would still need to try to log in with **each** of them and I would have to do this periodically again and again to catch all the ones that are not yet used but might be used next month and this is computationally expensive and slow. There is no real time stream of gmail logins I could scan offline in realtime to wait for one of my pre-generated logins to appear, the only way to hack into an online account is to actually try to log in to the remote server and this is slow (millions of times slower than just comparing a few bytes in RAM) and it will also alarm the server owner, you cannot do it secretly, it will generate a lot of noise (suspicious traffic).

Do you have reason to believe someone is explicitly targeting you (someone close to you spying on you, some government agency got interested in you, laptop was routinely searched on the airport customs in some backroom, etc.) or is this more a general concern about untargeted malware that might have been accidentally installed by yourself?
If you believe there is no targeted operation against you specifically and you just want to generally improve security then its usually enough to just avoid using an operating sytem with known bad reputation and horrible track record (such as Windows) that is the prime target of every malware on this planet and instead use something that is harder to infect and usually not targeted by the average mass malware. For example install Linux and stay with their software repository for installing stuff, if you want it even more secure then do not use it for web browsing, email, games, etc. do not install any software from dubious sources.
Sometimes this is impractical because you need to get other work done on your PC that would need you to break these rules, then get second PC or Laptop (cheap old one for $50 is enough) and install a lightweight Linux distribution on it such as Lubuntu (lightweight because it does not need much RAM or other resources, so you can use a really old cheap laptop).
Since you will not use this separate machine for anything other than bitcoin it is next to impossible to be infected with keyloggers unless someone else has physical access to it while you are absent and if someone really had physical access to it he could implant (and 3 months later remove again) virtually any kind of spy equipment or spy software it would not even matter whether its offline or online.
Short version: You can't 100% protect against it but you can make it much harder. And you will already make it pretty damn hard if you just stop making it easy.

do the following two tests, first: (offline-PC)
  * "File" -&gt; "new/restore"
  * choose a file name, call it "test1"
  * click "restore from seed"
  * enter the seed from above
  * choose a password
  * observe that on the receive tab the first 5 addresses are like the ones i wrote above. Of course all balances are 0 and will ever be because this is only created for demonstration purpose and not actually used.
  * click "wallet" -&gt; "master public key", observe that the MPK that is displayed is identical to the one shown above
Now the second test (online-PC):
* click "file" -&gt; "new/restore"
* call it "test2"
* choose "create watching only wallet"
* paste the MPK from above into the box
* observe that again the addresses are exactly identical.
* observe that in the title bar at the end it says "[watching-only]"
* observe that you cannot use the menu item "wallet" -&gt; "seed" (because its seedless watch only)
Can you reproduce these steps? If yes then try to make the same with a new seed. Seed on the offline PC and "create watch only" on the online PC.

The problem is for someone who has not much clue about computers is they are often (almost always) completely unable to see the direct connection between some random app they have installed last week (and already forgotten) and the bad things that happen on their computer tomorrow. Often they do not even see that it happened on their own computer at all and instead think their online wallet or exchange account was hacked when in reality it was their own computer that was compromised. So very often they do not learn anything and continue to make the same mistakes.

There are two kinds of regulation: The abusive kind of regulation that protects monopolies and disallows competition and the good kind that disallows monopolies from taking over the entire infrastructure.
Some systems are self regulating on their own and don't need interference and cannot be corrupted at all (like for example the Bitcoin network) and many other systems are designed in a way that makes them slowly gravitate towards a structure of centralized monopoly, sometimes also with the help of wrong (probably corrupt) regulatory laws (like for example the banking system (and soon also the entire communication infrastructure)).
Net neutrality is regulation of the **good** kind. It would prevent any monopolies forming that end up controlling the communication infrastructure of an entire country.
If there exists **any** justification for something like a government to exist then this is it. It is is to enforce that no single entity or cartel will be allowed to buy the **entire infrastructure** of an entire country and execute total control over it. It must protect the infrastructure. If you believe that this is not needed then you are essentially saying there is no need for any government at all. Is this what you are saying?

No, its everyone's job. Imagine 51% of the miners would begin creating coins out of thin air, if not the entire network of users (nodes) would refuse these blocks as invalid and just ignore them then the miners alone would be able to change the rules. But since they are required to create formally valid blocks and only include valid transactions or otherwise the entire network would refuse them (because all nodes are verifying all newly mined blocks for correctness) they are limited in the amount of damage they can do.
And you would also help people like me who occasionally use their Android Wallet (Schildbach) which connects to 4 full nodes in a somewhat parasitic way in order to leech a few block headers and transactions from the network every now and then but cannot give anything back because it simply does not have a copy of all blocks.
There is no direct monetary reward for you, only the indirect benefit of knowing that you are contributing a useful service to the network you ultimately depend on. Like voting in a democracy for example.

These rights are not **given** by the government, these are natural rights of all human beings. Nowhere is written that these rights are merely "given" to people by a government, it has been established as a fact that these rights are universally valid for all human beings, no matter were they come from or where they live or what government they have.
The only role any government can have here at all (and the very purpose of a government) is to make sure that nobody will try to violate these rights of its people. The governments do not give these rights nor are they allowed to take them away, their only job is to protect them. 
Like a security guard you hire to protect something that belongs to you, he did not give that something to you and he may not take it away, his only job is to protect it.

Wouldn't it have been much more robust, without the need for calibration of the amplitude if you just had used FSK modulation like the old acoustic couplers in the 80's and a low baud rate of maybe 300 Baud because the files are very small?

Multibit does not create change addresses. It will only reuse the already existing addresses. 
The only time you need a new backup is if you **manually** created new addresses. The way I do it is to create a whole bunch of addresses at once, then make a backup. If I need a new receiving address I just use one of those reserve addresses I made and give it a different label, so I don't need to create new addresses and new backups all the time.

So how would this present itself to the user from the user interface perspective? This is probably what most readers want to know first (how to use it) before then later diving deeper into the topic (how is it implemented).
For example a normal pay-to-pubkeyhash transaction (leaving out all details behind the scenes that the wallet does on its own) presents itself to the user as follows: user enters receive address, user enters amount, user clicks send button, done.
How would this be used (all possible scenarios, sending money from local wallet to this web service, withdrawing or sending money from this webservice, withdrawing the money to the local desktop wallet app in case the web service goes down) for example when the user has a local desktop wallet like MultiBit (or Bitcoin or Electrum) if it were implemented in the most user friendly and least confusing way?

If you buy then you pay 0.55% of the BTC after you bought it and then when you sell it again you pay again 0.55% of the USD after you sold it. 
This means for a full roundtrip you pay 1.1%. This means you must at least sell 1.1% higher than you have bought. If you buy at $100 you must sell at $101.1 to avoid a loss.
Additionally you need to keep an eye on the current bid and ask values because that are the prices your orders are executed against. Ask is always a bit higher than bid and also it might not contain the full amount of BTC you want to buy, so it might go even higher (to the next higher ask in the book) while filling your order. Same applies to selling at bid, it might go even lower if not the full amount is available at the highest bid. Always keep a close eye on the order book. Use a trading client software (such as goxtool, highly recommended) that will show you reliable realtime orderbook data while you are trading.

This website is great but I cannot expand any of the outputs, they always show up as "unused outpoint" or "unclaimed", colored in red.

Each node validates all transactions. It checks whether the coins that are to be transferred are actually there (not already otherwise spent) and that it is properly signed by the sender and is otherwise a formally valid transaction but it does **not** care who the owner of the destination address is or whether this owner even exists because there is no way to find out. The miner (after verifying all the above) just writes into the next mined block "send x from aaaa to bbbb" (overly simplified), it does not care what bbbb actually is, it only checks that the transaction is signed with a key that belongs to aaaa.
Only when the owner of bbbb eventually arrives and wants to move his coins he has to sign a transaction (send x from bbbb to cccc) and then it has to be signed with a key that belongs to bbbb.
Its actually a giant database that only consists of "transfer x from a to b". Only the x and the "from" are verified, it needs to be signed with a key that belongs to the from-address. The "to" is never checked. So its perfectly possible to send coins to a "black hole", an address for which nobody knows the private key, so they can never appear in the "from"-part of a transaction again because without a private key for the from address nobody can make a valid signature for that transaction.

Coins cannot disappear that way. Either the transaction took place (mined into the global ledger) or it didn't, either the coins are still where they were initially or they are at their destination. This is atomic, its either/or, no in-between. It either transacted or it didn't.
Transactions can stay unconfirmed for a while, they can not be broadcasted correctly and disappear but all this is only **temporary**, in the end what counts is whether a transaction is mined into a block (moving the coins from A to B) or the transaction is not mined (coins didn't move). If in doubt then look at blockchain.info (or blockexplorer.com or blockr.io or any other of these info sites) to see the one and only authoritative state of the block chain and whether the transaction exists or does not exist.

Was not my intention. I rather wanted to mention the observation I have made. I am noticing such things out of scientific curiosity (well, not really strict science, just curiosity). I believe there is a correlation between suddenly rising price and sudden increase in new users and this time it seemed obvious to me that the new user number is **lagging** behind price at least one week. This means they did not follow the charts directly, they waited until it indirectly came to their attention (news, friends, blogs) with one week delay which seems plausible to me. 
And I also expect a positive feedback loop that will further increase the price (this is what I was referring to with the "to-the-moon"-season), this is the time I am trying to identify early (and others should look for these symptoms too) because price always overshoots and it would be a wise decision to put the own buying on hold during this time (noobs cannot be convinced to do this, otherwise the market would not behave like that in the first place) and wait until the market has cooled down again.

The most interesting orders are always the lowest sell order and the highest buy order, in this case (your screen shot) its the 3.9BTC that are up for sale at 629.188 which would be your price if you wanted to buy and the 0.47BTC at 628 which would be what you get if you sell. Of course you can only sell or buy as much as there is offered at this price, if you buy or sell more then it would fill the rest with the next higher or lower order and so on.
Alternatively (recommended if you are not in a hurry) instead of taking other peoples orders you can place your own orders at more favorable prices and then wait until someone else comes along who is in a hurry and fills your order.
For example if you wanted to buy 1BTC you could place a buy order just one cent above the 628 order and then you would wait until someone comes along who wants to sell immediately and he would take this order. Then you would have bought at 628.01 instead of 629.188. You can also place a buy order at 620 and wait much longer (days, weeks), eventually a big whale comes along and dumps enough coins to fill all other orders above you and reach your price and fill your order.

Since you created a new wallet now you are of course looking at a new empty wallet, it is expected to have no bitcoins in it since its new.
But don't worry. You also have your old wallet file somewhere, it is just currently not opened. You need to find that file and open it in Multibit.
You said you have made backups. Can you search these backups for certain individual files only and restore individual files only instead of restoring the entire backup at once? I guess this should be possible. Look for a file with the file extension
    .wallet
look for all files with that extension, move them to a folder of your choice (you can rename them if there are more than one, just leave the file name extension .wallet)
Then start Multibit and open the first wallet file you found, if its the wrong one then open the next one until you found it.
From then on make sure you always know where your .wallet file is located, make a separate copy of that file on an external harddisk or flash drive or better even multiple copies on multiple flash drives, never forget where you keep them so you quickly find them when you need them.
And don't forget to make new backups when you create new receiving addresses. Unlike bitcoin-core it will not automatically create new addresses without asking, so there cannot be any surprise, best practice is to make a whole bunch of new addresses as reserve all at once and then make your backup copies of the .wallet file.

This is different from a criminal ponzi where the organizers do NOT publish the fact that it really is only a game of financial musical chairs and there will be losers at the end and instead fraudulently proclaim a profitable business model and make it look like an investment.

Artificial terms like "personal wallet" only introduce more confusion. There are actually only wallets (-&gt; cash) and bank accounts (-&gt; book money). Many of these bank accounts call themselves "wallets" but they really aren't. They are bank accounts and an account is not a wallet. A wallet holds cash and an account holds numbers while the cash is elsewhere.
Coinbase : Bank account with book money (and all consequences this implies). Recommended only for conversion BTC/USD, then you should immediately withdraw to your wallet.
Blockchain.info : wallet with cash, but more dangerous than any other wallet because keys are regularly moved halfway around the planet and it has remote access from everywhere. Not recommended.
Electrum, Multibit, Bitcoin-Qt, Armory, Schildbach, Mycelium : Wallet with cash (and no remote access, strictly confined to the local machine, therefore removing a lot of possible attack vectors).
I recommend Electrum.

They suck at math. The price increase for 2013 was $750/$13=57, so "3-4 times more than the one this year" would be between 171 and 228 and this would bring us to around $128,250 ... $171,00
This is too optimistic.
I guess the price increase will **not be as high as last year** (if this year is like 2013 it would bring us to $10,000), I expect it to be lower, still going up but not as extreme as this year, some serious corrections between the rallies are very likely.

By the time the average Joe &amp; Jane are even beginning to think about using bitcoin there will be a way to present it to the customers in a convenient way. Dealerships and exchanges that target the end user will denote it in appropriate smaller units. The wallet software today already has support to switch the denomination on the fly and covers a wide range of possible denominations (BTC, mBTC, µBTC), the prices will be denominated so that it is most convenient, that it will produce the fewest amount of zeros on either side of the decimal. 
All this will happen naturally, you don't have to demand it now or try to formally define it or even worse try to force it onto the people now, people will just use what they deem most usable and this will naturally establish itself.

replace the folder with a **symbolic link** that points to a different folder on a different hdd. 
This is a standard practice on most other OS to gain more flexibility in the disk and folder layout even when certain software expects their folders in certain places only. For some reason this very useful technique was less well known in Windows, maybe because older microsoft file systems did not support it and the tools to create them were not integrated into windows explorer but since newer versions of NTFS it works just fine and people should make use of it to elegantly solve such kind of problems.
note that the syntax of the mlink command on windows is refreshingly different from what one would expect, note the order of arguments:
    mklink [options] &lt;Link&gt; &lt;File&gt;
while you might be used to the ln command on all other operating systems where it is
    ln [options] &lt;File&gt; &lt;Link&gt;
which is in perfect harmony with
    cp [options] &lt;File&gt; &lt;Destination&gt;
    mv [options] &lt;File&gt; &lt;Destination&gt;
Microsoft did this intentionally to set themselves apart from the rest of the world by introducing some subtle irregularity to underline their individuality, to bring some variety into otherwise boring and easy to memorize semantics. It always reminds you that you are dealing with something special, something extraordinary that does not want to be too easy to see through. They want it to be more like a woman than a machine.

Just out of curiosity: Why do you prefer it over Electrum when you now see its huge disadvantage, namely that its actually of no practical use at all when you need it most? 
With Electrum you could have set up an extemporary watch-only wallet within 5 minutes basically anywhere (friend's computer or elsewhere) for the purpose of making one quick transaction.
Edit: Maybe this is an idea for a web service: Someone could provide a website that can act as an ad-hoc watch-only-sign-only wallet for situations like these. It would ask for the MPK (compatible with Armory **and** Electrum), then query the balance online, let the user make an unsigned transaction and save it to USB.

This is especially useful because the old blockchain.info importer in Multibit turned out to be broken and was removed. I wrote a new one from scratch, the result is wallet-key-tool
if you start it there are load and save buttons, in the file dialog you can select the file format. Right mouse button in the key list also has a few more useful options for managing keys or moving between wallets.
Basically you should be able click load, select the aes.json file, enter the password and then you see a list of your keys. You can query balances with right mouse button-&gt;fetch balance and you can save the list in a different format, for example Multibit wallet and then open that with multibit.

Mike should talk to the Tor people, they also did not 100% solve this problem but they made it much harder by using entry guards and nodes slowly gaining trust by having long uptimes and serving a lot of traffic to a lot of people before they are allowed to become an entry guard. The fact that a node has been promoted to entry guard status is recorded in the global consensus. Individual nodes are recognized by their unique cryptographic signature.
The problem with Tor is their global consensus is a centralized fixed consortium of servers run by the Tor project. Bitcoin consensus is the block chain. If we had something like entry guard nodes they would need to be elected and recorded in the block chain. 
Mike should direct his energy towards thinking about such solutions and not waste his time and endanger the trustworthiness of Bitcoin as a whole by trying to implement centralized authorities. 
**There is only one authority** that could ever be allowed to issue stuff like passports or certifications or hold elections and publish the results **and this is the block chain!**
How about this:
**proof-of-uptime**: instead of proving a sacrifice how about rewarding long running nodes or nodes that have relayed a lot of transactions for a long time with colored Satoshis to a dedicated address of this node. Upon connect the node would sign a challenge-response with this key/address and the other node can then look up the "trust"-level and the age of this address in the block chain.

They could be ordered to orphan any block that mines the tx and in order to "help" competing pools they would give them the list of tx to exclude too so other pools can filter them too and avoid being orphaned. 
All large pools would participate (because the alternative would be going out of business) and the smaller pools and solo miners that don't know which tx to exclude would either mine only empty blocks from now on to avoid getting orphaned or go out of business.

When was the last time you installed any type of operating system on a new PC?
My last one was 2 months ago. I bought 2 brand new AMD Desktop systems, on one of them I installed windows 7, on the other one Kubuntu 12.04.
Windows was a nightmare, as usual. It took me almost a whole day until it was finished and usable, Hardware support almost non-existent, It didn't even recognize the ethernet adapter! The next day I installed Kubuntu on the other machine: installation took 20 minutes, it was so simple even my grandmother could have done it, it needed ZERO user intervention and after it was finished every device was fully supported and working.

Most software that needs huge ranges of numerical values numbers from the user like for example SPICE simulations (LTSpice, ngspce) also accept the "u" for our imperial friends instead of the "µ" so when you want to write 33 micro henry you can just write 33u and it will interpret that number literal as 0.000033

I am specifically asking for step 2
In the video they show someone clicking on an ebay item. And then some magic happens, without further explanation.
I would like to know what "magic" exactly is happening here behind the scenes, what does this bookmarklet do in my browser? I am logged in with my own ebay account. Will they make **my** browser order it through **my ebay account** but pay it with **their** credit card? Or with their PayPal (if PayPal even allows this)? Or will they just scan the item URL and send this information home to their servers and then try to buy it with **their** ebay account and give my address for shipping? Which name is then on the contract of purchase, what if I need refund or warranty if I am technically only a shipping address and not the buyer of the item?
What happens with items in online shops that have non standard or heavily modified shopping cart checkout html forms, how can their bookmarklet parse it automatcally and correctly? Do they have 1000 Chinese workers doing all the orders manually?
I would want to know whats going on here before I decide to use it. I might need this service soon but before that can happen I want to know how it works (how it works, not how to use it) because I do not see how this can technically (and practically and legally) work at all.

* Why don't they say **which banks** are affected so one can know about it before sending money?
If it were clearly known beforehand then it would not cause so much anger among users but you [Kraken] cannot say: "Congratulations, you are verified Tier 2, now go ahead and deposit and trade freely" and then after receiving the deposit you surprisingly change the terms and conditons and suddenly require Tier 3 and a half.

Its a matter of definition. I suggest avoiding this term entirely, especially if you can not agree on a common definition.
There are at least "offline", "online" and "web" wallets and everybody defines them differently, some make no difference between "online" and "web", some others define everything as "online" if its not a paper wallet or "never-seen-the-internet-before" offline-signing electrum or armory, and all these categories can have even more sub-categories.
These categories are all too one-dimensional, they cannot describe the entire spectrum.
* Multibit needs a connection to the internet, just like Bitcoin-Qt (so in some sense its online)
* Multibit stores the private keys in a local encrypted container on the own HDD, they never touch the internet, just like in Bitcoin-Qt (so your **keys** are offline)
* Multibit connects to other nodes just like Bitcoin-Qt but unlike the reference client it does not download all blocks completely, it downloads only block headers and heavily filtered and pruned block data that contain only the tx it is interested in. Therefore it can not help and contribute in verifying other tx and it cannot serve other clients. But this also makes it very lightweight and fast while still being completely independent of specialized servers. Of all alternative light wallets it is the most **independent** one because it only needs the core Bitcoin p2p network, no 3rd party servers or other specialized or centralized infrastructure.

What is this confusing "tonal", "TBC" (inhaled too much THC?), "Bongo-Bongo"-nonsense about? 
This wiki page does **not** seem to be a useful resource for someone looking for an overview of "units **used** in bitcoin". This wiki page only contains a confusing table of some arbitrary numbers in no particular order, some funny looking words and abbreviations whose meaning remains in the dark and no explanation at all. It looks like some kind of joke, probably some kind of persiflage about the imperial unit system with all its crazy conversion factors.
The units currently **used** in bitcoin are
* 1 Bitcoin (1 BTC)
* 1 Millibitcoin (1 mBTC = 1/1000 BTC)
* 1 Microbitcoin, sometimes also called "bit" (1 µBTC = 1/1000 mBTC = 1/100,000 BTC)
* 1 Satoshi (1/100 µBTC = 1/100,000,000 BTC)
the first two (BTC and mBTC) currently are the most practical units for everyday usage and for amounts occurring in every day life and are therefore most often used: 1 mBTC = 0.35 US$ (as of this week)

Fortunes could be made. Or lost.
Everybody will have two wallets with incompatible coins (Bitcoin-A and Bitcoin-B), each initially filled with the exact same amount of coin. If one of the two does not immediately lose all support then exchanges like Cryptsy will begin to allow users to trade between these two coins to establish an exchange rate. People will begin selling their A-coins for B-coins (or the other way around) in an attempt to almost double their coins, this will ultimately make one of them collapse quickly (it will show everybody where the majority is) and half of the users who tried to trade them lose everything and the other half will double their coins and the ones who didn't try to trade will keep their old amount of coins and will regret not having sold their A-coins for B-coins immediately when exchange rate was still close to parity.

This is not enough time for a n00b (or even an average bitcoin user) to setup all prerequisites to perform a successful double spend. I wouldn't even know which wallet software would be suitable for this task (which lets me quickly import a key and allows me to set my own fees and allows me to send a doublespend transaction) because performing a double spend is not part of the every day bitcoin routine. I would probably waste 10 minutes to convert it to multibit import format, only to find out I cannot set the fee there, then I would waste another 10 minutes setting up a new empty electrum wallet to do the same and if this doesn't work (it probably won't because the electrum servers would know about the unconfirmed tx and not allow it) then there is not much time left to learn how to navigate through the horribly unintuitive blockchain.info UI and find the hidden options (if BI even allows one to do double spends). By that time the 30 minutes would be up already.

Since every single node (every wallet, every merchant, every payment provider) will verify every incoming block against **all** rules (the old original rules) it will immediately discard these invalid blocks as if they were not even existing at all, all it can see and use is the longest chain of valid blocks and that will always be the original chain that satisfies all rules. Even if the fake chain is much longer, it will just completely ignore it.
The miners do not make the rules, the majority of users decides about the rules and the miners have to obey. Whatever the miners decide to do, it must still fulfill all formal protocol rules or else their blocks will go straight to nirvana and they wasted their time and resources.

This one incident had nothing to do with Tor. They set up a fake website and then served some sort of malware to the visitors of the site and exploited the visitor's firefox (or whatever browser they used that was vulnerable) and the malfunctioning web browser then somehow phoned home with compromising information about its user.
There are ways to prevent this. For example the easiest one for not so tech savvy people is to just boot the tails live cd when planning to to do super secret stuff over Tor. It makes sure everything is configured for maximum security by default, no way for the user to accidentally forget an important configuration option. And there is no compromising information about the user inside the running tails session that could give them any clue, even if they manage to take over and remote-control your web browser entirely. All they will see is a standard tails environment that looks exactly like any other and there is no external network adapter except the one that is tunneled through tor. And if you shut down your computer after you are done (or just pull the plug if you hear the noise of someone kicking in your door) it will leave absolutely no traces and no evidence of what you did on your machine.

"spent" here means the BTC that were sent to this address have since been moved further, they are no longer lying at this address, the receiver took them and moved them to somewhere else.
Moving BTC away from an address (to another address) is usually always called "spending" in the context of Bitcoin, even if its only due to moving/reorganizing/consolidating between different addresses of the same wallet of the same user. Since from the outside (without knowledge to whom the addresses belong) the transaction of BTC between addresses of the same wallet does not look any different than a transaction between different people its alwas just called "spending". This usage of the word "spending" here is only a purely technical term on a very low protocol level, it does not have the economical meaning of "spending money on/for something". Here it just means "this amount was used as input to another transaction, its no longer available at this address"

you need root and then look in the /data/data/ folder. Every installed app has its own folder there to keep its private data. These folders are named after the java namespaces of the apps, so you will see odd folder names like /data/data/com.google.whatever or org.something, it won't sometimes be immediately obvious which folder belongs to which app but it should be possible to identify them, if you have root access then you could try to make a backup copy of this entire /data/data/ folder onto your PC and then search it for any remains of the FreeOPT app.

And these coins actually don't "belong to silkroad", they belong to the **users** of silkroad in their accounts and escrow accounts. They are also not 100% "proceeds of crime", only a part of them, other parts belong to users who had deposited funds there without actually having bought (or having the intention to buy) anything illegal or anything at all.
They have all server logs, they could very well determine which users have bought or sold which items and which users haven't done anything illegal at all, they could determine that amount to the last Satoshi exact by running a few queries on the database! But instead they choose to take it all, regardless of the circumstances (because there are some absurd laws in the USA that legalize such kind of theft from innocent bystanders).

Will paypal even allow this or could they initiate a chargeback because of "bitcoin" and then 2 days later the police comes knocking at my door looking for the goods that I purchased but did not pay for?) or credit card - are they using their credit card with *their* billing address to pay for it and then have it shipped to me at my address?

nothing is "safe". Its all relative.
But KeePassX is recommended because its at least a lot "safer" than writing down and then losing or than memorizing and forgetting, etc.
KeePassX can be configured for really CPU heavy key stretching, millions of rounds so it takes one minute for every attempt on a decent 6-core, so your master password does not need to be too complicated. I'm using it for everything from banking PIN to Electrum seed and have the keepass database synced across all my devices and additionally backed up on a few different flash drives.
But of course if you have a keylogger or similar malware on your computer then you can essentially forget doing *anything* with sensible data on that machine, then absolutely nothing you do on this computer can ever be considered "safe".

The advantage is you don't need a credit card company anymore. Payments go directly from A to B. Your money is held and controlled by you and not by someone else on your behalf. You have more control over your own money and nobody else has any business telling you what you are allowed or not allowed to do with it.


Only in USA. In Europe for example the average consumer does not have a credit card. We have bank cards for payment at POS terminals or ATM (chip card with 4 digit PIN) but these are not credit cards, they are directly connected to your bank account. Most purchases by average consumer are done with cash (we do not suffer from this strange cash-phobia as Americans do, we are using cash a lot).

yes, of course. Thats what bitcoin is all about in the first place. You actually were never supposed to store them with third parties anyways.
Here is what I recommend:
* Install Electrum
* write down the seed (12 words it gives you) and keep them in a safe place, they will enable you to restore your wallet even if your computer explodes and your house burns to the ground (store the paper with the seed underground and water proof)
* choose a secure passphrase
This should be enough. Most thefts happen through weak passwords in web wallets, compromised email accounts, compromised dropbox, etc., all that can't happen with electrum because you don't move weak backup files halfway around the planet or have enabled remote access from Russia only because always everything accessible from everywhere is hip today. If you use Electrum you keep it on your own computer and only there, this is a much smaller attack surface. If you apply reasonable security to your computer that should be pretty safe.
For larger amounts I would use Electrum cold storage (seed offline + watch only online), this is pretty easy, you just need an old $100 Laptop or any other old unused computer you have lying around somewhere, you don't even need it all the time, you only need it once to create it and only later once you want to spend it again.

I think you identified the problem already, you need to know what a command line is, you need to take a step back and try to understand how a program is actually started. when a program is started it can be given a set of arguments or options that influence its behavior, its defaults, etc or otherwise tell it how to start or what to do imediately after start or anything (depends on the program and its purpose).
You can start a program from the command line and there you also give it the arguments. See my other posting.
You can start it with the click on some kind of starter icon that has been installed along with the program then ultimately that starter has some preset command line options it supplies to the program (or often no arguments or options at all). Your goal is to figure out how to configure the arguments and options that will be given to the program when you click the armory icon or how to make a new starter icon that contains just the right options and arguments you need.
It takes some time to understand it all, take yourself this time. It pays out, you will need it more often once you have it understood.

Yes, but pushing the code back and forth across this border will expose you to their stupid crypto export legislations and might make you a "criminal" just for pushing and pulling there (depending on how crazy they interpret their laws) and they could also serve an NSL to github to force them to log your passwords, log your IP addresses, serve you trojans through the website, commit small changes that look like they are from one of your core-developers and might slip through, serve trojanized binaries to targeted end users through the download section, etc. 
I would just host the main repository somewhere in Europe and totally avoid this confrontation, strictly exclude any person, any service that is subject to US laws and therefore in latent danger of receiving an NSL to come **anywhere** closer than 1000 miles to the development. BerliOS in Germany for example would be a good choice, maybe Switzerland has similar services as well. 
There are hosters in Europe who would rather incite a cross-atlantic diplomatic shitstorm of epic proportions, knowing that the law is on their side, than silently bowing down in servile submission to some 3-letter agency from the other side of the planet.

    * run your own P2Pool node and mine on that

And this is exactly the first thing that needs to be written in **bold** letters in the p2pool documentation and on the wiki page about p2pool and on the first couple of websites that come up when googling for p2pool.
Currently **to a n00b** it looks like this:
* p2pool is just some ordinary pool and it charges 2%, no thanks.
* oh, wait, there is something else with the same name (how confusing) but this looks horribly complicated to set up, maybe after Christmas when I have some time.
If there exists something like a p2pool community whose members are the ones who control these websites that come up after a google search for p2pool they should agree on some n00b-friendly introduction like above that explains which parts of the p2pool network there exist and what options there exist for an ordinary miner.

Strictly speaking the µ is part of the number literal and is by convention placed after the number. Its not a standalone unit, it is merely a dimensionless multiplication factor. In all other areas except the Dollar and in **all** areas outside of USA the unit is always written after the number too (for example 10€ "ten Euro"), so it always ends up between number and Unit, often also merged with the unit itself (µm = "micrometer", sometimes this fusion of prefix and unit even gets its own name: "micron", "mü") because mathematically the order doesn't matter, the multiplication is commutative.
The Dollar is just an unlucky exception from the general rule and its strange placement in front is not relevant or often not even known outside the USA. It should not be regarded as a standard, only as a curious exception that will soon be irrelevant.

This a thousand times!
When I first hered about p2pool I googled around, expecting some easy top-down explanation but I ended up at some public p2pool nodes that displayed a lot of stuff that did not fit into what I **thought** I had understood so far and I was even more confused. Eventually found some documentation of the software itself and again it began with a lot of convoluted implementation details in a very unstructured manner instead of an easy gentle top-down introduction first explaining the meaning of all the different parts with which the miner will be confronted (including a bold warning that these p2pool.info guys that happen to be on top of the google results just stole the name to confuse users) and how these parts all relate to each other. This should also be explained with the help of some graphics showing the topology and maybe all the public p2pool nodes should also have some easy to understand explanation with a graphic explaining the topology, a red circle: "you are here", "you could also go there", etc.
Just a few hours ago someone mentioned in another thread: "but p2pool charges 2%!". This is exactly what happens when someone first stumbles over some p2pool-pool that happens to abuse his google search rank to misinform users, charges 2%, makes it confusingly appear as if this were THE official p2pool and no mention of  the p2pool network itself, no explanation what it actually is about, which part of the entire p2pool thing the user is currently looking at, what it means and what his alternatives regarding p2pool are.

This depends on whom you ask. Some will say "to the moon", some will say "much less than today". Like in any other market, if all market participants would agree that its "guaranteed" to be worth much more than what is traded today then the price would instantly explode until the point is reached where *not* all traders agree anymore and you are again confronted with half of the answers saying "up" and the other half saying "down".
There can never be an agreement amongst all traders regarding the future direction of price. The only exception is when all agree it is its dead, then the price will be zero and remain there forever.

You either need the .wallet file or the .key file. 
Each of them contains the complete list of private bitcoin keys that define your wallet and let you access the bitcoins, they are just a different file format, the .wallet can directly be opened (file-&gt;open wallet) and the .key can be imported into another wallet (so you would create a new empty wallet and then import the .key into it). 
The advantage of .wallet is you can just open and use it in multibit (without needing import, in multibit you can quickly open and use multiple wallet files at the same time), the advantage of .key is you can use it to merge two wallets into one by importing one wallet's key export into another wallet.
.key contains only the absolutely bare minimum of what is needed to restore access to the bitcoins, (thats why it is much smaller) and .wallet also contains a lot of metadata, the transaction history, etc so it doesn't need to rescan the block chain after closing and reopening it, etc., thats why it can be several megabytes large.

You don't have to do this. Its only because of the way many people spend their keys, they import the key into a hot wallet and then it is by definition not cold anymore. 
Also when doing it with software that was never designed for and never meant to handle paper wallets there will be this change address problem that needs to be taken care of.
If you use **offline** software on a permanently (always!) **offline** machine to sign a transaction from a paper wallet and the software is aware (or designed in such a way) that change needs to go back where the money came from then you can spend partial amounts and after this the key will be just as cold as it was before.
If you use hot wallet software that has explicit paper wallet spending support such as Mycelium (very much recommended, look for the "cold storage" menu option in Mycelium) then you also don't need to care about change addreses and can spend partial amounts without any worries, the only downside some people might suggest in this case is after this the key might be compromised if your Android device was infected with wallet stealing malware but I have yet to see any confirmed report of the existence of such Wallet stealing malware on Android, so far there has not yet been any sighting of such a thing during all these years and its relatively easy to keep an android device clean of malware, just do not install any apps (except the wallet) at all after factory reset.

If Armory is too heavy (its online component needs the entire block chain, so to spend from cold storage you will first need to sync the online machine for a loooong time if you don't use it every day) you should also look at Electrum. Similar to Armory it also provides cold storage with seed and master public key and an online wath-only wallet, the difference is it is much more lightweight, both computers can both be really old hardware and don't need much disk space, the watch-only wallet is ready to show the balance or prepare a transaction within seconds even if you did not use it for many years. The downside is it is missing some of the more advanced features of Armory, but this also means it is less confusing for non-experts. 
Security of Electrum is essentially the same as Armory if you keep the offline machine strictly offline.

And on top of that it also has all necessary properties that are needed for a medium to be able to become money (all monetary properties of Gold, each of them in even better quality and some useful additional properties (such as being immaterial, pure information) on top of that). 
And that is why it will become money.

Yes, this is a severe design flaw of Multibit but I guess they won't fix it anymore now because it would cause even more confusion and all old howtos would stop to work.
the appdata folder (and the Library/Application Support folder on Mac) are not meant for user files (files that a user is supposed to navigate to, create or open with a file dialog), these hidden folders are only meant for files the application will manage on its own and are not supposed to be ever handled by the user.
User files on the other hand (files the user can create/open/close/rename/move freely around himself) like the wallet file in Multibit (also the wallet file in Electrum (Electrum has the same design flaw)) belong into the documents folder (not sure what this would be on a Mac since I don't own one but I'm sure it has the equivalent of this folder too).

I'm surprised. I was under the impression that **every** Qt application is accessible by default if no custom widgets are used and if the latter is the case then the devs should just implement the needed interfaces for these widgets and they would be accessible too.
The Bitcoin devs should have a look at this document:
After all they decided to switch from Wx to Qt because some Qt fanboys appeared on the scene and claimed Qt were superior to any other toolkit in existence in every regard and they themselves were extremely versed in Qt (and UI design in general and they had egos as big as aircraft carriers and insulted every other technology and every other framework) and promised to make Bitcoin a better application by rewriting the GUI with Qt.
The "experts in UI design" claim was quickly proven wrong at the first release of the Qt version, they were really just average programers with average skills and no clue of good UI design.
While it **is** undoubtedly true that Qt is an extremely good toolkit, it seems that it is still possible for unskilled programmers with too big egos to mess it up.

many modern desktop environments (for example KDE can do this and iirc there is even some official standard and framework for this) allow you to define customized content types based on the file extension. Almost like  in Windows. People just click the file and let the desktop environment decide what to do (and this can be whatever they have configured) instead of using file in the console.
But it doesn't matter anyways. This is also not a discussion about file extensions, this is about clicking without thinking (and also about dangerous configurations) and it does not matter whether its a jar with the extension .jar or a jar with the extension .jpg, if you have configured to open java archives with "java -jar" on a mouse click then it will do it.

Someone could make a strategy plugin for one of the popular trading clients that support plugins (such as for example goxtool), the plugin could post the relevant information in an easily parsable format to an IRC channel and/or would be able to follow a particular user in this channel and automatically copy his trades.
I have once written such a thing for MT4 (only the broadcasting of trades to irc, not the following of other users and it was only a fun project), but I'm too busy with other stuff that I'm not likely to do it again, also I would not use it myself, so there is not much motivation to maintain such a plugin.
Maybe you should talk to the folks at zulutrade.com, they have the motivation to work on things like this (but they don't do it with client side plugins, they do it by being granted access (by you) directly to the exchange/borker API which requires some trust and maybe some exchanges would not like this kind of 3rd party access.
So I suggest you find someone who writes a fully client side solution or plugin to existing trading clients.

Each of them contains all private keys which is all you need to restore full access to all your coins after your computer was damaged/crashed/broken/whatever.
Each of them will be encrypted if you use the password protection option.
The .key file only contains the keys, the .wallet file additionally also contains some more metadata but essentially all this is optional, the keys are all you need, so no matter which one of them you backed up, you are safe.
The key file is an openssl encrypted WIF dump file, the same format that is also used by Schildbach (Android) and by the Bitcoin-core "dumpwallet" command, so you could theoretically use this to import the keys relatively easily into bitcoin-core and it can also be imported into a bunch of other wallet applications, its a quasi standard file format.
There is also an .info file that contains all the address labels, this is for your convenience only, it belongs to the .wallet but its optional, it doesn't matter if you lose it but its nice and convenient to have it. Its a plain text file.
Regarding the backups: You need a new backup (of either .wallet +.info or .key) whenever you create a new receiving address. Unlike Bitcoin-core Multibit will not automatically create new receiving addresses or change addresses, it will only ever create new ones if you click the "new" button on the "receive" tab.
This means the best way to handle is is to create a whole bunch of new receiving addresses at once in advance, label them for example with the word "new" and then make your backup. Then later if you need a new receiving address, just relabel one of the "new"-addresses. When you are running low on "new"-addresses you let it create a bunch of new ones and make a new backup. Since it is you and nobody else who controls at which time this happens you never have to do it in a hurry and never forget to make a backup, so in this regard its even more fool-proof than Bitcoin-core it doesn't do this in the background, it does it only when you tell it to do so.

You should not have published that personal coinbase address. 
To keep things nicely separated you should set up separate receiving addresses for separate purposes and even generate new addresses for individual payments. If you use a desktop wallet application (Multibit, Electrum (highly recommended)) then you will have complete control over the addresses and their keys and the movement of funds between them, you can setup multiple wallets easily, each of them containing as many addresses as you need and implement your own bookkeeping as you need it on top of that.
Use the coinbase account only for selling/buying USD, after buying you transfer funds out of there immediately to your own wallet (in order to actually take *possession* of the Bitcoins) and send funds to coinbase only when you want to sell and manage all your bitcoin transactions and your private spending with your own desktop wallet application only.

@_date: 2014-05-25 12:30:11
I'm going to try to illustrate it in a way you haven't probably looked at it yet. First lets look at the old way (you still see it recommended very often)
**The traditional way**
    offline,             | 
    keep secure,         |
    never share,         |                
    never lose           |  online
    SECRET               |  PUBLIC
    ------------------------------------------
                         |
    private key 1       --&gt; address 1    
    private key 2       --&gt; address 2
    private key 3       --&gt; address 3
    [...]               --&gt; [...]
                         |
The above is what happens when you make paper wallets
as still often described in the numerous guides, it 
all boils down to creating a SECRET in the secure 
environment and keep it there offline and secure and 
only move the resulting PUBLIC component to the right 
side. In the case of a paper wallets this is the 
resulting bitcoin address.
The downside is that it is incredibly cumbersome to
work with private keys, it is error prone and the
existing software is discouraging you to do it and
rightly so because its actually NOT recommended to
do the above manually, thats why many wallet apps
make it an expert-only option to directly manipulate
the keys and have bold warnings in the user manual.
**Enter HD wallets**
again the above table (you see a pattern, its very
similar, there is a secret and a public component
but they are easier to handle and the wallet apps
offer a convenient user interface to work with!
    offline,             | 
    keep secure,         |
    never share,         |                
    never lose           |  online
    SECRET               |  PUBLIC
    --------------------------------------------
                         |
    seed                --&gt; master public key (MPK)
     |                   |   |
     |                   |   |
     V                   |   V
    private key 1        | address 1
    private key 2        | address 2
    private key 3        | address 3
    [...]                | [...]
                         |
Note the arrows! They show what is generating what.
In the first table every address must be generated
from its own key and you had to handle that and 
keep track of all that manually. Now in the second 
table you only have the seed and the seed generates 
the MPK and everything else (the vertical arrows) 
happen automatically in the application and **this
is how you are supposed to do cold storage 
nowadays**, no more low level messing around with 
individual raw keys.
The old approach
    private key     --&gt;    bitcoin addres
    
with HD wallet it now simply becomes
    seed            --&gt;    MPK
    
Seed and MPK are now the only two things you need 
to handle and all the key generation and address 
generation happens in the wallet app. Its almost
the same concept, just at a higher level: Like
how formerly the private key generated the address 
now the seed generates the MPK. You only need to 
store the seed, the MPK can be generated from the 
seed and all your addresses will be generated
from the MPK.
**Practically this means following procedure:**
  * offline generate seed and MPK with Electrum (or other HD wallet)
  * store the seed safely
  * bring the MPK to the online machine
  * shut down the offline machine, lock it away or even destroy it if you want. If you don't want to sign transactions (spend bitcoins) then you don't need it anymore, you only need the seed.
On the online machine
  * install Electrum (or other HD wallet)
  * enter the MPK (On Electrum it is "File" -&gt; "new" -&gt; "create watch only version of wallet")
  * use the bitcoin addresses it generates to receive money, generate as many receive addresses as you need with a click of the mouse without needing to consult the offline environment or the private seed every time. They are all ultimately derived from the seed but it works automatically, the seed can stay hidden in your deposit box all the time and you can generate thousands of different addresses to receive in the insecure online environment (you could even post the MPK online it wouldn't matter, people could see your money but not touch it) and it can be accessed **only** with knowledge of the seed because it is impossible to follow the arrows in the above table backwards, they are one-way functions.

You can wipe your butt with dollar notes too and you can make global transactions without a third party with bitcoins.
And the jewelry argument is totally ridiculous. You can make jewelry out of everything that looks nice and shiny.


This is not a definition, this is meaningless nonsense that applies to everything. You cannot **quantify** the "intrinsic value" and it even varies with the context and the circumstances but this cannot be quantified either. Its a totally meaningless concept.
If tomorrow morning 42 ounces of gold per square meter would materialize on the entire surface of earth (improbable but not impossible) so that everybody could just pick up some gold from right in front of his feet, as much as he wants, it would still have the **exact same "intrinsic value"** as the day before and you could still make the same jewelry from it but it would immediately become totally meaningless as money and people would **pay** other people to clean the place and and get rid of all the the gold.

blockchain.info is not THE blockchain. Blockchain.info is a commercial enterprise that just ~~stole~~ borrowed the name "blockchain" to confuse the users and trick them into believing it would be something "official". Old marketing trick. 
Since the name "blockchain" only exists as a description of a concept in the protocol (the term "block chain" or "blockchain" was established long before blockchain.info existed to describe the concept of a chain (a linked list) of blocks) and is not legally protected in any way they can just use it for their own commercial purposes and make themselves appear as if they were some kind of official instance or integral part of Bitcoin (and unfortunately many people really believe this!).
I have no idea how to fix this. Maybe we should establish another word for "block chain" when talking about the block chain (the real and only official block chain) and avoid mentioning "blockchain" altogether but I fear its too late now.

you don't type in the seed when creating a watch-only wallet, thats the whole purpose of watch only: it works **without seed!**

Its either doomed to failure if it stagnates here at this early point already (and then also it can't stabilize because then it will be dead already) or adoption will continue to grow further and this inevitably means price will continue to grow rapidly.
OP is expressing hopes of stabilization and my opinion is it can't stabilize at this moment in time at this extremely low market penetration, I believe it **can** stabilize eventually but this will only be when the market penetration will be orders of magnitude larger, this will be the only environment where any hopes of price stabilization can ever be fulfilled and because of the limited supply this can then only be at a much higher price. 
The only other possible outcome I can see is complete failure.

No, it won't use the seed at all, otherwise it would be able to generate private keys and be able to spend the coins. Instead its using what is called "master public key" which can generate the same sequence of addresses only **without** their private keys due to some extremely clever application of the underlying cryptography.

They don't need any BTC themselves.
People who want to sell will deposit their BTC and people who want to buy will deposit their fiat and then they can use the platform to place orders and trade with **each other**.  
The exchange only provides the platform for the traders and does not actually buy or sell themselves, the only thing they may do is charge a small fee for the trades, if they stick to this rule and don't try to enter the speculation game themselves or otherwise expose themselves to BTC/fiat exchange rate risk or do funny things with their customers deposits then they can never get into trouble and never go bankrupt.

Ask other people before you use a service or a program that is new to you. Don't give too much weight to answers that not also provide some intelligent reasoning. Search the forums, you will quickly get a first  impression that can be very telling, you will see whether it has been around for a while, whether the people behind it or the people who are promoting it (or the people who warn against it) seem to have earned some reputation themselves, etc., if it is a program to download then see if its open source, if its not then ask yourself (and others): "why not?", etc.
You MUST do some own research before YOU make a decision whether you trust someone or something, you cannot blindly delegate this to only one central authority which might not always be qualified or able to make this important decision for you. You must make important decisions yourself and you need to think about it for a while and consult as many sources of information and hear as many different opinions about it as possible before you can have your own opinion.

Because sometimes you want to move individual keys from A to B. As simple as that.
sending the money to the new wallet does not make the old keys in the old wallet disappear or magically redirect any future payments. What if someone finds an old "buy-me-a-beer" address from you in some old forum post or program you once wrote and decides to send you a few dozen millies (happened to me already multiple times, even to addresses I explicitly officially tried to declare obsolete and replaced them with new addresses). How would you handle that? Just last month I received a tip to an address that is supposed to not be used anymore and has been replaced since more than 2 years ago!
I agree that such a tool is probably not needed for most people in every day situations but **when** you need it then you need it and I needed something like this more than once already and nothing comfortable existed and I always ended up manually copy-pasting keys around, editing obscure key backup text file formats manually, messing around with a certain web browser wallet service that I normally don't like and don't use, etc. Thats why I now decided to solve this annoying problem once and for all. Such a tool has use cases for some people in certain situations.

Almost all of these "horror stories" turn out to be user errors (wrong interpretation / incomplete understanding of what MultiBit is trying to tell the user) and none of them actually result in lost coins.

The latency is typically less than 2 seconds, often less than one second. Its the establishing of a new TCP connection that is extremely slow over Tor, once the connection is established its not so bad anymore at all. For example you can do IRC chat or instant messaging in real time without any problems even with hidden services (twice as many hops as normal exit traffic) and its still quite responsive. Typical roundtrip times over 6 Tor nodes I have measured with the TorChat loopback ("Myself") connection are most of the time around (and sometimes even below) 2 seconds. The typical Tor traffic that is headed towards an exit node goes over 3 nodes only.

This must have been a separate problem and probably not directly related to the blockchain import code as far as I can tell from studying the code. Since during import the address was generated **only** from the imported private key while the address from the imported json was ignored it would not have been possible to end up with the correct address and the wrong key or any combination of address/key that did not belong together and did not satisfy the "check private keys" test. At least not in that part of the code. Its using the same constructor of ECKey that is also used elsewhere. 
The confirmed problem (you can try it out, its repeatable) is that you end up with the correct private key but the wrong address if the imported key was compressed. This can be corrected by taking the existing raw private key bytes and make a compressed version from it.
This problem also can not be identified by the "check private keys" tool, it can only be identified by looking at the addresses and the balance and see that certain addresses and bitcoins are missing but you need to compare the existing blockchain.info wallet (if you still have it) and the multibit wallet address by address.
I predict that the "check private keys" test will never find anything. I cannot see any circumstances under which it could ever find any inconsistency, unless you use a hex editor and manipulate individual bytes in the .wallet file.

If the computer is compromised with bitcoin stealing malware then both are equally insecure, the keys can be easily stolen from both. Blockchain.info can even be attacked by something as simple as a malicious browser extension, the attacker does not even need elevated privileges or platform specific API to hook into another process or into the keyboard input, he just needs a few lines of JavaScript to read the decrypted keys from the browser wallet because their 2Fa is a mere placebo to make it seem more secure but it isn't, their implementation is useless, it's a joke. Blockchain.info is the least secure wallet of all. The number of stolen bitcoins from blockchain.info wallets in relation to all other wallets confirms that.

Don't interpret too much into this statement from MtGox. To me it seems more like a lame excuse for something else (cooked books or whatever). One simply does not accidentally find 200k bitcoins in wallets that were believed to be empty, this is ridiculous!

If you read this thread there was nothing missing. He just could not find a file on his Mac because after the update apple decided to make the entire Library folder hidden.
It is slightly confusing that the app defaults to storing the wallet in this unusual folder, but it is unfair to claim Multibit would cause missing coins or that is less secure. This is just not true.
Multibit is actually a brilliant piece of code. The UI could need more polish but the concept is unique as it does not need separate infrastructure and can still run without full block chain download. The coins themselves are safe, even if it occasionally gets out of sync (which can be easily reset and resynced) or the user does not find a file in the file open dialog because its in a hidden folder (which does not make the file itself or the coins disappear, you are supposed to have made a backup anyways).
If you have a bunch of old non-deterministic keys (not derived from a seed) and you need a place to keep them (because some of them might still receive coins in the future) then Multibit is the wallet of choice. It does not suffer from the risks that are associated with browser wallets like blockchain.info, it has transparent and straightforward import/export function, it does not need 20GB while generating even more (undesired) non-deterministic keys like bitcoin-core, it can do emergency import and sweep from a lost Android Wallet, etc. For all these things its extremely useful and does its job very well, extremely quick and secure.

Since they now control all mining they could freeze any bitcoin address. The government of the jurisdiction where ghash is located could give them a list of addresses to freeze and they would be forced (by law) to implement the freeze and from then on no block could be mined that contained any tx involving that address. A judge could rule that since it is technically extremely easy to implement there is no excuse anymore, its not longer decentralized, they are factually in complete control of all mining, they would be forced to implement it.
Practically this would work like this, the events happen as follows (in chronological order):
* GHash has reached a solid 51+
* Law enforcement agency rightly(!) determines that ghash is the one and only person in charge of **all** bitcoin transaction processing
* Law enforcement agency issues a warrant to ghash to freeze bitcoin addresses xxx, yyy and zzz until further notice, effective immediately.
* ghash is legally forced to comply and not include any tx involving any of these addresses.
* ghash is legally forced to not mine on top of any block by other pools that tries to include that tx and they will publish that list of frozen addresses to all competing mining pools.
* all competing mining pools will be forced to also exclude these tx from their blocks in order to not be immediately orphaned and be able to continue mining any valid blocks at all.
* small pools that did not receive that list will not be able to mine any blocks at all or be forced to infer the list of frozen addresses by comparing their own blocks with the ones that will be mined in the ghash chain.
This is the most dangerous scenario of all, and given the stated goals of law enforcement agencies and their determination of reaching their goals it is the most likely scenario too. All that is needed is a simple warrant sent to ghash to do x and they would have to comply!
Edit: this would even work today, they just have to serve the same warrant to all large pools within their jurisdiction and if they have together 51+% the result would be that these addresses were effectively completely frozen. All it needs is the warrant needs to contain the clause that they are **not allowed to mine on top of any chain that contains these offending tx** under threat of punishment.

if this happens then software like p2pool (and any other mining software or pool whose block generation is transparent and all solo miners) would stop working, they would only produce orphans from the very moment on when one of the blocked tx enters the memory pool and they would try to mine them (and the large pools ignoring them) and this would continue to be so until they implement the filter list and this can't be done in secrecy, it must be known what exactly to filter in order to make software that produces "clean" blocks for the "clean" block chain.

Maybe your very first impression about the user interface and the areas where exactly it seemed difficult could be used to improve it. I am sure the developers of Electrum just don't see these problems anymore because they know it inside out and a new user who has never used it before can provide the most valuable input about where exactly the real problems in the user interface are located.
@_date: 2014-08-02 07:48:08
This is a bug in the wallet app. The QR-Code **always** contains the amount of BTC denominated in BTC and the wallet app is responsible for shifting the decimal accordingly after scanning to meet the preferred display unit (and to convert it back into full BTC before sending the transaction or generating a QR-Code). 
Milli or micro is strictly only for display or input to/from the user for convenience purpose, its confined to the user interface only. All things internally under the hood are supposed to work with BTC or at least it needs to know when to convert back and forth when communicating to external systems.

The entirety of p2pool could be 100% of all bitcoin mining and it would still be no problem as long as most people would not be mining on the very same p2pool node. And this can't happen because miners want the fastest connection and least amount of orphaned shares they will be connecting to a node located very close to them or even run their own node. Node hopping until you found the node that works best for you comes with absolutely no penalty, miners can switch between p2pool nodes all day long without any impact on their current PPLNS level.

Why is Electrum for "power users"? I think it should target end users. In its default setup its a very easy to use wallet, much easier to use than many other wallets and can be recommended to everyone, and if its used with its offline-signing feature then its like Armory stripped down in features to be usable by mere mortals but without giving up any security. It should really be labeled as "target: end users" in this table.

You should have asked for "wallet program" first and not for "wallet service". If you want to use bitcoins the way it was meant to be used you would do so with a locally installed program instead of relying on a 3rd party web service to do it for you.
Currently I would recommend Electrum:  as the  beginner-friendly wallet App for your PC (or Mac). Although it will be easy to use and trouble free you should read its documentation carefully before you begin using it and ask questions if anything is unclear.
Wallet services like mentioned in some of the other answers that allow remote access to your money from anywhere are more vulnerable to theft for exactly this reason: they potentially allow access to your money from anywhere and therefore provide a larger attack surface.
A local wallet app on the other hand will only allow you to move your bitcoins only when you have access to your computer (and you can make this as secure as you want, it even allows you to run it in a permanently unplugged (offline) mode using Electrum's offline storage functions to manage the bitcoins entirely offline).

Maybe they weren't even there in the first place. 
What if there were only 100k BTC and MK artificially inflated the numbers of traded BTC on his exchange by introducing fake-accounts trading fake-BTC (maybe also for fake-USD) and somehow (accidentally?) it got out of balance and they ended up being bought by real users for real money and got mixed with real BTC and now they cannot untangle this unholy mess anymore?

Lol, these tulip guys cannot admit that they were wrong. They rather redefine reality than admitting that their initial opinion was plain wrong. A "tulip bubble" that refuses to crash can only be due to tulip bulbs unexpectedly and magically turning into pure gold without prior notice. It is absolutely impossible that they were made of gold all the time already since this would invalidate their earlier judgment and this is absolutely impossible. They are always right and even if they are proven wrong then they were still right but reality has changed instead.

You can attach binaries. Some time ago they had a "downloads" section where you could just upload files, very much like on googlecode or sourceforge, now they have replaced this with "releases" to allow you to associate them with a tag.
If you create a new release it will also create a tag (or if you already have a tag you can make a "release" associated with this tag) and then write some descriptive text **and attach any number of binary files** to it. It then looks like this:

I haven't heard of any Android coin stealing malware yet. For some time I was collecting all the "my bitcoins are gone"-threads on reddit to make a statistic but it was pretty boring because OS was mostly Windows and wallets were mostly web wallets and exchanges, in combination with compromised email and/or dropbox backups or similar fuckups, so I eventually stopped. There was only one incident where the victim used blockchain.info on Android but this also involved a desktop PC and possibly compromised email account and no evidence that the theft actually happened on Android, that was only the place where he first noticed the blockchain.info theft.
Regarding the apps I would say the most dangerous apps currently would be apps targeting bitcoin users (all these useless little price ticker widgets and stuff that have only 142 downloads), the large well known and popular apps from trustworthy authors are probably less likely to contain any hidden rootkits.
On Android all apps are isolated against each other (much stricter than on Windows, Mac or Linux) and are only allowed to communicate or share data via well defined ways and this is regulated by permissions. There is no way and there exists no permission an app could require to read another apps private storage folder, such a permission simply does not exist, this would require root privileges which apps can not request if the phone is not rooted.
It **might** be possible for an evil app to use some kind of privilege escalation exploit to grant themselves root privileges but this would require significant amount of criminal intention on the side of the app author, it would be much worse than the usual "spyware" stuff (which is all officially granted by the user anyways), it would be like granting themselves a permission that is not even supposed to exist and I don't believe you would find something like this in any of the large popular apps, they all have a reputation to lose, the shitstorm would be of epic proportions and people would go to jail for something like this [hidden rootkit], even if it didn't target bitcoin at all.

Even all the foundation people and other bitcoin elite celebrities and hindsight prophets who are now all so busy mentioning everywhere that they knew it all along for many years already could not believe until the very last moment that he would be able to lose the entirety of the deposited bitcoins and questioned the authenticity of the "crisis paper" simply because it was so totally un-fucking-believable and unreal.

if the HDD is physically broken beyond repair (head crash) then its probably more expensive than 60 Dollars. Otherwise maybe if its still possible to read individual sectors with specialized software it might be possible to restore the wallet file.
Ask a friend who knows how deal with these kind of problems. The file you are looking for has the file extension *.wallet (probably multibit.wallet or default.wallet, I'm not 100% sure which one of these two names it is, look for all files with .wallet file name extension) and it will be in the AppData/Multbit/ folder of your profile (your friend [the one with sufficient computer knowledge] will know where to look if he somehow can mount the file system or scan for files (only if the disk is not entirely broken, otherwise forget it because it will cost 4 digit amounts to have a physically broken disk recovered by a professional data recovery company)).
Next time make a backup before it breaks.
I recommend the Electrum wallet, its backup consists of 12 English words written down on a piece of paper (or engraved into a plate of metal to survive a fire [of course you will have to engrave it yourself, nobody else may ever see these 12 words or he will be able to take all the money]).

It should also be noted that if you are mining against an existing public p2pool node you can switch to any other p2pool node (here is a list:  **without losing your accumulated PPLNS** or any other penalty, you can switch nodes as often as you want as long as you keep using the same username (payout address).

It works in emergencies too.
* make an unsigned transaction with the online wallet (30 seconds)
* save it to USB (5 seconds)
* move USB to offline computer (2 minutes because you have to wait until its booted up)
* sign it (10 seconds)
* save signed tx back to USB (5 seconds)
* move USB to online computer (30 seconds)
* broadcast it (5 seconds)
* wait for 1 confirmation (10 minutes)
* wait for another 5 confirmations so your business partner is satisfied (50 minutes)
 
[Edit] OK, I understand that step 1 could actually one week instead of 30 seconds if you use Armory, this is why I suggested using Electrum for online and offline wallet, there it syncs instantly, even after not using it for years.
[Edit2] It might be possible to make a transaction with the online wallet even if its not fully synced, but it must be synced at least to the point where it shows enough unspent outputs to use them in your transaction.

The "Willy" bot (if it even existed) would have filled orders of real traders. For example I had small limit sells in regular intervals slightly above the market there, when it came along and bought then it has filled my orders, the $USD from these sales appeared in my gox account balance. Market price never went through my sell orders without filling them, not a single time and I had thousands of automated limits and closely watched my log files. From my point of view there was not one single satoshi or cent discrepancy between the trades visible in the book and the records of my own bot. Not once. They were all properly filled and the USD credited to my account.

You don't want to work with private keys (believe me, you really don't), instead what you really want is to work with a **seed**!
* Install electrum, write down the seed on paper. Treat that as your "private key". Its actually the seed from which the private keys will be generated but for your intents and purposes its just as good as a raw private key, and its easier to handle. Newbies should generally not mess around with private keys, the concept of "seed" comes pretty close to what most people actually want to do with their private key (paper wallet for example), so just use a wallet that gives you a seed and do with the seed what you would otherwise had intended to do with the private key (store it on paper for example). Electrum is the easiest of these wallets and very much recommended.
* use the first bitcoin address that Electrum gives you as your savings address, copy/paste it to somewhere so you don't make an accidental typo and use that to send money to it.
* uninstall electrum, remove its data from the %appdata% folder.
Now you can continue sending money to that address (and even watch it from time to time on blockchain.info or blockexplorer, etc. to see how much you already have)
should you ever need access to the bitcoins again just install Electrum again, select "restore from seed", type in the 12 words and there you have your wallet again.

The warrant could be made less broad (in the beginning), maybe not include any tainted coins so it would not directly affect most (all?) miners. And of course it could contain a clause that its effective only for blocks mined from now on, no need to roll back thousands of blocks (because they would know this is impossible, they want the pools to be able to comply, not force them out of business).
Maybe they are waiting with this until they have enough hashrate concentrated in pools that are big enough or corruptible enough (mainly driven by commercial interest and not by idealism) and therefore unlikely to perform a lavabit-style suicide as a result of such a warrant. Maybe the old pools like BTCGuild or Slush or Eligius would rather have chosen to commit suicide than comply but with pools like ghash this seems unlikely to me. Maybe they are just waiting until enough hash power is concentrated in the hands of corruptible businessmen with no ethics and no idealism whatsoever until they start this kind of attack.

If you have an offline wallet with electrum you can create its watch-only counterpart on an online computer. Thats how it is intended to be used.
On the offline wallet look for the menu item that will let you show you the **master public key**. Move this MPK to the online PC (save it to an USB stick). Its very much like a seed but for the addresses only, it creates the exact same sequence of addresses as the offline wallet, only without their private keys, therefore you can safely create a watch only version of the offline wallet.
* Move the Master Public Key to the online machine
* There on the online version of Electrum create a new wallet and choose **create a watching only version of an existing wallet** and then enter the master public key.
Now you will be able to watch your wallet. 
You can even make a transaction to spend bitcoin with the online watch only wallet but it will not be signed, it will make an unsigned transaction that will be saved to a file, move this file to the offline wallet, there load it, sign it, save the signed transaction back to the USB, move it back to the online wallet, load it and broadcast it. This way you can spend from the cold wallet without ever having to bring it online.
There are tutorials about this topic and its also described in the official help. This is one of the outstanding killer features of Electrum, only few other wallets can do this. Please google this topic and read more about it.

Because its not a wallet, its an **account**.
Accounts can show any number, even negative or even fictional amounts (as we have seen in the case of MtGox).
A wallet on the other hand can only contain something or nothing. Think of your physical wallet for Dollar notes and coins: It can contain money or it can be empty but it cannot contain negative coins.
This is why this coinbase thing should not be called "wallet", its an account, not a wallet. A bitcoin wallet on the other hand behaves like a physical wallet in this regard because bitcoin is like cash in your wallet.

Because they were obviously created by making up a meaningful human readable phrase as the address and there is no way of calculating the private key from an address, it only works the other way around (make a private key and then calculate its biotcoin address) and you will always end up with random looking gibberish string of letters and numbers as address. 
You can of course try millions of different private keys to eventually end up with an address that has maybe a sequence 5 or 6 meaningful letters in it but the problem of doing this over the entire length of the address is equivalent to brute forcing a key from an address and this will not be not practical before computers can be made that operate somewhere else than in space and time.

Bitcoin wallets were called "wallet" to make them distinct from "account". This resonates with the well understood difference between book money in bank **accounts** and **cash** money carried around in physical **wallets**.
Since bitcoin in a bitcoin wallet is for all practical intents and purposes much more like cash in a wallet than book money in an account this made perfect sense. The term "wallet" instead of "account" is meant to highlight this important difference, it should help people understand the difference.
The hijacking of the term "wallet" by account service providers (banks) that hold book money instead of letting the user hold cash in a wallet, this wrong usage of the term "wallet" is a deliberate attempt to achieve two things:
* make their product look similar to the competition, use their names and terminology to trick the consumers into believing it is something similar or comparable
* weaken the important distinction in terminology and destroy the association "wallet" == "cash" by intentionally using this term in the wrong context, until it does not mean anything special anymore at all or even worse until the association in people's minds is "wallet" == "account".
[Hint: Hello Coinbase!]
The ability to slowly manipulate language and change the meaning of words (with huge and sustained marketing campaigns) is a powerful weapon.

You still have to wait until Tuesday if you send the money on a Friday evening. They are required by law to complete a transfer in not more than one business day and they are trying to use every second of that time, so Friday does not count anymore because it was one minute after 16:00, the transaction is then "processed" on Monday instead and then takes 1 day and arrives Tuesday afternoon.

This should teach everybody a lesson who believes remote-controlled devices and apps are a good place to store valuable data.
Use a proper **locally** installed wallet application, installed in an environment that you control yourself and nobody else. Chrome browser is remote controlled (as well as iPhone and Android, everything that has a remote "kill-switch". At least try to avoid those where the existence of it is openly admitted and/or proven to exist).
* Electrum
* Multibit
* Bitcoin-core
* etc...
and install them in such a way that nobody can remotely decide to uninstall them without your consent.
Stop using all this browser and web app crap. Use applications. There is no reason to use browser extensions or even web apps on the **desktop** for stuff that could just as well be implemented as a standalone application. I hope this will teach some of you a lesson.

A brain wallet can be anything that maps memorizable information to one or more private keys in a deterministic way.
It could be a 12 word Electrum seed, It could be a sentence that has to be run through sha256 but it could just as well need a different hash function or multiple rounds of hash, it could be the raw key in WIF format memorized directly, it could be anything and if it is a secure brain wallet then it might not use any of the popular methods mentioned above at all.
Therefore OP must find out (remember) how it was generated to be able to find or reconstruct the right tool to decode it again.

Thats why you are supposed to **keep backups**. For a HD bitcoin wallet this is as simple as writing down 12 words on paper and store the paper in a safe location (or copies of it in multiple locations), it doesn't involve any electronic device that could fail or any electricity at all and you need to do this only once when you set up your wallet for the first time and never have to worry again.

not recommended, this would be a pretty large sheet of paper with hundreds of addresses.
Better make a new paper wallet and send the funds there with a normal transaction. 
I recommend not a classic paper wallet (private key -&gt; address) but instead make a HD wallet (seed -&gt; MPK), those are much easier to handle, to spend from, even partially without worries about low-level stuff like change, wallet apps provide comfortable UI to access it unlike the current mess with naked private keys. You could use Electrum to generate it, you don't even need a printer on the offline PC, just pen and paper.

You need neither "decent spec" nor chromebook to run an offline Electrum. 
Just take the oldest and cheapest notebook you can find, install the newest version of Lubuntu, install Electrum and then disconnect from the network forever. 
Then create your offline wallet (seed + mpk).
To create the seed you print out this file:  pin it to your wall and then throw 12 darts from a distance of 12 feet (works only after drinking 12 beer). Then burn the printouts, destroy the darts and tear down the wall.

The private key is given in letters/numbers and also in QR. Bothe are the **exact** same information and can be used for wallet import.

Maybe the encoding is different (base58 or base16) but its exactly the same thing.

It happens only if you have previously imported compressed keys into blockchain.info.
Check keys reports no error because the address matches the key. Every key can have 2 addresses, compressed and uncompressed. Both are correct. The information which one to use is lost during import,so you have the correct key but the wrong one of its 2 valid addresses. This can be fixed by using the raw private key bytes and making a compressed version of it manually.
And this is not really multibit's fault, the importer was contributed by blockchain themselves! And now it has been removed because of this, its better if they don't need to care about other people's broken file formats, multibit is complicated enough.

yes. In the simplest form (not recommended) you can do this (without any software, just cutting in pieces) but then you must make sure you won't ever lose any of the parts.
If you want to be able to tolerate the loss of a certain percentage of the fragments and still be able to reproduce the key from the remaining ones then use something like above mentioned Shamir's Secret Sharing which builds some redundancy into the parts it generates so that **m out of n** parts would be sufficient to reconstruct the whole.
Example: Split into 5 shares (of which minimum 3 are needed to reconstruct):
    $ echo "My name is Rumpelstiltskin" | ssss-split -q -t 3 -n 5
    1-1a25569b3a4c3e3495952993afe56addb1b2a7e19a1bd4720ae1

I strongly recommend using Electrum instead of Bitcoin-Qt for your use case, its easier to handle in terms of backup (essentially all you need is a piece of paper to write down 12 english words) and its much quicker to restore from the backup once you need access to it since it does not need to download the entire block chain.
You don't do the network a favor if you use Bitcoin-Qt only intermittandly, it even puts more load on the network, it will do a huge download on every sync and then only stays online to help other nodes for a very short time, it does not help if you don't let it running constantly. So for your use case a light wallet is more appropriate and in terms of easy and foolproof backup/restore there is nothing that can compete with the simplicity of Electrum.

Use Mycelium Wallet for Android to spend from paper wallets. It has a fool-proof procedure for spending even partial amounts, handling the change correctly, you can't mess it up, not even when intentionally trying to mess it up or when drunk or under other influence, you can't do it wrong, no matter how hard you try.
If you use the right software for the job then you don't need to worry about correct handling of such low level details, after all thats what computers were invented for: to free us from the need of having to do these complicated low level things manually.
In Mycelium select from the menu: "cold storage", then scan your bip38 key, enter bip38 password, scan the destination address, enter amount and send the coins. Change will be sent back to the same paper wallet where it came from.
**Always use the appropriate tools for the job** and don't try to do complicated things by hand that are otherwise done by the machine automatically and correctly.
I strongly recommend not using Blockchain.info since its confusing as hell and error-prone. And its insecure.

@_date: 2014-01-23 16:20:02
I have to agree with this answer, its probably currently the safest and most foolproof way to redeem a paper wallet, almost impossible to do it wrong or mess it up. The menu entry in Mycelium to use this feature is labeled "cold storage". It allows spending of the balance (or part of it) without permanently importing the key or storing it anywhere. Use this to scan teh paper wallet private key and then send the entire balance to the MultiBit wallet.
An alternative solution would be to import the key into MultiBit directly but this is more complicated and not officially documented, its not really meant to be done by beginners, it involves creating a text file, pasting the key into this text file and then importing this file into MultBit. The file must have the file ending .key so that MultiBit recognizes it as key backup file and after the operation is completed it should be safely deleted and wiped from the disk again so that no fragments of unencrypted keys remain anywhere on the HDD. Experts only.

No, this does not happen "when it comes to computers". Computers are deterministic, humans are not, so the reason for sudden strange behavior is always human (mis)behavior.
Your double SMS did not arrive for no reason. It arrived because you have a password sniffer on your PC and the attacker (or his automated bot) after successfully sniffing your login immediately also tried to use your credentials to log in himself and that caused the duplicated SMS.
Your PC is infected. Get rid of it, format its HDD.
Then reinstall your PC from scratch and this time maybe choose from all the available different operating systems not the one that is known for being the most insecure piece of software ever created, choose something else this time.

They don't care about money, they want the 51%. 
There would be many ways to voluntarily regulate it, for example refusing new registrations for a limited time until it normalizes again was already mentioned, another one would be raising the fees until it normalizes. These steps would be taken when the pool owner is honestly interested in avoiding the 51% situation.
If they don't do any of that although its high time proves that they are not interested in giving up some hash power, they obviously want as much hash power as they can get. 
Just wait until they begin paying small bonuses (negative fees). The average dumb ASIC owner does not care about 51%, Gigahash would rise to 85% within a week.

or even better use Mycelium's "cold storage" option if you want to spend only a part of it, it was specifically designed for exactly this use case.

No, everybody wants his **own** coins to be worth 100%. The history of your incoming coins is uncertain (and you have no influence) but you always want your coins to be worth 100% once they are in your own wallet. Everybody will think this way, everybody will outright dismiss to even think about adopting any such convention that could possibly also harm the value of his own coins. 
Just like it is today with cash. Nobody cares about the history of his paper cash notes, even if they have serial numbers on them, try convincing people that their own cash might probably be tainted and they need to have all notes checked by the federal cash validation office and possibly have them confiscated, everybody would dismiss this as absurd, nobody would want to bring his cash to this office, such a system could not evolve voluntarily and naturally, only with brutal force and then people would begin seeking untraceable alternatives because they just would not want something like that.

Bots are essential for any functioning exchange, if there are no bots then its dead. You want to attract bots.
Also I did not suggest "fake bots". I was talking about market making bots to have some liquidity (real liquidity of course not fake liquidity) in the order book. If you can't afford the money the bots would need to provide this liquidity then you must attract liquidity from elsewhere. For this an exchange (if they are clever) typically rewards liquidity providers with a negative fee. Set your fees as follows:
limit order -0.2%  (this will attract the liquidity and the bots)  
market order +0.4% (this will bring home the bacon)

Because what you said is wrong. There are only temporary technical problems (well understood and explained by some of the bitcoin devs and also by me and therefore plausible), this has not been going on "for years", there you outright lied and as far as fiat is concerned you could and can withdraw fiat all the time, I heard SEPA took 2 business days a few days ago.

There is nothing to worry about MultiBit. Most of these stories are without substance and the two or three people who really lost money lost it because they messed up/crashed/formatted/whatever their PC and did not have a backup copy of their wallet file (or at least their .key export file). If you have a backup you have nothing to worry.
There was only one recent problem with blockchain.info aes.json import but that code has been removed, it turned compressed keys into uncompressed keys, but even this condition can be cured by opening the .wallet with wallet-key-tool and creating the compressed counterparts of the affected keys. It was caused by code that was contributed by a third party (blockchain.info themselves) but their code was not able to read their own format. Therefore it has been removed. Blockchain.info import is now available as an independent separate tool with new code written from scratch.

it did not handle compressed keys, they were silently converted into their uncompressed counterparts which makes them result in different addresses. (every private key can generate 2 addresses, a compressed one and an uncompressed one, the old code only created uncompressed addresses and did not compare the resulting address with the one in the json file to make sure this is the right one of the two possibilities. blockchain info is using an ancient private key encoding scheme that does not yet have the compressed/uncompressed flag. It does however contain the resulting address, so its still possible to do it correctly, you just have to generate both and choose the one that leads to the correct address)
Normally, if you are not one of the people like me who like to move keys around between different wallets all the time, you will probably not suffer from this bug. Blockchain.info itself is generating only uncompressed keys, so if you never imported other keys into blockchain.info then you are safe. If you have keys from vanitygen then you are probably safe also because it also makes uncompressed keys. I'm not 100 sure about bitaddress.org, probably also uncompressed but bitcoin-core is using compressed keys nowadays and also keys generated by Schildbach, Mycelium, Multibit are compressed, if you had one of them in blockchain.info and imported to multibit you will see discrepancies: Addresses will be missing, other addresses will be there that were not there before. Compare all blockchain.info addresses whether they also exist in the Multibit wallet. If there was a compressed one it did not get imported correctly.
Its still possible to recover from that, even if the aes.json has been deleted and the blockchain.info wallet does not exist anymore, the **keys** to these wrong addresses (they are in the wallet file) can still be used to generate the compressed counterparts of these addresses.

This is not a stretch, this is exactly what happened. Their wallet tried to spent the same output over and over because it was programmed to always blindly look for the oldest UTXO in their database to work around (instead of fix) the **other** problem with the immature coinbase transactions. 
So as soon as only **one** outgoing transaction is confirmed in mutated form and the system does not notice it and remove the output from their list of UXTO it will try to spend the same output over and over again and imediately the entire system comes to a grinding halt until they remove this output from their list manually and restart the system again.
Prior to 0.8 their wrongly padded (non-standard) tx just went through most of the time but after most nodes were updated they all got stuck and some people began manually sanitizing (mutating) them in an attempt to help their own withdrawals propagate and confirm, so by this time the mutated ones (mutated from the wrong gox format into the sane canonical form) were the **only** ones that went through at all and this had the side effect of making mtgox completely losing track of what is UTXO and what is STXO very fast.

If it breaks then just replace it, where is the problem? We are talking about seed-&gt;mpk cold storage, so if you need to sign a transaction and the old laptop won't boot anymore or does not exist anymore because you have deliberately destroyed it for maximum security then just set up a new offline machine, type in the seed (you have written on paper) and 5 seconds later you can sign your transaction.

No. There is no such thing as a "rational market" and if there ever was then certainly not today and not at MtGox. This market is driven by **fear** and is currently in full panic mode, there is blood in the streets at Mt. Gox, its time to buy!
Look at it this way: there are 2 possible outcomes:
* (a) gox is insolvent
* (b) gox is not insolvent
These are the only two possible outcomes. If (b) then you should buy MtGox BTC instead of MtGox USD. If (a) then you should also buy BTC because if after a 5 year long legal battle you get a certain percentage of your money back then the inflationary USD will be worth less than they are today but the BTC (even if its only a small fraction you get back) will have increased in value by factor 1000 during these 5 years.
So whatever the outcome of this will be: you should buy BTC.

Yes. If you have 8 outcoing connections that means there are now 8 nodes somewhere in this world who each need to find one less connection to the rest of the network themselves, you indirectly made 8 more free slots available somewhere else on the network for thin clients like the Android Wallet or MultiBit to connect to.
At the end of the day a connection between 2 nodes is still a connection, no matter which end of it was the one who established it. You are verifying and relaying tx and blocks between 8 other nodes, so your node does its job.

TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN!
There is a **market gap** in Europe as large as the grand canyon. While in the USA there seem to be dozens of shops to buy PC/Notebook/Components and stuff it is virtually impossible **in Europe** to buy any computer hardware with Bitcoins at all, the only way here is using SnapCard and they are processing the payment like this: BTC-&gt;BitPay-&gt;USD-&gt;PayPal-&gt;EUR which results in a premium of 7% (most of it eaten by PayPal) on top of the SnapCard 1% fee and makes it quite uncompetitive.
Last week I bought 2 new PCs and two new 22'' TFT screens and I went through the above trouble, I accepted the unfavorable conditions because I have enough bitcoins to spend and I wanted the hardware now and not in a week but if I had found only **one** shop accepting bitcoins directly I would not have spent a whole day researching dozens of shops and comparing prices, I would have bought there immediately without a second thought.
If I had the resources of opening such a shop myself I would seriously consider doing it myself but that is near impossible for me currently due to some other reasons.

Spread out your buying over longer periods (months), buy only small amounts, do NOT try to find the one perfect moment, you cannot time the market with such accuracy.
Don't look at the price charts at all, small fluctuations (+-30%) don't matter, just read this sub (1 minute a day, just a cursory look at the front page is enough) to get the reliable **indicators**:
* Put your buying on temporary hold and watch the roller coaster when the **moon season** begins (every other posting here in this sub containing the word "moon" or other astronomical bodies and everybody acting like they are out of their minds, happens at least once a year but not always at the same time). During this season you can spend more time on reddit to enjoy the amusement value, maybe even post a few moon postings yourself just for the fun of it but **RESIST** the temptation to buy more BTC. Buying BTC is strictly on hold during this time but you might want to spend a few BTC on a new computer, a new TV, a new car or a new house.
* Slowly start buying again when the roller coaster has abruptly ended and everybody else (except you) is feeling sick and depressed and postings about suicide hotline numbers are being upvoted to the top. This will be the best time to begin buying again.

Why would you want to do that in the first place?
Normally (the way it is meant to be used) you would create an unsigned transaction with the online-watch-only wallet and then sign the transaction offline with the offline-sign-only wallet.
If the online-watch-only Armory is too heavy on resources for you (it needs the entire block chain) then you could consider using Electrum instead which is much more suited to casual users and for cold storage that is not often used or unused for extended periods of time.

@_date: 2014-01-16 19:04:08
no. Your Post contained the words "Bubble" and "A vs B", the first one means you intended to show some characteristic development over time and this can only be done if the curve is scaled in such a way that any change is visible at all and the second one implies that you want to show how these changes over time **relate** to each other and that also cannot be shown if only one of the two curves is visible. 
You need to choose a chart scale such that both curves are clearly visible from beginning to end (hint: logarithmic). Of course then it might very well happen that what you initially wanted to show turns out to be wrong. You will not always get the results that you wanted to see when you plot some data in a honest and neutral way (by choosing the right values to plot and choosing the appropriate plot types for the data, especially when comparing two data sets against each other), instead of seeing what you want you will instead see cold hard reality. That might still be what you want because you suspected it all along or it might turn out that this does not show what you want at all and in this case you might not want to publish it (or in an act of objectivity you might publish it anyways).

I'm currently trying to explain the general principle and the setup here in this other thread (we haven't yet arrived at actually doing transactions, still setting up the wallet). 
Maybe you also want to watch how this unfolds, I hope it will succeed.
It is obvious that the Electrum user interface could be improved to make it more clear how things relate to each other, how to go through this process and how to test that it actually worked. For example I have seen people enter the MPK into the seed field and it doesn't throw an error, not even a warning because the seed field also accepts seed in hexadecimal form and the results in this case are unexpected, even dangerous. I hope that the information where exactly the users are struggling can eventually be incorporated into the Electrum UI to improve it.

the explanation with the technical problem is the simplest one with the fewest assumptions. The technical problems have been analyzed by various experts and found to be true (this is a proven fact) and they would cause exactly the observed symptoms and explain everything, no further assumptions needed.
Your theory on the other hand needs the following unlikely assumptions: (a) Mark has stolen all the money and spent it although his business model is extremely profitable and he has no reason to steal from his customers. (b) He orchestrated the technical problems with a level of detail that is truly astonishing and makes even experts believe they are genuine. (c) he keeps his exchange running, processes fiat withdrawals, makes changes to his code (ntxid) and continues to show up in his office every day even though it would have been much easier and much less dangerous to just take the money and run. This scenario totally makes no sense at all. If you want to invoke Occam's razor then Occam will agree with me, your scenario is just too absurd and implausible.

The effects of malleability is confusing their internal software. They are apparently tracking the withdraw tx **only** by using its tx hash in their internal database to determine which one went through and which ones are still pending. If this hash changes before it gets mined into a block then their system is confused and does not notice it, it thinks the tx did not go through (although it did go through with a different hash) and then attempts to **spend them again** when the next user wants to withdraw which obviously can't succeed and their system becomes totally disconnected from reality and tries to spend coins that are spent already and the result is a huge accounting mess and fucked up database integrity.
The solution would be to make their own system able to detect these mutated tx and update their own database and accounting system accordingly so that it won't be confused from these mutating tx hashes.

you could buy hash rate at nicehash and point the miner to a small public p2pool node (or even better your own p2pool node or maybe also point it to some other small pool)
When you place an order at nicehash be sure to stay below the current break even price, the BTC you would theoretically mine with 1TH/s on one day, use a mining calculator, currently its 0.0428 BTC/(TH/s*day).
There are a lot of orders at nicehash that pay 30% or more above this price (I have no idea what these poeple are doing with this insanely expensive hash power) but even if you place an order for 0.042 or 0.041 you will receive occasional bursts of hash power at a reasonable price (when the above mentioned orders are completed) and you should be able to break even.
You probably won't make profit, you are just changing money. But at least its better to do that with p2pool than with ghash/cex (you would not make any profits there too).
If you have your own miner you should also use p2pool, you will not mine less than with ghash. The myth that ghash would be more profitable is just an illusion.

The best (and most foolproof) tool to redeem paper wallets is the Mycelium Android App: Select "cold storage" from the menu, scan the private key, enter the amount (or press "all" to redeem everything), scan the destination address and send. Change (if any) is sent back to the paper wallet, nothing can go wrong. The key will never be stored on the flash memory, not even temporarily.

Use a wallet app that explicitly **provides the option** to spend from paper wallets and says so in its user manual, **do not** try to creatively abuse **other** apps that do not have this option for doing things they were not originally designed for (like importing keys from the command line and stuff), this can work if you know 101% what you are doing but since you needed to ask this question you obviously have not yet reached this expert level! 
Wallet apps that allow safe paper wallet spending are:
* Mycelium (recommended, 100% foolproof, you can't do anything wrong, even if you try really hard, its impossible to mess it up. Use the "cold storage" option from the menu, it was designed for exactly this purpose)
* Blockchain.info (next best option if Mycelium is not available but make sure you have full control over this blockchain.info account, you know its wallet-id and passwords, 2fa and everything, so you don't accidentally lock yourself out in the middle of this process. Making a new blockchain account on the fly just for doing something quickly and then forgetting its password or not writing down its wallet id and mnemonics seems to be a real problem happening to people, its just too easy to make this mistake, so make sure you have full control over this wallet account first and can log out and log in again any time without problems before you use it for anything.)

If you are one of the naive tools who really believes the unfounded FUD and panic-sold all your coins for half of their value then you will remember my words when you count your losses.
Here is what is going to happen:
* MtGox announces resumption of BTC withdrawal
* People start wthdrawing BTC and report success here and in the forums
* MtGox BTC/USD will explode to &gt;800 within less than a few hours, maybe only miniutes
* MtGox will continue to process every single BTC withdrawal immediately without any problems
* All those who have sold at gox at the bottom will regret it and cry bitter tears.
Here is what **I** am doing: I am also buying cheap coins at gox, I have moved a 5 figure amount of EUR into cheap gox coins yesterday. But I have also **WARNED** the n00bs to NOT give away their coins for half of their value and thats all I can do, if they ignore the warnings and choose to dump their BTC anyways then there is nothing more I can do. I'm buying those cheap BTC because otherwise I would be an idiot for not doing so but my conscience is clean!

He wants to spend from the cold electrum wallet. The question is clear, isn't it?
For this he would make a transaction on the seedless watch-only version of the wallet, then when prompted save the unsigned tx to an USB drive, bring this USB drive to the offline machine, open it with Electrum to sign it, save it back to the USB, bring the USB back to the online machine, open it with Electrum and push it to the network.
This is complicated but data must be manually moved from A to B and then back from B to A, otherwise it would not be "offline".

Electrum can do that too. Armory is no longer the only one. Especially for occasional users and non-experts I would nowadays recommend Electrum while Armory remains for the "power users" only.

Electrum is open source and its code won't disappear as long as long as anybody still has coins in an Electrum wallet. Even if it changes its seed algorithm or is replaced by a different program and the old electrum is not developed further anymore then one or more of the following will happen:
* There will be tools available to convert your old electrum seed into a list of private keys to import elsewhere
* The successor of Electrum will be able to import the old seeds
* The old Electrum code will still be around and can be used to derive the keys from the seed.
* The old Electrum code will be forked and revived and a community around it will keep it alive.

paper wallets are called paper wallets because they are meant to exist only on paper. If you want them to be files that are moved around on computers and storage devices you could just as well use a conventional wallet application and this would probably even do a better job of keeping your keys private and prevent you from accidental fuck-ups because these wallet apps can encrypt the wallet files and (if used in the way they are meant to be used) they will prevent you from losing money by accident (instead of having to handle your keys manually and copy/paste sensitive stuff around from one app to the other and following complicated procedures which leaves a lot of room for human error a wallet application will handle all this for you in the best possible way and automatically).
Paper wallets are a nice invention and if used properly can increase security a lot but you should 100% understand what you are doing and understand all implications.

find the *.wallet file and copy this to the SD card.
Multibit does not have "wallet.dat", it has a "default.wallet" file instead which serves the same purpose, its just a different file format.
The file name of the currently opened wallet (along with its folder name) is visible in the title bar of Multibit. Go to this folder and copy the .wallet file to your SD card. 
You should also copy the .info file from the same folder (which contains the address labels). The .info file is optional, its only the address labels, its not critical if its missing but there is no reason to not also back it up.
These two files are all you need.
Note that it is not necessary for them to be in this hard to find location in Appdata/Roaming/, you can also move them elsewhere so they are easier to find: Close the wallet in multibit (file-&gt;close), then quit Multibit, then copy the wallet and the info to a more convenient location, then start it again and open the wallet again (file-&gt; open) in its new location.
If you are using the "Export private keys" option from the link above you will be fine too, this creates a *.key file and is also usable to restore your wallet but should you ever need to restore from the .key file you will lose the address labels (you won't lose any money but you will lose all the labels and this is annoying). 
For this reason I recommended the other method: backup the .wallet and its .info, this is more convenient.

It demonstrates that you can exchange bitcoins almost as if they were physical objects from person to person without a middleman.
If you buy stuff from classifieds ads in your local newspaper, for example a used Motorbike or a fishing pole or a boat or stuff like that you will also meet strangers with a bundle of cash and these are usually NOT bitcoiners! How old are you? Can't you remember the time when people privately bought stuff from other people and met in person with cash? Have you never done this? If I am for example selling my lawnmower and you want to buy it and you are living in the same city, wouldn't it be the most straightforward thing for you to just come over to me with a bundle of cash (or a wallet with bitcoins), inspect the item, negotiate a price and buy it from me on the spot? Or what is your definition of "straightforward"?

no, the non-compliant pool would not mine any valid block at all and therefore not be able to collect any block rewards. Read the second half of the first sentence: "or any block that is directly or indirectly referencing another block with transactions from or to any of the below-listed bitcoin addresses". The large pool would be forced to orphan the non-compliant blocks and because of the huge hash power majority it would succeed! The same warrant could even be served to more than one pool, serve an identical warrant to the 3 largest pools and no other pool would mine any non-compliant block anymore unless they figure out which transactions to exclude and then teeth-gnashingly do it in order to survive.


They have no choice. As long as that hypothetical "petahash.oi" pool has the 51% all other pools would be forced to comply as well or they would not mine **any** block at all!
Miners would either mine for the compliant pools and have no problems or mine for small pools and make zero money at all.

This script would be reasonably simple to audit and the new CD would inherit all trustworthiness of the original Ubuntu.

I strongly recommed using candlestick charts (as they are the default at bitcoinwisdom). 
I believe the absolute highs and lows during a certain time frame are far more important for placing orders than the average (or even worse a single random sample such as "close" out of many equally important prices). 
Out of all the trades that happen during a certain time the High and Low values deserve special attention because they tell you what barriers have **not** been broken, which stops must have been triggered, they often (especially if they were truly outstanding highs or lows) also hint to where others might place limit orders in expectancy of this becoming an important resistance or support level (self fulfilling prophecy sometimes but nevertheless (or just because of this) it is important to be aware of these levels).

It is less secure than a strictly local wallet because it opens more attack vectors:
* It allows remote access from everywhere in the world.
* It sends key backups to your email account, therefore it also totally needlessly brings your email account security into the equation
* it runs in the web browser, typically this should be the last place on earth where anybody would ever want to store the most valuable secret key data, there is no other place on your computer where the keys are closer to escaping to the internet than in the web browser.
Blockchain.info is recommended a lot but only by people who like it for its convenience and are not aware of the serious security implications of this huge compromise known as blockchain.info. Blockchain.info is actually a security nightmare compared to almost any other wallet! Many of these people would probably also recommend coinbase. In fact I believe even coinbase would be more secure (in terms of hackability) than blockchain.info because at least they don't send your keys around halfway around the planet (they don't give out any keys at all) and as opposed to blockchain.info their 2fa can't be circumvented but since coinbase is a bank and not a wallet it has its own problems (subject to account seizure, bankruptcy, etc) and generally does not resonate well with the spirit of Bitcoin as a pure electronic cash system, so I don't recommend it.
I recommend Electrum.

No, its not. As a programmer I understand what happened at MtGox. Although the wording of their press release is idiotic since they blame it entirely on Bitcoin and not on their own faulty vulnerable system which was too easy to confuse it still remains a fact that when using tx id that can change before tx is mined as a primary key in their accounting db then this will lead to a complete accounting mess and database inconsistency as soon as any noteworthy amount of tx mutations appear on the network.
They have now an enormous accounting mess to clean up and restore database integrity, they did not lose money, their automated withdraw system just lost complete track of where exactly it is. Its still there, just not where their database thinks it is. Now they have to fix the code and clean up the mess and re-index their db and then restart it.

@_date: 2014-01-08 22:46:11
You can only use it on the same computer where multibit is installed. You should do the following things:
* protect the wallet with a **strong** password (File -&gt; Add password)
* don't ever forget this password. Never ever forget it.
* **make a backup of the wallet file** (its file name is shown in the title bar), store it on a separate external drive. Make multiple copies to store them in different locations (buildings / cities / countries).
* make a new backup every time after you have created new receiving addresses to make sure these new addresses with their keys are also backed up. To simplify this you can make a few dozen new addresses in advance before you backup, so you can then later just use them one after the other without having to make a new backup every time. A complete backup will allow you to restore your wallet completely with all its addresses and their bitcoins on a new computer.
* keep your computer clean from malware, the usual suggestions for this topic apply here (be careful with email attachments, don't install random downloaded nonsense, don't accidentally install unwanted things by clicking on every file you come across, install all security updates for OS and web browser and other software, etc), probably the best thing you can do is use it on a separate computer that is never ever used for email and web surfing or anything other than bitcoin. Even more secure would be if this were a Linux computer (get an old Laptop and install (L|X)ubuntu or similar user friendly Linux distribution).

You could also calculate the public master key from the seed and then immediately forget the seed again and only store the public master key.
BTW: The thing with the airplane mode does not make sense, if there were something on the phone that could grab the seed while you entered it then it would certainly not stop attempting to send it until you go online again. There is a reason why all instructions for procedures that must be done offline always also contain the clause "and never connect to the internet ever again". If you leave that last part away then you can just as well leave the entire offline away because it would become totally meaningless.
@_date: 2014-02-13 21:56:53
The alternative would be MultiBit (assuming you don't want to run a full blown Bitcoin-Qt or Armory) but MultiBit has a few disadvantages: Its reusing the same addresses over and over while Electrum will generate new addresses with a deterministic algorithm from a single seed and Electrum is easier to backup, you just have to write down 12 english words on a piece of paper, no need to store a backup file anywhere.
Another advantage of Electrum is that you can also use it to offline sign transactions, similar to Armory you can have an online watch-only wallet and an offline sign-only wallet generated from the same seed (you don't need to do this with small amounts but its nice to know the wallet software you are using *can* do this if you need it, so you don't need to switch to a different software once you decide to build yourself an ultra high security offline wallet)
However, there is one thing for which MultiBit might be useful and this is if you also have the Android Schildbach wallet on your Android phone, these two wallets (Schildbach and Multibit) can import each other's backup files, so it could be useful to have MultiBit around for emergency backup import (and sending its coins to a safe place) if your mobile is stolen or lost.

Exchange rate is always multiplicative and therefore always needs a log chart. One indication for such a thing is you can use (and plot) the reciprocal just as well as the value itself, for example it does not make a difference whether you use BTC/USD or USD/BTC they fundamentally work the exact same way. Another indication is if negative values would not make any sense at all, there is no way it could ever become negative and there is no upper bound, it could grow many orders of magnitudes and the variance also grows with the value (heteroscedasticity).
Almost all quantities you observe in nature, masses, sizes, forces, energies, counts, etc. fall under this category. The same is true for stock prices and exchange rates and other fundamental financial quantities, they all have a variability proportional to their absolute value, most often they very nicely show a log-normal distribution and therefore the only reasonable way to plot them is a logarithmic y-axis.

Just use milli or micro if you refer to small numbers. These are well established and well known and widely used in everyday life already. 
There is no need to introduce some obscure variant of the scientific notation where you take "428e-5" and then remove the "e" to arrive at something as confusing as "428-5".

Did you ever look at a historic bitcoin price chart to know what **volatility to expect** before you bought them?
Look at this **logarithmic** chart, carefully study it it and note how it could easily drop to 200 and this would still not be considered unusual given the historic volatility:
Maybe all these bitcoin charting sites should switch to log scale as default view to avoid such accidents, people could more easily see the historic volatility and see the sheer magnitude of moves to expect (in both directions) and how insignificant a mere 50% correction looks compared to historic events.
Please from now on only use logarithmic charts instead of linear charts (panic charts) because on a linear chart you will always only see huge dramatic action completely out of context and be completely blind to the really important information.
Edit: I have choosen MtGox data because of all exchanges it has the longest history to illustrate my point.

If for example ghash turns evil with 60% and tries to sabotage the network then the community and the core devs could agree to implement some other mining algorithm beginning from block x onwards and release this as the next bitcoin-core software update. This software would only accept and propagate blocks that are mined according the new rules beginning at the day when block x is reached. From then on the ghash blocks would be ignored, the chain would fork, ghash would have its own altcoin.
All users would then make a decision. Use the old one or use the new one or use both in parallel and see how it develops, maybe even trade them against each other to establish an exchange rate (users would initially have the same balance in both chain forks but only one of them will turn out to be the most popular and most valued, they would have different prices).
If the majority of users decide to install that update and call that the only true bitcoin from now on then all miners would have to either mine with the new rules/algorithms if they want to mine these bitcoins or continue to mine on the ghash chain to earn what would now be just yet another altcoin.
The majority of users running full nodes determines which one of these two incompatible coins they want to call "Bitcoin" from now on and everything else would then be just another alt-coin.

Its unfortunately not possible to confirm any of these private conversations since the only two people who can do that are the ones who actually were part of the conversation. 
Its not logged anywhere else (maybe the NSA has a copy) and so you have to ask MagicalTux for confirmation and if he answers in a private IRC chat then you are faced with the same problem: **you** will then know with 100% certainty what he answered to you but there were no **witnesses** around and you can't prove it to anyone else. All you have is a log file on your computer that is plain text and **not cryptographically signed**.

Experienced traders could try to NOT buy when they notice another cycle of euphoria beginning (and rather sell or spend some of their coins while its rising) and again start buying after or during these violent corrections. This would work against the price swings, dampen them, but all the noobs will do the exact opposite: they will buy all the way up like crazy and then panic sell during the crash until the bottom.
In the next iteration many of these noobs will then join the experienced traders and try to avoid their previous mistake but an even larger amount of fresh noobs will arrive, many more than last time and will incite another bubble cycle.

Do yourself a favor, setup an electrum wallet and move your coins there. 
All these complicated blockchain.info procedures do not make it any more secure, quite the opposite, it makes it less secure by giving you more ways to fuck it up or leak your keys. Its moving backups of your wallet half way around the planet, involves email accounts that can be compromised, multiple computers from which you can access the coins and the weakest one of them will compromise it, you are increasing the attack surface by orders of magnitude and its difficult to understand what exactly it is doing with your keys and how they are secured.
On the other hand a simple Electrum wallet consists of a piece of paper with 12 english words and exactly one computer which is controlled only by you and nobody else is involved. Its transparent and much easier to understand at any time where your keys are, where they have been and how they are secured.

I have an additional recommendation that you might want to consider: If you want a wallet for everyday / short term usage that has a complete and consistent backup on paper then you should have a look at the Electrum wallet. Its backup is a seed of 12 words you can write down on a piece of paper, this paper can then be used to completely restore the wallet with all its addresses in case of a complete hardware failure (failed HDD, computer stolen, etc). 
If you think about it for a while this is also some kind of paperwallet: For example you could generate a new electrum seed offline, write it down on paper and also write down its first bitcoin address, then fund it with your bitcoin savings and then shut down and destroy this offline computer. Now you have essentially a paper wallet. To access the funds you would just install Electrum on a new computer and restore from the 12 seed words and instantly have a fully usable spending wallet again. You could spend some and then destroy the computer again (or format its HDD), the paper would still work, you could do this as often as you want.

I'm using MultiBit myself for more than 2 years now and my wallet has had 3 figure BTC amounts in it (until I recently put most of it into not-so-hot-almost-cold-storage). I found MultiBit a reliable wallet, I trust it. BTW the code that does the low level bitcoin stuff in MultiBit is maintained by Mike Hearn, one of the core devs.
I would recommend the following: 
* Export the keys ("Tools -&gt; Export private keys"), set a passwort for the export file to not have them lying around plain on the harddrive. 
* Then create a new wallet in MultiBit ("File -&gt; New wallet")  and set a password for the new wallet ("File -&gt; Add Password") 
* Import the exported keys ("Tools -&gt; Import private keys")
and then see what happens after its done synchronizing.
Can you remember what exactly you did to bring the wallet into this strange state? Maybe does the last transaction that adds 5 BTC not have a standard (pay-to-pubkeyHash) output script or something? Where did it come from?
You should also contact the author of MultiBit, if this is indeed a bug (looks like one) and if it is a very rare and still unknown bug then he might have a chance to find out what is causing it and fix it to make it even more reliable. All software needs bug reports from its users to become better.

I suggest staying with mBTC, its ~~a bit~~ slightly more than half a dollar and its also half an euro, so I find its quite handy. 
The µBTC already has too many zeros so you have the same problem on the other side of the decimal, it might be useful maybe in 5 years but not yet. 
And once you have trained how to do the factor 1000 calculation from BTC to milli without a pocket calculator then it will be **much easier** to do the same factor 1000 again in 5 years when price is at $1M per BTC and we need to migrate from milli to micro, you will be so used to it you can do the switch forth and back on the fly even while you sleep and by that time I guess the USA will have adopted the metric system anyways and children will learn it at school like they do in Europe already today.

Unfortunately I do not have a mac, so I must direct you to the bitcointalk forum: 
from there the solution is the following command in the terminal (make sure its not running before you do this)
    /Applications/Bitcoin-Qt.app/Contents/MacOS/Bitcoin-Qt -reindex
(then leave the terminal window open, because now its running from the terminal it would be closed if you close the terminal) this will take some time because now its reindexing the blockchain database and also might start downloading missing or corrupted blocks again if needed but should still be faster than beginning with a fresh installation from scratch.

Doesn't matter. Call them "units" or whatever, fact is there exists only a finite amount of them and to use the Bitcoin protocol you need to buy (or otherwise acquire ownership of) some of them, otherwise you just have a bunch of empty addresses and not much use for it. You need to buy (or otherwise acquire) bitcoins (or slots as he calls it in an act of abstraction which is essentially correct) to start using the system.

this is the option you supply on the command line when starting armory. You could make a script that starts it with that option or include the option in the starter (whatever OS you are using the starter that starts it when you click it should have an option to edit the command that is executed to add command line options to it)
Maybe some fundamental learning about computers (starting commands from the command line and stuff like that how that all relates to the rest of the things you do or could do with the computer) would be in order, you might have skipped some intermediate levels and jumped right into GUI usage without first understanding some underlying principles.
This is perfectly ok when doing only what end-users are nowadays supposed to do (this was not always the case, older people might remember) but it is not sufficient when you plan to get your hands dirty and want to deviate from the official recommended ways and manipulate things that happen under the hood, then you need to know what there is below this shiny colorful clickable desktop surface. Then you need to learn how to **talk** to the machine (in a dialog much like a written chat with real words and even sentences, not only silent point and click with the mouse).

There might be some confusion in the user interface, I just opened it again myself and might have remembered the exact wording of the options wrongly. The options are:
  * create new wallet
  * restore existing wallet from seed
  * create watch only version of existing wallet
The last one is what I actually referred to as "restore from MPK", this might have introduced confusion. Moreover it won't throw an error if you enter the MPK into the seed field, so be careful to select the right option. Fortunately you have to do it only once (and thats why I haven't seen this dialog for such a long time myself).
* So if you want to enter the seed (on the offline machine): choose "restore from seed"
* If you want to to enter the MPK (on the online machine): choose: "create watch only version"
Now try it again, also maybe write down the first addresses it generates (just to quickly compare them and see its actually really the same wallet), then try again "restore from seed" with the same seed, it should generate the same addresses. And it should generate the same mpk.
Then again delete the wallet and this time make sure you select "create watch only" instead of "restore from seed" and use the mpk instead of the seed. it should generate the exact same addresses and this time the wallet will be a watch only wallet.

Blockchain.info will send you backups of the keys to your email. It also allows you to easily get access to your wallet and all its keys from many different places and devices (including the email backups if you access your mail from different devices). This means a whole lot of different services and computers all around the world are involved in handling your private keys.
The key to manageable security lies in trying to keep the entire setup as **small** as possible to **reduce the attack surface** and the typical usage of blockchain.info accomplishes the exact opposite. It involves insecure web browsers with shoddy extensions and plugins, it involves the security of your email account, it involves access from different devices, mobile phones, 2fa of blockachain.info is circumvented when they can break into your email, it fails if there is a malicious browser plugin on the PC where you access the web wallet, etc. If any of the different components of such a complex setup is compromised then the security of the entire system is at risk.
If you keep your coins in an electrum wallet and a backup of the 12 seed words written on paper then only **one** computer is involved, no email accounts, no remote servers, no web browser, no additional devices with access to the keys, nothing. Only one computer and one piece of paper. This is much easier to keep under control.

look at this and compare: 
its similar. In the above linked example the command is grep and the option is -l
in your example the command is **Armory** and the option is --satoshi-datadir=/Volumes/nifty/Applications/Bitcoin
    Armory --satoshi-datadir=/Volumes/nifty/Applications/Bitcoin
try it. (or maybe its armory instead of Armory, not 100% sure)
Or maybe with the help of the open command, so we are starting it indirectly:
    open -a Armory --args --satoshi-datadir=/Volumes/nifty/Applications/Bitcoin
here the command is **open** and you pass it the options -a Armory --args --satoshi-datadir=/Volumes/nifty/Applications/Bitcoin which means you tell the "open" command to do something and that "something" is to start Armory and pass on to it all arguments that come after --args

* You don't use the "import" option on the wallet file. You use **"File-&gt;open wallet"** because its a wallet (hence the name ".wallet") and not a key export file (because then it would be named ".key").
* scan the AppData folders of **every** user! If this is not possible due to permission problems then boot a live cd and scan the entire hdd for *.wallet
And next time put your wallet files **into a folder you can remember, so you don't have to search for it** and make backup copies of the files every time you created a bunch of new keys. I cannot believe how you could hold such an enormous amount of money in a single file on your computer and **never cared about finding out in which folder this file is actually located and what file name it has**, let alone making a **backup copy** of that enormously important file.

That doesn't change the fact that these prefixes are defined in the SI standard. Its SI, no matter whether the people are aware of that detail or not.

All these schemes are essentially a variation of a similar problem: A calculation where you can easily calculate B from A but its impossible to simply do the reverse and calculate A from B. All you can do is to try all possible values of A and see whether it gives the correct B.
The sheer amount of possible values there are to try (think about the number of Atoms in the universe to get a rough impression of the size of numbers we are talking about here) makes this approach impractical. IIRC you would consume the energy of a supernova only to **count** the values (the energy needed just flipping the bits without even having done any calculations yet) and that makes brute forcing a little bit impractical.

* If there exists no such thing as "intrinsic value" then it doesn't matter anyways because everybody (including you) only ever cares about the market value, since this is the only thing of practical relevance and the only thing that can be quantified in numbers.

IMHO it will regulate itself. Currently every transaction costs $x amount of fees. The miners will demand and receive enough BTC to cover their mining costs, if the value of BTC is high then they will receive few of them, if it is low then they can demand more. Should it become the norm to transfer only 7 extremely valuable items per second then the fees can become pretty high and for the miners it won't matter whether they receive 1 BTC @ $10 or .00001 BTC @ $1M as long as they receive their $10 for every transaction. And if $10 is no longer enough to get a tx into a block then it will be $15 worth of BTC.

Also there should be **TONS** of reddit posts from people reporting that they were able to withdraw more money than they had in their account.
Remember when the database problem at cryptsy happened a few months ago: people could withdraw twice and immediately it was known on reddit and all over the forums. Also I can remember coinbase also once having an accounting problem and people were credited more coins than they really had, it was immediately reported by people on the forums.
And now imagine an exchange like MtGox was crediting random people their withdrawn coins back to their account automatically and this was going on FOR YEARS and NOBODY ever noticed or said a single word? I don't believe it! If it amounted to a total of 700k over multiple years then more than one person must have been involved and more than one skilled hacker must have been stumbled over this bug in their wallet during all the years and eventually someone would have released an ultimatum like this: "There is serious a flaw in MtGox that allows you to steal coins easily, I have notified them, I will give them 1 week time to fix it and then I will disclose all details of the attack, in the mean time please remove your money from gox, they are not safe".
Nothing of that (let alone on such a giant scale) has ever happened. If the cold wallet is really empty then it either was a theft that happened quickly (rogue employee?) or it was a catastrophic bug or human failure that resulted in simply losing the keys to the cold wallet addresses and they don't want to admit such utter failure (legal consequences?) and are trying to blame it on force majeure in order to not lose their face (as if this were still possible).

A lot of people are not tech savvy enough to understand all the implications, this is also obvious when you read threads about paper wallets, they suggest to each other stuff like: "download the website, disconnect, print the paper wallet, go online again" and similar nonsense. Many people really believe they are secure when they do this only because it contains the word "offline" and the instructions sometimes sound like they originate from a James Bond movie while they sometimes really do not accomplish anything at all!
I believe the best thing is to not give instructions that give users a false feeling of security because they are incomplete or don't address the real problem, it would be better to just explain the possible dangers if there is nothing the user could possibly do that would help: "There could be $xyz on your phone that would steal your seed when you enter it and there is nothing the app or you could possibly do about it, except not using it at all"

I read somewhere in old posts something about 24 hours but this can't be true anymore, I put 3TH/s on a public p2pool node a few days ago and it took more than 2 days until the payout reached the level I had calculated. I already began to suspect the node was cheating with the announced fees when it was still only 1/3 of my expected value after the first 24 hours.

I don't know. Maybe it is this idiotic cloud hype where people believe they need to store all their stuff online (documents, images, all files and now even money) to have it accessible from all their devices always and wherever they go. I personally cannot understand this, there is simply no need for most of these things to be accessible from everywhere all the time.
BTW: did you know you can even set up a two-computer-offline-signing setup with Electrum? Imagine you have 20 million dollars worth of Bitcoins stored in an Electrum wallet and have only the seed and now you need 1BTC to buy a new car: 
* You install electrum on an offline computer and enter the seed. It won't show the balance because its offline but it will show you the **master-public-key** of that wallet.
* you install another copy of electrum on an online computer and enter the master-public-key and it will show you the balance of your wallet but its a watch-only because it does not have the private keys.
* Now you make a transaction of 1BTC to the Ferrari dealer with the watch-only electrum, it will create a transaction but leave it unsigned (because it can't sign it without key), save the unsigned tx on an USB drive.
* load the tx with the offline Electrum, sign it, save it back to the USB
* load the signed tx with the online electrum, push it to the network.
* destroy the offline computer again, so all you have again is the seed
The simpler variant with lower tinfoil-level:
* boot online computer with Linux
* install electrum and enter seed
* make transaction
* shut down the computer again (optionally destroy it)

This is made up. His imported key is in position  and in Multibit this is the address that receives all the change. So his change is still on his paper. Also even if he managed to have change sent to a different address, it would still be inside the wallet and perfectly safe, he did only break the integrity of his his paper wallet, not the integrity of his MultiBit wallet. The thing that finally broke it was he **deleted** his wallet. Intentionally deleting a wallet file is not what I would call "breaking its integrity in subtle ways", I would rather call that "deleting the file".

Its a misleading headline, and its plain wrong.
Company A has become customer of small company B who also happens to have contracts with some banks for some obscure variation of online payment processing that nobody actually knows or uses in Europe. And these banks don't care much about Company B and their ~13.50€ per month turnover and don't even know about the existence of Company A, let alone their involvement in Bitcoin. 
This means this headline is grossly misleading (its actually outright wrong), the Banks did not **allow** anything, they probably don't even know about it (yet).

Is there already money in the wallet? Then you might need to expand the "used" category where it hides addresses that have already been used. It is generating new addresses when old ones have received payments, of course you can continue using the used ones, you just have to expand that category, its just encouraging you to use new addresses every time (but not forcing you). 
The offline copy can create all these same addresses too if it needs to (for example because you gave it a transaction to sign) but by default it only shows the first 5 addresses (but the normal use case is to use only the watch only version anyways to generate addresses and to create unsigned tx and the offline wallet is only used to sign the tx and not to display addresses and when asked to sign a tx it will figure out how many more to generate from the seed until it arrives at the one that is needed to sign, this happens automatically)

flip a coin 128 times (or even more) and then drill holes into a piece of metal (head=1=no hole, tail=0=hole). 
Then enter that sequence of 1 and 0 as an electrum seed on an offline linux computer to get the address (electrum will allow arbitrary long sequences of 1 and 0 as seed). Repeat it multiple times to be sure you don't have made a typo when typing in the sequence and make sure you end up with the same address every time.

Luckily the big mining pools do not own the ASIC power, its owned by thousands of people who want to spend their coins or sell them at the exchange to pay the electricity bill. So if for example GHash.io begins to mine on an alternative chain all the mining rewards they pay to their miners will be only valid on the alternative chain, they cannot be sent to bitstamp or mtgox or coinbase or spent at any merchant. They will immediately point their mining machines to one of the remaining conservative pools in order to continue earning spendable valid coins.

It is using the servers to:
* fetch the transaction history (for each address, for this it sends only addresses, NOT the keys)
* receive instant notification about incoming tx (also for this the server only needs the addresses)
* fetch the block headers for SPV proof

yes. It can not show balances offline, this is obvious, but it will generate addresses and the same seed will always result in the exact same addresses. And it will generate an MPK.
And the MPK generated by this offline wallet when brought to the online computer and there used in the "create watch only"-option will create a watch only wallet with all the exact same addresses and it will be able to show balances.
There is also a short instruction on the electrum website:  that says basically the same.
* bring the MPK to the online machine (txt file via USB)
* on the online machine select "Create a watching-only version of existing wallet" and enter the MPK
and if you compare the addresses it generates it will be identical.
and if you delete everything completely and start from scratch with the same seed:
* offline: "restore from seed" you will see: exact same wallet addresses

Seed, not passphrase. 
Otherwise: correct. Thats also What I recommend. Use Electrum and write down the seed (it actually forces you to write it down when creating a new wallet, so its impossible to forget this step) and then it does not matter anymore what happens to the computer, the wallet can be restored at any time using only the seed.

Spread out your buying over longer periods (months), buy only small amounts, do NOT try to find the one perfect moment, you cannot time the market with such accuracy. 
Don't look at the price charts at all, small fluctuations (+-30%) don't matter, just read this sub (1 minute a day, just a cursory look at the front page is enough) to get the reliable indicators:
* Put your buying on temporary hold and watch the roller coaster when the **moon season** begins (every other posting here in this sub containing the word "moon" or other astronomical bodies and everybody acting like they are out of their minds, happens at least once a year but not always at the same time). During this season you can spend more time on reddit to enjoy the amusement value, maybe even post a few moon postings yourself just for the fun of it but **RESIST** the temptation to buy more BTC. Buying is strictly on hold during this time!
* Slowly start buying again when the roller coaster has abruptly ended and everybody else (except you) is feeling sick and depressed and postings about suicide hotline numbers are being upvoted to the top. This will be the best time to begin buying again.

No one.
At most you see maybe a shadow or a hand or a silhouette from behind in a dark room while the camera is focused on a computer screen for a few seconds near the end of the movie. 
All kinds of mysterious people, a hacker, a high ranking politician, a secret government agent, an eccentric university professor, an attractive woman (!) appear throughout the plot and at first **seem** to play an important role and are all somehow related in some complicated way but later turn out to be probably (?) not relevant, in the end it remains a complete mystery and more questions are unanswered than before.
A man is found dead under mysterious circumstances who was believed to be the only one knowing his true identity, all kinds of odd conspiracies and enormous secret government operations seem to be uncovered as the plot unfolds but Satoshi's identity and his role in all this remains unknown.
They almost find him in the end but when they enter the room just a few seconds after he has escaped all they find is a computer, a green blinking cursor on an empty black screen, then a message appears: "I am not Satoshi Nakamoto".
The end.
And after all there must be enough room left for a sequel or two.

This is not the definition of "money laundering". 
Maybe you are referring to the traditional definition from many decades ago, it was indeed once meant to refer to the "aiding and abetting" aspect and a real crime was needed for money to become "dirty". But these days are long gone (in the USA at least, not yet in many other countries btw.). Today [in the USA] "money laundering" is defined as "using money without telling the [US] government about it".

This is true. But they will certainly not publish the results of their expensive analysis for free on the www. They will instead silently adjust their **own** positions (in this example they will silently begin to offload most of their WU stocks or even begin to build up a short position) and at the same time they will instruct the common sheep to buy it (from them).

Just boot it with a live CD. If your BIOS hasn't been manipulated in a very special way¹ then this is as close to 100% secure as you can possibly get. Even if your HDD were full of malware it would not be able to do any harm while you are booting from CD. If you are ultra paranoid then just remove (unplug) the HDD before booting from CD.
¹) "special way": NSA type of special, not the average bitcoin thief skill level. And if this were the case then even a newly bought and never used PC could be infected the same way, so it wouldn't make much difference. I would even argue that the older the PC the less advanced the backdoor contained in it will be (if there is any backdoor at all). We are bordering tinfoil hat area here already.

Don't use the same keys from multiple wallets / multiple places. This does not only make it harder to maintain the keys and introduce room for error, its also a recipe for complete disaster: The easier you make it to access the **same** coins (or all your coins) from multiple places and the more different computers and services you involve in handling the keys, the more likely it is that you mess up or forget something in your setup that makes it possible for someone to steal your coins remotely from the other end of the planet.
This is also why I do not recommend blokchain.info, it involves sending around backups of your keys through email halfway around the planet, it involves the security of your email credentials, it involves possible access of the wallet from remote locations, malicious browser extensions, etc and the **weakest** link will break the chain.
Put your coins into a local wallet that you control and can only control when you are physically present at this location.
You don't need full access to your entire wealth wherever you go every day or are you planing for the need to flee the country unexpectedly and in a hurry? Put a small amount into a mobile Wallet (I recommend Mycelium) for normal spending and put the rest into cold storage that cannot be accessed without you being physically present.

Many people have very different opinions how to properly secure the coins once you have bought them, they will suggest many different types of wallets and there really are a lot of different and sometimes really creative or even slightly paranoid and overcomplicated ways to store bitcoins and there are also ways to store them totally insecure and have them easily stolen. Thats why you get already 100 different answers when it comes to the question which wallet to use alone and the question how to buy them is not even touched at this point.
You need to find answers to these two questions separately
* which wallet to use (to receive/store/spend them once you have bought them)
* where to buy them
As far as the Wallet is concerned I recommend Electrum. It has some properties that make it especially easy to use and secure, the most important feature is the seed: It will generate 12 english words (which is called the seed) you are supposed to write them down on paper and put them into a deposit box or other secure location and always keep them secret, show them to nobody since this is the key to your wallet. Should your computer explode and your house burn to the ground all you need is this 12 words seed on a new computer and you restore full access to all your coins.
You will also see other recommendations for other wallets but from me you will only hear this one recommendation since I personally believe its the best wallet for most people, difficult to lose your coins, hard to steal them (cannot remember any reported case of theft from an Electrum wallet yet), very good for beginners and also advanced users like it.
For Android phones I recommend Mycelium.
As far as buying is concerned, look for exchanges in Europe: Kraken and Bitstamp come to mind or buy them uncomplicated privately for cash from people you meet on localbitcoins.com (you will meet people in person and exchange a small amount of cash, choose a meeting place not in a dark back alley at night, instead choose a place in public, maybe in the foyer of a bank or right in front of the police station, after all you are not doing anything illegal, you can do it in broad daylight) or find people on the market that is built into the Mycelium Android wallet application.
Edit: one thing I forgot to mention: you will want to take computer security a little bit more serious than before from now on, I think you can easily boost the security from 0 to 99% with applying common sense and generally recommended security practices and the remaining 1% will then be the separate offline computer that never connects to the internet, this depends on how good you are at keeping your computer clean, I personally have an old laptop from 2007 for my bitcoin needs, its not strictly always offline (some people insist that offline is the only way but I do not deem this necessary in my case), it is running Linux instead of Windows and is not used for anything other than my Electrum wallet.

Most of it is not needed at all. With some very basic and easy to follow procedures and habits (or even just the breaking of some old insecure habits) its already possible to boost the security from 0 to 99.9% and only the remaining 0.1% is where all the complicated hyper paranoid instructions can give any further improvements.
If you look at all the threads here where users post about their disappeared bitcoins its basically always because they used web wallets on malware infested windows computers. Find a solution to that one problem and you have instantly solved 99.9% of end user security problems. Then and only then it makes sense to talk about dumb printers and other borderline tinfoil-hat or ultra high security measures to attack the remaining 0.1%.

Use the context menu "add" to add the keys one by one. Then check all their balances individually online (and their creation date) (also available through the context menu) and then finally save it to a new *.wallet file.

**There is only one authority** that could ever be allowed to issue stuff like passports or certifications or hold elections and publish the results and this is the block chain!
How about this: **proof-of-uptime**: instead of proving a sacrifice how about rewarding long running nodes or nodes that have relayed a lot of transactions for a long time with colored Satoshis to a dedicated address of this node. Upon connect the node would would sign a response to a challenge with this key/address and the other node can then look up the "trust"-level and the age of this address in the block chain.
We are making a lot of propaganda of how useful a global decentralized trustworthy ledger is and how all kinds of important stuff can be recorded and certified there because we have finally solved the consensus problem and now we have something that needs to be recorded or certified in a secure and trustworthy manner and the first thing he comes up with is invoking the government to do it for us instead of using our **own** cool new technology of global consensus.

Keys are not supposed to "be on the internet" and normally this also does not happen unless your computer is compromised in which case even the short time during which you sweep the paper wallet might be enough to steal everything.

The short answer is you don't have to wait, you can send the money now and it will succeed and confirm long before sync is complete.
when you spend then you are spending the outputs of previous payments to you. When your wallet is half synced and the incoming payments that are already visible happen to be still unspent, if it is for example synced until January and you are only waiting for the last few months to sync up and you know for a fact that you did not **spend** money between January and today (receiving does not matter) then you can just try to make a transaction, it will go through, and confirm long before the sync is complete. 
But if you did spend or move some of it after January and the wallet does not yet see this then the transaction will not succeed, the transaction will be constructed from outdated data, it will be a double spend and be considered invalid. But this should not be the case if this is just a normal catch-up after last usage and not a full restore from backup.
So just try it, it will either succeed or not. You can't lose coins either way. Once the sync is complete you will know. The tx will either succeed or it will be dismissed by the network entirely. If you did not use the same wallet on multiple computers in parallel (not recommended) then there is no reason why the old coins should have moved while you were away anyways, so it will probably just work.
So the general answer if do not have a very unusual setup and doing things that lie far outside the usual routine of how to use a wallet or are not currently restoring a backup from scratch then the answer is: No, you don't have to wait another 10 hours, yes you can just send money right away after starting the wallet and it will succeed even if its not yet fully synced. And no matter what, you cannot lose any money, even if it fails, the worst possible outcome is you have to wait until its complete and then try again.

You should also learn a few statically typed languages. Although they first feel harder to use they will also give you more confidence in the correctness of your code and after some time will even feel easier and more relaxed to work with than any dynamic language could ever do. Choose a modern language with compile time type inference to reduce the boilerplate (for example Kotlin or Xtend instead of Java or Go instead of C++, otherwise the experience might suffer).

Every determined attacker who has the means to pull off such an attack will be able to come up with a dozen different original government issued passports.
I understand what problem you are trying to solve but this is obviously not the solution, its a half-baked attempt of a workaround that does not even work. And even if it worked it would be really lame if we needed to rely on some government to keep parts of the network running because our inability to come up with a proper solution. 
Bitcoin is about **decentralization**, so a solution is needed that does not need any other authority than the **distributed consensus**, the block chain itself!
Back to the drawing board! There must be a better way than asking big brother to do it for us. We have come so far already, we should be able to find a proper solution for this remaining small problem too! Let's call it "Hearn's passport problem" from now on.

Mycelium for Android is quite good. It will force you to make an encrypted backup on paper (a PDF that you are supposed to print, it will nag you with a button until you followed the backup procedure and scanned it successfully to verify its correctness). This way its almost impossible to lose your keys, even if you reset your phone.
For the desktop I recommend Electrum, it also forces you to write down the seed (can be used to restore the keys) on a piece of paper and verifies that you wrote it down correctly, also almost impossible to lose (if you can manage to securely store a piece of paper).
As you can see I am putting a strong emphasis on backup because from what I seem to observe here is that a missing backup seems to be the most common reason for people to lose their money, even more common than loss through bitcoin stealing malware on an infected PC.

Do you know the exact amount of bitcoins there should be in the wallet? If so then you could load the wallet.dat with **wallet-key-tool** (github/prof7bit) and then save it as Multibit .wallet. Then open that with Multibit (will sync within 5 minutes), then **make sure the balance is correct**, then either continue using Multibit or use it to transfer all funds to a different wallet of your choice.
After this do not continue to use the old wallet.dat, archive a copy of it somewhere just in case you still need it later for some recovery just in case it turns out someone sends you a few satoshi to an old address but do not use these imported keys in 2 wallets in parallel since this can lead to weird effects.
Never delete a wallet file, even if you don't use it anymore keep a copy of it in a safe place, just in case.

This is actually not true at all. Quite the opposite: The phones have a much more rigorous security model than desktop computers.

Related but maybe not so useful in this case: mounting an entire partition directly into this place.

charge fees.
If this does not help then enjoy the profit and increase the fees even more until it helps.
Also this is not just about you intentionally double spending, the much bigger threat is you will **become a target for law enforcement**, because they would rightly (!) determine you are in charge and in full control of **all** Bitcoin mining they could force you to freeze a bitcoin address by not mining certain tx and force you to orphan any block that tries to mine that tx and you would have to comply! All other pools would then have no other choice than teeth-gnashingly filter these same tx too to be able to continue any mining at all and then we would have PayPal V2.0, **you** would be the go-to person for all law enforcement in the world for every bitcoin transaction and transaction reversal and probably also need to hire 42 more lawyers just to get the daily legal paperwork done. You could even suddenly find yourself at the very center of international conflicts regarding "terrorists", "dictators", etc. Are you willing to wear that shoe? If not then scale back NOW!
Maybe the needed lawyers and all the other costs associated with being a global money transmitter will finally force you to charge a hefty fee from your miners and hopefully solve the problem.

No. The suggestion of the "bit" proponents is to switch the base unit or introduce an arbitrary new unit. This is not necessary because the metric system allows to use prefixes m and µ.
Thats also the reason why we need only one length unit [meter] in Europe and can cover the whole range with micrometer, millimeter, meter, kilometer. Nobody in his right mind would ever propose a separate name for kilometers or millimeters, sometimes people call the micrometer "micron" or just "µ" [mŷː] but thats not a new name, it just the equivalent of saying "milli" instead of "millibitcoin" or "cent" instead of centidollar.
I would be moderately comfortable with a nickname like "micron" or "mü" or "µ" or even "micky" or "mic" or anything else that at least vaguely preserves and hints some association with "micro"or "µ" but "bit" is absolutely unsuitable for the many reasons mentioned already hundreds of times in all these other threads about this topic.

Or is this really a full p2pool node?
@_date: 2015-01-27 18:21:27
Yes, exactly. 
One of them will arrive before the other at the miner who will mine the next block, the second transaction will then just be ignored and discarded because it spends already spent inputs.
And even the non-mining full nodes of ordinary users in the network will discard and not propagate the second transaction once they have seen and forwarded the first one.
And even if it happens that two miners on opposite ends of the world mine a new block at exactly the same time, each one containing one of the two competing transactions then there would still no bad things happen because then the usual mechanisms apply for deciding which one of the two competing chain forks will be the one that eventually survives.

You can't buy it because you can only buy at the lowest ask. You need to buy up **all** other asks until the one at $1100 is the cheapest one.

The most foolproof way to spend from a paper wallet is to use a software that explicitly has an option specifically designed for this purpose. IMHO currently the only user-friendly software in existence that can do that is Mycelium for Android. I strongly recommend using that for spending your paper wallets.
Of course you can also manually move around keys in other wallets such as Bitcoin-Qt or MultiBit or Electrum if you know what exactly you are doing and know where to look to see whats going on but I would not call that user friendly or fool proof. People have lost money while trying to do manually what more appropriate software would have done automatically for them.

Yes. Some people make screenshots, some write it down, some people don't do any of the above, then lose or factory reset the phone and are screwed. This code is what you need to set up the google authenticator on a new device. The app keeps it in private storage, to get it back if you didn't write it down you would need to root the phone.


I have not yet heard about any reports of successful remote bitcoin or google auth theft from a phone. Apps are sandboxed and it seems (at least for now) too difficult for the average bitcoin thief to break through this barrier.
If you want it 100% paranoid then use a tablet that has no GSM/UMTS at all (removing the SIM would not be enough on that paranoia level) to prevent any theoretical attacks through the shoddy GSM/UMTS/baseband stacks and also do not install any other apps than google auth (and/or your preferred bitcoin wallet if you also need a wallet on the device). 
Wifi should unproblematic, it can't be remotely exploited without help from the inside (malicious app) but if you want to go 100% paranoid and suspect you have powerful enemies in the highest government and intelligence circles (who want to steal your 3 BTC and find it easier to waste a precious secret zero-day exploit against the Linux network stack (if such a thing even still exists after all these years) to get your coins instead of just seizing them from the exchange directly or by simply applying some waterboarding techniques to make you help them "voluntarily") you would want to disable that too.
The biggest danger for real people in the real world is probably just losing the device or having it stolen.

The situation in the US seems much worse than in Europe. Here we just log into our bank account (or use the banking app on the phone), fill out an online form with exactly 3 fields: destination IBAN, amount to send and optionally a small text message and click "send". And the IBAN number (which uniquely identifies any bank account at any bank anywhere) is almost as long as a Bitcoin address. And it is usually completely free, at some banks it may cost a few cents. It would not even come to anybodies mind here to use a check for anything, most people haven't even seen a check since the advent of the internet. After 24 hours (sometimes much less or instantly when within the same bank) the money is in the destination account. So the US banking problems are not representative for fiat banking in general, its just that the US seems to have the worst banking infrastructure by a wide margin on this entire planet.

You can click on the menu item "File"-&gt;"Open Wallet", then browse to the folder where you keep your wallet file, select it and click OK.
In case you can't remember where this is then just start up the old version and look at the "messages" Tab, there near the top shold be a line reading "Opening wallet "/folder/that/contains/your/wallet/walletname.wallet...". Go to that folder, this is where your money is stored, this is also what you need to backup in case anything goes wrong.

It is only deterministic how the multiverse as a whole develops but it is not deterministic from the point of view of one single observer traveling along the tree of universes through time, it is up to the observer which one of his multiple instances he chooses to consciously follow and call "self". This gives the impression of free will and for all practical intents and purposes it IS free will. And as a side effect it also allows the observer to "influence" events with multiple possible outcomes solely by the power of his mind, only by choosing which universe he wants to observe. If I choose to follow a path to a universe where Bitcoin has surpassed $4000 and I will own a 3 figure amount of them then I (the copy of me that I like most and that I want to call "myself") can end up exactly there. 
And I have managed to end up here.
And next I am going to one of the universes where Bitcoin mass adoption will have taken place and where a future copy of me will have reached total financial independence. This universe will exist and this future copy of me will exist and I am going to call it myself (and ignore all my other selfs). This is free will. And this is also "manipulating" matter with the power of the mind. 
It has brought me this far and it will bring me even further. Unfortunately nobody else can observe my voyage through the multiverse, unless he chooses to follow me. Therefore it is impossible to demonstrate this concept to others.
BTW: There is also the concept of a russian quantum roulette machine, it is a machine that will instantly kill you if its random number generator doesn't output the keys to Satoshi's fortune on the first try. It will kill you in all universes except one. Thats the universe where your self will end up after you press the button. Froum your point of view you press the button and its random number generator instantly displays the keys to Satoshi's wallet.
This also means we all are basically immortal, there will always be universe where we will live just a moment longer, but this aspect is somewhat frightening, I don't yet know how to avoid this, maybe we can also choose to exit the mutiverse at some point.

None of the existing ones do, this is the wallet file format of the old and abandoned Multibit.
You can open the file in Multibit Classic, export all the keys from within Multibit and then import them in many other wallets that support random unrelated keys. You can also alternatively use "wallet key tool" to extract the keys from the file and export them in other formats.
Recently I have emptied my old Multibit wallet, it had 20 or so keys in it:
* I made a new Electrum wallet with no seed (a wallet that is not HD and shall only serve as a container to hold a random bunch of keys)
* I exported my keys from Multibit and imported these keys into this new Electrum wallet
* After I made sure the balance showed up exactly the same in Electrum as it did in Multibit I sent all the money with a normal transaction to my other every-day wallet (also Electrum).
* Then I uninstalled Multibit.
* The Electrum wallet with the imported keys now takes the place of the old Multibit for me
* I keep my normal Electrum wallet (with seed) and  this random-bunch-of-keys-wallet as different wallets because only the seed wallet can be backuped completely on a piece of paper, the wallet with the imported keys must be backuped as a file. Only the seed wallet is supposed to hold money, the other one is usually empty.
The main reason I did it this way and not just threw away the old keys altogether (after emptying it) is that I want to keep the old addresses and their keys still around just in case somebody sends a few millibitcoins to one of my many old buy-me-a-beer addresses (this still happens once or twice a year). Now I can look at these addresses twice a year with my Electrum wallet instead of the old buggy Multibit.

If you want to do it then do **not** do it **now**, the timing is wrong!
Every once in a while the price begins to make a sudden parabolic upward move large enough to trigger all these "should I buy now" posts from unexperienced traders. You suddenly feel like missing the boat and feel the urge to buy. Resist it!
Don't let your fears (missing the boat) or your greed (could make millions) take control over your decisions! Resist it!
Buy only between these upward spikes when it is calm and moving sideways for months or even going down for months, when everything is moving so slow that you have plenty of time to analyze the market and calculate your risk.

The myth originates from the recent BIP9 debacle. Miners were given a temporary option to delay a softfork until they all had the upgrade installed and promptly they abused it as a veto right to intentionally delay it and from this time on this myth that miners had any say in protocol matters was born.
Bip9 is history now, miners have no influence anymore, that mistake of ever giving miners a tool like BIP9 again will certainly not be repeated by any coin, but for some reasons this myth is kept alive. People still think that miners have a vote in such matters but this is false. Miners' only job is to seal transactions by piling difficult blocks onto each other, users' job is to validate that all these blocks are correct within all rules and discard and ignore blocks that are not. That's all. That's how Bitcoin and most other block-chain coins are working.
Probably it will need a long time and many examples to demonstrate to the users that this stupid myth is just a myth.

Then it should not be designed in such a way that it automatically overtakes all SPV wallets without their user's consent and sell such attack as "smooth upgrade". If you have such massive support in the user base as you claim then you can just tell them to **install** your update and make this a requirement.
If one wants to update to Windows 10 (or Debian unstable or whatever other Software) then he installs the update himself, if one does not want it and it gets installed anyways (and financial harm is created) then this is the very same situation.
The entire 2X fork should be Opt-In, if it still succeeds under these conditions then you can claim victory, but just pushing it onto unsuspecting users by exploiting an SPV wallet weakness with the help of 51% miner attack then it is extremely foul play, but in this case Bitcoin (Satoshi's vision) would be dead anyways because it could not protect its users against such massive manipulation.
Edit: BTW why doesn't this hardfork not also contain PoW change? This would be the perfect opportunity. This would also help proving that its not a 51% miner attack.

No, bitcoins design was that every node was a validating node. A 51% attack could not make wallets switch over to an invalid chain, 51% miners could still pull some dirty tricks but not change the protocol itself, the invalid blocks would just have disappeared in Nirvana.
The problem today is that nobody wants to validate the chain anymore they just want to use it like PayPal and delegate the validation to a handful of CEO overlords. In such an environment Bitcoin can not survive, a handful of CEOs can change the software on a whim and all users blindly follow.

This doesn't seem to impress our friends from the other sub very much, they seem hell-bent on going through with their 51% attack, even if it means complete chaos and all SPV wallets unpredictably switching the chain.
They even invented a new word for this, it is no longer called "51% attack", they now call it "Nakamoto consensus" and misleading all non-validating SPV wallets onto the wrong chain to cause chaos has gotten a new name too, its now called "smooth transistion".

if you are sure you don't need those old addresses anymore you can do this. It might take a while (many hours) until Multibit has synced again if it was not used for a long time but this would be possible.
If you have adresses of which you suspect you could still  receive money with them you would better not delete the wallet entirely. For example I still have some old addresses where people could buy me a beer, I put these addresses in the about boxes of some of the old software tools I wrote years ago, some of them might still be around and indeed once in a while I still receive small donations with them so I want to keep these old addresses forever. That's why I have chosen to migrate all these keys into a separate Electrum wallet because Multibit is not maintained anymore.

The idea to give the miners BIP9 as a temporary tool to delay soft fork activation was the mistake. They promptly abused this tool as a veto instrument, even if it was only temporarily and only for this one softfork, they suddenly believed they had any influence or any say in that matter. We gave them the little finger and they took the entire hand!
Luckily this is ended now, this temporary veto power has expired and the miners are only miners again like they used to be all the time.
Unfortunately they (and a lot of their followers) have not fully understood all this yet and continue to believe they have any say in protocol matters and they continue to "signal" all kinds of nonsense now although the miner survey has ended and no signals are currently defined and requested from them in the protocol at the current time and so their funny "signals" have zero effect.
I doubt such a mistake will ever be repeated, we won't give them such dangerous tools like BIP9 veto ever again. We will just softfork when needed, they will be forced to follow anyways.

The true reason is that unless something better than Bitcoin arrives it will remain longterm bullish (as it has already been all the time of its existence).
This means that it was **inevitable** that it eventually break the 1000.
This also means that it must eventually make a new all-time high.
And this also means that it will eventually break 2000, 4000, 8000, 16000, etc. until something comes along and stops it. I don't see anything capable of stopping it on the horizon, so it is bound to make higher and higher highs until the reason for its longterm bullishness is removed.

Except that currently there is no BIP9 or similar signaling survey active at the moment, nobody is asking the miners for their opinion at the moment, they can continue to signal whatever they want. No signaling bits were requested by the protocol, so any signaling won't have any effect.

Most users of Bitcoin nowadays are relatively new users who have only a vague understanding or no understanding of Bitcoin at all, these noobs are now the vast majority of users. The old users are still there but they didn't replicate themselves fast enough they are now a minority.
Bitcoin was meant to be controlled by the majority of its users. The assumption was that no single entity could convince the vast majority of users to simultaneously install a modified version of Bitcoin node software that goes against their interests. 
When Bitcoin was still small in the early days most of its users knew what they were doing and what they wanted. Miner centralization above 30% already raised loud alarm bells, 51% attack scenarios were discussed in all depth by all users and the possible dangers understood by most of them.
Today the vast majority of users does not understand what their own responsibility is in maintaining Bitcoin's integrity, they try to use it like PayPal, they let Bitcoin Banks (like Coinbase, etc.) manage their coins, they do not make their own decisions, they delegate all important decisions to their Bitcoin banks or wallet services and accept whatever they deem necessary. A 51% attack scenario is no longer discussed as a possible danger, now suddenly there is even the notion that miners should control bitcoin (imagine that!), these users are easily manipulated into just accepting the greatest nonsense, they believe in the benevolent dictator (Jihan Wu) and because Bitcoin is controlled only by its users the users have the power to kill it and they **are** going to kill it. because they have been told to do so.
If the B2X 80% attack succeeds and everybody blindly accepts it and Bitcoin then has its CEO (Jihan) who can dictate the rules of the protocol and nobody opposes then Bitcoin can be considered a failed experiment.
When this attack on Bitcoin succeeds without a fight and everybody hails the new **Bitcoin CEO who can push updates to the protocol on a whim with his giant ASIC farms** against no resistance then I'm out. I'm going to watch what the old bitcoin veterans who still believe in crypto are going to do next and will take my money there.
Bitcoin can only live when it has a healthy user base that actually cares and actively keeps it running. If the majority of users don't care about Bitcoin anymore at all and let **others** run it on their behalf and even those others (wallet providers) don't really care anymore and just accept whatever fork is pushed from the Chinese mega mines, if this successfully happens then Bitcoin will be dead.

They change only when the fundamental design of bitcoin and its components, how its parts work and and how they influence and balance each other were altered. But these fundamental mechanics have not changed since the beginning and thats why Bitcoin is still robust.


Miners do not initialte or even influence these protocol changes, this is neither their purpose nor do they have the power to do it. Protocol changes are initiated and enforced by users. Miners will follow and mine what the users want because that is their only purpose and the only thing they can do. If it were different and miners had any say at all then Bitcoin would have failed long ago already.

Its just an ASIC that does x hashes per second. Anybody who can build ASICs could and would use the same trick, now that its publicly known.

But for all intents and purposes this is experienced as a one-dimensional linear flow of time. And it also feels like the surrounding universe can be influenced by simply actively choosing which path to follow along the tree of forking universes. I actually don't care about all my other selves, I only care about the one I can experience here and now and it seems I can influence which one of my future selves I (whoever that is) will be experiencing tomorrow. 
And because it is not the universe that is moving or changing but my consciousness is moving along this large tree in the direction of positive time, choosing which exact path to follow, "I" (whoever that is) should theoretically be able to "influence" the physical world (within the laws of physics) no matter the distance, simply with the power of my "mind" (whatever that is). And it seems indeed "I" have made use of this power already more than once, mostly unintentional, I cannot yet control it. Fear seems to have a very strong effect, situations you fear will "manifest" (or these universes will attract you) more often than not. Maybe this is the key to gain control over it. Maybe this is also the way THEY are controlling us (in their reality).

They will be forced to start from scratch, their expensive and highly specialized ASICs could not be used and not be modified for the new PoW anymore, their ASICs would turn into door stops over night. 
It is be beyond words to describe how much satisfaction it would cause me and most others to watch Jihan's millions worth of ASIC farms go down the drain and watch him learn this painful lesson. 
The playing field for miners would be completely level again. And ideally the new PoW would be designed in such a way that it is much harder to develop cheap ASICs for it and maybe also such that its main limiting factor is not the amount of electric energy you can put into it (favoring only few places with cheap electricity) but something else that is more widely accessible and independent of location.

correct until here


Don't open the key file from here. You see a large text box. Do not use the open file button, instead copy&amp;paste the keys into this text box, one key per line. To get the keys to copy you open the .key export file in a **text editor** (for example notepad). You will see one line per key but each key has a timestamp at the end of the line. **Remove the timestamp from each line**, so all that remains is one key per line.
Then copy&amp;paste all the keys into the text box in Electrum and click the next button.
Note that for this to work you must export the keys unencrypted, so leave the password field empty when exporting the keys in Multibit. Do this only on a computer of which you know for sure that it is not compromised (maybe you can install a fresh linux on an old laptop that wont be used for anything else for doing such sensitive private key manipulation). Make sure you safely delete all traces of the unencrypted .key file afterwards from your harddrive, wipe free disk space after deleting! Make sure your new Electrum wallet has a password set, so you can safely move the file around without worry. 
Make multiple backup copies of your password protected wallet file(s) and keep them in multiple locations, maybe even different houses. Don't tell anybody where they are hidden. Use strong passwords. Don't forget your passwords.

I think this is the equivalent of "Tools" -&gt; "Export private Keys" in Multibit Classic.
This generates a simple text file with one key and a time stamp per line and the entire file is then encrypted with AES (there are some hints on StackExchange how to decrypt this  manually, search Google for decrypt Schildbach Wallet Backup)
AFAIK it should be possible to use MultiBit Classic Tools -&gt; Import private keys to decrypt and import it into an existing wallet. If this succeeds you can then export the keys from Multibit again (this time without encryption as plain text) or use wallet key tool on the Multibit wallet to extract some or all keys and save them in a different format.

The SI system exists to solve that problem, every unit of everything can be split in thousandths, millionths, etc. without touching the base unit or introducing new base units, simply put an "m" or a "µ" in front of it. 
Messing around with the base unit itself instead would be nonsense and totally confusing to everybody when there is already a perfect solution that is in widespread use all around the planet and every kid already has learned in school how to use them.

The block chain does not fit the definition of "party", no matter how far one stretches the definitions. And "The Miners" is not one single entity acting in a coordinated way, it is a crowd of people who are controlled by their greed and as a whole will act in a predictable way (which is the reason why Bitcoin is working in the first place).


There is free will and quantum physics provides an explanation for why it is possible to observe something that is (in the observer's own Universe) indistinguishable from randomness and the very same mechanism that provides this randomness is also the mechanism by which free will allows us to choose which outcome (which Universe) of the possible outcomes we are going to observe and therefore even gives us the power to influence "the future" (only each one's own individual future actually) by using only the mind (either in a controlled manner, not many people are able to do this, or subconsciously through hope and fear). BTW: This is also the same mechanism that makes it seem like the price drops every time after you bought a significant amount.

Moore's law has nothing to do with bitcoin price.
And your math is wrong:
10 years are 120 months. This would be 6.66 doublings according to your so-called "law".
Today the price is $4700
after 6.66 doublings it would be $4700 * 2^6.66 = **$475289**

And nobody stops you or your friends from giving the SI prefixed amounts simpler slang names but in written communications the SI prefixes should be used to express small numbers because they are universal and international and **well defined** and in most other areas it is done with SI prefixes already for a long time, for example the unit of length is the meter, nobody would invent a new unit for small distances, everybody and his grandma just uses millimeter. And the precision mechanic even uses micrometers every day in his job. And the semiconductor manufacturers use nanometer and nobody has a problem with it.
It has been discussed thousands of times already, there simply is no need to make up a new unit, define it officially and make people all over the world learn it and thereby cause lots of confusion and misunderstandings when there exists one already for at least 200+ years that everybody knows and that can easily be used.

Has the Android wallet become a HD wallet now? I haven't used it in ages. The old version in the early days was like Multibit (Classic) it generated random new keys on request and stored all keys in the wallet file. The file format (when extracted from the phone with the help of root) and renamed to .wallet was the same file format as Multibit Classic for the PC, it used the same bitcoin SPV-Node implementation from Google/Hearn that Multibit classic used.
You can also extract the keys with "wallet key tool" (a tool I once wrote, google it, its on github) and export in other formats.
Speculation: If it now uses a seed then maybe try to use Multibit HD.
Or maybe I misunderstopod and you tried to open the Android wallet with Multibit HD? Try to open it with the old Multibit Classic instead! Or try to open it with "Wallet Key Tool".

I moved my BTC cold storage to a new cold storage, set up a VM for the BCH wallet and began dumping BCH in batches of 10 (later 20) on Bitfinex the entire day until ~22:00 (and continuing today with the second half). I had no time to put my clothes on, so I did all this while being butt naked. Throwing around 5 $figures worth of pumped Altcoin half way around the planet to dump them for BTC in Hong Kong and simultaneously teleport the earned bitcoins straight  back into my cold storage at home instantly, all this  while being butt naked is a **financial experience** I can only recommend to everybody.

Imagine this scenario: A market square with several vegetable vendors selling fresh tomatoes:
* Vendor 1: $ 3.39 (has 50kg to sell)
* Vendor 2: $ 3.29 (has 20kg to sell)
* Vendor 3: $ 3.19 (has 20kg to sell)
* Vendor 4: $ 2.99 (has 10kg to sell)
You come along looking for tomatoes, buy 2kg from vendor 4 for a price of 2.99, this is the current market price for tomatoes on this market. Everybody who wants to buy can buy a kg of tomatoes for 2.99. Vendor 4 has 8 kg left to sell for this price.
Now a whale comes along and wants to buy 100kg Tomatoes. He buys 8 from vendor 4, now vendor 4 is out of stock, then 20 from vendor 3, then 20 from vendor 2, then 2 from vendor 1. All vendors are out of stock and close their booth for today except for vendor 1 who still has some tomatoes left to sell. The last kg was exchanged for 3.39, this is the new tomato price, there are no cheaper tomatoes left on this market. The whale has driven up the prices by simply buying up all cheaper tomatoes so only the expensive ones are left.
This is how it works.
If you place a limit sell order on an exchange then this is the equivalent of opening your own booth, writing a price on it and **waiting** for buyers. You are a "liquidity provider" (you provide liquidity), also called "market maker", you **make** the prices, you pay the maker fees to the exchange (often cheaper than taker fees, sometimes no fees at all, exchanges want to attract as many liquidity providers as possible) and you usually also end up getting a better price but you usually have to wait a while until someone happens to come along and accept your offer.
If you are in a hurry and take the next best cheapest sell offer immediately or sell to the highest bidder immediately then you are a "liquidity consumer" or "market taker", you just accept the prices made by others, also you pay the taker fees for the trade (usually a bit higher than maker fees) but you don't have to wait. The exchange will always automatically route you to the currently cheapest ask (sell offer) when you click "buy" or to the highest bid when you click the "sell" button, then if it is exhausted to the next lowest ask or the next highest bid and so on until your market order is completely filled.
The currently open buy and sell oders of the market makers are listed in the **order book**. Each market place has its own order book and therefore its own prices, that can sometimes significantly vary from each other, depending on the local circumstances, demand and supply. You can watch such orderbooks live on websites like bitcoinwisdom for each market place.

Bitcoins are transacted by creating a **transaction** that would transfer x amount **from A to B** and **sign** that with a signature that identifies you as the owner of A. Then broadcast that signed transaction to the public and wait until someone includes it in the next block. From then on it is official and everybody can see that B is the new owner because A signed it over to him.
For being able to sign a transaction that moves coins from A to B you must be in possesion of the **private key** that belongs to A. Everybody who knows the private key for A can create signatures for it and move coins away from A. Ideally this is only you and nobody else.
**A wallet** is an application that securely holds a collection of such private keys to manage them, list their corresponding bitcoin addresses, their current balances and create and sign transactions (send coins to somewhere else).
The wallet seed represents a large (extremely large) random number, it is so extremely large that nobody could accidentally come up with the same number, not even intentionally, not in a million years. From this large number an infinite **sequence of private keys** can be generated **deterministically** with the help of some very clever math (and with each key also its corresponding Bitcoin address). Deterministically means if you use the same seed on a different computer in a different application that uses the **same algorithm** (for example BIP 39) then it will come up with the exact same sequence of keys and addresses, it can look up the balances for these addresses in the network and it allows you to sign transactions (full control of your coins) with these private keys.
This means for safely storing your bitcoins all you really need is a **piece of paper to write down the seed** (paper wallet), or maybe engrave it in metal to make it fire proof, or maybe just memorize the seed without writing it down (brain wallet).
The wallet files are just for convenience, you don't have to enter the seed words every tiime you start your wallet app and they also store additional information like for example little text notes next to each transaction, the Bitcoin network does not store such notes, it only handles the addresses and the transacted amounts of BTC and nothing else, so if you restore a wallet from the seed you will see the full transaction list and have full control but all optional info like names and notes next to the tx will not be there.
I suggest you do some more reading in the various Bitcoin beginner FAQs (start with the links in the side bar) and maybe also additional literature linked from there to get at least a rough idea how bitcoin transactions work, what a wallet application actually is and what it does and what makes this entire system so very different from all other forms of value transfer and what implications, advantages, disadvantages and new possibilities this has for you and for the economy as a whole.

If you want to do day trading then look for exchanges that allow instant execution with low fees (because no transfer happens at all, it all happens only in their books). 
Converting between fiat and Crypto on Coinbase is not intended for day trading, it is too slow and unreliable, fees are too high.
If you want to invest long term then wait until half a year before the next bubble, then buy (wherever you want) then transfer it home to your own wallet, bury the keys in the garden and wait for the next 1000% increase.

Not good:
* The window decoration and borders are missing and the Window control buttons (upper right corner) must belong to the window decoration (on some desktops they are on the left side instead of right, and some don't even have an "X" at all but something else instead) and therefore this must be drawn by the Window manager according to the currently selected **desktop theme** and not by the application itself.
* The widgets, texts and colors don't follow the currently used Desktop theme look and feel, it doesn't look like a native application anywhere, it won't integrate well into the desktop.

If this happens we can change PoW and they can do nothing about it.
Miners have been doing what they were supposed to do for all the years since its existence until they were accidentally given a veto right through bip 9, a power which was never supposed to be in the hands of miners and which endangers (destroys) the carefully architected consensus mechanism and game theory feedback loop that was conceived by the ingenious Satoshi.
The miners quickly realized this and promptly exploited this newly gained power to start a revolt.
Luckily the revolt has been averted with the help of the segwit2 "agreement" trick, the veto power has been taken away from them again.
In the future no such veto powers should ever be given to them again (the only right they are supposed to have is to mine or not to mine) and everything will be back to normal.

Yes. A lot of people have not understood how bitcoin works. It works by letting the market FORCE the miners to do what  needs to be done to secure the chain.

Nobody wants to separate the miners from Bitcoin and it is an integral part of the design of bitcoin and the reason why it works that miners do not have any influence on protocol decisions.

Its common with anything that has a log-normal distribution, so basically anything you find in nature or in economy that is strictly positive and has no upper bound.

@_date: 2017-06-06 07:27:32
Whenever something is strictly positive and has no upper bound then you have a strong candidate for a log scale plot. When you then observe that the values seem to follow a log-normal distribution and it is obvious that the underlying model is NOT additive, then it is almost certain that a logarithmic y-axis is more appropriate than a linear one and should be used. All the above is true for market prices, thats why quants mostly use log plots.

@_date: 2013-06-18 07:35:04
Its not the addresses. The most likely form of typo is to get the **amount** wrong. A few months ago someone sent me BTC and accidentally "forgot" the decimal point (I gave him the money back).
There exist websites and applications that make it too easy to get the decimal wrong, for example many programmers (probably living in isolation in some far away country) do not know that in most of the world the decimal separator is the comma "," and **not** the period "." so they forget to check and apply the localization settings and parse it with "C" locale, ignore any resulting parse errors or silently attempt to "fix" it without asking the user for confirmation!
I have seen websites that ignore the locale setting and if you enter 0,42 for the amount it will silently remove the comma and change the number to 42 when you click "send". It might also happen the other way around, you enter 0.42 because you are a programmmer yourself and used to the "." notation but for whatever reason you are now sitting in front of a computer that is configured for a different locale and the application you are using just ignores the "." completely instead of at least generating an error message.
**Programmers:** **PLEASE** test your apps with american **and** european locale settings, **always** prefer the configured locale of the user (don't hardcode it to C) because local conventions is what any ordinary unsuspecting user will expect by default, don't accept 1000s separators at all (they are the root of all evil). Check the input for sanity but **don't** silently try to fix it, **don't** do simple string-replace to remove the comma, test your code, test it and then test it again before you release your app to unsuspecting users!

I have a different problem and it as been going on for months already: Sometimes it will stop (or not start) synchronizing and instead use 100% CPU. It is connected to a few peers and also producing some constant minor internet traffic but won't receive any new blocks. It can stay in this state for many hours totally draining the battery. When I leave it plugged in and leave it alone for the night it will eventually recover from this condition after a few hours and the next morning I will usually find the block headers up-to-date and CPU being idle again.
If It hangs this way and I attempt to exit the app (with the back button) it will not end the process, it will keep using all my CPU, I have to kill it with a task manager. Also while this hung process is running starting the UI again (after previously having it left with back button) it will then often just freeze and and be force-killed but still not terminate the busy 100% process. 
I have already developed the habit of using the task manager to look for a 100% CPU process **every** time after using the wallet just in case its acting strange again (especially when I'm not at home to be able to plug it into the charger).

Quite the opposite, Linux PCs are ideal for computer-illiterate people. They are used with mouse and keyboard just exactly like Windows and everything behaves as intuitively expected so there is almost zero additional learning curve, and they avoid all of Windows' disadvantages. They are easier to use, more logical, less confusing and a Linux PC and its security is **much more robust** even in the complete absence of any common sense in its user.

I would do it the same with *any* wallet. The philosophy behind it is simply to never use the same private key in multple loctions at the same time, so once you have moved a key from wallet A to wallet B you should entirely remove it from wallet A. For a paper wallet this means once you made sure that the key works corretly in wallet B and you can access the funds then destroy A. The forums are full with postings from people who experience strange things when they continue using keys in their wallet that they have imported into other wallets because they couldn't remove them properly or are using wallet software that makes this difficult.
You should generally not needlessly move keys around between wallets at all when you don't have 100% full control and knowledge at any moment of what exactly you are doing, the only exeption is a paper wallet and even then you should make matters not more complicated than they absolutely need to be, **so don't ever reuse the same paper wallet more often than exactly once, only import them, then destroy the paper**, don't mess with the keys in your wallet, only import, never export or transplant keys, otherwise chances increase that you mess up something. Paper wallets are cheap, you can generate new ones easily and move funds with a normal transaction.

lol, you can shout as loud as you want, its still a web wallet, no amount of insults you can ever come up with can change the simple fact that you are trusting your keys to some funny random untrustworthy piece of proprietary javascript that is entirely controlled by THEM (not by you) and freshly reloaded from their untrustworthy servers every time you type your password into this website.

look at bitfinex. The liquidity is provided not by the exchange but by other traders/investors who lend some of their BTC or USD for (obscenely high) daily interest rates (but also the risk of loss if bitfinex fails to close losing margin positions fast enough in a fast moving market), so the exchange itself does not expose itself to any risk. Seems to work so far. 
I have lent out $200 for daily 0.7% (!) interest just for the fun of it but I probably would not invest larger amounts. They would pass on every fucked up margin call (haven't seen it happening yet but who knows) directly to the lenders.

The d-wave device is an adiabatic quantum computer and not a gate model quantum computer. 
Gate model computers (once someone succeeds in building one) are supposed to run algorithms like Shor or Grover (and probably many more algorithms that will be invented).
The d-wave device is designed to solve optimization problems that can be expressed as an Ising problem and thats all they can do. They cannot run algorithms, actually they can not "run" anything ("running" in the sense of how a gate model computer is supposed to step through a program in multiple discrete steps, much like a conventional computer), the adiabatic computer does not run a program at all, it is loaded with the coefficients of the Ising model and then in **one slow process** while you are slowly beginning to apply the constraints (the coefficients of your Ising problem) while always keeping it near absolute zero temperaure it finds the optimal solution, all the qbits magically drop out of superposition and find their correct combination that minimize the total energy (and thereby solve the initial problem (finding the absolute minimum on a hyper plane)).
Its very much like for example crystallizing magically lets molecules drop into the correct places to minimize the energy, such a thing is only useful for very specialized classes of problems but I believe this approach where you supply the problem as a set of constraints and the only proper solution "crystallizes" out in one slow step while you slowly apply the constraints (the problem) is the future of quantum computing because its so radically different from the old fashioned classical notion of having to run a program of instructions step by step to calculate a result.
Maybe one day if one could (would) build a piece of hardware that works according to the same principles like the d-wave device but the connections between its qbits are laid out in such a way that the state of least energy would always be the solution to a hash function then maybe such a device would be what I imagine how a quantum ASIC would look like: A piece of hardware specifically designed and hard wired to do only one thing: find the (any) combination of input bits that would hash to a given output by finding a state in which all constraints are satisfied and therefore the total energy minimized. This would be an adiabatic quantum ASIC bitcoin miner. This would also be the end of SHA256.

it will happen when there are enough people having wallets and bitcoins. 
Until then there is nothing wrong with buy and hold, because that makes other people want to buy it too until the critical mass is reached and people can finally transact with most others because enough people will then have a wallet.
So stage 1 will be driven by greed (price increase, profitable investment) and stage 2 (usage as cash) will then automatically ignite once the critical mass has been reached.

MultiBit has wallet-encryption with password, it can manage multiple wallet files, it runs even on really old computers and does not need to dwnload the entire blockchain, its usable *immediately* after istallation. It has the same engine (bitcoinj) as the Android-Wallet (from Schildbach, which also runs even on the oldest Android Phones) and key-backup files from the Android Wallet can be directly imported into a MultiBit Wallet and vice versa. And it can connect direcly to other full nodes, it does *not* need any separate infrastructure or external services like Electrum whch is a *huge* plus in my book. This is currently the  recommendation (if you ask me) if you cannot run a full bitcoin-qt or Armory node and I would recommed it even to abolute beginners.

It can only happen in at least 2 stages, there is no way around this:
1. Initial distribution, bring the number of people with wallets in the population from 0% to 10% so that the network effect for stage 2 can begin to kick in
2. Usage as currency, there is a reasonable chance to know enough other people who have a wallet too so you can begin transacting and settling debts with some other people in bitcoins.
We are still in stage 1. It is totally appropriate to market it a an investment today (because it actually **is** an investment) until we reach critical mass for ignition of stage 2 (will ignite automatically), for quite some time stage 1 will continue to burn even after stage 2 has ignited, leading to a second wave of explosive growth and revolutionary changes, this time will then later be recorded in the history books as the "demise of the dark empire" and the "beginning of modern times".

We have reached critical mass already, it has been growing at a steady rate for 4 years already and is still growing further rapidly despite all attempted smear campaigns and despite extremely hostile regulatory environment. That's why I believe it cannot be stopped anymore.

its calculated automatically, its using the official algorithm that derives it from the transation size in kbytes, for most (almost all) transactions (which are typically &lt;1kbyte) it will use 0.0001 BTC and if it is larger it will use additional 0.0001 BTC for every additional kbyte.
The transaction size depends on the number of inputs it must combine, most of the time this will only be one or two inputs, only if you have received a lot of dust transactions and must combine a lot of them to pay a larger sum it will need a lot of inputs and then it will automatically charge more fees (but not more than necessary).
EDIT: today it is 5 Months later than the original question. 5 Months ago it was indeed configurable and the default fee was a bit high and could be reduced to 0.0001 for most cases. Meanwhile the automatic fee algorithm was implemented and you don't need to think about fees anymore unless you have to deal with hundreds of dust transactions which you should not spend today anyways and instead wait a few more years until bitcoin has gained in value by a few more orders of magnitude and the dust is no dust anymore.

if the transaction is on the blockchain then you have paid and they have received the money. **Nobody** ever needs to care about the sending address, its meaningless. All that is important is the receiving address they gave to you, they just have to look up whether that address has received the payments and then they know you have paid. 
For this to work easily (for them) they should generate a new receiving address for each customer and each payment. If they only have one address for all incoming payments its totally their **own problem** how to tell all the incoming payments apart, not your problem! And sending address is not and has never been used to do things like this. Nobody knows¹ his sending address(es).
¹ of course you can look up the transaction details (like you did) and then see from which (possibly multiple) addresses the money was drawn but normally this is totally irrelevant, all that matters is the "to" address. If you have sent them the link to the transaction details then thats all they need to know to find the money.

Why is the "send" button "connected" to the "last sent" with the same kind of line that connects it to "balance", whats the siginificance of this symmetry, what makes "last sent" and "balance" symmetrical about the "send" button? The same question for the symmetry between "trade" (what is that in the context of a wallet anyways?) and "receive", why are they symmetrical? Are they opposite operations?
I have looked at it and spend several minutes only for trying to decipher any **logical** reason or meaning in the way how the visual elements are placed or grouped, their connections among each oher or how their different sizes and shapes are related to their functional relationship between each other and I could not find any. It seems they all have random shapes, random positions, random lines between each other and it only serves the purpose of making it look futuristic, not actually trying to put them into some logical relation to each other. This interface is extremely chaotic and confusing!
And also: action bar icons belong to the top, not the bottom, just remove the huge "Electrum" from the action bar, a small icon on the left is enough and you have enough room for the action buttons where they belong"
Pro: the receive icon (circle with arrow) is an intuitive design to visualize the concept of "receive", much better than the receive icon of the schildbach wallet.

Congratulations for your first wallet.
The first thing you should do now is to use the wallet backup function to create a password protected wallet backup file and store that backup file somewhere else (just in case your phone breaks unexpectedly or gets stolen).
The safety warnings are there to make you aware that you are dealing with real money here. You can turn them off once you are aware of this and understand all the implications.
The wallet file is shielded from other apps by file system permissions, the only app that can ever access it is the wallet app itself as long as you do not grant root permissions to other dubious apps, so either don't root your phone at all or if you absolutely needed to root it then be very careful what other apps you allow to use the root permissions.
Don't load the mobile wallet with more bitcoins than you intend to spend (don't walk around wth thousands of dollars of cash in your pocket all day long, bitoin is like cash, store the majority of bitcoins in a safe place at home [and always keep backup files in different locations]).

The change will *ALWAYS* go to one of your own addresses in the wallet you are using. Just don't rely on which address exactly it goes as this is not of any importance for normal usage anyways.
Import the paper key and then destroy the paper (because now it has become a part of your wallet). Import the key and then immediately send everything you don't intend to spend to a *NEW* paper. Then burn the old paper. If you do it that way you can't accidentally mess up someting and also don't need to care about the internal workings and individual keys and change addresses.

Just import the key into your wallet and then immediatly send everything you don't need to a new empty paper wallet, then burn the old paper.
Example: 
Paper wallet has 50 BTC and your bitcoin-qt has 1.42 BTC. Now you you need half of the paper wallet to buy something expensive. Import the paper wallet into bitcoin-qt (from this moment on its no longer a paper wallet, its now a part of the bitcon-qt wallet, your bitcoin-qt has now 51.42 BTC) send the 25 BTC you wont need to a *NEW* paper wallet, burn the old paper, you now have 26.42 BTC in bitcoin-qt. No need to worry about the change or anything, just follow the above procedure and everything will be fine.

Its actually just scatter plots of the raw data. I had a list of daily prices (one number per day, denominated in USD) and another list containing the price range of each day (high-low, also one number for each day, also denominated in USD).
Then I made a scatter plot. Without any attempt to transform or smooth the data in any way I just plotted the raw data exactly as it was. Each point in this plot represents one day, x coordinate of each point is the open price of that day, y coordinate is the price range of that day (high -low). The scatter plot suggests that there is some kind of relationship between absolute price and daily range because a straight diagonal line (with a slope of 1) in a log-log plot is a linear relationship: y = ax with no offset (actually its y=ax^k with k=1).
One could argue about the exact value of a here (it would change when shifting the line up or down and there **is** a large error here in determining its exact value) but thats not the point here, the point is that its hard to look at this chart and not acknowledge the very obvious fact that there is indeed a linear relationship between absolute price and the height of the daily range.
After the first plot indicated it might make sense to calculate a ratio daily_range/daily_price I did this for each day individually and plotted the results into the second chart and from eyeballing it it looks like this ratio stays in some kind of constant range or at least it did not become larger than during the early days and although the slope of the regression line I plotted in the second chart probably has a huge error and might just as well be horizontal or even slightly rising it serves to illustrates what I think these plots suggest: There is no sudden explosion in volatility, it has always been that way, it almost seems as if it had been even worse in earlier days.
That's all these plots are meant to be. Its just a different way to look at the raw data. The same old boring data not plotted into the same old well known price charts but instead visualized in a slightly different way. No more and no less. And no complicated math involved. Just 2 scatter plots of raw unfiltered data.

The tip bot manages this wallet address on your behalf (this is possible because unlike traditional banking where humans need to be involved to open a bank account, here a simple computer program can open accounts and do financial transactions completely autonomously). 
You control the tip bot by sending messages to it containing simple commands (these commands are listed on the help page) and the bot will immediately execute these commands. So you can for example command it to tell you the deposit address where to send bitcoins to in order to fund it or you send it a command that instructs it to send all its funds (or a certain amount) to a certain bitcoin address (this could be for example be the address of your desktop wallet or any other address).
The commands are listed here:
scroll down to the section "Personal Message Command Links"
PS: Unfortunately the bitcointip help page is utterly unstructured, confusing and outright chaotic but after reading it completely and asking questions to other users you will soon find out how to use the needed commands to control the bot.

Is there any way to find out how much to expect for any given amount of "computing power"? Maybe a table with approximate earnings for certain types of CPU, number of cores, MHz or whatever is most relevant), just a rough guide to estimate at least the order of magnitude we are talking about? 
With cryptocurrency mining I could easily estimate my expected hash rate without even trying it by simply comparing my available CPU/GPU with the ones of other people and their achieved numbers, and then roughly estimate my potential earnings, is there a comparable metric for this service that I can determine beforehand or at least estimate before I sign up and start working?
Its a scam. I have looked into their forums, I have really searched thoroughly for quite some time now in their forum to see what users are posting about the software, their hardware and their stats and found **not the slightest hint** that the software does **anything** with the idle CPU power at all, they actually even don't know themselves (or more likely don't want to answer) what "idle" actually means for their software and the idle cycles just stay idle and it does nothing! What I have found however are plenty of hints about **purchasing** some kind of premium accounts for **$150** and loads of multi-level marketing bullshit, all the stats about "earnings" that users post are statistics about their multi-level referral commissions they are awarded for tricking other victims into buying premium accounts. **Its a fraudulent Pyramid scheme!**
**EDIT 2:**
Another hint is they are threatening to cancel user accounts if you install it twice on the same computer in a virtual machine. This is ridiculous! It means that whatever the software does is clearly **not CPU-bound**, otherwise they would not care how many instances you have running concurrently, its more likely that it is bound by number of individual users, most likely this software does not need your CPU at all, it needs your IP-Address! That also explains why there is a version for mobile phones which would be ridiculous for any sort of number crunching job! There is no other rational explanation for such strange requirements! **They are probably using your IP to run a SPAM-bot from a unique IP or even worse!**
**EDIT 3:**
Don't even try to install it: **They are aware of the existence of Bitcoin** and the high likelihood of Bitcoin users being interested in anything that has to do with trading CPU for money. This means **it might very well be possible that their untrusted closed source software could attempt to steal your coins!**

This is how it works on an exchange, there it will be put onto the orderbook as a bid if it is lower than current lowest ask.
If coinbase is providing someting lilke this nowadays too (do they?) then it is still not a real orderbook, you cannot make others (or coinbase) sell to you at your bid, they can only implement something that makes you buy at their ask automatically should the price ever happen to move so low that their ask meets your desired buy price.

And centuries later it had value because it had value (recursive). And still no gold plated contacts or microchips or cell phones.

there is actually a way to use Tor without using *ANY* exit node. Its called hidden-service (or more commonly known as .onion addresses, SilkRoad users will have seen this already) that allows a p2p connecton between 2 clients (yes, they can be both clients, none of them has to advertise itself as a relay node, even the silkroad server might be just an ordinary Tor client running on a linux laptop on the kitchen table in some apartment behind a NAT router).
One way to set up a secure chat network would be to run a chat server (XMPP or IRC or anything else) as such an .onion server, another one would be completely decentralized p2p approach as it is for example implemented in TorChat where peers directly connect to other peers addressing each other by their .onion addresses (and the .onion address being the chat ID on the buddy list). Such traffic would never leave the Tor network, the tunnel between 2 peers (through which the tcp connection is transported) would reach through from one client to the other client (acrross 6 hops).

All these problems are because it is so incredibly difficult to reliably move FIAT currency from A to B.
The good news is this is the reason why bitcoin will succeed while fiat will die. Money that is not transportable anymore will lose its status as money. Transportability is a necessary property of money and if the banks remove that property from fiat then fiat will no longer be money.

If you are using the password protection of the wallet in MultiBit with a good password you would not even need the encrypted USB key but of course it won't hurt.
As always the main attack vector if I wanted to steal your coins would be to somehow bring your PC under my control. With Windows this is especially easy. I would try to make you unknowingly install a keylogger to find your wallet password (and maybe also the password of the USB key, but maybe thats not even needed because while you are using it its unlocked anyways) and then extract your keys from the wallet file and do a transaction and this could happen in less than a second.
Probably the best thing would be to separate bitcoin usage completely from all other computer usage, use a separate computer. You don't need to implement the extreme paranoid always-offline setup that is described often, its enough if you just install Linux (not Windows!) on a separate computer (may be online, this is not a problem) and use that **only** for bitcoin, that should be 99.99999% secure.

I would say the absolute volatility has no meaning in financial instruments. its always the relative volatility that counts. 
All price charts of commodities, stocks, currencies you will ever see are always heteroskedastic, their variance will scale with the mean. This is because the underlying model for most of these financial quantities is multiplicative and **not additive**, this is also the reason why you should **always** plot prices and exchange rates on a log chart. A linear chart is misleading and meaningless when the data you are looking at is not linear and this effect will become even more severe and outright dangerous when the price is trending as it is the case with bitcoin.

It might very well turn out that a "sweet spot" cannot exist and debt-backed fiat cannot peacefully coexist with cryptocurrency in a stable equilibrium. Then (if it really succeeds) we simply would stop measuring its value in fiat at one future point in time because it wouldn't make any sense anymore when this value asymptotically approaches infinity.
Keep this possibility in mind when thinking about future scenarios, after all the replacement of current fiat banking is the stated ultimate goal of cryptocurrency, so we are indeed aiming for no less than $infinity!

can you give a simple example of how the money flows between the involved parties for example in the event the difficulty is rising faster than predicted? I still don't get who is ultimately going to pay for the losses that a miner would have without such a contract, where does the money ultimately come from?
[Edit:] Say for example there is a contract that expires in 6 months and predicts difficulty pretty reasonably but then suddenly a revolutionary new kind of mining technology becomes available and the difficulty jumps by a factor of 100 (relative to what was expected). All ASICs become worthless and these contracts jump in value 100-fold. **WHO** is now paying all that money after the 6 months are over and the contract expires? I guess its the one who issued these contracts but what if this person decides to simply disappear or is bankrupt?

No, you would be buying low and selling high. You would make profit as long as price keeps bouning between your 2 walls, only if pressure in one directon becomes too much and you must sell more than you buy (or the other way around) then you come into trouble.
There exist liquidity bots that actually do this, they create bid and ask orders to absorb market orders, they just do it more intelligently and move their orders when price wants to move in one direction instead of trying to stay at one price and fight the market. These bots can make a lot of profit and at the same time they serve the market by providing liquidity and removing volatlity.

Whether the algorithm works in the first place was the most important question at all (for me at least because I didn't believe it until 30 minutes ago when I saw the results of the simulations)! How people then might behave in the presence of such a thing (if it works) is another topic.

Once you have imported the old keys from the backup into the new wallet the wallet will have these old addresses too (on top of the ones it had before). A wallet is always a **collection** of keys (and their addresses) and you would just add the old backuped keys (and with it their addresses) to the new wallet app so that it now has **all** the keys and addresses (and their bitcoins) in that wallet.
So in short: You import the keys from the backup and all your old addresses and the bitcoins are accessible again.
Pro-tip: You can import the Android-Wallet backup file directly into the MultiBit desktop wallet application without any complicated conversion (and vice versa), because they are both based on the same codebase (the Java implementation bitcoinj from Mike Hearn). So if your phone is stolen you can act quickly on your desktop without first buying a new phone, you import the android backup into a new empty multibit wallet and then immediately send all coins to a safe location before the thief has figured out what bitcoin is, so you have essentially pulled away the bitcoins from the phone remotely without the thief knowing whats going on (if you act quickly).

I have such an old Laptop myself, its a ThinkPad T40 with Intel Pentium-M, 1.3GHz. It would not boot Ubuntu Precise (12.04 LTS) Live-CD.
But Ubuntu 12.04 still has the old non-PAE-kernels in its repositories, so theoretically (and practically) it will be able to run on this machine, its just not included in the Install-CD anymore.
You could try the following: Install any older *buntu prior to 12.04 (and I would use Xubuntu because it does not have that stupid Unity desktop and needs much less RAM) and then after successful installation immediately do the online upgrade to 12.04 LTS. This way it will use the non-PAE-kernels, you will have circumvented the restriction on the install CD and still have a current 12.04 LTS which will be supported for many more years to come. This is what I currently have on my old ThinkPad too and I'm absolutely happy with it.

There are a few more nuances between the two extremes 
* (a) manage large sums on a virus infested Windows-PC

How about for example one of these:
* use a normal Linux Laptop for Bitcoin (connected to Internet)
* use an old android phone that is not used anymore for anything else
of course none of these will bring the fort-knox security of method (b) mentioned above but why do many people always insist that (b) is the only alternative to (a) while the suggestions mentioned by me will easily boost the security from 0 to 99.999% of method b without demanding any of its complicated inconveniences from the average user?

You could export the keys (unencrypted), then edit the file with a text editor, remove the offending key and import it again into a new empty wallet. The difficulty here is it shows only the private keys, not the corresponding addresses, so it might be a bit tricky to identify which key it actually is that belongs to the address. 
Also when creating a new empty wallet to import the keys there will be at least already one new key in the wallet, so you will not be able to have a wallet with **only** the keys from the backup file, it will always be the keys from the backup file plus the one default key from the newly generated wallet that was already in it.
Don't forget to delete the unencrypted files if you are done and then wipe all free space on the disk, or even better, wipe the disk entirely, then format and reinstall.

1. Of course they have an order book, otherwise there would not be such a thing as orders. You are probably confusing this with a "depth chart" which is the visual representation of the book, you should put this into the category of charting capabilities of their website. Without a book they could not store and process orders. I suggest changing this to "provides depth chart". If you write "does not **have** orderbook" thats just confusing and plain wrong. You can see the gox oderbook at clarkmoody and bitcoinwisdom or in goxtool/goxgui or any other trading software that connects to gox, so obviously they have one.

On **rare** occasions MultiBit fails to sync, this is not dangerous, it just fails to see the incoming transaction when this happens.
There is the option in MultiBit to reset the blockchain, this can safely be used, it will just re-request all relevant transactions and block headers from the network from a given date onwards and recalculate your balance.
This might or might not be the reason for the symptoms you are observing, but it won't hurt to give it a try.

You can safely omit the "has never been on a network" part and all the complications and additional steps this implicates if you just use Linux. 
Here is what I recommend:
* Use one of your old PCs or laptops that you would otherwise have thrown away or get one for $50 on ebay or elsewhere.
* Install Xubuntu, then install Multibit or Electrum
* You can safely keep this machine connected to your LAN or WIFI to be able to run automatic updates and to do Bitcoin transactions, just don't use it for anything other than its intended purpose, use this computer only for Bitcoin and nothing else, don't install any other software on it.
* use the functions provided by your wallet software to create password protected backups and store them in secure places
The "never been on a network" thing is total overkill when using Linux instead of Windows. Especially when you do no web browsing, no email, no gaming and nothing else on this machine except running your Bitcoin wallet.

There is a way. Just run the Tor proxy on a separate machine that has two interfaces:
* eth0 connected to (or has a route to) the internet
* eth1 connected to a private network (RFC 1918) with your webservers.
do not enable ip forwarding. Do not configure any route from one network into the other (your private network is totally isolated). Do not run any other services on the Tor proxy machine (all ports closed), you can even close the Tor socks port if the webservers do not need to make outbound connections.
Then configure the hidden services on the Tor proxy and point them to the webservers in your private network. To avoid the recently published attack against hidden services where the attacker is trying to become your entry guard you should make sure you configure a number of fixed trusted entry guards, you could for example run your own entry nodes (hosted elsewhere) or use Tor nodes of trusted friends or organizations as entry. Don't enable middleman or exit on your Tor proxy, let it run as a simple client.
Now if someone manages to exploit and root one of the webservers in your private network, he won't be able to break out of this network and reach the internet, no matter how hard he tries, he won't be able to see what is on the other side of the Tor proxy because Tor won't tell him anything. And if the socks port is closed he even won't be able to reach Tor at all.

The world is full of extremely mature and stable software that has had version numbers below 1 since decades and also with software that has double digit version numbers that gets worse with every new release.
A version number is just a number. Its only purpose is to be larger than the number of the previous version and smaller than the number of the next version. There is no requirement for the number to be greater than 1 or greater than pi or greater than any other arbitrary number, all it has to be is greater than the previous version number of the same software.

There could be malware on your computer, specifically designed to steal passwords. They install themselves silently (through vulnerabilities in other applications) or they come as secret part of other applications you have willingly installed without knowing about their secret evil additional functions (trojan horse). Its very difficult, **often impossible** to detect them before they do any harm. 
The only way to avoid it is to minimize the attack surface as much as possible.

You should detrend it first, use the first derivative of the price.
Also what I have found interesting (back in the days when I messed around with EUR/USD, didn't try to do it with Bitcoin yet) is to do an autocorrelation analysis (for examle acf() and friends in R, also try this with detrended data), I even made a "profitable" trading bot for EUR/USD based on this but it stopped working the very day I gave it real money to trade and my beautiful autocorrelation that has been stable for years immediately vanished into nothingness and never came back.

Coinbase is extremely unsafe because its located inside the USA and they could declare it illegal any moment (they could just interpret the laws regarding all the needed legal paperwork slightly different and find some minor violation or missing requirement) and shut down the company and seize everything.
You should install a software wallet like Electrum and store your BTC at home. Electrum will force you to write down the seed on a piece of paper and verifies that its correct, so you cannot accidentally lose your BTC through laziness, failed hardware or similar accidents.

Yes, this would also be very nice. If the client side can be kept very simple (unlike for example the MtGox streaming api where the client has to do massive amounts of heavy lifting to keep its internal state in sync with the exchange and compensate for all the glitches and missing data and sporadic disconnects and nonsensical error messages and lost messages), if it provides a simple and straightforward API that just works[TM] and just does what one expects from it and works exactly the same for all exchanges and can be used via a TCP connection then this would be great!
wish list:
* always keeps track of full orderbook, and other important state, updates everything in real time, does the heavy lifting and working with the ugly exchange API, reconnects if disconnected, etc.
* allows to send orders
* keeps track of own orders and account status in realtime
* client can poll the state of all the above on demand
* client can subscribe for all kinds of events when the state changes

Why do you have to sell? Are you trading on leverage? Or did you buy it because you expected it to be a get rich quick scheme? Did you buy more than you can afford to stay locked for a long time or even be totally lost?
@_date: 2013-11-13 18:19:48
an exchange is a place where traders can place their limit orders (bids and asks), they are maintained in the so called order book which is a sorted list of bids and asks, ordered by price, and then other traders can come and take them (they take the lowest ask or the highest bid). This is effectively an auction and its the mechanism how a market price is established.
A dealer is just one person (or company) who will quote just one price for sell and one price for buy and you can either take it or not. You cannot place your own orders, there is no order book.
On an exchange every trader can either be liquidity provider or liquidity taker or even both at the same time, there are many traders competing for the lowest ask and the highest bid and establishing the market price. At a place like coinbase you can only be the taker, never the provider, you have to accept their price if you want to buy, you cannot just put yourself in front of them with a slightly higher bid and wait for the next one to sell like you could do it on an exchange.

MT has explained this a few times in the IRC channel, don't have direct link at the moment but you can do a little experiment to see it yourself:
Place a buy order with an amount you can easily spot and identify with a simple text search, like for example buy 666.6661666 BTC at 0.01 USD. Then (after waiting a few minutes) download the fulldepth for all (or a few) other markets and find this very same bid there in all these orderbooks too. Then cancel the bid, then again download fulldepth and see its gone again. Fulldepth is heavily cached, so you might want to wait 10 minutes until it shows up.
Note the price difference in the other markets, it will be a few % below what the official forex rate would dictate and asks would be a few % higher than what the official forex rate would say. These few percent cover the costs of MtGox to convert the different fiats into each other should the order get filled in a different currency than where it was placed.
BTW: the really clever thing is they actually need their bank to convert only the **difference** of what remains at the end of the day (or week) but they can keep the 3% conversion rate for every such cross-currency-trade, even if they cancel out each other completely at the end of the week.

* this can be connected to your home W(LAN), the "never been on the network" thing would be ok if some circumstances forced you to use Windows (in the Windows world there is no other way to make it secure than disconnecting from the network entirely, this is the only tool they have) but you are not using Windows so you don't need to follow the windows way of doing things.

one cannot simply peg bitoin to dollars. If you try then eventually you will run out of coins or out of dollars because you cannot produce more coins out of nothing when you need them and you also cannot just produce more dollars if you are not a central bank. 
The price will be determined by the market. If you try to keep price low and then run out of coin you cant sell cheap coins anymore and price will go up. If you try to keep price up by buying coins at artifiially high prices and then eventually run out of dollars then you cant buy anymore and price will fall. The market will win.

Armory is too heavyweight for a new user and if they don't have the very latest hardware with SSD and 100MBit broadband they will be busy downloading the blockchain until January before they can use the coins. Use something lightweight, for example MultiBit. 
Your your paper wallets could also be electrum seeds of preloaded electrum wallets and then give them instructions of how to install Electrum and restore from seed (this is currently my favorite for new users if you ask me).
The only consumer (== ordinary user) app that I am aware of that currently exists that can deal with paper wallets (like the ones from bitaddress.org) at all is Mycelium for Android (and maybe blockchain.info but I would not recommend blockchain.info because it runs in the browser and the web browser is usually the most insecure and most often attacked piece of software on every computer).

Not recommended in its current form.
* A separate Linux laptop for secure storage of large amounts, can also be used to produce paper wallets. I recommend Xubuntu Linux (easy for windows users) and the MultiBit Wallet.
* An alternative for cold storage of large sums would be a separate (old) Android Phone with Wallet (Schildbach) that is not used for anything else (factory-reset it first) and always kept in a safe location at home, never carried around. This is probably even more secure than the Xubuntu Laptop.

The backup contains the private keys. Each bitcoin address you generate has its own private key, so if you generate new receive addresses then you need to make a new backup. If you restore the backup (and it has all keys) then all money is accessible again (it just needs the keys, the transactions are pulled from the block chain). After installation it has only one address and only one key, if you use it only for pocket change you need only one address.
If you grant root to a dubious app and its programmer is evil and designed the app to look for wallet files and steal them then your money will be stolen. 
The wallet file is in the folder /data/data/de.schildbach.wallet/files/ and it is unencrypted for convenience but its protected by the linux file system permissions in such a way that only the app itself can access it. You will note that if you try to browse to this folder with a file explorer it will not allow you to access this folder unless you grant root to the file explorer.
Storing the coins at home could be something like a paper wallet or an encrypted wallet on a Linux PC or a brain wallet with a long pass phrase, a dedicated hardware wallet or something like this, a lot of articles have been written about how to store larger amounts of money in a secure way, they vary in a wide range from reasonably secure to extremely paranoid. If you have such a secure storage (for example a paper wallet) than this has its own bitcoin address and you transfer money by making a normal bitcoin transaction. If you later need some money from the paper wallet then you import its key, then immediately send all money (minus the amount you want to spend) to a **new** paper wallet and then burn the old paper wallet.

yes, thats the convention. Just look at other forex pairs: "EUR/USD", "USD/JPY", etc. They all have the base currency first and the quote currency second. Its just a convention, don't try to interpret a mathematical meaning into the "/", its just a slash, its just a naming convention for the pair names.
If you reallly insist on finding a mathematical meaning then you could look at it this way: BTC/USD is the price of 1 BTC (in whatever) divided by the price of 1 USD (in whatever) and "whatever" can be anything (Gold, Dollar, Euro, Tulips) because it will be canceled out in the division.
So for example:
    1 BTC = 1468 tulips
    1 USD = 2 tulips
    BTC/USD = 1468 tulips / 2 tulips = 734/1 = 734
As you can see the "tulip" is canceled in the division. We could have just as well expressed both prices in gold or USD or in whatever else, it would have been canceled out in the division and we are left with the **dimensionless** number 734 as the **ratio** of the **price of BTC divided by the price of USD**.

No.  A Model that shows that the selfish **mining algorithm** wins more blocks than honest mining (because that is totally counterintuitive in itself in the first place [but from watching the simulation it seems to work indeed]) to check that the math is correct (or to demonstrate how it works even if the math is too complicated to be easily understood by non-mathematicians).
The very same way one can either simulate or formally prove the behavior of  for example a martingale betting strategy or something like that. Some people will easily understand the formal proof and others will believe it when they see it actually **happening** before their eyes. Sometimes 5 lines of imperative code are faster to verify than staring at 5 lines of math without being entirely sure **why** it actually works that way even if it says it does, especially if it strongly contradicts all intuition.

I haven't used blockchain.info for a long time. As far as i know you can import the private key into your wallet and then it becomes a regular part of the wallet (with the ability to spend if you imported the privkey, not as a watch-only). As soon as you can spend from it (and change goes to one of your other addresses in the wallet) the paper is no longer of any use, the key has become part of the wallet. You can then send what is left over after spending to a **new** paper wallet if you want or just leave it all in the online wallet.

I still don't know whether I should implement the same for multiple exchanges, it was a **lot** of work, most of the work was done during the ddos and times when all shortcomings of their API and misbehaving server became obvious and I needed to work around it. But it was worth every second because now I always have the complete state of my account and the orderbook in memory and updated in realtime and my strategy modules (I can load multiple strategy modules at the same time) can then just connect their slots to a whole bunch of different signals (all internal parts of goxtool/goxapi communicate through a simple synchronous signal/slot mechanism), react to events and can access the state of the orderbook, the history, the account as they need.
If such a thing (equally powerful and reliable) were available for multiple exchanges as a daemon accessible via TCP or some other simple portable method with a simple API so that I can easly make nice GUI or connect a few bots (all at the same time) even if they are written in different languages then I would not need to port goxapi.py to bitstamp, I would just throw away goxapi.py altogether and connect my ncurses API with a thin wrapper and my strategy loader directly to your exchange api daemon and then have **all** exchanges at my disposal.

No. Its much simpler: Just keep the important stuff (your money) separate from everything else you do. For example get a cheap old android phone, factory reset it, install a wallet app and nothing else. No stupid bitcoin widgets, no root, no silly games, just the wallet and nothing else. Lock it away from your children. Dont need a PHD for that.

$10 spikes in either direction in the XAU market is actually a pretty common thing, I have seen much more impressive jumps on a regular basis, when you watch the charts every day you will get used to it and not spend a single millisecond wondering about a measly $10 move in this market anymore. 
The author of this article obviously has seen a XAU chart (or any chart in any market) for the first time in his life today as it seems.

It must be seen as an investment until enough people have wallets, once that is reached the network effect of being able to *use* them will kick in and *usage* will begin to explode. Until then the adoption is only driven by the promise of value increase. There is no way around this, usage as a medium of exchange will automatically take over and be the main driver after most people have wallets and prices don't move so fast anymore.

look for the rolling backup in the multibit data folder, maybe there is a backup left from the time before you encrypted the wallet
@_date: 2013-11-21 14:30:13
If they have access to the computer they need the password you choose to protect the wallet.
The 12 words are to reconstruct the wallet on a new computer should the old one go up in smoke, its a clever backup mechanism. If you have lost the password or the computer failed you can use the 12 words to reconstruct your wallet.
BUT this only works if you don't manually import foreign private keys (for example from Multibit) into the Electrum wallet, the 12 words wallet recovery only work for the auto-generated addresses, always keep this in mind! I recommend not importing additional keys into electrum, rather use a regular bitcoin transaction to move the funds to the new wallet.

Because when dealing in in BTC no country can enforce its regulations onto your business, as soon as you move your operations outside of their territory you are free. 
This is not possible when you need to deal with USD, then you always need the permission of the USA, no matter where on this planet you are hiding, because they indirectly control all banks in this world and have implemented the "Remote Screwing Protocol over Hierarchical Banking Extortion" (RSPoHBE).

Unfortunately there is no way to extract it without rooting the phone.
The way I'm doing it currently is when adding a new key to the authenticator I also write down the key on paper and keep it separately in a safe place. 
To verify I have no typo in my copy is to immedately try to enter the key manually into the authenticator and verify it generates the exact same codes as the key I just scanned. This takes 2 minutes more time to setup but after that procedure I am sure i cannot lose the key anymore.
Other people take screenshots of the qr code and keep it in a safe place or copy/paste the key into something like keepass, that works too and is a little bit faster.

* underlying model for price and price ratios is suspected to be multiplicative and not additive (additive would actually be quite surprising because commodity prices and exchange rates never have additive models) -&gt; log scale is appropriate
* distribution of data is skewed, log almost perfectly normalizes it, further strengthening the assumption in 1
* variance of price data scales with the mean (as visible in the first scatter plot), further strengthening the assumption in 1
* the second plot has a linear time axis because an additive model for time seems more appropriate (so far away from big bang and heat death) and also for our purpose here.

The dangerous thing are keyloggers. They patiently wait on your system until you access your wallet and then grab your password and other needed data and send it home to their creator.
You should keep your wallet and do Bitcoin transactions only on a PC of which you can reasonable be sure that it is not infected with such specialized malware. A Virus scanner can **NOT** guarantee this!
There are a couple of operating systems on the market that are more or less secure, Windows is by far the worst of all in terms of seurity, you should strictly avoid it, you should choose **any** other operating system than Windows, this will instantly bring you from 0% to 95% security. Additionally you can do all bitcoin stuff on a separate PC that will only be used for Bitcoin and noting else, this will bring you to 99.99% and the last remaining 0.01% would be to use a computer that never was and never will be connected to the internet (here we are already entering tinfoil hat area, I personally believe this is overkill, I can live with a normal Linux laptop, connected to the internet but not used for web browsing or any other stuff, this is easy to setup and easy to handle)

They are expecting it to move through several **stages**.

the USD I lend can only used for long trades (of course I could also lend BTC for short trades but don't currently do it because I cannot charge so much interest for BTC).
The trader needs $200 in his account (as some kind of collateral) and then can borrow additional $200 and (temporarily) buy BTC for a total of $400 (he cannot walk away with these BTC, they stay at the exchange in an open position). 
Now if BTC price goes up he can eventually close this position (BTC are sold at a higher price), the borrowed $200 are given back to me (with interest) the other $200 (the collateral [also called margin]) is released again to the trader and the profit (minus the interest) is also given to the trader.
If BTC price happens to go down after he opened the long position he will make a loss and at some point will be forced to close the position (sell the BTC) at a loss. Say for example he bought $400 worth of BTC (and has only $200 deposited as margin) the position MUST be closed when the BTC price goes down by 50% (actually it will happen a bit earlier) because then his long position is only worth $200 (and these $200 plus some interest are mine) and the losing trader only has deposited $200, so his account would be $0. He lost everything.
They try to force close the positions ("margin call") a bit earlier, so it never happens that he ends up with a negative balance or I don't get all my $200 (plus interest) back. 
This is essentially how it works. For short positions it works the same, only in that case there are lenders who lend their BTC.

The "agreement" is irrelevant. Since miners have no vote in bitcoin protocol decisions there is no point in making agreements with them.
Its like trying to make agreements and negotiate compromises with the wheels on your car when you want to turn left: It would be nonsense. You just turn left and the wheels will follow because they are attached to the car, they have no choice.
In the same way are the miners attached to bitcoin, they have no choice than to follow its protocol and mine exactly the blocks that the network wants, otherwise they would not get any reward and this would be economic suicide.
Bip 9 was a mistake, it gave them temporary powers that they did not have in the original design of bitcoin, this quickly went to their heads and now they believe they have a say in these matters (and other people even begin to believe it too). But Bip 9 will not be repeated again.

There is no upper price limit, at least not measured in USD because should bitcoin usage ever come close to these numbers and take significant market share away from USD (and other fiat) it would collapse the fiat entirely. 
These houses of cards are already unstable and on the brink of collapse and while they might still be able to withstand the tiny 0.0001% bitcoin market share today they would certainly not survive a seismic event of losing double digit percent market share. They did not account for something like that ever happening when they conceived the debt money fiat scheme long ago, it was not included in their calculations.

MultBit's fee is 0.0005 by default, you can configure it to anything you want, I have set the fee to 0.0001 in my wallet and have no problems with that.
If you want to move the money to another wallet then the easiest is to just send it with a transacton. If you want to keep the addresses (not recommended!) then just export the keys, open the export file with a text editor and manually import each and every key into the bitcoin-qt wallet, rescan the wallet and then make sure the entire balance shows up correctly in qt before you finally delete the MultiBit wallet.

There is nothing special to it. People might be waiting for some kind of flash crash on MtGox like the one that happened in the early beginning and so many people who have a few dollars left on gox put a few of these fun bids (buy 100000 BTC at $0.00001 and similar) and hope for a miracle. Some might be more realistic and hope to buy 100 BTC at 0.01 (which might happen more likely **if** such an accident should ever happen) and some are even more realistic and always keep a bid at $200 or $100. None of them is stuck there, its just people playing some kind of lottery, hoping for a miracle.

DDoS does not cause the price to drop.

After seeing how memory usage exploded in the browser, quickly eating up all RAM and all swap in a matter of seconds and then bringing the entire machine to a grinding halt I didn't even dream of implementing it on something as small as a microcontroller, even if the implementation were a thousand times more memory friendly than the JavaScript on bitaddress.org.

I think there is a small misunderstanding of what the term "wallet" actually means and I think your question has the wrong title, you actually did not ask for a wallet, you asked for an exchange. Its important to understand the difference.
A wallet is not the service where you buy and sell BTC for other currency, a wallet is where you hold your coins after you bought them. You should keep them separate from the exchange and you should always use a wallet that gives you **full control** over your own private keys. If in doubt about a specific wallet service or wallet app then just ask.
Since you are loking for a place  to buy BTC for USD you are actually not looking for a **wallet**, you are looking for an **exchange**, so the question you asked should not be titled "best wallet", it should be "best exchange". Of course many exchanges also provide a wallet service but this is not their core business and main purpose. You should always clearly separete these two so that when you some day want to switch to a different exchange or they go out of business you still keep your wallet.
If you are asking "what is the best wallet" you will get answers like Bitcoin-Qt, MultiBit, Electrum, etc. These are wallets and **only** wallets, they have no exchange to/from USD, they do only one thing: hold and manage your BTC. Thats what a wallet does.
If you instead ask "where can I exchange BTC to/from USD" then you will get answers like CoinBase, LocalBitcoins, MtGox, Bitstamp, etc. Many of them also provide some rudimentary wallet service but you should rather use a dedicated full blown standalone wallet for that and keep these two things "exchange" and "wallet" completely separate. **The exchange (any exchange!) can go out of business any moment and take its built in wallet service and all the BTC with it, your dedicated standalone wallet would not be subject to such dangers!**

Please install a software wallet (Eletcrum, MultiBit) on your computer and don't use *ANYTHING* that runs in your web browser to manage the keys to your money! A web browser is generally the most insecure place on your entire computer to entrust such important information like the private keys of your money, even if it is meant to handle the keys locally and not on their server, its still all happening inside the browser with all its plugins and add-ons and tool-bars and zero-day-vulnerabilities and whatnot, I would not trust it a singe millibit.

More important would be that text input fields in applications and websites would just accept and parse **any** denomination you enter. **Let the user decide on a case by case basis!** Like for example the bitcointip bot already does.
you could write
0.0001 or 0.1m or 100u and it would be interpreted as the exact same number, you would not need to force the user to prefer any particular style, it would totally be up to the user what he prefers for this particular amount. 
For example just look at how it is done when an engineer writes the values of components (resistors, capacitors) into a schematic diagram or when simulating it in spice, he will be faced with the necessity of entering numbers of a huge range of possible values, ranging across many orders of magnitude. There might be a coil with 0.1H and right next to it another one with 0.000001H, in the simulation software he would not enter it that way, he would also not say "Hey, lets change the entire software to millihenry already because all we are doing nowadays is switching power supplies, nobody has these huge transformers anymore", he would just write 100m and 1u, he would even leave out the "Henry" because it is clear that it can only be "H" because it is a coil (but of course the software would not mind if he had written "1uH" instead, it would be smart enough to know that this is the same, however it **would** have flagged an error if he had written" 1uF" because "Farad" would be the wrong unit for this type of component, it would not make sense here.)
Now apply this to bitcoin. Most times you don't need to enter the "BTC" in the text field because currency is restricted to Bitcoin already in this context but the "m" or the "u"  belongs to the number, its not part of the unit, so it should logically be able to be entered by the user as part of the number literal. So I would like to see Bitcoin wallets to parse the **number** "100m" just the same way as it would have parsed "0.1" and of course even allow 100mBTC or 100m฿ (but flag an error if the user entered 100m$ because Dollar do not belong into this particular text field).

The trader can withdraw in small chunks to different receiving addresses and let it sit there or mix it further. The sending addresses of these transactions will be random addresses from a shared pool of the exchange and not personalized, so from the outside the total amount is invisible.

forget the day trading and the "instinct", you cannot beat the market that way. 
You might have a chance maybe only once or twice a year catching a bubble-top and then immediately the subsequent correction only if you are an extremely skilled trader but if you mess up just one such bubble trade by not hitting the right price levels 100% or some fuckup at the exchange (ddos or something) then you are going to lose what you had gained from the previous bubble and probably even more. You cannot day-trade in a market that is going up and up and up 80% of the time.

It is possible (for SilkRoad or any other hidden service) to make use of the **EntryNodes** and **StrictEntryNodes** directives in their hidden server's torrc to choose a fixed set of **trusted entry nodes** (nodes run by friends or other well known good nodes or even set up and run his very own entry nodes) instead of letting Tor choose them on its own, that way it would never attempt to connect to the attacker's entry nodes.
This should bring back easy sleep for the SilkRoad owner. He has proably done this already long ago.

1. There is no point in doing that, don't do it. Dont move private keys between wallets, you only create confusion and will one day shoot yourself into the foot.
2. Yes, make a copy of wallet.dat and put copies of it into multiple locations. Of course it must be password protected with a strong password. And you should do this in regular intervals because once its running out of keys (100) it will create new additional keys and you need to make new backups before this happens. Make a new backup *before* you have made 100 outgoing transactions. Alternatively if needed increase the number of precomputed reserve keys, refer to the manual of how to do that.
3. Its ok if its encrypted by Bitcoin-Qt, this encryption is strong. Of course only if your password itself is strong. I personally put my wallet backups along with a few other most important personal files (unrelated to bitcoin) all into one rar archive (additionally password protected) and backup only that one file.
You might also want to try out Electrum which has a slightly different concept, it demands that you write down 12 randomly created words on a piece of paper (all keys are created as a deterministic sequence from that seed) and then you can "backup" that paper. Unfortunately the paper is not encrypted, so if someone finds the paper he can restore your entire wallet. But it is also possible to memorize these 12 words and then destroy the paper, then you will be able to restore your wallet wherever you are without needing to access any backup files.

If you have the backup from the Schildbach wallet you can do one of 2 things (before the thief figures out how to move the bitcoins):
* import the backup into another Schildbach wallet on a different phone and then quickly transfer **all** coins to a safe unused paper wallet you have prepared beforehand for such emergencies.
* import the backup into a new empty MultiBit wallet on a Desktop PC (it is the same file format, so this works out of the box) and then immediately send **all** coins to the safe paper wallet.
If you are prepared for these steps (and maybe have tried it before with a few milli coins to be sure you know how to do it) this can be done quite fast (does not need to synch 2 weeks, only a few minutes).

If I understand this correctly then the real "meaning" of "money transmission" (what they originally intended to regulate when they came up with this kind of legislation, the real spirit behind it) is to regulate when someone does transactions *on behalf* of other people. When you make a service where money is *transmitted* by your service from A to B and not a service where money is only transmitted from A to the the service or from the service to A and there is no B involved in this at all.

Bitcoin transactions are by design irreversible. So if they are transferred to a wallet that is not owned by the provider of your the same online wallet service, if they have been transferred to some anonymous local software wallet or paper wallet somewhere else in the world there is no way to reverse it.
It might be possible to find the IP address that initiated it but this could also be misleading because it could have been done from a public place like a library or an internet cafe or a free or hacked wifi hotspot or it could have even be initiated **from your own computer** if it is infected and remote controlled, so it would look like a totally normal transaction initiated by you!
Bitcoin is like **cash**. If you open your wallet and the dollar notes are gone which were still in your wallet yesterday, there is no way to get them back if you don't know where they went. And there also might be no way for you to prove that it wasn't actually **you** yourself who spent them all last night, you could be lying or telling the truth, you could have amnesia, you could try to commit insurance fraud or you could be the victim of theft. There might be no way for anybody to prove anything!

Yes, that's how I interpret it.
OP could have just reported it to the police (in his own country) and probably the true owner would never had a chance to ever find out what was going on. 
But instead he made a post on r/Bitcoin in an attempt to do much more than that and **really** find the true owner. Now he should also take it into custody before someone else has a chance to guess the same weak passphrase and also report it to the authorities to make himself immune against any legal consequences.
PS: Of course I would not apply this interpretation to bitcoins that you "find" after you break into a computer system unauthorized or bitcoins where you **know** who is the true owner.

If you need **high** availability and want to trade or have your automated strategy connected and working even if no other client can connect anymore then use goxtool. 
If nothing else works anymore, goxtool will and if goxtool doesn't work then their servers are entirely down.

md5 is 128 bit, so you could pad it with 128 zero bits and use it as a public key in one of these online javascript bitcoin address tools.
Or you use sha-256 instead of md5 which gives you 256 bit that can directly be used as public key.
You can also use it to create a **private** key, send money to it and then spend it away again, then you lose 2 transaction fees but did not destroy any bitcoins.
later you can prove with the same tools that the same hash would produce the same address which has been used by you at that time.

* it is connecting directly to the normal p2p bitcon network (does not need to rely on a central service like Electrum or Blockchain.info)
* does not need to download the entire blockchain (only the headers and relevant transactions for the own wallet, so it works instantly after installation and does not need any noteworthy disk space or network traffic)
So it effectively combines all the advantages while avoiding all  the disadvantages. Another plus is that its wallet backup format is diretly compatile with the Android-Wallet (Schildbach) because its using the same engine (bitcoinj), so you can just import your Android backup to your destop wallet directly within a few seconds if something bad happens to your phone.

Its really hard to find a better strategy than buy and hold in a market that is trending upward so strongly. You **can** try to daytrade but since its already hard enough to do so profitably in a sideways ranging market (ask any forex trader) its even more difficult to outperform a buy and hold in a market that behaves like bitcoin.
You seem to underestimate how **hard** it actually is to daytrade and make a constant profit from it. Many experienced traders (and 99% of beginners) have lost their last shirt by trying to outsmart the market!

Or Electrum. Electrum will force you to write the seed on a piece of paper (on the first start (or when creating a new wallet) it will make sure you have correctly written down and then correctly typed in the 12 words), this will pretty much make sure you can't accidentally lose coins even if your computer explodes (without burning down the house of course).
Additional safety: Use an entirely separate computer (old and cheap) for Bitcoin and ONLY for Bitcoin. This can be connected to the internet too, you don't really need the extreme paranoia level of keeping it disconnected all the time if you just make sure this separate computer is not used for random other stuff and ONLY used to run the bitcoin wallet and NOTHING else. Recommended OS for this separate computer would also be Linux instead of Windows.

In practice it will probably much simpler. Most prices for common things to buy will have only a few significant digits, so it will become more common see prices that look like 
199 milli
4.95 milli
probably (until the micro becomes really significant) people will be able to express almost everything in terms of milli when they are not about to buy a space yacht with hyperdrive or some real estate in Elysium.
The only thing they really need to remember is the magic number of 3 zeroes like they already do when they know that $3000 means 3 grand or 3k and $6.8M means $6,800,000 and $3k for a coin means 3 bucks for a milli.

In my scenario there is no unconnected computer. Its based on the following (imho reasonable) assumptions:
* It is possible for the average person to obtain a clean installation medium (CD, DVD) for Xubuntu (or any other Linux based OS)
* The Linux OS after it has been installed does by default not have any network services running and can therefore be safely connected to the internet. Unlike Windows it cannot be attacked and infected by merely plugging in the network cable.
* The Bitcoin client has no remote vulnerability
* The user will not install any other software on this dedicated PC and will not use it for anything other than doing Bitcoin transactions.

No, you can't open the wallet file in notepad, its binary. Its some binary google protobuf format that is used by multibit. You either need to write some Java tool to manipulate the .wallet file directly or use the export/import function which uses a plain text file.
I don't recommend any of this, its only for advanced users who know exactly what they are doing. Everybody else will probably shoot himself into both feet. Also going via export/import will write keys to disk unencrypted, so afterward its needed to delete these files and then do a full free space disk wipe to not accidentally leave fragments of the backup files in unallocated sectors lying around causing a bad surprise 2 years later when suddenly coins get stolen for no apparent reason.

usually a pgp signed message is used for such purpose. 
Alternatively and especially in the Bitcoin space it is also common to sign a message with (and thereby prove ownership of) one of your publicly known Bitcoin addresses.
If you seriously have no clue about what that is and what that means or even the sheer fact that you had to ask such questions about such a simple obvious thing then Its very unlikely that you have any significant exposure or interest in such topics as "the Internet" or Bitcoin or other related things.

If its the **Schildbach** Android wallet then the wallet file will be in the /data partition of the phone for security reasons. Due to the folder permissions it can only be accessed either by the wallet app itself (which owns this folder) or by root, not by an ordinary file explorer or any other app, you also **won't** find anything on the sd card, this is internal memory of the phone.
If the phone happens to be rooted **and** it is still working (even without display) **and** android debugging is enabled **and** the shell has been granted root permissions then it would be possible to get a remote root shell with adb to access the contents of /data and copy them to /mnt/sdcard
You should ask in  what other options there might be depending on what type of phone it is and what exactly is broken.
Next time you install a wallet app then please follow the instructions to make a wallet backup. This is critically important and now you know why! This also applies to all desktop wallet applications, it even applies to all kinds of important things you store on computers, you should always ask yourself the question: What would I do if all my electronic devices I own suddenly all stop working (or get stolen), do I have a backup of all important data?
@_date: 2013-11-12 11:11:56


the transaction you have attempted to do would have done exactly this: collect all the tiny inputs and make them one output. But exactly this is what makes the transaction large (in terms of kilobytes) and this is why more fees are needed. You could try to send them anyways with lower fees but then you might have to wait a *long* time until its eventually picked up by a friendly miner who doesn't care so much about priorizing by transaction fee/size.

Also in many places posession of small amounts and consumption is not a crime at all. They primarily want to find the sellers, not the consumers, they know exactly it leads to *nothing* if they arrest a small buyer who only buys for his own personal needs on SR because (contrary to buyers in real life) these buyers on silkroad don't know anything and can tell them nothing about the seller they would not know already anyways, it would just be a complete waste of time and they know that.
@_date: 2013-09-12 14:13:54
no, its not trivial (I'm not saying "impossible" because nothing is really impossible but its far from trivial). An evil app that intends to steal data would first need to exploit some (unknown?) vulnerability to escalate its privileges, there is no normal way for a non-system app to request the needed privileges). Every app runs under its own UID and file- and folder permissions prevent apps from accessing other apps' data, every app has its own private folder for its own data that is completely isolated against all other apps (owned and readable only by this one UID) and even the user (the owner of the phone) cannot read these folders without first needing to root the device.

No, Tor (btw its not spelled TOR, its spelled Tor [so much for your knowledge about that matter, you can't even spell its name]) is a community project and its open source and run by individuals all over the world. Just like bitcoin. 
Paranoia is healthy and useful only up to a certain degree. Once you exceed this level you are quickly entering tinfoil-hat area and begin working *against* your own interests. If you want to know what Tor is and how it works I recommend you look at torproject.org and also ask community members and other people who know how it works or read the source code yourself. If you want to know how TorChat works (its not directly related with or sponsored by the Tor-project, only making use of its infrastructure) you can read the TorChat website, the TorChat source code or ask me or ask other people who can explain it to you.

it doesn't make any difference. When you mount your truecrypt volume then some trojan horse could read your entire ascii file and all your coins will be gone, no matter how many different keys it contains. What you are doing is extremely dangerous.

previous payments sent **to**you. 
Although they all seemed to be added up to one total sum by the wallet app when displaying how much you own they internally still stay as individual payments (unspent outputs) in your wallet and only when you **send** them it will do the job of actually bundling as many of them as needed together into one transaction (the unspent outputs will become the inputs of this transaction, thereby being marked as spent) and the **output** of this transaction will be put into the receiver's wallet (and a second output containing the change into your own wallet).
Your balance in your wallet actually consists of a set of unspent outputs of previous transactions to you and only when you spend them they will be bundled into a new transaction. 
They are not merged together when receiving, they are merged together when you send them.

a simulated exchange is a very good idea, but for successful trading you need more than only market orders in an infinitely (unreasonable) liquid market, you need to learn how a trader can place his own orders on the book and how that technique affects his own trading, how he can make best use of it and how his trading interacts with the trading of others or the market as a whole (for this it would also be nice to be able to experience (and learn) how it would be to trade with relatively large amounts in a relatively thin market).

I did't use a "graphing program" that does things "automatically". I plot the stuff myself because its me who needs to decide what to plot, how to plot and how to transform the data prior to plotting, so I now what I'm doing (or have a chance to learn how it is done).

And then the buyer will claim hat the USB was empty. And nobody will be able to prove anything. Either people will begin selling empty USB drives, scamming buyers or buyers will start claiming USB drives were empty scamming honest sellers. How should eBay decide in such a case when no proof of delivery exists?
The only way to transfer BTC or LTC or any other such coin in a provable way is to
* have the buyer give you his wallet receiving address
* document that
* transfer the coin
* document the transaction hash from the block chain.
If this is not possible on eBay **then don't do it!** Sending coin via physical USB drive is not provable for **anybody**, if eBay insists on that inferior way that proves nothing instead of letting you deliver and prove delivery correctly then eBay is either incompetent or **intentionally** trying to make people lose money and make transactions less reliable. In both cases it would not be recommended to use them for bitcoin sales.

I guess its probably not even possible to define what it even means "moving fiat into bitcoins" because actually there is no inside or outside, its all just money moving from one trader to the other trader, every bitcoin you buy is a bitcoin that is also sold by someone else, a dollar could move from me to you and some bitcoin could move from you to me, I might have used a limit buy order and you would have used a market sell order. fiat leak would show that someone sold btc but is this actually true? After all I bought the btc from you. Had we done it the other way around (you a limit sell and I a market buy) it would show a buy instead of a sell but what we did would have been exactly the same: You sold some BTC to me. Or I bought some BTC from you. Same thing.

A key logger watches every key you type all the time, so as soon as you enter the password anywhere on an **infected PC** you have lost.
It all boils down to the simple (or not so simple) task of making sure the PC where you are doing this is not infected with any type of malware. Its never possible to guarantee this 100% because these malicious softwares can hide themselves very well and you never installed them intentionally, so most of the time you don't even suspect that there might be an infection.
In my previous post I suggested using Linux instead of Windows because this is not (yet) the primary target for these types of attacks, key loggers and other malware are a very rare occurrence on Linux currently, so if you have the choice between multiple operating systems you should choose the one that is least likely to be infected with malware and only use that system to encrypt/decrypt important data and enter important passwords.
The encrypted key files themselves can then be stored anywhere or transmitted over the internet, they will not be cracked unless somebody somehow learned the password to decrypt them (for example by using a key logger on an infected PC as described above or by guessing a weak password)

This would happen automatically if miners are upgraded and start detecting such a block as faulty. They would regard the last good block before the first faulty block as the end of the chain and start mining from there. Upgraded clients (ordinary users) would do the same (discard the bad end of the chain and wait for new blocks on top of the last good block), users with old clients would have to wait until the new fork is longer than the old one and then automatically switch to the longest chain too.
So exactly like a few months ago all they need to do is make enough miners swich over from the broken to the good version of bitcoind and then wait until it resolves itself.

I have spend a lot of time developing it under these bad circumstances and tried my best to make it work under even under the worst conditions and make it handle even seemingly nonsensical server responses or inconsistent behavior that is not documented anywhere and only appears if gox is ddosed or otherwise acting erronreous. Of course if their servers are completely down then even goxtool can't do wonders. But its really trying hard.

LTSpice will interpret 47u as 0.000047 when you enter it into the text input field for a component value and it even has a config setting that explicitly enables using "u" as replacement for "µ" (IIRC its even activated by default). Using "u" instead of "µ" is acceptable, many softwares do it.

You mean kilo micro bitcoins? This is becoming more ridiculous every day, why introduce all that confusion with arbitrary artificial intermediate units that are **nowhere** defined? We already have bitcoin: 1 BTC is defined as 1 bitcoin. 
Thats the only unit we need. 
From here on we proceed with SI prefixes as usual: milli (mBTC) and micro (µBTC). 
Everybody can look up the meaning of "milli" or "micro" at wikipedia or ask his grandmother, she will happily explain it bacause its a well known standard and in widespread use since 1795. Your artificial "bit" as your private personal shortcut for µ฿ is defined nowhere, it does not make sense and nobody is using it.

This article doesn't make any sense. There is no indication of decreasing liquidity on the exchanges, quite the opposite, there is more and more fiat piling up on the bid sides of the books of the various exchanges, even on MtGox **alone** its currently already $33M and this is only **one** of many exchanges and not even the largest one anymore, this was a **single digit** number during the April bubble and there was only MtGox, now there are multiple and even bigger exchanges all over the world and MtGox alone has already $33M on the bid side. 
This article totally fails to back up his claims with **any** numbers, its all just made up assumptions and claims out of thin air.
Also he doesn't seem to understand how an exchange even works, judging from his confused notions of "settlement" and comparisons with exchanges in other markets. Probably he has a confused notion of what liquidity means either, that would also explain why he can't give any numbers.

Let me try to explain it. A script is written down instructions in plain text. For example this is a script:
    1. Open window
    2. Step on windowsill
    3. Move 1 step forward
Would you be afraid of something like that happening when its written on a website? Probably not. Of course it is possible to build a machine that would execute these types of scripts without asking questions and throw you out of the window automatically or do other harmful stuff and a lot of bad people would have a lot of fun coming up with even more damaging sequences of instructions that your machine would execute in an instant without asking questions.
Your web browser while browsing the web might execute scripts like this:
    1. open annoying second window
    2. load offending advertisement
    3. if window closed then go to 1
But the browser is (**SHOULD**) be designed in such a way that it won't do anything more dangerous than the above and just refuse certain instructions. Most of the time this works, sometimes it doesn't. This is why you should make sure your web browser and your operating system are always up to date, are configured correctly, do not have a ton of unneeded **plugins** (these can execute scripts too) and untrusted apps installed, don't have a bitcoin wallet on the same PC where you browse the web, and the OS and the browser do not have a bad track record of executing every funny nonsense it stumbles upon without asking first.

There are people arbitraging like crazy in Japan because they can get JPY out of gox within one business day. 
MtGox has internally only one order book for **all** pairs combined and all JPY orders (and all other orders for all other currrencies) also appear on the USD order book¹ (and can also be filled there **(and vice versa!)**) with an offset of a few percent which automatically covers their bank's exchange fees.
¹) Each pair (BTC/USD, EUR/USD, JPY/USD is actually only a different **view** of the internal book with all currencies that do not match this view's quote currency adjusted for their exchange rate and offset by a few % to cover the bank fees. So its entirely possible to dump a ton of BTC for JPY and be filled by USD bids.

Why do you need to care about an average? What practical value would that have? If for example you can only ever buy and sell at Bitstamp anyways because you don't have access to any exchanges in china or elsewhere, why would **you** care about their prices if you can only ever convert your coins at bitstamp prices anyways?
The same goes for other things too, for example gas: You don't care about the gas prices Saudi Arabia or at the South Pole or have them merged into one artificial average price that has no practical relevance for anybody, you only care about the prices in your area, prices that *you* have to pay.
If you are a merchant who is using BitPay then you will use whatever BitPay is quoting to price your items because its *them* who will convert your coins into fiat. If you live in Japan and can get JPY in and out of MtGox within less than one business day and you are using the MtGox merchant API for your online shop then you would of course base your calculations on the MtGox quotes and not the European or Chinese quotes.

No, this is the **public** key (actually its the hash of the public key, also known as "bitcon address" but thats only a minor detail, more important is that its public). The corresponding **private** key for each address is safely stored in the wallet file and is password protected and never shown as a qr code. Please read again the wiki section about bitcoin addresses and private and public keys.
The whole concept of private/public keys might be a bit confusing if you have never worked with encryption software before but its actually a widely used concept. For example if you ever used e-mail certificates in outlook these certificates that you use to encrypt email and that you use to verify signatures actually are public keys (they just call it "certificate") and the corresponding private key for each certificate is stored on the owner's computer and never given away. The same applies to pgp encrypted email, there is also the concept of private and public keys, the public key is given out to everybody and the private key is kept secret. Or think about certificates for https websites, they also are public keys while only the server owner has the corresponding private key securely stored on the server to be able to prove his identity with electronic signatures that are part of the ssl handshake.
public/private key encryption is around since the 70s and is used everywhere, its just often hidden behind marketing names like "certificate" and also "digital rights management" and even more stuff like that. It all boils down to the fact that there are always a pair of keys that invisibly belong together: a private and a public key. Messages signed with the private key are verified by using the public key. Messages encrypted with the public key can only be decrypted with the private key. 
Private == keep it secret, never show to anybody 
Public == give it out to everybody you want to interact with
The invention of the math that makes this possible was one of the greatest inventions of the last century. You don't need to now the math, all you need to now is what it makes possible: sign with the private key (for example sign a bitcoin transaction), verify with the public key. Or encrypt a message with someone else's public key and that someone decrypts it with his own private key (pgp, s/mime email encryption).

No, it isn't because that would conflict with "millibit" which is short for millibitcoin and according to your private definition of bit == 1µ a millibit would be nanobitcoin which is obviously something completely different.

Maybe you have a brand new computer with lots of cores and GHz and an SSD hard disk. Many other people have 5 year old computers with spinning disks and then it takes ages to download it, then its not bound by the internet bandwidth anymore but by the CPU and Disk-IO it needs to *verify* the blocks after downloading and this can be extremely slow on some older computers.

exactly. 
You can say 50u to mean 50 µBTC and you can say 100m to say 100 mBTC.
Engineers are doing it all the time: "This resistor has 100k and that capacitor has 47u" --&gt; translation: "This resistor has 100 kilo Ohm and that capacitor has 47 micro Farad". Look at any circuit diagram, they often abbreviate the values that way, they leave away the unit when its obvious that it can't be someting else. Even the software when simulating a circuit will accept entries like "100k" or "47u" or "12p" in the number input fields where you enter the values and parse it accordingly.
Number input fields for bitcoin apps could be made that interpret something like 13m and forward it to the software correctly as 0.013 and if you enter 0.013 directly it would also work.

All clients will use (or generate) a change address that is somewhere under the control of the client that is used. If not then its broken. You can only forget to include a change address if you construct the transaction manually which is **NEVER** recommended unless you are 101% certain to be knowing what you are doing.

**store them at home!**
Install Xubuntu Linux on an old PC or laptop (this will take only 15 minutes of your life and you will never regret it), then install Electrum and use this to keep your coins. The Electrum wallet will also force you to write down the seed on a piece of paper (keep this in a safe place) so you can restore your wallet on a new computer should the old one ever fail.
You don't necessarily need to do the whole dance with "never connected to the internet" if you are using Linux and don't install any other stuff on this computer. It is **NOT** sufficient to run it in a virtual machine on your every-day workstation, it **must** be a separate computer. It can be connected to the internet but it must be separate hardware.

There is also the wiki which has explanations for many of the things you need to know at the beginning if you are trying write your own node from scratch. Its not complete but it serves as a starting point, for example the information in the wiki would already enable you to write something that can connect to other nodes, parse and interpret the various protocol messages, send and request data from other nodes, etc. without having to look into the original bitcoin source at all. The wiki might be a bit chaotic but there is quite a lot of information in it that helps you understand what the code is supposed to do, that helps asking the right questions and finding our way through the original source code.

where does the mn_decode function come from? (god, I hate this language, nowhere it is clear where symbols come from, nothing is included, stuff is just coming together at runtime in random configurations out of thin air, how can people write reliable software in such a fragile environment at all?)
Edit: found it: 
    function mn_decode(str) {
        var out = '';
        var n = mn_words.length;
        var wlist = str.split(' ');
        for (var i = 0; i &lt; wlist.length; i += 3) {
            var w1 = mn_words.indexOf(wlist[i]);
            var w2 = (mn_words.indexOf(wlist[i+1])) % n;
            var w3 = (mn_words.indexOf(wlist[i+2])) % n;
            var x = w1 + n * mn_mod((w2 - w1), n) + n * n * mn_mod((w3 - w2), n);
            out += ('0000000' + x.toString(16)).slice(-8);
        }
        return out;
    }
Edit2: This is literally taken from the electrum python sources and translated into JS. It expects a seed consisting of **only** the words from the word list, for all other words the indexOf() method will always just return -1, no matter what word it actually was in position i of the pass phrase so it **may not be used with random selfmade pass phrases, they will all produce the same seed!**

So I cannot longer include a "buy me a beer" address in my software about dialog, I can no longer put it into my forum signature, even the smallest static website or README on github would need a monstrous amount of server side code to generate new addresses from a BIP-whatever public master key and also every tiny little useful shell script I write and give away that just includes a print "If you liked it, consider buying me a beer: 1ztzuitzt..." would now need to be bundled with bitcoind or depend on it?

The ISO standard recommends a non-breaking space (nbsp) every 3 zeroes instead of apostrophes and thats also what most people are doing when manually writing down such numbers on paper. But since the apostrophes cannot accidentally be confused with any other notation I have no objections.
But ultimately people will begin using milli and micro prefixes to avoid the zeroes as they do already in other areas, for example nobody would say: "I need a 0.003'5 m headphone jack", they will instead just call it a 3.5 mm headphone jack.

It happens in two stages. 
1. For a while price will violently rise from $0 to $fair_value (we are still very close to $0 on that scale). At the same time you can see the percentage of people owning and using Bitcoins also rising until market is saturated.
2. Now you can use it like every other currency because everybody else has a Bitcoin wallet too, so everybody can (and will) accept it and since its not rising in value so violently anymore and instead consolidating at $fair_value it will also not have such huge volatility anymore.
The only thing that remains unknown for now is where approximately $fair_value will be, but as market saturation will eventually come closer to high double digit percentages (its still &lt;1% today, so there is still much room) we will be able to make better estimates.

"tangible" is not a necessary property of money. For anything to become money it first has to have **all** of the following properties:
* scarce (impossible to counterfeit)
* divisible
* transportable
* durable
Any "thing" that has these properties **can** become money. "tangible" is not among the necessary properties, tangibility would not bring any advantages for the usage as money, it even conflicts with transportability in a world that transacts mainly online.

if your limit order is larger than what is available, say for example in your above example you had placed a limit sell of **19 BTC** at 710 and after filling all the bids down to and including 710 there will still be **9 BTC left in your order** and these 9 BTC will remain in the order book **as the new best ask**. 
the book will then look like this:

    ASK [...] other higher asks
    ASK [...] 
    ASK 710          9                            &lt;- this is you

MultiBit or Eletrum. 
Electrum is easier to backup (the seed and the deterministic wallet is really a killer feature) but feels a bit more unstable, new releases often have new bugs. Disadvantage: it needs to rely on external servers (but this can also be seen as an advantage, it makes it really REALLY fast and lightweight).
MultiBit is rock solid, its using the bitcoinj engine which is developed by Mike Hearn and well tested and proven to work, it does not need any external servers, it connects to other full nodes. Also nice: It can directly import Schildbach backups (and vice versa), so it is a nice companion for the Android Wallet and for emergency backup imports in case of lost phone. Disadvantage: Uses a collection of random keys (not deterministic, you need to backup more often).


Why? Java is a statically typed language with very strong type safety, much stronger than C++. Software written in Java generally tends to have fewer bugs and vulnerabilities.

AFAIK if they auction it off they are required by law to do it in a way that is "industry standard".

you can also enter a short hex number, even something as simple as ffff will work. You can also make your own seed (even longer than 128bits) with hexadecimal dice and enter that as a hex number.

Then let me say it this way: No Bitcoin client does this when clicking the "send" button, no bitcoin client has the address of this government oracle already built in to put it into outgoing transactions because this oracle does not even exist yet (and even if it existed it would not end up being built into the bitcoin client). 
Also its a difference between 
* "it can optionally do multisig transactions" 
* "it can optionally do multisig transactions and has a dropdown list with preconfigured official autorities of China, Iran, North Korea and USA"
* "it can **only** do multisig transactions and each transaction must include at least one of the following hardcoded list of authorities: China, North Korea, Iran, USA"
The last two variants is what this discussion is about and nobody would install such a software if he has the option to use variant 1. Pure logic and human nature dictates that.
Always remember: Btcoin is **not** going to play by their rules, this idea is absolutely ridiculous, instead they are eventually going to play by Bitcoin's rules because they cannot rebel against the laws of nature and against pure logic, they are powerless, even with all their guns, and the only thing they could achieve by bringing guns to a fight against pure logic and against human nature is to accidentally get killed themselves because of sheer idiocy of even trying to do that.

One just needs to read this made up fake customer support email about SMS mentioning Bitcoin, its obvious that this is utter bullshit: If the chinese would not want to receive certain SMS they would just block it themselves at the border or in their own cell phone networks and not ask western phone companies to please not send certain sms to china and a western cell phone provider outside of china would certainly not care about chinese laws or even terminate his customer's account because he's sending SMS to china.

**Stop orders** are planned but not yet implemented by them, you can **simulate** them by using a trading client such as goxool or goxgui that is running a bot which will constantly watch the price and then execute a **market order** once it reaches the desired price.

The usual way to work around the anonymity for the purpose of accounting (for example a merchant wants to know which order the payment belongs to) would be to create a new receiving address for every new invoice and use every receiving address only once. This might seem a bit wasteful at first sight but it really isn't. Creating new addresses all the time is what many bitcoin wallets already do anyways internally to manage the change from outgoing transactios, its a very cheap operation (its free) and can be done with a mouse click and it can even be done offline (it does not need to connect anywhere to create hundreds of new addresses). There are more possible addresses than there are atoms in the universe.
Payment providers like BitPay and others who provide bitcoin payment integration for online shops (and also solutions for POS) do this automatically and assign every purchase an individual new address, so it can be easily tracked in the merchant's books and he always knows which invoices have been paid.
In your wallet app you should find an option to generate a new receiving address and add a label to it, so if you give everybody who owes you bitcoin a different unique address you always know who sent you a payment.

Nobody can destroy it by inducing huge price swings. This would attract even more speculators who want to make a quick buck with limit orders, they absolutely **love** price changes across multiple orders of magnitude, so it would drive the demand and the average price even further.

No, this won't happen. You can't bid higher than the lowest ask. If you try to do it anyways will behave like a market order and will be matched immediately with existing asks, begining with the lowest ask and if that hasn't enough volume then the second lowest, then the third lowest and so on until your order is completely filled or you have consumed all asks at or below your bid. These trades happen exactly at the prices of these asks (it will actually be a rapid sequence of trades, one for each ask that is filled by your order). 
And if you sell (market sell or ask below highest bid) then the tades would execute at the prices of the highest existing bids, exactly the same way as explained above.

lol, yes, that would be very nasty. Everybody should have at least a quick look at the source code to see there is no hidden "magic" involved. Also after scanning, always have a quick look at the address in your phone to see that you indeed scanned the correct address (check at least the first few and the last few characters), especially if there are many addresses close to each other on the same page and you might have acidentally moved the mouse a few millimeters too far into the wrong direction.
Since you have no reason to believe I won't do bad things in the future you should disable auto-upates for this script after you have reviewed the code and found it to be ok. That way I cannot silently replace it with something else next month without your knowledge. You can than manually check for updates and review the diff to make sure everythng is still ok (won't happen very often).
I intentionally choose to make this script as simple as possible so its easier to understand how it works. There would have been an alternative way to code this, similar to the linkify plus script I could have tried to make it parse and rewrite the entire website, insert new elements and attach mouse handlers to each of them but that would have lead to an ugly monstrosity of code with a lot of special cases to make sure it would correctly treat all plain text addresses as well as existing a href="bitcoin:1someaddress". This would not only have made it more difficult to understand, it would have also slowed down page loading on large pages. So I choose the easy way with no rewriting at all and only one global mouse handler, this is also much easier to read and understand.

No, thats the famous Schildbach wallet.
Its based on bitcoinj, it has the same engine that is also driving the MultiBit wallet for Desktops. Like MultiBit it does not need to download the full blockchain, after installation it will work instantly. And it can do this without needing to rely on any special infrastructure or service, it connects to regular full (bitcoin-qt) nodes but is using a simplified verification protocol that does not need the full blockchain. I'm using it myself too on my Android and I also have MultiBit as my main Wallet on my Desktop. Both can also directly import each other's wallet backup files (because both are based on bitcoinj code) which is another huge advantage.
The wallet is protected aganst other malicious apps by Android's Linux file system permissions, each app on android has its own protected folder that can only be accessed by this app alone and nothing else. As long as you have not rooted your phone **AND** granted the root access to suspicious dubious apps you should be pretty safe. 
Of course if your phone is lost or stolen you should quickly try to move all funds out of the wallet using the key backup file and since this backup file can be directly imported into MultiBit (which you should have running on your desktop already) this might be possible fast enough before the thief notices that there is a wallet on the phone and figures out what to do with it. You shoud not use it for large amounts of Bitcoin anyways.

You won't lose anything. Import the paper and then transfer everything you won't need to a new paper wallet immediately. 
Example: You have a paper wallet with 50 BTC and you have a bitcoin-qt wallet with 0.42 BTC. Now you need 10 BTC from the paper wallet.
* import the paper wallet into bitoin-qt (now you have 50.42 BTC in bitcoin-qt)
* immediately send the 40 BTC that you wont need to a new empty (or another existing still unused paper wallet)
* burn the old paper wallet.
* now you have 10.42 in your bitcoin-qt available to spend and the remaining 40 BTC are again safely stored on paper.

no. If a catastrophic bug in the crypto is found then a different algo can be implemented and the blockchain can be forked from the block before the break onward. This would roll back all transactions to the time before the break and from there on it can continue.
Usually weaknesses in crypto algos are discovered incrementally, a small shortcut here, a few bits there, theoretical weaknesses only under certain conditions, lots of papers published, experts arguing about it, etc., it doesn't happen all at once over night, so once there are indications that it becomes less secure the fork to replace the crypto and other necessary measures can be planned and implemented ahead of time.

I strongly recommend not to import the "correct horse battery staple" key into any of these clients:
* Electrum
* MultiBit
The sheer amount of transactions will bring the wallet app and your entire computer to its knees, I had to delete and restore my wallet files (from backups) after this experiment because neither MultiBit nor Electrum would have even started anymore, all they did was suck up all available RAM and burn 100% CPU and remain unresponsive.
If you really believe you have enough RAM and enough time (or CPU) to try it anyways then you should at least make a **backup** of your wallet immediately before you begin with the experiment and be prepared to make use of it afterwards.

you can spot a bubble when it goes hyperexponential. Exponential growth would be a straight diagonal line in the log chart, hyperexponential is when it becomes steeper over time even on a log chart. Thats how to spot a bubble.
Currently its beginning to go hyperexponential again (on the small timeframe) but there is a lot of room to go until it begins to look as large as previous bubbles.

It might also just be one week from now or only a few days, smart people have placed a bunch of limit buy orders in the lower part of the ugly bloodbath that came after the crash, Of course it is not easy to judge where exactly this will be this time but you can at least roughly guess the order of magnitude that can be expected. It can very well be that price will collapse to 50% or 40% or 30% in one single day.
As soon as you see it going super-exponential (as it is now) in a logarithmic chart you should stop buying or even slowly begin selling a few (not all) coins. Or wait on the sidelines if you have none.
Its always moving in waves, there are periods of extreme hysteria (as it is now) followed by a violent bloodbath and then a relatively calm period. Never buy when the buying hysteria has broken out, instead wait patiently and then try to get cheap coins when there is blood in the market.
EDIT: btw I expect this bubble to be a little bit smaller than the last one and also the inevitable crash to be smaller than the last one, so don't wait for a read candle as large as the one after of the last correction, maybe this time its a bit smaller. Spread out your buying to multiple prices, buy even more if it goes lower than you have initially guessed.

Please consider using something other than Windows. Of all existing operating systems it has by far the worst track record as far as security, viruses, trojans and other malware is concerned. If you just get rid of Windows then this single decision alone will probably boost your security by a factor of 100 or more (conservative estimate based on reports of users who have lost their bitcoins to theft). 
There will be no absolute security ever but when you want to improve something you should start with the things that have the largest effect first and in your situation that would be moving away from Windows to something else (I recommend Linux, its easy to install and easy to use) and also move away from a publicly accessible system with hundreds of other users to a privately owned computer used only by yourself.

I fitted a line y=ax on the raw (linear) data, I used the lm() function for this. Then I plotted the data and the line (just switched the plot function to log-log). I should instead first have log() all my data first and then have fitted the line on that, then I could easily also plot a meaningful standard deviation and the residuals from the fit would not be so badly skewed.
I would have to change 3 lines in my code and probably again spend some time with the user manual looking up some obscure parameters for lm() to constrain the line in such a way that it still would go through origin on the original data.
But fortunately all that is not needed because it does not really matter, all I really needed was to somehow put a line (any line!) through origin next to my points to see that it roughly has the same slope.
I did not intend to write a scientific paper about it and postulate the universal law of the bitcoin candle heights and then manage other people's money based on m theory about the exact slope of this line and its error. I just wanted to know if such a line could possibly exist and it looks like it. Thats all.
If you really want to know the exact numbers (why would you?) then I suggest you use your sophisticated fully automated "graphing program" (whatever that might be) and tell it to automatically reproduce my plots in better quality with all bells and whistles (and have a cup of coffee while you watch it doing the work and figuring out what you want) and maybe even let it automatically write a paper about it and determine the slope and the error of that line to the 3rd decimal.
For me it was just a quick &amp; dirty throwaway scatter plot to quickly gauge the relationship between price and candle size. I do not intend to spend any more time with this plot because I have seen what I wanted to see after 1 second looking at that plot already (even completely without the line).
I have posted my source code, so you can easily continue where I left and bring it to 101% perfection.

The chart is actually a little bit confusing, actually it does not make sense to count the bid side in BTC, you can only count it in USD. On the ask side there are BTC up for sale so you can count the total amount of BTC on the book but on the bid side its USD that is up for sale! So to sum up the actual **size** of the bids you have to multiply every bid amount of BTC with its USD price, so a bid of 100BTC @ $1 is worth $100 (you are selling $100) exactly the same as bid of 1 BTC @ $100
Once you have the total bid sum in USD and the total ask sum in BTC you can also calculate the ratio sum_bid/sum_ask which would in a healthy orderbook in a well balanced market hover around the current market price. This once happened to be true on MtGox before their withdraw problems began, now the orderbook is very unhealthy asymmetric, these are the current numbers as calculated by goxtool in realtime (taken from their API):
    sum_bid: 30,726,953 USD | sum_ask: 26,347 BTC | ratio: 1,166.22 USD/BTC
There is also a website (have forgotten the url, must search it) that tracks this ratio vs time along with the price in the same chart. It used to be a leading indicator for price but since the problems at MtGox begun its more useful as a measurement of how unhealthy asymmetric their order book is currently.
**Edit:** here is it:  at the very bottom of the page are bid sum / ask sum charts. You can see how much the ratio suddenly began to decouple from price when the problems began and nobody wanted to sell anymore on gox.
**Edit 2:** its coming closer to the price again, ask sum is increasing, maybe the market turning (short term) bearish?

and to avoid this confusion the menu item in question is clearly labeled to indicate what exactly is to be closed. Its labeled "close **wallet**" and not "close program" or only "close" without anything. 
How else would you label the menu item to close the file in an application that is designed to have multiple files open at any time? Also this is not a destructive action, no harm is done when closed accidentally, the user can just open the Wallet again with the menu item that is labeled "Open Wallet". The guidelines you cite are there to **avoid** confusion by making it a convention in all programs, so users get used to it even without reading them. Are you suggesting it would be a better idea to ignore all conventions by creatively hiding or renaming or abusing commonly used menu items and UI metaphors to create even more confusion?

Bitcoin can be seen as a distributed autonomous corporation, an unmanned corporation living in cyberspace that has contracts with earthly miners who feed it with hashes and people who own "shares" of it and its providing a valuable service for the people on earth for a small fee (which it is using to pay the contractors who feed it). And since its a non-profit company it does not pay dividends, but it **has** value.

Bitcoins are not "turned into money", they don't transform into something else, they are sold and after that they still exist, just someone else holds them and you hold his dollars.

+1 for "double retard"
SI prefixes don't need to be stacked on top of each other because that would create even more confusion. If one does not understand the prefix in the first place how can he be expected to understand 2 of them stacked on top of each other?

Android Wallet is using the bitcoinj engine which does the simplified verification protocol (it does not need to store the entire blockchain). If you want the same experience on your desktop computer then install MultiBit which uses the same engine. Then you could even exchange wallet backup files directly between the Android wallet and MultiBit because they are 100% compatible.

That kind of fraud is actively enabled (encouraged?) by PayPal because their incompetent strategists still have this delusional idea of being able to win a war against innovation and against the future of money and payment with their obsolete business model and arrogant business conduct.
They could easily stop these frauds (if they wanted) by accepting a confirmed Bitoin transaction as proof of delivery, they could even go further and simply enable direct funding of (and withdrawal from) a PayPal account via Bitcoin and even process off chain payments denominated in Bitcoin between 2 PayPal accounts and profit from it.
**In 2 years from now** PayPal will accept and use Bitcoin because they have no other choice and they will even try to make it look like **they** were the ones who revolutionized online payments and it had been their idea all along.

That's not true! It can encrypt the wallet!

Why not?
Why should this shift that is currently already happening (at a rate that is increasing every day) suddenly stop? Does not make any sense. What supernatural power should stop this unstoppable process?

I just need to tell them where to find and how to decrypt my wallet. 
At the time of my death (or a few years after my death should I die tomorrow) it will be **common knowledge** what bitcoins are and how to use them. **If not** then they will be worthless anyways and it won't matter. 
Remember: There are only 2 possibilities: either it goes to zero or it will be mainstream. There is no in-between.
