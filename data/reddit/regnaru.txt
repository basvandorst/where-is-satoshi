That has to be 50% ofcourse ;). I'm willing to take that bet that it will touch the 9k within 2 months. If you are so convinced it would never go there anymore, let's find a 3rd party and put money on it?
For the symbolic nature of it, let's say 0.5 btc?

I believe the 18th dec news is already heavily priced in. Like i said in a previous post, "buy the rumors and sell the news" ;). Most of my indicators favor a bearish move to come. TA isn't always correct, but this year it has been 80-85% correct for me. And when the indicators are this high, i'm pretty convinced on it.

I will remind you when you're wrong ;). Why would you think it wouldn't be able to hit that level? If it hits 3k, it's still above the main uptrend level. Still a lot higher than the start of 2017. So not unrealistic at all. When btc hit 1k for the first time there were also people yelling it wouldn't go below 500 usd anymore for sure, just google how low it went. When fear strikes and media reports how much it dropped during a normal correction, things can easily drop to those kind of levels. Same as how it can push a coin 1000%, it can easily push it down 50% in half the time (fear moves faster).
Another beautiful part is that lots of people now yell they will put in all their money if it reaches 6k. Then see a big drop below 6k.... what do you think will happen to 95% of the people? They see their value decrease by 5-10% a day for 1 week straight... and will potentially sell when the fear is getting the upper hand (yep pretty close to the bottom of the crash). 
People at that stage think btc is dead, gets no more big media attention for awhile... consolidates a bit... and then starts a new recovery and rally phase. I have seen it before from 2013-2014. Allthough i have to mention those phases will be a lot shorter now as the overall attention increases by developments and expanding larger investers.
The TA's on wallstreet will take 1 look at the current graph and will definatly not step in at current price levels. They too are waiting too buy into a panic selloff "correction". Or are looking to short when the bull is exhausted.
Overall i'm bullish on bitcoin, but the market pushed it too high too fast. That's why i think its due for a solid correction.

For the long term those positions are good anyway. Even if it dips to 6k or even 3k. If the year after that it's 30k, who cares right? I'm one of those people who think btc can easily get to 200k by 2021 and even beyond that (I think mcafee will eat his own dick tho) but bulls can run far.

Well... depends on your timing ofcourse. This year i'm up a lot more than i would have by just hodling. However, it also requires a lot more time than just hodling. It just isn't for everyone, as some people i know have tried it and made all the wrong choices/mistakes that they can possibly make. For the average person who is interested in crypto i never recommend day trading. Instead i recommend them investing small amounts of money each month for the longer term (3-5 years minimum). That is after they have done their homework on cryptocurrency and they are behind the whole concept. Investing just because they saw the gains on the news but don't really understanding anything about it is just plain dumb to me.

And there was the 10.150 dip so far, Rode it like a charm from 11.8 to 10.2. Next dip aiming for 9.5-9.6k area. After that it could form a nice H&amp;S when it moves back up to 10.8-11k area. Just for fun (i'm no financial advisor for anyone here) 8K area 1st target after a H&amp;S formation, then it's 6K and perhaps we are in for a treat down to 3K. ;)

I'm more thinking this sort of thing will play out &gt; 
Regardless i'm very carefull with my trades in such an extended market unless i have clear indicators to make the trade.
@_date: 2017-12-02 15:26:02
Depends on the market/opportunities. But roughly 3 a day. Not only bitcoin.

And this is how bulls get trapped. ;) There is a major red flag atm for the short term. Rising that fast after such a major sell off is just not sustainable for another big bull run. I base my trades mostly off TA, which is telling me to go short or just stay away untill it reaches certain key levels. Now on the other hand if you plan to invest long term (let's say 3-5 years), there is nothing to worry about... it will go up again. But some people get stressed when they buy at the peak for the ''long term'' and end up cashing out short term at the worst possible moment.

Oh yeah, and i'm not a financial advisor. Do with my story as you like, it's just my point of view on the current market. :)

I found the high volume downwards spike to 8.8k a very good indicator of a reversal in trend. The very fast run upwards also an indicator that it's not sustainable. With former corrections you saw that the buildup was also fast, but nothing like this run. I cashed out most of my mid term portfolio at 10.5k because i saw the madness driving the market up. Then i went short at 11.2k all the way till 9.1k. I made a few small trades on the way up again and currently waiting to go short again when it breaks a key level. When i hear stories on the news of a danish mom buying btc for her sons saving account... i know its a great time to wait on the sideline or take shorts on the right moments.

Bitfinex and Kraken. Bitfinex for the fast momentum trades, as kraken is too laggy for that.

It depends on your intentions of investing. I have a close friend who only adds money on every dip bitcoin makes and hes in it since 2015. His returns are very rewarding for very limited time spend checking out the market. If you would be like him and have no intentions on day trading, i would certainly not sell. 
If you are looking to make trades every day and have only intention to add to your long term portfolio when the crash looks the most bloody/bearish like me. Then i find 11-13k a very good target to sell in. As i don't care to miss out on maybe 10-20% as the risk grows higher for a solid correction on the shorter term.
I'm saying this in every post, on the long term i'm very bullish. Bitcoin won't suddenly die off even if it makes a correction to 3-6K. Only governments can kill a crypto like bitcoin, but just partially. Currently the market cap is way too small for the governments to worry too much. Once we get close to gold (7+ trillion) it will become a whole different story for governments.

At least to 10.1k if it wants to make a next leg up. However i think we need to go back to 7.9-8.1k range to continue any bullish pattern. The market seems very stretched but bulls can run far. If the 7.9 level breaks we will test 6k level and if that one breaks it's basicly going down towards the 3k zone (which is the long term trendline) so that a full new bull cycle can begin. below 5k people will begin to panic sell. When people fear the most it's when i start to buy.

Well in short term trading it will go like this ''buy the rumors, sell the news''. I feel the current price is a reflection of those institutional investors stepping in already. People will see less direct effect in the short term and start to sell out (due for a major correction). Then the cycle starts all over again with this time institutional investors spiking up prices even more in the next round (30-40k end 2018?). Like i said, stick to a strategy. If you are long term, just don't panic and stick with your plan. If you trade actively like me, this was the time to sell off.
@_date: 2017-12-03 01:17:12
That's when you start to accumulate. ;) Don't forget i'm bullish on the long run. But when 99% of the active traders are greedy and only 1% is fearful thats a sign for a daytrader to step out or take shorts at strategic points.
@_date: 2017-12-03 11:57:17
The consolidation gave that breakout away. Exactly the reason why i'm waiting on the sideline, as going long or short are both very risky at the moment.
