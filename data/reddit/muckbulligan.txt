Of course. What else could it mean? You say it like taxes are a bad thing.

misspent = things I don't like
"Misspent" is nearly always a subjective ordering of priorities. We elect representatives who most closely agree with our own priorities to fight for funding for those priorities.

Stock buybacks. Since the "recovery" (which really was banking, everyone else was just a victim of it), corporations have become flush with cash because they were too afraid to invest it. Eventually they had to do something with it, so they bought back stock by the tons to make stockholders happy by increasing the value of their stock, and made CEOs happy because they have stock options. 
But by not investing in their businesses, eventually the chickens will come home to roost and these stocks will plunge once they lose market share to those who have invested in the future. Frankly, I wouldn't invest in any company spending all their cash on stock buybacks. Eventually these CEOs are simply going to cash out, jump ship, and leave their former company with no plan for the future.
