Nope,   
Existing payment platforms for bitcoin and ethereum are centralized messes, most of them even charge you invisible fees that are higher than they even advertise. A current secret system in the crypto payment space is to "Weight" your bitcoin transaction value about 1% in the favor of the company that you're exchanging with, and then charge a 1% fee on top of that.   
The same centralized mess that follows credit cards is following bitcoin around right now, and it'll take truly decentralized services to shake it.

Last i checked there's a real latency issue with worldwide communications in this fashion. **Rough math alert:**
The circumference of the earth is **40,000 km**? This means that at the speed of light, the actual maximum speed we can transmit internet between two locations you would have a two way packet speed of about **133ms to go halfway around the world if we laid the pathway against the earth's surface.** The current speed of fiber optic technology would still cap us at about 2/3rds of the speed of light, so **200ms** or so.
From the Wiki each satellite would be in the range of 550km Low earth orbit. Adding 1100KM to the diameter of the earth to calculate the route the data must travel in addition to 550km up to the network and 550km down to the ground again. Assuming each satellite would communicate with one another without cutting corners. This satellite to satellite transmission would travel at the speed of light, but then suffer speed loss within each satellite as it was rebroadcast. I don't have a way to calculate that so we'll just keep it in mind.
This would be **4ms of latency added to all communications worldwide** due to the **additional distance traveled up to space and down again**. Then an additional 1800km in distance that information would travel on that same trip around the earth. We're looking at the ballpark of roughly 10ms added for a one way communication and **+21ms for a two way conversation**.  This would put the **best possible speed at roughly 154ms** in comparison.
This is of course assuming that both networks are magic and instantly rebroadcasts anything. 
Don't take this as a negative opinion, just interesting math.
**Edit\*** Math: provided the actual orbiting distance of the satellites so i didn't have to use average LEO as an assumption and could clean up the math.

Looks like it's actually 2/3rds of the speed of light in a fiber optic cable. Additionally current technology seems to be hitting only 70-80% of that.

These always crop up when bitcoin is moving upwards, then go bankrupt and can't pay you when it goes back down again.

Trust in journalism, journalists and news media is currently at a worldwide low. Mathematically it's currently safer to take the opposite advice of whatever a journalist tells you.
