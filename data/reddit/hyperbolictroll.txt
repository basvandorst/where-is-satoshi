It's not like the watch itself seals the deal, but paired with nice clothes and good grooming, every little bit goes a long way in making you look like you give a shit. No guy in history has fucked a girl because he liked her earings, but it's the same concept.

It doesn't sound like any of those things you listed. He's not asking for sympathy or help getting the money back, he's labeling them as thieves.

Bitcoin is and it isn't. If I hypothetically had 1000 BTC donated to me, there is nothing connecting any of that 1000 BTC to me, only the donors. And with the potential to make off the record transactions and tumble coins, it's very possible to spend them all without leaving a single breadcrumb. So although it is not an inherently totally anonymous system, it definitely does allow it.

New and sophisticated? BTC donations have been going strong with anonymous donations for the better half of the decade. It would be newsworthy if people were actually donating. It's absolutely trendy and clickbaitworthy, and I cannot fault their business side for these articles, but their journalistic side is dead and in the gutter.

I heard terrorists even use Oxygen and Water! We gotta put our feet down and regulate that shit!

I use the supposed worst of the worst, BoA, and I get low interest but enough to account for inflation, fast transactions, and have never had a transaction fee. In addition, it's FDIC ensured. So in most ways, it's still way better and more secure than bitcoin for holding wealth, especially since the dollar is more stable than bitcoin, and is accepted everywhere. Mind you, I have assets in BTC as well, but if you believe BTC storage is universally inferior to bank storage you are delusional.

I don't even know where you can get service as bad as he mentioned. Free no credit check account at BoA is miles better than what he claims banks do and you can do a whole hell of a lot better than that. Pretty much anything is.

I laughed at how stupid your post was because half of those things never happened.

Yea. Vanilla Visa, for example, is $5. So a $100 card costs $105. You also can't reload them, so the small amount of leftover money after spending usually goes to waste. They actually make most of their money from people forgetting or having nothing to do about the leftovers.

It wouldn't at all because it's not hacking. Calling scripters hackers is pushing it but calling people who press a report button hackers is too far. (PS I realize you probably meant marketing, just had to)

I disagree. I don't pirate media because I am unwilling to pay for content. I do it because a majority of the content delivery systems in place are unreasonable. Take television for example. Cable and Hulu force you to pay for tons of chanels even if you only want 3, force you to watch ads on top of your subscription, bleep profanity, and pull content that sponsors won't like. And the alternative, paying $3 to buy an episode you will watch one time is absurd.

DPR was also operating a site as a political statement about freedom and thus had a reason to spread a message (in addition to free publicity for said market). A thief has no reason to advertise.

If you're morally polarized as good or bad you die. If you're somewhere in the middle you have a chance.

The ironic thing is that pushing people using VPNs for shady activity to bitcoin is actually helping them hide their tracks better.

Honestly, for this policy you can just send to an external wallet, like brainwallet or multibit. But if you want to be thorough, there is ways to make it undetectable.
There is a process called tumbling where, basically, you send BTC to a company then they send a combination of BTC from other sources totalling the original amount to another wallet. To anyone looking, be they law enforcement, coinbase or whomever, it is virtually impossible to tell from the blockchain that they went from your one wallet to the other. Bitcoinfog is a very popular one. You need tor to access it though.

It's legal, but you have to pay taxes on the gains because it counts as income. Talking about USA, might me different elsewhere.

I'd tell you you're right, but those shovels aren't worth much anymore considering you missed the gold rush by about 3 years.

Please, get that tin foil hat logic out of here. You can't just make a claim like "they could have fabricated the evidence" to invalidate the entire concept of evidence. In doing so you are accusing the FBI of a crime with no evidence to back it up. So that argument collapses on itself hard. Why grasp for straws like that when there are valid arguments supporting his innocence, such as entrapment?

For sure. Every time someone's BTC gets stolen, the "I told you so" squad comes in to point out what "stupid" mistake they made, usually things 99% of regular users would want to do. As long as something as simple as holding your BTC on an online wallet is not secure, it will never hit mainstream.
