Author doesn't really know what he is talking about but got one thing right.  This will never happen in Bitcoin....... because Bitcoin isn't good enough to do it!  Let's examine this statement. 
1) there is no hard fork and "NEM Devs" aren't centralizing control of the chain. What is being done is an off-chain smart logic combined with on-chain smart assets which are being created to watch and mark funds. Let's also note that the "NEM Devs" are not in the Foundation.  That is like saying the Bitcoin Foundation controls Bitcoin; it doesn't.   
2)This makes uses of the truly decentralized NEM API, and the fact that NEM has a great built in messaging system for each tx that includes plain, encrypted, and hex messaging up to 1024 bytes, and NEM is a blockchain of many different kinds of smart programable assets. Taking advantage of the great API, has let third-party devs (not core-devs) build automated protocols for watching and tagging accounts as coins move.  NONE of these does Bitcoin really have. 
3) Tracking coins has long been done in Bitcoin by many parties to track stolen coins, but never with this ease, detail, or level of options.  NEM has done in 24 hours what probably took Bitcoin months to do and doesn't even do 1/10th.  
So yeah, you can bet this won't ever happen on Bitcoin.

I sent 0 fee txs in the early days of Bitcoin when blocks were not full. It should still be possible today too.

I've heard a lot of people talking about the weakness of creating keys over the internet, and yes I believe it is possible too so I am not arguing that, but...... can anybody name one instance where a Blockchain.info or Coinbase account with 2FA was ever compromised?  I am just wondering.  I've heard about people who had infected computers with no 2FA getting their coin stolen, but has it ever happened with 2FA? 
I am just wondering because there is a difference between "could happen" and "does happen". 
I'm asking because I am not too technical on these things and I don't want to keep my money in someplace that gets hacked a little now and then.

I am a Coinbase user. I am keeping most of my coins in the vault and a copy of the keys tucked away.  For it to get hacked, a person has to get my Coinbase password, my 2FA, and then a separate vault password.  (I guess all this was possible in this phishing attack) But then there is a delay of two days where they send me text messages and emails multiple times with a single click "cancel transaction link".  I pretty much feel like this is a rock solid option for long term storage of my main bitcoin wallet.  Said attacker would have then have to had gained physical possession of my phone and locked me out of two different email accounts, both of which are also using 2FA.  Scammer/Phisher/Hacker foiled at that point.   
On top of that Coinbase has taken the loss on this one and will refund his money.  Yes, he fell for a phishing attack but Coinbase also understands his situation.  Think that would have happened with Gox or Mintpal.  This kind of situation just boosts my confidence in Coinbase and there ability to make their service top notch.

I got an email in 1996.  Every single one of my family members thought I was stupid for having one, and most of my friends too.  The only other person I knew that had one was another family member who worked in IT and his was for work.  Everybody said, "he needs it for work," you are just silly for having one.  The fact is that for a long time email was ignored.  People didn't feel like a digital message was real.  It had to be on paper.  They were worried about digital things getting lost and thought you would have to print each one up and file it.  I argued and argued about how it would be good. 
Bitcoin is the same.  Bitcoin solves lots of problems that people don't even know they have right now.  It doesn't solve them well (yet) and has a very low distribution.  But in a few years the rate of use will be much higher, applications better, and ease so much better.  Some people will wonder how they managed in the old days of today.

I really hope that more Bitcoin companies uphold this standard of "Bitcoin before company".  It will really be better for everyone.  
@_date: 2014-10-30 15:16:46
So, if I hear you correctly, you are saying at some point they could "get me".  But in that case, I think the hacker would just be able to get a few people before getting caught, right?  I mean sooner rather than later people would notice their coin was gone.  At that point Coinbase would be doing a review.  It isn't exactly like a Gox situation where all the coins disappear for everyone.  On top of that, if in the rare event a hacker was working in Coinbase and did that, then I think they are still supposed to be insured, and also probably have quite a bit of money in the bank that they could easily just write a check to cover a small amount of losses.  
Again, these are just assumptions and I don't really know as this is all kind of still new to me.  Have I gone off track here?

South Korea:
Buy with credit card - working - 2.9% cc fee
Sell to credit card - working - didn't try
Buy from bank account - didn't try
Sell to bank account - didn't try
Used a Deagu Bank BC/Visa credit card.  Worked really easy just like others said.

I doubt that what you want will ever be supported on Bitcoin.  But the 2.0 platform NEM has blockchain based multisig so for instance a person can start a transaction on the desktop with one app from one 3rd party, and then sign on a mobile with a different app from a different 3rd party.  Neither of which are collaborating nor need too as the support is built into the NEM core.

Dear Satoshi, I bought at $1000 and have watched it go down every since.  And..... I don't care.  It has been so much fun reading about bitcoin, learning about the future it might bring.  Whether bitcoin ever makes it or not, I am having fun.

reminds me of Hope Gold Coin where there wasn't any gold in the coin.  But here each coin is backed by "1" gram, but I am guess that the vault that holds all those 1 grams is empty. 
@_date: 2015-01-04 18:25:07
but look at it from a the perspective of the investor.  $1,000,000 must be pumped into Bitcoin every single day for the marketcap just to hold level.  And if that new money doesn't come in, the price goes down.  But with a PoS, if $1,000,000 of new money comes in, then the marketcap goes up $1,000,000.  If no money comes in, then the marketcap stays the same.  Yes, with PoS, the first comers get more, but with PoW you have to hope late comers will prop you up.

Sorry for the late reply.  The answer is "trust".  Simple as that.  It doesn't matter if it is centralized or not.  The thing that is important is that it is a system that is not abused and can be trusted.  It happens that  decentralization is a very good method to help insure trust, but it is not the only model. The important thing is that we have a "proof-of-x" to allow us to know there is trust.  Bitreserve has a real time proof-of-reserve.  Trust is there.  The reality is that trust is the thing that we need, and the system which works the easiest and the best to make trust is the winner.  Bitshares is way over complicated, Bitreserve is not.  Both have decent forms of trust. 
@_date: 2015-01-04 18:21:22
I'd use Bitreserve way before I would use Bitshares.  It is completely centralized, but they constantly update proof-of-funds in real time.

very cool idea.  it is really interesting to see how multisig is coming together to build a better bitcoin.  once somebody can combine multisig with smart contracts though, then huge utility will open up.

It doesn't really matter who he supports.  The math is solid.  
Even if you say it is only 0.5% a day, guess what happens after 100 days.  
My math says it is down 50%.  Those little percentages add up day by day.  
The fact is that miners need to be supported, and they are only supported when new money comes in every single day. 
If no new money comes in, then the price has to drop.  
@_date: 2015-01-10 17:49:33
It means after 100 days, you have had 50% loss.  That is quite an expensive project to keep maintaining.

My internet is 40,000 times faster than it was 10 years ago.  I'm expecting so more impressive gains in the next 10 years.   Sure hope we still don't have 1 megabyte blocksizes then too. Ridiculous that people don't want to upgrade a system on a nice regular rate when everything else does so.  
@_date: 2015-08-17 05:01:46
Satoshi always meant bitcoin block size to grow.  Why? Because it is reasonable that a tech like bitcoin would need every expanding blocksizes to accommodate ever expanding transaction volumes.  
A select group of deep pocket bitcoiners are greedily protecting their personal stash while trying to halt Satoshi's plan (the reasonable plan) greedy miners saying it will lead to centralization when it is they they are pushing bitcoin to centralization.  
Those involved in Blockstream who have have been given millions of dollars from VC's and now have an obligation to deliver to their corporate masters (even though they claim they have no obligations.  like surely somebody gives you millions of dollars and expects no favors in return.  come on!)  
Blocksizes need to be increased on a regular rate and 4% every so often is a reasonable method.  
+1 for the XT.  I know which code my node will support.  
@_date: 2015-08-17 05:09:55
He probably isn't Satoshi. There is lots of evidence that points that way, but then when you look very closely, it turns out not to be the case.  
Regardless, he is the spirit behind 90% of Bitcoin and it was basically his idea.  Not just Bitcoin but his ideas are the inspiration for Ethereum too and quite a few other things that we will see in the future.  
It is pretty clear that he is now in favor of block increases.  Sathoshi was clearly on record as in favor of block increases.  Gavin wants block increases and all of them are doing it for the tech, not for their own person gains and profiteering.

good case for using encrypted messages on platforms like NEM. 
@_date: 2015-04-28 15:08:22
there are really only two reasons no matter what people say.
1) is to buy drugs and other illegal things
2) not to pay high fees at Amazon, eBay, and PayPal, though people might quickly find out in OB that those extra fees being nailed on to the sellers actually do go to cover lots of expenses and give a lot of buyer and seller protection, services which will be sadly lacking in OB.  
So that just really leaves us with 1 again.

Actually, watches, good watches, appreciate in value over time.    
Many nice watches like a Rolex are worth more than the day you bought them.  And especially limited edition watches that are rare and sought after pieces can really go up in value.   
If you are a true believer in Bitcoin, and you think it will go to $100k USD, then think of all the other Bitcoiners that will want a limited edition watch that was the first ever high-quality Bitcoin watch. The original "Bitcoins" from Cascious coins now sell way more than they were worth at the time. On top of that, this watch has a blockchain certificate of ownership that comes with it so you can prove it wasn't counterfeited.

yes.  the alligator band was a little squeaky in the video because it was so new. but that went away quickly with the smallest drop of oil.  everything else about it and how it looks is wonderful. 
@_date: 2018-12-09 14:04:30
The watch is made partially out of gold, but I don't quite think it is the same thing as gold taps in your bathroom. I do get you and agree that there is something for understated style that is classy. But there is also something about supporting your tribe or team and that is why wearing a football jersey at a match is still great even if it isn't classy. I consider this watch more classy that wearing a Bitcoin t-shirt but still shows the real level of enthusiasm if not more because of all the money I had to drop to get it.  I BTW am a long time and big-time fan of Bitcoin. I also have a big ass custom made Bitcoin sticker on my car. Is it classy? Nah, but then again I designed and placed it in a way it looks great, so I don't care, I like it.
@_date: 2018-12-09 13:56:04
 Technically, a $200 mass produced Casio watch has more function and actually tells time better. And I think that is where many people are getting confused because to them it means "better".   
The point of this watch is, that it is the first of its kind, that it is in limited supply, and that it speaks to a tribe or people.  This is very much like artwork. Many of the people complaining about how much art costs are right, you can get a poster from Walmart of a Picasso, and it might even be laminated with plastic so technically, it will keep the true color of the Picasso's vision longer than the original, but the original handmade painting will always be worth way more because of its limited supply and that it speaks to a certain tribe of people.   
Expensive and limited edition handmade watches are just the same as collectible rare coins whose value far exceeds the metal in them. The same with baseball cards or clothing from Supreme. I've also been lucky with other watch purchases in that my watch collection has actually gone up in value, not down since the day I bought it. I'm sure this piece will too because Bitcoin will just keep on getting better and better and in the long run be so much more popular and expensive.
