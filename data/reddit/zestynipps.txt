They are sold out on most sites. The ones priced at $2000 require a preorder and won't be shipping until January or February. Once you get your s9 up and running it could take you several months before you break even. However, once you break even it's like printing $$$
What you choose to do is really contingent on what happens to the price of BTC over the next few months. If BTC has another run and your money is tied up in a pre-order you could miss out on gains.

I would say no.
Just do the math to weigh the cost/profit of owning a miner vs buying bitcoin. Personally, I would rather own .25 BTC than a $3400 processor that I might not be able to resell.
If you really want to mine I would suggest building a gpu rig rather than go for an asic. It's fun to build, works for gaming, and you can always sell the parts when mining is no longer profitable.

The 'bubble' has popped a hundred times over. People will see bitcoin on sale and buyers will step.

I actually don't know what rootmining is. Could you enlighten me?
Not sure that cloud mining is a scam, but it does seem like a bad deal. You can buy a contract to mine BTC for $845 with genesis to receive 5000 GH/s for two years. That would earn you about $12 a day (today). The problem with this scenario is: 1. The crypto market is young and volatile. 2. Moore's law in regards to mining hardware. It's possible that in 1 year 5000 GH/s will earn you diddly squat. Same problem with buying an antminer, the s9's will likely be outdated within a matter of months.
I would recommend buying and holding a cryptocurrency. I've had 1000 % gains this year. If you really want to mine, build a pc and mine some alt coins. Computer parts have intrinsic value and can always be resold. Plus building a pc is fun and a good skill to have! Also great if you're a gamer!
My rig cost me about 3k and earns me $20 per day less electricity cost. I just hit my ROI at the end of November. Still, I wish I had put that 3k into bitcoin instead because it would be worth about 8k today.
Hindsight is 20/20. Whatever you do, I wish you the best of luck.

That's rough, but you shouldn't beat yourself up for it. There is no way you could have known. Life is full of opportunities to find success and wealth, whether tangible or intangible. Trains are leaving all the time. Perhaps yours is still at the station!
In the mean time, buy some crypto! The best time to buy was yesterday, the second best is today.
Good luck to you!

Me too brother! HODL strong

Welcome to the party!
Don't get lost down the rabbit hole of crypto. Keep your college courses on your mind and your head in those books.
Good luck!

The universe has been expanding and cooling since the big bang. As far as humans know, it will continue to do so until life is no longer be possible. 
Cold death :D

Your truth. I disagree respectfully

Couldn't a quantum computer theoretically access those coins?

Right. 51% attack could censor transactions or double spend but that's about it

Crypto is already useful for individuals living in nations going through hyperinflation.
Focus on fundamentals, not price. Bitcoin is neutral, open, borderless, and censorship resistant.
