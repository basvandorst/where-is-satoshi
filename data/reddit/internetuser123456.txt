bitcoin is done
@_date: 2018-03-27 02:57:23
I'm gonna call it. BTC is officially dead guys.
@_date: 2018-03-19 21:37:36
A lot of resistance at the 8500 mark.
@_date: 2018-03-18 20:14:28
"the dip". Wait til tether implodes.
@_date: 2018-03-30 23:26:50
If that news was significant the price would have already gone up.
@_date: 2018-03-31 02:27:15
I hope your friend knows the price won't ever go up that high again. Ever.
@_date: 2018-03-29 20:03:09
Actually the true value of bitcoin is closer to zero.

@_date: 2018-03-22 19:16:55
if i could give you a million downvotes i would
@_date: 2018-03-21 04:25:06
It's going up boys
@_date: 2018-03-12 23:06:14
You guys keep swearing Asia is the problem when the sell-offs always happen during America’s daytime. Every single day. Asia is not the problem, they typically almost always hold. It’s you guys that are the problem. 
@_date: 2018-03-17 17:15:15
Feels like it's never coming back up.
@_date: 2018-03-06 01:30:24
you sound mad and i agree you are a little bitch
@_date: 2018-03-29 04:15:25
It's finally over guys. Bitcoin is done
@_date: 2018-03-14 16:23:58
@_date: 2018-03-28 19:01:22
a small percentage of investors have more than one coin
@_date: 2018-03-29 20:01:21
Taking previous increases from cents to hundreds and applying the same increases in the thousands. Sure, bud.
@_date: 2018-03-25 21:24:25
aaand it's gone
@_date: 2018-03-30 18:24:55
we will never see 11k again
@_date: 2018-03-31 03:08:03
7k to start the weekend. lol.
@_date: 2018-03-30 01:32:31
No one is buying at 6700. Take a wild guess whether it's going up or down from here.
@_date: 2018-03-27 20:19:09
bitcoin is finished
@_date: 2018-03-19 00:02:14
He thinks he's about to make it.
@_date: 2018-03-30 23:01:33
it’s not going back to 11k this time. We are headed to 2015 prices. I hope most of you hodlers know that bitcoin is much more likely to be worth $1 than $100k. Call it fud and downvote if you want. It’s the truth and I understand you can’t handle it.
@_date: 2018-04-03 03:00:04
Oh look another 200 dollar pump followed by 24 hours of sideways/bleeding. Boring as fuck.
@_date: 2018-04-03 03:24:10
It's worthy of being shitted on over and over. It's just a dumpster speculative non-existent "asset" that people only put money into to try and sell for more. That's ALL bitcoin is. Don't like my opinion? Then fuck you. It's just my opinion.
@_date: 2018-04-03 07:17:44
It is going to bleed out slowly from here all the way down. I mean all the way. It won't ever go back up to 16k. That kind of price was way overextended with many crazed noobs throwing in their savings and money they acquired on credit. It has all been shot down with regulations, taxes, bans, scams, you name it. That kind of undeserved hype will never happen again.
@_date: 2018-04-01 22:36:13
I wonder how confident you hodlers will be when the price starts showing in the 4000s.
@_date: 2018-04-03 01:44:59
Fuck bitcoin
@_date: 2018-04-02 00:49:49
This is nothing it will go away within 30 minutes.
@_date: 2018-04-04 15:41:23
failing to break 7k about ten times. pathetic.
@_date: 2018-04-03 07:07:07


Holy shit are you a genius?
@_date: 2018-04-03 02:14:59
You're damn right we are. Interest in bitcoin is long fucking dead.
@_date: 2018-04-01 21:25:56
where did you come up with this 55%? source?
@_date: 2018-04-03 03:27:01
Oh no I'm so scared. 
@_date: 2018-04-03 07:06:08
Can't even be bothered to read this pointless wall of text.
@_date: 2018-04-03 07:00:39
Another guy who looks at increases from pennies to hundreds and believes a proportionate increase will happen in the thousands.
@_date: 2018-04-04 18:35:53
if you think this has a happy ending, you haven't been paying attention
@_date: 2018-04-03 02:37:33
lmao
