I think it's an issue of semantics. If you read "lead developer" somewhere, it was probably by way of a journalist who was conflating "prominent" with "lead developer." Technically, Hearn was a lead developer of the bitcoin 'related' software  that he created, but not 'Bitcoin' itself, which is a discrete piece of technology in its own right. Either way, the popularity of his standalone app does qualify him as being "prominent" as a technical operator in the development of the overall field of bitcoin.

Use a major bank for non-bitcoin related stuff, use a small bullshit bank for bitcoin related stuff... they won't be as vigilant.

You separate a life support system from its host. The host dies. The life support system is still functional. The life support system can be attached to something else. In this case:
