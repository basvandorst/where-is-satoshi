@_date: 2018-01-13 00:34:26
Not sure what you are smoking, but an incredible amount of people disagree with you.
Another comparison we could do is Apple vs Android phones. 
There is no doubt that there is a higher premium on the Apple phones, but they offer simplicity and they are easier to use for most people. 
If you're an advanced user then you might get more out of an Android than an Apple. 
But if you're an expert then it doesn't matter - then you get everything you need no matter what you use.
Gemini and Coinbase are two different things. Gemini and GDAX are the ones you should compare. When it comes to a straight up brokerage site there is no comparison to Coinbase.

That, but I tend to like him as well. He has been very clear about disliking the direction of the development bitcoin has had the last few years - and that's fine. Nothing wrong with some disagreement. But people believes he want's to crush bitcoin, but to be honest it seems like he just dropped it and has now moved on to ETH.

Coinbase are here to make money. Segwit is not important for a service like them in that aspect. You could even say high fees makes sure people stay within the Coinbase ecosystem for trading and what not - which they make a even more money on.

I'm talking about you, How was Roger Ver wrong regarding what he said in your video?
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:25:27


Mainly because they are -very- similar. Such as:
1. Several of it's supporters claim it is "the real bitcoin"
2. It's called "*Bitcoin* Cash", which opens the question of what the difference is between them.
3. It forked from Bitcoin 5 months ago, which ensured everyone who had BTC at the time had BCH as well.
4. It forked because the community was divided in two camps, and had been for a long time, and the issue was related to block size. Other than the blocksize and difficulty adjustment settings the two chains were identical at the time of the fork. And the two camps both had the coin they wanted.
And you and me are having a discussion regarding your hypothesis compared BCH and BTC: 


You really do not want to say that BCH is is faster than BTC it seems, as you keep digging up every other tool except BTC to compare with. But from what I gather the original comment you gave is therefore wrong. If I am wrong then I just want to learn.
I own both coins, but my majority is in BTC. To get so riled up about a different coin as it seems you do is just mind boggling to me. It doesn't affect you one bit that it exists. It just has some properties that BTC does not so that people who want that functionality can use it, and the ones who want to use BTC can use BTC. BCH is far from the perfect coin, but neither is BTC. And neither is LTC, cash, bankpas(*?*) or mobile(*??*).

You actually believe Coinbase want to destroy BTC when it is their main source of income? Are you delusional? 
...oh. Right.
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:15:03
It becomes a prioritization issue. Either focus on making the user experience better for transactions or mining.


The main reason for spamming the network is to create delays for normal users because when a block is full you'll have to wait 10 minutes and hope you'll be included in the next one. With bigger blocks the spammers need to pay more fees to achieve this. 


If the discussion is between 1 MB and 8 MB it'll be fairly easy to spam it. But if the block size is 1 GB it'll be a costly affair. 
But *if* someone decides to spam several 1 GB blocks full with low-fee transactions then the blockchain size could grow to an incredible size.
Does this happen often though?

I've seen that one actually - it's a good speech.
Bigger blocks does not grow the blockchain. Amount of transactions grows the blockchain. A bigger block only gives more transactions per block. 
If we get more transactions it means more people are using the blockchain. If you are in favor of big or small blocks I think we all want mass adoption of bitcoin.

Yes, but that's exactly what they said more or less. The fees are too high so no one is using it. Steam gets their money either way, so it's just one less supplier (Bitpay) they need to deal with.

Might be some circular arguments in there, but it came from Bitcoin, so the comparison is fair. You're the one who compared them, so I guess you should tell us why you did so.
Attacks only makes a coin stronger, or it dies and is replaced by a stronger coin. There is money involved. Attacks will always come from everywhere.
You think hackers are outside the community?
But back to the question at hand: Is BCH a quicker coin than BTC?
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:14:34
He's been pretty open about how the reluctance of a block size increase from Core broke his heart, and how he went towards Ethereum instead because of it. If he likes BCH better than BTC then he is free to do so.
Full disclosure: I see his point.

No, what it means is that bubbles are neutral. 
A bubble is when price strongly exceeds the asset's intrinsic value - meaning the value when you disregard market value. Your house intrinsic value is the value of the dirt it stands on, and the cost of the materials that make up your house. Location is not part of that value. So it is completely neutral. The housing bubble that we all probably remember came about when there were too many buildings for people to live in and not enough people to pay the loans to pay for those houses. A market correction was needed. 
A bubble is not going to hurt, but a bubble that bursts will hurt. So maybe you should just look at corrections. We see small corrections all the time. A bubble that bursts is just a big correction. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 18:12:58
So what you're trying to say is that at the root of it all *we* have value? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:33:12
Bitcoin is the original coin. It has the biggest market share by far. This is the big boss of the crypto world.
The big boss has become so popular that it doesn't quite live up to the glory it showed in the good old days. It is -very- expensive to use per transaction, and it is very slow. But these things are temporary and can probably be solved with existing solutions if people actually used them.
Bitcoin Cash was made by people who were impatient. They did not want to pay large fees and wait for confirmations. So they made a small adjustment to the code and launched it. It has taken a very large market share compared to other cryptocurrencies on the market, but it does not come even close to Bitcoin.
As of today, for actually using cryptocurrencies and doing several transactions per day then Bitcoin Cash is a much better option. But Bitcoin has such a large market share and is the coin that is known by most people and is currently most likely to explode into mainstream use. If that happens then the market value will once again increase by tremendous amounts. But it is basically not usable as of today.
I would buy both, and then trade them against each other.

But how is that bad? PEople actually adopting the technology is great.
But are you really holding back due to network congestion and high fees, or are you holding to HODL? If you are in the ~~former~~ latter and most people are then we would not see an increase in transaction volume. It would be whatever BTC has and what BCH has. 
edit: wrong word. Meant latter.

If it was true then keeping the block size at the current level is hurting adoption much more than anything else at this point. I don't believe for a second that the usage of BTC would increase much more than the total transaction volume that BCH and BTC has combined currently.

@_date: 2018-05-03 19:37:10
An economic bubble or asset bubble is trade in an asset at a price or price range that strongly exceeds the asset's intrinsic value. It could also be described as a situation in which asset prices appear to be based on implausible or inconsistent views about the future. Asset bubbles date back as far as the 1600s and are now widely regarded as a recurrent feature of modern economic history.
Key words are "intrinsic value". How do we define something like that? As maturely pointed out; if people stop seeing it as having intrinsic value it has no value. Like fiat, gold or sea shells.. 
We are only told about bubbles when they burst, so we naturally consider them as a bad thing. But it is only a bubble that bursts that is a bad thing - a bubble in itself is a beautiful thing. 
Bubble is a silly word really. 
It's about faith. As long as we have faith it is all good. And all of us here tend to have faith in cryptocurrency as having value. Most people have faith in central banks and fiat. 
Some say the faith we put in future income through loans is how "the west" got such an economic dominant role in the world. Suddenly we could create money that was not there and so on. 
But it was all a bubble than has yet to really burst.

It's useless because it has no use. You can't make jewelry out of Bitcoin. You can't use it for producing electrical components. You can only store it.
I am very happy I've put money into Bitcoin, but if it doesn't manage to deal with transaction costs and time it will not be able to become mass adopted by your mother and my grandfather. Currently you can save a few days by using Bitcoin to get good ROI and occasionally siphon some of the returns through ShapeShift to get a fictional coin. But that isn't a desired solution.

You're in the store-of-value camp. Sure - it can absolutely be the future. 
But very few people actually invest in gold today, so if we only go for SOV then we won't see as big of a mass adoption as if it works as a currency - which much more people use. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 14:18:34
But if you look at cryptocurrency as a whole it is much more decentralized and with much more people controlling the direction. Certain people might control Bitcoin, but other people control Bitcoin Cash, while someone else controls Ethereum. With services such as shapeshift the whole market can be seen as one coin in a way. 
Note that this does not really apply to HODLing.
@_date: 2017-11-10 12:21:08
Sarcasm isn't helpful in this discussion. Are we supposed to be enemies? I thought we were all here trying to make bitcoin a good thing for the world and make some money while we're at it? Why don't you jump on the team and come on in for the big win? 
The point is that gold has a slightly more use than what a store-of-value-only cryptocurrency has. Is that what we want or need? I'm loving the ROI, but I am convinced it hurts us in the long run.

Only if Android had an initial mission, set forth by some unknown creator, that a lot of people were convinced was a good mission, that Google had deviated from.
Then at least Huawei would have a sound argument for their case. You can disagree that the initial mission was the best one, and conclude that evolution is a good thing though.

Well, I'm slow - so what do you mean when saying bitcoin.com is committing fraud?
@_date: 2017-11-21 00:29:13
It's a bitcoin wallet and a bitcoin cash wallet.
I don't like the attempt at saying BCH = BTC that he is pushing, but this wallet thing is so silly. They have supported BCH for quite some time now, but instead of manually adding a BCH-wallet (which is basically a one button operation) it is now already done when you download it. 
But this in addition to normal BTC.

They rooted for booting Core - not getting 2X. When it didn't work they don't care. 
That sub is mostly concerned with BCH in case you did not know. And they are mostly concerned with BCH because they feel Core has an approach to BTC that they did not agree on.

What's the equation and variables you use to define specifically what the price of Bitcoin should be?
It's difficult, right? Do you use any other way than the price being just what others are willing to buy for?
There is no underlying intrinsic value to bitcoin, so it's just increasing on a daily basis as there are limited amounts available and a lot of people willing to buy. 
But we're early adopters. Bubblemania will come. But if shops and so on isn't around to spend bitcoin in then we might get into trouble if a big bunch of people conclude that they can't really use Bitcoin for anything. Then we get into "the bigger fool" situation for a while, or the price tanks and we have people losing their investment.
@_date: 2017-11-20 10:59:05
You're not wrong. Specific fiats, such as the ones you listed, do burst. 
The Fiat-system as a whole is not likely to burst anytime soon. But it *could* happen. It has the ability to do so. Just like Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 18:50:20
Let's say that I know for a fact that 10 major whales will sell off all their BTC today, and then buy BCH again tomorrow. When the whales dump their BTC they'll move the price downward. Suddenly there is an enormous amount of BTC available. If other people want to sell their BTC they'll need to sell it cheaper than the whales do. And then the whales will have to decrease their selling price, and as this keeps going the price of BTC tanks. And likewise with BCH... people will start to buy it, because they know for a fact that it's cheaper today than tomorrow. They can just buy it today and sell it tomorrow when they can buy cheap BTC as it has already collapsed from today's havoc.
So if I add the information the app the price of BTC will tank. Everyone will lose money. And most likely the whales will stop their plan before it even happens.
How is any of this a good idea?

You believe more people will start mining? It's only getting more and more difficult to mine. Also expensive. And for every antminer you buy you'll support the big miners with more money making them able to buy more miners which increases the difficulty further.
The miners are a very important group in this ecosystem, but I don't see how there will be more people involved in this mining gig in the future.

Why is he most likely unintelligent?
All people should try to stay away from personal attacks. He managed to see Bitcoin as something good long before most people. He built a successful company. He left the dumpster fire that is the US for whatever reason. You are absolutely allowed to dislike people and disagree with them, but calling people unintelligent just seems uncalled for. And even if he is he has done good things for Bitcoin.
I find it difficult to like him at times as well, and the interview does not paint a good picture of him, but I believe we are better than what I see here in this post. There are other interviews where he seems like a normal, decent guy. The LA-one from a few days ago for example.
@_date: 2017-11-13 16:10:20
How is it that miners have more control than developers with BCH? 
And let's say they do in fact give miners bigger rewards. Wouldn't that lower the price of BCH and then remove the reward that way? 
If the reward is 10 or 20 coins per block will affect the price somehow, so it sort of takes care of itself the way I see it. 
Or do I misunderstand something here?
@_date: 2017-11-20 16:12:49

I agree that BCH will never become BTC, but it's easy to see that the argument that BCH is closer to the white paper than BTC currently is.
If people see the white paper as gospel then their claim that BCH is the real Bitcoin makes sense. It's okay to have different opinions about what is best. I spread no hate here. 
I don't consider the white paper as gospel though, and even if I did have some convictions at some point that BCH might go places I'm now fairly convinced it's never-bitcoin and should be dumped.

I agree with your first paragraph. Gold has more use than bitcoin. My question is if we want bitcoin to only be a store of value. 
As for gold only being popular for jewelry because it's so valuable... that's just wrong. There are other materials that are much more rare and more expensive than gold that isn't used much for jewelry. And there are plenty of people that can tell the difference between gold and a good fake. I might not be one of them, and I bet there aren't many on this website that does either. Gold used as jewelry has much more to do with culture and tradition than rarity and value. There are buckets of emotions related to jewelry. Not much logic at least.

How do I control who I am sending the change to?
If I send 0.48724111 BTC from my Coinbase account to you, but the transaction looks like the one above then it seems to me that Coinbase sent 0.5 BTC out, but split it into two batches, where you get yours, and the change (0.01208089) is sent to myself I suppose.
Is that's what is happening?

Do not forget that there is always a person behind the words you see on your screen. I don't want you anything bad in life. We are both here to do our best to make sure cryptocurrencies breaks the banks.
Did you download the wallet today?
From what I gather the Bitcoin.Com wallet has always been a BTC-wallet. You could *add* BCH as well in the settings. It was a button. It was set to "off" before and now it is set to "on".
So when you log into the wallet there are two wallets there:
1. Bitcoin.
2. Bitcoin Cash.
I don't quite see why you believe that is a scam and deserves attacking random people on the internet that tries to point out that people might make this into a bigger thing than it actually is.

BTC went up quite substantially in 2013, then fell - hard. It was then super stable for years. Then we had the latest boom in 2017. Same thing. It'll probably fall more and just be dormant for a few years. The difference this time around is that some other coin might take bitcoins place as market cap leader - whatever that means.

@_date: 2018-02-06 13:11:03
It makes sense to use it when you need a database but want to remove the need for a middleman you have to trust. So shipping containers full of things handled by several different people/companies can be placed into a common supply chain which then keeps track of ownership and so on.
But I agree that several companies have put "blockchain" on their databases and believe they'll create value of that somehow - and that is indeed useless.

I am looking forward to the web-app. When setting up my portfolio it is easier to do from a computer than on a phone. In my opinion at least - I'm probably old.
And for the pro version: I don't quite see the benefit. And the cost is too high for what it gives. You might also have done some market research, but in my opinion I would prefer giving you a one-time fee which is higher compared to a lower monthly fee.

There were two initiatives going on at the same time.
One was Bitcoin Cash, while the other was "SegWit2x". 
SegWit2x was a two-phased (*heh*) initiative. First "segregated witness" (segwit) was to be implemented. Then blocksize was to be doubled. Segwit was implemented, but the doubling of blocksize never happened. There was a lot of drama.
But the BCH-people considered segwit a poor solution. They therefore forked before segwit was implemented.

You're talking about a whole range of things which is irrelevant to our current discussion. 
My point is that december showed us that bitcoin in it's current form does not handle the transactions it needs in busy times. If we get more users it will get even worse. 
This is why there is such a focus on lightning. It will most likely alleviate the problems we saw in december. Just like 2x would have helped.

Your comprehension skills are also poor, but that is not the point.
The point is not your knowledge about Russia.
The point is that saying a country doesn't deserve the land it has is a silly things to say. Anyone saying such a thing obviously isn't someone who should be taken seriously on the matter. Which is why I said I feel the same way about the US - to show exactly that, and that I obviously shouldn't be taken seriously - just like he shouldn't.

I'm by no means the worst proponent of LN, but I don't like it. It feels like a bad solution. So convincing people like me will take some time. And some will taken even longer. So I agree. 2018 might be a start, but mass adoption is not now.
@_date: 2018-04-14 13:57:02
I never said such a thing, and it's sad to see you need to put words in my mouth to have any sort of valid argument. Saying Russia is vodka, depression and suicide is like saying the US is xanax, guns and school shootings. Your ignorance is incredible.
I don't prefer Russia over the US. They're both crappy places to live - except for a small minority of the people. Why you believe one has to be good is beyond me. The amount of racism, sexism and inequality a country can manage to create, yet still make its citizens believe it's the greatest country on earth is a testament to how impeccable the propaganda machine that you call the media is. The fact that it seems absurd to you that there might even be a grain of truth in what an outsider is telling you *should* in itself be a red flag.

I don't think that's true. Yes, a lot of supporters scream loud, but the same is true on this side of the coin. I treat the two coins equally. BCH has certain things I prefer over BTC, but the whole marketing issue many of them are on about regarding what is the "real" bitcoin is a bit silly in my opinion.
