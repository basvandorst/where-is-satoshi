this video doesnt fully cover it, but there isnt enough computing power for BTC to act as currency

@_date: 2018-08-26 20:24:19
Agreed, but it sucks for those using it

i know its naive to put a specific monetary value on a prediction, but i think he has some very good insight 
@_date: 2018-07-26 23:24:33
wise wise words, my friend. I completely agree. Thank you
@_date: 2018-07-26 23:41:43
I agree. Not worth going in head deep, but atlewst up to ur knees

i don't disagree, but if a select few were trillionaires, that cannot be good for anyone

I don't disagree. It is always suspicious when so many big name people get behind something. Its just risky daytrading. Id say holding (temporarily) is a good strategy for wary investors.

I completely agree. Some people have hundreds of thousands though from early day mining. Would they be trillionaires and if so, how would that not offset the market?

yeah but my friend, not some random guy but actually someone I am close with, has genuinely increased his sum. The issue is that he keeps reinvesting. He actually gets additional BTC in his cryptowallet, but he sends it back to reinvest when he wants to.

if you were in the situation would u pull out immediately or ride it for a little then pull out with some gains (and definitely some risk)
