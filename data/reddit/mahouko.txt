If you're in the USA try bitFlyer, Japan's biggest exchange. They recently opened up here and they support SegWit.
Spez - I am in no way affiliated with bitFlyer. If you see me pushing them a lot lately, it's because they support SegWit :)

Like I said, they're the biggest exchange in Japan, which is probably one of the most Bitcoin friendly places on the planet. 
I've deposited dollars &amp; BTC, but have withdrawn only BTC thus far. I don't really see myself making too many fiat withdrawals as I'm very bullish on BTC throughout the rest of 2018. Being that they've implemented SegWit, I'm pretty confident and have thus far not run into any problems with them.
Oh and bitFlyer is more like coinbase's exchange gdax, so there isn't going to be a 'hold the users hand' approach like there is with coinbase, but you'll save on fees and I sincerely doubt there will be any kind of fuckery comparable to what coinbase has done over the past few years.

Demonization started a long time ago imo and this nonsense now is what happens when they run out of arguments. The irony is that the same paper with "Democracy dies in darkness" at the top of its pages, is 'trying' to accomplish just that.
Instead of last year's repetitive cycle of muh tax returns, muh Russia, muh mental health, muh racism on a different target, we begin a repetitive cycle attacking Bitcoin consisting of muh bigger blocks needed, muh transactions too slow, muh it uses too much energy and kills the planet, muh racism.

Wow lol. I just finished reading all of your replies and all I can say about that individual is people don't know what they don't know. It's a little sad, but at the same  time I'm beginning to think this may be the natural course of things when a new paradigm shift begins to become more mainstream.
I honestly wouldn't be surprised if we see big blockers become even more irrational and start referring to us as something not unlike the Russian hysteria that's going on in an entirely different ecosystem. Think about all of the "Bitcoin is bad for the environment" stories that were spammed in this sub in the week leading up to bch being listed on coinbase. To us it's just FUD, but this other group of people may actually believe this.
Facts vs feelings? Maybe, but I just started conceptualizing this idea last night.
On a good note, I want to add that the battle that's currently happening will have at least one very positive effect. It will lead to Bitcoin becoming even more anti-fragile :)
@_date: 2017-12-31 02:13:57
I swear there were quite a few mentions of it a week ago or so, but we were still going through euphoria and it was probably missed by most. I also wasn't able to confirm there was Segwit support until ~72 hours ago.

You need A LOT of support to make changes to Bitcoin, whether it be soft or hard forking.
Big blockers tried to get consensus back in July/August and failed to do so, which is why we now have Segwit. Segwit reached consensus.
As for energy? I personally could not care less and good luck getting 95% consensus on any kind of changes related too Bitcoi's energy demand 'anytime soon' lol
Edit - You say there's a big argument to be made on the amount of energy used, so make the argument. Simply stating there's an argument to be made without providing an actually argument is not an argument.

It would be safer to simply laminate the sheet of paper with your seed on it to protect from water damage and then put it in a fireproof lockbox. You may also want to create a passphrase , even an easy &amp; simple one you'd never forget. This way no one could use the seed if found without knowing said passphrase.
@_date: 2019-11-29 07:31:23
@_date: 2019-03-07 01:31:26
Correct. The only thing I'd add to my list above would be possibly keeping a second laminated copy in an additional fireproof lockbox at a separate location. 
Edit - One can also place their word list(s) inside a sealed security envelope prior to putting them into the fireproof lockbox. This way you'll know no one has tampered with or seen the seed.

Ledger has the best development **imo**. I was originally going to buy a Trezor, but I like how the nano s looks like nothing more than a thumb drive aka much less suspicious. The only possible con with the ledger, though it's not a con in my opinion, would be that it uses a secure element.

Referencing your edit 2, Andreas has commented on this many times echoing much of what's been said here already. 
While it's not "fair" as you like to put it, his opinion is along the lines of it being much more fair, because people who own Bitcoin have taken an enormous risk on an untested technology based on a vision they had, rather than because "your grandfather killed more people than someone else's grandfather".

This story is a mischaracterization of what he actually said and I'm sure it would be easy to find a video of it via YouTube.
He said that he's open to the possibility of weak dollar, but went on to say that he's also not opposed to a strong dollar. Needless to say, Treasury secretaries have historically given lip service to questions about this and didn't comment what they were actually thinking, but leave it to the media to take advantage and misrepresent what was actually said.

I'm probably the exception, but I've never owned an iPhone and actually took my first profit about two weeks ago so I could buy one of these.

Okay I mixed up deposit and withdrawal above. You can buy and sell BTC with a debit card or a linked bank account. You can also send/receive BTC to and from other cash app users. Lastly, you can withdrawal from your cash app wallet to your l any other wallet external of cash app, but you cannot deposit BTC from an external wallet into your cash app.

Don't other coins handle this better?
No, because nothing else has even come close to hitting similar throughput.
If so is this something that can improve?
What do you think SegWit is? Bitcoin is continually being improved via consensus. Some see this as a weakness, but nothing could be further from the truth.
If not, does this mean that it will render useless?

2x will not be implemented :)

Not only will it be peaceful, but it also will not happen

I'm in agreement with you, but on the other hand Trump's SEC pick was sworn in yesterday.

Fake news

Them posting this BS is fine as it only makes Bitcoin become even more antifragile. Moreover, after all this nonsense we're still sitting at 5800 which is bullish imo.

I believe maximum purchase is $10k per week. Daily withdraws 2k, weekly withdraws 5k.
If you really plan to buy a whole coin and have the ability to ach/wire money to an exchange, I'd probably do that instead as a way around all fees. If however, you need the transaction done asap or need to use a debit card, the cash app would be the way to go imo.

You write down your recovery phrase on paper, then use that if you ever need to recover or change wallets. 
@_date: 2019-05-08 15:31:07
Indeed. The only downside with cash app, and I personally don't find this to be a negative, is that you currently cannot deposit Bitcoin.

Things are changing 
And it's being done as we speak with BTCPayserver
@_date: 2019-05-08 15:27:09
Yes, they can be withdrawn, provided you give them the required info.
@_date: 2019-05-08 02:24:41
You cannot withdrawal your Bitcoin on RobinHood. They don't offer this. 
You can try Coinbase, however I'd personally go with Square's Cash App or Gemini.

BTCPayserver is a Bitcoin payment processor which has no intermediator. The user is the payment processor :)

One cannot buy Bitcoin on Robinhood. What you purchase will not truly be yours.
@_date: 2018-12-27 17:38:16
In developed nations perhaps, but not worldwide.
@_date: 2019-05-08 02:26:10
Coins cannot be withdrawn from RobinHood.
@_date: 2019-05-13 18:53:16
Different story link but this makes me more optimistic.


@_date: 2018-12-17 06:43:28
I'm not saying things can't change, but it was never really debated nor was it even voted on in Committee, which is needed to get to the Senate floor to be debated. 
I'm afraid the article was click bait at the time.
@_date: 2018-12-31 07:53:35
No. Not your keys, not your Bitcoin
@_date: 2018-12-21 05:22:00
You're not wrong. I just get freaked out when I see people posting potentially malicious short cut methods while taking real solutions for granted and went a little crazy with my reply.
@_date: 2017-06-13 08:16:17
What backs gold?
@_date: 2018-12-31 22:09:59
Nice hallucination :)
One cannot withdrawal BTC from robin hood, meaning one can not really buy it from there.

@_date: 2018-12-15 07:29:33
They're just taking a longer, less efficient way of getting to Bitcoin. Gab added BTCPayserver a few days ago, Bitchute has mentioned they'll be doing the same....
Also worth noting is Notch stopped using Patreon a few nights ago and had this to add 
@_date: 2018-12-19 08:19:11
It would be very stupid, because even if there is a "government shutdown", it's for nonessential workers only. Misnomer.
@_date: 2017-06-18 11:15:06
Kawaii desu ne
@_date: 2018-12-21 04:35:58
Would love to see the their code considering this has already been achieved by Nicolas Dorier via BTCPayServer.
@_date: 2018-12-31 13:48:49
You can't withdrawal BTC from robin hood, meaning you're not really even buying it.
@_date: 2018-12-19 16:19:54
People are being deplatformed all over, for political things such as having "wrong think" as well as adult related content and everything in between. People are being censored and I'm beginning to see prominent people push for Bitcoin and some of them have even explained Bitcoin's uncensorable mechanism to their viewers.
That said, I'm sure there are many other contributing factors, but this one in particular has a lot of potential to move price upward.
@_date: 2018-12-19 08:15:30
More people are beginning to realize it's censorship resistant nature.
