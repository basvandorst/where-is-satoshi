You mean JP Morgan Chase the company that smuggles money for drug companies:

To be fair the fucker is a Russian asset and they would love nothing more go devalue the usd. The usd has major problems but Russia is not your friend here. They are a mafia state. You think the US is bad? At least we pretend to have the rule of law.

Long story.. I'm migrating away slowly.  No new accounts with them.  I don't want to migrate my CC account with them as it's my oldest card and credit age is one of the factors with credit score.  They will be gone soon enough.

Thanks mister absolutist.  Being a bit hyperbolic aren't we... 
"Life is a shipwreck.  Save what you can"
Being pragmatic can save you a lot of time and effort in the long term.

You're not paying for your money. You're paying for convenient access to your money. Aka cash.

Couple thoughts.. I know this has been discussed before (and for years) but why the fuck hasn't it been implemented by anyone yet?
I'm in a bad mood because I had about 5 damn spam phone calls in a row.

Can be resolved via a smart contract whereby if too many people complain you lose a bond.

A whitelist for your friends would work... 
But the caller could ask you to refund real quick via the app once it's legit.

The truth it's that it's better for volatility for it to happen now rather than later.
The longer we wait the bigger this will be an issue.... but in a way you're right.  Technically a wallet could ban older coins but I'm not expecting that to happen.

They are SHARDED keys plus I imagine they still have a passphrase.
You could have to get a quorum of the keys. It's not strictly required as they could use a multikey sig but they could also use forward error correction so they only need like 3/5ths of the keys to reconstruct.

It would just be an envelope with a sharded private key.
IANAL but I'm 95% certain it's not illegal.
Remember.  It's not the full key..  It's just 1/Nth of the key.  
I believe that storing money and securities in a safe deposit box IS illegal but  you don't actually have access to money / bitcoin here as you only have a fraction of the key.
Whether they change that law is anyone's guess.
I still find it insane that taking US currency out of circulation is a crime.

Interesting idea for smashing/destroying the computer/router/printer.
I would normally consider that a bit over the top but there's really no 100% certain way to know your keys aren't still in swap or nvram.

I agree that you're about 50% right.
I think the distinction I was trying to make is that if you split it up across banks and across US state boundaries it's going to be very hard to seize.
Remember.  These accounts could also be under the names of friends and family.
This wouldn't actually be illegal as they don't actually have possession of the funds.
But to your point it might be better to just bury some of the key shards in the ground somewhere :-P 
but even then if the keys have a passphrase that's memorized that's another solution.
You can use memory palace mnemonics to memorize huge keys.
My personal passphrases/passwords are all mnemonics of large pseudo-random keys.

Simol put. The United States would not exist without the help of the French.

This could have a long term correctly for the banking system.
If Bitcoin gives them actual competition they are going to have to push for reform.
The problems that caused the 2008 crisis still remain.

Well. Sanctions. I guess bitcoin can be used to bypass sanctions but also legitimate transactions could be monitored and we could still have laws making it illegal to trade. I guess cash is used to break the law too

That Warren Buffet was right.. *invest* in something of inherent value. Trying to make money on bitcoin is speculation at best.  
I believe in bitcoin too but I think it's better used as a currency.
We NEED a reliable price of bitcoin for it to function as a currency.  
I was about to purchase something large ($2k) with BTC and I'm holding off until the prices stabilize again.
This is hopefully good for the market.  The correction means that more kids won't be thinking this is free money.  
For bitcoin to reliably go up long term we need people to be using it for normal and boring things like your salary, or your mortgage.

It will become more obvious when there are vulnerabilities in the encryption algorithms on their keys yet they haven't been moved to new wallets.
The theory being Bitcoin will adapt before any vulnerabilities are developed and they will move away from ECC.
Once the vulnerabilities become practical people WILL attack the keys so if you left money there you're going to lose it :-P

With bitcoin what I'm interested in are old wallets being broken and the funds migrated. We know we have lost bitcoin and that this causes artifical inflation. It's not really theft either since these coins can't actually be spent
