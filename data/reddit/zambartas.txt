And furthermore there shall be no anonymous cash as well!

I'm totally new to this, but couldn't it be to drive the price down to buy coins cheap? 
 Maybe it's just to see if it can be done.

This is a kin to a gas station charging a higher price for credit compared to cash.  The credit card processor is going to take 3 percent of that $2.25, which is why some places will charge $2.35 for credit to recoup the loss.  They want cash payments because it's more money in their pocket, but they also don't want to miss out on that sale and be cash only.  You can look at it as being charged for using credit or a discount for using cash. The places that charge the same price for cash or credit have the fees built into the price so essentially you're not getting a break by paying cash anymore.

How long until Mark Zuckerberg steals their idea and makes it better?

People will down vote you simply because they don't agree with you or don't like what you said.  It's just a down vote, don't sweat it and don't let it change what you really want to say.

I think it's hard for them to justify the amount of resources required to handle the volume of transactions at a busy time like now for the rest of the week when there's much less activity and things run smoothly.  The bottom line is if they need to have more people on staff to handle these surges in activity you're going to see fees increase.  Think of a two lane highway that's only busy one hour each morning and night.  Does that justify spending millions of dollars and therefore increasing costs just to alleviate traffic during those 2 hours when the other 22 hours are fine?

Oh geez I wonder who stole my BTC.  Maybe it was that "friend" that suddenly ran off to Colorado and bought a Camaro.
I'm no legal expert but I think that's still a felony and very traceable if you're not smart about it.

I'm not saying they're wrong, just proposing a possible explanation.

Personally I have a few wallets and different seeds on paper for each, but none of them are for anything of value, just different wallets to transfer through.
The guy could be that dumb, but why of all places would you keep a 70btc seed in your wallet?  I don't nearly have that kinda money but if I did you can bet it would be spread around and not have the seeds kept in some place where it can be stolen lost or destroyed.

Why did you buy BTC?  To invest?  Then do nothing, sit and watch the price occasionally and buy more when you can.  If you bought it to spend now you might want to use another wallet that you control without a web service.  Honestly though you should have another wallet anyway, just a question of how much money you want to keep in each place.  Everyone here has their own preference you'll have to research and find out what works best for you but I like the simplicity and security of Mycelium.

I understand your complaints but I don't think Coinbase is trying to be the equivalent of a stock trading app/site.  I personally keep most of my coins in the vault and that would take days to liquidate, there must be a better place more geared towards quicker "trading" but I'm guessing anywhere you go would be having issues when the price goes crazy.
@_date: 2017-05-26 22:39:26
I totally agree except that I'm ever so tempted to sell off a little bit so I can buy it back cheaper later.  Haven't done it but with the way the price has been so predictable lately someone who pays more attention that myself certainly should be able to take advantage.

The answer to this should almost always be... and I have slightly more or less money than I did last week.

Exactly.  The more thinking you take out of the equation the dumber things people do.  That's why people with virus scanners don't think twice about downloading and running everything.  You're much better off just being educated and aware when it comes to computers and technology than relying on everyone else to protect you.  
Fuck you Google, help us find everything but only what we want not everything else.

Exactly.  So sick of the 'Coinbase cost me money' posts from the wall street wannabes.
