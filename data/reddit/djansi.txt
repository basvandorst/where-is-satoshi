I am just getting a cloudflare page, I guess they got too much traffic.

The bank may have acted properly, you just happened to do exactly what a criminal trying to steal your $500 would do. You could probably clear that up pretty quickly. The banks only get suspicious of you when you convert bitcoin to fiat and start making a lot of deposits.

But they also want to verify your ID to be KYC/AML compliant, that would make it obvious that you are in the US.

However they previously stated that the new site will not do business with US customers. It's all a bit confusing right now.

Bitcoin is still up $100 for the week, which is a great week in my opinion!

Looks like small test transactions

I don't see how anyone could trust them at this point. If they came back up and force users to verify IDs, they may be able to retain some of their coins.

...and it's back up to the maintenance page. BTC-e is still breathing
edit: site is going up and down
