Well unless bitcoin goes down to 0 i won't lose it will I 
@_date: 2017-08-30 17:55:47
Yeah I did it as soon as I bought it. Its in my electrum 
@_date: 2017-08-30 10:52:58
Yea that's right maybe that's where people go wrong buying after a massive spike and seeing it go down is disappointing. I'll try keep my mind of it. Thanks
@_date: 2017-08-31 18:51:46
Congratulations and good luck. It feels like we are late but people are saying we are relatively early so let's just hope that bitcoin exceeds
@_date: 2017-08-31 08:21:05
Yeah I did the same and bought some yesterday i have like 13 mbtc at the moment. The only problem is it just  feels like it's low risk / low reward. I'll add more  money though
@_date: 2017-08-30 10:45:59
Yea all the stories are I bought 100 and it went down to 70 and I sold them. Or the other way around. Thanks I'll hold
@_date: 2017-08-31 20:19:19
Tattoo your seed on your ass cheek 
@_date: 2017-08-31 09:35:58
When all else fails buy csgo keys and add kubop btc to key steam bot
@_date: 2017-08-30 15:03:10
Well that's hard to say because I know I won't lose it. What is a sensible amount. I'm under 18 do I have no responsibility.
@_date: 2017-08-30 14:17:49
Also why do people recommend not checking up on your price often
@_date: 2017-08-30 11:07:31
Yea man good luck if I knew it would dip would of bought it then but whatever
@_date: 2017-08-31 21:15:40
Is everyone 16 years old all of a sudden 
@_date: 2017-08-31 19:30:06
Local bitcoins. Some people don't require ID. Coincorner let's you buy £100 worth of btc before you verify your identity
@_date: 2017-08-30 11:41:00
What do you mean.  Noob question but what is a paper wallet 
@_date: 2017-08-31 09:44:11
Ok nice gl
@_date: 2017-08-30 10:52:00
You see the first bit is true if you keep calling it $50 that's all it'll ever be. And yea your right would of spent it on some dumb shit anyway thanks
@_date: 2017-08-31 09:35:16
It's gonna be worth 10k a lot sooner
@_date: 2017-08-31 13:55:23
Did you give yourself gold?
@_date: 2017-08-31 14:21:51
I thought you were talking about piano lessons
@_date: 2017-08-30 18:01:33
Lol thanks bro 
@_date: 2017-08-30 11:48:48
Yea that smart I just keep mine is electrum. If I were you I would do the same though
@_date: 2017-08-30 18:23:41
Well that's good to hear. I feel like me only investing £50 is pointless as it's such a small amount but I'll add more and more anyway
@_date: 2017-08-30 14:30:17
Well I have checked it 7 times today so I'll yo ahead and delete blockfolio
@_date: 2017-08-30 14:55:18
So how much Is a good amount to put in. I don't really have any source of income but it would be nice to make money from investing. It's like gambling but the odds are in your favour you just need to be patient 
@_date: 2017-08-30 12:34:55
@_date: 2017-08-30 12:58:49
Ah darn I only have 99. Down to the casino I guess
@_date: 2017-08-30 10:57:52
Bitcoin wasn't even on my mind today. But I saw thst roller coaster guy and his eyes man. His eyes made me do this
@_date: 2017-08-30 18:48:08
That's a good way to look at dips. I just want to understand bitcoin investment better. When people say hold you bitcoin.  What do they mean? How long are people planning on holding it?
@_date: 2017-08-30 19:13:44
Do people think when bitcoin eventually stabalizes it will be more than what it is now or a bit less
@_date: 2017-08-30 21:27:32
Eh it's just I feel like my investment is pointless. If bitcoin reaches a significant amount I don't make thst much
@_date: 2017-08-30 14:26:04
So when is it okay to check or rarely
@_date: 2017-08-31 15:00:55
Oh ok lol that's cool
@_date: 2017-08-30 18:59:01
If it's thst simple what puts off the average Joe from purchasing bitcoin. When I saw bitcoin hit 4k I kicked myself for spending the bitcoin I had for dumb shit. So I bought some and will buy more as time goes on. 
@_date: 2017-08-31 13:55:53

@_date: 2017-08-31 17:26:43
Don't keep them in an exchange and people get paper wallets because they are investing long term and don't want to risk anything 
@_date: 2017-08-01 13:06:19
@_date: 2017-08-01 13:06:20
@_date: 2017-08-30 19:10:04
So how often should I buy bitcoin? How much is a sensible amount to keep on my wallet and just forget about. Of course there is a 1/10000000 chance bitcoin crashes and I lose my money. But realistically it will go up and up in the next few months and years
@_date: 2017-08-30 14:40:16
How much do you have in your wallet? I don't understand how investing works I understand you are always making money but when do people decide to sell?
@_date: 2017-08-30 17:07:11
Yeah but I need to stop looking at the price. Need to get used to it. And I will definitely buy more thanks for your advice 
@_date: 2017-08-30 12:33:25
I said a lot but I really meant it was my first time investing anything. I just put it in there and I'm gonna leave it there for a few years
@_date: 2017-08-30 12:51:18
I'm 15 and just bought 11 mbtc (£50) today. Haven't made money but it already feels like a good decision 
@_date: 2017-08-30 12:39:51
I got less 47.50
@_date: 2017-08-30 17:27:16
Do you really believe it will reach 10k in a few months. I just got some btc and that would be a pretty good thought to keep in the back of my mind
@_date: 2017-08-30 14:36:58
Yeah that's right I'll try forget about it but I actively want to think about investing more at the same time
@_date: 2017-08-31 08:26:07
Yea I did this investment so I can just have some extra change in future 
@_date: 2017-08-30 11:29:35
Yeah I just hope this decision turns out to be a good one in thr long run how often do people usually check their wallet
@_date: 2017-08-31 13:56:46
@_date: 2017-08-30 19:14:12
Sorry for bombarding you with questions just wanna be up to date with what people think and predict 
@_date: 2017-08-31 20:00:02
They just hear the money and jump right in. I think once bitcoin dips slightly they will panic sell before you can say zoom 
@_date: 2017-08-30 11:17:29
No that's not really a worry lol. I'll only check my wallet when I see roller coaster guy
@_date: 2017-08-31 19:31:40
Well I might be wrong but it shouldn't need to confirm if you are buying something like coffee. And yea I have electrum on my phone just download it on the appstore and put in your seed
@_date: 2017-08-30 14:11:11
I haven't even made any money and I'm thinking about buying more. Once I catch up with how much I have in my bank I'll buy some more
@_date: 2017-08-30 15:06:09
Well I don't but the chances are really low. But I can see what you are saying. I'll probs throw another 20 and go from there
@_date: 2017-08-31 10:20:47
The site works as a middleman so yeah you are safe man
@_date: 2017-08-30 20:19:21
RemindMe! December 18 2017
@_date: 2017-08-30 15:16:14
If what now? If bitcoin doubled it will drop? What do you mean
@_date: 2017-09-02 11:10:45
I only have 0.0173562 in bitcoin how much are you looking to buy?
@_date: 2017-09-01 13:24:56
If bitcoin is pointless then so are other currencies. Pieces of paper and copper with no value
@_date: 2017-09-02 17:52:30
I was joking but you saying you bought bitcoin @ 750
@_date: 2017-09-04 12:09:29
Yea don't sell it now though
@_date: 2017-09-02 11:16:50
@_date: 2017-09-02 17:51:21
Size doesn't matter, but it does...
@_date: 2017-09-02 16:22:26
I know this is a joke but is pathetic people don't pay attention to anything useful. When reddit was invented I assure you cat videos weren't the idea.
@_date: 2017-09-02 11:29:45
Yeah ik especially with paypal and their shitty refunding lol the buyer always seems to win which is why exchanges don't accept it
@_date: 2017-09-02 11:20:32
@_date: 2017-09-02 11:05:59
You want to buy bitcoin? Or sell
@_date: 2017-09-02 11:30:11
I'll pm 1  sec
@_date: 2017-09-01 21:20:52
Yea right saw a post but didn't read it right then saw ur comment
@_date: 2017-09-01 11:23:03
That would be da best I think blockfolio has reminders but if I download it I know I'll always be checking it

@_date: 2017-09-03 17:50:44
@_date: 2017-09-05 12:38:27
Is that why you accidently disputed it when I asked for your address?  Haha too soon bro too soon 
@_date: 2017-09-05 11:08:54
Oh ok that makes sense

@_date: 2017-09-01 13:11:57
Sad bit is people saw thst kid who got free $50 and everyone wants it. Pretty pathetic. And did you say a toy? 
@_date: 2017-09-02 11:18:02
@_date: 2017-09-05 10:57:15
So that goes for buying a cup of coffee with it too?

@_date: 2017-09-02 10:58:18
Sell it to someone for paypal.  I have about $70 in paypal how much do u have
@_date: 2017-09-01 10:42:35
I'd personally just buy bitcoin and maybe 50 towards ETH so btc isn't always on my mind
@_date: 2017-09-03 20:10:06
Don't get it sent to coinbase get it sent to a wallet 
@_date: 2017-09-01 12:48:12
I got scared for a sec on my notification thought you were gonna say years. Seems like I chose a great time to invest then
@_date: 2017-09-02 08:57:04
They don't compare USD EUR GBP to any other currency. But yea I wanna know too

Spaceship 
@_date: 2017-09-01 19:47:53
Nope 
@_date: 2017-09-05 10:20:01
It says I have 0 even though I have $100
@_date: 2017-09-03 18:31:30
Pretty sure you can dispute those 
@_date: 2017-09-03 17:48:40
No that doesn't make sense
@_date: 2017-09-01 12:19:18
People like you are the reason people get put off bitcoin. With your get rich schemes tarnishing bitcoins name
@_date: 2017-09-05 11:05:36
But how does a computer determine if it's an asset or not? And that means holding it is the best way for it to grow in value?
@_date: 2017-09-02 08:55:03
@_date: 2017-09-02 19:32:14
@_date: 2017-09-01 19:22:02
I don't know what you mean
@_date: 2017-09-02 17:50:54
@_date: 2017-09-01 21:51:07
Local bitcoins is a good one. If you ever have a really hard time finding exchanges csgo keys are good
@_date: 2017-09-03 17:49:49
That wouldn't happen
@_date: 2017-09-01 10:19:51
Can anyone explain to me what could stop bitcoin doubling in price every 4 years. I know in theory it should work but what could get in the way of that.
@_date: 2017-09-04 12:01:56
Definitely wait. If I were you I would hodl a month more or something and get a yacht ����
@_date: 2017-09-01 21:02:58
Keeping bitcoin is wallet charges fees or am I retarded?
@_date: 2017-09-03 20:37:46
I'll pm you
@_date: 2017-09-01 11:21:29
Wake me up when it hits 7k
@_date: 2017-09-02 10:45:56
He means people expect bitcoin to be the future of currency. But right now people say bitcoin is worth x €£$. When €£$ crash/ don't exist what will we compare bitcoin too
@_date: 2017-09-03 17:50:31
I don't care someone is bound to be legit I'll make sure the send first no. Chance of getting scammed
