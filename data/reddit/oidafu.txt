I totally understand. Make a plan and stick to it. If USD/BTC drops $100 buy if that is your plan. I think they say "Don't try to catch a falling knife".
I buy regardless of what is happenig and spend some here and there. Working pretty well so far.

The addresses displayed are associated with your coinbase.com wallet. Any of those addresses can be used to receive bitcoin.

Sure I realize how hard double spends are. Most people don't, that's why they are running around talking about altcoins that have super fast block speeds are going to kill bitcoin.
Practically every individual dosn't need to download the full blockchain, and probably most business's either. I was just offering an example of when it might be prudent to do so. If I were walmart for example, I would run a full node and verify transactions against that node.

Money isn't about "community" and "feels", it's about taking care of business. I agree with you 100%.

Change is sent to a different address than the address you are spending from.
So, the use of change addresses that are different from the input addresses is a good thing from a privacy point of view. It is not perfect – people can still infer that you are the owner of the change address too – but it helps.
@_date: 2014-04-25 23:21:46
Thieving bastards!
This is why I always verify the first few and last few characters of the receiving address before sending it.
Edit: Thanks to all who clarified how this malware operates. I obviously underestimated it's cleverness.

If I were a business owner and dealing with a lot of bitcoin transactions, I would definitely run a well connected full node. I would verify transactions against  said node. Then I would accept zero confirmation transactions, otherwise customers might have to wait for a few confirmations before delivering the goods.

I requested a reset sometime last year and it took several days for it to happen. I was able to regain access before they reset it because I had a nandroid backup of my phone and was able to pull the 2FA keys from the backup.
Now I always make sure to email/download a backup from blockchain.info whenever I generate a new address.

In the post that linked to, why didn't you just ask the question "are there any faucets for bitcoin that are still operating"? Why did you even mention dogecoin? You begin your post with "Now, I know a lot of you don't like dogecoin and that is understandable, but I am coming from that community."
In the comments your replies are very passive aggressive.




You appear to be trolling.

I've used Coinbase for over a year. I had one order get canceled due to being "high risk". I emailed support and whitelisted my account and honored the transaction. I use coinbase weekly without issues.

Most people involved in Bitcoin see it as real money and not as "facebook likes" or a number of "twitter followers". I see a lot of 50-100 dogecoin tips and I think "Why bother making a reply and tip some dude a penny?" I don't stop and pick up a penny from the sidewalk when I see one because it's not worth the effort.
I suck at articulating my thoughts. I hope you understand my point and that this is in no way an attack on you personally, or dogecoin for that matter.
@_date: 2014-02-04 03:24:50
You said that already.


What are the other reasons?

It's 100% upgradable. As stated, it takes consensus to enact the upgrades. If the participants in the Bitcoin economy view any new upgrades/features as beneficial they will adopt the new software/clients and if not they will stick with the old or follow a fork.
Bitcoin will keep evolving to meet the needs of the market.

I tried to push the transaction through but I get "An outpoint is already spent [(109607643, 1), (109624486, 0), (99359288, 0)]"
This shows the error:
It basically says to be patient and wait a day or two... I would assume that Mt.Gox can't move bitcoin from cold storage fast enough to meet withdrawal demands and some people encounter this issue.

Credit cards were invented in the 1950's.  Diners Club, American Express and BankAmericard (Visa) introduced credit cards then.

Maybe we got of on the wrong foot. I was asking for an explanation as to how a smart phone would benefit a homeless person. It seems the wording of my reply caused you to become defensive and react with insults, and I responded in kind. We are better than this. I apologize.
I live in rural America and public libraries offer free access to the internet. Cheap pre-paid cell phones are readily available. If a homeless person needed a way for a prospective employer to contact them, I think this would be a viable way of doing so. There is still an issue of maintaining a charge, though. Maybe this isn't an issue where you are from, but around here there aren't many outlets accessible to just anyone.
If I knew a person in need who was already engaged in helping themselves, I would certainty help them if I could.
@_date: 2014-02-08 00:41:13
I don't understand what a homeless person is going to do with a smart phone. Mostly, how do they keep it charged? Are they going to Skype with their homeless friends? Get alerts on the best soup kitchen or flop house? 
If I were homeless, I think a smart phone would be pretty low on my priority list. If not, I might need to check into becoming homeless.
