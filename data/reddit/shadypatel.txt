@_date: 2017-10-14 23:01:11
How did you buy bitcoin under 18?
@_date: 2017-10-19 19:19:49
But it takes like 6 weeks to get back your investments
@_date: 2017-10-06 17:14:32
Which website did you buy them from?
@_date: 2017-10-08 15:46:14
Where should I buy?
@_date: 2017-10-06 16:16:00
Where do you buy them from? 
@_date: 2017-10-15 00:07:08
Ya I did. But it went away idk what happened. Like I was on CoinBase and bought $200 and nothing happened. 
@_date: 2017-10-15 02:29:25
@_date: 2017-10-15 14:14:48
Yes your right.
@_date: 2017-10-10 20:59:27
Where do you buy from? 
@_date: 2017-10-10 04:15:56
I got no idea man. 
@_date: 2017-10-08 15:44:01
How much should I buy?
@_date: 2017-10-06 14:33:10
How much did you buy? 
@_date: 2017-10-09 16:55:29
I have $3000 in my bank account but I don’t think it’s a good idea to put all of it in it. I make $150 a week from my job. 
@_date: 2017-10-10 22:54:52
I’m 17. I don’t know how to buy it. I was thinking on using my dads identification on CoinBase and buying Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-10 21:00:59
How much would I earn? Like a estimate.
@_date: 2017-10-06 19:41:50
Where can you do them at? 
@_date: 2017-10-06 16:16:48
Is Ethereum and Litecoin gonna skyrocket like bitcoin? 
@_date: 2017-10-06 16:30:11
How much did you buy? USD.
@_date: 2017-10-10 22:53:50
Why 4 weeks? ��
@_date: 2017-10-06 18:25:16
When do you think is the perfect time? 
@_date: 2017-10-06 16:54:57
Why? 
@_date: 2017-10-09 16:54:49
Is there any way to find out how much profit you can get? 
@_date: 2017-10-19 18:44:05
How much have you invested?
@_date: 2017-10-06 15:26:19
Is coinbase a good place to buy bitcoin? 
@_date: 2017-10-06 16:30:24
@_date: 2017-10-06 16:31:20
Lol. I been trying to use some HYIPs the last couple of days. Mostly all have been paying. 
@_date: 2017-10-10 03:22:40
I just closed my account because my account was restricted. 
@_date: 2017-10-09 01:22:11
Any tips? Or website to follow? 
@_date: 2017-10-06 16:01:45
True. 
@_date: 2017-10-06 18:47:39
@_date: 2017-10-06 16:16:23
Ya I wished I bought them a year ago!
@_date: 2017-10-09 16:54:27
So are there any fees? 
@_date: 2017-10-08 15:59:03
Your helpful! So where do you store the bitcoins you buy from CoinBase for example?
@_date: 2017-10-11 02:02:54
Ya I was going to ask them. 
@_date: 2017-10-06 19:21:26
What’s the return for those? 
@_date: 2017-10-06 16:16:08
Where do you buy them from? 
@_date: 2017-10-05 15:36:28
Why 
@_date: 2017-10-09 00:30:32
If I do $200 a month, would that be a good amount? 
@_date: 2017-10-07 02:36:56
I’m 17. Is age in issue? 
@_date: 2017-10-06 05:37:30
Where do you suggest to buy coins? 
@_date: 2017-10-10 03:23:01
How fast is Gemini? 
@_date: 2017-10-04 15:43:21
Ya I invested $20 and you get some money every hour but it takes around 4 weeks to reach the break even point. After the 4 weeks, you can earn profits.
@_date: 2017-10-09 01:13:54
Ok but don’t leave it on CoinBase right? 
@_date: 2017-10-09 01:14:32
So how much would I make if it goes up like it has been so far? 
@_date: 2017-10-11 02:03:16
I have a job. Get paid around $150 a week.
@_date: 2017-10-07 19:52:10
Probably never ��
