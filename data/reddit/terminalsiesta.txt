I disagree. Top 100 on CMC have 50mil marketcap or more. There are a *lot* of coins out there with serious cash to be made by attacking. You could attack almost any coin and potentially make millions.

Had to go to my bank to wire $400 to a stranger's bank account, and the only info I had on them was their account number and that it was located in Las Vegas, NV. Super sketchy lol. I wasn't even sure my bank would let me do it, I was like 20 years old and had never done *any* kind of transactions like that with my account.  I was surprised that they didn't ask me any questions about it. Received my coins about 7 hours later. Must've been how early internet users in the early 90s felt about their first online purchase, haha.

Im confused. Why is the boost cheating? Don't all miners aim for extra hash power, as long as they're under 50% of the network?

@_date: 2017-04-08 02:16:09
What's the reasoning behind allowing empty blocks to be mined in the first place? Shouldn't they auto-fill based on transaction fees across all miners? Also I feel like fees are already really high, are they mining that many more blocks that the imcreased block rewards are more than refusing the transaction fees from filling blocks? I hope that made sense. 
@_date: 2017-04-26 23:39:57
Rowing demand in one exchange globally doesn't necessarily indicate a total growing demand. But I do agree with you that it is most likely a good metric. 
@_date: 2017-04-12 16:11:36
So that will be mining more than 75% of overall blocks for segwit for two weeks straight, starting in two days to activate it then, right? I'm not very tech savvy, just trying to figure it all out

I see it as a shitty dictator has his back against the wall so is willing to try anything to get him out of the hole he's dug himself, including our risky little experiment bitcoin. Does he actually intend to use crypto for everything? No, he just wants anything he can get to inprove his economy. But through usage we will see more people exposed to it. Any adoption is good adoption, imo.

@_date: 2018-02-23 14:08:53
Of course the first country to try to use crypto is using a coin they made and 100% control, and of course their project coin is going to be a failure relative to bitcoin. What did you expect? This is what people have been predicting on this subreddit for years. If this news came out 3 years ago this subreddit would be losing their god damn minds. 
Imo this is the first step to countries adopting bitcoin. Not that adoption is happening next week or next year.. It's just an expected checkpoint they have to go through to learn.

Everything Kardashian sucks ass, but a lot of her fans use her as a barometer for what's fashionable or cool. It's retarded, but that's just the way it is. Not only that, but a large percentage of her followers, I would bet, have never heard of bitcoin, so it's a net positive, I think.

Unless the savings from lack of credit card fees outweighs the extra $ lost in double spends, there's no way any business would implement. It'd be like going back to accepting checks. No way they're gonna spend time and money into accepting a new form of payment that increases losses.

Are there any altcoins out there that by design prohibit mining arms races and pooling? I'm not sure if thats even possible, but it'd be nice if the mining power was distributed evenly over full nodes to encourage everyone to run one.

I tried looking because I was curious, but can't find it. I know he followed up maybe a year later or something. When he invested he took a second mortgage or something along with maxing credit cards, and invested between 80k and 130k, I can't remember, and sold at like $250 in mid April. He pretty much timed the top perfectly, because it crashed hard within a day of him selling. He ended up profiting like 450k or something from a long he held for what, less than three months? Pretty crazy stuff.
