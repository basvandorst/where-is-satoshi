When establishment players (banks, credit card and payment processing companies) build their own blockchain product, they want to *own* the protocol/platform. It is about foundational control with clean slates.
Here's some devil's advocacy:
- The big players may not like lost coins, or Satoshi's huge dormant stash, or enriching early adopters by buying in &gt;$280/btc.
- They may not like the experimental, consensus-driven, patchy culture that we have built so far. Even if we're not perfect yet, maybe they dislike the hard-decentralization nature of BTC.
- Maybe their engineers and managers do not like some of BTC's technical aspects: the choice of SHA256 as hash, the block size limit, the 21 million limit... OPEN SOURCE....
I can imagine some marketing guy disliking the naming psychology of a mBTC/USD pair. Bits? Satoshis? milli-? 'Why not bump up the supply limit in our new cryptocurrency?' (This point is nonsense ofc, due to the divisibility of BTC and such.)
- Big players may not like the early scandals and baggage of BTC. Silk Road and drugs? (lol HSBC) MtGox? Core Developers like Gavin not under their employ?
- (Future) Regulatory rules may require a soft-centralization platform design. Or they want to mould the nascent regulatory environment, so they need to meet governments closer toward the centralization side than the BTC wild west is.
The future big entrants may be quite happy to forgo the hard work (computational work, coding), innovation, marketing and distribution of Bitcoin's protocol and culture. It's not all about profits; there are other worthwhile gains:
- Control over design. The new entrants can learn from Bitcoin's mistakes and emergent quirks (TX mal, double spending, forks, network propagation speed of TX, ASICs) ad copy from BTC's innovation. BTC is open source, so yes, even big banks can pick and choose.
- Clean slates allow for a psychological branding reset for the mainstream that have heard of BTC (and its bad headlines, yet not the good parts).
- For those who haven't heard of bitcoin, banks can market their coin product alongside traditional marketing channels.
- Market Share. They want to catch onto the breakthrough adoption wave (ex. 1995 internet) through foolproof software and institutional tx backbones (POS, NFC, Apple Pay, android pay, fingerprint sensors) (which would never like...) If new products are more convenient and process faster than the bitcoin network, guess what consumers will adopt?
- Professional analysis and design to mitigate liquidity/price crises due to whales, where such *contagion* can spill over to real world markets. We all know banks WILL connect their blockchains/coins to the larger fiat/bond/stock markets.

Concur. The transformation of viewpoints and the overcoming of mental inertia and biases is the most revolutionary thing. It seems insignificant against national metrics, but it is intensely monumental. 
These shifts are the things that fuel political revolutions.
Think, the big villain of state-sponsored cyberspace pre-Snowden was China. More recently, Iran and Syria could be added in there. 
Now, we have ostensible evidence that the US and big brother UK have been insidiously spying and infiltrating 'friendly' networks. It's always been assumed by tinfoil-ers, redditors and netsec experts that the US was always out there on the internet; but now even your MOM knows. 
Sure, SIGINT was what the NSA was for; now we know there are cyber-contractors like Booz Allen as there are Blackwater PMCs working for the US/Western national security apparatus.
Because of Snowden's methodical extraction of sensitive NSA, we know about:
- undeniable and trust-shattering collusion between the NSA and US tech giants.
- a bit of the cavalier and insidious nature and culture of shadow cyber-agencies like the GCHQ when they mock the internet on ppt slides.
- how the NSA does fibre cuts, splitters, and MITM attacks upstream of the tech companies' private fibre anyways!
- how NSA fusion centers suck up TBs of metadata.
- the legal nature of FISA orders, legal requests and gag orders.
- that the NSA can make that 51% determination that you are American.
- the weakening of cryptography standards and trust for the sake of more infiltration.
- the brazen and mass-volume infiltration of German, Brazilian, US domestic and other friendly state and corporate networks, which have precipitated one of the biggest diplomatic scandals in decades. (Unless there is a secret G20 deal where they are really not mad at the US.)
- how the NSA and CSEC are bad, but the UK's GCHQ is worse.
- a whole bunch of CAPITALIZED acronyms! Like MUSCULAR and ONIONBREATH!
And Snowden has the balls to put himself on camera in Hong Kong. And split from his hot girlfriend.
Little chance that Snowden is a US or Chinese plant. The backlash from the release of so many documents is too risky for the risk palate of politicians and generals.
That's why Snowden is my choice for person of the year. Because he's just handsome enough to be a pop culture icon.

It doesn't need to be as heavy as shadow executions. It's a signal, flying above the heads of speculators and triads of China's first bubble, that Beijing is always watching the internet. Especially because of bitcoin's dual nature as an internet and financial disruptive technology.
Sure, real ID just adds legitimacy and someday (maybe 3 months later) Beijing will allow deposits into exchanges again. Then regular Chinese bitcoiners can jump back in. 
But it's a severe blow to any fledgling hope that a Chinese hacker has for greater informational freedom. This goes beyond money. But what do you expect from a Chinese or US govt. that still wields great power? They'd be stupid not to crack down or regulate. State power hasn't declined - yet.

And after all my hard work in reading, translating, and seeing with my own eyes. Sigh.
Anyone can go to search 'btcchina weibo', look at the left sidebar, copy it, google translate, and see if the news about mandatory ID registration with old and new btcchina accounts is true.
But no......
@_date: 2013-12-18 20:49:27
Thanks for the heads up. Nice work last night, it was epic.
@_date: 2013-12-18 06:05:31
Domino time. Where did you find this OKCoin news?
@_date: 2013-11-20 02:03:53
Yeah, I know TIME will pick either Malala or Assad for safe bets. Snowden upsets the cart too much.
Now netizens know about NSA. And the DIA.....
@_date: 2013-12-18 06:01:46
*Gulp* as in we've got a long way to fall this week, because from my translation and google's, this side bar ID news is more serious to me than the weibo image post of suspended deposit. It's CONFIRMED to me.


You can copy/paste the sidebar into google for verification.
That *gulp* was also for the thousands of Chinese men coming back from a horrible lunch from a shit sandwich.

* Looks like BTCChina stopping CNY deposit (recharge, i think).
* Btc deposit; CNY, Btc withdrawals are not affected. (looks like Beijing is softening a mass exit to me, or a nerd uproar)
* BTC China will continue to operate.
* Keep checking their weibo, they will provide alternate ways to deposit funds ASAP.
* "We are deeply deeply sorry for the inconvenience."
Translation confidence: 80% (I hate simplified Chinese)
edit: formatting.
edit 2: Looks like the news on Real ID registration for old *and* new btcchina accounts is **real**. *Gulp.* It's on the left sidebar: [
edit 3: the ID translation for your enjoyment: 


edit 4: Mistake on claiming ban on btc deposits. Misread a comma. Btc deposits still allowed.
@_date: 2013-12-18 05:24:57
Agree, accurate translation. See mine for comparison:[ 
Not surprising that btcchina is trying to find other ways to deposit funds. It's interesting that they mention it, to keep hopes up and money from exiting.

Couple open source with very vigorous public technical code auditing, trustworthy reputation vetting for main accounts without cannibalizing throwaway avatars, and next-gen for-the-public internet encryption where user clients shoulder the processing demands ala the blockchain.
I envision more time consuming, yet direct democracy policy reddit mega-threads that a netizen can access from a phone on a bus. Add some time-delays for policy implementation, and we can reverse knee-jerk emotional upvotes and introduce more political nuance than left vs. right partisanship.
With the recent coding disasters with unwieldy and large source codes such as the F-35 and healthcare.gov- which leave exponentially more zero-day vunerabilities than the best coders can patch- modular, decentralized global open source projects like Firefox Nightly writ large may be a rowdy but interesting way to approach comprehensive software design.
It will be messy to design and coordinate such open source design, but it gives transparency and public input to security design, product feature desiderata and privacy.
Of course, cost, volunteers and motivation are bottlenecks to implementing such a software design paradigm. Consensus is much needed. But it offers a hopeful promise in the style that Bitcoin offers for finance.
That is, while electricity and rare-earth-metal components are cheap and available. And before peak-oil effects hit mainstream. Or while there is enough water supplies for power generation. And the electrical grid is not disrupted by unpatched backdoor power plant hacks. Or while the NSA doesn't try to infiltrate and demonize the fledgling nodes of those next-gen network engineers.
PS. I'm not a programmer.

Accurate. Nice translation.
Looks like China will have no anonymous bitcoiners left, for those with btcchina accounts, old or new. I can picture a lot of young  Chinese men with hands in their hair, seeing how Beijing just screwed over their bubble and will soon know their IDs. So much for Chinese anarcho-hacker freedom for the next year. 
Real ID on the Chinese internet was always used for population control, dissent crackdown, and information control. It was a matter of time until China cracked down on exchanges and the evasive idea of Bitcoin itself. 
We were just blinded by market hysteria to the usual tightfisted Chinese hammer, which they have shown to use without hesitation.

I think 2013 is Snowden's year.
