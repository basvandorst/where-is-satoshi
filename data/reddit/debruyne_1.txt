Confidential amounts does not magically render the supply unauditable. Audit ability becomes more sophisticated though, as you have to rely on more math and soudnness of the implementation. Fortunately, both can be independently verified. Additionally, see this quote:




Lastly, transparent chains aren't necessarily insusceptible to (temporary) undetected inflation bugs.
@_date: 2019-07-15 21:22:21


Transparent chains also kind of rely on the soundness of the implementation in the code, as demonstrated by the recent Bitcoin inflation bug (which fortunately did not get exploited). 


In order to properly achieve fungibility the base layer needs to be fungible though, which requires privacy by default.

Unlike DarkSend, Coinjoin and Joinmarket are pretty fast if I recall correctly. That's mainly because they have a lot of activity. That is, many people are willing to mix their coins with others. 


There are enough options available. It doesn't need a massive innovation in my opinion. It will certainly be a heated debate / political game if it was ever brought up. 


I am betting they are quite effective. Just take Coinbase as example. 


Fair point :) 
@_date: 2015-12-04 00:40:05


DarkSend relies, similiar to CoinJoin, on activity to work (you need others to mix with), that's whythe transactions are so horrendously slow currently. DarkSend is just an improved version of CoinJoin as far as I know. 


They still have them, but fair point such a thing certainly sparked demand. 


I tend to agree with this, quite suspicious in my opinion. 


Like I said, it's just an improved version of CoinJoin as far as I know. It's a bit more detailed than that. Gmaxwell also had the following to say about it -&gt; 


I think the usage is somewhat underestimated. Nearly all people making use of darknet markets tumble/mix their coins and darknet markets account for a relatively large percent of the Bitcoin transactions. 
Good last paragraph by the way. In addition, in the past Blocktrail was selling freshly minted coins for a premium. Not sure why they stopped with that, but it's just an example. 


There is only one way in my opinion, mixing needs to be enforced at the protocol level. 
P.S. If you are interested in "private" coins I would advise checking out Monero. It uses stealth addresses to achieve unlinkability and ring signatures to achieve untraceability. Furthermore, both are enforced at the protocol level, making Monero fungible. In the future Ring CT (Confidential Transactions (derived from the one proposed for Bitcoin)), which is currently being researched and tested, will hide amounts as well. This is for example how a Monero transaction looks live on the blockchain -&gt; 
If you need more information, I suggest heading over to r/monero. I don't really want to clutter r/bitcoin with it :-P

They probably would have banned it early on. Bitcoin's transparency is probably the reason why they are so lenient. Bitcoin is like the government's wet dream, they can basically track everyone. 
@_date: 2015-12-04 20:35:12
A fungible coin means that it's perfectly interchangeable. Ask yourself  the following, would you want to trade your Bitcoins with some that have a history on the darknet markets? If the answer is no, then Bitcoin is simply not fungible. Fungability basically means all Bitcoins are equal, regardless of their past. However, one can observe their past due to transparent blockchain and because of this people/companies will have preferences for which kind of Bitcoins to accept/buy. 
@_date: 2015-12-03 21:53:47


Darkcoin, which has been rebranded to DASH, isn't fungible either. You can still make use of transparent transactions, for instance via InstantX. You can "anonymize" your DASH with DarkSend, however it is currently horrendously slow. Just a few days ago, an user reported it took him over 20 hours to fully anonymize his DASH and I've seen reports like this before as well. See -&gt; 
Furthermore, the fact that they "instamined" 2 million (apparently due to a bug in the code, which affected the difficulty retargeting),    which is ~33% of their current supply, didn't help either. More on that here -&gt; 


Uhm, did you miss Confidential Transactions, Joinmarket, Coinjoin, stealth addresses, address reuse? There certainly is a demand for privacy. 


Enforcing mixing like CoinJoin on the protocol level, thus making it mandatory would be quite easy/feasible. However, it would induce a lot of discussion/politics just like currently is happening with the blocksize debate. Expect heated discussions if something like that ever gets proposed. 


Just wait until it gets a more salient problem. We already got blockchain analysis companies and tools, like for example -&gt;  &amp;  Furthermore, even though you bought your coins legally, they could still be tainted due to being used on, for instance, darknet markets in the past. 
A more concrete example: 
Let's say Alice sells a painting on OpenBazaar that is bought by Bob. Alice assumes Bob is a law abiding citizin and thus sends her BTC to Coinbase to exchange them for US dollars. However, what Alice didn't know is that Bob isn't the law abiding citizen that she thought he was. That is, Bob occasionally sells some illicit stuff on the darknet markets and used his proceeds to buy the painting. As a result, Alice gets flagged by Coinbase for trying to sell "tainted" coins.  
@_date: 2015-12-03 21:06:56


For what it's worth, they also monitor your incoming transactions. This once again shows that Bitcoin has a serious fungibility problem, which I unfortunately think will not be resolved anytime soon. As long as transparent transactions are still possible on the blockchain, Bitcoin will simply not be fungible. Or, in other words, Bitcoin needs some kind of mandatory mixing at the protocol level in order to achieve fungibility. 
EDIT: I should also add that there still is a common misconception that Bitcoin is anonymous.

@_date: 2016-03-08 16:35:07
Perhaps my comment was too black and white, but the fact that you can differentiate between certain coins in Bitcoin makes it not fungible. Unless you have privacy/anonymity enforced (and thus mandatory) on the protocol level, you will only slightly improve fungibility with "mixing" options because one can still differentiate between certain coins. 


If Bitcoin would've been fungible from the start, most of these practices wouldn't be needed. 


With that I agree. However, Bitcoin makes it fairly easy to de-anonymize themselves. 
@_date: 2016-01-06 22:39:05
Agree that fungibility is a way bigger issue than blocksize currently. However, unless something gets enforced (thus mandatory) at the protocol level, it won't significantly improve Bitcoin's fungibility, because merchants can simply state that they only accept transparent coins or coins with a transparent history. 
@_date: 2016-03-01 16:07:21
Here is some more info regarding the adaptive blocksize limit Monero uses:
(comment is from Tacotime, one of the core-team members of Monero)

Fungibility is actually of utmost importance for a currency. 
Unless you have privacy/anonymity enforced (and thus mandatory) on the protocol level, you will only slightly improve fungibility because one can still differentiate between certain coins. That is, merchants could choose to only accept coins with a transparent history. Therefore, something optional is only a slight improvement to fungiblity. In addition, miners could for instance blacklist certain types of transactions (CoinJoin) and only allow transparent transactions.
The stealth addresses inherent to the Monero protocol achieve unlinkability, whereas the ring signatures inherent to the Monero protocol achieve untraceability. Combine these two and you achieve fungibility. The definition of fungibility is that all coins are perfectly interchangeable. That is, no coin has different properties. Or, the history (taint) of a coin shouldn't affect its value. Bear in mind that cash is also fungible, even though it has serial numbers, because it is enforced by the law. Finally, adding CT (derived from Gmaxwell) will ty up some loose ends, see:

Furthermore, the fact that you can't verify the coin supply is another caveat in my opinion. 
@_date: 2016-03-22 19:14:39
CT in Bitcoin merely hides amounts, which isn't really an improvement for privacy. However, if used in conjunction with CoinJoin it will greatly improve privacy for transactions (it improves CoinJoin too)

Sure, but that isn't the problem. With an opaque blockchain, you can still provide reasonable documentation. 
The problem here is that Bitpay is flagging customers because of the history of their coins. The fact that the customer might not even be aware of their tainted coins, but still risks the possiblity of getting flagged is a huge **fundamental** issue. Fungibility means that all coins are interchangeable regardless of their history. 
An example to give weight to my previous statement:
Let's say Alice sells a painting on OpenBazaar that is bought by Bob. Alice assumes Bob is a law abiding citizin and thus sends her BTC to Coinbase to exchange them for US dollars. However, what Alice didn't know is that Bob isn't the law abiding citizen that she thought he was.

Bear in mind that Monero has an adaptive blocksize limit and therefore is not subject to any blocksize issue. 
Monero is currently also in the process of integrating Confidential Transactions, which on top of the anonymity it already provides (stealth addresses in order to achieve unlinkablility and ring signatures in order to achieve untraceability) will also hide amounts. 
@_date: 2016-01-08 15:12:54


Agree, it is a way bigger issue than everyone thinks it is. However, BTC will only get fungibile if some kind of mixing gets enforced (thus mandatory) on the protocol level. Otherwise, merchants/exchanges can simply state that they only accept coins with a transparent history.

@_date: 2016-01-08 18:21:48
I might be mistaken, but can't they reasonably do so by simply looking at the amount of inputs and outputs? If I recall correctly, CoinJoin transactions are fairly easy to spot, but that might be improved. I, and others probably too, would be very interested in  example of a normal transaction and a CoinJoin transaction that look similiar.  
I agree that CoinJoin and Coinswap both improve fungibility and unlinkablity to some extent, but it still won't result in untraceability. 
@_date: 2016-01-08 17:51:30
Just look at how much controversy the current blocksize debate has caused and how it basically divided the community. Fungibility is a way bigger issue than blocksize and will most likely also spark an even more heated debate. 
All these privacy options are certainly an improvement. However, BTC will only get fungibile if some kind of mixing gets enforced (thus mandatory) on the protocol level. Otherwise, merchants/exchanges can simply state that they only accept coins with a transparent history.

Explained by u/fluffyponyza here:
For the lazy ones:


And the blockchain is quite prunable, you can throw away everything except the key image set and the txoset. Since Bitcoin's utxoset is unbounded it means we have an analogous pruning mechanism, although if we had a hypothetical world where both had the exact same number of transactions then a pruned Monero node would require more data than a similarly pruned Bitcoin node. However, that pruned node could create completely obfuscated transactions offline and without any interaction with other participants.
@_date: 2016-06-01 11:28:54


First and foremost, it shouldn't mind for the discussion which kind of "user" I am. 


I am going to argue it is. People can actually get into trouble if the they receive tainted coins with offering a legal product or performing legal services. For instance, let's say Alice sells a painting on OpenBazaar that is bought by Bob. Alice assumes Bob is a law abiding citizin and thus sends her BTC to Coinbase to exchange them for US dollars. However, what Alice didn't know is that Bob isn't the law abiding citizen that she thought he was. That is, Bob occasionally sells some illicit stuff on the darknet markets and used his proceeds to buy the painting. As a result, Alice gets flagged by Coinbase for trying to sell "tainted" coins.
It really shouldn't matter what the previous owner of the coins (or bills in the case of cash) did with them. In Bitcoin it **matters**. Ask yourself, would you rather accept Bitcoins directly from a newly minted block or coins that have been used to purchase drugs? 


These features will certainly improve privacy of the Bitcoin user. It won't, however, make Bitcoin fungible unless it gets enforced on the protocol level (thus mandatory and default), which would make all coins equal. 


"Normal" transactions are actually smaller than Bitcoin transactions. However, the ring signatures makes them bigger, but not as "huge" as you describe. If I recall correctly, they are actually 2-3 times as big, but that is currently the trade-off for privacy. With respect to pruning, Monero can prune too albeit less efficient than Bitcoin. Pruning already exists in a fork (kind of an experimental testbed) of Monero, namely AEON. See:
Besides, I think storage problems and bloat is kind of a non-issue with Moore's law taken into account. What we should worry about, and this applies to Bitcoin too, is among others, bandwith, latency, and computer performance. 


I beg to differ, as I stated before unless the privacy features of Bitcoin get enforced on the protocol level (thus mandatory and default) Bitcoin isn't fungible. In Monero, privacy is enforced on the protocol level and therefore Monero is fungible. Besides, Monero has got a lot more to offer than merely fungibility. One of those features is the adaptive blocksize limit, which has been working fine for over 2 years. One can read about it here: 
P.S. To be clear, I don't think Monero will overtake Bitcoin. I personally envision it as a complementary coin to Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-06-01 11:41:07


Cash. Cash is fungible because it is enforced by the law, i.e., bills have the same properties regardless of their serial number and history.


Sure, but if you can prove it you can afford it wealth wise or income wise there are no issues. But that's just good old-fashioned police work. The history of the piece of gold won't matter. In Bitcoin, the history of a coin matters, that is the real problem. I explained this more extensively in my other post.


50% is a bit optimistic here. Tell me, who in the Bitcoin ecosystem doesn't do flagging? I bet you all the (major) exchanges do, except for perhaps BTC-e. 99% of the Bitcoin merchants are connected to either Coinbase, Bitpay, or some other payment processor and I am certain they all do flagging. Those that directly accept Bitcoin probably don't do flagging, but that's just a small, and probably negligible, part of the Bitcoin ecosystem. 
@_date: 2016-06-01 10:45:27
Bitcoin lacks the most important property of (electronic) cash, namely fungibility. That is, all coins are perfectly interchangeable regardless of their history. 
Coinbase and other merchants/exchanges flagging coins with a certain history (e.g. darknetmarket usage) clearly shows that Bitcoin isn't fungible. 
@_date: 2016-06-01 12:02:46
[1] Makes no sense at all, again.

The CryptoNote coins (best known for their ring signatures and stealth addresses) are using an adaptive blocksize limit. See comment below from &gt;As I noted in the thread, this is similar to the block sizing algorithm for Monero and other CryptoNote coins. A quadratic penalty is imposed such that block subsidy = base subsidy * ((block size / median size of last 400 blocks) - 1)2, with the penalty being applied after you build a block larger than the median size. The maximum block size is 2*median size. Because subsidy is based around the number of coins in existence, the 'burned' subsidy is deferred to be paid out to future blocks.

@_date: 2019-02-12 16:11:06


That does not matter. An attacker would be able to stealthily inflate the supply if an implementation bug was present. This applies to both Bitcoin (in case Confidential Transactions are added) and Monero. 


Coinbase transaction amounts are not masked in Monero. As a result, an observer is able to sum up all coinbase outputs. Nonetheless, aforementioned attack is still applicable.

In addition, miners can differentiate between certain types of transactions. Before you give me the "CoinJoin/Joinmarket transactions look similiar to normal transparent transactions" again, please provide me with a few examples, which you failed to do so during our previous dicussion. 


I somewhat agree with this part, only that it will improve instead of solve. Like I said before, only enforcing solves it, whereas all other optional privacy options only (slightly) improve it.

They work because it is enforced by **the law**. I already stated this earlier. Unless the law states to accept all Bitcoins and Bitcoin transactions regardless of their history, it isn't similiar. 


Fair point, though governments can still prohibit miners / pools from including those kind of transactions into a block. 


Hadn't really heard of that before. Thanks for making me aware of it, will look into it. 


I laid out the reasons why it doesn't solve it in my previous posts. Mainly because you can still differntiate. You are also presuming privacy options get widely used.


You still have to go from the main network to the sidechain, which could leave a trace. Also, I am not confident a viable solution has been found yet for the security of sidechains. Too many caveats currently with them. 
@_date: 2016-02-19 01:42:59
This again highlights the pervasive fungibility issue inherent to Bitcoin. In my opinion, this issue is bigger than the current blocksize issue and, if ever addressed, will cause a much larger and more heated debate.
The definition of fungibility is that all coins are perfectly interchangeable. That is, no coin has different properties. Or, the history (taint) of a coin shouldn't affect its value. Bear in mind that cash is also fungible, even though it has serial numbers, because it is enforced by the law. 
Unless you have privacy/anonymity enforced (and thus mandatory) on the protocol level, "solutions" such as Confidential Transactionswill, Coinjoin, and Joinmarket will only slightly improve fungibility because one can still differentiate between certain coins. That is, merchants could choose to only accept coins with a transparent (or "clean") history. Therefore, something optional is only a slight improvement to fungiblity. In addition, miners could for instance blacklist certain types of transactions (CoinJoin) and only allow transparent transactions.
In addition, an example of why fungibility is very important:

@_date: 2016-02-19 12:38:54
That certainly is an option, hopefully it will be enforced on the protocol level. 


Monero exists today and achieves privacy too. The stealth addresses inherent to the Monero protocol achieve unlinkability, whereas the ring signatures inherent to the Monero protocol achieve untraceability. Combine these two and you achieve fungibility. Finally, adding Ring Confidential Transactions will ty up some loose ends, see:
With Ring CT implemented, the difference in privacy between Monero and Zerocash will be negligible. Also, Monero was fairly launched and decentralized, whereas Zerocash has a "trusted setup" and the Founders Reward, which takes 20% of the block reward in the first 4 yours.

We can be reasonable sure that coins from (or to) certain destinations are tainted, think darknetmarkets, gambling sites etc.. The fact that there even is such a thing as taint already has a detrimental effect on fungibility.

To solve all our privacy problems they have. Otherwise one can still differentiate between certain types of coins. I also explained this in my earlier comment. I agree all of these will improve it, but not solve it.


Agree, although currently 80-90% of the addresses get reused, and users are probably to ignorant to change this themselves.

We need a combination of certain ones enforced at the protocol level to solve all our Bitcoin privacy problems. Alas, it'll be difficult to get there.
@_date: 2016-02-19 11:06:10
Reusable payment codes are a good step forward, if implement on the protocol level, because currently 80-90% of all addresses get reused. However, reusable payment codes only achieve unlinkability. Not untraceability, unfortunately. 
@_date: 2016-02-19 11:05:08
Which only makes it worse in my opinion.

In the case Alice follows aformentioned procedure, Bob still has plausible deniability though.

Sure, but you still have to go in and out the sidechain.

[1] There are plans to make Monero Bitcoin-compatible. In other words, it will be just as easy to integrate as bitcoin clones -&gt;  
[2] There already is a solution for pruning which is currently being tested in AEON (an experimental testbed for Monero features), see -&gt; &amp; 
Another informational link about pruning in Monero (bit short though) -&gt; 
[3] With Moore's law in the back of your mind, I don't think blockchain bloat will be that much of an issue.

This will only hide that Alice gave Bob 2 BTC. Unfortunately, it won't hide that Alice gave Bob BTC.

I am not that tech-savvy, so I will try to explain as best as I can. First, check design goals and see "merchant additions" -&gt;  There you see walletnotify / blocknotify functionality, this is to make it similiar to how Bitcoin works for merchants. In addition, the RPC API will be Bitcoin-compatible. There was something else if I recall correctly, but can't recall that of the top of my hat. Perhaps knows the answer to this :-P

Unfortunately, Confidential Transactions only hides amounts. Metadata and addresses are still visible. Btw, Monero is also working on its own implementation of Confidential Transactions -&gt; 
ELI5 how Monero will work after CT implementation: 
Next to hidden origins and destinations that are inherent to the Monero protocol (provided by ring signatures + stealth addresses), this will also hide amounts, while viewkeys will still work, and of course it will still be auditable.

That's because the law states one must accept Euro notes regardless of their serial number. 
@_date: 2015-11-06 16:39:54
"Fast" is a bit subjective, but I am not here to argue with you about that. However, I want to correct you on the emission schedule, your numbers are a bit excessive. The real numbers can be found here -&gt; 
Graph here -&gt; 
The ~70% is in 3 years, instead of one year. Furthermore, Monero has a perpetual inflation. That is, after all the initial coins are emitted, Monero has an inflation of ~1% a year. It's actually 0.3 XMR per block (blocktime is 1 minute (will be changed to 2 soon, but rewards will stay the same, so still 0.3 per minute)). Due to this formula, percentage wise the inflation gets lower every year.

First of all, even with mixin = 0, stealth addresses protect your privacy to some extent. In addition, mixin &gt;= 3 will be mandatory after the upcoming hardfork, read more about it here -&gt;  &amp; 
EDIT: Should've added that the high frequency of mixin = 0 mostly is due to exchanges sending out withdrawals with mixin = 0. This will change with the upcoming release though. In addition, the wallet and the webwallet already use mixin = 3 by default. 
@_date: 2015-10-23 17:50:11
Unless they make privacy solutions mandatory on the protocol level, precisely this will happen. It could take a while, but I am pretty sure we'll gravitate towards it. 
@_date: 2015-11-16 11:04:45
Then it's quite obvious that someone is counterfeiting right? :-P

The biggest caveat of DarkSend is that it's horrendously slow. I've seen reports from a guy stating that it took him 3 hours to fully anonymize 2 DASH. Someone else reported that it took him a few days to anonymize a large amount.

If anyone is interested, here is the review of the whitepaper by the Monero Research Lab ( -&gt;

It was basically implemented to give miners continuing incentive

The biggest caveat with DarkSend is that it takes hours to even fully anonymize a few DASH. In addition, I have seen reports from people that it took ~3 days to anonymize larger amounts (1k+).

I've read it somewhere a while ago, I'll look if I can dig it up again. Not entirely sure how the latter works, not that knowledgeable about laws specifically :-P 
@_date: 2015-11-15 19:29:09
You are right. The intention behind my comment was that for example a grocery store can't accept notes that start with a Y and simultaneously decline notes that start with a Z. 
@_date: 2015-10-13 08:02:11


It does currently, but there are suggestions to hide it (ring Confidential Transactions (CT) for Monero), see -&gt; 
@_date: 2016-05-19 21:10:03
Monero's dynamic blocksize has been working fine for over 2 years and one can view the specifications in the code. However, it has to be adjusted for Bitcoin because Monero has a tail emission, whereas Bitcoin hasn't.
