mBTC and uBTC are compromises. Compromises are BAD things. They are ugly and needlessly complex. 
We need to skip the scientific notation for simplicity and beauty's sake. 
satoshi/bits are needed NOW. They give a sense of how large one BTC actually is, and they are easy to talk about and transact in. There is no mental overhead. 
When dealing with mBTC uBTC there is a lot of mental overhead and its not needed.

Traders and markets can stay with BTC. Take away mBTC. BTC makes sense on markets because the higher number in USD looks sexy. 
Users and merchants should switch though. It's really so simple. Digital world allows us to do these kinds of things.
And it is NEVER too late to make the right choice.
Anways like my edited post says I have to head out. Wish I could stick around.

SI is rocket surgery to most people. You lack empathy. So you may be a smart dude who is pretty good at things like reading and understanding maths etc, but most people aren't and don't care. 
The large number overhead really isn't a problem in the future. Like I said, look at korea. If BTC reaches 10,000 USD then 1 satoshi would be at parity with 1 won.
What is a problem is the constant switching between compromises. When will it end?
First mBTC. One year later, uBTC. One year later, Satoshi finally.
Just pull the band-aid now.

Good. Too many soft spoken people nowadays. Nothing gets done. This is the situation we are in. Open your eyes. I would rather be loud and wrong then to never speak up and watch something stupid happen right in front of my eyes.

The definition wouldn't change. 
    bit
    1. a small piece, part, or quantity of something.
That EXACTY describes what I am talking about.

Explain why BTC needs decimals
Here is your chance to shine
and go:

Wrong is usually right.

At current prices that would be what a 5 dollar drink or so.
Say BTC goes to 10k at some point, a 5 dollar drink would be ~100,000 bits , or to use your argument
105,345 bits.
It's really not a big deal at all. Do you really think your drinks you buy now actually cost 1.99 or 2.99? The sellers know of the problem and adjust accordingly.
So they would round to 105,000 110,00 bits etc. This is a solved problem.

Yes. But also a bit.

It's a nice narrative but I don't think FB would be interested in buying Coinbase because they are not the clear winner in this space. They don't even have real competition yet. 
I think that they will make a move on something cryptocurrency within the year though. 
But I won't be eating a hat if I'm wrong.

A bit is also a small amount of something. There can be many definitions for the same word, and most people aren't familiar with the computer science meaning for the word.
If I said to 'hand over a bit of bread' most people would think in terms of small amounts, and not in terms of 'units of information'.
Clearly you are wrong

I can't believe you are giving me pushback based on word definitions ahahah... come back with a real argument man wtf.
