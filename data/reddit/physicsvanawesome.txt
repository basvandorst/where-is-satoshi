Next to zero chance of that happening. How much money is tied up in USDT waiting on the sidelines for a bottom or confirmed bullish breakout? If the price falls precipitously, I imagine a lot of hands would reach out to slow the fall.

Property taxes are higher and there is also a state sales tax tacked on to everything.

This was originally the case, however, they actually rewrote the legislation such that the state wasn't obliged to accept crypto, merely study it. The legislation as it was forced the state to accept it as a payment, now it seems more conditional.  Personally, I took that to mean that they will accept it as long as things are going well and if things don't go well they can simply stop and it won't take an act of state congress to amend the legislation.  Technically, Seminole county is the first to outright accept it without caveats.

Oh ho! So, more sanitized that I realized. 
Welp, kudos to Seminole county. I may try to see if there is anything I can do in my county; Seminole is not too far from here, I bet I could make convincing arguments to the right people in my county.

Shit, I need to be faster on the draw.

...it wouldn't. The point being that some altcoins have features that bitcoin doesn't/can't have. Bitcoin is emerging as a store of value rather than anything else, which is fine.  You can't write distributed apps on the bitcoin blockchain, and if that is what you need to do, then you would use an altcoin.  My reply was meant to underscore the fact that altcoins aren't going out the door just because the lightning network is up and running.  These are different cryptos for different uses.

Lol....yea, because lightning suddenly makes bitcoin a turing complete programming language.  Transaction speed and network capacity are not the only reason altcoins have a lot to offer over bitcoin.

Atomic swaps. Pathfinding. Asset tokenization. Protection against 51% attacks...There are plenty of things that Alts do much better than bitcoin other than transaction speed.

Inefficient, perhaps, but distributed blockchains are important for immutability and transparency.

lol okay man, I have nothing to prove here. I'm not the one ignoring the scientific evidence.  
You're literally not worth my time.

No shit it isn't; I too saw the red underline when I purposefully typed it out.  There wasn't a word that appropriately captured the magnitude of your idiocy.

[The existence of a link between superior intellect and mental illness is a well documented phenomenon](  If you took a second to google search instead of cobbling together half-coherent imbecilisms, you'd find articles [like this]( and [like this](  Your thesis is bad and you should feel bad. It would seem that the only irrational one denying reality here would be you.
