I definitely will. But I'm going to buy something off xbla for sure.

Usually I'd say you're right. But I like to consider myself pretty intelligent and I don't see the catch here.

Oh. I hadn't even considered that I might be breaking a rule. I thought honesty would be better than the obvious ignorant fishing posts. If my post is breaking a rule I'll happily rescind it.
That said, you're so kind. Thanks so much.
How would I verify I'm not lying without giving away my personal info though? As you might imagine, online privacy is important me. Especially as a girl gamer. So many creeps!
I think I figured it out.

It seemed that most people were recommending it. That and mycelium (don't have an android phone though) and bread wallet. I looked at bread wallet but I'm not comfortable yet with the idea of using my phone since I could lose it. Still toying with it though.
Also Green address was just really complex.

In the words of Edea, "mrgrgr".

I understand that. It was more about the possibility that I could lose my phone and someone could gain access to spend what I have. Losing my desktop is a lot less likely.

Is this sufficient? I look pretty disheveled as I've just been bumming around today but my give a damn level just isn't very high today.
I hope I did this right. I searched for how to upload photos to reddit and it directed me to imgur.

I totally understand and would feel the same.
And thank you!
@_date: 2014-12-13 18:31:38
Wow! I don't even know what to say. Thank you doesn't seem sufficient.
@_date: 2014-12-13 18:40:58
Thank you so much! This is crazy.
