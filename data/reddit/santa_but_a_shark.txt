Tbh I think here, England, we say Euros. Like 10 Euros as opposed to 10 Euro.

Individually I know what all of those words mean but as a collective in that order, I’m fucked.

Lmao, no don’t be sorry man. I’m glad as fuck we aren’t EU, lol, bloody Euro-trash. I just get strange picture of Belgium and cucumbers that are only *just so* bent.....and the EU’s eternal fuckery whenever I hear or see the term/acronym EU.  England sooooo isn’t weird dude, lol, I know you aren’t being rude in a serious way, it’s more ‘banter’. I’m sure snowflakes will see my comment and think I’m some Neo-Nazi right wing monster or some reddit faggery, idk. 
(leaving 


will get downvoted but Jesus, so what, we’re all way too sensitive now).
One can’t have a bit of banter etc without some assclown getting all hurty about some bs. I certainly wouldn’t want the bad old days back but I do wish people wouldn’t be so quick to call *racism* or *sexism* or some *ism*, ugh. We’re all pretty much grown up, let’s not act like we need our hand holding all the way home.

Lol, but the action which requires more concentration, ie formulating and typing out a reply, came so easily...

Yeah ten pound fifty is what most ppl would say here. 
Maybe ten pounds and fifty pence if they were emphasising the *full* cost with the pence aswell. 
I guess each currency is worded differently in those circumstances.
