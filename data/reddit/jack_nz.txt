I've just been through this. The easiest way is to export the private keys into something which is compatible (Electrum worked for me), and then you can send to Coinbase or wherever else you like.

Sounds like Bretton Woods in 1944, after which all other currencies involved are pegged to the USD (the global reserve currency) at a fixed rate. In this case all other altcoins involved pegged themselves to btc (the global reserve digital currency™) at their chosen exchange rate. Yes?
@_date: 2014-07-09 12:39:52
Yeh I understand from the perspective of the miner or someone like myself who already has btc. But I dont see a strong rationale with this to convince my still skeptical friends. Still waiting for the killer app, which this isnt it I guess.. :p
@_date: 2014-08-27 12:58:31
Thanks for the reply. Does that mean that the wallet works independent of your servers, and the private keys are held somewhere within the client? And if the servers and service go completely down, the client will still transfer funds to any address through the Send command in My Wallet?

The private keys to my Wallet Address in the Ultra-coin client is only held by you guys, right? If you went dark then even if the trades were refunded to the respective original addresses, how would I be able to transfer those funds to other addresses from the Wallet?
@_date: 2014-04-09 07:08:25
I might just go straight to Armory... the majority of folks seem to recommend that as the gold standard provided you have the pc capability, patience and are willing to learn it properly.
@_date: 2014-10-12 05:10:18
Understand. But maybe theres a way to develop a lightweight partial node that utilised block pruning, and/or works with other partial nodes to make a full node, or something. Like I said I don't know technically how to do it, but we should be aiming to have every one of the 1+ billion phones in the world able to help secure the network. Remember that over time PCs will be used less, and once block halving happens a few more times, we dont know what will happen to the mining industry given the change in incentives. What we will (hopefully) be left with though are millions and millions of people using btc on their smartphones. And if we can have them also contribute to network strength too, then, well, you can imagine how big that would be.

@_date: 2014-02-18 13:33:57
I know this is the unpopular opinion here, but I actually think this is good news. The reason is that some specific (and hopefully light/smart) form of regulation will legitimize the currency as hasn't been done up until now. The fear of the US Govt making it illegal (in any way) will be gone, and it will also clear up some of the legal murkiness that may be preventing larger players from adopting it.

I think Overstocks adoption of bitcoin is great news like everyone else, but I do have to smile at Mr Byrne- if you think bitcoin is promising, buy a whole bunch and then have your company be one of the first major adopters. Then talk your book to the moon! Good on him.

I mean a fixed XBTXRN rate. I commented on this a bit above, but the difference is in the purpose of XRN. Reddit can do whatever they like with it and allow it to serve specific purposes that benefit themselves and their users. Bitcoin is more of a universal coin, which is out of their control. 
I also guess they haven't worked it all out, which is why I thought now was a good time to throw this idea in the ring...:)  Also, I think someone will eventually heavily back btc and the Blockchain in some similar form (such as the market Patrick Byrne talks about) and it would be cool if Reddit was the first to make such a big move.
@_date: 2014-04-01 13:14:20
Thanks again. Very helpful.
Sorry, MBA=MacBook Air. Its a old one, but Im planning to get a new one for the online pc and use this old one for the offline fella.
I'm going to stick at it, but its nice to get a little more comfortable with it. Its worth the investment if I know my coins are safe!
@_date: 2014-08-25 01:53:49
+1 Its confusing. My first thought was fck, another great application that Im never going to use cause I need to buy another waste-of-time altcoin. Then I Googled it and ended up at ultracoin.net. Yet I persisted and am going to give it a crack. However most people wont get this far.
IMHO you need to rebrand to get rid of 1. any reference to a 'coin', unless its 'bitcoin'. And 2. Get away from confusion with the other altcoin.
With all due respect, I'm not at all being critical towards the product which I haven't used yet, but I do feel you'll will be disadvantaged by your current marketing/branding.

@_date: 2014-02-26 17:39:03
Can you guys see any issues with the following approach:
1. Format and re-install the OS on an old MacBook Air
2. (I guess theres no way to do this offline, so will need to disconnect from the internet at this point, without having installed anything other than the OS.)
3. DL Armory on another Mac, transferring the installer with a USB stick. Then send all coins to an address (addresses?) on that Armory.
4. Back a backup of private keys onto another USB stick, which gathers dust in my drawer.
5. And said MBA never again touches the internet. All transactions are done 'offline'.
6. Add read-only addresses into Blockchain app to make sure theyre all still there.
Is Armory greatly better than MultiBit for this purpose?
Oh man, I was worried before, but now Im even more paranoid about my coins getting stolen...

"The money will go toward implementing these developers’ primary project: Sidechains, which aim to bypass bitcoin’s rigid organizational structure by creating parallel blockchains in which innovators can safely develop new Bitcoin 2.0 applications without jeopardizing bitcoin’s core computer code and putting billions of dollars’ worth of digital currency at risk."

Does this effectively mean that BitPay is guaranteeing that the payment will be accepted on the block chain, and assuming that risk instead of the merchant?
I know this risk is low, and this is a huge leap in not making the user waiting 10+ minutes for confirmations, but the risk is somewhat less than 0, right?

Yup, thats one problem. I don't have the answers unfortunately.
But for example, could you 99% verify transactions with say just the most recent 2-3GB of the block chain? Which as it syncs and downloads more, discards the oldest blocks as it goes?

This is EXACTLY where btc can thrive. The worlds first global currency. (Although I personally believe its net first real world second.) This first hit me when I traveled from Asia to Dublin (get screwed once in fx and transaction fees to change to Euros), then took a bus to Belfast, an wtf, they dont accept Euros in Northern Island! Get screwed a second time changing Euros to 'Northern Irish Pounds', which I was then told I couldnt actually use in the UK either. All I could think was y'all folks just need bitcoin.

@_date: 2014-10-08 05:14:14
Seems that I could have made my point better. What I was trying to say is that even 1% of their prediction, about $42,000, is a pretty optimistic statement. (I know there are those here who will disagree with that, and I hope those people are proven right.) Still, $4.2m per coin is a massive call. 
Edit: And for 1c on the $1, I meant they could have them for 1% of their predicted $4.2m. Yes, that was quite unclear. Oops.
@_date: 2014-09-08 13:31:21
I had beers with a wealth manager from UBS last week. He had never ever even heard of bitcoin before. That completely amazed me, but reminded me I'm living in this small yet cutting edge finance/tech bubble (with all you folks), and gave me hope. 
@_date: 2014-07-17 14:32:35
Okay, I dont know how to digest all this. But I do this that this provides more clarity as to the regulatory standpoint. That tells us two things: 1. Btc is not going to be made illegal. And 2. it makes it easier for large corporations to adopt it due to the additional clarity. Therefore just the release of these is I think in some form good news.

@_date: 2014-12-21 13:06:24
That's a very valid point. How about the following: 
1. I don't think all cryotos should be considered the same, even if theyre the same asset class. Bitcoin is much much bigger in terms of users, market cap, wallets, exchanges etc, and is the basically the established major 'store of value' for cryptos. (I know volatility is debatable, but hopefully its on its way). I think its fair to say that the objective of the btc community is for 'universal' adoption and for btc to be the cornerstone of cryptos.
2. In contrast, Redditnotes are a very specific crypto just for the Reddit community, to be used for specific purposes determined by Reddit management. The scope of this, and the uses for these notes are much much smaller. 
3. Backing Redditnotes with either shares or btc would both put value into the hands of users. But the value of private company shares are an illiquid market with the last price effectively determined by what the last investor agreed on. Btc has a much more transparent and liquid market.
4. Backing the Redditnotes by btc would also benefit the company as this is an proactive and innovative use of btc and the blockchain that theoretically would increase its total value. Is their $5m better in start-from-nothing Redditnotes, or notes which are pegged to bitcoin at its current value? 
5. It would also be a huge move. It would set a great precedent for others if successful, and possibly a future direction for private monies. Reddit is in a unique position to the power to think really big, so it would be awesome to see them do something like this.
@_date: 2014-06-09 11:47:44

ビットコイン:「楽天でも導入」　三木谷社長が予測
毎日新聞　2014年07月15日　東京朝刊
　楽天の三木谷浩史社長は１４日、福岡市内で講演し「今年はインターネット革命が加速する。恐らく楽天も早晩（ネット上の仮想通貨）ビットコインでのお金を受け付けるようになると思う」などと述べた。
　講演は、運営するネット上の仮想商店街「楽天市場」の出店者向けに開かれた。三木谷社長はビットコイン導入を予測する理由として「経済が不安定な国は自国の貨幣より安心できるという状態ができつつある」との認識を示した。
　またインターネットの可能性について「見る、読む、買うだけではなく、あらゆる取引に関わってくる。既存のものがどういう機能を果たしているか再定義され、新しいサービスがどんどん出てくる」と発言。例として、フェイスブックを信用材料に、自分の部屋をホテル代わりに貸すサービスなどを挙げた。【遠山和宏】
Basically CEO Mikitani says "the speed of the 'internet revolution' is increasing this year, and he thinks Rakuten will start accepting bitcoin at some stage".

@_date: 2014-07-18 03:12:16
Okay heres what I think, and Im an expert in bullshit thoughts that may have some semblance of logic, so listen up. (Please.)
We all know that noone, not even Governments can stop bitcoin. However, through legitimate (read regulated) exchanges, Wall Street can join, and 'bitcoin banks' like Circle and Xapo will grow, thrive and bring in the masses (we are not the masses btw). Bear with me. I LIKEN THIS TO THE APP STORE.
In parallel, you will have the non-US firms, who dont need to comply to this. You will have the more 'underground' innovation and underground users. I liken this to Pirate Bay, Torrents, VLC etc, all of which also cannot be stopped. This will also thrive, just in other parts of the world.
So all in all, for much of the bitcoin world its business as usual. But for NY and the US, this will drive some businesses away, but will also help bring big money and many more regular Joe users.

The other reason this is a big news, for those unfamiliar with Japan, is that in a country in which business mavericks arent really embraced, Mikitani is one of the only ones who has been able to move and shake within the old guard establishment and also the government. Softbanks Son would be the other good example of this. He would a helpful supporter when it came to regulation time.

As someone bullish on bitcoin, this is a sad thread. We talk theoretically about what might be possible, but when someone actually wants to do it....: ( Well, early days. The other option of course (for the bulls) is exchange the 150k to btc, and watch it  become 300k!

My guess is that there is nothing even close to 7 million holders. If you have 1 holder for every coin, then buying pressure should heavily start to outweigh selling and the price only has one way to go. I think were a long way from that, but that the gap can be filled pretty fast.

Actually over time this is a good thing :) the more miners and early adopters sell, the more distributed ownership will become over time. The key point being over time, which is a period of years I guess. Until then we (or I) just need to suck it up and continue buying to my personal portfolio limits. Its a long game folks.

This is a documentary by NHK, from recently as is shows Dish as accepting btc. Im only 15 mins in, but its very factual, no fud, just telling the facts. A lot about what happening in China (miners, speculation etc) too. Very balanced so far, no particular spin either way. Nice.
Edit: 20+mins in, the only spin might be how Chinese can use btc to break free of the Chinese Govt and RMB. 
Edit 2: Its primarily still showing the secret bitcoin rich in China, and also a couple of mining groups. 27mins shows a 'secret' mining farm. Pretty interesting. The only real footage Ive seen so far about whats happening in China outside Govt news.
Edit 3: 36mins- Back to Japan, and Gox!
Edit 4/5: Theres an underlying message through this that banks around the world are not positive towards btc, and the reason there are no exchanges currently in Japan is cause of Gox (which also prevented Kraken from opening up in Japan). But their Japanese 'expert' professor even made a positive comment saying that its likely not going anywhere and the Japanese Govt should look into it. (Thats quite positive in Japanese :)
Edit 6: 43min: Back in China, and Zeta coin and alt coins. Again just more facts, but mostly based in China.

@_date: 2014-04-07 10:45:15
When you say "that key" are you referring to the signed public key, right? Or something else?
Also, in both examples does this assumes that Satoshi/I had already been in contact before. And therefore the first time I sign a message proves that I have the private keys to that address, and subsequent times I sign it proves that its actually me again?
@_date: 2014-06-18 11:33:16
Onya fella!
@_date: 2014-04-01 11:30:39
I just noticed you'd answered an earlier question of mine below too. Thanks very much!
So a couple of follow-up questions, if you dont mind:
1. If I have an offline computer running MultiBit that never goes online, noone can access the private keys then either, so from that perspective theyre the same in terms of safety, right? But the main practical advantage with Armory is the offline signing capability if I have another 'online' pc to work it with and want to spend.
2. Ive downloaded Bitcoin Core and Armory on my current online MBA to play around a bit. Aside from it taking ages to sync with the network (which Im fine with cause it eventually completes), once I open Armory (0.90-beta), it takes forever to prepare and "build databases" and what not. I need to shut it down before the MBA overheats and burns out, and have only got it actually working properly once. Is this a know issue or common problem? Or does my MBA just lack the required balls for this?
@_date: 2014-09-09 03:15:28
Who is it signed by actually? Satoshi?

Guys, I'm a big bitcoin fan and understand concepts well, but Im a complete technical layman. I'm currently looking for the most secure place to hold my growing number of coins. 
Question 1: In laymans terms, what is it that makes Armory more secure than MultiBit on an offline PC?
Question 2: (Also in laymans terms), what is it with running Bitcoin Core on the online PC that makes Armory so much more secure? How do those two work together than makes it so much better?
Thanks in advance to anyone who can help me work this all out.

I prefer to book hotels with pointshound.com, pay with fiat, and earn bitcoins! Personal preference though I guess.

The government can also make it illegal for merchants to accept bitcoin, which would severely limit its uptake. It would still be used/held by some, but would not be able to go mainstream. Just like what happened in China. Many people here seriously underestimate the power of government.

I'm buying now,  for the exact reason that fewer people are talking about 10k by the end of the year.  There will be a catalyst that starts all that talk again which will send the price much higher,  and by then I'll already be on my 2nd beer watching.

Thanks, that makes a lot of sense. And in practice the signing can but does not require a written message from me to accompany the transaction, right? E.g. "This is jack_nz, you can see I have the funds, hand over the keys bro." Correct?
@_date: 2014-04-19 14:17:33

No worries! That one page answered most of my questions in one crack.
One more though, if I may? For the Armory online PC, what function does the bitcoin qt and dling the whole blockchain play? As far as I understand it it doesnt make me a miner, so why do I need the whole lot? 
@_date: 2014-02-09 20:18:15
I agree that buying from local sellers is untraceable, but thats not scalable. For regular people buying bitcoin its going to need to be a large operations, such as the ZipZap one in the UK, and for that you need to register your details. For any scalable system, you likely will, and there will be some form of 'know your customer' regulation.
As for declaring addresses, they cannot force you to give them, but they can pass law to arrest (or otherwise punish) those who don't. And that would also seriously hurt bitcoin adoption.
@_date: 2014-10-12 04:25:31

Doesnt sound like this would necessarily help, but it'd be great if someone could develop a lightweight mobile app that can function as a node. Massive global network strength. No idea technically how to do that though.

I really liked yesterdays TechCrunch interview. The part about how much is effort involved in rowing training, then the we've put our money where our mouth is, and talk is cheap but work is hard (I forget the exact words), was awesome. Theres some real motivation and focus there, and I like it. I like it a lot.

But to install it initially I need to connect to the net, launch QT and download the blockchain right? Ideally I want to install it on the offline pc from a USB stick, and never have to connect to the net. Is that possible with Armory?

Completely agree with the article. Reddit, if you build on top of the blockchain and btc, you have my attention. Alt-coin, I'll still use your site every day, but you won't see a 'bit' of by money.
