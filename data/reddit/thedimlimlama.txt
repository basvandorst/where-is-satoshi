do you really think that things stay the same in this evolving technological age? of course people don't care right now!! but when the right sequence of events takes place that can all change. quit trying to read the future and enjoy the ride!

hodl unless you want to dump the others
@_date: 2018-01-12 04:50:41
my answer is yes but with your choices reminding me of a Lambo I'm having a no-e aftertaste.

please enlighten because I'm not familiar
@_date: 2018-01-15 08:27:12
no difference, its just what that site and a few other refer to it as. there is also the term "bitcoin legacy" that gets thrown around as well, and again no difference. 
@_date: 2018-01-11 05:56:59
many will disagree, but Trump made crypto great again. i know it, you know it, everybody knows it, believe me!
@_date: 2018-01-11 07:59:04
nah i think we can just say that we would spend it better than they would right?

@_date: 2018-01-16 10:40:16
and will be 16 for 2018 with any luck.... buy what you can 
@_date: 2018-01-17 21:03:34
that is a wall of sell orders meaning we need enough buys to start moving the price over ~11,000
@_date: 2018-01-13 18:32:02
nationalism is not anything to do with socialism in-fact when you combine the two you have the nazi party so not sure what you meant by that.  purchasing things online has nothing to do with people coming together for tradition which truly makes a nation and defines culture.  unfortunately our way of nations have been taken over by banks and debt, which is what i hope bitcoin solves. governments are necessary to a degree, but it needs to go back to them fearing the people not the other way around. how old are you, if you don't mind me asking, and where to you come from?
@_date: 2018-01-15 19:18:58

just have to wait says the bread wallet crew.... i have same situation
@_date: 2018-01-13 10:24:40
see this is where you are wrong. Trump may be a nationalist, however he is for less government. And why would you not want diversity of nations? its what gives us culture. The money we use can be universal without having to do away with our different ways of life.  i would never want to do away with countries and necessary government, but i believe with the traceability of bitcoin, we the people can make our government use a specific address which we would all be allowed to see how they are using it.  basically, I'm hoping this takes away corruption but i love the pride and passions and uniqueness of nations and thats what i believe Trump believes as well. it just has to be pitched to him in the right manner and we need to get rid of Sessions asap.
@_date: 2017-12-23 07:33:41
wrong, its just a different game at the moment and you have to pay to play right now. with time, it will be more affordable for the smaller transactions, but for now its the big dogs game 
@_date: 2017-12-03 06:42:13
i say let her do what she wants with her money.
@_date: 2017-12-25 21:31:38
ah so this is just another bear trap, cool. And if its not then we are that much closer to the next rise and rise of bitcoin.... its really a win win if you think about it
@_date: 2017-12-21 10:59:04

so calling marijuana weed/ganja/sticky icky/kind/etc is wrong right .... you're an idiot
@_date: 2017-12-03 17:01:56
ill say this sort of thing again, it doesn't really matter if you get in at 12k or 9k if its going to be worth 6 figures in the not to distant future. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 09:00:47
thats why i like bread wallet it uses the 6th zero as the main unit so 1,000,000 b equals a whole bitcoin. so basically using satoshi like a penny in USD
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:55:21
the only war is the crypto community as a whole vs bcash and maybe ripple too .... i just don't like ripple ....
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:09:33
clogged road, your little transaction can't compete with the many large transactions at the moment but there is hope for a fix early 2018 so just sit tight and don't use it except for day trading if thats your thing
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:47:39
Then Start with a nice new pair of Corduroys

its funny how you are unaware that i have been trolling you this whole time .... i bet embarrassment is now setting in for you 
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:17:11
bitcoin is first
a transfer of information 
second a store of value 
and third digital cash.
we are still in the second phase
@_date: 2017-12-30 16:23:09
so when it fell from 5K to 3K it was also the bubble bursting?
@_date: 2017-12-21 10:01:17
I'm hoping they do sooner than later, because two of the biggest selling points are at the moment off the table 
@_date: 2017-12-14 06:35:29
so you are admitting bitcoin is a better long term investment which is all i was trying to say, and yes i do, at my bar a hamburger has gone from $2 to $7.50 in 15 years and i know it was cheaper 35 years before that. so mr mathematician what are the numbers for that since me, just a bartender, can't do math?
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:53:49
i like litecoin and made a good % this year i know nothing of verge
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:54:32
watch your bcash bubble pop soon buddy lol and i guess you will have to clean up my misinformation lol, because I'm not going to stop using it you moron, bcash bcash bcash
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:28:04
completely 
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:16:04
good luck with the bcash bro but i can still buy and sell BTC so its definitely still usable lol
@_date: 2017-12-14 06:20:29
ah yes my mistake. so point further confirmed

@_date: 2017-12-19 21:44:58
pardon me... i stand corrected lol, however with the high fees and long tx/times its more like bitcoin vs itself at the moment
@_date: 2017-12-14 06:16:12
thanks for the lesson i hope your feel richer now
@_date: 2017-12-04 05:26:28
right so buy now and buy again in the dip, and everywhere in between if you can, but just in case this is the floor which it may be, don't hesitate; buy some now.
@_date: 2017-12-25 21:53:25
all i can say is that there has been a consistent sell off every year so far in its existence resulting with a decent dip during the end of the year (holiday Season)
@_date: 2017-12-19 08:50:40
i guess since all you tied, i'll eleventh this

same problem here
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:05:03
You can’t choose what people want to call it. I will always call it bcash and so will many many others 
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:52:30
well we all know Trump made bitcoin great again ;p
@_date: 2017-12-23 08:35:00
id hold for now ... to early in the game to be risky imo and so far during the 2 "attacks" there was little to no loss of net value as they simultaneously moved in opposite directions, however this last dump was one affecting the whole crypto community minus ripple for some reason
@_date: 2017-12-25 21:35:58
shit ton of people ???? nope, still only very few own bitcoin, but many are watching from the sidelines now. I'm still thinking we are in the awareness stage with the verge of institutional money coming in
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:41:55
yes it does
@_date: 2017-12-02 07:37:42
this ^
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:37:05
likewise but anything under 2% isn't really that bad
@_date: 2017-12-25 21:27:50
how does this graph explain the 5 to six other 30% dips in value this year
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:35:03
thats .6% not bad at all
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:50:58
exactly, the whole crypto ecosystem will be treated as a store of value until the volume/price swells into stability before it is used as digital cash imo
@_date: 2017-12-03 06:00:53
since the first rise to just above 200$ over here 
i miss when there was a day of the week dedicated to tipping

deadly to the bank lol
@_date: 2017-12-26 04:52:27
better yet, lets call it bcash/bitcash and get it popular as fuck. then we can say bcash isn't as good as bitcoin but way better than that bitcoin cash bullshit
@_date: 2017-12-21 10:16:24
i don't want to lose when i buy and move off an exchange or back to an exchange if i need to liquidate just in case of an emergency. its starting to make holding seem fruitless in the future

don't know what kinda person you are .... were you wealthy before this increase ? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:17:21
this has been the case for a while, you know like a week or so lol
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:35:50
we are in the second phase of bitcoin which is conveyed in the white paper. 1st phase is simply a transfer of information from peer to peer, 2nd phase is store of value, and third stage after price is stable digital cash. we just rant there yet in the evolution of bitcoin still a lot of growth to be had before it will be used for everyday use
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:34:17
Ah my mistake 
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:51:19
how do you account for donated bitcoin, for i have giving a fair amount as gifts through the years. Can i right that off on my taxes?
@_date: 2017-12-25 08:27:04
we just returned to mean from despair and should soon start over. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 07:48:19
not eventually, but right now!! I'm not saying this will continue as i see a fix sometime early next year, but as long as there are high fees and the memepool's expanding unconfirmed transactions, its a rich mans game.
@_date: 2017-12-10 08:06:41
you mean "God, I wish i had more fiat to buy more money"

@_date: 2017-12-08 06:13:55
safety deposit box? keeping the hard copy in a fire proof safe and hiding an encoded copy somewhere else in your house incase safe is stolen and you have a chance to use encoded copy to import wallet and move the coins before sed criminal realizes what they have?  memorize private key and burn all copies and import when ready to spend?

remember trump in not the enemy of crypto, its jeff sessions
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:39:58
i simply like to use bitcoin and bcash i find it way more efficient than using bitcoin core or bitcoin cash. its even easier to say than BTC OR BCH. having to many handles for the same thing gets confusing especially to any average person not familiar with crypto. and i personally like the way bcash sounds i was hoping it was going to catch on in a positive way
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:26:13
it reminds you of girls putting soft serve in their asses and pushing it out into a cup trying to pass it off as shit? I'm not following

the wallet still exist online so i don't think its the same. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:50:31
Well imagine how the early investors felt after it fell from $1200 to $280. It probably didn’t seem worth it at that time either 
@_date: 2017-12-25 05:45:19
i have transaction stuck at 20 sat/b
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:18:49
i don't believe that is a possibility. i think once the transaction is out you just have to wait. since miners can pick and choose and with high congestion transactions with lower fees won't be picked up until more transaction are allowed in each block to be confirmed
@_date: 2017-12-20 09:19:57
coinbase at anytime can freeze withdrawals... thats why
@_date: 2017-12-14 05:17:45
i believe in the bet that was mad by the mad man that will eat his own dick if he is wrong... 1,000,000 after the next halving. just remember around 2020 there will only be 1800 new coins every day and around 2024 there will only be 900 new coins. so, ask yourself if you think the interest in bitcoin will wane, because if it increases or even stays the same ...
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:06:00
low priority might mean stuck transaction for weeks
@_date: 2017-12-25 21:51:03
don't know what you are smoking but this is not a lifetime chart
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:48:20
maybe depends on what wallet you send from but not with my experiences. i gave $100 worth for a bday gift and used the economy fee in bread wallet at about 12,000 price and it still isn't confirmed and it hasn't been dropped
@_date: 2015-12-17 15:33:30
3600 not 4200
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:57:23
so make another bcash?... no thank you
@_date: 2017-12-13 09:09:24
yep right there with ya
@_date: 2017-12-29 06:26:27
be more original...... just sayin'

cheap for the past couple of days but 3% fee isn't exactly cheap
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:41:36
great example. so what you're saying is; bitcoin core is to bitcoin as bitcoin core is to bcash as twitter is to tweets? just to clarify
@_date: 2014-09-04 16:58:23
i hope this happens quickly i have family over there and would rather send bitcoin back to them. but they are in poor area and can't use it yet 
@_date: 2014-08-19 16:54:49
so in saying the problem was that hackers made an account with a fake fiat balance means the real problem is the ability to  fake fiat currency right? right
@_date: 2014-09-11 16:27:34
i second that notion 
@_date: 2014-12-17 17:33:28

no but you can withdraw the coins to blockchain then move them to coinbase when ready to withdraw to your bank that way they can't tie it to gambling
@_date: 2014-08-27 12:51:02
fiat exist, so it must be mentioned until it is globally replaced. and anyone invested i hope knows the risk and is prepared for any change being a loss, gain, or stagnant market.  
@_date: 2014-12-06 08:11:04
you need to get some yourself and buy her a gift from reeds jewelers or overstock.com with them and show her what other uses are then pull up coinmap.org and browse around to see all the coffee shops and hotels…ect that except them not to mention expedia for flights and newegg.com for geek supplies. its easier to explain as you use it then with just words after that you can debate the more intricate details like investing and the concept of the blockchain

@_date: 2014-08-27 20:21:19
its impossible to create more thats the block chain size. think about gold there is a set amount on the planet and unless you've done something no one else has yet you can't create more. the only way to screw it up is the 51%attack which could result in double spending.but its just in the programming as well as the amount you can mine each block session each day until the supply runs out.

sigh. when will authors actually do real research before they diarrhea from the mouth\fingers as they speak or type
@_date: 2014-08-27 20:30:30
i will politely disagree. one of the most appealing aspects is its limited supply mimicking precious metals as well as the others you mentioned but i for one am big on using it as a store of value for i see it only to flourish with time. and i believe new money will get in since it will be easier to carry your money on you internationally and spend it how ever you want with out having to write a letter to a bank saying what your buying and why.

I save it for a few reasons but one is so I have control over all of my money and at all times unlike a bank which is closed certain days and has a limit to withdraw at an atm. But I also have bought many gifts via overstock and similar sites. I've also financed a few vacations with it. But unfortunately there are little to no physical places where I am to spend them in my day to day life however I would if there were more options down here in the south

It's kind of like a love and marriage, they go together like a horse and carriage, this I tell you brother, you can't have one without the other.

thx for everything 
@_date: 2014-08-21 09:14:52
not sure but in the future open a blockchain wallet and withdraw them there i would never use coinbase as your main wallet only to purchase then move immediately

because we won't know when the next peak will happen, and when it does no one will be able to buy and my luck the moment i sell there going to 10K

no the idea is not to have to sell and just trade. and not sure where you get your info but there is very few wallets ( around 100,000) that have 10 or more coins.  and prices would still be proportional to each country like it is now for instance to eat an average meal in the USA is $15 compared to the philippines being $5.  also there are some people in fiat that are more wealthy then some countries already. and banks became powerful because they created fiat by putting paper in circulation and taking away gold and silver making it easy for us to get off the gold standard and onto whatever they say. bit coin lets us all be our own banker so there will not be just one big bank 
@_date: 2015-01-26 09:17:19
sounds to me like you need more :)
@_date: 2015-01-24 17:18:46
but what if that transaction didn't go through fast enough and you lost your chance to buy back under 1000… does anyone remember how fast the price moved last time and how scarce they were to buy when there on the up and up
@_date: 2014-10-05 07:19:57

thx but could you please guide me on how to collect it 
@_date: 2015-01-24 18:25:08
its all in how they portray it.  however Id rather them touch on the collusion between governments and banks and how they  pump more $ into the monetary supply via bailouts/inflation making the money we work for worth a little less every year.  
I've been working at the same place for a decade and the price of the hamburger we serve has gone from $3.25 to $6.95 so if you put 5K away ten years ago even gaining interest at my place of business you lost at min 50% of your purchasing power

@_date: 2016-01-27 18:43:51
The is an atm in Manila/makati area but I would use coin.ph and you can send them to a Palawan express to your self and you will receive them. I do this quite often sending bitcoins to my fiancées family and they just go to the Palawan or I believe there is another just can't remember the name and coin.ph takes your coins and send pesos to Palawan where they receive them. I hope this helps there is also a few places to eat uses Bitcoins over there however the wifi is not the best in the Philippines 
@_date: 2016-01-22 07:24:32
you shouldn't just buy it to hold get a little and spend it first to get an idea of that aspect. I've already taken a vacation, bought various gifts with it for others and myself. its definitly worth experiencing it first hand.  and after that if you think its something that may catch on well make a judgement then 
@_date: 2016-01-28 03:18:54

Trump. im a nationalist not a globalist. 
@_date: 2016-12-30 07:11:11
i disagree whole heartedly and think you are mistaken his campaign with Hillary's(why she failed). he appointed the first openly gay person to a position, referring to peter theil, he let kaitlyn/bruce jenner use the ladies room in his tower. and with his stance on abortion, having the three exceptions of rape, incest, and risk of health to the mother easily makes him the most moderate republican to ever become president. not to mention his stance on most personal issues to be held to individual states instead of a federal stance i.e. gay marriage and legalizing marijuana.

net neutrality is bad for bitcoin in the long run as it would eliminate the potential for a completely free market internet where it will thrive

@_date: 2017-04-28 15:34:27
again as many have said, there is no interest in bitcoin not before not now not ever. it only fluctuates in value compared to other forms of currency like physical gold or silver

my fiancé and family live in Leyte, i currently send to them with coins.ph  but i can't wait for it to become more popular so i can just send them bitcoin directly so they can just spend that instead if having to change it into pesos. i know there is a few places that accept bitcoin around manila, there is still no places that accept them in the visayan areas.  I'm just hoping this will start to develop  this bitcoin ecosystem you mention

@_date: 2015-04-10 07:05:59
this law is ridiculous to me. not being able to take your own money different places.  i can't understand why more people haven't realized bitcoin really does give you more control of your own money than anything else

how naive are you to not know the power of word of mouth and its not about just who i speak to but who all current users speak to and the spreading branches that follow. which i believe has just as much as, if not more, a hand into getting new users as the high profile integrations and partnerships you mention. but by all means keep relying on that and dismiss the importance of the current users influence. and further more i alone am responsible for setting up 5 new wallets for acquaintances in the past month with each purchasing at least 10 dollars worth and I've already been approached by other acquaintances of theirs.  I'm also in a state where there is basically no where to spend them out in public.  just curious how many people have you told/introduced bitcoin to, and if everyone would be at least trying to educate not convince as you so eloquently put it and let them choose for themselves we may just spread it further.  and lastly an average joe or jane doesn't give a shit about high profile bitcoin integrations and partnerships they care about how bitcoin will help THEM in everyday life present and future as a currency and as well as a technological tool.

@_date: 2015-03-24 02:57:43

first off no investment is a 'Safe' investment its all a risk.  personally i believe it has a long term future.
not sure about paypal.
i prefer blockchain or breadwallet for a wallet don't know anything about bitcoin core
and id be very skeptical about new sites… remember if you get into bitcoin you are now responsible for your money so be safe and if you invest i would suggest setting up cold storage for any long term holdings
@_date: 2015-03-15 08:27:14
I've gotten many deposits if used often about 35cents a week just set  it to auto withdraw and don't gamble
@_date: 2015-03-11 09:29:03
why? please explain
@_date: 2015-03-27 06:15:22
excuse me sir but i said all investments are not safe for they are all a risk and in every market there are whales manipulating but please tell me how do you know the future in saying he would lose more with this 'bear market'trend  because i for one can honestly say i don't know what the future will bring

@_date: 2015-03-26 00:44:19
over a two year timeline it has increased close to 200% fyi and most other forms of currency have decreases in that period your only focusing on the short term I'm not bragging but at least know the fact before posting name anything that has increased from one cent usd to $200 usd in 5 years

gary johnson is crazy as well, he is for the TPP and has a neocon as a VP pick. keep your coins and hope for trump which should skyrocket the price of BTC

@_date: 2015-02-09 08:19:15
xapo sucks worst decision for them to make takes all the fun out of it why they gotta go complicating things by putting in a middle man 
@_date: 2015-02-07 19:16:39
i say do it whats life without taking risks
@_date: 2016-07-10 05:51:05
wish they had voice effect that may appeal more to the masses
@_date: 2018-12-17 01:03:25
sound like trump derangement syndrome to me bud, you should go see someone for this.
@_date: 2018-12-19 00:06:12
because the pendulum swings
@_date: 2016-07-21 06:45:33
its a long one but they won't teach you this is school
@_date: 2015-02-09 15:22:40
im a new bitcoin user and using the address is very beneficial for me since all purchases with bitcoin requires it and much less confusing than email to xapo then xapo to my wallet. its like you now made us require a middle man for this app I'm sorry to say i will no longer play until there is at least an option for my personal wallet like before.  all other updates for your app i enjoyed but xapo is to much of a hassle. the future doesn't matter yet today we all use wallet addresses and you must learn that as a new user anyhow
