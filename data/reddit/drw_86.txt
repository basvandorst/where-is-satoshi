Dude try Bitwage. I use them. They are a bitcoin payroll company. They provide banking details to give to your employer. You get your wages direct deposited into your BTC wallet. You can set the distribution to whatever percentage you want. I have linked my checking account to Bitwage too so I receive 65% of my paychecks in BTC and 35% goes to my USD checking account for bills. It’s pretty legit. Circumvents Coinbase.

This is what people who suddenly become rich beyond their wildest dreams SHOULD do. Thank you so much for being a good person. You are changing the world for the better.

i heard that increasing the block size to accommodate the larger size of "confidential transactions" would possibly be something appropriate in the future.

Thanks stranger!!

Segwit is good. It makes space for more transactions. It’s a second layer scaling solution, one of many innovative solutions being developed to scale BTC. Go on Medium or Youtube and study up. You are here before most of the world !

also they dropped BCH on us during a BTC difficulty adjustment, when transactions slow to accomodate the increase in difficulty of the mining algo. They orchestrated this because they are centralized, capitalist company with a CEO.   just use bisq, bitshares, etherdelta....hell if you have to go centralized to get your fiat in then use gemini or bitflyer.
I use Bitwage to get my wages directly in BTC then I can trade them on Bisq for LTC if I want or just Hodl in my Keepkey. There are services in crypto now that make it to where you can pretty painlessly circumvent centralized exchanges.
Coinbase knows this, and is doing a CME shorting money grab using their own exchange as a catalyst for market volatility. Segwit and LN don't help their UTXO problem, but big blocks would. 
you can see all the reasons why this is happening.

Every day do it 
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:59:05
Yeah man. I had to get a chase quick pay account because they don’t do ACH or wire transfers in US. Then I started using Bitwage and now my payroll goes through them and I get paid 50% in my USD account and  50%BTC in my hardware wallet. You can skip centralized fiat exchange that way. Sorry for shilling I just think coinbase is lame

Bisq is where it's at gentlemen. Their linux installer actually works, that was my first clue that these guys may actually be competent. I never have to fuck with coinbase again, just using bisq and greenaddress, errything segwit over here. water's fine

Of course every person should have bitcoin. We are taking it al. They will lose.

I was thinking the same. The rhetoric in the thread is awful pitchforky. Not saying this doesn't look slimy. They have presumably been under a lot of nerd pressure, gotta blow it off and come back ready to work. 
Also, holy shit this ICO thing. How can ETH ever fail? All these ICOs and whales could collude to keep the price up. I mean $275,000,000 in an hour. " Fearful when others are greedy." I hold a bunch of ETH too and will HODL because I'm always wrong but this sitch is pretty sketch rn.

It must be surreal standing in front of the U.S. Senate. They are in an ancient, lofty building populated by the old guard on their way out. Watching them squawk and scramble  to understand. The rigamarole looks so dated now. Placing trust in a centralized government? Lol why the fuck would I do that. 
Their death throes are so pathetic. I don't mean that in a mean spirited way. I'm just really happy that we as a global society are squeezing them out!
