I'm not? What gives you the idea that I give them any money on a consistent basis?
This was 2 transactions back to back.

That was what I told her, go to an Apple store and they will replace it right then and there under the 1 year warranty unless it was physically broken. Nope, that wasn't gonna work for her. I think she knew exactly how the whole thing was gonna go down all along.

Was that today? Wondering if this is a normal practice or a glitch or something happening recently. I never even thought to check before today but with coins right at $100 it was obviously wrong.

Its not that I believe MtGox is the absolute "market price." What I do believe is that MtGox is damn near 100% of the time the highest price amongst the markets.
[Look at the pricing here]( - among the exchanges that have prices updated within the hour there is only a maximum of $4 in variation amongst the prices. If we remove Vircurex on account of low volume (770 coins in 30 days) that variation drops to $2. If we average those same top 5 exchanges (including low volume Vircurex) we get to $99.906 with MtGox showing a last price of $99.21 and weighted average of $99.96.
Way to busy to take the time to do so, but if I actually calculated market price based on market share, Gox basically becomes gospel. All of this is not to say that MtGox defines "market price," but all of the evidence and common sense says thats a damn good baseline and when Bitinstant charges 4% over that baseline, something is bad wrong.
Again, the end lesson here is that Bitinstant is a shit service looking to extract every possible penny, whether through legitimate means or not. 
Also, the only exchange with a price updated in the last 24 hours that shows a latest price at least 4% higher than MtGox is "The Rock Trading Company" who has traded a whopping 16 coins in the past 30 days. No matter how you slice it, Bitinstant is straight robbing people here.
edit: [Blockchain's "market price" is within $1 of MtGox's last or weighted average.](

Just to followup, finally heard back from bitinstant and they buy their coins from MtGox.


That explanation makes no sense to me. No matter though, won't be going back to bitinstant anytime soon.

Garr needs to sue them. I'm sure he has a receipt that shows the existence of a valid contract. Even without he has more than enough proof to establish a contract.
Even without the existence of any sort of contract he would damn sure have a good argument for quasi-contract on both unjust enrichment and detrimental reliance. Unjust enrichment since BFL got to borrow his cash, interest free, for an entire year. Detrimental reliance because Garr turned down opportunities to pre-order other mining machines in reliance of a valid agreement with BFL.
BFL has committed an anticipatory repudiation and Garr has great proof of it being 100% in bad faith. No excuses for BFL. Sue them and win.

Nothing is past PayPal. I sold a brand new, completely sealed iPod touch to someone on ebay, 4 months later they contact me saying the "outgoing mic" doesn't work.
Paypal ended up charging me the purchase price, shipping, and another $15-20 in bullshit fees and the cunt buyer kept the damn ipod. Never again will I use paypal. Never.

That's what I had been doing forever but switched to the straight to wallet when Gox started requiring verification.

I understand MtGox isn't the official price or anything, but [bitinstant's site states "market price."]( As the largest exchange by a good bit, that would be a good place to look at when determining "market price." Site doesn't want to load for me, but isn't Bitstamp's price pretty much always lower than MtGox's?
The big lesson for me here is to not use bitinstant anymore. Didn't work out to a ton of money, but a 4% difference is pretty inexcusable to me.
