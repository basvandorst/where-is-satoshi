I do not see any reason why btc-24 will be back very soon. Simon promised to release BTC and USD the last days already. As he did not do it I need to assume that he changed his mind and is not going to release it earlier than EUR funds. EUR funds need to be expected to be frozen the next 3 months.
Those are the current facts! Anything else is hope!

Does this mean he is now withdrawing users' BTC. Why should he that otherwise?

Guys, please wake up! This guy shows a nonexcusable behavior. He is at least partly lying if not scamming.
Thus, please let us not care about anything he is posting on a forum, but better define immediate actions to rescue bitcoins and funds.
I am not an expert but just my thoughts:
1) Funds: Which legal actions promise the fastest/best results?
2) BTC:
a) Is there any way to use the bitcoin community helping to release user adresses on BTC-24?
b) If a) is not possible, is there any way to block any transactions that involve BTC-24 adresses (to avoid that Simon is taking users bitcoins at least)

I do not know where he is! But it seems to me the most likely location. He could also be in a "safe" country already - a country that does not extradite to EU countries.

Unfortunately, he seems to be in Poland...
We as a community need to mandate experts specialized in hunting people - there are millions at stake, thus it is worth to invest in professionals!

There is no front end to withdraw BTC as promised by Simon. No   official information whatsoever.
Thus, hunting this guy seems to be the only option + legal actions asap!
