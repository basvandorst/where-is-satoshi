And you don't think blockchain get some of the fees too? They partnered for fun? I don't know what the millions per week comment referred to, it's my guess but They definitely have more ways of making revenue than venture capitalists and ad space

Poor rates for buying/selling so that they can make money.

Does not really make sense since their initial implementation of BCH for months was just a big button saying convert your BCH to bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 08:30:52
If less people use them for transactions due to cost they can't skim off the top.
@_date: 2018-01-10 16:20:08
They have partners which you buy/sell through on blockchain.info...
They also let you exchange your BCH for BTC on there for months.

Came here to say givewell and animal charity evaluators, really glad you guys have already posted it and that they are getting some attention.

No, they just accept specific ID's and I have only one of them. 
For Europe it is Passport, Driver's License, National ID card.
I don't drive and my country doesn't have a national ID card.

in settings you can enable viewing of your BCH balance, you have an option to transfer it to BTC or to send it to another address.

It's official. 100 million dollar pizza.
@_date: 2017-11-07 13:58:13
It depends on whether they moved your BCH along with your BTC into their wallet, either way you should see an option in settings to send BCH to a new wallet if you want, or just convert to BTC via their site.
@_date: 2017-11-07 15:19:48
Good luck with it, should be no hassle!
@_date: 2017-11-27 15:04:05
It depends where you live.
@_date: 2017-11-13 01:04:35
Yeah but the vast majority will be mined by 2032, 99%.
@_date: 2017-11-06 18:42:04
The best way is to move to a country without CGT

I have mine in an imported wallet and can see my BCH on there. As you have your key you should be fine, I assume taht means your BTC was moved to the blockchain wallet and it left the BCH behind, that may have messed up their system somehow.
@_date: 2017-11-07 12:19:06
It wasn't implemented at the time of the fork, they added it a while after. Yeah you could have. Yeah I would be of the same opinion tbh.
@_date: 2017-11-06 18:38:12
Well your professor is wrong.
@_date: 2017-11-07 11:49:23
You have the option when you have an imported wallet too. With an imported wallet you get your private key also.  I don't know where is cheapest tbh as I've not tried to do it yet, I doubt blockchain.info have the best rate anyway
@_date: 2017-11-27 14:55:47
Ah no problem. That's an easier requirement!
@_date: 2017-11-02 08:43:08
100 in btc, not 100 btc haha
@_date: 2017-11-07 15:04:11
Says it's in your blockchain wallet? Drop them an email about it.
@_date: 2017-11-06 18:45:32
We'll it's 33% in my country so yea, only.
@_date: 2017-11-07 14:43:47
Won't be on your dashboard. Check: "settings panel in your Blockchain Wallet. Users with balances of bitcoin in their Blockchain Wallet on August 1st will be able to access an equal balance, as of August 1st, of bitcoin cash."

I checked Gemini there and they don't even accept membership from my country (Ireland). Recommend any European exchanges?
@_date: 2017-11-01 22:10:39
The converse of this is a guy offered to pay me a few years ago for 100 in BTC. I said sure why not. That's like over 3.6k now.
@_date: 2017-11-07 12:32:37
wherever your BTC was at the time of fork, there is an equivalent amount of BCH at that address (or multiple addresses) yep.
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:56:42
I understand some of these words.
