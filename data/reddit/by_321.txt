So it's Dorian after all.

Usually users' coins are gathered into one or more exchange-controlled wallets, to allow instant, off-blockchain trading. And a user's trading account is just an entry in a database of the exchange.

I think bendability is the right word.

Not surprising at all since it's a locked down, embedded platform. Lots of embedded platforms use really old software, because as long as it works fine, there's no point in upgrading.
In this case, the problem with scanner software most likely has nothing to do with WinXP itself.

Blockchain found MtGox's missing coins.
In response, MtGox resumes trading of Magic the Gathering cards.

What does he mean by 'security' ? I don't think bitcoin has 'security' right now, at least not from average user's point of view.

If someone steals my bitcoin, it's pretty much gone. If someone steals my credit card number and run up charges, I can call the credit card company and there's a good chance they'll reverse the charges for me. This is practical security for most people.

I assume you're being sarcastic here.

Hi, can you share the source code to your web site ? I want to release my own scam coin.

No, there's a huge difference.
Dorian Nakmoto didn't claim to be Satoshi, the media said he was, and there's no way for him to prove that he wasn't.
On the other hand, Craig Wright claimed to be Satoshi, and it's relatively simple for him to prove he was. The real Satoshi knew Craig Wright couldn't prove it, so he remained silent.

So, Rick Astley is Satoshi Nakamoto, got it.

It's going out with a bang, or he can spend the money on hookers.

Terminal disease ? How much time do you have left realistically ? Assuming you have no family member to take care of, I support your gamble if you have 6 months left, maybe up to a year, but not longer.

Well, at least he didn't spend it on Magic the Gathering trading cards, that would be a total waste of money.
@_date: 2015-10-28 17:49:00
Not surprising at all. What did you expect him to spend it on ? Magic the Gathering trading cards ?
@_date: 2017-06-30 19:56:51
I kind of hope he really is Dorian Nakamoto. It would be a great hoax.
