I didn't know that about the bitcoin:" part! I'll pass on samurai, the wallet  lacks basic features. They dropped the usd converter to promote adoption or some bs which is counterintuitive if you ask me, just Google "samurai no usd conversion"

I think so �� it's not terrible, just really clunky feeling and not smooth. By far the best ui Imo is lumi but there loading time is ass

Do you use coinbase? Right now I'm using mycelium and Bitcoin.com since I can deal with ugly and shilling lol

Yeah no. There dev team turned me off with there attitude when anyone asks a question and the wallet itself lacks basic features. They dropped the usd converter to promote adoption or some bs which is counterintuitive if you ask me, just Google "samurai no usd conversion"

Brd had fixed fees and was very slow to load and no notifications if I remember correctly

Lumi's mobile wallet is non custodial I'm pretty sure. I am stuck between Bitcoin.com and electrum. I hate that bitcoin.com too change fees you have to go into settings, and I hate that electrum puts "bitcoin:" in front of your address every time you copy lol

How do you get notifications to work on it?

It looks like Google disabled notifs from them along with several other features. Your only option is to download an apk to add to the playstore version.

I do lots of under $20 txs. Not practical since I do them from my phone
