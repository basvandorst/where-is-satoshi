No, the 1% who bought bitcoins would be rich. The man on the street would still be poor having no bitcoins and no fiat.

But people like Warren Buffet and those with billions could buy up a large amount. The point I am making is that bitcoin will be corruptible if the majority is in the wrong hands. If the whole point of bitcoin is to change the paradigm so that those that are currently abusing their power (via the fiat money system) lose power, then all they need to do is have more bitcoins than all the plebs (and at the moment they would have a lot more buying power than the man on the street) to regain control over the plebs should bitcoin become big.

"It's no different than people having 'unimaginable wealth' today simply because they were born into a certain family or class. The bitcoin 1% might be more benevolent than the current 1%? It's worth it, in my opinion, to find out."
Nah. Wealth = power and power corrupts absolutely. The only difference between bitcoin millionaires and fiat millionaires is different types of wealth. So many current bitcoin owners are hoarding them in order to make a profit when they rise in  price. How is this going to produce a benevolent revolution. Just more of the same greed imo.

Not everyone is investing in bitcoin to become rich. Some see it as a way to change a deeply flawed and corrupt monetary system, a dysfunctional paradigm that needs to be overhauled. Also, people are buying into bitcoin as insurance against fiat collapse/hyperinflation which is likely to happen with the amount of QE that is going on.
