The article states:


Wait, what? Lack of regulation, i.e., government control, is what makes cryptocurrencies so attractive as an alternative to fiat.

If the market leader (BTC) starts to crash, I would think that it would pull the rest of the cryptocurrencies down with it. Y'know, fear, emotion and all that.

Should I move my coins from an Android Mycelium wallet to a paper wallet? And how does all this affect a Trezor user?

IIRC, originally, full nodes were also mining nodes, and the group of specialized "miners" only arose as ASICs and huge farms with cheap electricity made all other forms of mining impractical. Don't know if it is possible, but I would welcome a return to those early days in which full nodes could also mine.

Just bought a Rpi 3 to run a full node. A few questions for the pros here... Do I need over 100GB to store the blockchain, or less than that due to compression? Will the Pi power an external HD like a Western Digital Passport? What version of the software do I need to signal support for SegWit? Thanks!

Hello! What is bottlepay (or bottle, or whatever)? Is this good for Bitcoin?

The banks are insured, but fiat currency is by definition not secured. There is a difference.
