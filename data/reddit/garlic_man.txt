Bitcoin3 is the next-gen cryptocurrency you've all been waiting for!
With a supply of fifty trillion and a volume of 1k, Bitcoin3 is going to the moon!
Bitcoin3's market cap will soon surpass that of every other cryptocurrency, and it is as simple as fueling a bull run until the price is $1!
Lambos for all!

I am simultaneously seeing "we're up for a bull run, HODL" and "short before the January dip". I hope the wisdom of internet strangers like you can help elucidate the correct path.

The Bitpay mobile app has a BTC debit card, and I'm sure it would work well even though I haven't used it myself.
