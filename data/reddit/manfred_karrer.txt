Coinffeine is not active anymore (no src ode, no communication, no download.   
All the other are non Fiat but altcoin only (IOU is not fiat).   
Bitsquare (I am the founder) is fully functional and used since April (on mainnet since january).
Just check it out and make your own opinion. No registration required, install and start.  
It is still bootstrapping so volume is not high but if all people are waiting it will never be. Chicken and egg problem....

You probably refer to the altcoin price. It is planned to change that in future.
@_date: 2016-08-03 16:10:03
He refers to the altcoin price. We use 50 ETH per BTC instead of 0.02 BTC per ETH. It has impl. reasons as we use the same style for fiat (500 EUR per BTC). It is planned to change that in future. You can swap the market price with the icon on the right though.

I agree that most people have demands which get fulfilled by that model of centralized exchanges.      
But do you think Bitcoin was build with that motivation in mind? Do you think Satoshi tried to satisfy what people have been asking for?     
Paypal was built with that perspective. Bitcoin not.      
It was build with vision not with the wish to satisfy short sighted demands.          
   
A P2P exchange has at least in the current stage differences and disadvantages to centralized exchanges or banks (that is what those exchanges really are) but it also provides advantages which cannot be provided otherwise.      
   
The term exchange is used often very blurry.    
If it means to exchange one currency to another then Bitsquare is certainly an exchange. As well as ShapeShift or LocalBitcoins.    
If you mean to provide featues for speculating and betting on prices then in the current stage Bitsquare is not an exchange.    
But the intuitive meaning of an exchange is certainly at the former definition. The latter is betting on price movements.    
      
So lets check if Bitsquare can provide value for those who are primarily interested to exchange one currency to another.    
For those who are primarily interested in betting on price movements they have to wait at least a bit longer to get a P2P alternative.   
      
There are some disadvantages: It is slower and it is a more manual process. Also you need to install a desktop app and you don't have it in your browser or golden caged iPad, etc...   
The simply reason for that is that P2P means all are equal - equally serving and consuming. Smart phones or tablets are not good in serving, web browsers are not built for serving other nodes they are clients in the classical client-sever architecture.    
So yes it would be convenient and nice to have, but you have to decide if you want real P2P or a client-server model with all the implications.    
Maybe we get to real P2P mobile apps, but at least that is a bit challenging.   
   
So what do you get? Why you should be interested in P2P.    
You can ask the exactly same question what do you get to use Bitcoin or run a full node.   
You get security and privacy.    
   
The security model is obvious:    
If there is not sever to hack you cannot steal money and user data from it.    
If you don't accumulate wealth you don't attract criminals. TheDAO should have considered that. They used a completely pointless strategy to collect so much money without any need for it (sure for PR and pump it worked - at least for a few weeks). But back to the topic....   
   
The importance of privacy is probably still widely underestimated.   
If you have read that infamous [EU proposal]( you should be alerted.    
The [MIT ChainAnchor project]( is another warning sign that our financial privacy is at risk.   
The [4 horseman]( will serve like they have served the last 20 years. Nothing new...   
   
How can a centralized, company based exchange protect users privacy?    
Bitcoin seems to become the wet dreams for governments to get full control and surveillance over the financial life to its citizens if we allow them to continue that path.    
Matching users Bitcoin addresses with the users real life identity removes privacy and make chain analysis a simple task - and even more critical - it destroys a core property of sound money: Fungibility.    
   
So also the not-privacy conscious reader should be alarmed with that. Because such a currency will never find mass adoption.    
No company will use Bitcoin when they know that they have zero privacy with their transactions. That would be inferior to the USD or EUR.   
   
So how can P2P exchanges help here?   
Here is an old answer to an old question:[Governments are good at cutting off the heads of a centrally controlled  networks like Napster, but pure P2P networks like Gnutella and Tor seem to be  holding their own.](      
A Bitcoin exchange has to be decentralized otherwise it is simply a bank. And banks are in bed with governments (or end up).   
   
   
Sure decentralization has it' price.   
It is not as efficient as centralized server based solution but it is more RESILIENT!   
The blockchain is the worst, slowest and most expensive database. Only censorship resistance is the valid excuse to take those extra costs in account.   
The phenomena that if seems a revolution for the Banks is just because the banks have slept the last 20 years (or longer). They get waked up now by FinTech companies who are doing nothing revolutionary at all. They simply apply modern IT to the banking world.      
Bitcoin and Blockchains will remain alien to them. Bitcoin is a contradiction to their context.  
   
And don't underestimate creativity.   
We see now the first wave of P2P apps like Bitsquare and OpenBazaar. But there is a lot of headroom in improvements. Same like it was headroom to find creative solutions to scale Bitcoin - the right way.   
It took a bit but solutions like Segregated Witness will give us a basket of gifts not a one-shot result.   
Those are the true innovations when you do things right synergy happens:  You try to solve one problem and get 10 others solved on the way.  
   
If we start to explore the new possibilities and characteristics of P2P exchanges we might end up to find completely new territory.   
Territory which is outside the scope of what people are asking for today.

@_date: 2016-08-07 02:06:17
F2F trade is certainly interesting. I still have not figured out a model which really makes sense. We can add a kind of SatoshiSquare where people can arrange to meet. But I don't see much reason to lock up any BTC or provide any security for that. When the traders meet in person they both have the same risk. One hands over the fiat the other the BTC. 
A micro credit market is a bit in discussion, if that will be in place it might be very similar to a F2F board where people can match.
But there is a lot of other features what we need to do first. So have patience....

That would lead to a monetary system which is worse than the current fiat system. A key turn solution for total surveillance and complete loss of privacy. Those entities who are now the gatekeeper are at least restricted by the nature of Fiat (national borders, inefficient technology). With blockchain technology and pegged identities to the money tokens you would create a wet dream system for a totalitarian regime, in fact you are creating the tools for enabling them. 
Money has to be neutral otherwise it will lose its usefulness, and as long people can coose they will hopefully be so clever to avoid such bad money (not so sure about that unfortunately). 
For fighting crime there are much better tools like for instance creating social justice and a more egalitarian society. Why we don't have huge crime rate in Skandinavian countries but in many countries where there is a huge imbalance between the rich and the poor, like in the US? 
Cuba for instance has a very low crime rate, though it is poor and has many other problems, but seem to have a better balance and a more social society, at least I did not see so poor and degrading people like I saw in the middle of Manhattan, just next to the most whealtiest people.
AML/KYC does not stop crime. Justice and social balance stops crime.
Same with terrorism. Stopping to kill innocent people by drones and doing ill politics in the arabic world will stop terrorism not AML.

Reputation in a real decentralized system is an unsolved problem.

The security deposit is part of one 2of3 MultiSig tx where also the sellers trade amount is part of. When the seller release the BTC to the buyer both traders sign together the payout tx and the deposits of both traders go back to them. There is nothing "global" in Bisq. All is P2P.

This is wrong. You only need to keep the app running if you have an offer open (you are the maker). If you are the taker you don't need to keep it running. And as soon a taker takes your offer you as maker also don't need to be online all the time. You just need to react on trade state changes (e.g. peer has started payment, etc).
If there are no servers you as the maker are the server for your offers. If you know a better solution let me know!

Ah ok, I refer to that as triangular scam. We never had any case because there are several protections which makes it very hard to execute such a scam on Bisq.  
1. The BTC buyer need to use the trade ID as reference text in the bank transfer.   
2. The BTC seller need to verify that the trade ID is correct on the bank statement as well that the senders bank details are as stated in Bisq (it is hard for the scammer to know the bank details of the victim in advance)  
3. There is a limit on the trade amount in the first 2 month when the user sets up a payment account. 1st month: 25%, 2nd months 50% of allowed trade amount for a certain payment method. That is usually about 300-400 USD in the first month.

If a trader opens a dispute without good reasons he risks to lose his security deposit. Currently there is about 1 % of the trades ending up in dispute. Most are technical problems, problems with banks, or usability problems. Scam attempts are super rare.
@_date: 2018-09-18 00:19:20


Can you explore what you exactly mean? Triangular scams? If that is meant, there is very low chance the the scammer succeeds in Bisq (we never had a case). The only real risk I see is bank chargeback. That is unfortunately an issue the Fiat side is contaminated with. But also for that we have several protection tools to make it very hard/unlikely to happen.

Decentralization does not come free. If you care about Bitcoin you run a full node not a webwallet or worse keep your BTC at an exchange as IUO. If you don't care about censorship resistance you get better "usability" and convenience at Paypal, ApplePay or whatever.

When I was arbitrator the first 2 years I think I had one case where I requested a video chat where the trader showed me the ID card because from the dispute case there was risk that the trader was a scammer. We use PageSigner for getting evidence from the Fiat transfer but unfortunately PageSigner does not work with all banks and only in such cases and if there is sufficient suspicion the arbitrator can as for ID verification. The trader does not need to do it but then he has higher risk to lose the case if the other peer is willing to do the ID verification.
As said those are edge cases and the alternative would be to not resolve the case at all, as the arbitrator might just not get enough evidence to find a solution. Scammers are usually not willing to do ID verification so to have that tool available helps to keep them out. Feel free to suggest an alternative system if you have a better idea.

The bigger problem I see here (beside the very questionable idea if RBF) is that a single "Core dev" together with a single miner have the power of changing policies and forcing the whole eco system to follow their path.  
There is something very wrong in a decentralized system if that can happen. 
Maybe the community should have discussed as intense as they are discussing currently the block size issue long time ago the problem of mining power concentration. At the end the miners are deciding over the future of Bitcoin. Damn I don't want to depend on a handful of anonymous shady mining operators. Thats even worse as depending on the FED and the like.

Zero tx is not good enough for higher amounts but for a coffee or the like it works just fine. You are acutally make Bitcoin un-usable for a certain kind of business. But beside the question if thats a good or bad idea, who give you the authority to push in that direction? 
The fact that this is even possible shows some serious weaknesses. Mining power is sure the number one problem, core dev power concentration another unsolved problem.

Hodl Hodl is more similar to LocalBitcoins. 
Bisq operates over its own P2P network over Tor hidden services and is not a company. You can see with Shapeshift what risk an exchange is exposed if it is operated as company.

I hope and wish you are right! Though I fear there are more risks. See Shapeshift. It did not hold users funds but got forced into KYC/AML.... 
@_date: 2018-09-28 14:59:03
I will update the doc to reflect F2F trades. For F2F trades there is a section in the [doc.bisq.network]( page where it states that the Arbitrator cannot do much as he has no way to get a clear evidence.
For the other payment methods:
The request from the arbitrator for a ID is only used in very rare cases (when I was arbitrator in the first 1.5 years, I had 1 or 2 times requested it). When the users cannot provide another evidence (PageSigner) then the arbitrator is basically without means to find out the truth. So the alternative would be to leave the funds frozen forever, which hurts the seller much more and which would be an attack vector to blackmail a seller. So there is no good solution. Feel free to suggest something realistic (which is ready to use) if you have any idea. 
@_date: 2015-06-01 20:48:10
We use only payment methods which are very safe against chargeback (no paypal). 
@_date: 2015-06-20 12:53:28
It is not the question if he is smart or not. He simply has not the authority as no single person or miner should have the authority to force Bitcoin in such directions. Bitcoin will loose a very valueable feature (to be able to accept zero conf tx for small payments).  
It must not be decided in that manner if Bitcoin skip that featrue of not. If the consensus of the core devs come to the conclusion that is the best way to go, ok, but not because a single dev with a single miner decides thats the best way to go.
Bitcoin seems to have a serious governance problem.

So you assume the governments will never do something like that: All Monero clients at all centralized in exchanges their country are forced to reveal their XMR holdings and declare it. Of course its hard or impossible to verify but with high fines most will follow (or sell off early enough). 
Gold was forbidden by the US for about 40 years ([ I would not be too surprised if at some point they try it with cryptos (or specially the privacy altcoins like Monero and ZCash) as well. Japan has already moved in that direction to forbid exchanges to trade them.
Also the more Monero transactions are done on centralized exchanges the more risk for anonymizing Monero is created.
@_date: 2015-06-09 20:32:11

I think it is more useful to avoid those outdated labels which are mostly so badly and differently understood that they create a lot of unnecessary problems. That is specially true for discussions between people with US cultural background and Europeans. 
If you compare Bitcoin to the Internet and how it developed you might observe that it was not strongly driven by intention to change the world radically, but rather to fix problems like that was too difficult and expensive to communicate between universities. 
Improving communication capabilities was not a radical political agenda but ultimately led to a world where a kid in Uganda with a smart phone has the potential capability to spread his ideas to the whole world.
The best example might be the massive online courses of universities. One of the most popular teachers there reported that at his course there have been more than 200 students who scored better than those from the University (I think it was Standford) itself. So that means that now 200 times more people have access to high quality education and using that. That potential for intellectual development was never part of an agenda of the internet but was a result of implementing a few very basic principles. Principles where nearly nobody can oppose to, like improvements of communication. To apply those principles in a radical way will lead to radical changes.
What are such principles in case of Bitcoin?
- Open source
- Transparency
- Decentralized
- Censorship resistance
- Permissionless
- Globalized
Sounds like a list of buzzwords but in fact if people take those really serious they will build something positive out of it, independent if one labels himself as ancap or socialist or whatever...
@_date: 2018-05-27 16:52:12
One more reason to use Bisq. 
@_date: 2018-05-21 09:12:16
We are looking into possibilities to support F2F in future. But that will likely require that the Bisq DAO is in place which enabled new security tools (surity bonds). Once that is in place a F2F trade could be secured by both traders via a surity bond. Only open problem is then how an arbitrator can gets evidence in case of a dispute. Not easy to solve but maybe there will be some solution for that as well. 
@_date: 2015-05-30 16:50:47
Regarding Bitsquare:  
The Fiat part works like at LocalBitcoin?Bitcoin.de. The buyer make a bank transfer (ot other supported payment methods) to the seller - directly, no 3rd party included. The BTC are held in a 2of3 MultiSig (also not 3rd party is in control/possession of the BTC).  
We will also support BTC - altcoins.
@_date: 2015-05-04 00:24:06
Cool project! TomP2P and OpenBazaars DHT might be worth a look as well.
@_date: 2015-05-30 16:24:00
Thanks rnicoll!  
Bitsquare will also support Btc-Crypto exchange. Just implemented that (but not commited yet). I hope to get a fully working Beta version out in about 1-2 months.  
Another good projects which are not really decentrlaized but more in the right directions are:   
  
  
@_date: 2015-05-14 10:55:16
I know that list and its referenced in the doc. It is a good overview but I wanted to get more background information why certain methods are rated positive/negative.
@_date: 2015-05-30 16:43:55
We use actually a decentralized arbitration system. That means everybody can become an arbitrator (no single 3rd party).  
The protection against collusion of the arbitrator with one trader is that he has to pay a high security deposit to a 3of5 MultiSig, where arbitrators with the highest reputation are the keyholders.   
If the losing party in a dispute case thinks the arbitrator has not worked correctly he can call for a second arbitration round, where one of the arbitrators with the highest reputation will proof again the case and if that one finds out that the first arbitrator has worked incorrect (collusion) then this arbitrator gets kicked out and lose his security desposit. That will be much more as he might be able to win from cheating.  
Bitsquare has also a trade limit which will be pretty low (probably 1 or 2 BTC), which should help to make several fraud scenarios less attractive.
The remaining risk we consider as realistic threat is the case when the BTC buyer use a stolen bank account and the bank will do a chargeback after the BTC has been released. There are several measurements planned to mitigate that risk, but the low trade volume should be the main measurement to not attract those sort of criminals.  
Normal bank chargeback should be prohibited by our selection of payment methods which are very hard to chargeback (no paypal,..).  
Here we have documents where we try to collect information reagrding payment methods:
  
  
More details can be found in the whitepaper and the risk analysis (which are unfortunately not 100% up to date - too busy with development).
Just to be clear: The arbitrator is not a escrow which is in control or possession of the BTC, it only holds the 3rd key of the 2of3 MultiSig. If there is no dispute the arbitrator is not even aware of the trade (only his public key got used). 
@_date: 2015-05-23 14:06:25
I disagree that the market strongly tends towards having only one money. That is only right if the entry costs and conversion costs are high (like it is with most Fiat). But at the end we have already a few different national currency backed forms of money. Cahs, Credit cards, Mobile payments. All those who are in control of your money are holding IOU for you. You dont have USD at paypal you have an paypal IUO for USD. 
Thats normally not very visible as there are not much friction and problems if all goos smooth. But in case of Mt Gox it was very clear. Your USD at mt Gox was an IOU and it was less of a value as it was difficult to get it out and finally collapsed to zero.  
I think there can be several crypt currencies for different usages if the conversion runs fully automatic with near zero friction. Atomic cross chain transactions are a technical solution for that. Others will follow.
@_date: 2015-05-23 13:51:10
The more interesting part is that Satoshi referred to efficiency rather than ideology (we get more growth by giving that money to 100% of the people than giving it to 20%). And that is very true also for wealth distribution in general. A society has much more growth if the wealth is more equally distributed. If the 90% of wealth is at the 1% the resources are not efficiently used.

Thanks you for your initiative. But I think that is a little bit problematic as nobody has the guarantee that you will move the funds over to the official project. I  am sure you have the best intention, I just think that will cause concerns of trust by other users.  
I would prefer to use our general address, as that is the solution with least effort. If I see that there is more demand for your idea, I will setup a own project and link it form our webpage so there are no problems with the above concerns. It would be just a bit of effort to create the projects, add it to the webpage, check and transfer the pledges, and create new one if the first is reached...  
so I want to wait if there is real demand for that first.

Our focus is for normal traders. Main time limitation is 1 blockchain confirmation which is normally max. 10 min.  
If you use fast payment methods (payment processor, same bank,...) the Fiat side can be very fast.   
After our version 1.0 we will explore opportunities for speculators/daytraders. There are interesting concepts to implement a CFD on top with using the price feed form the P2P exchange as unforgeable data source. But thats too early yet, just rough ideas....

We have protection against both in place. Here just a rough overview, details can be found in the whitepaper.

- Trade volume limitation: Makes platform for scammers less attractive

It is in our hands whether bitcoin moves more and more into a direction guided by banks and the existing power elite or if we can keep bitcoin as what it originally stood for us early adopters, for that why we initially got excited about bitcoin: To change the world, to help to distribute the overwhelming wealth of the few to the other 99%. To challenge the century old elites of power and help to make them obsolete. To force governments to redefine themselves in a new model, not based on the creation and control of money, but on the purpose of organizing communities to efficiently produce value for all participants.

I understand your concerns and I fear I cannot give you a satisfying answer.  
Keep in mind that our team has developed already a working [alpha version]( funded by our own savings. That was already at least for me 1 year of not paid (more then) full time work.  
The novelty of the project makes an estimation for the whole project very hard, but you can see in our roadmap the features planned, and we tried to plan all milestones more or less with the same estimated effort.  
So roughly 8 milestones are open to v.1.0, which means the fully featured version operating on mainnet.   
For you strategy count also that if we are successful we hopefully create network effects, making future fundings hopefully easier.  
That first round is a test for us, but also for the community to see if there is sufficient interest in such a project.
We will publish soon a blog post, discussing more details about the reasons why we have chosen that model for funding.

Any attack would provoke a PoW change and will bring the miners on a one way path with no return. So the miners have to go full-in. When BTU price and their nodes crashes they will realize but then its too late.
I am sure the huge  majority of Bitcoiners would support a PoW change and will be happy to get rid of that centralized corrupt mining and Asic cartel.
I don't except there will be a perfect anti-asic solution but it buys us some time. Also decentralization is not binary but a scale. On that scale we get at least much further back to a healthy region.
I think the current disaster shows that mining centralization has reached an unacceptable and dangerous level. Lets fix that before it is too late. We don't need a BTC OPEC!

But Antpools empty blocks are often after a longer delay after the prev. block. So they have other motives. Increasing pressure on unconfirmed txs and fee might be one. People should consider out of BTC system incentives. Pure and closed economics is not a realistic scenario. We have actors who are not interested that BTC is successful. They have deep pockets. Naive to consider they just watch and are not active behind the scenes.

Maybe I was not clear enough, thought people can read a bit between the lines... 
Anyway, I will make my point a bit more concrete:   
At least those 2 crashes in Bitcoin have been caused by the PR activity of one person and has happened in times of economic debacles. When the fiat world is crashing people look out for alternatives and become interested in gold, bitcoin etc...   
But if they hear that bitcoin crashes as well, then this "safe heaven" is not an option anymore.
Conspirancy? Maybe. We will never know. 
At least a reasonable and possible strategy from those in power protecting the fiat world.

@_date: 2017-03-23 03:51:16
I think the real problem which becomes visible with the current developments is that the miners cartel power is way too big. That post from Jihan Wu (if he was author or not does not matter so much - it carries some truth), shows good with the comparison with the OPEC where we are. To count on pure economics - specially long term orientated - is naive. There are many other factors: Emotional, irrational and last but not least political. There are for sure actors who are not interested in a success of Bitcoin. If they are big banks, governments fearing to lose control over Money politics or those who are working on their own GovCoins, you name it... It just mirrors that Bitcoin has political relevance and potential. If it would not be disruptive there would be no friction against it. So to get attacked on many levels is not surprising. To deal with a pure economic model where miners are only motivated by rational self interest (long term or short term?) does not reflect the reality in which we live.  
Mining power concentration has risen above acceptable levels and it needs a strategy to lower that and bring back decentralization in that area. Beside that, it is not censorship resistant at all. To shut down or pressure a industrial scale mining farm is much easier than to go after 1000s of small miners who run at home their cpu or gpu miners. A change of PoW which brings us back to a wide diverse group of miners with a much higher level of decentralization is IMO the only way to get rid of the BTC-OPEC before it is too late. That transition can and should be done slowly and planned so miners can adopt without losing their investment (mining rigs lose their value after a few months anyway). But I think it is time to go in that direction.

This is a good suggestion if Core would be a kind of company or any type of centrally controlled entity. But as an open collective of developers and scientists it is somehow the wrong approach.  
Or can anyone tell me who is Core and who not? Vertainly there are some famous figures but it has no clear boundaries. If you start tomorrow contributing Pull Requests to the code base you are part of Core.  
The second part is kind of not acceptable. If they accept that it would be like they take over responsibility for the activities of free members of the community.

I respect you for all your past support. I feel sorry that our opinions are that diametrical.  
Though I am wondering why you are/have been a supporter of Bisq and a decentralized exchange with privacy protection as it's core value when you seem to not care or not understand the arguments I brought up.   
I understand the damage on the emotional side the blocksize civil war has created and I am affected from that as well. I suffered for instance with concrete loss of time and work when the tx spam made Bisq nearly un-usable and I and had to do 4 hours customer support each day when I was on holiday. I lost probably 2-3 months of productive work with that tx spam attack (leading to the support of other base currencies). 
Was not a fun experience and the tx spam was highly likely an attack of the big blocker camp. 
So yes I am biased and I think the big blockers are exercising an attack on the decentralization properties of Bitcoin and try to take over control (specially of the dev team).   
I am aware that big blockers see that different and I don't want to get into another pointless debate here. Too much time wasted on that already.   
The divorce with Bcash has now happened and I am happy that the big blockers have now their coin to apply their ideology.

Trademark has nothing to with company or open source project. If someone (even private person) has registered a TM he can force others to not use that. We wanted to protect our Bitsquare brand as TM to avoid future problems (like it happened at Linux) and we got an opposition. 
Regarding funding: We are actively working on our DAO model which will be the best solution for that kind of project to get a fully decnetralized and autonomous funding and management system. It has nothing to do with TheDAO, Ethereum, SmartContract or ICOs. So forget what you heard about DAO and take it as description only. Decentralized autonomous organization. Too busy too post much info, but hope I find time soon....

No worry it is no change in direction at all! 
It is just that the Trademark lawyers told us that we have basically zero change to win the case and better to change the name now instead to wait until we get forced by law to do it. It's  hard to understand for normal people that Bitsquare and Square is similar so that people might confuse the 2 brands, but from the legal side it seems that is a 99.9% clear case (that we lose). Also we have basically no funding to fight an expensive and long process. So we have to eat the bitter pill and make the best out of the situation. I love the Bitsquare brand as well but on the other side there might be a even better name waiting to be discovered ;-). So I hope we find that and hope the community helps us to get there!
@_date: 2019-11-03 02:52:11
So my last try:
If you have not started trading your funds are in YOUR wallet. 
If you start a trade then you create with the new version 1.2. a 2-of2 Multisig with the other trader. The trade funds are locked up and can only be paid out if both cooperate. Bisq not involved. If you exchange you have always the who pays first has the risk problem. The MultiSig is a way to  mitigate that risk to enforce both to cooperate to get out the funds (therefore is a security deposit included to create the right incentives). Read the docs if you want to understand it.
@_date: 2018-10-26 20:30:14

If you withdraw to an external wallet you see a popup where the mining fee is displayed. You can change the fee in the settings. In the next version we will use dynamic fees provided by fee estimation services, so even in stress times you should get into the blockchain.
In the trade process the fee is fixed atm to 0.0002 BTC which was a good fee before the spam attacks started a few weeks ago.

The tx fee is the price of a scarce resource. How to predict the price for the next block(s)? 
How to predict a price of a commodity? If speculation is not distorting the correct price one can extrapolate the price from the recent history. Periodic irregularities need to be considered (weekend, day/night,...) but are known in advance. The further one wants to predict into the future the more uncertainty gets added but RBF will help in such cases to exit a failed prediction.   
So instead of iterating of the theoretical impossibility to predict the correct fee we should focus on the best practical algorithms to get to an optimum. There will be much money to be made in reduction of the costs of the fees.
Machine learning should also be possible to use. 
@_date: 2017-08-01 12:55:59
Very good point! Even if you manage to protect your own privacy (though most are not aware of hidden weak aspects) you lower the fungibility property of Bitcoin, thus lowering the value of BTC. What you "win" in a few bucks of BCH you lose by a weakened BTC.

That is not true. You only need to connect to the seed node then the app is already usable. 
You only lose your security deposit if you don't reply to the arbitrator for 2 days or if it is clear that you did not follow the trade protocol.

Re: "which goes to the arbitrator as payment for their service":

Maybe someone could start a public list where people report, so we find out which banks got hacked a lot and which dont have adequate security features (Deutsche Bank for instance is super old school).
So we do rating for the banks and if a user adds a bank account with a high risk bank he gets extra warning and we apply some restrictions if he is the buyer (lower trade limit). 
We also should render a list of good banks (easy and fast to open, good fees, "good" privacy). I think MisterTango might be such one (though no experience yet).

It could but why re-invent the wheel when you can ride on one of the strongest. The size of the anonymity set is important for privacy. To start something similar like Tor would not have the same value if you don't have the big network.

We have rough ideas to extend that decentralized reputation system with a web of trust like system. If you have traded a few times with one and share your other local reputation scores mutually you could get a larger group without relying on any centralized entity collection data. 
The trade is private, Bitsquare does not know about it, so it would violate basic concepts to try to add a centralized reputation system.
Beside that reputation is never safe (sybil, long con,...).
There are several ideas what we can do once such problems become an issue (so far zero scams).
Due the regional character of most payment methods we can isolate hi-risk regions as well. For SEPA you can select the countries from where you accept payments.
A long term security deposit for new traders and lower trade limits is another option. Delayed payout another.

No. If you refer to the security deposit, it stays at your local wallet if you are the maker and when one takes your offer it goes to a 2-of-3 multisig where both traders and an arbitrator are the key holders. Only in dispute case the arbitrator gets contacted and helps to resolve the issue. With next release v1.2. we even remove the 3rd key to the arbitrator. You can read up once its released.

Good point. Though reputation is only important of u have a mass market with individuals. If your client is a big entity with maybe very different motivations as a normal bitcoiner the equation looks different.

Regarding CA regulation I am not well informed but I expect that with the decline of the Fiat system we cannot expect much positive from the system paid and funded by that. I hope that on the political side the reasonable side will get ground but it does not look very pretty. So my approach is to build something new and make the old model obsolete (Buckminster Fuller).

I think the special talent he had was game design. To bring different existing elements together in a dynamic system in the right proportion and the right combination. Specially the economical/game theoretical aspect was probably very hard to figure out and is still the part what many hard scientists hate about Bitcoin. 
I think also that he had a strong interest/background about the nature of money and society. Bitcoin is much more than just a technical achievement.

One flaw might be to think only in economic terms. There are actors who don't care about how much money they burn by attacking a competitor. If it subsidize their system it might be a positive outcome. Also speculation (shorting) might make it even profitable.  
Gold/Silver manipulation has a long history (see Deutsche Bank if you don't believe that they do it). So why assume that they will not do it with Bitcoin. Antpool might be a tool of them (though pretty irrelevant still).

No, after mediation it goes to arbitration but the arbitrator does not has a 3rd key instead he will pay from his pocket to the one who should get the funds. The arbitrator will later make a reimbursement request to the Bisq DAO. The trade funds are sent to the Bisq donation address where the address maintainer buys BSQ with those BTC and then burns those BSQ, and with that bring back the BTC to the BSQ ecosystem (burned BSQ = later reimbursed/issued BSQ). If there is a stable BSQ/BTC price its a zero sum game. The arbitrator takes the volatility risk but will delegate that to the Bisq DAO as well (he would stop working if he would lose money). Arbitration should become an exceptional case and Bisq will make it a priority after v1.2. to improve the trade process to eliminate remaining bugs as those are the main reason for arbitration cases and as the Bisq DAO at the end takes the cost for the new model we need to ensure to have very few cases (target is &lt; 3 / month).
We will also improve support, currently its a bit chaotic. Goal is that most in Bisq is user driven. Users can become support agents and earn BSQ for it. With their voting in the DAO they can influence the project so it ensures that serving the users stay the core goal. 
At a later point we might extend the protocol so that users can go directly to reimbursement, but we did not want to add too much changes and as it is a bit time consuming we did not want to add that burden to traders.
@_date: 2016-12-08 12:38:38
I disagree. For altcoins we increased to 3 BTC and most trades are about 1 BTC still. 10 BTC will definitely be very attractive for stolen bank account scammers. So that would require some additional security mechanism.

This idea is so insane that even Satoshi coded it up ;-) (in the Bitcoin pre-release version there is still code fragments in). But he did not finish it and it was more or a general market place than an exchange.   
Though to keep such functionalities separate is for sure a better idea than to put all into the Bitcoin app. 
To focus on a 2nd layer (off-chain) trade protocol is required as well long term as tx fees will become too expensive one day. Bisq has some ideas for that as well....

@_date: 2015-08-24 23:09:01
Mike, you and Gavin might have experienced considerable frustration working in that community of core developers, as well others with both of you.  
Remember there was once a very talented coder called Amir Taaki who has vanished already a while ago from Bitcoin development as he felt expelled - he was not a nobody, he delivered the first modular alternative implementation of Bitcoin.  So violations happened on both sides, they are nothing positive but an usual side effect when many strong egos come together.  
But even the worst insult don't give you both the right to put Satoshis vision of Bitcoin and a $4B market cap (already shrunk to $3B in the last weeks) on risk to a disaster. There are many other people beside yourself and Gavin who have devoted a lot of their time and hope to that most disruptive project since the Internet.    
Using the block size debate as battering ram to force all Bitcoin users into one new version of Bitcoin is not only reckless but also deviating from many other even more fundamental changes you applied to the XT project.  
The first - and for me most alarming - is the change of the governance model to a benevolent dictatorship model. Even if you are benevolent, it is simply a completely wrong model for Bitcoin. Thats not a software project as Linux and you are not its creator. Its a decentralized currency which is very vulnerable to any single points of failure, and such a dictator would be the very first point to put pressure on.    
How would you resist if the US government come to you asking for adding backdoors?  
How would you react if the Ukrainian Mafia knocks your door?  
How can you sleep when you released a new version and are not sure if there is not a crucial bug which can blow up monetary value equivalent of the BIP of small countries.  
Do you really think the current community of core devs will follow you to your model? Isn't that a huge waste of resources of rare experts? Those people who actually wrote most of the code since Satoshi faded out.  
That model comes with just an insane risk for yourself and for Bitcoin!  
Why do you think Satoshi left? Isn't it plausible to think he wanted to fade out to prove that Bitcoin does not need a charismatic leader but need to survive on its own with a decentralized way for developing it further? I know that is not wasy, nothing is easy in Bitcoin. But easy solutions are simply wrong for Bitcoin when they brake fundamentals.
And second there are those attempts for black/red/white listing which might not sound so dangerous for some people if taken isolated on its own (though for a big group of Bitcoiners its an absolute no-go).  But combined with bigger blocks and increased mining concentration that will easily slide to a turn-key solution for governmental regulation.    
Mining companies and big companies running full nodes in data centers will be easier to put under control as a multitude of anonymous users distributed around the globe and hidden behind TOR.    
But even that might be acceptable for some people in the community and you and Gavin have a long track record in that direction. That is ok. Not all Bitcoiners need to be anarchists. It is healthy for a community to have diversity. But be honest with those targets and communicate them openly.
Why do you insult core devs and Blockstream guys in an unsupportable populist style ( Those people have worked hard on many thing which cannot be sold easily to non-technical readers.  
Bring some light on the not-so-coincidental attack of coinwallet.eu which gave XT a big push? (calling it a "stress test" is a joke, it caused a lot of damage both in user adoption, fees and market cap; it was simply a criminal attack to public infrastructure)   
What is with their announced attack plan for early September? Will that help to raise public support for your blacklisting proposals, similar as the previous attack raised media attention to your block size agenda?  (not talking about the implemented TOR blacklisting, that seems to be just a first step of a "larger framework" but probably not too relevant for the moment)  
But with all my personal concerns regarding XT, I want to emphasize again: Diversity of opinions and solutions is positive. But do it in a civilized and acceptable way. Create your own network with a dedicated Altcoin for expressing your preferred vision of Bitcoin. If your ideas are good and people get convinced they will follow. There have been quite a lot of successful altcoins. That way you do not take anyone at risk. Put your ideas to a fair market, but don't use extortion.   
I just stumbled over an old quote from yourself regarding extortion:  
"Lately I was thinking about this in the context of CryptoLocker, which seems like it has the potential to seriously damage Bitcoin's reputation. 
The drug war is one thing - the politics of that are very complex. Extortion is something else entirely."  
  
To extort all Bitcoin users with mis-using the most vulnerable link in Bitcoin - the miners power concentration - to force the whole network into your vision is doomed to fail. Please stop it before its too late. You are in the process of creating the biggest damage Bitcoin has experienced since MtGox, but this time its much more critical.  
Sorry to be so clear, we had a good relation in the past but what you are doing here is attacking the hopes of many people which cannot be valued in billions of dollar market cap or investment money which might get burned.   
And consider the not so unlikely possibility that Satoshis posting on the mailing list might be authentic. If you manage to succeed with XT, Satoshi will step out and declare Bitcoin as failed experiment as he has stated there. Do you really think XT would survive that? Hope you find a better way into an immortal Wikipedia entry like with that.

That only applies if you are holding the traders funds. If you manage that the traders do the exchange directly without intermediate then its a different story. Might be that crazy regulators will put hurdles on that as well, but then you need a licenense to buy bread in the bakery as well :-)

Thanks for the clearification. I could not beliefe they are so dumb.
So any LocalBitcoin trade is subject to money transmission. 
But further you need to take care any time when you buy or sell something which might be considered as currency. Buying art or gems might be considered as well as money transmission. Of course its a blurry line form gold to diamonds to art but they are all store of value at least. Bitcoin does still not match a narrow definition for money, so its arguable if it applies to Bitcoin but not to those other types of money.
If you pay in a shop in holiday with USD and get back a change in anotehr currecny both are money transmitter as well and would need a license.

It shows how much a working communication/media platform is needed. The current systems are following the same wrong incentives as we knwo from real life. The loudest and most provocative, the easiest to consume and fulfilling prejudices the ones who provide valves for venting ones anger rather are the winners of those structures we have in place. Reddit is destroying itself if it does not manage to fix those wrong game settings. Twitter is much better as you simply mute/block trolls, but is too limited with 140 chars for real discussions.
The noise/signal ration at mailing lists and bitcoin talk forum make its own damage.
Not easy to imagine how a working system could look like but some sort of "proof of work" as it is the case in the scientific community might help. A scientist does nto get any response if he does nto put enough effort into his paper to reach the minimum of quality level to be recognised. That hold back at least trolls and raise the costs for manipulative attacks.
Reputation and tracking history is probbaly still the only way how to build up ones personal filter.

Bitsquare will support NuBits, as well as many other Altcoins additionally to Fiat.
@_date: 2015-07-29 22:38:16
There are several reasons why users are looking out for decentralized exchanges:  
1. Avoid single point of failure for the Bitcoin funds (Remember MtGox)
2. Avoid single point of failure for the Fiat funds (Remember Cyprus)
3. Avoid loss of users privacy (You will remember in future)
All decentralized exchanges come with some extra costs. To motivate the user to change from an easy to use, cheap, fast and convenient centralized exchange like Bitstamp or Kraken you need to solve the most important problems some of the users are having with centralized exchanges. The more you can solve the higher the chances for success.
Coinffeine solves 1. (OKPay holds the Fiat of both traders, No privacy protection as OKPay can easily find out all about the trade)  
LocalBitcoin solves 2. (They need to store the trade data, so no privacy protection even if for face to face trades)  
Mycelium local trader solves 1 and 2. (Centralized, so no privacy protection)  
Bitsquare will solve 1, 2 and 3. (Fiat similar like in LocalBitcoin, Bitcoin held in MultiSig, fully decentralized, no servers, no data silos) - Beta will be out soon.

The micro transaction leave very clear patterns of a special transaction. Who else do 100 tx in a few minutes? To match 2 OKPay user that they are doing a Bitcoin trade via Coinffeine is super easy. At the end OKPay is a kind of proxy exchange in that model, just the Bitcoin part is not under their control/monitoring. That is also their business model to offer banks the possibility to act as exchange without touching Bitcoin directly. That those banks will apply KYC/AML rules is an obvious implication.
I prefer a more strict definition for decentralized: Lack of single point of failures. Coinffeine's dependency on OKPay, the privacy loss there and the missing decentralized infrastructure (no P2P overlay network but servers) does not fulfill that definition to me.
They are in a strange way the opposite of LocalBitcoin. LocalBitcoin holds your Bitcoin but not the Fiat, Coinffeine/OKPay hold the Fiat but not the Bitcoin.
Bitsquare (disclosure: I am the founder) will solve both parts in a real decentralized manner without violating the privacy of the users.

As long as they don't want to know. If the have 100 micro tx orm user A to user B and monitor the Coinffeine network, they can do easily the match. They will just nto do it as long Coinffeine has not a relevant market share. Coin tracking is common place in all major exchanges, probably they need to do it to protect themselves legally.

Completely reasonable that they try to do that via miners.

Probably they only have the power to start a stupid 51% attack war. But then the real war starts where they will discover that they don't have much power really. Though I agree we need to act to avoid that it can come so far. Between doing nothing and changing PoW algo is probably a lot what can be done. Would love to see more discussion in that. But might be that the efficiency of those strategies are higher if they stay in the dark. Though that would be a poor sign if we need the same secrecy and in-transparency as we see in common politics. Something is wrong if we are on that road...
@_date: 2017-04-07 15:47:33
Definitely. Luckily those flaws have been demonstrated today and not in 5 years. Bitcoin is still young and flexible. What doe not get fixed might become a real burden some day in the future. I think to focus on solutions how to make mining more decentralized should be on the high priority for the Core developers (probably is for many long since time -  but now it is the time to get backing).
I think between current state and changing PoW algo is a wide array of possibilities. The old P2Pool proposals might get new support as well?
Hope we see some strong moves here soon! I don't want to depend on this corrupt mining cartel! That is totally contrary to what Bitcoin stands for.

Bitsquare will offer APIs hopefully soon. So using Bitsquare from other platforms should become a realistic option. That might open some interesting compromises: Web-based (less decentralized) models using Bitsquare as the backbone. If they got shut down it will not hurt Bitsquare, beside losing a bit of liquidity. So they can server the users who don't want to install a custom software and care less about privacy and security but still getting some of that (depends on the model of such a frontend). At the end pretty much what those LocalBitcoins competitors are doing.

Yes we cannot escape politics. Just because you don't like it to deal with that dirty human nature it will not disappear. And if it would, you would disappear as well.
That naive believe that all will sort out by itself by the pure markets is just ignoring reality, it's a religion. There are no pure free markets as there are no isolated systems. And even if they would exist they tend to power concentration what will destroy the freedom in free markets.  
With mining we see that a monopoly emerged without the interference of the state (assuming the Chin. gov is not behind ButtMain).  
Entry costs to a market are the main factor if it tends to be a monopoly or not. Can you start a ASIC chip factory with a budget of a few 10k USD? No, you need a lot of money and good connections to get the human resources. So there are pretty high entry costs.
Can you open a restaurant with a few 10k? Yes, in most places where it is not highly restricted with licenses you can easily open a bar or restaurant, that's why we don't see huge monopolies there. 
Beside that there is the question if a system tends to individualism or to collectivism. In some areas there are counter productive forces which keeps the tendency to monopolies down. People want to be individual and if that what you prefer becomes not exclusive anymore it loses it's value (Apples strategy to stay exclusive is an example). In other areas to have one main actor gives benefits to all so it accelerate the power concentration. Money is such a thing.  
Bitcoin itself tends to become a monopoly as the network effect tend to one main currency.  
So let' not assume that things will sort out magically by itself.
All we can do is to adjust the machinery all the time to get there where we want to have it. Code is not law. We make it as we want to have it. It is a deep political act to build such a thing like Bitcoin. To build it in a way that it is hard to change by arbitrary decisions does not mean that it is self driven and directed by an invisible hand. It is a design similar as we have in the law system where you cannot change a law just because of a special case, it's hard to change and takes much time and effort - by design. That gives the system some long term reliability and stability. Not perfect but for some use cases it is a beneficial strategy.

I would love to see some block chain analysis to investigate the characteristics of certain transactions. There are for instance long chains of unconfirmed transactions which are not very usual. They might be used for instance for ASICBOOST (pre-prepared hashes, not sure if that makes sense but those who knows the details about ASICBOOST will know), or might be indication of spam txs (txs created without intention of transferring value but with intention to add pressure on the blocksize -&gt; rising fees, fueling big-blockers in the blocksize debate).  
Also very strange that mempool grows so drastically and fast (mostly in times when btc price climbs - a way to push the price back with artificial problems?)
I am sure a proper graph analysis will bring some interesting news to light. And if not, then we know that BTC usage has really increased that much the last 2 years.  
If anyone with solid scientific background would work on that I would donate 1 BTC for his work (reputation of the person need to be solid).

Server based solutions only can resist regulatory pressure unless they become relevant.   Decentralization has it's cost and the only gain which justifies the trade-offs is censorship resistance. And that has to be applied in all aspects, otherwise it is just P2P PR.  
All those new LocalBitcoins competitors are nice but I don't think any of them will be able to compete with LocalBitcoins as the first mover who has the network effect.  
You have to be 10 times better that you motivate enough people to move. A little bit better usability or security is not sufficient.  Even big companies with a lot of money failed in that area.

If we cannot get ASIC resistant algos, a periodically changing algo is the next best thing. No? Every months a new randomly configured hashing algo. Should be pretty hard to build an ASIC for such. And if so those ASICs might become very useful for other things as well if they become that general purpose.

The triangular trade theory is interesting. 
You know that both ugly flavors of BCH will get artificial price support. So you can benefit by that. To fund your buy trades you need to sell BTC. As you can assume they will sell BTC which crashes the market (has so  times now) that is also a smart strategy to sell off BTC before crash.  So that can go for a bit longer but not forever as all is based on fake.
So then its the question who can get out before that house of cards crashes to bunkrupy? Bitmain and co need to motivate enough idiots to follow their stategies to carry the risk and to play the role of the last idiot who got hit by the crash. Bitmain is smart but do they find enough whealty idiots following their game? I doubt there are enough out there (I mean wealthy BCHer, dumb BCHers are for sure a lot out there). So I would bet on BTC consolidating quickly after some short term disturbances. Much less risky strategy then being part of a game where there is clear assymetry in funds and information.
@_date: 2018-11-19 21:52:48
They will surely do shorting but shorting has it/s limits as soon the others know. So it will accellerate the shorting expecting even more sell offs.

It's just a stupid altcoin having centralized power stuggles. People who get influenced by that should have never invested in BTC in the first place. But seems there are some so yes it has influence of the BTC price if those weak hands (and weak heads) are get shaken out.
I still think there is some big whales behind it as the price crash are so fast and dramatic. Maybe Bitmain (or some other party in that war) tries to earn money by shorting and having sufficient funds to cause such crashes. They need more money and instead rising BCH they can try causing damage to BTC to make BCH more valuable in ralation. Maybe some big exchanges are part of that game. Lots of money on the table...

Bullshit. ICOs are bad for Ethereum, Bitcoiners not affected. ETFs get rejected all the time, no surprise. BCH fork is good for BTC and no sane Bitcoiner would see that as any reason for disturbance.
But what happens if BCH whales are on hash rate war? They have to sell off lots of their BTC holdings, doing shorting on the other side to get back something of their loss so that amplifies the price crash. Speculators and weak hands follow and amplify even more. Some journalists try to find weird reasons to pour into the mix and cook up a bear market meal.
Smart investors will take the opportunity and the real brave one will start to bet against the shorters and will make big profits if they have luck with their timing. Maybe too early for a reversal but we will see it soon.
@_date: 2018-11-21 17:23:28
I assume what Bitmain and co are doing atm (selling and shorting, probably with involvemnets of exchanges) would be considered marekt manipulation in fully regulated markets. Not asking for regulation but it would be interesting to see if there is a cypherpunk way to deal with such manipulative behaviour. It creates damage to others and it weakens the whole ecosystem. Pure market rules do not prevent that, in fact they enforce that. If you can make more money that way you should do it. That's the pure market rule. Education might be the only curse. If there are not dumb weak hands who sell off at a low crash price then only gamblers who think they are smarter then the whales will get hurt. They deserve it...

There have been sudden price drops the last weeks/months as well. Usually after a day or so the price also went back up in a very short period. Maybe some bigger short positions got closed. Maybe some Wallstreet whales are doing their bets already behind the scenes and have high impact on price?
Or it is really just Roger Ver/Jihan Wu selling BTC to fuel their silly lost civil wars. But I doubt that is the only reason.

Great to hear that and would love if there would be a few hundred of others like you who can then join Bisq to do all the needed work without asking for any compensation. If I am wrong with my previous assumption, please take a minute to think. Good software does not grow on trees.

Nobody knows of course, but I think the partizipants of the BCH split war are the amin actors. They need to allocate a lot of hashpower which costs them a lot of money. They have lots of BTC so they likely need to sell. If you sell a lot in short time you will crash the market. But if you know when you do that you can make money by shorting on the other side so you compensate some of your costs. Maybe you can even win money? I can assume some exchanges might play a role here as well.
But the problem they have is that there are 2 parties running the same strategy and the shorting will be quickly discovered and then other speculators ride their horse as well which will accellerate the dynamics so that they need to sell even lower and the risks on their bets are getting higher.
Not very unliekly that both parties end up bankrupt as it is not an unusual outcome of wars.
There will be winners here as well: Smart investors taking the opportunity to get cheap entry prices. Many wallstreet investors are hungy for BTC, they are likely smart enough to not fall to panic mode.
Bitcoin as a whole will be winner as well. Those hostile BTC holders will lose much of their influence and funds. BCH will be a funny anekdote and learning example for the BTC history books.  Smarter hodlers will replace those anti-bitcoiners like Ver, Bitmain and Faketoshi.

If Bitmain does mine less BTC they can also sell less BTC from their mining revenue. So that would have the opposite effect. Only interpretation which makes sense is that he need to sell more BTC to fund his war.

My experience (founder of Bitsquare) is that people are willing to give away about 10 times more money if there is any even distant chance for a higher return (some investment scheme) rather if it is a pure donation model. There are some altruistic people out there (and thats why I can continue to work on Bitsquare), but there are not that many.  
The "tradegy of the commons" is a hard and unfortunately unsolved problem.  
Cryptocurrencies might have a promise for new models which can help to solve that. Counting on classical solutions might work for some cases but are not very promising as a general solution for FOSS development.
Those new ideas floating around the DAO concept might be worth more attention. Hopefully they don't get flooded by scams and ponzi schemes and lose their reputation before actually proving to be useful. Some of the projects in the alt coin space (like NuShares) seems to successfully implement those ideas.

Coinwallet is a fake company so they have no competitors. There are motivations behind their attack but not economically ones.  
What might they gain with their attack:  
They will push XT (heating up fork risk), raise discussions regarding censorship/tx filtering/blacklisting, let BTC price decline (very bad for miners who are already in deficit -&gt; lead to more mining monopolies) and create bad PR for BTC (what a coincidence with a lurking global economic/fin market/fiat crisis and with more hostile gov side regulation moves).
Pick any of those or all and let your phantasy flow who might be behind that attack.

I think it is not something natural given, but created by our society. People are trained from childhood on incentives and competition (many kind of sports are a good example for such an educational vehicle). But that is not be everywhere the same, at least I have seen different levels of that highly indicidualistic thinking versus more a social grounded behaviour in different countries.
But of course its sad that our society works in a huge extent like that.
Bitcoin is the best example. There are a few billions market cap, 100s of millions investment money but to fund a couple of core developers seems to be a unsolveable problem. Thats ridiculous.
But I still have the hope that new models might transform that thinking. Its definitely needed.

Centralized exchanges are like banks.

You can use banks without their awareness of a bitcoin trade. That way the banks are not conscious part of the exchange and therefore not a point of centralisation.
@_date: 2017-07-28 19:53:17
Another important aspect is that if many users would engage in a BCC exchange and move their old Tx outputs and merge it together in new transactions (or lose privacy due wallet weaknesses) this would reduce also the anonymity set of Bitcoin in general and therefore also affect users who don't engage in a BCC exchange.    
Don't let greed to collect a few bucks manipulate you for your own harm and the harm of the larger eco-system!  
@_date: 2016-05-06 12:44:08
Banks might take that different, in my account I see all those data of the receiver. The other reason is to have a balance of privacy exposure. Both traders expose their privacy to each other (and nobody else). To have that asymetric might open up abuse for data havesting.

Bitfury is acting in the best case short term profit orientated and in the worst case is acting for other agendas but not for Bitcoins.

Thanks for your suggestion. We might consider it but I fear thats too late.
A crowd funding campaign does not succeed by itself without a lot of PR effort. It used up a lot of time and at the end we did not even got the money for the time invested in the marketing for the crowd funding. To have so much effort for the funding misses the whole point for the funding to speed up development. I have seen it in this short period that the days when I have not been very active spreading the word in the social media there was nearly no new pledges arriving. We hoped that the marketing would have been carried out by the community itself, but beside very few individuals who persistendly spread the word for us that hope was not fulfilled.   
Beside that, if we would change now the rules we would for sure attract the trolls calling us scammers and thats the least I need.  
It was an experiment and it failed.  
It is hard to estimate how many people we reached in the last 3 weeks but we had 3 interviews/podcasts and 5 media articles ( we have also more then 200 Twitter followers, and about 150 followers at our newsletter. From all those there have been 55 persons at the end who were willing/able to support us substantially. That is simply not enough to build such a project. And from the total BTC amount of pledges the half of the money came from friends and people we personally know, so we cannot assume that they will support the project every 1 or 2 months.
Beside that it was an important test how many people are really interested in such a P2P exchange. If it would be finished and we only get 55 traders the volume would be so low that nobody would consider that exchange for trading. We don't have budget to pay every user 10 USD like VC backed exchanges do, and of course it would not fit our style and principles to just buy users with money.

That is an interesting point. It might have been a precedent case for a successful 51% attack, though due community consensus for SegWit not seen as such.

It also comes down to the question of efficiency. We spent already way too much time the last 2 or 3 months on the marketing and communications work around the crowd funding and running the campaign longer would eat up more of our time which we would prefer to use for development. I have seen already in that short 2.5 weeks that in the days where we have not been very active spreading the word there were much less new pledges. 
There are still a few hours left, but maybe it is just not the right model for funding larger projects like ours.

Miners who are earning their money not by providing security to the network but by external payments, is it for badly implemented time stamping services, censorship attempts like MIT Chain Anchor, short term profit by ASICBOOST and blocking protocol improvements or other motives which are not unmasked so far but which can be guessed with a bit of imagination.  
The economics of mining has failed so far.
Monopolies and incentives from short term profits are certainly not signs for a healthy game-theoretical/economic model.  
There will be some less radical options beside the change of PoW, but I think it is time for action.

Lessons learned by the miners-blocking-SegWit episode:   
- Never ever do a miner activated softfork again!   
- Try everything to reduce power and centralization of miners    
- Be aware that miners are not interested in long term success for Bitcoin but risk the whole ecosystem for short term profits    
- Consider way to get rid of those corrupt miners (PoW change, PoS + PoW combi,...)

Due request I will give a short overview about the privacy implications:  
If you have coins in your Bitcoin wallet or multiple wallets they are represented by unspent transaction outputs (UTXO) and usually originate in many different transactions.  When you send coins to an new address your wallet takes existing UTXOs and use them as inputs for that tx (this is called coin merging). An observer can assume that all the UTXOs are in control of the same owner as there are not many use cases where different people are putting inputs together to make a shared payment.  
CoinJoin is a strategy to break that assumption by creating a use case where many people put their UTXO as input to one tx thus giving more privacy to all Bitcoin users, even those who don't do CoinJoin.
Why does that matter?
Privacy is an important feature for any form or payment method. Nobody wants that all their financial transactions are completely public on the blockchain. Bitcoin is unfortunately pretty weak in that regard, specially if users are not aware of the implications and are using wallet software which does not support privacy well.  
But it is not only about privacy but also about utility value. A money system which requires to verify the history of a coin to proof that it was not used in an illegal transaction in the past would not succeed as the costs and friction are too high.   
Fungibility is an important property of sound money and weakening that property will lower the value if Bitcoin. 
But unfortunately it is not that easy to control your privacy. There are many details most users are not aware of. 
For instance your wallet might leak a lot of privacy.
BitcoinJ based wallets (Android wallet, Bisq, Multibit,...) inherit the broken Bloomfilter implementation. An observer (any full node - chain analysis companies operate those for spying on the network) can see that all addresses in your wallet are controlled by the same user.  If one address gets connected with your real life identity (e.g. use at a merchant or centralized exchange) all the other addresses are identified as well.  
I have written here more in details about that problem:
If a user wants to get fee BCC and sends all his BTC (maybe from different wallets) to an exchange he will likely merge and connect all (or a big portion) of his past UTXOs. 
Chain analysis companies will love that. They can solve huge missing parts of the puzzle.
But it is not only the user's damage. There is a huge set of transactions which are not easy to identify and those are providing a large anonymity set for all Bitcoin users. If many Bitcoiners are engaging in a BCC exchange the overall anonymity set gets smaller and thus creates also damage for those users who don't engage in a BCC exchange.
So those who think they earn some free bucks by exchanging BCC will in fact lose money as they make BTC less valuable. If that is reflected directly in the market is questionable as markets only reflect the information distribution of the traders and those often don't know about that (or don't care).

I dont have time. But hope Andreas Schildbach or any other BitcoinJ dev will do it. But the HF with &gt;1MB block will make it easier to not mix up the network. Beside that we will halt the BTC based market due too much risks. But LTC will become prob. the main market and there both coins can be traded safely. The users though need to take care by themselves.

That is the reason why Chinese exchanges dropped so hard once regulation started to bite them a bit...
One important aspect of an exchange is that if they do automatic order matching they become subject of regulation, exactly because there is too much possibility to scam the traders by tricks like front running, etc... 
The security Bitcoin has created is not used in the centralized exchange models, they use the security model of Banks, so they should not be surprised to be treated like banks. And as there are security issues those will get exploited over time. MtGox is not an accident but a systemic failure. Regulation is one attempt to make that work in some acceptable level (not saying that is good and that there is not fraud).  
How the UASF will affect the centralized exchanges will be an interesting lesson. Would not be too surprised if some of them will not survive it.  
Decentralized models like Bitsquare does not have those issues. Not doing fractional reserve banking is the best protection against such scams.
Not holding users funds is the best protection against hacks and theft.
@_date: 2017-06-14 22:42:59
No. We use BitcoinJ and as the HF has &gt;1MB block that will be rejected anyway. So Bitsquare will only work with UASF nodes. But due the risks we will halt the Bitcoin based market. Though people can use the other markets (LTC, DOGE, more will follow...) to trade UASF BTC and BitMainCoin.   The users have to take car themselves about issues as the transfer of the BTC is out of system.   
So we are the only exchange which will not get caught by risks of the fork.

Increasing the block size is a consensus change. Specially if it is to an unlimited size it will be a very different block chain which will has nothing to do with the current one. Everything above 2MB has clearly no consensus support from the community.

The Bisq DAO demonstrates that you can build powerful smart contracts on top of Bitcoin. With features even not available on Ethereum (burning tokens =&gt; distributing to all stakeholders, decentralized issuance of new tokens =&gt; usually only miners can do that). Java for impl. those is much more robust and safe than solidity. The P2P network and the Bitcoin block chain are already part of the infrastructure in Bisq so the basics have been already there.

The game theory is to simple... Coordination problems will cause the failure. Nobody know who and how much they are supporting it and how much they stand to it. Byzantine Generals need PoW not Twitter&amp;Reddit.  
Assume something similar, but even more drastic:  
UASF -&gt; PoW change because gets attacked to hard from BitMain  
Jihan -&gt; HF with FrankenSegWit+2MB (with backdoor for AsicBoost)   
Legacy BTC will die off after a while  
BTC price will crash about 90%, BTC will be highly risky and not very usable for a while. Chaos and war scenarios for 3-6 months. Big fights about who is the real BTC.   
Winners: Altcoins, mostly ETH and LTC  
Mainstream industry back Jihans chain and will lead to more centralization, which is often in favor of their business interests and makes them more government friendly, again in favor of their biz.  
Over 1-2 years though the UASF/PoW changed chain might become the strong innovative chain, but a lot of potential and opportunities got burned by that short-sighted irresponsible srategy. People will remember 2017 as the year where Bitcoin had the potential to go mainstream while staying revolutionary - though it got crashed by their own community.  Governments have a good excuse to ask for more control over the crypto space because 40B USD project becomes too relevant to ignore. GovCoins will have a good start position.   
I hope I am wrong!
@_date: 2017-06-15 00:18:11
Yes BitMain Coin (with tons of changes - BU, 8MB) and a UASF Bitcoin (original BTC with segwit activation enforced).    
Even if I never agreed with the strategy how to enforce SegWit it is now a very easy choice and the chances very high that it succeeds.   
Seriously everyone wants SegWit and everyone hates BitMain.   
Price will reflect that as well for those who mostly care about that.
@_date: 2016-07-03 02:56:19
So where is the intent manifested if not in the code of the contract. If the code is flawed so is the contract. If you don't trust the hard reality of code = law, don't play with smart contracts. Conventional legal systems are easier to handle and a human judge might agree to what you said, but that is all in contradiction with what they announced so proudly a few weeks ago (see DAO tacs).

Bitcoin should not care about investors and miners but about its security. A monopoly on ASIC and mining is terrible for Bitcoin's security. Its the level of decentralization or better censorship resistance what counts not hash rate. How many doors you need to know to corrupt the system?   
Atm. 1. Jihan Wu. Not good...

@_date: 2017-06-14 23:38:06
Maybe but I doubt...  
I think the fight between Bitmain and UASF will further escalate and that will bring all attention to those. It is not that I think this is positive (I supported BIP 149 before) but I think the group which can motivate the most supporters will win here. The legacy chain might have a lot of passive supporters but miners and speculators will follow where the they earn most. Volatility will produce more gains for them. So they will put their hash power there.  
I think the speculation factor might be very important and is highly unpredictable. Ethereum classic did not succeed because of so many ideological motivated supporters but because speculators jumped on it and after them followed the miners (IMO).   
I personally am fine if the legacy chain survives. I think SegWit is great but not worth to risk a fork. 
Bitsquare will support also the legacy chain if it will survive. Though as long as the fork chaos is not settled we cannot use BTC as base currency.
