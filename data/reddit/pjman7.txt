This is what I find bullshit is this whole property thing...
If I have 100$ USD and I exchange it for another currency let's say CAD right now I would get 132$ CAD if I choose to use it I get to buy an extra 32$ of things.
If I hold it and let's say CAD value goes back and it's 1:1 again and I exchange it back to USD I have 132$ in USD that I can use I've done nothing but use the money at different times and because when I used it changed it worth.
I haven't gotten taxed on that why should I for crypto?
It shouldn't been seen as a property its a means of exchange to aid in trade from one thing to another.

Also depends on how much of a transaction fee you want to pay.
Try cashapp by square you can use that to buy it quick no "fees" but they charge above market for the bitcoin

I have no use for yen. I believe they are trying to convert the yen to Bitcoin so as not to have to lose more money converting it to USD first.

The fee is actually .5% but yes this is the cheapest way for small amount purchases

Just because they are here now doesn't mean they will be later.
Maybe if there was a viable way to keep multiple currencies that would help too.

Maybe start by buying a used one off eBay granted you don't get the latest greatest but might give you a chance to dip your toe in. Plus after the halvening next year maybe smaller miners might end up selling the newer ones bc it's unprofitable for them.

If you have collateral like BTC in the coinbase account when you deposit it will clear immediately then you can move the cash to pro to buy the cheaper fee Bitcoin and probably cheaper price for the Bitcoin as well buying market. Cash app seems to charge more
@_date: 2019-10-03 20:06:05
if you keep some collateral in Coinbase you can easily do AHC to Coinbase and move it to Coinbase Pro for dip purchases its worked great for me.

I use atomic on Android. Its on desktop as well. Coming soon to apple
@_date: 2019-10-03 20:21:10
I guess you could keep in Dai but no point keeping FIAT on it
@_date: 2019-10-03 20:00:00
using cashapp your paying more for the bitcoin in the first place
@_date: 2019-10-26 01:15:04
Well let us know when you go by more so we can Sell ours for the next dip

Wow he is a little eccentric
@_date: 2019-10-01 06:08:03
Not good! Trust be being into crypto and living in NY sux you don't want it in your state!
@_date: 2019-10-03 19:58:37
ya all they are accomplishing with the change is drastically hurt the little people! how many of us are going to be buying more than 10k in 1 month! basically its lets help big business and fuck the little guys like ALWAYS so sick of this shit!

You have access to the key it's just not as user friendly to find.
Click on one of the wallets. A banner on screen will pop up saying your wallet is not backed up it would then go through the process of having you copy down your seed phrase
@_date: 2019-10-01 04:13:26
If not in NY try bittrix. But you can only deposit using Bank transfers which are also costly unfortunately
@_date: 2019-10-01 04:10:03
I've been using coinbase pro max I think is .25% you can get it down to .15% if you buy or sell not at market rates.

They will allow futures trading of them but they evidently don't let you buy Bitcoin and keep it in a wallet they manage. 
I even called and asked about it yesterday after reading the article
@_date: 2019-04-24 20:22:39
That's what they told me was they only did futures.
@_date: 2019-04-24 22:30:24
That’s what bugs me about Robinhood ya you can buy bitcoin but you can’t withdraw it. Luckily I don’t have to worry about that because where I live I can’t do crypto through it.
@_date: 2019-05-17 03:24:52
Why not just agree in a USD amount figure out how much Bitcoin total at today's price (probably a deal right now) then split it up according to the already planned schedule.
Seems reasonable to me
@_date: 2019-05-03 21:32:03
thanks for the response. 
personally i think its a mindset thing we as a community need to adjust to encourage mass adoption. I dont think people will adopt anything like this if they have to deal with fractions. Instead of talking about Bitcoins and a whole or in fractions  we all need to agree to when referring to a fraction of a bitcoin do it as a whole number if that number is greater than 2 decimal places. 
In places like Japan they dont use decimal places at all its either 1yen or more
Same thing as the computer world we always talk in whole numbers never fractions. 
I would never say .25 GB I would say 250 MB 
I wouldn't say .75 TB I would say 750 GB
When people hear 1 Bitcoin its hard to phathum the idea of its value being so great now but if you say you can buy 2.5 mBTC for $15 it sounds much more appetizing than .0025 BTC 
Because it makes you feel like your getting something whole not just a piece of something
@_date: 2019-05-03 21:35:39
ya bc you know everyplace else goes and sells .1 of a PB and not 1 TB hard drives right.
Its the same thing just expressed different ways I would much rather buy 1 TB of storage 
than .1 PB even thought its the same thing 
We need this system in bitcoin and we all have to agree to use it or else it may never become adopted.

Personally I think exchanges should make it possible that way it would encourage more people to buy satoshi's instead of looking at the price and thinking we'll I can't afford that so might as well. It invest at all.
I've been lurking for a few months now TBH I haven't seen a post about it.
@_date: 2019-05-03 02:04:28
Hey at least we are trying to think the same way. People don't want to pay alot of money for a fraction of something. Kinda like a stock right now we are saying you own this tiny fraction of say Tesla instead of saying owning 5 shares of Tesla. It just sounds way more appetizing right?
@_date: 2019-05-03 15:59:30
Thanks I'll fix that right away sorry.
That is interesting I didn't realize that so Bitcoin is basically just the ton of a kg
@_date: 2019-05-03 02:09:12
Exactly it doesn't look good it's like gee thanks what a small fraction of something. 180ksat would have sounded like a much better gift
@_date: 2019-05-15 18:41:20
They do allow for futures trading of Bitcoin. Known as forex trading
@_date: 2019-05-04 04:17:28
Yes but how many of us can afford 25 BTC?
