Think of mod as a remainder function. 9 mod 4 is the equivalent of the remainder of 9/4, which is 1, because 4 goes into 9 twice, with a remainder of 1.

Unfortunately alot of people use wallet services like Coinbase and don't actually have control of the wallet that sent the payment, which makes it a very complicated problem.

I don't think any wallets support that yet AFAIK. I think that is the next logical step though.

Perhaps he doesn't even know what Bitcoin is, and is assuming someone is inquiring about a classified project he worked on but does not remember.
This guy is aging, technologically incompetent, and has very poor english. This is clearly not the creator of Bitcoin.

Don't quote if you can't quote correctly. The tweet actually said "When we say big things, we mean big things" which doesn't mention anything about news or an announcement.

Exchange rate doesn't matter to the merchant. If they get paid fiat to their bank and price something at $20, they get $20 in their bank. If they get paid btc, they charge 100 bits, and get 100 bits.

The third round of deposits. It removes the account after so many attempts. It took several days because I had to wait on the deposits. Hope this helps.

I think everyone misinterpreted that tweet. It was more of a general hype tweet about bitcoin and bitpay. Said nothing about an announcement.

So you're not willing to talk about the paper because in your 1 sentence you pre-debunk anyone who might reply to your summary by saying that any reply will be 1 sentence debunk of what you said. Seems your post was more of an attack on the community than an actual attempt to open up a discussion about the issues with bitcoin.

Sometimes the transaction will go through after the invoice expires if the payment was posted in time. If it doesn't, you could do 1 of 2 things:
1) Create a new transaction, pay it on time, and request a refund for the first payment. You will have to provide an address to send the refund to.
2) Ask support to associate the orphaned payment to the invoice manually. They will do that.
And "waiting a long time" is usually between 1 and 2 days. Usually no more than 3.
Tips: 
-Don't use Coinbase wallet. It can take forever to post transactions.
-Never disable transaction fees with your wallet. It will keep the transaction from getting confirmations which is what the "paid in full" status on the invoice depends on.
-Always save the invoice URL and provide it when contacting support.

It's on the BitPay blog, so I assume they know who their merchants are ;)

I think one thing you should keep in mind is that Bitcoin companies are still generally very small (CampBX is 1 person, BitPay around 10). They are probably just going through growing pains and don't have adequate support staff.

We really need to clean out those cobwebs. That's just embarrassing.

You sign up merchants with bitpay, and get a portion of their transaction fees indefinitely. How is that not getting paid to get businesses to accept bitcoin?

It's not a mistake. It's just a coincidence they have the same name. Smoke Bourbon BBQ House accepts Bitcoin.

If you're trying to make paying with bitcoin simple, adding choices at checkout really just makes things more confusing for the user. Most customers aren't going to use a coinbase wallet to pay, so why add in that extra hoop to jump through?

I think one problem with it is providing a refund address for the transaction, and will that refund address be valid at the point the refund is issued.

I think it's just a message to Tesla telling them they need to accept Bitcoin. They currently do not.
