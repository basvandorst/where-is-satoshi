No...no it's not.  Do you work for the banks?
@_date: 2013-12-10 03:46:55
You have no clue how our financial system works do you?  
@_date: 2013-12-08 17:36:01
So...it's ok for banks to stop people from buying bitcoins?
@_date: 2013-12-08 17:51:16
You haven't seen slavery first hand.  Get out of here.
@_date: 2013-12-08 18:01:45
I could be sensationalizing it.  I've just seen the posts here about it.  I want it to be out there though so people can start taking a position.'
If this starts happening more and more are you ok with it?
@_date: 2013-12-10 03:44:51
If that's the case, you're sis has it now.  She's a tasty bitch.
@_date: 2013-12-09 21:43:51
If I were out to get karma, I would just jump aboard unpopular sentiment and criticize it like you do numb nuts.

Commonwealth Bank of Australia has banned bitcoin.  
@_date: 2013-12-08 18:00:25
Look you can entertain yourself with personal bs against me that doesn't matter all day.  The point is banks are starting to actively ban bitcoin now and that just isn't OK.  At least to me it isn't.  Is that ok to you?  Are you good with it?
@_date: 2013-12-09 22:45:58
He's really trying to pitch an altcoin he is invested in.  That is disgusting.  Instead he should be promoting GoldCoin(GLD) which you can also trade bitcoin for at Cryptsy....lmao!
I'll personally give you 1000 GoldCoins if you mention it on your show.  Check out gldcoin.com or gldtalk.org.
@_date: 2013-12-08 19:35:46
What the hell?  What does that even mean?  Where did I say America dumbass?
@_date: 2013-12-08 17:46:23
Go fuck yourself.  Try having an intelligent conversation.  This is a REAL problem right now.  It amazes me that folks in this subreddit can't see it.
@_date: 2013-12-08 17:36:21
It's ok for them to prevent competition?  
@_date: 2013-12-08 17:59:00
I live in NC.

@_date: 2013-12-07 16:05:25
If you want it does.  A lot of people would choose to have a bank manage it for them and possibly even provide some insurance.
@_date: 2013-12-09 19:14:18
Actually in most cases yes.  Double spends are extremely rare and would have to be implemented simultaneously.  For sub 100 dollar purchases, I really don't see why not.
@_date: 2013-12-08 19:36:57
Huh?  You really are the dumbest fuck here aren't you?  Commonwealth Bank of Australia has banned bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-12-10 03:42:36
You're just one more fucking idiot in the world.
@_date: 2013-12-07 15:35:24
If bitcoin becomes widespread there would be banks where you could keep your bitcoins and not access them for days if you liked.  Also, you wouldn't have to tell anyone how much you had and your private keys could be stored anywhere in the world and using a ton of different methods.
@_date: 2013-12-07 15:36:51
People seem to love enslavement as long as it's the other guy getting publicly whipped.
@_date: 2013-12-06 20:38:58
There is no /ignore here asshole and all can see how stupid you are. 
You deserve far worse names as your true intent is not to give bitcoin a level assessment or "debate" but rather to spread FUD.
Go fuck yourself.  
@_date: 2013-12-09 21:40:56
Are you still having trouble realizing there is no point to that statement?
@_date: 2013-12-10 03:49:30
It's real close.  It's actually a form of indentured servitude where the people owe the governments debt that can never be repaid because that debt is part of the money creation process. 
I don't expect you to look that up though because you're a fucking idiot like most of the fools here.
@_date: 2013-12-09 23:32:15
So you are heavily invested in the inflationary model.  I can't change your mind on that and refuse to try.  It is wrong and is basically your govts way of controlling your wealth and money.
It is simply unethical.  Money should NOT be just a temporary transaction unit and no one should have to rely on their govt to ensure their money retains it's value (govt bonds).  I earned my money and all I ask for is a REAL store of value not something artificial or controlled by some group that can do whatever they want at their whim.
You won't be asking what the obsession is with the Fed (central banks) when they start taking money out of your account in a national buy-in to support the govt.  This is happening all over the world.
@_date: 2013-12-08 00:40:55
It doesn't matter what they call it.  If you can trade it for stuff easily, it's a currency--bottom line.
@_date: 2013-12-10 01:22:02
You can't be helped.  You have been brainwashed.  Gold is a great store of value and far more apt a comparison than your house analogy.  
Entropy is not natural with money.  You are simply making excuses for the men in control.  Good luck.
@_date: 2013-12-10 03:41:31
Actually you're just a douche with multiple accounts downvoting people.
@_date: 2013-12-08 17:53:07
I'm 41 prick.  I represent the truth.

See above!  Greatest idiot in the world here.  He's like a dog without a bone I tells ya.
@_date: 2013-12-09 21:48:03
They can't drop their fees that much as miners are rewarded off more than fees.  Essentially they'd have to lose money to compete.
@_date: 2013-12-09 22:35:57
I just want to know how many SaTivos he spends.  :)
@_date: 2013-12-08 17:49:12
Commonwealth bank of Australia seems to be the first in democratic nations.
@_date: 2013-12-10 03:59:29
You have lost your fucking mind.  You do realize there are banks all around the world right?
@_date: 2013-12-08 17:50:41
It is slavery.  I am amazed people can't see it for what it is.  Is it whips and chains slavery...no.
Also, no one here it truly offended by calling it slavery.  I'm really confident there are not whips and chains slaves in here.
@_date: 2013-12-08 18:04:53
I'm not going to debate that as it shifts the point.  Let's assume all bullshit rules are followed and they still ban it.
@_date: 2013-12-09 19:03:43
If it succeeds, it will be an international currency that you could use everywhere across all borders.
Do you know how a dollar use to buy a gallon of gas and now it doesn't?  That's called inflation.  That is due to people unnaturally creating more money in the total supply.  If you save your money, you'll actually lose money.  That is the net result.  This will not happen with bitcoin because there is a limited supply.  Work you did in the past and money you saved will retain it's value.  For society as a whole, it will be extremely beneficial to work and save.
@_date: 2013-12-09 17:22:40
It looks like intelligent people are voting with their feet anyhow.  I hope Apple goes under for the type of shit they are pulling.  Their quality has been slipping anyhow so...fuck them.
@_date: 2013-12-08 17:41:40
Based on comments here, it seems people prefer just to pretend it's not as bad as it seems.
@_date: 2013-12-08 16:50:14
I can't respect Australians if they don't fight this.  They are being told what to do.  They are being told they can't use an international currency the rest of the world can.
Do Australians like being slaves or something?  I thought Australians were tough and didn't take any shit from people.
@_date: 2013-12-08 17:47:56
What happens when this spreads?  Can it reach credit unions?  I believe we are starting to see the first signs of outright banning.
@_date: 2013-12-09 23:20:49
I think you could have mentioned Freicoin a few more times there.  Just be honest.  You promoted two there that you are vested in.  If folks want to donate, they can donate directly and skip Freicoin or Devcoin.
At least GoldCoin has a distinct name and 51% protection mechanism.  I am certainly vested in GoldCoin and I am promoting it.
Be honest man.
@_date: 2013-12-09 22:21:25
ABSOLUTELY!  It is far better than having men no one knows even exist create new currency out of thin air at their whim.  These secret men can also place this new currency wherever they like. 
You tell me which one is the scam?
If you think I'm being paranoid, I challenge you to actually name the core people behind the Federal Reserve banks.  I'm not talking about the CEOs or the figure heads.  I'm talking about the people behind these mouth pieces.
@_date: 2013-12-08 17:48:26
Go be retarded somewhere else.
@_date: 2013-12-08 17:19:02
It's really the same everywhere.  I'm just pissed than any country would allow someone to tell them what they can't do.  It's real close to being a police state.
I think people just don't understand how much power there is in being able to print and control money.  Basically folks the world over are saying, "Hey, it's ok if you enslave me.  I just don't want to think about the complexities."  To voluntarily allow someone to take so much power is...unbelievable. 
@_date: 2013-12-08 17:41:10
Well first we need to at least acknowledge just how bad it is--especially in democratic nations.  
I'm not sure what can be done.  It does tell me though that governments that endorse this are not of the people, by the people and for the people.
@_date: 2013-12-08 17:28:57
First true statement I've seen here.
@_date: 2013-12-06 20:28:54
Seriously I'm so glad you responded to me because you sir are a fucking trolling idiot. 
If he doesn't want to wait...he doesn't have to.  With both services you can cash out instantly.
Also, yes, there are programs you can use to cash out when the price drops below a certain threshold.  As a matter of fact most professional traders use EXACTLY that.
Bottom line:  You are a fucking retard.
@_date: 2013-12-10 03:40:23
Try using google dickhead.  There are many Aussies reporting it.
@_date: 2013-12-10 04:09:25
You need to familiarize yourself with indentured servitude.  We must pay our govt debt off but that debt accrues in the actual money creation process.  This is a type of indentured servitude.  I'm sorry you didn't know you were a slave.
@_date: 2013-12-10 03:56:06
I'm sorry you appear to be technologically challenged. 
@_date: 2013-12-08 17:30:35
Clearly it's not slavery with whips and chains.  It is a type of modern debt enforced slavery.  I can't believe folks are ok with it.
@_date: 2013-12-09 05:00:35
That's fucking awesome.  We all should upvote the hell out of this for exposure.
@_date: 2013-12-09 21:35:36
I'll translate:
With Bitcoin you can enter the matrix through your phones instead of standing around in boring places with old men.

Commonwealth Bank of Australia is the first I believe in a democratic nation.  
@_date: 2013-12-08 19:37:49
You are a fucking moron.  I've told you repeatedly what bank.  That's just the start.
@_date: 2013-12-06 20:48:57
Emotional wreck?  You ok...I was playing chess on fics while chatting to your dumb ass.  Yeah...it's got me all shook up inside. 
I just don't like to see douches like you go unchallenged.  You should be ashamed for spreading absolute untrue filth.  It's sickening.  How do you live with yourself?  If you have children, do you teach them it's ok to lie like you do and it's the right thing to do?
@_date: 2013-12-10 01:58:15
Ahh...now your true voice comes out.  Thank you.   So folks that work hard and earn their money shouldn't be able to keep that money.  I see how it is.
We know what side you're on now.
@_date: 2013-12-08 17:44:18
Are you being serious?  You really can't see how handing over control of the money supply to some group of people that won't allow competition is a form of enslavement?  You can't see that?
@_date: 2013-12-08 17:34:16
Well I'm being dead serious.  If people don't rise up against this practice, they are idiots.
IT IS NOT OK.
@_date: 2013-12-09 01:45:47
I'd tap that.
@_date: 2013-12-06 20:16:34
Jesus you guys are idiots!  How long have all of you been involved with bitcoin?
Guy gets paid to an address he has with coinbase or bitpay then immediately exchanges if it's dropping.  If it's rising...he could wait a bit.
Fucking morons.
