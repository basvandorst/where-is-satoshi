Yea I was just checking out and signing up for Coinbase it looks like a good site.
@_date: 2013-06-30 22:45:41
When I needed BTC fast using Paypal I bought them off eBay. It may be hard finding a listing that doesn't go for 30%-50% above market value, but for the speed and convenience it's kind of worth it.

Awesome thanks guys.
@_date: 2013-11-30 05:25:35
Any inside info you can give me on when you'll be restocked tomorrow? lol
@_date: 2013-07-05 01:51:13
I totally would if I wasn't broke until next week.
@_date: 2013-12-01 13:47:11
If you still have any I only want to buy .06 so PM me if you can still help me out.

Huh? I've never really bought Bitcoin before. I'm complaining because now would probably be a good time to throw a couple bucks down and I can't.

Yea they should be in an old timey baby carriage!

You can use [this site] ( to sell the moneypak directly for Bitcoin. I've never used it though so I can't vouch for it other than it existing.
@_date: 2013-06-13 04:03:34
I'm only seeing Secondlife currency on that site.
@_date: 2013-06-13 04:14:37
Nvm I saw other posts about the site and I get it now. How are their fees?
@_date: 2013-07-05 01:49:23
I thought the same thing! 
EDIT: You can't spell Bitcoin without 'vagina'.
@_date: 2013-06-29 05:45:05
The only things I've ever seen that mention buying them direct have a minimum purchase of like 100.
@_date: 2013-07-21 23:48:53
Lucky! nothing awesome like that ever happens to me.

I remember hearing about this a week or two ago but didn't look much into it. It'd be cool if the exchange of karma to satoshis was better, but it's still pretty sweet.
@_date: 2013-06-30 06:02:01
Right? It'd be awesome if when you collected 100 coins instead of an extra life you get like .001btc or something.

[Happy Cake Day] (

Everytime I check your site you're sold out lol. What is the best time to buy?
@_date: 2013-06-29 05:17:34
You can find them on eBay.
@_date: 2013-07-07 05:52:10
I actually have the same exact question lol.
@_date: 2013-06-22 23:59:11
you can always check eBay. The prices are a bit above market value, but the seller takes a risk of having both their eBay and PayPal accounts suspended for selling BTC so it's understandable.
@_date: 2013-07-18 09:30:05
You could create The Giving The Cheat a Bitcoin service.
Or maybe a simple free to play/pay to win RPG game in which you can battle other players for BTC and use it to buy the pay items.
