To be honest the way they have handled their recent maintenance windows is some what mind boggling with what has been going on...

This seems totally legit. I'd go with this guy.

It's blowing my mind. I mean I don't maths very well but if I was someone who could maths I'd want to comment here how thats a fairly high percentage of the volume.

perhaps could comment further but my understanding is VoS has built in tools that allow you to audit your funds at any time you want???

[For the lazy](
TL;DR: If you decide to cash out your bitcoins to a bank account we charge a 1% fee — but only after your first $1,000,000 in sales.
Volume discount pricing is available if your a processing more than $1,000,000 per month.

In the early days of alt coins (mid 2013?) miners made a lot of money pointing their miners at specific alt coins on the day they were launching or for the initial launch week. This was because the difficulty (of mining the coin) is so low you could make a shit ton of them. Then you would send them up to an exchange and start dumping them into all the people who were jealous of all your [shameless plug pump and dump coin].
As the boom of alts really took off people got bored of doing this task manually so they created "multipools" to do it for them. They would just point their miners at the multipools and the pool would automagically determine the best value coin to mine, switch all the miners on the pool to it and mine it for the time it was profitable. Then they added the ability to sell back to btc for you.
Then that got boring so they started selling it for other alts more profitable then going back to btc.
I'm generalizing pretty majorly here but thats the just of it, me thinks.

I would like to give you guys a warm welcome especially after trying out opskins and having them basically request enough info from me to steal my identity.
The ones that consider bitcoin a scam are all part of the squeeker squads anyways. Rip to them.
@_date: 2015-08-02 22:56:40
They don't ask you to send them your items. You list your items for sale on teh site. If they sell, then once the other party has transfered the BTC then you get a trade request for their bot. You then give up the items and get back to BTC. You have noticed that buying in the steam store costs 15% right?
@_date: 2015-08-02 22:47:40
After attempting to sign up for opskin's and facing their [absolutely ridiculous terms for proof of identity]( 
TL;DR we are talking about them asking me to provide them more information then any bitcoin exchange that wants to connect to my bank account has ever asked for. Not to mention they are doing it from some web based CMS with no SSL certificate? Maybe these guys know Karpeles? 
After that experience I had a horrible taste in my mouth. I was left thinking how in this world when a technology like bitcoin exists or keybase.io is some company asking me for proof of identity via Government issued ID, a utility bill with matching address and then two other forms of proof just to take my money? With no SSL? 
Thank you, thank you, thank you! 
I have already listed some items and look forward to now dropping some bitcoin!
