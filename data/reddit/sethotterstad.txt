The vast majority of people believe it is moral to use government force to take away the freedom of people who break laws.  So that is how things are.  Control of the money supply has almost nothing to do with this.  There are dozens of countries that don't have monetary sovereignty, including most of the European Union, Ecuador, Panama, etc, and nation-states are doing just fine there.

One way you could greatly improve on coinmap would be to add filters.  The most important ones would be places that sell food, such as restaurants and bars, and lodging/hotels.  The BitMap app for android has restaurants shown as a different color, and AirBitz allows you to search for "food", "hotel", etc.

There already exist dozens of countries that transact in currencies they cannot print.  For example, Panama's national currency is the USD, which it cannot print.  When they want to spend money they don't have, they hold an auction on the open market, just like every other country does.  Bidders demand an interest rate to loan money to Panama, depending on its perceived risk of default.  This process would be the same even if they were transacting in bitcoin.  Panama would just go on the open market to loan some bitcoin to spend.  You should spend some time learning basic economics.  Khan Academy is a good place to start.  Start with this video:

In the bitcoin space, we've got exchanges doing 500m thefts, tons of exchanges using fractional reserve, BTC-e running with completely anonymous owners, huge ponzi schemes like BS&amp;T, most users using a centralized service like Coinbase or Circle that could easily be fractional reserve just like MtGox, and even exchanges that pass "proof-of-reserves" can be borrowing bitcoin to give themselves 100% reserves during the audit.
If bitcoiners themselves don't even bother to transact on the blockchain or hold their own funds, where are you getting this idea that there will be such competition for a monopoly entity like a government to pressure it to use bitcoin to transact with?

This idea that bitcoin is immune to taxation is ridiculous.  Income tax, property tax, sales tax etc can all be collected just as easily in a world using bitcoin.  Additionally, governments can mandate that prices must be set in an inflationary currency.  People can immediately convert to bitcoin, but they could always do that with gold to avoid inflation as well.

Try going to Argentina and listing your prices in USD or Bitcoin.  It's illegal so people don't do it.  The government can even get away with saying you must transact in Argentine pesos.  If you sell your house and accept dollars instead of pesos you can go to jail, so buyers convert their dollars into pesos to buy the house, and then the seller converts back to dollars.
If you are dealing in entirely digital goods and services with no ties to the real world, you might get away without paying any tax, but that is a very tiny percentage of commerce, and it will still be illegal and you can still go to jail like Ross Ulbricht.

I, along with most Americans, am perfectly fine with using government force to compel people to quit stealing, driving 100mph, and funding terrorism.  Loss of control of the money supply is not going to have any effect on this, just like it didn't have any effect on Italy or any other nation that joined the EU and lost the ability to control their money supply.

Luke, I'm curious what the current cost is for miners to include a transaction in a block.  The last estimate I saw was 41 cents here:  
@_date: 2015-06-25 23:44:33
You claimed I am "grossly underestimating how much of their spending and taxing power is derived from inflation"
There is certainly SOME loss of power by giving up monetary soverignty, but you and the author of this article just don't seem to have a handle on how much power it is.  Due to the power loss, nation-states don't run around giving up their monetary sovereignty willy-nilly.  For example, EU nations have to see some upside to join the EU and give up their ability to print their own currency, and the UK still doesn't see enough upside to bother giving up the power and joining the currency union.  
So there is some power loss, but it's small enough that an upside like establishing a free-trade zone or a mutual defense pact is usually enough to offset it and make it worthwhile to give up.  This idea that the loss of power is so large that it will "end the nation state", as proposed in the article, is preposterous.  Governments under the gold standard or that have given up their ability to print money are almost as powerful as ones that can print.
Then you've got a secondary argument going about how governments and banks are going to be forced to use bitcoin and do all their transacting on the blockchain, which will end FRB, loans, and spending before taxing.  You claimed that "the inability to spend without taxing first will have a massive impact on limiting what government institutions can get away with."
This argument is even more ridiculous than the first one, and I shouldn't have responded to it earlier because I did not notice it mentioned in the original article.

There are dozens of countries that don't have monetary sovereignty, including most of the European Union, Ecuador, Panama, etc.  This doesn't cause them to lose the ability to spend before they tax, and it doesn't end FRB or loans or anything else you state.

The free market always chooses fractional reserve.  Banks that accept gold for deposit are fractional reserve too.  Banks in Panama, which can't print it's own currency, are fractional reserve too.  Austrians who rail against fractional reserve are typically unaware of any new economic thought from the last 50 years, including the work of Austrians like George Selgin, who has two main arguments:
1) We have 100%-reserve banking options right now; they are called safety deposit boxes.  For centuries, free markets have had little interest in 100%-reserve banking because people do not want to pay to store their money.   Bitcoin could possibly change the playing field enough to make 100%-reserve more competitive because its storage costs are relatively low, but most folks will still choose to accept an interest rate instead.
2) "On demand" fractional-reserve deposits are not fraudulent and are legal in a free-banking Austrian utopia, in the same way that an insurance company does not commit fraud despite the inability to pay out if all policyholders file a claim at once.  Depositors accept risk and acknowledge that their deposit is lent out by accepting interest.  Depositors would need to be near brain-dead to think the bank was paying them to just sit on their money.
Here is a short article that explains it further:

Most important part:
"....Should cryptocurrencies gain prominence in a country's economy to the point that they undermine a central bank's monetary policy, the government of that country would have a problem. Jeopardizing one of the primary methods a nation-state uses to direct its economy -- and finance its government -- is unacceptable to any authority. By then, assuming a broad citizen investment in the new currency, any attempt to outlaw it or affect the exchanges would be politically difficult, leading to social tension, even unrest.
A more likely government strategy to circumvent the impact of digital currencies and preserve the integrity of the treasury would be to employ pre-emptive action at the emergence of cryptocurrency, most likely through regulating the online exchanges. Such regulation would allow government officials to identify online accounts, make connections and thus limit or monitor tax evasion and other illicit activity. Bitcoins are incredibly transparent. Tracking money-flow using the blockchain is just one method agencies may already be using to monitor illegal activities."

Minute 45:12 is also interesting, but not Bitcoin related.
Moderator:  So where should people be putting their money?  Should they be selling their shares of Bank of America?  Should they be an angel investor?
David Teten, ff Venture Capital:  ....Angel investing has median returns of 18-54%, according to 12 different studies that we've collected.  So it's the highest performing asset class that I'm aware of.  But there's a catch:  It's highly illiquid, and most of the companies you put money into will die and go to zero. 
So it's only an attractive asset class if you do it with some scale, minimum 10 investments, and if you apply some time and energy to it, so it's a lot more work than just calling up your friendly broker and putting a million dollars  into a stock.  So we think it's a really attractive asset class that is under-allocated to....
There are 5.1m accredited investors in America.  Only 5% of them have made an angel investment in the last 2 years.  So the problem is that the traditional financial services industry doesn't make money on angel investing.  They want you to put money into mutual funds and hedge funds and your bank and whatnot where they make a fee.  They don't want you to put money directly into a small startup where they don't make a fee.  So there's something of an institutional bias against this asset class....

Comparing bank energy usage to bitcoin mining is meaningless because bitcoin is not in direct competition with banks and will not replace banks.  The main way that banks make money is by loaning out customer deposits, and they will accept bitcoin deposits to loan out as soon as there is demand.  We have already seen two banks announce partnerships with bitcoin exchanges.  The banks do stand to lose money in certain areas such as wire fees and currency conversion fees, but these are a small fraction of their income, and there are a dozen other startups working on disrupting this area because everyone knows the current fee model is not sustainable.
The most relevant thing against which to compare bitcoin's energy usage is the energy usage from gold mining, transportation, and storage.  You might also compare it against the energy cost of running the FED or the ECB and their respective paper monies.

[53:52] Moderator:  The security concern is one that I hear all the time about emerging markets, but they don't have a choice!  They don't have that alternative of getting to go to a bank in many places around the world.
Arjuna Costa:  And they start with the deep distrust of banks.
Moderator:  Is that just a historical legacy?
Arjuna Costa:  It's [that] either most of the banks were government owned and the minister of finance funded his pet project with it and the bank went bankrupt with no deposit insurance.  Or there's been waves of hyperinflation where that $100 you put in the bank doesn't exist when you come back six months from now.  Or you put $100 in and didn't read the fine print that showed a monthly maintenance fee of $5 and you come back a year later and there's nothing left and they say "well you didn't read the fine print."  So the mass market doesn't trust the banks.
Moderator:  So that's a huge advantage for somebody else offering a new financial service.
Arjuna Costa:  And there's a big cultural gap in these markets.  If you're a banker who puts on a suit and tie to go to work, you've left 80% of the population behind.  They just don't feel welcome in banks.  The bankers don't want them, and they don't feel welcome in banks.  If we think about the long term growth of the consumer in emerging markets, it just doesn't seem to be in the DNA of the banks to serve them.  So I think you're going to have to build the trust and the brand, and be vigilant about security, but for this part of the client base, you're not competing with the banks.  
Moderator:  That's fascinating.  It's a failure of the banks to move into this very growing space.
Arjuna Costa:  It's aspiring middle class and small businesses that are going to be the engine of growth in these markets.  Both of those are classes or organizations of people that the banks don't get.

"We believe the most significant long-term application of bitcoin may be reducing the upfront cost of internet-connected devices to make them more accessible for the developing world."
It looks to me like they are going to subsidize routers and other hardware for third world people and let them pay it off over 10 years at a 5x markup on their power bill.

SPV users such as myself will immediately switch back to using a full node if it ever appears that we might lose coins.  So far, I have not heard about anyone getting ripped off due to using SPV.

You're right, looks like they added some to the UK and US after I wrote the post, making Brazil  although some of the stuff looks questionable.  For example, Bitstamp is based in Slovenia, not the UK.

This is the payment terminal Cafe Kobalt is using.  Does anyone know what it is?

I realize their listed address is the UK, but it's just a mailbox.  The company is based in Slovenia.

The notes on the Wikipedia page for Bitstamp are about right.  The company moved its registration to the UK, but their whole team lives in Slovenia, as you can verify by asking them when they appear at conferences.

You could work for an employer who will give you food and housing and a car if you want, but everyone thinks it's better to work in exchange for more numbers in the database, which are favor vouchers.  You can trade them in for whatever you want whenever you want.

Deposits were added a year ago.  Withdrawals are new.

Good to see Selgin getting some publicity.  Most Austrians are unaware of him, which is a shame since he is the only Austrian who has made any sort of contribution to economic thought in the last 50 years.  He's much more academic and unconcerned with what all the idiot armchair Austrians think.  For example, he debunks the position that Fractional Reserve Banking is fraudulent in this article:
Make sure to read the comments.  Some of the best info is there.

Can someone please outline the available methods for trading in and out of bitcoin in Ukraine, and the fees for doing so (especially if the method is an ATM)?

It's very annoying when bitcoiners upvote a thread with faulty economic logic in the title.

Despite the current optimism on reddit, it is absurd to believe that Jihan will ever willingly activate segregated witness because it isn't compatible with his patented asicboost advantage.  Bitfury, Slush, F2pool, and whoever else can start signaling, and it won't matter because other hashpower will magically stop signaling and bip91 will never lock in.  Watch and see.

Many of your sentences are full of errors and don't make any sense because you don't have a basic understanding of economics, and it's embarrassing that so many bitcoiners have upvoted this.  Please learn the basics before making more posts.  Khan Academy is a good place to start:
Saving under a mattress is generally a bad idea, regardless of the rate of inflation or deflation.  You can go buy gold and save it under a mattress, and in 100 years, it will buy about the same amount.  If you invested in productive assets such as the US stock market over the previous 100 years, you would have gained 1 million percent.

If there had been deflation over the same period of time, the average worker would have experienced a pay cut or a layoff instead of a stagnant wage.
