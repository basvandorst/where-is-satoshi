Thanks for your condescension. Do you communicate your knowledge like that in meatspace? You must be a pleasure to be around. 
Regardless, I'll engage you as a fellow human being, even though you didn't give me the same respect.
If a thief breaks into my house and finds a list of 24 words, he can pretty easily guess, even with a Google search,  what those words represent, especially since those words are tucked away with other valuable things like passports,  birth certificates, and titles. 
Now,  if a thief breaks in and finds a list of 200 random words laying around together with the junk on my desk,  and finds the same list of words maybe in my dresser drawer, what can he realistically conclude that it is? 
Alternativrly, if a thief breaks in and funds a book with highlighted words, what will he conclude? What if entire sentences are highlighted. Or hundreds of words. 
Thoughts?

Or you can obfuscate the seed and leave it in plain sight. It's just a bunch of words, right? Would those words stand out when embedded in other words?

You shouldn't reject stereotypes by default. It seems to me that stereotypes can be rooted in some truthful observation.
Note that maleness doesn't denote having a penis, nor femaleness having a vagina. There can be relationships where the "spiritual male" is the biological female, and vice versa.

I don't buy this "attack" narrative. How is bitcoin being attacked?
Do you mean spam transactions? Spam transactions are by definition low fee. Low fee transactions don't affect the price of fees. It's people out bidding themselves on fees by attempting to transact that create the fee market. Only the top layer of transactions with the highest fees get mined. Miners are not even getting to the spam transactions. We're choking because blocks are full. Blocks are full because bitcoin has outgrown its blovksize ceiling. Again, only legit transactions are being mined. Blocks are full even if you ignore spam. Do you see?
Or maybe by attack you mean the two prongs competing for hash power? This is not an attack, but the normal working of economic incentives. Miners are supposed to be greedy. So, if something else is more profitable, they will mine that. This is normal and in fact required. If such incentives were not in place, first gen blockchains with POW mining would be fundamentally flawed.
So... What attack? 
@_date: 2017-11-04 04:20:10
You're not saying much of anything for me to understand. You're handwaiving and being angry.
What do you mean by changing PoW to 2x? 2x is talking about changing the hashing algorithm?
I subscribe to both and I don't deny there are malicious actors. Such is life. There are malicious actors on all sides. It's a wash. It doesn't matter. Consensus will emerge, and whatever emerges will be good. If it's not, then the Economic incentive structure underpinning first generation blockchains is flawed. 
I'm not convinced you understand the principle of emergent consensus underpinning blockchains, which is why I continue to point at that. 
What do you think is best for bitcoin? Forget everything and think for yourself. Blocks are full. Fees are high.
I, for one, find that annoying. It stops me from moving my coins. That's not a good characteristic for currency to have. I believe 2x will alleviate this in the short to medium term. Then, we will see where to go in the future. 
I do not think there's any danger with 2mb blocks. The 1mb limit was arbitrary. There is no reason to keep it at that now that the network is at capacity. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 00:55:25

@_date: 2017-11-15 04:10:10
That's interesting about Garzik. I wonder what his motivations are.
Consider that a miner's fundamental motivation is to make money. One way they make money is to increase the value of bitcoin, so that their block rewards are worth more in fiat. 
Bitcoin with high fees and slow confirmations utterly kills adoption. I can't buy anything with bitcoin right now, not realistically. That simply fucking sucks. This is why I support bigger blocks. It's the obvious solution to an immediate problem, and it is easily doable. This particular incarnation of bigger blocks (BCH) comes with Asicboost which Chinese miners use to reduce costs and make more money. It would by hypocritical of me to fault them for that. 
Miner greed is a foundational economic incentive of bitcoin. Without it, the whole thing doesn't work.
That said, I love the ethos of fully decentralized mining, a la the CPU mining of infant bitcoin. GPU mining approaches that, but it's not the same. Big mining farms still centralize around cheap power, although i don't recall any stories about massive GPU farms in China, only ASICs.. I haven't looked to closely into BTG, but I like the idea. I'm holding and not itching to sell. Winter is coming, and I might even fire up an old 4 GPU rig and try mining it. I wish the chain luck. It might have a place.
@_date: 2017-11-14 22:26:21
Where were KNCs chips actually being produced? In Scandanavia? I think not.  Butterfly was a joke. Did you ever get your jalapeño? I sure as hell never did. I very much doubt they were manufactured anywhere other than China, but I'd have to look into it. 
Find anything electronic in your house that's not made in Asia. Report back your findings. 
I'm not afraid to talk about asicboost. I just think you're wrong. You found a boogeyman. Mining fundamentally coalesces around cheap power. This is why McAfees mining operation is in the pacific northwest. Electricity is the primary cost. I know a bit about it. I ran 40 GPUs right before the first ASICs were being released, and was able to mine sha256 before switching to scrypt. I also had ASICMINER shares. 
I remember that KNCs statement, and at that time, I interpreted it as meaning cheap electricity, possibly even subsidized. I'll have to revisit it to see if they possibly meant asicboost. If you have a link I'm all ears. 
Our fundamental disagreement is around the nature of the centralization. To me it is absolutely obvious. It's electricity costs. I remember posts of guys opening up mining operations *that purchased their own hydroelectric dams*. Let that sink in. China has a ton of hydro in the mountains. Electricity is the entirety of mining opex. Whatever role asicboost plays in centralization is minor in comparison, even negligible.
Big blocks are not going to block bringing mining back to the west. ASICs need to become commodities for that to happen. That or a pow change, or come off of pow all together. In fact, the sheer consumption of electricity created by pow mining is concerning, and needs to change, which is why I hope ethereum can prove the efficacy of pos. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 03:21:49
Each upgrade event is independent. Nobody is talking about 100gb now, nor is a 2mb fork now mean that a blocksize increase is the only way to scale bitcoin moving forward. 
A blocksize increase is the pragmatic thing to do now to clear the mempool and get these fees down. Bitcoin is currently unusable. 
Why do you advocate that we stick to the arbitrary limit imposed 9 years ago, when storage and bandwidth have progressed?
@_date: 2017-11-04 03:11:38
I think you misunderstand consensus. 
Consensus is not dictated. Consensus is *emergent*. Consensus *emerges* on a moment to moment basis.
Attempted forks are supposed to happen in order to give actors a chance to ... well ... act. That is, to choose which chain or version of the protocol to support. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 03:48:23
I don't know. Explain it to me. Point me to sources. What is the 2x camp doing exactly? 
I want 2mb blocks. I am not an idiot nor am I malicious. I believe bitcoin has room to scale on chain. If I was a Miner, I would be signaling 2x, and I would mine it when the time comes, hoping others would follow. (BTW, I used to run a 40 GPU farm right before the first sha256 ASICs hit). It would immediately clear congestion. Blocks are full and fees are high. This is not good. 
What's your response?
Again you're misunderstanding consensus. It's not scheming to attempt an upgrade. It is an opportunity for others to follow. If most follow, the fork they follow is bitcoin. 
This is the definition of Nakamoto consensus. Again, it is emergent. Bitcoin is emergent. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 19:44:05
What are you talking about? Wrong window? It's as if you're having a different conversation than me.
What does the blocksize limit of 1 MB have to do with me controlling my private keys?
What early stage are you talking about? The 1MB limit was arbitrary, and it was set *9 years ago*. 
What book should I be talking from, if not my own?
Yes I do realize about the block speed. It was due to wildly fluctuating hash rate. Yesterday's difficulty algorithm adjustment should help remedy the difficulty fluctuations.
Why don't you address my points about the definition  of an "attack"? I thought that's the conversation you and I are having. Thus far, you're only able to produce non sequiturs. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 20:30:02
Mem pool is full due to money printing spree? How do you figure?
I don't buy the centralization argument. Mining is not centralized in China due to blocksize. It's centralized due to cheap chip manufacturing and cheap hydro power. Both Bitcoins suffer from this. 
I hold equal exactly equal amounts of both BTC and BCH. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 14:50:35
Again with the slippery slope. This is fundamentally flawed logic, and holds no water. 
We can do a blocksize increase now without going to 100mb in the future. Each scaling upgrade is an independent event.
A blocksize increase now will solve the problems we are faced with right now. There is no telling what alternative solutions will materialize in the future when blocks are full again. Whatever they will be, they don't exist *right now*. 
How long are you going to wait for layer 2 solutions to materialize?








Do you see what you're doing? I don't know how else to explain it to you.

@_date: 2017-11-04 02:51:45


It's strange to me that you call the normal functioning of the distributed consensus mechanism a 51% attack. 
If the majority of economic actors elect to follow 2x because they consider it a protocol upgrade worth following, thus forcing the remaining economic actors to join them due to the resulting devaluation of the original 1x chain, then 2x becomes simply Bitcoin. If not, then 2x dies off and 1x remains. 
This is what Bitcoin is designed to do. People are supposed to be pulling the protocol in different direction. This way, Bitcoin evolves through the intelligence (and economic greed) of the masses. If Bitcoin is fragile that it cannot survive a scaling disagreement, then it should not exist at all.

The wallet implements the protocol. The network is the protocol in action. The network doesn't exist without the wallet. **The network is a phenomenon that emerges from the protocol.**
Banks don't use peer to peer distributed systems, and they can have old school backup processes should their systems go down. You could still go to the bank and make deposits (maybe), but would deposits be available for paying via your debit card? It depends on the nature of the system and the failure and the backups if any there are in place. 
With bitcoin,  if a single wallet/node goes down,  no big deal. If they all go down due to a fundamental problem with the protocol or the code implementing the protocol,  the network as it currently stands vanishes, at least until the problem is resolved. In a way,  bitcoin is more resilient than centralized systems.  As long as a single copy of the blockchain exists somewhere, bitcoin lives.

What opposite?
You get bitcoins by either:
* receiving them as a gift
* selling something for them (bitmit.net)
* mining

GPU = graphics processing unit (graphics card)
Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency. There are others, most notably Litecoin. 
What do you want to do with bitcoin? Do you want to just have some? Why don't you just buy a bitcoin, or a fraction of one, and go from there?
Or maybe sell something for some?
Unless you're willing to buy a decent graphics card and fool around with dedicated mining software, mining is probably out of the question for you.

I won't say how much, but my investment is in a GPU mining operation. I'm currently mining altcoins and trading for bitcoins.

Does the pool provide automated exchanging (to BTC, for example)?

For all intents and purposes, it's a currency. Nobody is going to give bitcoins to you for free. You have to do something to earn it. 
You can trade them like any other currency (forex).

I believe the machine scans a QR code for the address that it sends the BTC to. 
@_date: 2013-06-25 06:02:45
There are markets where this happens.

Send cash, get BTC:
@_date: 2013-08-22 02:39:12
Mine with a GPU, but don't mine Bitcoins directly. Mine some alternative cryptocurrency, and trade for Bitcoins.

Would you claim, say, coffee beans if you were trading them with friends back and forth for USD?
It's my understanding that you pay taxes on what you cash out.
