No to your first question.
As for your second question, gox just said that it'll give an update on Monday. Its announcement implied that withdrawals will not be fixed for some time after that. The fact that the gox price is still so low tells you that most gox traders are skeptical that a fix will be implemented anytime soon if ever.

The idea is that when the price goes down, you've incurred a loss whether you sell or not (in the former case, it's a "paper" loss). The amount of that loss constitutes a sunk cost and should be disregarded when assessing your future investment decisions.
The first article is unrelated and relates to business expenses vis-a-vis taxation. The second article is related and I can see why it's confusing. You're saying the cost isn't sunk because you still have the btc which can be sold. My point is the btc is no longer worth as much and you've incurred a sunk cost equivalent to that decrease whether you sell or not. It's like having some equipment for a brick and mortar business (like in the examples in that article) and the equipment depreciates in value. Yes you can sell it and recoup some of your costs, but the loss that remains is "sunk."
Regarding the sunk cost concept as applied to investing specifically, see:

I agree with everything except:


While it's important to know that there have been a few reported instances of Chase closing accounts because of coinbase transactions, this clearly has not happened with most Chase accounts (including my own).
But I agree that a good way to go if you're in the US is coinbase and then transfer to Bitstamp if you want to trade.

The benefits btc may potentially have for poorer individuals without access to good banking solutions has literally nothing to do with the price. From the standpoint of using it as a currency, the price of btc is irrelevant. (Though volatility is bad.)
As for your separate points regarding security, there might be some truth there. Until they can transact with btc securely, its use as a currency is limited. I'm just not sure that being poorer means it's more difficult to transact securely. Also, since they'll generally hold much less btc, they're not as likely to be targeted.

Paragraphs are good
@_date: 2014-03-08 22:44:01
That's true.
Nonetheless, this video combined with these quotes have me reconsidering: 
@_date: 2014-02-17 17:09:25
"If you hold, you don't have to realize a loss." No, no, no. That's not how it works.
A paper loss is just as much a loss as a loss that is "realized.". By your logic you don't realize a loss if you hold, but you would've realized a loss if you sold and immediately rebought -- even though you'd be in exactly the same position (ie, you'd own the same amount of btc). Obviously that makes no sense.
Look into the "sunk cost fallacy." Never let your decision making be affected by how much you initially invested. Only look to the future and whether you think the price will go up or down from where it is now.

Surreal? This is very straight forward and elementary.  "Sunk" literally just means "past," as opposed to future/hypothetical. Got it? There is no such thing as a recoverable expenditure. No one said there was.
This is jargon, a term of art with a unique meaning in the economic realm. It doesn't matter what the term "unrecoverable" means colloquially. Learn to look things up before you debate.
We're done here.

Whether to invest depends on a lot of factors you haven't addressed. Having said that, I don't think $20,000 is all that much considering your income assuming you are confident it won't decrease anytime soon. It's definitely not too late, though you shouldn't expect the kind of appreciation experienced by those who invested a year ago.
I would suggest waiting a couple of months to see how things play out in China. The Chinese have a disproportionate influence on the market right now and the government has signaled a possible crackdown on all bitcoin related transactions. If you Invest now and something happens in the next month -- which is a real possibility -- you could see your investment lose half it's value right away. In a couple of months we'll likely have a better idea of the government's intentions.

This seems very plausible. I'll never understand why anyone would jump to the conclusion that governments or the banks are behind this. That's not impossible, but they have far more effective means of cracking down on bitcoin if they wanted.
It'd be very easy to make a sizable profit shorting btc while conducting the attack and then perhaps buying btc on the cheap immediately before ending it.
@_date: 2014-02-17 19:36:13
Okay. Sorry. I'm honestly not trying to be a dick. I know it sounds weird, but "sunk" just means past as opposed to hypothetical. Yes, all past expenditures are unrecoverable. That was just a bad link. I sent you literally the first one I found and it used the word "unrecoverable" when it shouldn't have since it implies there such a thing as a recoverable expenditure. There is not.
In practice businessmen/economists talk about costs a lot but must be very careful to distinguish between costs that have already been incurred and those that may or may not be incurred depending on future decisions. That's how the term "sunk" developed.
Please read the Wikipedia quote again. It says exactly what I'm saying.
@_date: 2014-02-17 18:14:36
A "sunk" cost is simply a cost that's already been incurred, as opposed to a hypothetical future cost which one can choose to incur or not. The point is that when making an investment of any kind, sunk costs should not factor into any subsequent decision making.
Whether a cost is "sunk" has nothing to do with whether the ultimate gains will be lesser or greater than that initial expenditure. If you bought btc for $100 and sold it for $200 you profited, but the initial $100 still constituted a sunk cost.
 "Sunk costs are unrecoverable past expenditures. These should not normally be taken into account when determining whether to continue a project or abandon it, because they cannot be recovered either way. It is a common instinct to count them, however."
@_date: 2014-02-18 18:02:26
He was just saying that people can get used to transacting in smaller units like what has happened with btc since its price surged.
This is most certainly NOT an increase in the money supply. You admitted as much when you said "There's no increase in the number of monetary units."

This. With all respect to the OP, it seems a lot of people fundamentally misunderstand how mining works. Simply put, if electricity costs more, mining becomes less profitable and the number of miners decreases. This in turn makes difficulty decrease meaning less electricity is needed to mine (ie, the amount of mining decreases until mining requires less electricity such that it becomes marginally profitable again).
@_date: 2014-02-18 00:25:44
What's really going on is that the concept is being used in two very different ways. I'm saying the initial investment ($500) is the sunk cost, and "sunk" here isn't really meaningful. In fact, it can serve to confuse to the extent someone is familiar with the concept as you are (and your use is a better one). I was simply saying the initial investment cost shouldn't inform investment decisions and have seen the sunk cost concept invoked to make this point, but sunk in this context just means past and is basically meaningless. The concept is not as useful when applied to investment assets rather than those that depreciate or are consumed.
I'm sorry again for being a prick before. I thought you were trying get under my skin but looking back I see you weren't.
@_date: 2014-03-09 20:37:33
Traders who wanted to withdraw had to convert to btc because fiat withdrawal requests weren't being honored. This increased demand for btc relative to other exchanges.
Normally arbitrage would bring the btc price back to parity with other exchanges, but this didn't happen because the only way you could profit from the discrepancy would be to withdrawal fiat.
TL; DR: A price difference between exchanges means arbitrage isn't happening, and this in turn means there's a liquidity problem at one of those exchanges. 
@_date: 2014-02-24 23:08:48
Hmmm. Well, despite what I said before, I would seriously consider not using coinbase with your chase account.
While I'm not convinced chase is going to keep closing accounts, it definitely is possible it's starting to disassociate itself from btc altogether. I wouldn't be comfortable wiring funds from chase to bitstamp or any other bitcoin business either.
As chinawat suggested, you might want to open a new account somewhere else. I actually think I'm going to do that myself. Apparently there are some good online bank options. I haven't looked into them yet, but I intend to.
Alternatively, it may be possible to wire funds to bitstamp through western union or to even send them a money order. I don't know off the top of my head.

Just to piggyback on this, people had issues with withdrawals for quite a while and many left for other exchanges for this reason. The price differential between gox and the other exchanges reflected this lack of liquidity and generally can be regarded as a harbinger of future trouble.

That's not what "unrecoverable" means here. It's still unrecoverable even if you get back more than you invested. If you invest $100 and end up with $300, your profit is $200. The initial $100 was not recovered.
A "sunk" cost is just one that's already happened, as opposed to a hypothetical one. The distinction is important for making business decisions. Please look it up before debating. It's a very, very basic business/investment principle and you are definitely misunderstanding how "unrecoverable" is being used in this context.
Edit:  "In economics and business decision-making, a sunk cost is a retrospective cost that has already been incurred and cannot be recovered. Sunk costs are sometimes contrasted with prospective costs, which are future costs that may be incurred or changed if an action is taken."

Wealthier individuals will benefit more from an increase in the btc price because they could afford to buy more btc, that's true. So yes, in absolute terms, relatively rich people get even richer from investing in btc than poorer people (as with any Iinvestment).

This. Despite what some here seem to think, you could most definitely bring a civil suit for breach of contact (ie, of the terms of service) and/or conversion (theft). Coinbase is located in the US -- which obviously has a (overly) developed legal system -- and their customers are based in the US. Depending on the circumstances, the plaintiffs could prevail. Valuing the btc would be an issue, but, given that there are exchanges where the price is quoted, it's actually quite easy compared to other things courts routinely have to determine the monetary value of.

@_date: 2014-02-22 02:03:04
Yes, even if gox allows withdrawals, nobody's going to keep selling at the current gox price when withdrawals are enabled.
And while some traders who got the cheap btc before withdrawals are enabled might then sell, that's not technically an arbitrage. And there's no reason to think a large portion of them will sell anyway.
Also, to the extent any do sell, it'll most likely be offset by the buying that will result from the renewed market confidence.
@_date: 2014-02-17 16:39:27
"I haven't lost any value because I have not sold at this price": This is complety wrong. Look into the "sunk cost fallacy." All that's matters is your assessment of future price action. The amount you spent in the past (the "sunk" cost) is irrelevant.
Think of it this way: If you somehow knew for sure that the price was going to drop by $100 five minutes from now, clearly the right thing to do is to sell immediately and then buy back after the drop. By your logic, you wouldn't sell now unless you'd make a profit in light of your initial outlay. Obviously that's wrongheaded.
Simply disregard the initial cost and instead base your decisions on whether you believe the price will rise or fall from where it is now.

Coinbase (if in the US) to buy and hold. To trade, use BITSTAMP. Surprised nobody's said it given that the consensus is that bitstamp is the best exchange (though if you want to trade on margin or short, try bitfinex). Btc-e is generally regarded as the second best exchange, but is considered less reliable.
Buy at coinbase (if you can) and if you're going to trade at all, transfer to bitstamp (or btc-e).
Can also consider Kraken and Bitfinex, but going with a solid, high volume exchange like bitstamp is your best bet.

Thanks. That's what I assumed, but just wanted some confirmation. It seems possible that people might be attracted to trading assets that are exchanged via the bitcoin protocol but prefer to transact with USD rather than BTC. Do you think this is unlikely or will be impossible (ie, you'll only be able to use BTC to buy these assets)?

Because if all the losers move to bitcoin, the winners in the current system will see their wealth decline significantly -- they'll see it transferred to the adopters of this new more efficient, streamlined system.
In reality, the winners in the current system are smart enough to realize this before too long and rather than trying to beat bitcoin, will join it.

Fair enough. I agree with a lot of what you've said in as far as you're proposing a trading philosophy designed to prevent panic selling and other irrational trading behavior. Having said that, I simply cannot agree that in an objective sense "when it comes to Bitcoin, the original decision to purchase should carry more weight than future evaluations." If you just mean that this will tend to help traders behave more rationally, regardless of the objective truth of that statement, then it makes some sense.
I'm simply suggesting people should try to honestly assess where they see the price going from where it is currently, and not let this determination become influenced by how much they originally spent. It is well established that taking the "sunk" cost into account is incorrect.
@_date: 2014-02-17 17:17:56
If you think the price will increase over the long term from here (which I would agree with, btw), then of course you should continue holding. I'm not against a buy and hold approach. 
Having said that, a paper loss is just as much a loss as a loss that is "realized." I'm just trying to help people be honest with their accounting. By your logic you don't realize a loss if you hold, but you would realize a loss if you sold and immediately rebought -- even though you'd be in exactly the same position (ie, you'd own the same amount of btc). That doesn't make sense.
@_date: 2014-03-05 01:55:35

Only traders are dependent on exchanges. Mass adoption means adoption by those who use it primarily as a currency or to hold as an investment for the long term, not to trade on a frequent basis. They shouldn't leave their bitcoin on exchanges or with other third parties. Now whether they'll be smart enough not to, that is a real issue.

Yes. The actual quote could be interpreted multiple ways, but the author is clearly saying that the guy means his friends are bearish and have pulled out of stocks and other securities.

The point is you could have literally bought any real estate asset or group of assets and, on average, done better than he did in terms of a return on investment. Getting in the trenches is a nice sentimental way of putting it, but you're effectively trying to give him credit for misallocating resources--in an incredibly gaudy, self aggrandizing manner at that.
He could have simply bought assets outright without plastering his name everywhere and erecting gaudy hotels and added more value to society. He should have left the "getting in the trenches" part to the people who actually knew what they were doing.

You do realize that he has likely underperformed the real estate sector, right? I.e., his net worth is less than it would be if he had just invested his inheritance in a diversified real estate portfolio. He focused on an incredibly profitable sector--not because he had any insight, mind you, but just because that's what his father did--and apparently significantly underperformed it.
I don't have some bias against him because of his political leanings, btw. It's just that he's clearly unintelligent, self-absorbed and obsessed with making outlandish statements and doing outlandish things to get attention... What's funny is how many people take him seriously because they think, Well, he must know something because he's been so successful. This farce about him being good at making deals or otherwise being an accomplished businessman is complete BS. He inherited millions, was able to obtain astronomic amounts of credit because of his father, and happened to be in the right sector at the right time out of sheer luck--that's the only reason why you've even heard of him.
Here's a nice quote, for example:
"Bloomberg News has estimated Trump's net worth at only $2.9 billion, while Forbes put it at $4.1 billion. Since Trump’s businesses aren’t public, the true figure isn’t clear... Business Week estimated Trump’s net worth at $100 million in 1978. If Trump had merely put that money in an index fund based on the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index — the kind many Americans use to save for retirement — he would be worth $6 billion today."

Coinbase is not nearly as bad as some here will tell you. There's a very vocal minority who go on about how much they suck, but the vast majority are happy with them. Their fees are a little high, but arguably it's worth it given how stable/trustworthy they are...
My comment's probably going to be downvoted to hell, but whatever... I'm not affiliated with them or anything and, if you're more interested in an exchange, I can also recommend Bitstamp, Bitfinex and others. But regarding Coinbase, just do a search for them and look around and you'll see that most people are actually very happy with them (unless they're day traders who understandably don't want to pay the fees or wait for the transactions to settle). I think their great for beginners who just want to hold

His reason for believing this is pure conjecture and IMHO illogical.
He's basically implying that the halving is going to take miners by surprise or something, when of course they're more aware of it than anyone
@_date: 2016-06-17 02:47:46
Yeah, it's being reported somewhat... and not just blog posts. WSJ, Reuters and Bloomberg all had actual articles.
There hasn't been all that much coverage yet, but that's not surprising given that we're not near an ATH

I hate to break it to you guys, but there's rampant manipulation on the bitcoin exchanges, assuming your definition includes "whales" who engage in wash trades to manipulate volume metrics and pump and dump to induce smaller traders to enter/exit positions, etc. There are a small number of players with huge holdings who take advantage of their size given the lack of liquidity, and it's clear that's what sometimes happens if you watch the intraday candles.
It's a largely unregulated market. So it's to be expected. And I suppose there are forms of systemic manipulation on the large securities exchanges (e.g., HFT, market maker manipulation, etc.) that don't yet take place on the bitcoin exchanges.

You were saying that as the price increases, BTC somehow becomes viewed as too expensive. I don't agree. "Too expensive" has no meaning when it comes to currency, only expectations regarding it's change in value over time--i.e., anticipated fluctuations in terms of how much it can buy, whether in terms of consumer goods, other currencies, or anything else.
Whether 1 bitcoin is currently exchanged for $1, $1,000 or $100,000 is simply irrelevant. People will want it if they think it's value is stable or is likely to increase relative to other currencies (in addition to if it is a convenient medium of exchange and transferring value to others).

Agreed. These points sum up my thoughts perfectly:






@_date: 2016-06-14 03:22:50
Well he also adjusts based on estimated number of coins lost...
To be clear, I don't even agree with his analysis. I was just trying to explain it.
@_date: 2016-06-18 01:13:11
That does make sense and I didn't think of that. Thanks for the explanation.
I was thinking it would cause capital that was in ETH to move to BTC, which is why I said that... But I now get how the two were connected--traders using to BTC to trade ETH
@_date: 2016-06-21 21:03:44
This. And I would add that of the exchanges that offer margin trading, it has the best reputation.
@_date: 2016-06-13 22:17:22
Yes, and he's saying that the price BTC trades at is misleading in that it can't be properly compared to a price from a while ago unless you adjust the prior price for the increased supply of coins (which would make it lower). E.g., looking at the above comment's stock example, he would say it makes sense to divide the stock's pre-split price by 2 when comparing it to the current market price.
This was also posted on June 4, 2016: 
FWIW, I disagree with his analysis since it only makes sense in the case of equities, not when it comes to currencies or Bitcoin. I explain why in my comment the last time this was posted so I won't elaborate here
Edit: In case it's not clear, OP reposted this today because according to Lingham's analysis, the previous price ATH is actually only $700 when adjusted for new coins, so today we've attained a new ATH (and, equivalently, a new market cap ATH)
@_date: 2016-06-26 02:16:19


That's not exactly right. The premium is caused by GBTC demand vs. supply. It's value is tied to BTC, but it's effectively a different security altogether. Obviously if the demand for GBTC declines vs. the supply, investors will be worse off. But this is unrelated to the premium vs. BTC
Put another way, it's conceivable that the premium will increase over time, in which case many GBTC investors will make even more than the average BTC investor... Though I concede this isn't likely in the long run since another fund will surely be created/approved
@_date: 2016-06-13 04:04:08
Yep, those are the wash trades I mentioned and you're absolutely right that those should not be included in volume... And after thinking it over some more, I think I was overlooking what you and everyone else are really saying--not that no fee transactions are necessarily fake, but that having no fees leads to more wash trades since there's no transaction cost to deter them. Makes sense
Edit: Changed "wash sales" to "wash trades" because I just learned that they're two different things
@_date: 2016-06-05 03:25:09
Actually, I don't think so. Sure, it'd be quite low, but not zero. (This would be the case even if it were mined and never spent since it will almost definitely be spent at some point in the future,though the velocity calculation here would require an estimate.) And this makes all the difference since the total purchasing power (or "market cap," as it's being referred to here) of a currency is simply the number of currency units circulating* times the exchange rate for the chosen base currency (e.g., USD).
I do agree that lost coins should be treated as being out of circulation however, and these can be thought of as having a velocity of zero now regardless of how many times they were spent/exchanged prior to being lost.

Well, I mostly agree with you. I wouldn't go quite as far--I don't think the article is horrible or anything, and I appreciate the author's effort--but I am surprised it's getting so much attention... Can't help but think it is just because he's bullish and this place is more of a "circle jerk" than I like to admit.
It's also a matter of expectations. If I thought it was just another random article, I probably would have been pleasantly surprised given how low my expectations are for pieces on bitcoin. But yeah, it's not particular insightful for anyone who reads a lot about bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-06-12 07:03:59
There have been many news articles in just the last month, including some in the Chinese media itself:
  
  
South China Morning Post:   
  
  
  
  
There are more if you do a Google news search for "bitcoin" and "China" for the last month. Most of them bring up the devaluation of the Yuan as the impetus, as well the Chinese government's apparent indifference to bitcoin currently despite having cracked down on it in the past.
There's the volume reported on various sites:  
  
  
  
There's also the time-of-day point I made. And there's the fact that BTC will temporarily trade at a premium on the Chinese exchanges until arbitragers are able to do their thing, which seems to indicate that Chinese traders are the ones pulling the price up.
Edit: Added the bitcoinity volume link
@_date: 2016-06-14 01:17:03
I didn't even notice that, but that is funny. It's like they're trying to make bitcoin sound really esoteric/bizzare
@_date: 2016-06-05 03:09:02
GDP is periodic, not cumulative, so it's not a good comparison. I.e., the value of a currency is not tantamount to sales/revenues on an income statement, but rather the total value of assets on a balance sheet.
"Market cap" is kind of a misnomer, but nonetheless the most meaningful analogue is total BTC in circulation times the exchange rate, in USD or whatever. And it does make sense to subtract a reasonable estimate of the number of lost coins, despite how inherently inexact this is.
Velocity is important in determining BTC's true value in an overarching sense, and in projecting its future relevancy, but it doesn't affect this basic market cap calculation.
@_date: 2016-06-13 02:32:42
Maybe it wasn't on purpose, but you have completely changed your point. Obviously BTC isn't worth $100,000 at the moment. That goes without saying. But if the fundamentals showed that it was (that is, if it was "deserved" as you put it, based on the scale of adoption, etc), then the mere fact that $100,000 might superficially seem like a lot to pay for 1 unit of currency is irrelevant. That's all I and others are saying. And whether you realize it or not, that's what you were initially arguing against
@_date: 2016-06-16 15:54:04


What are you talking about? Seriously.
He's saying miners often enter into actual shorting positions (i.e., place short orders on exchanges) so they can get cash today for coins they mine in the future which they will use to cover their short positions. Do you have any evidence that this is actually true?
He's also saying that they likely shorted more than they can actually cover later due to the halving, which seems very improbable to me. Obviously they know the halving is coming up
@_date: 2016-06-07 03:12:31
I would completely agree if I had more faith that China's interest will be sustained.
But yes, all things being equal, I think it's a great sign that the price appreciates without inordinate media attention. I'd like to think that there's institutional interest behind it, but my understanding is that the current rally is mainly due to the Chinese and akin to the build up in late 2013 before their government cracked down somewhat.
@_date: 2016-06-16 16:45:46
Yes, this is what a lot of us are thinking. Overall it's a **very** positive sign that there's been this run up w/out much media coverage.
Having said that, if the price doesn't increase enough to get the coverage, then the rally might be more limited. But IF we hit an ATH and then there's a ton of media coverage...
@_date: 2016-06-12 21:54:17
I get what you're saying and don't completely disagree. But it's also true that since I wrote that comment my gain has increased to 29%, far higher than the S&amp;P.
But yeah, the price might plunge again tomorrow. The short run is very uncertain, but I do believe the potential return far exceeds the risk in the long run. And it's historic.
@_date: 2016-06-12 23:04:21
I'm always intrigued by this line of thinking. If the volume is due to wash sales or otherwise fabricated, then yes, it's artificial and meaningless. But the fact that there are no fees doesn't somehow mean that the sales or the price underlying those transactions are somehow less significant. Unless you're talking about wash trades/made up numbers, this volume is just as "real" as the volume on exchanges with fees.
Volume is important because it indicates how much liquidity there was at the time of the increase and therefore whether the price is more or less susceptible to a sudden decrease. If, in reality, there was much less liquidity, then it would take less selling pressure to bring the price back down. But nonexistent fees doesn't translate to less "real" liquidity.
Someone please enlighten me if I'm missing something... I keep seeing this comment over and over.
@_date: 2016-06-05 02:18:55
I have some issues with this analysis...
When a company issues a stock split, the stock price is cut in half because the firm does not receive any capital for the new shares. It's an accounting gimmick with no substance.
I'm not sure it makes sense to compare this to the additional issuance of BTC. You're not giving an entity dollars and increasing the value of its assets. BTC derives its value from its purchasing power, so like other currencies it actually does make sense to look at the number of BTC in circulation times its exchange rate, whether in USD, another currency or a basket of currencies... Though I do agree that "market cap" is a bit of a misnomer; there's a reason no one uses the term in reference to other currencies/commodities.
But while some say market cap is misleading because as people sell BTC the price drops and so its not as though it would take the market cap to buy all outstanding BTC, I actually disagree with this objection since this is true of all currencies--or practically any other asset class--including most public companies themselves.
There are approximately $1.45 trillion in circulation. The "market cap" of USD is best understood as 1.45 trillion times the exchange rate for whatever other currency(ies) is being used as the base. Like BTC, if everyone decided to sell all their USD, it's value would plummet too. Nonetheless, this market cap figure is still the best way of describing the value of all USD in circulation.
As an aside, miners are paying for the BTC they generate. The fact that they're not buying it on an exchange doesn't negate this because--again--even when you do buy on an exchange, it's not going to an organization and thereby increasing its assets. So looking at how much miners spend to create new BTC is a valid component of the market cap.
Also, the short squeeze theory bothers me because I suspect they're aware of the halving and consequently wouldn't be dumb enough to enter into shorts for BTC they're not going to mine... Anyway, enjoyed the referenced blog posts. Good food for thought

Value of the dollar stays flat/decreases. Some people buy BTC because they think it's a better store of value vs. the dollar, and this news plays into that narrative
@_date: 2016-06-12 23:38:46
Respectfully, I really don't understand your logic. As it is already, the vast majority of bitcoin transactions are for something other an even number of bitcoins. Bitcoin has incredible fungibility/divisibility, much more so than other currencies. In fact, that's why it's not necessary that transactions are for a whole multiple.
It's really a matter of semantics. If a price increase warrants, we may start using another name for a given fraction of a bitcoin in the way that we already speak of Satoshis.
@_date: 2016-06-07 02:47:14
Like all things in life, there isn't just one factor at play. Believe it or not, someone might want to obtain a currency BOTH because it they hope its value will appreciate and because it can be used as a medium of exchange. That's what monetary policy is all about--interest rates are lowered to stimulate spending, an idea which is premised on the notion that currencies are BOTH a store of value and used to buy goods.
As a practical matter, yes, bitcoin is currently being hoarded by a lot by early adopters--something which should be expected with an asset with its characteristics--but over time this tendency will decrease as the price levels out (or at least is less volatile) and spending it becomes less unappealing (and/or hoarders who no longer use any other form of currency are compelled to use it to pay bills).
...Or bitcoin could fail altogether, perhaps because it's eclipsed by another digital currency. To be clear, I'm not a bitcoin fanatic, I just honestly don't agree with your overly simplistic argument that a currency must either be hoarded or a medium of exchange, when in reality it is necessarily both a store of value (and thus subject to a certain amount of hoarding) and used to make purchases. It's just that one or the other motive for having it will be more prominent than the other at a given point in time.

@_date: 2016-06-10 22:35:22
Well, I think maybe there's a slight misunderstanding of what I meant in addition to a difference of opinion.
Fundamental analysis is used in currency trading and all other speculative markets. It's simply encompasses everything except technical analysis. For instance, when major currencies are devalued, it makes BTC more valuable (all things being equal), and this is an example of an event that someone employing fundamental analysis takes into account regardless of price action.
I simply disagree that "there is no explanation of how to turn fundamentals into a price" and "fundamentals are not useful on short or medium term trading." If you mean that it's an inexact science--admittedly, a very inexact one with respect to BTC--well that frankly goes without saying, and applies to all markets, including equities. But understanding what underlies a surge of demand is important to investing in bitcoin regardless of your time horizon, though obviously less so if you're day trading.
@_date: 2016-06-13 03:56:20
I didn't say "the unit of currency is irrelevant." I said what you pay for "1 unit of currency is irrelevant" in the sense that we could have moved the decimal point over such that what we happen to call one bitcoin today would instead be 1/10th of a bitcoin. It wouldn't actually change anything whatsoever. The price of one bitcoin in the latter case would be 1/10th as much, but 10 times the number of bitcoins would be outstanding. It's equivalent to a stock split. It's meaningless aside from semantics. You started off by saying that this would affect people's willingness to purchase bitcoin, which is wrong

Log is superior in principle, but since tech analysis is concerned with anticipating other traders' moves, you want to use what most of them are using.
The general idea is to try various scales, indicators, etc. until you find what corresponds to past price action, and then use those going forward regardless of whether other traders "should have" been using them. It's all a self-fulfilling prophecy

Why do people no longer mention China's role in the Nov/Dec 2013 spike? I was intensely focused on bitcoin's price action at the time and for months afterward, and I remember that the overwhelming consensus then was that Chinese demand was the main impetus, with Mt Gox's shenanigans being an important but secondary cause. I realize that people are skeptical of the reported volume at Chinese exchanges, but they were then too, and it was still thought that China was mainly behind the rally. Has the consensus changed since then?

Hate to admit it, but my average cost stems from purchases in late 2013 and is around $520... I just looked at the S&amp;P 500 index and my 19% gain happens to be exactly the same as that benchmark during that time frame. Kind of cool that I'm finally gonna surpass it.
Like you said, there are a lot of people who've been holding for years who are coming up on that break-even point... I'm not very worried about them selling though--it's been long enough that they've probably adopted a long-term perspective regardless of their mindset when they bought in. At least that's how it is for me
@_date: 2016-06-10 17:34:15
I agree with most of this, and you clearly have a good understanding of the technical analysis aspect, which I do value, but I believe right now is the time to focus on "fundamentals," by which I specifically mean China and the halving. I think currently these should drive peoples' decisions much more than the chart, as well as their time horizon (i.e., if they are looking to hold short or long term).
I'm NOT saying China's renewed interest and the halving necessarily mean the price will rise, but I'm very interested in the Chinese because I believe there's a chance their accumulation will be sustained this time. If their government doesn't signal an intent to intervene, the price really could rise quite dramatically over a period of months/years... But of course, last time this happened the government did crack down a bit and their interest quickly collapsed, along with the price.
And then there's the halving, though I think it's largely priced in already and its future impact is being overstated by some.
@_date: 2016-06-23 15:02:00


You want to buy if you expect the price to rise before you sell. **What happened in the past is of no significance.**
What OP suggests might make sense, but it might not. Forget the first purchase. If you CURRENTLY still believe the price will go up before you sell, then buy more. But if you have since concluded that the price will not go up (maybe the drop makes you think the upward trend has reversed), then don't.
@_date: 2016-06-17 15:45:25

Sure, it's not true that *everything* has been priced in already, as you put it, since people don't know certain things about what the future will bring. But that's irrelevant, because they do know about the halving
Your digression about the EMH is beside the point, because speculators most certainly are aware of the halving and it's pretty clear that the price has already been bid up in anticipation of it. In fact, it's quite possible that the price has risen too high based on its anticipated effects, and that the net increase from the actual reduction of supply will be nil... And I say this as someone who is quite bullish long term
@_date: 2016-07-13 05:53:59
Actually you can already buy BTC using an IRA via GBTC... But the ETF would be much better in that it would more accurately track BTC's price
@_date: 2016-07-04 05:02:48
Who's talking about the average person? We're talking about those who hold enough BTC to actually affect the price, and the vast majority of them are very aware of the halving... I'm not pessimistic about a further price increase or anything, but it's a little naive not to realize that those with substantial holdings have been trading with the halving in mind for months

There are so many inaccuracies here it's not even funny. I truly don't mean to offend, but I hope you're not investing too much based off this analysis--and I say this as a holder myself who's very much a long term bull
For one thing, they did not have the same information last time as we do today. We know about the 2013 bubble, they did not. There is not less BTC available now than before--I suppose you just mean that production will be less, but you're strongly suggesting that the overall supply has decreased, which of course is wrong. The fact that the market's illiquid and investors aren't savvy is just as likely to lead to overexuberance as underestimating the halving's effects. Finally, bear in mind that the required influx of new capital to increase the price by X dollars must be magnitudes higher as we go up. I could go on, but I won't

This doesn't address his concern at all. He's correct that the price likely already reflects traders' expectations of the effect of the halving on supply vs. demand
Maybe he was confusing the halving with a reverse stock split, but you have absolutely no reason to think so based on what he said
@_date: 2016-07-04 05:07:05


Exactly. This is incredibly strong evidence that it has in fact been priced in already... And it's possible it's risen too much relative to the actual halving effects, in which case there'd be no net positive future impact
