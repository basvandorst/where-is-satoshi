I am not personally attached to the idea that everyone on earth uses bitcoin in the future, so I don't care if retailers jump on or not.  And I agree about the user base.  My point was that they don't have to accept LN to gain LNs benefit in the same way they don't have to directly accept bitcoin to gain bitcoins benefit.

There are 4 tradeoffs listed in the explanation that address:
* max tx size
* privacy
* speed
* fees
None of these are specific to your concern.  Your concern is directly addressed in the last section labled "3) Network Payment":
"Your wallet finds a route from you to Charles that has a) sufficient liquidity, and b) least fees"
@_date: 2016-04-13 22:16:23
Starbucks won't ever directly accept bitcoin (or maybe they will, but they don't need to).  They will integrate a payment system that has bitcoin as an option (ala Braintree or NCR), or one of the payment systems they already use will integrate bitcoin.  The payment systems will be the ones working with Lightning Network payment channels.  Abstraction layers are what makes all the complicated bits that your worried about a non-issue.
@_date: 2016-04-14 05:13:25
I'm not exactly sure how route discovery works, but you have got me curious so I will do some more reading.  I assume that:
a) A hub/wallet can create a channel with any other hub/wallet on the fly (a 'hop' in TCP/IP lingo)
b) A hub/wallet can interrogate the LN hubs to determine their available liquidity and their established or preferred channels
I totally see your point about the hubs getting busted for facilitating illegal shit.  More research for me :)
Edit: It's probably helpful to think about how the major internet nodes today pass traffic and don't get busted.
@_date: 2016-04-14 04:20:06
LN payment channel routing is a lot like TCP/IP dynamic routing.  It will find the a path through the network that has:
1) Sufficient liquidity
2) Least Fees
3) Least Hops
So if a hub gets taken out, there will be other routes to choose. 
@_date: 2016-04-14 14:26:30
Though not very valuable (to me anyway) even your opinion is welcome here.
@_date: 2016-04-14 04:25:50
They don't have to directly accept it, eg run a full node, or sign up for bitpay and integrate their terminals/website.  They either run a payment processor that supports it (and gain the benefits) or they don't.
We agree on the second point :)

Possibly!  To me the heart of the block size debate was driven by the immediacy of doom and gloom scenarios touted by "big blockists".  I believe that most "small blockists" are interested in bigger blocks if/when it makes sense but are much more calm about it as well as being interested in supporting technologies like LN/SegWit/sidechains that also increase capacity.  There was a time where these emerging techs were really exciting to the community, then all of a sudden the sky was falling. I have no evidence to support it, but it really seemed like a vocal minority making a concerted effort to spread fear in the community.  Diving into the actual progress being made is exciting and makes me even more calm in the face all this theoretical doom and gloom.

* If you intend to send micro-payments and your partner intends to collect micro-payments, you will both use wallets the support LN and this will all be handled nearly transparently to both of you.
* If you find yourself needing to send LN micro payments to someone who needs to open a channel, you probably shouldn't be using LN  (Use a regular tx)
* The "speed tradeoff" is about collecting funds to spend on the regular network after receiving LN funds, its not about opening up LN payment channels.
* ~~Opening a channel is instantaneous (create the required txs, sign your half , transmit to your partner, your partner does the same, verify the sig and your ready to go)~~
Edit: I was wrong, you will need to send btc to a multisig address and wait for confirmation before opening up a channel.  I still think that anyone consuming micro-payments will already be setup by the time you want to send to them.

I agree with the your first point although your thinking is redundant.  Using anything is a choice.  Just because I personally like bitcoin doesn't make it inherently good for the world.
As far as people using LN because they can't send money over bitcoin, that's a non-issue.  If people can't send over bitcoin, they won't be able to send over LN.
@_date: 2016-04-14 03:56:21
I'm not following you at all.  Fees will be at credit card parity?  Very unlikely, but let's pretend it happened:  Fees will make bitcoin uselessly expensive?  Bitcoin will still be useful...the doom of 1MB blocks crippling the network to uselessness is just not a thing.  LN provides capacity to the network allowing the core network to remain decentralized.  My guess is that you do not value the decentralization fundamentals of bitcoin.  If this is the case, why do you care about its success?

LN is not released yet, let alone available for someone to make a voluntary choice to use.  You are speculating that no-one will want to use it.  Many people still think no-one wants to use bitcoin.

@_date: 2016-04-22 22:18:51
I guess I don't much about the details, even in my own country, but I assume each country has their own laws governing what is considered legal proof of ownership over various assets.  Proving you hold a private key to a colored coin on the blockchain would need to be acknowledged by that government if you want protection by their legal system.

As a BTC trader who spends way too much time staring at 1 minute charts I am fullly convinced that there is tons of "fake" volume on OKCoin.  There are times when the order books basically stay the same but you will see extremely large buys and sells within the spread which is most likely is a bot selling/buying from itself.  This usually goes on for about 30 minutes then suddenly will stop. There are no fees to trade CNY here so the only cost to do this would be if another bot acted against it.

I disagree that the LTB discussion clearly shows that Gavin has thought this through. The concerns that Peter discusses are talked around and not fully addressed, specifically that it will take longer for big blocks to download giving miners incentive to centralize. It's a fairly circular argument with both sides saying the other will lead to centralization.

@_date: 2015-06-02 05:54:49
One point he brought up in the LTB episode: As a miner, bigger blocks means longer network transfer times.  Profit margin is lost waiting for blocks to be received (more time wasted on worthless hashing) as well as propagating them to the network (valid work orphaned more often).  Access to better networks provides better profits and incentivizes mining centralization.

Both sides have arguments based on unproven theories. What makes the big block theory more valid? In my opinion it's the view of a product manager as opposed to that of a technical lead. There is risk in bitcoin going to zero on both sides.... I choose to be weary about this happening because of security reasons over usability reasons.

Unfortunately its one of those problems that can't be solved outright, people are weak, trolling works so well and its so easy to do so of course its going to be leveraged and even monetized.  Part of the solution is acceptance, enjoying a laugh and not taking things too seriously.  Part of the solution is adapting and learning to recognize troll behavior.  Part of the solution is to disincentive troll behavior, and the more we can decentralize this kind of governance, the better.

Yes there is: when you go to spend it.  Using lots of inputs in a transaction makes it larger (in bytes).  Miners prioritize transactions to include in a block based on size, output, priority and included fees. Most miners expect that 0.0001 BTC per 1KB in transaction size is included as a fee.  Without a proper fee your large transaction will probably never get on the block chain (and thus, never be confirmed).   Luckily for little guy, there is a mining pool called Eligius which will accept transactions for a very little or no fee at all.  So what you would want to do is create a new address to consolidate all of your small inputs.  Create one (or a few) massive transactions using the small inputs to send to your consolidation address, include the recommended fee that Eligius requests, add the Eligius node to your bitcoin client, then wait for your transaction to be confirmed (It may take a while, not only do you need to wait until Eligius solves a block that gets accepted by the network, there may be a line of other people waiting to have their low fee transaction confirmed).  Once your consolidation TX is confirmed you can spend that coin as normal.

The Bitcoin alert system is actual, literal 100% centralization.  What is it used for?  "Please upgrade to version x.xx because the core devs have updated it."  The updates by the way are another form of centralization that is unavoidable without releasing code which never needs updating (good luck).  Bitcoin mining centralization is admittedly theoretical/perceived, so far there have been several pools to reach 51% and nothing bad has happened....yet....but wait until Gavin has to release his "Not To Be Used Except In Case of Emergency" branch.  (
Peercoin has had plan's since the beginning to remove checkpointing, you either understand the game plan or keep clinging to your holy decentralized grail, and never-mind the devs behind the curtain.
If you are really interested in true decentralization, you should check out the bitshares projects...Daniel Larimer's DAC ideas are all about writing P2P code and releasing it into the wild....cutting all cords to human intervention, to live or die as seen fit, rather than attempting to uphold an already shaky system with regular updates.
But again, I am absolutely in love with Bitcoin and I look forward to seeing it succeed with a little help from the it's evil twin centralization.

Colored coins are bitcoins that represent something in addition to bitcoin.  Someone correct me if I am wrong, but it is a standard more than a specific technology i.e. a method for writing decentralized property ownership consensus software on top of bitcoin.  Reddit could issue 100,000,000 Reddit Notes by "coloring" 1 BTC and declaring that each satoshi of this bitcoin is 1 Reddit Note.  These reddit notes/special satoshis could then be transferred using regular bitcoin transactions. 
Sidechains could actually be considered a type of colored coin where a bitcoin represents tokens on another blockchain (called the sidechain).  The difference is that when they are "pegged" to a sidechain, their existence in the mainchain is suspended.  Reddit would build a new crypto-currency and allow bitcoin to be pegged to it to create new reddit notes.  Reddit notes would be transferred and exchanged on this sidechain and those could then be transferred back into bitcoins on the bitcoin mainchain.

It proves that something existed before a certain point in time because you can not precompute the hash of the picture.  The hash gets stored at a provable point in time on the blockchain. If you take a picture of something that only existed after a point in time...you can also prove that the picture did not exist before that.
Edit: the second part can be faked by shopping in a current event to an old photo. So you really can only prove that the last modification did not happen before a certain point in time.

I'm confused....it isn't an attack vector?  Didn't you say "historical attack" just before this?

In both Peercoin and Bitcoin, waiting for 6 or more confirmations is equally relevant.

How many times have you heard or read "bitcoin is experimental"?
I am a believer in the resilience of the technology.  Every step of the way we are pushing the boundaries of how far this network can go.  It's a delicate balance and the developers would probably say we are pushing too hard at times.  Each problem gives the ecosystem a chance to build immunity.  So far none of these challenges are deadly, but we have to keep in mind that we are beta testers and we should treat our investments in the technology as such.  
Also, Bitcoin exchanges are *centralized* and unregulated.  It is not correct to compare the challenges/dangers of using bitcoin with those of using exchanges.

As long as the issuer releases the specs of their colored coin implementation then you can determine and track this yourself.  Using my example, everyone could see that there was a "genesis coin" of 1BTC and track the movement of these 100,000,000 satoshis on the bitcoin blockchain.  The real trust lies in the issuer honoring token redemption.  If the additional value of one of these Reddit Notes is that you can redeem it for a Reddit gold (for example), then you will have to trust that when you transfer one of your colored satoshis back to reddit that they will give you gold.


Well, I am pretty sure that normally the idea is that colored coins are not mined.  But that shouldn't stop you from building an alternative blockchain (or merge mining with bitcoin at a different difficulty) where producing a valid block grants you the right to color some bitcoin...

Checkout NuBits.  It is a decentralized "central" bank which keeps it's value pegged to USD so that 1 NBT always = 1 USD.
If demand for NBT is high, shareholders vote to release new NBT.  If demand for NBT is low, shareholders interest rates for "parking" NBT go up, giving people incentive to buy and hold NBT.  The shareholders are owners of NuShares, which is a decentralized autonomous organization (i.e. a blockchain) with these voting rules coded in.

Peter, I believe you are wrong about Proof of Stake, at least when it comes to Peercoin.  PPC is more resistant than Bitcoin to a 51% attack by the simple fact that it costs more to obtain an equivalent share of network control. In addition, minting PoS in pools gains no advantage over minting alone which makes pool centralization a non-issue. All criticisms about the security of Peercoin, especially the "Nothing at Stake" concept, have been well rebutted and are no more real than the theoretical attacks regularly discussed around bitcoin.

If this turns out to be untrue, there will be no time to argue the opposite: that bitcoin mining requires far too many natural resources to secure the blockchain.  Either way its a very risky proposition.
I believe that Satoshi underestimated the net waste of running an arms race to secure the blockchain UNLESS he was considering: 
-how mining rigs might be integrated with appliances and find additional utility to the energy they consume
-updates to or forks/alts of the code could offer solutions.  Personally, I think the Proof-of-Stake Peercoin holds the right answer.
I think Bitcoin is amazing and it's technology is revolutionary, but I believe changes will need to be made to address the energy consumption issue.

A majority of the problems that critics bring up about bitcoin are not problems with bitcoin, they are problems with existing financial systems.  Often what is sited is something that bitcoin actually helps in some degree to solve.  During the process of moving to bitcoin as a financial instrument, old, centralized models (exchanges, escrow services, AML conformance, arbitrators, etc...) are being leveraged to make the transition easier mainly because these services are more familiar to the masses.  It will be a while until a critical mass can easily accept/understand the idea that trust can be implicit using cryptography.

You mentioned being on the Oracle America's Cup for the win. I was in SF for a giants game on Sept. 8th and remember seeing the Cup being staged by the ferry building. That was the day I watched mt.

Even though if I was actually speaking at this hearing I would be stuttering and my entire body would break out in sweat...the whole time I watched this I was wishing I was on of the speakers.  Key missed points (I only watched the 2nd half):
Programmable money: M of N transactions, delayed transactions, reversible transactions, contracts for difference
Digital Autonomous Corporation: What Bitcoin really is.  Protocol exists by consensus and can be changed by consensus.  Buy and selling cryptos is more analogous to buying shares in a corporation.
Alternate proof algorithms, most importantly proof of stake.  Green benefits over PoW.

Those were unconfirmed transactions that betcoin dice was accepting. Companies (questionable ones at that) loosing money accepting zero confirmation transfers will not damage bitcoin's integrity.
A properly executed 51% attack by a group or cartel is a serious threat but one that avoids itself from miners and pools by being a bad financial decision.  While I personally believe ghash will never be the underpinning of bitcoin, all-caps Reddit posts are a natural reaction to pools approaching 51%.

Well I did some research after reading this and found that the CLOAK developer "believes" they has found a vulnerability in the PoS code.  CLOAK is based on PPC.  I reviewed some of the CLOAK modifications and it looks like other than the basic tuning done on most alts (block time mods, difficulty mods, reward mods) they made some changes to the way time stamps determine a valid block.  I plan to spend more time looking into this, but for now, I believe it's safe to say that the "vulnerability" is nothing new to the PPC devs.  There is plenty of lively discussion peercointalk.org regularly discussing potential vulnerabilities in PPC.  I have a lot of faith in Sunny King, sigmike and the PPC project.  PPC was obviously first in the PoS world.  Just as many alts come and go based on BTC, so will the PPC clones.
I also found it funny that line 3 (below) of the original PPC code was removed in CLOAK (Though there are references to // ppcoin alll over the place...

Nice cop out.  No I'm not saying that, but I wouldn't be surprised if we get close.  $300 seems to be the battleground and IMO to expect that battle to be over would be setting yourself up for disappointment. For the record I expect it to happen and I expect the bulls to win.  I would also be happy to skip it all together and leave the $300s in history.

I'm not at all saying the complaints are made by bots.  And i'm definitely not saying this is not a real, valid complaint.
Included in this great debate is a lot of speculation over plays to manipulation public opinion.  This is an interesting post to study since it misleadingly strikes a chord.  It takes a very simple view on a very complex problem.  It uses a the word 'reasonable' which is highly subjective.  And it misrepresents the real problem, which is scaling at the cost of decentralization.

Interesting comment and made me think: In some respects bitcoin has sort of a built in "scam", but one that is benevolent.  Those driven to mine do so out of some mixture of motivation to profit and motivation to support the network, but usually more (or entirely) for the profit.  By miners "crossing their fingers" to break even, we have people drawn to the "scam" only to ultimately act in support of the network. 
Of course this is the genius of blockchain consensus, people get "scammed" into mining and the benefactor of the "scam" is everyone!

I am not a big fan NXT but there is a lot of bad information floating around about PoS.  As implemented in Peercoin it there are no proven flaws and is arguably more secure than Bitcoin.  Do some research and you will find that every theoretical vulnerability in Peercoin's PoS algorithm has been debunked.

My opinion is that bitcoin is decentralized "enough" at this time.  It is a hard thing to measure and there a lots of different opinions.  It is also my opinion that increasing the blocksize will increase centralization and doing so should not be done lightly.  A small increase is probably OK.

How is the valuation of traditional currency any different/better?
@_date: 2015-01-02 18:42:56


When it comes to currency, I think this is true.  Going further, blockchain tech has opened the door for consensus algorithms that were previously thought to be impossible.  All of a sudden there is a whole new field in computer science where studying blockchain tech opens up thinking in how consensus can be reached without a central party.  With this mindset, cryptocurrency is an example of a decentralized service, but not the only one.  Some examples I can think of are Tor, OpenBazaar, Diaspora and the PirateBrowser.  AirBnB and Uber are examples of hybrid models that emphasize the power of p2p and there is very little centralized risk.


....and send it to any other party...!


I disagree.  Any sources to back this up?  I don't think it can be proved one way or another.
@_date: 2014-12-08 20:12:50


This is always true (and frustrating) no matter what community your talking about.  But this is OK here because if bitcoin sees another exponential level of adoption/price increase, the trojan horse analogy becomes a very real possibility.

Thanks for sharing.  I watched this and I agree with the reasoning and certainly would appreciate having the banks and major payment processors not using the resources that they are, but I think if successful, the usage from the bitcoin network will dwarf this without efficient mining rig design.  Unfortunately the Proof of Work incentive does nothing to encourage maximizing generation of hashes at any expense.
The date the video was made:
April 8th 2013 = 60 Th/s = 15 MW (There were no units of time on the energy usage, I assume MW/h which makes sense compared to 7-8 Wind Turbines)
Assuming the same rate of hash to power consumption:
Feb 9th 2014 = 18,000 Th/s = 4.5 GW/h ...ok wow thats high, lets assume things are 2x more efficient now, that's still 2.25 GW/h and equal to the power output of a large coal burning power plant.
I would guess that at $10,000/BTC we match the corporated output of those entities it is intended to replace.  What about at $100,000/BTC?  If Bitcoin intends to replace them then it must scale to this rate.  Here is where I see problems.
I will continue to do research.  Since my original comment, I have thought of some things that would have the opposite effect:
-Coin halving rate.  Will we reach the end of coin halving or at least a low enough reward before the network becomes to Watt hungry?  Maybe.
-Limit on rate increase: Maybe at some point the race to make money of mining becomes so cost prohibitive that it doesn't grow that much?  But then that makes me think that only rich people can mine and that power will consolidate into it's own other problem for Bitcoin.
Anyway, I'm off to research more about Peercoin to defend my other point.

I guess my overall point is that the model is the same in both cases.  Using your probabilities for the "old model" you are making assumptions that nodes are honest.  Nothing is stopping a node from using RBF and advertising that their node is running a version of core that didn't include RBF.  As soon as you have to trust anyone or anything besides the consensus protocol you are relying on properties and forces outside of bitcoin.  You can use social pressure to censor bad nodes, but this opens up the same can of worms that decentralized applications aim to close.  I am not saying people should not devise bitcoin + risk models to accept zero-conf, but I am saying that this is a solution not solely using bitcoin.
This conversation brings up a point I have been doing some thinking on recently: Proof of executing binary code signature.  If there was a way to prove to the network that you were running code with a specific signature/hash then peers could easily and trustlessly know that a node is running RBF or not, then we could add this type of knowledge to a sound risk model.  When nodes are running on top of a blockchain (Ethereum?), I think we will be able to do this.

Absolutely!  I see decentralized networks as a way to cultivate truth (within a certain scope).  We are witnessing the exploration of a new frontier, that of implicit trust.  The block size debate at times feels hopeless, but I think it is a valuable exercise in truth discovery, so all ideas, popular or not, are valuable.

GAW controls private keys which can be used to start a PayCoin minting wallet which can produce coinstake^1 transactions at up to 350 times the reward of a regular node.  Source here:
Here you can see the original Peercoin code (that the above is a fork of) showing that all nodes receive a 1%/year coinstake reward:
 
Additionally GAW has violated the MIT open source license by failing to retain the proper copyright holders for their reused Peercoin code.  See my post on HashTalk here:

Mining a non-confirmed transaction is not a double spend even if it replaces a tx with the same input(s) because the replaced transaction has not been spent (and will not be spent until it has at least one confirmation).  Making this assumption is a fallacy.  Making this assumption to force bitcoin to work in retail environment is a bigger fallacy.  You could say that it "works" given an appropriate risk model, but this is not an inherit property of bitcoin.

This issue has been discussed here:
By default a client will reject a second block seen using the duplicate stake input (minting multiple chains)
Again there is no incentive to minting multiple chains, you will earn your 1% on way or another.  If you want to modify your client to accept chains with duplicate stake input, you can, but you certainly cannot count on the network to accept them.

Isn't the blocksize limit is already user-configurable since it is trivial to change?  It would be foolish to do so without overwhelming consensus.  What makes emergent consensus any different? and why force the issue when there are obvious difference of opinions?


One of the fundamental differences of opinion is that many, including me, believe larger blocks with lead to centralization.  Users are cautious about any upgrade, even SegWit, and they should be.  I believe in a layer-1 that maximizes decentralization at any cost, including the cost of scalability within that layer.  Yes, not all people agree with me, and the majority of core support has splintered into more support for BU. This seems very natural as the community as a whole works to find consensus about the future.  We bumped into the limit and fees have risen, of course some people are going to be unhappy.  So now the bitcoin world gets to see what consensus is REALLY about, and the only choice we have is how we achieve it: peacefully or violently.

You are right it is not an upgrade, it is a coordination method.  And yes any coordination method, including UASF, can result in a fork.  It is important to note that with a UASF, the only way a hard fork can occur is if miners not in support of the SF intentionally mine bad blocks (which is risky for their bottom line).  Never has there been as much contention over the next upgrade.  Without compromise or stagnation, a fork is inevitable.

Xthin sounds great as you describe, I will look into it more.  Segwit increases capacity, provides many optimizations and is ready to go, I imagine you have heard the supporting arguments so I won't repeat them.
I disagree that core is "holding the bitcoin network hostage". While it is impossible to say with 100% certainty, node data and statements of support made by members of the bitcoin economy suggest that the majority does not feel this way.
Bitcoin is permissionless and It's great that projects like BU exist.  Bitcoin is a consensus system which was designed to handle disagreements among peers.  This will happen regardless, the only control the users have is whether it happens gracefully or violently.  If BU is what the majority wants, then consensus will converge around it. But, I don't believe it ever will and agree with jonny1000 that the approach that BU takes is hostile.

As the Bitcoin network matures it becomes more centralized because mining pools consolidate.  You will be hearing about the very real threat of 51% attacks on Bitcoin for the rest of it's life.  Meanwhile Peercoin becomes more secure daily and this evident because the devs are taking steps to remove checkpointing in the next release (0.5 will see an opt-out function in the wallet, a later release will see the checkpointing function removed altogether).  Also note that bitcoin has an alert system for emergency situations, which is a form of centralization. From  "Only alerts that are signed by a specific ECDSA public key are considered valid. A copy of the private key is held by at least Satoshi, Gavin, and theymos"
Bitcoin's PoW has an initial advantage over Peercoin in network security at the genesis block. Bootstrapping security into PoS requires checkpoints because a young network is highly susceptible to 51% DDoS attacks.  As the network matures it becomes more decentralized and the security offered by the greater number of minters allows for checkpointing to be removed.

As an aside: I am very big on Bitcoin and don't believe Peercoin to be superior.  I believe Bitcoin will survive many attempts on it's life and always be "first".

This is great and will probably be lost in the the price mania.
I read a great idea a while back here (4th paragraph):
Basically with RBF and CPFP if someone double spends you, you can spend the original tx to miners with 100% fee and the double spend will have a high probability of getting dropped.  This essentially maks 0-conf txs secure.  You loose your BTC, but you screw over the fraudster and over all create a disincentive to try to scam the network.

The reason proof of work works is because people are greedy and want to maximize profit.  Sometimes it is to a miners' advantage to publish a block before they have transactions to add.  Until block reward sufficiently diminishes, empty blocks are basically a sign of network health.  The more participation in mining, the better the network.  By extension you could say, the more aggressive/efficient the mining is, the better the network.
This comment below explains why a miner would release an empty block:

Assuming your scenario:
 * Cheaper use cases will be temporarily priced out, as is the bitcoin design
 * Moving money from an exchange is worth a higher fee
 * Holding coins on exchanges far riskier for other reasons.

Reddit is a silly place :)

You don't get it. Bitcoin is for permission-less payments. There are much better systems in place for transacting under the Governments approval.
@_date: 2016-11-19 19:51:21
This is good example how the vocal minority wreck havoc on communities.  Most people are happy to be part of something revolutionary in just about any capacity while a small percentage wage a war with each other making it look like we are divided.
The trust problem is not solved yet, but bitcoin is a major step towards allowing honest people to kick dishonest people to the curb.  I'm not 100% defending Bitfinex here, how can I know 100% for sure that everything Zane mentions here is true or even said under free will.  But I certainly know that our trust and gullibility are constantly being played and we need to stop allowing those with a loudest voice to be considered the most trustworthy.

I don't follow. This seems like an attempt to trip people up without offering any real information to digest.  Even if the accusations are false, the methodologies and counter strategies are real and should be considered in the current situation.
@_date: 2017-04-11 17:27:09
I'm open to learning more about this but at first glance it seems like quite a stretch. Lets give it a shot:
 * Is bitcoin a scarce resource in which multiple owners have the "right to individually exclude others from it's use"?
Yes, definitely.
 * Does this make it so no one has an "effective privilege of use?"
* Are "new property rights are being defined and allocated without mechanisms for resolving ownership disputes?"
The creation of witness/extension blocks could be considered new rights, but they seem to me to have clear mechanisms for resolving ownership disputes.
* Is bitcoin focused "unduly on the clarity of rights?"
No, Bitcoin's aims to be as decentralized as possible and thus has a low barrier of entry. (This is the main argument against on-chain scaling)
@_date: 2017-04-04 05:10:45
Yes, I totally agree.  Maybe I missed the part about anyone demanding support.  And what if a subset of opt-in users want to use extension blocks?
@_date: 2017-04-11 17:50:28
Yes, growing too fast or too uneven is not sustainable.  The resulting drop in value from bad growth is exactly what bitcoin needs to survive.  In the meantime Bitcoin gets the work it needs while the cycle repeats until good growth outweighs the bad.

@_date: 2016-05-24 03:51:28
If the hash rate of the network dropped by half, we would see 20 minute on average blocks.  This would last for one difficulty adjustment period, or approximately 4 weeks (if the drop happened at the same time as a difficulty re-target).
It seems unlikely that we would see anything near half of the network shut off at the halving.

Current proposed decentralized sidechain methods are not available in bitcoin at this time, so a federated peg (requiring trust) is the only way.  Rootstock is planning to migrate to OP_CHECK_VOTES_VERIFY or OP_WITHDRAWALPROOFVERIFY+OP_REORGPROOFVERIFY if either of these become available to provide a decentralized 2-way peg.
When decentralized sidechains become a reality it is going blow everyone's minds.

It seems possible that circle, gemini, coinbase and others are in part a business model to create market liquidity for absurd amounts of coins held by early adopters.
@_date: 2016-05-17 22:03:42
This makes no sense to me.
@_date: 2016-05-24 05:19:43
My understanding is that during the re-target, the amount of time it took to create the last 2016 blocks is compared against the expected time (10 minutes * 2016 blocks = 14 days) and then the difficulty is adjusted up or down by the same percentage.
The step size is always 2016 blocks.  So say 99% of hash power was shut down 1008 blocks after a re-target (and stayed this way), the network would see 1000 minute blocks for 1008 more blocks.  There is a limit of the re-target by a factor of 4 either way so in this scenario, the re-target would adjust the difficulty by 1/4 and if the hash power continued at the 1/100th rate, the next 2016 blocks would be solved on average every 250 minutes.
As alarming as this sounds, its pretty much impossible considering how much money is there for the taking.

I tend to agree, I haven't seen enough red post the rise from 1000 to 3000 for my liking.  With the uncertainty around Aug 1st (not for me, but for others) I say dump it.
But, I'll be watching the double bottom bounce at 2050 (which just happened a few minutes ago) closely, this has potential to be the bottom if the market has enough bull steam.

It is hard to take your story as truth at face value, but damn thats awesome....maybe I will get into mining one day, and maybe you can give me some advice.

It seems likely that the most of the signals for BU are fake.  (Meaning they are running non-BU software but using a BU coinbase text). My reasoning is based on the 3 times that about 3/4 of BU nodes were knocked off the network due to a remote exploit.  In all cases normal mining operations signalling BU have not been affected.
If true, it is of course possible that their intention is to start really running BU if it activates. But with the history of crashes, I can't see miners wanting to risk it.

The bubble will burst but the fragility is in human nature and its tendency for exuberance, not in bitcoin.
The top is hard to predict, but I don't think we are there yet. The floor of the next bear market will probably be close to 1000.

Directly, it doesn't.  "Accredited Investors" (defined as having a $200,000 yearly income or $1m net worth) buy shares of the BIT (Bitcoin Investment Fund) run by Second Market.  After holding BIT shares for a year they are eligible to convert them for sale as GBTC.  So the real question is how does Second Market get their BTC and to that I don't know the answer.
If I had to guess, BIT/GBTC was setup partly for the purpose of creating liquidity for enormous amount of BTC some individual or group mined early on.

But your comment about the bubble isn't entirely off.  Bitfinex customers for some time have not been able to withdraw USD, which is very much like the Mt. Gox scenario during the Nov 2013 bubble.  Its likely that that effect isn't as big a deal because there are plenty of other exchanges, but still people wanting to cash out on bitfinex does mean rising prices on other exchanges.

It is this dude....right NOW. 
And you forgot to emphasize the PEER TO PEER part, which is where its censorship resistant properties come from....you just ignore this when deciding that the blockchain should grow by 10GB+ a month making it less accessible to people lower on the economic scale.  The CASH part hasn't been forgotten and is working exactly as described in the white paper.  Including the part where by the time the last significant halving occurs, miner revenue must come entirely from fees.

It's not fair to call people trolls because the disagree with the compromise. Many people believe that the blocksize increase is unnecessary and risky.  There is good evidence and computer science best practices to support this (remember when people only had 4k of RAM or less to work with? Efficiency &gt; bloat). But we can argue all day about the merits of either side and in the end miners only represent ~1/5 of economic majority.  Without greater support from Exchanges, Service Providers, Developers and Users, miner activated segwit2x would cause a chain split.
I personally am willing to support SegWit2x if more of bitcoin's economic members come forward with support.

Fuck yeah.  I'm so fucking sick of hearing people talk about how "something will replace bitcoin" because in their mind it's not scaling.  They ignore the fact that the whole god damn purpose is to transfer stores of value without centralized, bought out governance.  Honestly, if you are reading this right now and are holding bitcoin because you think its some cool, instant, get my fucking coffee in the morning by waving my magic smartphone wallet then, unless you also understand the value of censorship resistant currency, you should sell all your coins now.  Sell them to someone who understands the extent of our fucked up economic slavery.  Sorry for all the cursing, I'm fucking drunk.

Bitcoin is a consensus protocol and not everyone agrees on the best way to scale.  It is commonly said that are 5 major economic groups, none of which have the power by themselves to make consensus change: Miners, Developers, Exchanges, Service Providers and End Users.  This post is saying that the miners are supporting the SegWit2x proposal which activates SegWit (Segregated Witness) and also increases the blocksize to 2MB.  SegWit is an efficiency upgrade that solves many scalability challenges and works with the existing 1MB blocksize limit.
Miner support alone is not enough to activate segwit2x without a chain split but it is possible that this showing of miner support could sway the other economic groups to support it.

I have used Clipperz as my primary password manager for over 2 years.  Incidentally I also first learned about bitcoin on their website.  I have found it to be an invaluable part of my toolkit as an on-the-go IT consultant.  The code is open source so you can run your own service if you want, but using their hosted service is simple and secure.  I occasionally download an updated offline copy in case there is a problem with their site.
One thing though, if you are listening Clipperz, I do think you should adjust your yearly fees. I believe the BTC/USD rate has gone up about 1000% since I first saw the Clipperz's price chart.
