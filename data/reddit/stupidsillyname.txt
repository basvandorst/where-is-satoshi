Trouble is, I have an American account (US funds) that I wanted to link to Coinbase. Can't have it all, I suppose. Thanks for the tip!

Actual advice starts 9 minutes in. Basically, risk management (knowing the market will likely enter long bear trend) and learning how to short when it does. 
Edit: doesn't actually tell you how to short.

What would be the reason not to keep your btc in breadwallet and then recover them later using seed, if necessary? 
I'm only asking because I don't want to keep downloading more and more wallet apps before my trezor arrives. 
(Does blockchain wallet have this same issue?)

Not OP. I spoke with my bank about this before I sent a wire to kraken. I was told I have no control over the pathway. I sent a wire on Friday, now I'm expecting similar news in a few days :/

I'm still very new to this, so I have a question. Even if you keep your bitcoin in a wallet, you'd still need to transfer to an exchange for a withdrawal, correct? So you can potentially face the problem of not being able to cash out in a volatile situation (if the exchange freezes up, for example). You have control over your bitcoin....until you want to sell it. Then you need the exchange again. What am I missing? Any clarification will be most appreciated!

Freaking same. Canada. Newb here who wanted to buy in at 3500. I'm a hodler, so I still hope to have gains, but....could have had so much more and that's frustrating since there's nothing I can do! Gonna try that bitaccess link in the meantime..

If the plan is to hodl (for years), is hardware wallet still preferable to cold storage?  I have read that paper wallets can be compromised easily (when transferring).  So in your opinion, the hardware wallet is the "idiots guide" to crypto security, yes? 
Thanks for your help.

Ok fair enough. I just feel like a sucker when others are paying 20 cent transaction fees ha. My main concern is being able to purchase more bitcoin at a time. I'm currently limited to approximately $200 per week.

Still have to read this entire thread to learn more, but I'm swamped at work. As a preliminary, i was planning on buying a brand new iPad (need one anyway) to transfer my coin to cold storage. Does this minimize my vulnerability, presumably since there would be a lack of malware? What other exposures should I be concerned about (and how can I stave them off)?
 I'm still eagerly learning more about the topic before I fully invest. All advice is appreciated. Thanks

I completely agree. My plan is to invest what I can right now and hodl long term. Thanks for clearing that up for me. (Although the question remains, who's to say Coinbase won't freeze your deposit once you transfer it back to sell it? Guess there's no way around that)

I'm having a lot of difficulty finding one in Canada (with reasonable fees and wait times), not to mention one that offers the purchase of altcoins

I see sooo many posts about wallets, and they are increasingly getting more inflammatory, purporting that unless you are some genius computer whiz, there is no way your coins are safe anywhere. 
 As a total non computer-whiz, what are some legitimate options to keep my coins safe? Trusted resources, articles, helpful advice greatly appreciated. I'm still waiting to jump in until I know I can keep my investment safe.

I was thinking that when it comes time to transfer coins to and from hardware wallet, I would use a brand new and designated iPad (or what about iPod??) or laptop for solely this purpose. What do you think of this strategy? Does this cutdown security risk? 
@_date: 2017-08-22 00:56:43
Damn. Just bought the Trezor (right before that article on security breach came out). Still haven't received package, maybe it's not too late to get Ledger 
@_date: 2017-08-28 03:11:32
I'm talking about wiring to kraken 
@_date: 2017-08-13 01:33:44
So I just found out today that in Canada you can't link your bank account to Coinbase so you have to use credit/debit..for a 3.99% fee. Not to mention the weekly limits! 
Anyone know how I can get cheaper (and larger) transactions in Canada? 
@_date: 2017-09-02 14:12:55
Tried kraken as well - terrible. Cannot fund my account. 
Coinbase has high fees and terrible limits. 
Been reading the various subreddits for days now...what is a good exchange for Canadians?? One that verifies quickly and accepts funding quickly (this is important!). Preferable if it sold altcoins as well. 
Been using coinsquare, but the rates are beyond horrendous. If the price of bitcoin is 4500, I'm paying close to 4700..plus the fees on top of that! 
Anyway, sorry for the rant. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!
