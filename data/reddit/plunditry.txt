Binance for crypto, Gemini for exchanging BTC to USD

What currency or form of payment would you pay taxes in?

Do you disagree with the argument or just think he presented it poorly?

Newer mining hardware lowers the cost of mining 1BTC down to $3,900 in some cases. That's what I'm worried about. Setting aside the cost of energy which can only shift a few %, compute power can increase dramatically.

Is there a concern that as the cost of mining declines (cheaper energy, better hardware, etc), this could adversely affect the price?

think of it this way: Fidelity can invest in Bitcoin on behalf of its customers (who have a lot of money) bu\\y buying a Bitcoin ETF on the Nasdaq, where they already buy all their other ETFs (no additional work needed for Fidelity), INSTEAD OF having buy it from an exchange like Coinbase or Gemini.

I believe capital gains are currently measured in terms of USD.

Ah, this. The complexity going up is what I was missing, makes sense - thanks!

Do you have to pay taxes on profits if you use your BTC to purchase things directly in bitcoin from vendors who accept it? i.e. never converting it back to USD.

yeah if by losing dominance you actually meant gaining dominance, then you would be 100% correct.
@_date: 2017-11-04 16:26:07
great logic

Adoption by consumers.
Innovation by developers.
Acceptance by governments.

If you are in the US, use Coinbase to buy BTC with USD, then transfer your BTC to Binance where you can either hold it, or trade it for dozens of alt coins. Binance also has a crypto called USDT (Tether) which is effectively like selling BTC back to USD.

they allow margin trading which contributes to the inflated figures, apples &amp; oranges

Thanks for sharing! Serious question: could someone explain the value of a log chart vs a normal one, especially as it relates to bitcoin?
