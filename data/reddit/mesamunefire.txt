I was a contractor only until recently (Contract turned into a job offer with health care so I took it). 
I have not made any money off bitcoin contracting yet. I tried Coinality and got no call backs or contacts at all despite applying to about 20-30 different jobs that I was qualified for. Compare that to Craigslist, which I sent out 10 applications in one week and got back with 4 businesses. Linkedin has a better record as well. 
Anyone get positions or and I just an outlining variable here?

Basic LAMP setup. Linux, Apache, Mysql, and PHP. 
I can front 20$ a month on the project if no donations (probably can upgrade if needed with donations). 
You can get a turnkey solution here: 
or I can install manually. I would prefer debian with at least 300 MB RAM and a decent processor. Best case, I get SSH access (and whoever else is involved in the project). 
I do this kind of stuff as my job so let me know if you have any other questions. 
EDIT: are you guys here? 
@_date: 2014-03-13 16:30:55
I have experience in making mediawiki sites and administration. 
I can think of a few features that would be awesome (like linking to area specific services in other websites, showing the price and how to get it easier, better category descriptions, ect..)
Let me know if there is an interest.
EDIT: Also if anyone knows of a LAMP cloud server company that accepts Bitcoin, that would be great. I plan on just using my provider if there is any interest. 
EDIT2: Anyone think of a good name? can be a .com or other just not taken.

The only thing that might limit the Pi as a controller is how fast it can send the data to/from the ASIC miner. The CPU/RAM/HD speed may be a factor here. Then again, the most likely slowest component is the internet connection itself at that point.

Mostly for OP, but I am glad you got something out of it. I found out the best way to make money is to not look at it for a while and not do micro-trading. I am using bitcoin as intended, a payment model. 
As far as the programming goes, the usual algorithms were used during 2008 when the stock market went down quite a bit. We all start out with $10,000 and used various algorithms to find out which would make the best decisions to make the most money. Turns out the (P)LSA algorithm makes terrible financial decisions, but we kind of figured that. I think I had $100 left?

Just a warning, the hard drive speed and the processor speed is the limit on how fast the computer can run. So if you are running a lot of internet connections and threads though the FPGA for mining, you might see a slowdown equivalent to the max hard drive/processor speed.

Ah well in that case, I can give you an example on the BBB :) 
I reported Apple after the store did not honor the 2 year warranty. There was damage to the underside of my Macbook Pro from overheating. I took it in and they would not replace/fix the underside of the computer. I called up the main office and they told me the same thing. So I reported them to the BBB. After a week, I got a call from Apple stating that I would have to pay 150$ for the replacement. My wife ended up looking at the contract and found a portion that specifically stated they had to replace overheating issues and we reported that to the BBB. BBB gave me a call and asked if I wanted to be part of a class action lawsuit for the overheating issue. I told them yes.
Another week goes by and Apple gives me a call and asks where they can send the replacement part for no fee. They even paid for the shipping. 
I will not be buying from apple again.

Original thread here: 
The biggest problem with bitcoin is trading with a company you know very little about. The BBB or Better Bitcoin Bureau hopes to fix this issue by:
1) Making issues transparent for both the consumer and the business
2) Advertizing good business while shunning the ones with bad reputations
3) Accountability of companies that use/are based on bitcoin.
Feel free to add companies you feel are important to the bitcoin community. 
@_date: 2013-04-19 22:44:30
Sounds great! Perhaps we can talk about integration with our subreddit? @_date: 2013-04-17 23:39:21
I was just about to create it. Here is the decription I was thinking: 
Bitcoin BBB Consumer and Business Reviews, Reports, Ratings, Complaints and Accredited Business Listings
When posting:
1) Make a self post with the following information:
* Title: The company name (please first look to see if the company name is already posted.)
* Description: Name of company, website URL, any additional info you think relevant for those reviewing the company.
In the comments, write your complaint about the company and follow up if they respond. Please consider up-voting the company if they helped you out/responded in a positive manner.
On the sidebar, put the companies that have proven themselves to the mods that do not have any outstanding issues.
@_date: 2013-04-17 23:32:03

As much as I would love the Raspberry pi to power these machines, I feel the processor, Ethernet, and other components are going to slowdown the potential for the ASIC miners. I plan on trying it out of course (and was able to get the litecoin miner working on the raspberry pi), but it will probably prove to be not profitable.

This is to be seen. The video of the unit makes me skeptical to the "scam" portion or BFL. They might have some bad business practices (a huge amount of them), but they are giving statements out and units for pretesting. They also have accepted refunds, although again this is sporadic and against what they say on the website (as in they say no refunds, but then accept them when asked). 
Again not defending them, but they do seem like a business. Of course, if anyone is in arbitration with them, or have any issues regarding them, feel free to add to the BBB thread with ButterFly Labs. 
@_date: 2013-11-04 03:01:05

A good link to Coinbase security: 
Its recommended to split up your bitcoin between wallets (secure wallets) to minimize risks. Storing everything in Coinbase limits you to one company. That being said, the two-factor authentication helps in securing the bitcoin.

Yep. Actually the IRS will work with you either by phone or by other means. They work in other currency all the time, and are used to converting large sums. If you are small time, you may not even pay taxes on your bitcoin gains, but you can get in trouble for never reporting them. In order for bitcoin to have any legitimacy, being a taxable currency would help tremendously. 
Stock market brokers have to report their gains/losses and bitcoin day traders should do the same. The question that needs to be ironed out is how this is to go about.

"For those individuals that are somewhat knowledgeable about Bitcoin, what do you think holds them back from becoming community members (users, merchants, traders, etc.)?"
I believe that we as a community need to have more **transparency** between customers/investors and the companies associated. Companies are messing around with money and going under when they are making very risky decisions that effect real people. The US BBB takes care of this function but does not care of bitcoin users. 
A few like minded individuals like myself had the idea yesterday to create and it already has 50 new members. We are hoping to expand to other companies and have a "recommended" page of recommended businesses.
