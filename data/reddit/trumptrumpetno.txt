Or people have moved on to better coins and now one btc is worth about 10 bucks

Even a nuclear war would leave some survivors. As always people are short-sighted. 50 pshhh let's talk a million years.

You also don't have any proof of your idea

Because people hurt themselves. I would pay God to control my sugar addiction.

Surely you would have made money with 1 day candles too. The volume slowed down at the top.

That's not a healthy world and the majority agrees with me, except this subreddit.

Big Brother is a very popular show. We like the entertainment

How much does bot trading differ from professional traders?
@_date: 2018-02-24 21:17:41
I sold at 9.6. People here talked about it dropping to 8k so that's why I sold

You also don't have any proof of your idea
@_date: 2018-02-24 14:35:48
What is that?

Where's the trillion? I only see 10 million

It's a lot easier to just give money away then check every little detail. If you decide to donate money for schools that can still mean a whole million different things.

What's the point of the long socks?
@_date: 2018-04-20 18:46:05
By soon you mean 100 years?
@_date: 2018-04-20 09:51:24
I guess that's not a bad idea if you trust people.
