Funny that the thumbnail is an ad for Linode.  A fortune in BTC was stolen from their customers.

That would be more meaningful if it were signed. :)

You are buying something for $200 that you have no idea what it is or what to do with it?
@_date: 2014-09-28 10:24:59
Not sure if you are serious, but you should be comparing the utility of the amount of bitcoins sent (i.e. current exchange rate) not just the amount of BTC.

I understand rolling for randomness, but how do you go from the random bits you get to a keypair?
@_date: 2014-01-13 19:28:40
Ah, that makes sense then.  Sending is easier than retrieving I think, at least with MultiBit.

That's going to reduce key space unless you interpret the dice as literal bytes.

Google registration is a one time fee.  $25 I think.
If your app is open source I'd be happy to put it on Google market for you.

You hope he fills the blockchain with bullshit?
@_date: 2015-02-17 05:36:05


How is that, exactly?

At what price would you insta-buy one?  
@_date: 2013-12-16 13:56:45
I think you mean Far too many people on the internet are elitist dickholes, mostly towards newbies

Supporting the US federal government is ethical?

I do not appreciate the connotation that newcomers are "morons".

Not very good at reading, are you?
@_date: 2013-12-07 22:24:25


Think harder.
@_date: 2013-12-10 05:43:41
Interesting.  Do you have any references for this?
@_date: 2013-12-10 16:06:47
Just the most recent one.  
@_date: 2013-12-07 04:01:30
Pretty ignorant and stupid post.  Everyone who is new is trading?  
@_date: 2013-12-10 05:43:09


That is entirely false.  I have had no need to root any of my last three Android devices. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 22:26:43
Buy a $50 Android phone and write a simple Android app to pull in the prices. 
Honestly this could be done in a few hours.  If you seriously want this I could build a prototype for you for a reasonable price.

Why do people always do the opposite of what will really pay off?  It's buy low, sell high, not the other way around.  Or perhaps buy low, hold, rarely sell.  
I used the crash as an opportunity to pick up more BTC cheaply.  Do you think BTC will be worth more or less in one year, two, twenty?
