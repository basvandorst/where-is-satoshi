Playing devils advocate here: if he's not satoshi nakamoto then why did he reply as of he were? Couldn't he have just said I'm not that guy?

I'm willing to bet this was the course of events: 
Journalist figures out who the founder of bitcoins are, but does it in a way that cannot be reported. Off the record source, whatever. Double checks, does the legwork, confirms the Otr source.
Talks to founder, but cannot get him to say very much at all. Not enough to print with
Then decides to try and Sinatra it, report on everyone and everything around him so that they have enough material to fill up word count and also to salvage the story. She reveals her methods of contacting him for this reason too. Word count and also because she wants to point out how reclusive this guy is.
The point of the story is in the headline: I FOUND THE ORIGIN OF BITCOIN. Everything after that is whipped cream on top. 
Also the majority if journalists don't understand doxxing. The older they are, the least likely they would. For them, the idea of personal security isn't their problem. If those people have a ton of money, they have the means to protect themselves.

Email his editor. Making up quotes for sources is a big no-no. 
edit: even taking quotes out of context is also a big no-no actually. Misrepresenting a source is huge and can cost someone their job.

I'm not too familiar with coding so a lot of that stuff is over my head, but to me this read like someone who isn't a great writer wrote down something as a sort of "stream of consciousness", or writing down whatever he's thinking without structure.

Why the skepticism regarding the accuracy of his quote? This is what i don't understand, We have three parties present during that interview. The repoter, Nakamoto, and the sheriff's department. Of the three, the Sheriffs are the only party without their own agenda. What reason would they have to lie? 
It may very well be that Dorian was confused and misspoke, or it may very well be that there's more to this story that we're getting here. But if you look at it objectively, we have 2 out of the 3 parties who were there saying that what was quoted was accurate.
