reddit is here to upvote good posts and downvote bad ones. This way good gox posts should go up and bad ones will go down. But with this attitude I will start upvoting every gox post I see, sorry.

It's returning a static empty page (with an interesting comment) and the API ist still (partially) up (  If gox is sincere they might still process fiat withdrawals as usual.

I recommend jumping from a bridge, with a bungee rope.

I think that "Crisis Strategy Draft" is fake:
"The reality is that MtGox can go bankrupt at any moment, and *certainly
deserves to as a company*."
Why would mtgox write such a thing in such a document?
"The cold storage has been wiped out due to a leak in the hot wallet."
What? That's nonsense. If the hot wallet is empty, someone must refill it manually from the cold wallet. I can't imagine that they'll get all the coins out of cold storage without any suspicion of a problem. If they did, that would have been negligent and probably a criminal offence.
Also the talk about replacing the management reminds me of   .
I suspect someone wants to damage mtgox, e.g. to further lower the price or because she is angry at mtgox.

If we take over the exchange, will we be liable with our private property if hackers steal our customers funds?

If you are &lt;18 they may verify an account at an exchange and transfer fiat in/out of it for you.

IMHO there's enough information in the pic to brute force through the ambiguity if someone is capable and determined.

The lines in your work are too long, so I didn't read them. Hate scrolling horizontally.

If they include just dummy transactions or none at all in blocks noone can use bitcoin any more and btc value will go to 0. We might be able to work around that, but it'll be a great disaster.
OTOH a lot of ppl invested a lot in btc, so I'm not sure they would want to offend their citizens like this. However, if kidnappers discover btc or "the government" fakes kidnappings or does real ones etc. the public opinion might turn agains btc, the government could announce plans to shut down btc, give ppl some time to withdraw from btc, it could happen.

We'd get another 25 btc within about 10 minutes and could continue with that. Besides, not everyone would sell their btc.

USA outlaws bitcoins. Mining declines. NSA does a 50+% attack on the block chain. Bitcoin drops to 0.
