Is there anything similar for a Ledger Nano S?  The passphrase feature of the Trezor looks awesome!
EDIT: Yes it does exist.   [

Not exactly... Blockchain is the protocol, and bitcoin is an application that runs on the technology.    
Bitcoin is a digital token that solves the double-spending problem of digital assets.  Basically, it's a digital item that can be transferred between wallets, therefor having value and purpose.  Once BTC moves to a new wallet, it is no longer in the old wallet.  It cannot be dupilicated, and transactions can not be manipulated/hacked from a tech perspective.  User error (like not using 2FA, sharing a password, or exposing your wallet's private key) is the only way to lose your funds.    
BTC solves challenges faced by fiat currency, such as international transfers, inflation, and physically needing to carry paper bill and metal coins.  It's a new asset class, similar to physical gold, dollar bills, etc.  Believers in bitcoin believe this early adoption phase will likely create generational wealth, whereas skeptics believe it's a fad, or that the the blockchain will be broken/hacked and make the tokens worthless.    
From a trading perspective, it's highly volatile and large swings are common.  Best practice is to only invest money you are able to lose completely, and to develop a trading strategy, whether that be short term or long term, and stick to it.
