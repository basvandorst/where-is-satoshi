"This is what American entrepreneurs should be working on" is a great way to present the idea to the audience.

Why don't we just leave the up and downvotes as they are and spend more time posting memes and price announcements?

There has not been a great day for fiat since bitcoin was first released.

Any miner could implement these settings in their own client. They would be leaving money on the table and probably making it easier to spam out higher-fee paying transactions at a lower cost, but hashpower is free to include any set of valid transactions they'd like into the blocks they mine.
Here is a thread where Satoshi hints at doing the opposite: setting a maximum number of transactions per block that can be at a certain fee level (in this case 0 fee). [
This is another mechanic that could produce a working fee market... if different miners have different thresholds for the minimum fee/kB they'll allow into their own mined blocks. If you want 100% surety your transaction is valid for the next block, you'll have to set a fee/kB that is higher than all miners will accept. Yet you could still pay a fee that is higher than say 75% of the miners have chosen, and be considered for inclusion in 75% of the future blocks that are mined.

I feel bad for you and the others in this sub... who when BTC is being used in the future will think of this as a bad thing and attribute it to some "they" who is attacking.
Never mind the fact that hard forking the chain to a larger block size limit would make it harder and more expensive to "spam" the chain until real transactions are priced out, by a factor far larger than the block size increase.

I am speaking specifically about BTC, so I don't know why you are talking about shitcoins.
One way to make it harder for spam to price out other transactions is to raise the block size limit. This will increase the cost of attacking the chain with spam by a factor that is a multiple of the factor you raise the block size.
The cost of spam required to price out transactions with a given fee rate is equal to the residual block space that is not filled with "real" transactions of that fee rate. So bigger blocks make it more expensive and harder to spam.

I am a bitcoiner first, so there you go. I don't know who "you guys" means to you. And I do love forking, I was told forks were the way to improve the BTC protocol as needs evolved.
The creator and first designer of bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto, liked the idea of phasing in a larger block size limit at a given block height once transactional throughput on the chain started to near the 1MB cap. Using a hard fork, of course.

Sorry but you should have used lightning don't you know BTC is only for certain kinds of transactions?

I'm not sure exactly I was being sarcastic unfortunately :(.
