Doesn't seem like we can. I think they will try and get as much from this as they can. Once they are happy they will just close the website and run. Wex.nz did the exact same thing last year.

Buy a hardware wallet. Save yourself the hassle man.

I lost 30k USD in a hack last month. Its a horrible feeling, but life goes on. Look to the future and try to stay positive. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:23:15
You will have the private keys, generated and stored on the hardware wallet. With absolutely no chance of getting hacked etc.. With a laptop there is a still a chance.. Save yourself the nightmare. I had 30k stolen from me last month. You don't want to wake up one morning to a 0 balance. Goodluck man!

Good luck with that. I don't think you would get very far. Have a look at crypsy and mtgox. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 11:10:26
This is epic!

Yes, it could have been avoided if I had a hardware wallet. The sick thing is I had full intentions of ordering one, just didn't have cash at that current time(2 babies and in between jobs). Shit sucks. But its a lesson. Owning a hardware wallet, regardless of the amount of crypto you own, IMO, is imperative.

Same position as you mate. Account is now "temporarily disabled". 5hey requested proof of funds after I tried to withdraw from my account, which I provided immediately back to FIAT. No reply back from them.

Had miners setup at home. Used remote desktop to access them. Google account compromised. �� Should have used a HW wallet, I know. I've purchased a ledger now and I am going to build up what I lost. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 01:04:32
And yes, I have learned from it. Purchased a ledger and slowly clearing my presence online. Live and learn. :)

Pretty sure that was Ether.

Any update on this situation? 
The exact same thing happened to me. Funds/account frozen.

Ouch. Good luck op. Upvoted for visibility. Maybe repost in BTCDev(if there is a sub like that) or Bitcointalk.com.
@_date: 2017-11-09 17:22:01
Thanks for the tip man. I'll check it out. :)
@_date: 2017-11-06 13:08:18
Congrats man! Its great seeing genuine success stories like yours. All the best! Don't let it change who you are. :)
@_date: 2017-11-09 00:27:15
I don't know anybody personally that had trades in that day. Whoever it was became a millionaire instantly (many people also lost money). There were a few threads not so long after it happened about people that got lucky that morning. 
Imo, I think it's worth putting in a couple hundred euros for the off chance for it to happen again, but remember you will be competing with many others trying to do the same. :)
@_date: 2017-11-09 01:02:52
Yea, its a bummer alright. A life changing amount of money for me, considering my current personal situation. But hey, its crypto, hopefully we are still the early adopters(edit). Haha. ��
@_date: 2017-11-09 01:10:34
Thanks man. You too!
@_date: 2017-11-16 15:10:08
Where about is that? :)
@_date: 2017-11-09 16:18:59
It was actually bad luck with the whole KNC fiasco. Nobody really seen it coming. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 20:19:24
Didn't save the wallet file? O.o Ever tried getting your drives analyzed by professionals? It is 1 million $ after all.. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 00:41:04
The latter. I had invested in miners back in 2013, and subsequently got ripped off(KNC Titan Drama). Haven't had much luck in crypto. Haha. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 01:09:57
Damn. Yea the BTC ratio is getting hammered the last few months. :/
@_date: 2018-03-08 09:11:04
Well done man! Surprised somebody hasn't done this already. 
Definitely add Vitalik Buterin to the list.

Tbf, if he's in crypto that long then he surely has other accounts. Coinbase etc.. 
@_date: 2019-01-26 12:51:15
Really?? Jesus, sorry. 
@_date: 2018-02-17 19:17:03
Not that I have seen anyway. The current solution to the problem (which has worked for me anyway), is to use Bitpanda with Neteller and cash out as you need it. 
@_date: 2017-09-28 14:22:56
I was charged for sending an international payment not so long ago (5 euro was the amount I was sending), the amount charged was 15 euro. 
@_date: 2018-07-29 12:35:37
Also, you should have kept 2fa off. Then connect to your account with a tor node and claim it was hacked. ��
@_date: 2018-12-11 00:41:43
Yea, it was suspicious af. Multiple news outlets have already written articles about his post. lol..

Check the social media links. Same guy.

I noticed. And that has been posted so many times before..
