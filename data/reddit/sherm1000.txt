I still find it difficult to understand the full process of mining a block. Can you complete the following flowchart of algorithmic logic? what are the steps that should do after getting a lower hash than the target? 
1. Getting data of Version, previous blockhash, merkle root, time, bits from the blockchain
2. Concotenate all the above data and a nonce (Version + previous blockhash + merkle root + time + bits from the blockchain + nonce) --&gt; lets name this concotenated hash as "Header_hash"
3. Convert the above header hash to binary
4. Hash the above coverted binary with SHA256
5. Hash the above for the second time again with SHA256
6. Reverse the order of the hash and name it "Final Hash"
Let's say that we have successfully found a hash that is lower than the target and named it as "final hash"
so what are the other algorithmic logic steps after this point? (steps to merge coinbase transaction etc etc)

have watched it, it only doing the SHA256 only .. need full steps ;)

have read it, it's incomplete ;)

I can't stop laughing lol
