The answer depends on your risk tolerance.  
Low risk, pull out your initial investment and let the rest ride.  Pay a tax penalty for not holding for a year and earn less as price potentially rises.
High risk, hold and wait for 10x to compensate for the potential to lose your entire investment.
Very high risk, keep adding to your position but never more than your willing to lose.

The secret is to simply look away.  There was an experiment on children where they put a marshmallow in front of them and said if they could wait 2 minutes, they could have another.  The kids that succeeded didn’t have nerves of steel, they just were better at looking away.  The 2 marshmallow kids went on to be more successscul than the 1 marshmallow kids.

Diversifying is just as important but the point of holding isn’t that you are always going to be right, it’s that the gains from being right out weigh the profits of trading in and out.
Either way you don’t know the future but holding will earn you more than attempting to buy and sell every rally and correction.  That just creates more chances for you to be wrong and sell before a rally or buy right before a dip.

Do what you will but in the end it’ll be the investments you held for 30 years that determine your net worth not the sum of small trades.

Nobody knows the future but when it comes to some investments, you only need to be right once to retire ridiculously wealthy.
Looks like the price of Berkshire was $20 in the 1960s when that guy put down 10 grand.  I met him in the mid 2000s when Berkshire was at $100,000, so he probably had made around $50 million on that trade at that point.  I'm sure he was looking to cash out some soon because the guy was his 60s.  What's the point of millions of dollars if you aren't going to enjoy it?
