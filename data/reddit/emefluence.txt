Is this the same Silk Road I've heard about? The ebay for drugs / arms / weapons / contract killing / child porn etc?

Okay, fair enough, hardly conclusive though is it? There's a plausible sounding mechanism but no numbers.

All those things are (or could be) contraband but no matter. I still don't get the saving thousands of peoples lives claim?

The 16-yo woman in question responds in the comments and refutes the author...
"So first of all, everyone who worked has been given credit. I wrote a Quora answer on 22nd January clearly mentioning I paid $200 to my friend Harsh to build the backend. And recently, I paid him to build the caching server. Here's the link: 
He was not mentioned as a maker on Product Hunt, because he was not interested and didn't want to get notifications and be disturbed.
Coming to the iOS part, let me say this again, I coded everything on my own (with help from 2 mentors), along with designing and marketing. I have previously given the explanation for why the git log shows 19 commits from me and 79 commits from my mentor, Aviral. If you understand version control, even if you alter a string, you can make a commit and that'd be commits +=1."

Of course I'm going to take financial advice from someone who spells finance "FINACNE". Jesus wept.

Yeah did exactly that last weekend. Nobody asked my identity.
