It's like my "friend". We 4 were sitting at a table, chatting and he was asking for 100 euro, he was sure he will make 200 in a few days and give back the 100. If he was so sure, i have no idea why not just do it with jis own money.

Wow... i just tell it as a funny story especially to friends thatbdon't know about crypto or hate on it. Especially since in my country it would take almost 2 years to earn 10000 euro wihout spendint a cent. Can't imagine how i'd feel about it if i had almost 300 bitcoin worthbof something (if thinking at ATH) :(

I knew about bitcoin when it was like 200 dollars. Was still in school, no job, no money. I would have bought some if i just had a job or was like 2 years older.

What about reddxoin? I remember i bought 30 euro worth of it, lost it all to gambling and checked price some time later after 6 months that 30 euro would have become 10000 euro, not sure about in comparison to btc though

Oh, for some reason i thought it was one of the better known ones. I misspelled it's reddcoin or RDD. I'm pretty sure rhat 30 euro 2 years ago would still be worth about 600 euro. I got it exactly for the reason that it was almost worthless, i got about 300 000 of them for 30 euro, jusst to bet on dice games and i don't do that shit anymore. I got big gains, but greed would get me and eventually i lose everything.

Tbh everyones finish flag is different. And if you don't have a goal, i guess you don't really need bitcoin. My goal would be tobhave enough byc to quit job.

I guess end flag is lambo

I wonder if it's a bot. Because i got a message from the same user but the first few sentences were differe t from OPs, kind of personalised to me. If it's a human, then he certainly was busy. I guess when you make 17k a month by doing nothing you have a lot of free time /s
