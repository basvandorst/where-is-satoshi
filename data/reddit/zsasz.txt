Everybody has totally missed the point. The point isn't a business idea. The question was would that kind of a institution force governments to accept bitcoin as a currency.

Tether is owned by bitfinex. It all started with bfx tokens.

Bitfinex is generating tokens for every dollar put in. They have generated over 600 million tokens. People are thinking it's not backed by anything. Also there is a growing pressure from the public to allow for some kind of audit. But to date there has been none. Price bursts have been correlated with the tokens generated and bitcoin bought with them.
This is also getting me worried. I'm a long time holder and surely not going to sell for years to come but as it is said in the comments here, this kind of growth can not be sustained. I know it sounds like FUD but it all sounds a bit too good to be true.

I'm a bit out of the loop but why are people using Dorian Nakamotos picture for bitcoin related memes. Did he not specifically say that he had nothing to do with the creation of bitcoin?
