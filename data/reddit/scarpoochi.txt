I'm talking about CNBC. They shouldn't be stooping low like this. The markets, that's a different matter I would agree with you there.

Sucks, cause I was liking CNBC and Brian Kelly about 3 months ago before crypto went apeshit. Then after Roger Ver, the obvious misinformation and unprofessionalism, they basically turned into a fucking crypto Twitter account. 
Can't believe NBC heads are letting their hosts get away with this. This isn't a game and it's people real money.

Yes, there Twitter seems be taken over by a high school intern.

I talk to "smart" old finance guys all the time. Hear the same tulips, drug dealers, bubble bullshit from them everytime.

Nice man! What'd you do with the money? Do you still hold any?

There is absolutely zero evidence of that in the video.

How much would it cost to send say $100 worth of BTC to friend on the otherside of the country?
@_date: 2017-11-26 09:21:35
