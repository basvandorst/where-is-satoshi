Reminds me of the can of shaving cream from Jurassic Park.

Another trezor add; good for you guys. This is a great place to market your product I wish everyone at trezor great success. 
Why not just make an official Trezor account though? just looking at your profile its obvious you work for Trezor.

I've been living in Thailand since I was 7 years old in the boiler room of a Muay Thai gym and my body language demands so much respect that the taxi drivers actually pay ME to drive me around. You must be doing it wrong.

Why not make a Trezor account like poloniex and coinbase then? Especially if you're going to post ads for your company; which makes a decent product. But I come here to learn about the most recent bitcoin developments and if a user wants to organically post a cool pic ok; not "sick" ads from the CTO of a company.

What is the best method for getting my crypto into cold storage these days? A hardware wallet or making an electrum wallet with a seed that I memorize and hide?
I used to run core on an external hard drive but during the first BTC fork when I tried to claim my BCH I almost lost all my btc. I had to take my keys off the harddrive and redownload the whole blockchain. I got tired of having to constantly wait to update the blockchain every week. Also got paranoid about dropping or loosing my external harddrive. 
I want to start taking my BTC offline as I'm buying again so what is the new consensus on best offline storage? Nano ledger?

I have an old tamale bag that I fill with coins and turn into bitcoin every year or so when it's full. I walk into my bank and deposit it then buy btc online. I bought most my btc with my income but I've made it a point to turn all my useless change to btc for a few years now. If this pops up at my local walmart I'll use it no doubt.
