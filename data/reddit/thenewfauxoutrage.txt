According to many you should be delighted to get permission first. Ahhh be a grown up and be subservient to your masters. Keep those shackles on. Pray to your lords and ask them what they desire. Stay on the farm, be milked, ordered about, reproduce and die. Don't live to discover your purpose in life. Your rulers have done this for you. Don't live to make discoveries that may benefit others. Your rulers will do this for you.
My only hope for the world is this forum is dominated by capitulating US citizens, otherwise humanity is dead. 
Thankfully there are others besides Bitcoin.

My income not being told to government is privacy. What I purchase is privacy. I'm not waving a white flag and framing my privacy in politically correct ways.

Vote on your overloards. Then I'll assume voting is an exercise of faith.

1BtcGirgZqyT2z69DLn4y9MErN182mw8Tk appears to be doing the same.

People complain about the elites yet grant authority of all human activity to the elites. Makes me wonder why religion catches so much crap for operating similarly.

I started my holiday shopping (clothing) when Bitcoin reached 400 USD. I want to participate but I don't see much else I want to buy. If there is a list of decentralized products and ideas I'd like to donate.

The meetings with tech giants went well also. Then later, NSA revelations.

Primetime what? It's being accepted by merchants.

Wasteful. Governments will kill people for dubious reasons. Better off eliminating weaknesses in and around Bitcoin.

My end goal: Move to another country. Finance ways to make it possible or provide the best information for others wanting to move. Finance those doing (not voting) activities which allow for more freedom. Donate to Hitomi Tanaka.

What you mean no taxes? The government wants a cut whether it is a collectible, commodity, etc. Tony "Government" Soprano counts the small pay for jury duty as income so don't think it doesn't want a cut. If you are not paying taxes you are choosing not to pay.  I'm choosing not to pay. I guess what you are really asking is why is the government not forcing companies to violate my privacy.  Or why is government not forcing companies to pay government my earnings first.

My mother is still unable to pay her bills online so I do it.  While things can be made easier some people will never grasp Bitcoin. Electrum works. Armory works. Blockchain.info for carry Bitcoin works. I haven't been a victim and I have very little understanding of cryptography. But I do know how to backup, use Lastpass and Keepass, and read what smart people say on various Bitcoin forums. All that's needed is the hardware.

One reason I somewhat glad the mainstream and critics stay away. I see more good actions from Bitcoin enthusiasts than anywhere else.

That is what needs to be worked on. So many people have bought into political rhetoric they have come to believe they are safe. The reality is you are not. Yeah, governments may prosecute outsiders but not itself. Government isn't neutral, it has an agenda like everyone else. People rely too much on politics, unfortunately I don't see this changing soon.
Start thinking of solutions that require no actions from a politician. Bitcoin (cryptcoins) is a start.

What governments say and do are two different things. I ignore the rhetoric which is why I don't vote. What government/politicians say is irrelevant to me.

I recall it going up before that but I guess All Praises Be To Government to the people searching for government legitimacy.

In 2011, executives from Apple, Google, etc had a private meeting with the president. In 2013 we find out what the NSA is doing. I rather judge on past behavior than be naive and a victim.

I agree. Don't mean you shouldn't be wary of the companies.
