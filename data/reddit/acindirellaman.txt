You are right. I have no reason to list here. I don't know anything about those charges in fact. I just didn't buy charges about assange. I am sorry to write my opinions without having information. But who has actually information ? I am sensitive when it comes to these kind of multiple charges and very suspicious. Let me explain why. And decide if it makes sense or not. When someone is charged for multiple crimes an average person would say. All these can not be coincidence. So many charges. Not only one. And this makes someone definitely guilty in public opinion. So if I had enough power to discredit someone. I would do the same thing. Create multiple charges. So you don't even need to proove. He is already discredited. You got what you wanted.
If it were only about his neighbour. I would say. Could be. But since there is also rape charge additionaly that smells bad. Makes me suspicious. I know this is a strange way of reasoning but that's how my brain works. Rape charges especially for people like assange or McAfee smells bad. Because rape charges in it's nature are the ones that very hard to proof and very hard to proove that there wasn't any rape neither. But discredits a person in a matter of seconds.

Sounds like a set up similar to what they did for Julian assange. I am sorry but I never believe this shits. If you can't discredit someone rightfully. Just pay a girl to declare being raped !!! Dadaaam. Now all the world hates you even if there is no evidence. People are emotional creatures and very easy manipulated. Try using common sense. Stick to the reality. He is innocent until really proven.
