get it in writing, take a picture, timestamp it on the blockchain.

Of course.

Bought one. Regret it. Poor quality, poor print, poorly arranged when you get it up close.

"supports" should read "is open to considering the tradeoffs of"
As any rational person should be.
See this and the following tweet:

Yikes, dude seems to be fraying.  Empty article too, sounds like hes weakly trying to resolve infighting within his orgs by not saying anything of substance. Weak backpedal, weak direction...

it seems like the only difference is a touch screen. maybe this enables different use cases but functionally i think it will be mostly equivalent.  mainly interested in vulnerability differences.

The optimal play - they are certainly still trying to usurp Bitcoin and the will of the users.

I have actively delayed purchasing mining equipment so as to not support Bitmain.  This is extremely welcome.

Not impossible, just misleading.

Covenants and other on chain deterrents to theft will help this immensely.

label your axes! (and plots)

You're describing a chain of hashes/data which of course can exist but has none of the interesting properties the Bitcoin blockchain exhibits. 
This structure, as is mentioned above, has the same properties as append only databases but with inferior speed.
The one thing a "blockchain" without value token might offer is a ubiquitous structure shared among developers and projects but I find this unlikely - there are no practical benefits to drive adoption of this. Right now hype is driving this but that will die.
When people say blockchain they mean to invoke the interesting, "secured in a distributed manner" datatype, and as such its not possible to build a blockchain without a value token.
