It's almost like yoCoin only wanted to make a point and didn't listen...

Think about it this way: The US currently has a GDP of about $17 trillion. But there are only about $1 trillion dollars in circulation. That means that on average any given US dollar has to be exchanged 17 times in a year for the GDP figure to be met. (This is a very simplistic view since there are other types of money that can be used to make that GDP figure, but using current ratios between GDP and currency is useful to find out how this would all play out with another currency.)


Using my example, you would need to divide 3.5 million by 17. This is no longer in the millions. Also, it doesn't include the fact that more than just the US economy uses the USD. Other nations use it (6 officially and 17 unofficially) as well as many transactions for international trade. So that figure is probably bigger than 17.

I don't get it. How are companies going to be obsolete? Why shouldn't you buy shares of a company?

You guys know that the movie used there was about pumping and dumping, right?

You just gave $50!!!
Just kidding. I have no idea about any of that.

You need to divide that number by velocity of the monetary base. That is MB; not the velocity of M1 or M2.And then you are also assuming that every person on earth uses bitcoin and there are no competing currencies.

The green countries use the comma for the decimal mark (blue use period).

Of course lost coins are not considered into the price. That's like saying gold on Mars is counted into the market cap of gold since until its found, it's just considered dormant. In supply and demand, only what is reasonably available is considered supply. As far as I understand, lost coins are not assessable without their private key, right? Well then if that information is lost then the coins are never expected to be in use, hence not considered part of supply.

Alright, then lets say instead of Mars, it's gold on a ship at the bottom of the ocean. It's been mined and accounted for, but its not part of the market. It's lost to us so we don't use it in measurements.I would be more open to an argument that not yet minded coins should be part of the market cap. That is since their future existence has already been priced into the current price.But lost coins, no way. Losing currency puts a deflationary effect on prices. In other words, if we go by your method, then lost coins push up market cap (which it shouldn't).

Does that account for lost coins?

While I disagree with you on the validity of the official numbers, I'd rather just focus that my response was directed towards the "using governments own figures" part.And why did I get downvoted for correcting someone? Sorry for not going along with the community's narrative.Bitcoin; where the facts don't matter, and everything is made up.
