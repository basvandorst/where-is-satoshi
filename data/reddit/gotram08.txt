I found the problem! There's a transaction that appears twice on my CashApp purchase history that was really only made once which is also strange... sucks that I had to find the issue myself without support replying to my email.

Yes I know nothing about cold storage so I'm just looking for something simple to set up and put away. I have some bitcoin spread out through several apps but as the price has gone up it's time to find something I can secure myself. I'm assuming the set up for both is pretty straightforward but I see two different versions of each Nano S and Nano X as well as Trezor One and Trezor T. Since I'm just using it to store would I be fine with getting the least expensive unit?

ok so installed the trezor bridge and i'm at the my wallet dashboard it says my trezor is not backed up... but i still haven't received my seed words yet. when exactly do i see my seed words???
@_date: 2019-08-08 22:50:54
how do you set this option?
@_date: 2019-08-08 19:49:14
Would it be smart to write down my seed and leave one or two words off and just memorize them??
@_date: 2019-08-08 22:48:14
hopefully by then I'll be too rich to care=\]

is there a process a business must go through to accept bitcoin or do you just start taking it as payment and pay taxes based on the USD price?
@_date: 2019-08-08 22:47:32
isn't there a bigger chance of me losing my seed than getting in an accident and losing my memory?
@_date: 2019-08-09 00:10:04
.0001? So everything
@_date: 2019-08-09 00:08:34
Ok I figured it out. It gives you the words when you begin the back up process. I got scared for a second
@_date: 2019-08-08 22:49:15
yes but i dont want to risk it lol one or two words is enough
@_date: 2019-08-09 00:10:39
Just got done with the installation process. I'll be sending some tomorrow to test
@_date: 2019-08-08 22:52:22

@_date: 2019-08-08 22:51:49

Couldn't they technically freeze your account for "suspicious activity"?

A very small percentage of houses and cars can be purchased with bitcoin today.
@_date: 2019-04-22 18:59:11
I like this answer but what if it hits $100,000 within a year or two and there are alot of things you can't yet purchase with bitcoin like a house or car?
@_date: 2019-05-24 13:14:48
How do they know where the bitcoin came from?
@_date: 2019-05-24 13:16:40
I dont have a personal wallet. I've been looking into Trezor what do you recommend
