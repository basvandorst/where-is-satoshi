Same thing just happened with litecoin this past summer. It went up months before the halving with no other explanation why.
This is the exact same scenario, price doubles and there is no reasoning behind it other than the halving looming.
Sorry to burst your bubble (no pun intended) but this is not the beginning of the next Bitcoin surge.

3. Have a bunch of their intern monkeys go through a competition to see who can build the best Bitcoin resource/blockchain page for Google.com.

We're experiencing mass merchant adoption without the mass consumer adoption.
It's still stupidly painful for the average person to purchase any bitcoins, while it's stupidly easy for merchants to accept it.
You can be rest assured this downward pressure will only continue to get worse until consumer adoption can catch up to merchant adoption.
Until then expect these markets to just bleed to death like they have been for over a year.

@_date: 2017-05-25 00:14:56
I consider anyone with a couple $100k worth of ETH bag holders at this point. It will be next to impossible for them to get out at these prices without popping the bubble.
If you believe 92 million coins can sustain a price over $100 let alone $200 you are absolutely nuts. Remember ETH is very very heavily premined and even exploited into a hard fork.
Good luck with your pipe dream that is ETH.

@_date: 2017-05-24 23:26:42
The only reason ETH bubble hasn't popped is because there is next to zero liquidity for bag holders to dump into. One whale dumping can wipe out an entire exchange worth of orders. The only way for them to get out is very slowly having people buy into their orders slowly increasing the price like we're seeing. When it does pop, its going to be the biggest crash in crypto history.

People don't realize with the mass merchant adoption and mining companies, there is a constant downward pressure with coins constantly being sold.
The only consistency with the price is that it is going to bleed more and more each and everyday.
At this point the next big bubble you all are waiting for is mass consumer adoption which is still years away.
@_date: 2017-05-27 04:04:41
No real shock event?
How about the network reaching it's limit because the blocksize debate has been a stalemate for 2+ years? How about Chinese miners holding the decision process hostage? How about Bitpay needing to switch to a separate fork or coin because Bitcoin just isn't working for them anymore? How about Coinbase being unable to cope with the increased demand of delusional buyers?
Sorry but once again, Bitcoin is not ready for mass adoption, we are at least 1 or 2 more bubbles away from that not including this bubble that just popped.
@_date: 2017-05-26 05:57:28
This feels like the bull trap unfortunately. The first sell off bear trap already happened at $1900ish down to $1600 between may 10th and 14th.
We are now as I type this in the bull trap returning to "normal" for a day or two before the real dump begins.
It won't be so bad though, it should have no problem bottoming out around $1200 and then sustaining a $1200-$1500 range until the next bubble.
I hope I'm wrong, but I've witnessed too many of these now to be delusional enough to think this is just a bump in the road on the way to $5000+.
Sorry to say, but Bitcoin is not ready for that kind of mass adoption, it's already being pushed to the limits. Maybe if the blocksize debate hadn't been dragged on for 3 years and counting this bubble could sustain 5x ATH growth like the previous bubbles. However, that apparently was not meant to be.
Many will disagree with me and that is fine, but just know that I am a long time supporter of both Bitcoin and Litecoin and wish it just as much success as all of you. Sometimes you need to be realistic and know when things are just too good to be true, right now that's how I feel.

Whether you're right or wrong is irrelevant at this point, the bubble has popped. Any new money coming in won't be buying into this mess until the dust settles.

"Keep your internet money away from the internet"
That is a great pro tip for new people looking to get into Bitcoin and bodes well for the future.

This isn't panic yet, just wait for the real blood.

You can't trust an exchange to hold your fiat for a month?

What cellphone do you have? Search for "xyz phone sucks"
What car do you drive? Search for "xyz car sucks"
Seriously, stop letting a few bad words make decisions for you.

Timber!!! Faster than it rises it falls, these markets are still such a joke.

Taking the money and running from the law is one thing, but running from the potential criminals with large sums of money lost is a whole nother ball of wax. I'd be terrified every second of my life with this kind of run.

Great, now over 100,000 merchants pushing the price down because they all convert their coins to cash.

How do you list eth, xrp and dash and exclude ltc?

There was another economic crash coming back in the beginning of 2014.
There was also supposed to be an economic crash in 2013.
Now there is supposed to be an economic crash in 2015?
Give me a fucking break with this shit already.

I predict that if these coins ever return to their original owners, it will be the start of the next bubble popping with most of them finally cashing out.

Why don't you ask everyone how much they're net worth is while you're at it.
@_date: 2015-03-26 22:44:34
Yay more good news!
Now grab your popcorn as we watch the price drop, again.
@_date: 2017-05-27 04:06:22
Trying to convince people to hold or buy into the falling knife that just popped this bubble is the real FUD imo.

There is too much legal money in there for it to just be seized and auctioned.
A run may be a possibility but the runners might want to consider who they may be running from.
The most likely scenario is either;
1) They come back requiring full kyc/aml to continue trading/withdraw/deposit
2) They come back to only allow withdrawals requiring kyc/aml
3) Same goes for  if assets are seized. It would actually work as a great honey pot.

If you can't even figure out how to buy Bitcoin at this point in time with all the resources available, then you probably shouldn't be buying.
@_date: 2017-06-29 00:42:58
This would work with Litecoin, definitely not Bitcoin.

"Later, we will support the activation of SegWit on the UAHF chain if there is no patent risk associated with SegWit and if the arbitrary discount rate of witness data segment is removed."
There you have it folks, this is all about Jihan trying to protect asic boost and higher fees.

You could have made this very same curve for the first run up to $1200 back in 2013 and say the price would never drop below $600. We all know how that turned out...

If their hash power is profitable, why would they undercut themselves to give you a cut?
@_date: 2017-07-29 05:37:37
They would still be used but take a massive hit for sure. If they came back with no coins or money lost for customers, wouldn't that pass the ultimate resiliency test?
@_date: 2016-05-12 04:57:33
Please don't hire someone to do this for you...

One thing is for sure, $3000 will not be broken again before Aug 1st. Question is where is the bottom. Maybe there is no bottom until the scaling solution is found.
@_date: 2017-06-14 06:21:34
Sold all my ETH at $400, now 100% back in litecoin. I only played ETH for the hype/hysteria phase and it worked out perfectly. I won't be touching it again no matter what happens, there is far too much uncertainty starting to cloud around it and I've lived through that more than once in this industry to know how it plays out.
Now give me that sweet lightning LTC :)

This is still bad news...
Being treated as a commodity instead of a currency means companies like Baidu, Telecom and more won't bother bringing back their acceptance of it.

Yes except for the fact the recent crashes were from China news, not because a whale was dumping...
@_date: 2013-12-17 23:31:02
Has anyone considered the potential positive from all this? China banned 3rd party exchanges because when someone buys bitcoins through them it's anonymous. Now that the middle man has been cut out, it's straight bank to bitcoin exchange transfers. Perhaps they see how fast their citizens are adopting bitcoin and are willing to let it fly, but not before laying the proper ground work so it doesn't get out of control...
I wouldn't be surprised to see a bitcoin PBOC exchange come out of no where taking the place of Tenpay and the other 3rd parties now cut off. The banks want a piece, maybe this is the piece they're after.

I've added bitpay as an option of payment for a forex related product which sells about 2-5 copies a day. In 4 months I haven't made a single bitpay sale... I'm not going to drop it, but kind of pathetic especially being in such a closely related niche.
