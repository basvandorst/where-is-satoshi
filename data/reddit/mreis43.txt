Security though obscurity is not security

The one only a dozen people can crack is the safer option. Only a dozen people can crack it, that is the most amount of people that can get in.
For the hidden safe with a dozen people, there are 12 people who can get in off the bat, but there is also the possibility of others stumbling upon the location. Techniques can be used to try to find the safe. For the safe example, let's say a metal detector, for encryption, Caeser's cypher can easily be broken by analysing patterns in the letters.
So, 12 at most vs at least 12. The secure known method always trumps the insecure unknown method

There is a big difference. With encryption, it is known that there is a secret, and the decryption algorithm is generally known. It's like having a safe in a known location out in the open, but no way to get in without the key. 
If instead data is encrypted by some simple mechanism, say a Caeser cypher, but we don't publicise what the method was, hoping that no one will be able to guess the method, that is the "through obscurity" I'm referring to. It's like having a safe that anyone can open, let's just hope no one finds it.
Which is pretty much the case above ;)

Your bitcoins are publicly available to anyone who has the key. This is the concept I'm trying to illustrate. But your key is safe, so is your bitcoin. The wallet can be known, all encryption algorithms used are public and known. If the key is safe, no need to hide anything else. Of course you can hide the safe, security isn't any worse by doing so, but you can't just rely on it being hidden and then not putting a lock on it...
If you follow the comment thread, one dude mentions this safe in the wall isn't safe, because it can be accessed by simply breaking the drywall. Another dude says, you have to know that it's there in the first place. Which is true, but does not mean it's safe.

But it rhymes!
Of course what is normally meant by the term is relying on the fact that the method or location is unknown and if it becomes known the item is no longer secure. Which given the drywall argument, seems to be the case here.
