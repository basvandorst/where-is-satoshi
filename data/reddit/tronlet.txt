Credibility on the subject of bitcoin has a hell of a lot to do with whether or not you know how to set up a wallet for bitcoin or any of its derivatives.
Either he's full of it and fishing for tips, which loses him credibility, or he's completely clueless about actually using bitcoin in practice, which obviously loses him credibility.
Plus, if you think Bitcoin is unsound, where's the logic behind supporting a **very** mechanically similar derivative?

You realize not everyone who supports bitcoin is into your anarchist ideology, right? Mods are an important part of any online community with a couple rare examples, such as 4chan where the almost complete lack of modding outside of legally mandatory moderation gives it its... "charm".
Not to mention there's already one mod, and one mod is worse as far as "too much power" goes than two mods, or three mods.

Of course it fell below the price of mining, that's what always happens when the price drops. Opposite happens when the price goes up. No matter which direction bitcoin prices go in it's a constant balance between the difficulty and the price, if the price goes down miners will give up and make the difficulty drop until it's fair again, if the price goes up, miners will turn on their machines again and try to get in on it, thus raising the difficulty and balancing it out again.

Except that's not what happened. Had no clue that happens otherwise I would've specified.
I'm willing to show I have the private keys if it'll get me the bitcoin I'm missing.
The address does have some funky activity in bc.info's history, but this is because I did some experimenting previously.
I suppose it is possible that someone gained the private key to this specific address somehow, though I don't know how, or why they wouldn't have gained access to other, non-drained addresses. Seems most likely, or MtGox flagged it for the odd transactions beforehand. Maybe I had the privkey in view on my screen with a RAT running that took a screenshot, or maybe I mixed something up that I'm forgetting and this address has a shared private key. The latter I'm almost positive isn't correct, but maybe I was up all night and forgot something at some point and mixed this up with the aforementioned address I experimented with. One must never rule out one's own error.

Earth would be the only place miners could mine, every block any miners with a communication distance too large could mine would almost certainly be outdated before it reached all the miners on Earth. As for people doing transactions, everything would stay the same, just slower.

I doubt this is what teknic111 means, but one scenario could be that if a computer comes about with unprecedented hashing ability, it could mine every remaining coin before the difficulty could be readjusted to compensate, since difficulty is only readjusted every 2 weeks.
In practice, no matter how powerful computers get, the difficulty will raise to continue to make it just as difficult to mine bitcoins as it was before, but in theory, if an incredible computer came out of nowhere and managed to mine almost every remaining bitcoin before the difficulty was raised (massively) to slow it, then there would be nothing to be done.
@_date: 2013-05-06 02:43:27


Missing the point entirely.
Bitcoin is a concept, a currency. There are bitcoin clients that you can download. They will give you addresses, and if bitcoins are sent from other clients to these addresses, then bitcoins will show up in your client. You can then send these bitcoins to other addresses, if you so choose.
That's literally all the basic user needs to know. It is a currency, nothing more. If you understand how the US dollar is used you can understand that, even more so if you understand how to use PayPal.
What makes it special is that it's controlled by no one, and it's completely open to scrutiny. The transaction fees are also very small compared to virtually any other method of transaction other than cash, which can only be transferred in real life of course, unlike bitcoin. Credit cards have fees that can actually cripple small businesses due to how high they are, it's just that you don't notice these fees because typically the business will just raise prices rather than explicitly show the fee. Bitcoin would do away with that, and indeed there is at least [one store]( which often has cheaper prices than Amazon if you pay with bitcoins, due to the money they save on transaction fees.
Anyone who downloads the "hardcore" full version of the client and blockchain (which is somewhat large, so only serious users have to do this) will be playing a role in what would normally be done by a central bank or other entity, storing transaction logs and making sure everything is legitimate.
Miners are people that are given bitcoin made out of nowhere as rewards, this is done through clever mathematical exercises and is, again, controlled by literally no one, other than anyone connected to the bitcoin network, who makes sure the miners are playing fair. They are being rewarded for performing special computational tasks which take up a lot of energy through their nature, and run up costs on the power bill. These computational tasks ensure the bitcoin network's security. Anyone who wants to can mine, but you'll probably find the costs on your power bill make it not worth it to mine, it takes some planning, thought, and typically an initial investment in hardware to actually make money off of mining nowadays.
Eventually, the mining rewards will run out, and the transaction fees I mentioned before will take the place of the mining rewards.
And that's about it. If you want to make money off of it, you've got a lot of work and planning to do, but if you want to use what could be the future of currency, the closest equivalent to cash on the internet, then this is what you're looking for.

But what's the connection? A checksum would presumably be a number of base-58 characters placed in the address in some place, right? The number of possible checksums, and thus the probability of 1/number of possible checksums, would then be 58^(number of characters).

That appears to be what they've done here, unless they ran a simulation of the Bitcoin network under assumed behavior and got the numbers that way, but that would make no sense at all.

To expand on tartare4562's answer, finding these hashes is the entire point.

The Winklevoss twins bought in at single digits sometime in 2012, they're still very much in the green, and they said pretty clearly that they're in it for the long term. They're not stupid, they know that if they were to sell their amount they'd harm bitcoin greatly, so they're not going to be doing that in the interest of preserving it over the long run, just because theoretically, if they could sell it all without screwing it all over, they would make more money since the price will keep going down for a little while, and then they could buy even more.

Er, no. Good job repeating one of the most common misconceptions that bitcoin newbies have as if it were some kind of fact, really helps your case!
Security, and the ability to trust that it is a valuable way to perform transactions. This is what backs Bitcoin. The difficulty that it takes to create, or more accurately claim a bitcoin is nothing more than a method to distribute them reasonably.
Similarly, this is what backs the US dollar. They're really not all that different in that regard, even though the way the US dollar's security is ensured is through government and physical copy-protection measures, whereas Bitcoin is kept secure through mathematics and the size of the overall mining network.

Not too much. Here, colored coins would be destroyed by being included in a transaction to the miner address.
There was already a very easy way for colored coins to be destroyed by the careless user, this is just a way that is just as easy. Any colored coins sent to an address with *any* coins of a different color, or with no color at all, would be immediately gone. That's quite similar in ease and destruction.
Come to think of it, it might be possible to "restore" the colored coins by sending the precise amount to the original coin coloring address (which would then be sent to the secondary coin coloring address, this is something to make it possible to redeem random transactions towards either of these public addresses with only coins involved from one address towards the other being colored), from the address the colored coins disappeared into.

Demystify? There is nothing to demystify, they clearly understand the situation, and unlike many companies that reply with canned answers, they have a well thought out reason as to why they do not wish to use it.
The only thing you can ask to do is have the massive legal gray area surrounding Bitcoin cleared up, and I think you want to ask legislators about that, not the Reddit Bitcoin community.
I say this as a passionate Bitcoin supporter.

Most recently, bought a 4chan pass, because I'm sure that crazy site's earned my money for something at some point, and it's annoying to have to disable my VPN to make a 4chan post on the rare occasion I feel inclined to.
Second most recently, I buy a lot of comments reddit gold to support reddit's bitcoin choice.
Third, the Humble Serious Sam Weekly Bundle.
The most recent time it was significantly advantageous over normal methods (more so than it is already), was when I was ordering a large amount of things I needed as soon as possible over Amazon.
Hit my obnoxious credit limit, bought an Amazon gift card with Gyft and topped off the funds needed. Thanks, bitcoin!

Borrowing to pay off borrowed money? That does not really solve any problem, does it?
@_date: 2013-03-22 01:01:59
Last we heard from reddit was losing money by accepting bitcoin for reddit gold, due to the extra money required to manage it. 
They were sticking with it in the hopes it would turn around, but it's a bit much to expect them to potentially lose money on ads too, right now. Maybe later.

I'm assuming you know about the blockchain/ledger concept, and blocks.
The ledger, aka blockchain, before the fork:
After the fork, two versions of the ledger:
56,67,29,60,42,81,60,**106**,58,24  
Note that those were fake, example, imitations of ledgers and barely look anything like an actual ledger. Each two-digit number represents a block, and the number is how many transactions that block in the ledger accounts for.
This happened because one of the latest "numbers", i.e. blocks, was larger than expected, because Bitcoin is getting more popular, and so the block had to store more transactions. So large, in fact, that the 0.7 Bitcoin client could not handle it. In my mockup, it became a 3-digit number, something over 99.
However, the 0.8 Bitcoin client could handle it.
So, basically, the 0.8 client's version has this oversized block, which automatically forks it off from the 0.7 client's version of the blockchain, since they contradict. The reason this forking happens is so that if someone maliciously changes the blockchain for their own purposes, everyone will see that it does not match the real blockchain, and they will fork off and be left with a useless ledger.
That's the basic gist of it. It's not *that* bad, though. Both 0.8 and 0.7 can handle the 0.7 version, of course, since that only has "two-digit" blocks. The plan is, basically to alert the major mining pools that 0.8 mining can't be allowed, so the 0.8 blockchain will be slower than the 0.7 blockchain. Whichever blockchain is the longest is the one accepted automatically by all legitimate Bitcoin clients.
That's more or less it, though it's not entirely accurate.

Oh yes, I know. What I mean by noticeable amount of coin is, say, a dollar's worth per week and higher. Just something where there's actually any amount that's worth sending over from the pool to your wallet, even if it's negligible.

It's pretty damn easy, to be honest. If someone wants to get into a computer you use regularly, assuming you don't have very paranoid habits, they'll be able to if they try hard enough. Keyloggers, RATs, antivirus obfuscation, and a little social engineering go a long way.
In fact, scratch the social engineering, you don't need to convince someone to run your .exe if you can just run your .exe for them via a Java drive-by attack, and admit it, you've left Java installed for extended periods of time, even if you try to keep it uninstalled normally. I know I've found this one thing that I just have to download and install Java for, then totally forget or put off uninstalling it afterwards, many a time.
The easiest way to have real security, I assume, would be to only ever access your wallet via smartphone, and possibly only closed platforms like the iPhone though I don't know enough about exactly how Android works to know if it could be susceptible in the way PCs are.
In the end, you just have to smile and take it, like the risk of getting mugged when you're walking down the street.
@_date: 2013-05-13 07:17:42
Yep, not JavaScript. JavaScript has its own problems, but it's not quite as dangerous as Java and it's also much more needed for regular browsing so I tend to leave it installed. If you want to be *super* safe though, JavaScript is not your friend. The TOR browser bundle has it disabled by default.

In case people don't understand why, it's rounded to the nearest nickel if you're not paying with pennies, so the price will always end with a 0 or a 5. So, if the price ends in 0, 1, 2, 5, 6, or 7, it's just going to be rounded down or not rounded at all, and you'll get it cheaper. If it ends in 3, 4, 8, or 9 it'll be rounded up to the nearest nickel, so you'll save one or two pennies if you bother to insist on paying in pennies instead.

Sorry to threadjack, but this is important.
**It is only a default. You can change it. It will only be in bitcoin-qt.**
It is, or will be, hardcoded into bitcoin-qt, but not bitcoin overall. Bitcoin-qt is, of course, open source, and so you could "unhardcode" this, and I'm sure someone will and distribute this altered version, so you won't need any coding ability at all to use a different bitcoin-qt.
I very much oppose this as an immutable law and audibly gasped when I saw this title, but definitely support it as an avoidable rule. Dust txs are a problem.
It is true that dust transactions will most likely become even slower, but Deepbit will likely continue to mine any and all transactions, as they do now. They are, afaik, the biggest reason free transactions are as fast as they are. In addition, with the new restriction, dust transactions would most likely decrease enough that Deepbit would not feel too much pressure to suddenly change this.
Besides, 54 uBTCs is about half a US penny right now, anyone who sends that much or less is doing it for the novelty value. Since this isn't a modification to the bitcoin protocol itself, it can be altered as needed.
Edit: Heh, and after typing all this out I see that's basically what the parent comment said. I saw this post and already knew what was actually going on, so I only glanced at the comment. I'll leave this up anyway, in case others skip past the longer comment but notice my bold text.

We can't comprehend a number that size with our actual brains, up close. Hell, we even have trouble with a number like 1000000. We can perform all sorts of calculations with numbers, of course, but typically only when we abstractualize them into "1000000", or "one trillion", or "28400000000000000000000".
What I meant was that the human brain cannot actually comprehend of a real world example, and indeed we find it hard to comprehend of a real world example of one million, or even numbers smaller still. Can you think of what a hundred thousand of something would look like, would be like, would mean in real life?
So, of course it's incomprehensibly large. You could say that one million is too, but a number that big takes it to a whole other level.
As for the rest of your points, that's fair to say.

That's pretty interesting, yeah, I had forgotten about LTC and figured it wouldn't go anywhere.
LTC is still so incredibly niche, though, its only adopters are Bitcoin users and it has an adoption rate by Bitcoin users similar to Bitcoin adoption by dollar users. With such a small market right now, maybe people are just deciding to buy them because they just want to, and are in it for the long haul, i.e., the price would stay relatively the same after this jump.
Doubtful though, it'll probably go down after this, but who knows, maybe that'll just be like the Bitcoin bubble in 2011.
I'm definitely no expert, but yeah, I'd recommend holding off, I doubt it'll be soaring too much higher. If it crashes then you may as well buy some and see what happens.

Assuming those are real numbers, there are a few things to consider. It could be only nodes that have things configured correctly to have more than 8 connections to the bitcoin network, and actually connect properly. (Yep, it's not supposed to max out at 8!)
Also, it's very likely excluding things like Electrum, where you don't have to download the whole blockchain and seed it.

When they were 30 dollars, you could have bought 10 bitcoins at a time for 300 dollars each. But you didn't want that, you wanted to buy them for 30 dollars a piece.
If bitcoins are worth 300 dollars at some point, people can still buy .1 of a bitcoin for 30 dollars a piece, and they'll get the exact same immediate value as you did when you bought them for 30 dollars a piece.
Indeed, if bitcoins are ever worth millions, people will still be able to buy .000001 of a bitcoin, which they can do now but it is rather pointless. The tiniest division possible right now is .00000001 of a bitcoin, but this can easily be changed in a theoretical world where each bitcoin would be worth millions.
