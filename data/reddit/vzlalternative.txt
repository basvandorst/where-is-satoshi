the system says I already have a referral code. lol would you place something else that wasn't there?
@_date: 2019-08-30 18:32:28










thanks yes bro, im checking the website.   its this really?
@_date: 2019-08-30 17:22:24


yes. I published two years ago when I found out about this, but because I had a new child with my wife, I disconnected from these things because I didn't find answers. I lost my access data, and just a few days ago I tried to log in again, enter and publish on these topics. However, for not publishing on issues about Venezuela, does it cause you distrust? that makes no sense. I don't understand this platform very well. but have. Ask what you want from Venezuela. I have no problems with answering. I think there is no more evidence than that. . I am also not asking for money. I am asking for information. Do you consider that reason that causes you distrust? Are you going to lose information that can help someone else?
I am not fighting by the way.

disculpa otra duda. como hago para que los mensajes en el reddit me salgan en orden. es que no entiendo por que tu mensaje salio casi en toda la mitad de los comentarios :S
@_date: 2019-08-30 18:31:18
lol.. no offense. But it seems a bit silly. to deduce something based on how I write English or not. If you read the comments. You will realize that I was writing first from my mobile phone. Because I had no electricity. and then I responded from the google translator when electricity came back to my house.

Jajajaja, If you earn a million dollars today. What would you do with that money. as a politician? incredible that you say so many things and cannot answer such simple questions ... communism is an absolute void. For that reason you don't have answers to such simple questions.

If it solves many things. because the bolivar is devalued every minute that passes. The bolivar has been devalued in 3 days from 17500 to the 25000 bolivares found today. Therefore, having bolivares is not a reliable solution for me and my family. while bitcoin is.

I didn't understand your message much. but I will respond with respect to what I understand.
1) The United States is not to blame for what happens in Venezuela.
2) what happens in Venezuela is the fault of a government disguised as a socialist who ended up being a communist.
3) Never vote for this government.
4) The economic situation that arouses in my country is due to the bad economic policies that these people manage within the country.
 4.a) If you own a company you must invest in your company to continue selling. something that this government does not do.
4.b) there is no internal investment within the country. whereby the production ends.
5) The use of drug trafficking, drugs, prostitution, terrorism, is influenced by terrorist groups such as the Farc, Hezzbolah and others. This government is in favor of this kind of thing. Therefore I consider them a terrorist government.
6) I could continue to answer many more things, but I think that with this I clarify your doubts.
@_date: 2019-08-30 16:37:20
To answer you correctly, use the google translator. Because I clearly understand that sometimes because of the bad English we have, we can give answers that cause inconsistencies. That's why I prefer to use the translator in this type of topics. Also before when I answered I was copying from the phone.
If you do a little research about why I mention Hezbollah. It is because here in my country there is a lot of influence in high political positions. as for example tarek william saab, or tarek aisami both are from Lebanon. and even many of the people linked to the groups had military training with people from those countries. Therefore, the influence and presence of these people in the country is obvious. nevertheless chavez has brought tragedy, destruction, and chaos to my country. Therefore I do not defend it. I will never defend it. It is the worst thing that happened to Venezuela. There is no single company created by Chavismo that has ever worked. or benefited my country. How are you so sure that the United States really did such a thing? Do you work in an agency where the information you say makes you say it? Do you know that there is yellowness in the news ?. What I am telling you above I say with a lot of base.

@_date: 2019-08-30 17:12:31


They (the government from venezuela, chavez, cabello and friends)  have great responsibility. I do not say the opposite of finding foreign influences throughout America. but nevertheless fully support an ideology that ended up with a country by itself. It is totally and absolutely absurd.
@_date: 2019-08-30 16:55:01
no obstante, no tengo por que juzgarte. tendras tu propia opinion de por que dices tales cosas.  pero no respondiste mis preguntas. no puedes hechar la culpa a otro gobierno del fracaso de el gobierno en otro pais. esta dictadura comunista acabo con lo poco que habia en venezuela. pero este es un pais que se levantara rapidamente una vez salga este gobiernod el poder, y deje de un lado el idealismo comunista.  pero lo que si te aconsejo es que no estes diciendo cosas que no conoces por ti mismo si son reales. por que si no trabajas en alguna entidad que te permita conocer de primera mano que si es cierto lo que estas diciendo. entonces no difames cosas que no son ciertas.  las cosas que yo estoy comentando, es por que las he vivido y las he conocido de primera mano, por lo cual tengo como decirlo

jajajajaja. how foolish you are the communists. Please answer the questions I asked you. Don't change the subject Why do you change the subject, trying to distract attention from other things. When you answer the questions I asked you. I will answer what you are doing to me. but ONLY ONE FOOL ANSWERS AN ANSWER WITH ANOTHER QUESTION. Do not change the subject and answer what I asked. I'm not propagating anyone by the way. What you are doing. I would like to see your bank accounts and bitcoin wallets. How much do you get paid seriously?

@_date: 2019-08-30 15:58:02


I know you say it with sarcasm. The suffering we live in Venezuela is not a joke to put it into play. but nevertheless I will tell you. that in the hands of the communists or because they nationalize bitcoin, poverty will not end. The wealth of a country is not its economic resources but its people. whereby. If they continue killing the people of my country, killing them psychologically and physically, we will continue to be poor.
@_date: 2019-08-30 16:45:36


cuanto te paga el gobierno por estar diciendo tonterias en internet?. acaso no tienes familia en venezuela que este pasando necesidad o muriendo de hambre?. deja de estar difamando cosas que no son reales. ambos sabemos que el pais esta jodido por culpa de el chavismo y todo lo que le rodea. no vengas a defender ideas comunistas estupidas por un poco de dinero. sabemos que los chavistas estan en internet tratando de crear buena reputacion de un sistema nefasto. pero no es asi. por que habemos personas afectadas por estas tonterias que ustedes llaman revolucion. por que no respondes a las preguntas que te hice. dime una sola empresa que halla creado el chavismo y que funcione. ademas de que realmente beneficie al pais. no existe ninguna. e incluso son tan incompetentes que han quebrado grandes empresas que sustentaban el pais.

The theory of ignoring and continuing the idea is an ancient communist technique. It can be adapted by any individual, to extend the content of an idea regardless of answers. That's why you ignore questions. to want to try to make the consequent ignorant and the next important one feel. However, your communist idea does not work with me. because you don't have a base to defend your ideals. You're just a talk saying how much profanity comes out of your mouth. The conversation can continue when you answer the questions I asked you. you simply have no answers, because there are emptiness of ideals and knowledge ...
"Dissemination or dissemination of information, ideas or opinions of a political, religious, commercial nature, etc., with the intention that someone acts in a certain way, thinks according to ideas or acquires a certain product."
Who is doing propaganda. I don't know, I wonder ?.

your heart, connects to your brain, also pumps blood to it, generates and emits ideas, and returns messages. if you stop this operation or interfere, the brain dies. just as the human body works. In a country, the communist is the one who interferes and kills a country. ;) that is suicide;)
