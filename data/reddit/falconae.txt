I'm new to bitcoins, and this is how I look at it. I've never been fond of the investment aspect of any currency but the technical details and process of mining intrigue me too much. So from my perspective, I'll keep on mining...and market swings really don't bother me.

I am an IT consultant and have been considering accepting bitcoins. This early on though, the majority of individuals that have the currency to spend are of the caliber that they do not NEED an IT consultant.
I can however see a future need as bitcoin takes more of a hold in the residential sector, thoughts?

You missed a line in 9.11.2 "except as specifically permitted or required by the Standards." which I once again refer to page 69

I was typing
*made me chuckle though
@_date: 2013-04-24 22:31:19
Sites like blockchain wont allow it

My first thought, "wow, if I sit in a pool with my friends bitcoins will just fall from the sky?"
@_date: 2013-04-22 20:19:35
That aspect isn't what I'm concerned with, it's that the people who use them now are already knowledgeable of IT related items and would not be using my services. So what's the point?

I have 1/125th of one because of, well you know....nvidia

So if someone steals your card goes out and uses it. I guess it's the merchants fault too?
@_date: 2013-04-22 21:07:03
Have not, but it is a good example. thanks!
@_date: 2013-04-24 22:38:32
Thanks I will give that a shot
*This appears to be the only real viable option, while you can transfer without a fee many have minimum transfer limits.

it already works in firefox

Primarily break-fix(virus/malware removal), residential and commercial.
RMM,upgrade assistance and new equipment procurement  for commercial.
@_date: 2013-05-25 06:37:28
Wait... You were upset a store wanted to make sure you were really the owner of the card?? 
@_date: 2013-04-24 23:20:23
No worries, here's what I get each time I [try](
@_date: 2013-04-28 02:25:42
That would SOOOO suck if you really had that much

I do computer repair, if someone pays with cash or check at time of service they get a 10% discount.

Well because I am a merchant, and I have read the document...maybe you should actually read it yourself.
top of page 69, 
"For unique transactions processed in a face-to-face environment (with the exception of truck stop transactions and card-read transactions where a non-signature CVM is used), request personal identification of the
cardholder in the form of an unexpired, official government document.
Compare the signature on the personal identification with the signature on the card. "

No merchant ever has been fined for refusing service because a customer refused to show Id. When a merchant signs up with a credit card processor they are under contract to verify the user is the actual owner of the card.  Your story is bs. 
@_date: 2013-04-22 20:21:54
Do you utilize any of the "pay with bitcoin" graphics? or are you just signed up with a processor and leave it at that.
(I also agree, residential is MUCH easier to work with....and they are used to paying for the visit at the time of the visit....non of this 15-30 net crap)

this aspect I am still having issues with, I used armory to import my keys, but when I try to send to 1 address to consolodate them (even when I set the fee to 0) it says that there is a minimum transaction of .001 that fee makes it moot to move anything under that amount.
@_date: 2013-04-26 05:19:25
I have found my answer (The ones I am trying to transfer are composed of many micro transactions...from the free btc sites so they will be subject to a mandatory fee as of version 0.5.3) 
So my only real options as I see it, buy some btc or mine for 2 years (I'm all nvidia) make a transfer and the fee will void out my micro wallets.
So how does this help in the acceptance and use of bitcoin? If I was just an average person off the street that would be endgame.  
@_date: 2013-04-24 23:04:45
actually I read, each time i've tried that I get a timeout error
