That's more than fine for me.
I have a coin base account. Is it easy to get a pro accound?

Anything short of burning the cash would have been better than spending $11k on a car to replace an 02 Camry with only 60K miles on it. Unless that thing is rusted to heck and back, was driven like a race car it's whole life, and never had oil changes... that thing should make it to 200K + miles without a problem.

I heard the same thing when I made my initial buy a while back... when BTC was just under 11K per coin. Tanked ever since. Not scared, still holding... but just saying back then everyone was all "THIS IS YOUR LAST CHANCE TO BUY UNDER 10K!!! Get your FULL BTC WHILE YOU CAN!!!"

I bought at 10.5K.... sooo

Depends on your point of view.  
People look at my 2008 RAM 1500 truck and think wow that baby seen better days.  
I look at it and think, "I'm average a monthly cost of ownership less than $100 a month". My bank account would be smiling ear to ear if it had a mouth (and ears).  
A vehicle is a tool for me. I value retiring 10 or 15 years early more than what someone thinks of my vehicle when they see it. If it does what I need, and is reasonable to keep operating, I do so. I don't "enjoy" owning a nice new truck. I enjoy seeing my retirement plans come full circle.

I have a 2010 Jeep Grand Cherokee that I'm just not overly pleased with.... prior to that my wife had a 1999 Jeep Grand Cherokee 4.0 that was just a tank. Took a lickin and kept on tickin.   
This new Jeep... with the Mercedes W5A580 (NAG-1) transmission and the 3.7 L engine. I just don't like any of it. So underwhelming in terms of power. Gas hungry. Transmission just seems so weak, constantly holding off on shifting longer than you think it should. I got it at 52,000 miles.. it's at 118,000 miles and it's had full synthetic oil changed every 5,000 miles since we got it. At 100k miles we drained the transmission fluid.  
I just don't trust this vehcile will last another 50-80K. I want to get rid of it soon. The 3.6 platform that came out just after was regarded as a much better engine.

The average person in the US lives well into their 50's or 60's.
I'm not saying to totally forget the present and live for the future... because your right. I could be in line to retire at 55, with a big fat checking account / retirement account, everythings great and then at 53 I fall over dead of a heart attack or at 47 I get hit by a bus, or at 38 I get cancer. It happens.
BUT.... prepare "reasonably". Don't say I could die one day, so I'll just go buy that brand new truck that I can't afford, and then wind up majorly dialing down my 401k savings / other savings or quitting them all together just to make ends meet. On the other hand, no sense in driving the biggest cheapest pile of crap if your in a decent spot in life.. enjoy things now and then.
You said it right out of the gate.... it's a fine balance that's necessary.

You know what will happen.   
This underlying point of this post is more of a "Do we really think this IS GOING to happen"? We all know what happens IF every millionaire out there wants her or his bitcoin.

It's pretty laughable that you think it's entirely impossible for bitcoin to exist in some state where it doesn't crash or moon.  
Currency in the united states of america, the united states dollar, might as well be called "fun coupons". The government can bring more into existence at any single time they deem necessary, there by reducing the value of every single existing dollar. It's a lie. But it's a lie that a LOT of people are VERY invested into. There are parts of this world that do not even have broadband internet access. Entire generations barely still able to master a smart phone, let alone get into digital investing.  
The fact is, bitcoin COULD BE a realistic store of value. It's "somewhat" private, and not susceptible to inflation.   
I do not envision a world where the only currency is BTC. I also do not envision things proceeding as they have been in which we all continue to have faith in our "fun coupons". It will get to the point where other countries will decide they no longer accept the USD, and do not care to express the united states debt in USD any more. Would you loan money to a friend who issued you "play money" in return? Maybe, if that friend had other resources you wanted and you could exchange the "play money" for... but each time the friend creates more play money, the play money's value changes. Soon, your just going to stop doing business with that friend.  
If whales were basically plotting to dump on the bag holders, they would have done it by now, IMO. If enough people have faith in BTC long term... there are no bag holders. In the digital age of information, we've seen a lot of countries have their currency become basically worthless or barely worth the materials used to represent said currency. The United States is heading down that road. There has got to be a reasonable replacement.

If we all really believe in the notion that BTC will shoot up in value, he only has to invest a very small portion of his position if you think about it.  
Based upon this alone, there is no reason to dump 50% of your net work into BTC. It's not even necessary to dump more than 2-3% (given you have an excessive net work) as that will put you into own at least a few dozen BTC. Extending yourself to holding anything beyond that doesn't make sense in terms of "risk to reward".  
Kevin O Leary buys 100 BTC and never misses a dime of that money. It moons and he is still super rich even if his fiat holdings tank majorly. Or it dies completely and it's barely a blip on his radar. Why invest beyond that.

Most self made millionaires are quite fond of their money. They lived a very finanically responsible life, worked a ton, saved like crazy and invested smartly.   
How many of them do you think are going to just willy nilly throw the whole shebang at bitcoin? It goes against the principals that allowed most self made millionaires to get to where they are now.

Like someone worth around half a billion doesn't already have plenty of ways of avoiding / minimizing taxes they have to pay....
@_date: 2019-08-21 02:26:01
But can BTC and it's block chain even be regulated? Doesn't seem to me that any outside entity can "regulate" it. Isn't that sort of the point?

I bought Aug 20th 0.85 BTC at a value of 1BTC approx equal to just a shade under $12,000.... sooo I got pretty recked so far lol.   
Same purchase today would net me close to 1.25 BTC  
You know how they say that there are only "X" number of limited times that buyers are down on their money historically in terms of bitcoin? I fell smack dab into one of those times lol. I'm down well over 30% in just a few months.  
  
But I look at it as something that will go up significantly in value over the next 10 or 20 years. I just could have had a much better position if I hadn't bought when everyone was screaming "THIS IS YOUR LAST CHANCE TO OWN AN ENTIRE COIN! MOONLAMBO BOYS!!!!"
