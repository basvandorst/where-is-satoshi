Don’t invite your friends while we (your parents) are on a vacation as it will undermine our power.

I think you might want to check some facts on what things happen with real/fiat money exchanges?

I'll be waiting with a bottle of wine tonight refreshing my screen every 10 seconds. 
What a great Sinterklaas gift.

Thanks! Didn't already made an MEW and Electrum wallet last week but didn't transfer my eth and btc yet because I liked having them both in one wallet (blockchain). But the fact I don't have my own key kinda scared me, but this gave the last push.

My complaint is mostly about the way Roger operates. 
Fundamentally, the changes they implemented on bch make it faster and cheaper, but less safe. Correct me if I’m wrong but I thought it was because of the bigger blocksize of bch makes it less easy for small miners to mine and therefore more centralized. More centralized = less safe.

Raoul Paul actually got a youtube channel called real vision finance and posts a lot of great contents of interviews with high level individuals about the macro economy and the importance of bitcoin, and precious metals. So he’s probably doing more for bitcoin than most of us ever will.

Are people actually panicking?

Here’s an upvote for you sir

Would you mind taking a picture of your balls hanging in front of the chart so I can set my buy order at the right price?

The “free 0.2 btc crypto casino” are very annoying these days..

I did for a while but the reactions you get there and seeing your karma dry up made me leave in the end.

Will certainly do! But imo developing/mining/educating are the main things you can do as an individual to help.
