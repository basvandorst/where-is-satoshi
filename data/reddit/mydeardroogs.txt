I don't have any expertise in block chain, I have no qualms about admitting that, I'm purely just a spectator that's visiting this subreddit. But I think I've inadvertently triggered some landmines of discussion well known within the community as downvote worthy. Which I apologies for if indeed this post is unanimously regarded as naive or unworthy.
I have encountered this when talking to highly engaged people within the crypto community in real life. However they seem to have this similar exclusives only attitude. Which is totally understandable due to what you mentioned about grifters and venture capitalist trying to exploit crypto. 
However this antisocial attitude has consequences, especially when it is a technology that exists only through expanding engagement. I suppose you could say that if block chain was an organism it can't be both exclusive and inclusive, and it's engagement can't afford to be thoroughly selective as osmosis of certain sectors (vastly more power sectors) are certain to bully themselves through. I believe in the integrity of an organic global currency that is "governor-less" and "trustless." However I would be kidding myself if I didn't think that dream wasn't a form of ideological snake oil.

I thank you for your response and insight. I will do my homework on this a bit more.

I deleted my coinbase account and laying low until things seem more stable cryptocurrency wise. What would be a more interest or creative solution against all these pseudo banks passing off for exchanges?

Got my BTC, ETH, and LTC out successfully. Then I promptly deleted my coinbase account, they then texted me 2 pointless verification codes as a farewell. What a sad, sad website...
