The great thing about bitcoin is it functions both as a gold and cash hybrid.  It has the long term deflationary wealth storage benefits of gold along with the fluidity of cash.  This hybrid functionality is completely unprecedented in modern society.

The market is certainly volatile and prone to manipulation due to its size, this just comes with not yet being widely adopted to the scale of some national currencies.  As it grows the attempts at manipulation should become less and less noticeable, more like background noise.

Thanks.  Can I do both a paper wallet and encrypted backups of my wallet.dat or are they mutually exclusive?  Basically, I was planning to transfer all of my "savings" to a paper wallet and keep my "spending money" on blockchain.info (with double password and google authenticator of course).  If I do that, is there still a point to keeping encrypted copies of my wallet.dat since essentially everything is on the paper wallet?  
@_date: 2013-11-15 14:48:56

I think your best fail safe is to only transfer in a small amount at a time and just refill as necessary.  That way if it ever failed, got banned, or he just ran with the funds you would only be out a small amount, like the reddit tipbot.  
@_date: 2013-11-07 19:05:09
That's a shame, I would like to see tipbots established for all major social media sites, SMS, browsers, etc. (a lot of these already exist).  Even if they aren't utilized much now it is great idea to get the infrastructure in place for when the demand hits.

@_date: 2013-05-14 18:49:38
Someone else pointed that out to me as well, I was unaware.  You could certainly buy a gift card to your local grocery store or amazon with bitspend though and then use that giftcard when ordering your diapers thereby receiving your discount.  I agree though Gyft does have some advantages over bitspend.    
@_date: 2013-04-03 13:07:46

A good way to handle it is to give half payment up front, he sends the coins then you pay the last half.  That way both buyer and seller assume the same amount of risk (half of the total purchase).

I didn't downvote him but I have seen this exact phrase used multiple times across reddit whenever someone bitcoin tips.  I'm pretty sure at this point its just people pretending to be newbies in the hopes that someone will tip them.

@_date: 2013-06-04 18:12:50
To be honest, I cant really think of a way it offers an improvement over 2-factor, just an alternative.  I do really like the idea of only allowing one withdrawal address though, I think that would essentially solve the hacking problem (from Gox's side at least).  
@_date: 2013-03-22 14:03:35
But by that point the number of transactions will have grown exponentially, nice.  Thanks for the clarification!
@_date: 2013-05-18 03:41:38
You can change it up a bit and should be able to get it. 
@_date: 2013-04-04 20:48:40
They assign a fee in addition to your deposit request and that fee in combination with your deposit amount is unique to the penny for your account so they know where to put it.  Example, I want to deposit $2,000, they charge $45.76 so my total deposit is $2045.76.  They know that total amount is assigned to my account where if someone else wanted to deposit $2,000 they would assign them a fee of $45.77 so their total deposit is slightly different than yours even though you are getting the same amount of money in the end.  This is how the separate and track the trasactions.  If you accidently deposited $2045.77 instead of .76 your deposit would be credited to their account instead of yours, whoops!
@_date: 2013-11-12 14:54:38

No idea, hadn't heard much about it since it was introduced so I just wanted to raise awareness.  I would think the developer would promote it a bit more considering he gets a small transaction fee.

This is great.  It's the ability to share bitcoins easily like this tool and the tipbot that will be the biggest contributors in my opinion to mass adoption.  I think a lot of people even on this subreddit have already forgotten about the facebook tipbot that was created as well and I have considered making a post to remind / inform people of its existence.  
@_date: 2013-10-03 18:58:21
I bet that made you nearly shit yourself  
@_date: 2013-11-18 21:40:14
The merchant adoption is not what is driving the value now, scarcity is. This is a gold rush where everyone is trying to get their hands on a limited commodity. It is already established that bitcoin allows for global liquid transactions, it takes a while for merchant adoption to come around but the utility and scarcity are already in play.
@_date: 2013-05-06 12:26:55

@_date: 2013-11-21 03:58:39
It's also a deflationary store of wealth with limited supply that will increase in value with wider adoption.  limited supply + increasing demand = higher value.  It may be wise to offer discounts to customers paying in bitcoin and hold a portion of the coins.  
They can use it to move large payments internationally to company divisions, suppliers. contractors, instantly for less than a dollar.  Automate micro payments, accept global online payments, etc.
@_date: 2013-03-25 19:45:17

@_date: 2013-04-03 14:24:19
Exactly.  If you want to take some value out of bitcoin then pay for things with bitcoin that you were already planning on buying anyway with fiat.  That way you save your fiat, take profits and encourage the growth of the bitcoin economy.  
@_date: 2013-06-24 12:51:50

Ok, so follow up, how would I go about deleting my wallet after I have it backed up to make sure all copies are gone except those I have backed up.

Regarding the e-mail authorization, I agree it's easier to understand for the general public, not that 2-factor is hard though, some people are just scared to try something new (and if that's the case I doubt they would be playing with bitcoin).  
I think the one withdrawal address should really be a no brainer for gox though, instantly removes any headache from having to play detective for fraudulent activity, or be liable for lawsuits, etc.   It's not like it's any harder to send the coins out once they hit your Qt wallet.

Start by converting a modest amount (1 or 2 paychecks) and see if you can use it to obtain everything you need (gas, food, rent, utilities, etc.) and report back.  My guess is it is still too early to survive on without converting back to fiat.

That's why I normally just give a brief explanation and steer them towards @_date: 2013-05-14 18:20:47
You can enter the public addresses into blockchain.info as "watch-only" and keep a eye on all of the paper wallets.  I keep a couple of live BTC on blockchain.info for spending and just watch the rest of the paper wallets so it has my complete BTC total displayed but even if someone was to hack my account past 2 factor authentication they would only have access to a couple coins.  
@_date: 2013-06-06 13:47:27
Are you factoring in the *additional* difficulty increases during your 3-5 month break even period?  That would significantly delay your ROI or even render it impossible.

Offer significant discounts for goods &amp; services when paid in bitcoin if you believe in the long term viability of it as a currency.  This is a win-win for a few reasons;
* Consumers have incentive to spend their coin because they can get a great deal on products they would have bought anyway with fiat.
* Retailers drive sales for their business as well as the bitcoin economy while at the same time acquiring bitcoin which they believe will be worth even more in the future than the discount they offered to get them.

The way I understand it, imagine 1 bitcoin got spray painted orange and everyone could see it.  You could divide that bitcoin into as many pieces as you wanted and distribute them (to shareholders for example) and everyone could see that the holder of that colored coin was an owner of a share of the original bitcoin (or company).

Maybe I am misunderstanding how taintcoins would work but if the US decides to declare certain coins 'tainted" or certain addresses "clean" that doesn't mean any other country has to honor their designations, they would just proceed as normal by effectively ignoring the US economy.

Who's to say you cant walk out on him once he sends the coins?  With my method both parties are risking 50% stake in the transaction, first you trust him then he trusts you.  With the method you just described who's to say you wouldn't just walk out on him once you see the transaction has confirmed?  Then he is assuming 100% risk and you are assuming 0%.

If the price were really to go to $10,000 or $100,000+ per coin as some people are claiming it could, would people really feel like it was a good investment of their $100 or so to buy 0.001 coins?

@_date: 2013-05-24 18:46:11
Not actually since if bitcoin prices rise like crazy they would have been better off just spending the $400 on bitcoin.  The only way you can consider this profitable is if it has mined more than it's price in bitcoins (i.e. $400 = 3.07 BTC so until it mines at least 3.07 BTC it is not generating any profit, and that is excluding the cost of electricity).  More than likely with the increase in hashing difficulty it will never be able to mine 3.07 BTC so the money would be better spent just buying BTC.  
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:13:10

Right now the market cap is so small that "small" transactions from a global monetary scale (in the order of a half million dollars, etc.) can cause huge swings in the market.

@_date: 2013-11-18 15:00:26
People keep making this incorrect assumption that the price is based on usage at the moment.  It's not.  It's based on utility and scarcity right now.  
The utility is already proven by its ability to instantly and anonymously send any amount of money to anyone on the planet at any time with near zero fees and no third party intermediaries.  The other part driving price is a virtual gold rush to get as many bitcoins as possible right now because they are only going to become more scarce as time goes on with block reward halving, and the hard cap/deflationary nature built into the currency. 
Merchant adoption will continue to increase with legitimization such as these hearings but widespread (global) adoption is still a few years away once a stable value is realized which could be north of $50,000+ who knows for sure.  Right now it's all about the utility and deflationary nature of the protocol which has never been seen in the history of the world.  
This is just starting, wait until the gold bugs, hedge fund managers, remittances market, debit card transactions, gambling, porn, drugs, third world banking deserts, microtransactions, etc. get in on the game, you haven't seen anything yet.

Sorry, I do not have a link to share, all I know is just from reading other posts in Since colored coins are only used to represent ownership and not actually exchange value I believe you would receive something like 0.00000001 BTC representing a share and would probably be kept in a separate wallet which is not intended to be spent and if you did you would be transferring your share.  Not sure about needing a separate client to distinguish them if they got mixed with standard bitcoins.  Sorry I dont have more insight, I'm probably not the best person to be speaking about them

I said it before but I think a great way to drive incentive is for retailers to offer significant (25-50%?)discounts for goods &amp; services when paid in bitcoin if you believe in the long term viability of it as a currency. This is a win-win for a few reasons;
* Consumers have incentive to spend their coin because they can get a great deal on products they would have bought anyway with fiat.
* Retailers drive sales for their business as well as the bitcoin economy while at the same time acquiring bitcoin which they believe will be worth even more in the future than the discount they offered to get them.

The idea of bitcoins is awesome, not like anything that has ever existed and opens of so many avenues for cooperation and commerce that were just not possible before.  It will be seen as a threat however because it is a direct challenge to the current government run currencies because it exists outside of any central governing authority.  They will not give up money/power/control easily and there will be economic pain that comes along with it for those entities &amp; economies but it is for the greater good of mankind.

I think paypal adopting bitcoin would launch it as a globally recognized payment system and lend it credibility with the general public that it needs in the long term.  If paypal manipulates their policies to be anti-consumer then eventually people would just shift from using paypal to facilitate bitcoin transactions to just transacting in bitcoin itself outside of the paypal network.

Have seen this style chart a lot, where is it from?  What does the vertical green line in the center mean?  Thanks.

I saw one guy ordered 4 minirigs   :O
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:05:53
It's streams of 0.01BTC and 0.02BTC transactions.  That's not the traffic from the general public.  
@_date: 2013-06-21 16:31:56
This my friends is how it's done, bravo.

I'm a member of that group, want to attend a meet up but the scheduling hasn't worked out for me so far.  Will check their calendar again to see if I can make it happen.

You can already buy everything on amazon, as well as all other major retailers

If I encrypt and backup multiple copies of my wallet.dat file on jump drives, etc. do I need to get rid of my original wallet.dat file somehow so that it cant still be stolen?

People could always just transfer it of Gox and sell with another exchange if the needed to convert right?   Sure they would take a premium hit with the difference in exchange prices but that just goes to show the price on Gox isn't a real reflection of the value of bitcoin.  By that same token though why doesn't Gox price drop down to the actual value you can convert bitcoin to like on bitstamp?

It's funny reading these "old" comments.  Still unhappy about that $46 buy?   ;)
@_date: 2013-11-05 20:16:54
What is the best exchange where you could catch that low price when it bounces back so quickly?  
@_date: 2013-04-11 01:46:26
If you look at the stabilization after the correction it is totally a dampening sinusoidal wave.  Very nice assurance that once everyone has a chance to catch their breath and reload we will be right back in business as people grab this buying opportunity.

I said before, the spike and crash of 2011 is barely going to even be readable on the charts in a few months, it will just look like background noise.

if you're in the usa then coinbase is probably your best bet unless you want to meet in person and pay a higher fee for anonymity then localbitcoins.com would be another option.

Or they could just be shorting it and want to drive it to zero.  
@_date: 2013-10-27 14:15:04
Both, the device would have been fine if I got it a month or two ago but now it won't break even.

Yes and yes.  I have never used Linux even once before and the idea of creating a boot disk with it, navigating using the command prompt, etc. is very intimidating I dont even know where to start.  For instance, there seem to be so many versions of Linux out there I have no idea which one to even choose.  All the instructions I have read for creating a boot disk read like greek to me.  Trying to decide the best method that doesn't involve going down that road.

They crashed pretty hard right from like 4BTC to 0.5?

This is a very insightful post, thanks for contributing it.  This is how we should be thinking about bitcoin and cryptography in general, it has the opportunity to revolutionize record keeping everywhere.

Story time?
@_date: 2013-11-17 18:15:54
Yes, very good plan.  This is essentially what I do.  Multiple paper wallets in graduated amounts for secure savings.  One online wallet with a small amount for occasional purchases.

Might as well just start calling them credits
@_date: 2013-04-29 18:48:57
My go to saying is that it gives you the ability to send any amount of money to anyone else on the planet instantly * , anonymously * and securely at any time for free *.    
*minor caveats but I only get into this if I get into a more serious discussion.

For anyone interested in learning more about bitcoin, [here is an explanation I wrote]( in an attempt to lay it out in a way that a non-bitcoin user can understand.  Feel free to ask me any questions you may have.
