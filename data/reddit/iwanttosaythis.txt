How BFX decides internally to handle people's deposits it's up to their discretion. Why do you have the right to your funds and people that lost their money don't? You both did the exact same thing: transfer money to BFX. Are other people shit out of luck because the did it 24 hours before you? Does that seem fair to you?
And I say this as someone who's BFX wallet WASN'T drained.
Edit: btw asking Zane the same thing over and over and over again will NOT influence the course of action BFX is going to take.

Wow. Worst $50 spent ever. 
Isn't it fucking obvious there's something wrong with it? Why do you think the price for BTC is $260 right now?
Sorry for the harshness, but where have you been? You didn't figure there's something wrong with it yet? How can some people stay alive?

Yes but there's people unable to take coins out from 2 of the major exchanges right now, MtGox and Bitstamp.
I am just wondering what would qualify as "read damage" in your book.
@_date: 2014-03-05 21:52:57
People that daytrade generally keep coins in the exchange, news at 9.
@_date: 2014-03-09 18:32:18
I cannot upvote this enough.
This has to be the stupidest "leak" I've seen in my life. OF COURSE their internal systems will show they have the coins, but these are not real coins, these are just numbers in their DB.
You know how else you could see these numbers months ago without having to crack anything, by logging into your Gox account and checking your BTC balance. Where do you think that number was coming from? 
Think about it this way. You have a room originally with 100 people in and a guy in the front door counting how many have left. You steal the guy's notebook and it says "50 people have left", and you're going "THIS IS PROOF there's still 50 people in". 
NO IT'S NOT, turns out there was a backdoor that the guy didn't know about and there's no people left in the room.

Ah, I see, apologies for putting words in your mouth you didn't say.
We do agree though that the invalid transactions they were issuing was not the *primary* reason they were loosing coins right? Unless my understanding of the problem is completely wrong.

Don't ever ever make financial decisions based on posts.
@_date: 2014-02-22 19:53:38
So I've been thinking. There has to be an unequivocal way to say "let me check if these coins have reached the target", right?
Assuming there is an unequivocal way to check that, why would it be unsafe to reissue an non-conflicting transaction for the same amount?
@_date: 2014-02-22 20:26:04
That makes sense.
I believe that, IF Gox is really working on something, they are working on improving that HAS test to make it more resilient and non exploitable (within their risk tolerance), and not so much on addressing the source of invalid transactions itself.
Their main problem was that their HAS test was very simple and based solely on txId, thus easily exploitable. 
Anyhow, this is all speculation, thanks for your time again!
@_date: 2014-02-22 18:33:22
See, the thing is, this issue is not why Gox suspended transactions. 
They've had this issue for a long time. They suspended transactions because they were using txId as primary key, so malleability was being exploited to take coins away from them.
This just proves the invalid transaction issue is not fixed, which doesn't surprise me since they must be concentrating on the txId issue.
@_date: 2014-02-13 20:12:24
Let me guess, you have the idea, but you need someone to code it for you.
Now, you're not planning to pay this person up front, you're going  to tell them how good your idea is, and try to convince that they are really not wasting time, but investing in their future because of the obvious amount of money the site will make.
And if they refuse to do work up front, you will wonder how someone can have such shortsightedness and tell them "well it's your loss".
Sorry, bad memories.

Yeah we need to know. Was it a cappuccino?? If yes this is completely outrageous as those cost more but they actually have LESS coffee in them!!!1
@_date: 2014-02-22 18:55:02
That's exactly what I was saying... I don't see how my post was inaccurate.
You can modify the transaction to have a different txId but it is still the *same* transaction. The primary key is what gives something its identity, and using txId as primary key is fundamentally wrong.
What you're saying is "don't use txId as primary key, use its inputs", which is exactly what I was saying.

Being "short" of something simply means you have the obligation of buying it back.
You can short BTC you own and you're planning to keep long term, you can borrow coins from a friend to short them, also there's exchanges that let you short them.
@_date: 2014-02-11 00:13:56


No, that's not actually it. Bitcoin is not anonymous.
@_date: 2014-02-14 20:25:43
Your problem is that you have your life savings in BTC. That was a very stupid thing to do. All your problems come from that. You are making rush decisions because of it.
Also, you are wanting to become a millionarie really fast. What other explanation could be to invest ALL your money in something so volatile as BTC? 
If you want more security, why not go with other more traditional methods of investment? 
If you are going to stay in BTC, LEAVE YOUR HEART OUT of the equation. Never ever trade based on your feelings. Is it you assessment that BTC will grow? If yes, why sell on a panic on something that's not really a problem (like malleability).
Not sure this really helps. Just some food for thought I guess. 
Good luck!

@_date: 2014-03-09 17:51:36
I thought that was the WHOLE jist of this. Of course if you dump their DB you will see what they are *supposed* to have.
Now I'm not saying Mark is not lying, but IF we assume their coins were stolen by exploiting an accounting bug, that means their accounting systems ARE NOT going to reflect the theft.
This proves absolutely nada.

Listen, in the real world there's rules, and nobody cuts you any slack when you don't read or understand them, SPECIALLY dealing with money. 
The fact here is simple, you didn't read the rules well enough and now you're calling the provider an "asshole" for not cutting you some slack.

@_date: 2013-12-02 15:22:02
Just for the record, I completely agree with you. I guess "crash" is not the best word for it, but maybe something like a "flash crash", since the price did go down more than 25% in a few hours, only to recover later.
In my mind yesterday's correction was the result of clever market manipulation by big players, which you could also say about the flash crash in the video.

Yeah, I like how everybody thinks of themselves as financial geniuses just because some predictions fail. Well guess what, some predictions fail, others don't. You can you all the analysis you want, but you can't predict the future.
With bitcoins everyone thinks they are geniuses, but the only reason for that is because it keeps going up. Guess what, it's really easy to make money with anything that just goes up. It doesn't require any kind of ability.

Investing is always the risk vs potential reward ratio. A savings account is super low risk (FIDC insured), but the reward is really low.
Bitcoin is the exact opposite. Extremely high risk, extremely high potential returns.
You just don't invest all your savings in something that risky. It may go well for you this time, but you just don't.
