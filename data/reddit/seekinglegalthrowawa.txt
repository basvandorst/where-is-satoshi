im not going to cash everything that i have just my starting  investment and  more to diversify/other investments instead of having the majority of it tied up 
I guess at the expense of being able to spend more than 10,000 at a time ill pay thetaxes

not quite sure what this means, do you care to elaborate? looking to follow the law on this just bought my bitcoins in a way more convenient for me and didnt think that it would turn to this

hi thanks for the response, 
I am currently waiting for coinlab to open in order to verify an account with them but i guess my main concern is that I have no real proof of purchasing bitcoins at where i did under my identity, 
Yes I am from the US, but im concerned that there would be question as to proving how I came across the amount, I guess its also because ive never paid taxes on an area like this as well as this amount,

Thank you so much for this reply, I hope others in the same situation also find this information useful 
I will follow your advice and seek advice from a tax accountant i appreciate your insight pretty much this is what my train of thought was and feel better hearing it from someone who knows better than i do!, 
Considering I am willing to pay the taxes im sure someone will be happy to take the money somewhere 
again thank you so much

Ok but im asking what you meant by provinding consuting with the buyer? whose is the buyer? 
 what is FOMC shit?, 
also it sounds shady i dont care how much tax it is that i have to pay just what i have to file this under and how i can go about doing it correctly

I want to pay taxes, the amount is more than im able to hide and want to do more with it than just live off it forever in small amounts,
