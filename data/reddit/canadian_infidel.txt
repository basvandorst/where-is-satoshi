This makes me happy.
@_date: 2014-01-19 01:25:15
I am not aware. This seems to be the key fact.
@_date: 2014-01-22 02:40:11
No, they should ask first. They make mistakes and they know it so there is no reason not too. My AV software has to ask, for example, before it starts deleting things.
@_date: 2014-01-25 00:26:32


That's the point of bitcoin. I bet it cost them less than 50k in labor/contractors. Hell, maybe less than twenty.

In the 90's when screensavers were the cool thing to collect I used to distribute .scr files that were infected so I could eventually amass a whole swarm of computers under my control. The point is, .scr files are treated as .exe's (in win95 at least). I got kicked of the internet by the RCMP for a year, almost permanently. I was ahead of my time though considering it was in 99. If I had anything other than dialup I would have been great. How did I get caught? I didn't want to steal anyone else's internet hours so I just used my own even though I had collected many.
@_date: 2014-02-10 23:23:50
Bitcoins are going back in time!
@_date: 2014-02-10 23:17:31
It makes no sense why it could possibly cost that much. What is that money spent on? In all seriousness. Sounds like yet another hurdle that exists solely to keep new people out.
@_date: 2014-01-28 04:10:30
That doesn't prove them innocent. It just means they couldn't legally technically get them. You would have to be pretty naive to think this was all just one big coincidental misunderstanding. With fines.
@_date: 2014-01-19 01:26:26
The increasing difficulty rate is very surprising. This could have blindsided me.
@_date: 2014-02-12 22:33:53
Somebody should do online banking and just send 10k back and forth between two accounts until the FBI shows up.
@_date: 2014-01-17 23:57:11
That's just it. Even at more than double the difficulty it would pay for itself in six weeks.
@_date: 2014-02-10 23:13:20
What would you really need? 200k?
@_date: 2014-01-19 01:21:16
But even with 3x the difficulty I pays for itself. What is the projected difficult then?
These are the numbers I get, note the difficulty set. It seems good to me.
@_date: 2014-02-10 23:11:14
So do they think they tried to scam people or did they just fail at programming?
@_date: 2014-01-22 02:20:11
If it does something people don't want, then it is doing something it shouldn't do.
@_date: 2013-11-01 04:38:21
Deep packet inspection and rejection of bitcoin related packets. If they DDOS the network for a month or three the price will tank and that will be that.
@_date: 2013-05-29 22:30:55
It is absolutely not caution. It is protectionism, they just figured out how to get away with it.
@_date: 2013-08-23 02:32:09
I've followed the whole thing. He might be a little nuts, but personally I don't think he did. He was only accused of that after he refused to pay off third world government officials.
@_date: 2013-08-17 22:46:09
An anonymous guy name Satoshi. Nobody knows who he is. He is the "issuer" but since they can't find him they will assign his legal responsibilities to others.
@_date: 2013-07-03 20:04:01
Isn't that illegal? Could they stop you from making political contributions then? Why don't they?
@_date: 2013-08-16 04:16:34
They don't hunt actual criminals.
@_date: 2013-06-18 02:56:46
Because the opportunity cost of bitcoin mining increases with both time and bitcoins mined. They are a finite resource remember.

We rank better in health care than the united states.
@_date: 2013-06-08 03:35:36
This will never make it to television.
@_date: 2013-08-16 04:14:18
It probably does.
@_date: 2013-12-19 04:42:50
Millions were lost. People get crazy about that kind of thing.
@_date: 2013-12-19 22:25:19
All auction sites would need to be blocked. Auctions both live and over the net are ways to launder money.
@_date: 2013-10-18 23:30:26
I was wrong. It was 5%.
@_date: 2013-10-05 21:43:42
They would send agents to the family homes of those who run the exchanges first, just to let them know what they better do and not do.
@_date: 2013-10-02 20:34:13
These are intelligence people talking. I believe nothing they say. This could easily be a smear campaign created to distract from the debate about what he is really being taken in for.
@_date: 2013-09-22 03:30:42
Your grandma does, and old people outnumber us.
@_date: 2013-12-11 04:39:22
Unless the parents agree. In that case, keep reminding yourself you are the sane one and keep your head down until you are old enough to get control of your life.
@_date: 2013-12-07 04:03:10
No way. I'm thinking 600 will be the bottom, maybe even 400. Then it will snap back to a solid 800 and level off for a bit again, maybe go back to 1000. A fair portion of the circulation really is used for transactions. I've been on this since it's inception. I was blocked from purchasing due to these paperwork issues all the way through the climb from 250+. I had been watching since the paper was first released. I do not want to miss this coming bump. If it hits 1000 again I would sell if it does it by noon tomorrow. If after 24hr it's at 800 also prepare to sell based on how volatile it is starting to be at this point.
@_date: 2013-12-14 01:07:39
They know this is bad for the economy and the people. They are not stakeholders in the future of either. They are only responsible to themselves.
@_date: 2013-10-08 04:20:58
Nah, they will just go after people he cares about.
@_date: 2013-05-07 00:02:33
It means forcing someone to pay "protection" money.
@_date: 2013-12-17 03:29:22
This is illegal.
@_date: 2013-11-28 22:51:41
Got it. Magic.
@_date: 2013-08-23 02:34:32
Better to keep them in the dark.
@_date: 2013-09-09 04:34:04
There is a 100% chance I will use them. That is a fact.
@_date: 2013-11-29 03:34:19
And STILL I wait to have my account verified...
@_date: 2013-10-05 21:43:00
I read today they want to liquidate their holdings once the case is over.
@_date: 2013-12-01 22:57:26
I think it's great. I've been waiting for a correction so I can invest! I will only do $1k probably. I will try my best to use it as a purchasing account and I will try to just spend the interest.
@_date: 2013-12-07 04:01:11
Ok, but you can only get 50 dollars a day that way.
@_date: 2013-06-03 21:58:20
It's a scam if they are letting people cut in line because the value of the product only goes down with time.
@_date: 2013-11-07 21:24:45
Yup. Then they will subsidize that form of payment and take over. It will be as bad a pay-pal except global and instant and it will be yet another way for the man to nickel and dime you. Now they will get a piece of everything all the way down to person to person cash transfers.
@_date: 2013-08-17 01:33:44
So kind of like the US dollar?
@_date: 2013-12-19 22:22:40
Yep. The only place more expensive than the US is Canada.
@_date: 2013-08-16 04:15:21
You just wait. In 20 years there will be rollout of internet2 or n2 ask the kids call it. You will need to swipe your social insurance card to log in.
@_date: 2013-11-27 21:15:10
Yeah man. I've got all my paperwork into the two different exchanges. I've gone to the bank and so on. I have tried help tickets, and anything else I could think of. They must be getting inundated, or they don't have the manpower to process the documents.
@_date: 2013-06-04 21:24:44


One group controls politics, they are called the elites. They are divided, but only on social issues. The rest is all true without caveats.
@_date: 2013-10-06 00:55:02


They employ hundreds of thousands. For a high profile situation like this they would spend the man power.
@_date: 2013-06-10 03:00:58
It's important because VISA and Mastercard and many banks blocked donations to Wikileaks. You can't embargo or block bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-11-07 03:18:22
This might mean they need to "take the gloves off" too. The will just outlaw any currency they can't control. ie: You will not be able to use bitcoins without every receipt going to the government.
@_date: 2013-10-18 21:30:06
That info is available to anyone. You must be new to bitcoin. They were 10% of the market at max.
@_date: 2013-05-19 17:45:26


This is the news.  Not that they exist.
@_date: 2013-12-29 21:48:34
Only a few percent of any currency is physical.
@_date: 2013-07-04 00:52:14
You say that like it's a good thing.
Seems like something that should be illegal if it isn't. Especially in modern times where a single person can derail a political institution because they own a bank or credit card company.
@_date: 2013-12-23 03:25:35
Warren Buffet
@_date: 2013-11-01 04:37:40
Actually I have heard they are supporting it so far at least state sponsored media portrays it somewhat favorably.
@_date: 2013-12-17 03:33:40
I think that the power families know that this big life support system we built is going to run out of fuel eventually and they have been hoarding for decades.
@_date: 2013-09-22 03:30:29
And terrorism.
@_date: 2013-12-29 01:44:16
Is he calling for bitcoiners to arm themselves?
@_date: 2013-10-14 00:35:43
He's a wealthy man who's likely seen behind more than a few closed doors who has obligations to no one and isn't afraid to call it like he sees it.
@_date: 2013-07-04 02:01:32
My bad. Sadly I see super conservatives on here that would say that without being sarcastic.
@_date: 2013-10-12 17:05:21
Ask for proof the account is empty. Make sure to ask him in a way that doesn't allow him to simply empty it first.
@_date: 2013-12-10 04:09:47
Jobs would have been ALL over this. Imagine iPhone as an instant global wallet and banking system.
@_date: 2013-11-01 04:36:51
As long as they leave regular banking websites, news sites, and facebook and youtube up nobody will care. Eventually you will need a license to transmit any data at all, let alone run a server.
@_date: 2013-10-19 21:28:31
I proved I was twice as right, you fucking piece of human filth. I hope your mother gets cancer.
@_date: 2013-10-18 23:29:03
Sorry, 5%.
I just assumed people here followed these kinds of things. Personally I have never been more confident in the currency. Silk Road closing only proves that it can easily rebound from that kind of shock. The price indicates the same.
@_date: 2013-08-16 04:22:08
Have a problem with it? They will drone strike you.
@_date: 2013-04-29 05:37:41
According to any official body that ranks such things.
@_date: 2013-11-27 21:47:29
That is basically the conclusion I came to regarding my computer. I didn't want to stress the heat sinks. The electricity is included in my rent though.
@_date: 2013-12-07 04:01:38
cavirtex has been 'processing' my application for a solid month. They just sent an email saying they are hiring more people to catch up. I sort of have to move on.
@_date: 2013-10-06 16:23:45
I'm sure they are not morally opposed to it. What is your point? Certainly not more than the US because by definition 90+% of heroin comes from US controll Afghanistan. At most Russia could do the last 10%.
@_date: 2013-06-05 04:20:24
Then you probably aren't elite, although you might be the pet of one.
@_date: 2013-06-30 18:36:12
That's ridiculous.
@_date: 2013-08-23 02:32:54
Perhaps I should start keeping cash in a safety deposit box... I don't think you have to disclose what's in there.
@_date: 2013-10-10 23:56:27
I doubt this was by choice.
@_date: 2013-06-05 20:11:02
Most pets don't require a leash.
@_date: 2013-05-11 19:55:45
Maybe legally. They are still assholes. That would be like buying up farmland as fast as possible, farming it, and then burning it all... in an area where people don't have enough farm land.
@_date: 2013-10-08 20:46:11
It doesn't have to get crazy. They may just deny his kids admission to a school or maybe get them expelled with their scholarship gone or any number of things.
@_date: 2013-10-05 18:04:50
Which should serve as nothing more than a reminder to DO THE SAME.
@_date: 2013-05-11 04:15:59
They should turn that machine off. They are burning other people's money.
@_date: 2013-12-14 01:08:00
Uh. No.
@_date: 2013-12-14 01:08:53
You make it sound like if they understood that it was good for the people they would go for it. LOL. This is about control.
@_date: 2013-06-10 23:49:20
Only if you are trying to block the use of paypal. I mean why do you have to be a financial institution to pay with them? I don't need to be a bank to pay with USD versus Canadian Dollars do I? No.
@_date: 2013-11-15 22:25:20
This is a banking app. I can transfer money between accounts with my banking app, including to different currencies.
@_date: 2013-12-01 02:02:40
Wow... 22,000 will literally change someones life.
@_date: 2013-05-11 22:35:36
Which is illegal.
@_date: 2013-12-04 21:59:24
This is awesome. I bet the city *saves* overhead this way!
@_date: 2013-11-27 21:17:41
I got 40 dollars mining in two weeks of mining 90% of the time by todays prices. I realize now I shouldn't have stopped. I would have a thousand by now. My understanding is you get less out of it now though. Plus it's the only untraceable 40 dollars I will ever have. Except now I just said that so now it's not:)
