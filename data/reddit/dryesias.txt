Here's the thing though, Bitcoin only adjusts the difficulty every 2016 blocks. If Bitcoin were to have a high difficulty after recently hitting that block, and then suddenly lose all it's hashing power, the meager hashing power still left on the network would take forever per block, slowing confirmations to a crawl and taking an eternity to get to that 2016 block to readjust.
So yes, in theory, if the reward got low enough (BTC value), and it had recently had updated the difficulty, it could die. It'd be a self-reinforcing death spiral, value crashing, miners fleeing because no profit, confirmations getting longer, so value drops, so more miners abandon. If it were to suddenly lose 95% of hashing power, each block would take 200 minutes, and if that 2016 block had just happened, that's 280 days for a difficulty adjustment (versus the normal 14ish days if blocks are mined close to 10 minutes).

Satoshi is a one in a generation kind of genius, but he couldn't possibly foresee all the insanity he set in motion. 
The difficulty updating worked great, because initially the amount of hashing power was increasing quickly. Intended block time is 10 minutes, but in the early days, let's say hashing power is doubled, so block times drop to 5 minutes, well in less than 7 days it'll correct itself, so it's fine. But I don't think you could  know that ASICs would come to dominate mining, that also conveniently are equally adept at mining a competing chain, leading to sudden large losses of mining power that slow down the difficulty update, rather than causing the difficulty adjustment to speed up like you do with sudden large increases.
