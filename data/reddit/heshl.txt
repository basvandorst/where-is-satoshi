They will instantly convert all of it to USD. Bitcoin is, and will always be, completely unstable. It's an unregulated currency with a low market capitalization, that's just part of the package.

You asked for an unregulated currency, you got an unregulated currency.

OK just the first 2, my bad, honest mistake.

Really? I thought you all were a bunch of paranoid drug-abusing pedophiles, but correct me if I'm wrong.

The people who own the most of them are botnet operators who got on the train early. Or maybe they've all cashed out already selling them to the tech-savvy male crowd, who knows.

Right. We're just having a little harmless circlejerk, ya'll have gone full human centipede.

Wait. You're arguing *for* bitcoin, a completely unregulated currency?

If by porn, you mean "long-term geopolitical crisis caused by nuclear armed states", then yeah.
@_date: 2013-11-26 02:09:01
Yup. Same kind of wild speculative bubble.

The reason he's not telling you to invest in bitcoins is the same reason he's not telling you to put everything into penny stocks.
@_date: 2013-11-26 02:11:13
None of that will happen because BTC sales are likely to screw over one of the parties thanks to its grossly unstable price.
@_date: 2013-11-26 02:15:41
Until the speculative bubble bursts.

You apparently don't know how currency works. When a currency has an unstable value, it means people do not have a good reason to trade with it. If the market crashes the day after a sale, the seller got screwed out of their wealth. If the market boomed, then the reverse is true.
