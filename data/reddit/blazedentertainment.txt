Let’s say he opens a channel with: yalls, Blockstream Store, Satoshis place, and a satoshis dice. 
He’s now providing a one hop route to all of the stores I might only care about ATM. Saving me from either opening up channels with each of these stores myself, or relying on multiple hops if I only choose to open with one of these Lapps. 
Plus diversity in LN is pretty important. Can’t have my one channel to yalls go down and stop my ability to make LN transactions. 
LN game mechanics are interesting. There was a good post by Alex Bosworth over node selection.

Not always the case. About a year ago, placed an order with them. They reached out to me saying there was a problem with my Pizza Hut order, made a Dominos order instead, and threw in some extra breadsticks. 
Not saying \_you\_ weren't scammed, and that they aren't unreliable, just that it's not a scam in general, or used to not be at least.

There’s a difference in being a full mode and being a lightning node. 
Being a lightning node, he’s allowing people to open channels with him, and if he’s reliable and opens more connections, then he provides value to the lightning network overall.

Agreed. 
I hear from OP, it’s ok for some places to write FUD articles but not this one. Why? Because YOU put too much trust behind them? That sounds like your problem, and anyone else doing so. 
Also, true or false, it REALLY does not change anything. Get the dollar signs out of your eyes and see what’s going on. 
By all means, write your letter. I agree that it’s a good idea. But don’t expect any change other than the change you need to go through yourself.

Completely understandable. I wouldn’t do business with any company / person that did me wrong like that.

We already did go our own way and make our own rules. It’s called Bitcoin. 
We don’t need an ETF/SEC to function as intended.

I don’t know why everyone keeps running so hard to centralized services. What do you expect to happen?

You can do this with BTC too. Nobody is using Dash. Lol.

There’s many ways to use BTC during a blackout, though it requires many people to prepare. Can’t be the only person with a satellite, who you gonna send to? Though text sending is possible with Samurai I believe.

Only butt hurt I see here is yours. Nobody is using Dash. Lol. 
@_date: 2019-03-13 03:09:14
No, that's not what I said. Bitcoin in a blackout is possible, but not feasible in this situation, or most situations, unless many people are already prepared for a blackout.

Because these asshats KYC now. Instantly off my radar.

As someone that talks to normal people that have at one point received something like this, there’s lots of joy in having them recheck that wallet they received in 2012 and get excited about it. They then go and express that to the gifter. 
Why do you want them to spend the money right away? Do you need that instant gratification when it comes to gifts? 
Do you know how many pointless fucking gifts I’ve given that never get used either? At least this could get people involved into the crypto ecosystem and we all benefit from that.

Didn’t they just disable USA accounts?

I don’t think btcd has a mainnet parameter (its by default) so I’d strip it from the docker script (or at least I had to a month ago, not sure if they updated it). 
@_date: 2018-04-24 13:05:09
Without the code pulled up, it expects you to either be on simnet or on testnet. So the btcd command for that is `btcd —testnet [other params]` 
So essentially taking out `—$NETWORK` completely from the btcd script (either start.sh or dockerfile, I forgot) is what you want to kick it to mainnet. There is no `—mainnet` param.

No, you have to mail it to all of the node operators to get them to accept your block. 
Wait, that’s not the point, it’s to learn about blockchain and hashing you fucking moron.

It was just over a year ago they did. 2 years ago they had no plans and it was just supposed to be a multi card. Unfortunately 2 years ago I bought their card and it doesn’t work at any stores. They sold something that “sorry, you can’t use our cards at 99% of places. Fundraise us and we’ll get it working in a couple months.” Now they are still no where close. Good luck with the scamming card processor.

I don’t expect my dead grandma to understand bitcoin. I expect my cypherpunk website to.
