This is plain bullshit. Look at the fees! Bitcoin is not a cryptocurrency anymore. People just buy it to sell it. I don't have any hope for Bitcoin, it has become a too big issue to be fixed. 
It might not crash, but I believe that everyone here knows that it is a useless "cryptogold"- well actually, you can at least wear gold. Bitcoin: nothing.

No convince needed. Just wanted opinions from others. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:35:10
You know much about it? 
Explain why you are still HODLing, or why not. Or are you one of those people who just want to double their USD that they invested with and leave?
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:12:28
Go read what btc was about. What it was meant to be. Then come back. This was no "industry" this was the exact opposite of "industrial" in fact, if we leave out the very big investors that have an effect on btc it is still unowned, uncontrolled, and independent. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:43:51
Im not saying anything about bcash, instead of just raging can one of you actually explain why bitcoin, why should I not sell, or why are you not selling?
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:17:10
Yes but I like to think of it this way, there are a bunch of other cryptocurrencies out there, and they all have very similar goals (like what bitcoin was supposed to be, what it was meant to be ). They capitalized this one, maybe ethereum after this one, then litecoin, Monero, zcash, ripple (wait- this is already owned by the banks :D), IOTA... But eventually one of them will succeed. This is my opinion.
@_date: 2017-12-27 06:39:58
Im prepared for the downvotes.
To be honest, it's only been like that for Bitcoin for me. I used to see different news about Bitcoin and how something "unique" would be added to it's use, but now all I hear about Bitcoin is the roasting for bitcoin cash, transaction fees, and lightning network - well I did not include the  HODL shit I see everyday. 
Anyway, I also follow other cryptos. I've read a lot about how Ledger will add Monero, how Bosch has invested in IOTA, how bitcoin cash will be used in alot of places hopefully soon... It goes on, I didn't even mention Ether and the Ethereum platform. 
So basically, like I said in another post, Bitcoin has nothing else to offer anymore than it's value, for now...
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:07:37
No I wanted opinions from people who support bitcoin, why do they still do (other than money) why do you? (Other than money). 
Is it that hard to understand this?
Yea cool Tuesday night. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:15:01
Yea, I still have bitcoin and Im not selling it. The main reason is because it takes too long and the transaction fee is too high, but like I said if these go away I will GLADLY except the fact that I was wrong. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:39:37
I did not use the word "magic" or my opinion from someone else, It just came to my mind while I was typing. 
The only thing you are talking about in this comment is "MONEY". So you are one of those people that just want to get some more dollars, yea, thought so.
I know you love smiley faces :) :)
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:24:02
Yes but that was not its purpose, it altered to this path...
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:36:23
About 1.5 months ago, I used it on steam. To be honest, that and some other minor shopping was all I was ever able to do.
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:56:07
I think if bitcoin was used as an global cryptocurrency, yes it would take the hit. But it wouldn't fall. Because if there is this high demand when it is useless, think what the demand would be when it would be in a different scenario. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:06:12
Yes, this is the "why it lost it's magic part". Good to know I am not the only one who thinks this way.
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:41:01
Because I did, used to. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:47:18
I have bitcoin don't worry, I tripled what I had tha ks to bitcoin but that was not the reason I bought bitcoin. Of course I like profit like everyone else but I would rather have bitcoins accuracy, low fees and everything else that made it interesting than profit, I'd rather have both in fact. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:39:44
I bet you didn't read the whole thing. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:00:15
"Greed, spiritual gain"?? English is not my main language so forgive me for not understanding some of the fancy words but "spiritual gain"? Nah, I don't see how that happens. 
But I believe if someone can express their opinion about my opinion in this specific tone, I believe they can explain why they still believe in bitcoin in a very clear and understandable tone too! (If there is one)
Now, I'd love to read that!
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:59:28
Hehe, I never said that I hated it did I? Think of it this way if I posted this in any other sub reddit than this one, most of the comments I would get would be different than what I am getting right now. Why do you think I posted it here? :)
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:10:09
If that happens I will GLADLY accept that I was wrong. But I'm afraid that btc might be too big and gaining "investors" too fast for people to do this. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:53:06
First of all thank you for a proper comment, but I disagree with your opinion. Steam started using bitcoin, bitpay was used in bunch of websites and we heard news every day how another company would consider bitcoin. I don't think this was the end goal. 
Sorry for the wrong choice of word by accuracy I meant the how there wasn't a transaction "line". 
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:04:44
See I want to know if anyone out here thinks the kit will loose weight and quit video games. But I also want to know why they think that. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:44:04
I will. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 06:19:44
It doesnt matter which scenerio, I think you should create a wallet and transfer everything you've got. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 06:17:02
Could you please explain? It'd be nice. (In basics please kind of very new.)
@_date: 2017-11-17 13:23:18
Hope it goes down to 5500 , if it does Im buyin at least one btc. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 15:05:07
We're good man. We're good.
@_date: 2017-11-17 14:36:22
Well then, good thing I posted this!
@_date: 2017-11-17 06:20:03
(If you still can)
@_date: 2017-11-17 13:22:27
The bitcoin segwit2x hardfork is expected to happen in the next hour. Coinbase and chainblock etc. has disabled transactions for security. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 13:35:57
Proof? I know there was a really low chance of the fork actually happening, but is there any proof you have for "the Fork that did not happen". 
@_date: 2017-11-17 06:22:08
Okay the best is hardware wallet such as Ledger , but as a temporary situation I used Blockchain where I could store both Eth and Btc, I dont think they have ltc so you might wanna google that part. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 20:47:00
Bullshit. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 13:26:15
This isn't a %100 accurate comment. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 13:36:43
Probably because of the fork attempt. Maybe one more day, maybe tonight, maybe tommorow?
dunno. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 06:28:24
I still don't trust exchanges as a secure wallet, even a paper wallet is more preferable in my opinion. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 13:41:10
Okay I read this. There is still a chance. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 13:25:03
Perfect. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 13:27:50
How can you ban bitcoin? You can only ban the usage and label using bitcoin illegal. Still even if they did you can find a way to buy btc pretty easily. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 14:17:05
hehe ok. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 06:41:36
Im gonna wake up around 6:10 to and just follow what happens. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 06:25:00
I want the same thing too man, I mean I will buy it either way but it would be nice to buy in a dip so we could get a couple extra btcs.
