Read note about credits alpha version tests, there are a lot of interesting information about transactions and how they reached such results.

Every single one of us, every technical person is curious about Satoshi. We want to know where this person came from and where bitcoin came from, because it's kind of a miracle, this system.. Whoever Satoshi Nakamoto is, he created a great thing, due to this a lot of big projects developing now, like Eos, Credits, Neo, Stellar...

I ve sold my house and bought credits! Now gonna buy 2 houses!

Theres no perfect time for anything I bet. In crypto shpere things change fast and the changes are unpredictable. What about me, I ve invested in BTC, EOS and CS half of a year ago and used to observe the situation in crypto sphere much longer before investing. I think its all about that, that you should examine, observe, test the projects, in which you would like to invest your money, only in that way you will not be left in the ruins :)

Im willing to tell you more about CREDITS. Basis of Credits platform is DPOS (delegated proof-of-stake) and BFT. On Credits platform there will be several types of nodes: common, trusted and main. There will be special voting process to become main node. Main node will gain reward for adding tx hash to the ledger.

It’s the ONLY coin I trust my money with for many reasons
@_date: 2018-04-21 12:31:12
Why ? 
@_date: 2018-04-16 16:10:42
I believe a deeper look into CREDITS platform would be warranted. Despite its meteoric rise in popularity, many do not understand the nuances and intricacies of the CREDITS project. The space has moved so quickly that many hesitate to develop an understanding of core fundamentals for fear of missing out on price movements.

Bitcoin has good pumps up these days. I hope it will become bigger and other coins will rise up also ( just invested in CS and EOS and waiting for the same rising! I think that will happen soon!) 
@_date: 2018-04-12 18:55:15
BTC is not bad but I think that they should moderate their technologies, like make a faster transactions, use a new DPOS type of consensus and other things like that, so, if they do it, as for example cs and eos already did, they will stay in top 30 market cup of all cryptocurrencies in the world, otherwise they will go down by time, because now there are a lot of new modern technoligies in crypto sphere are coming up daily.

I also have cs in my portfolio and they make me a good profit
@_date: 2018-04-17 15:46:44
What do you think of blockchain of CREDITS?
@_date: 2018-04-23 10:03:41
I’m trading with cs coins for 2 months only but they have already made me a great profit ! 
@_date: 2018-04-19 09:05:25
C meow meow
@_date: 2018-04-12 19:05:21
Well it is kind of predictable, I think. But currently I trust only to CS and EOS
@_date: 2018-04-17 15:57:36
Sponge bob square pants!! 
@_date: 2018-04-21 11:37:29
I think the best crypto to invest for beginners is Credits because this project is very legit and they have 24/7 clients support service 
@_date: 2018-04-14 15:49:59
What is CS guys ?
@_date: 2018-04-21 11:47:45
Haha congratulations! Time to buy credits ! 
@_date: 2018-04-12 16:48:22
I think that P2P network is gonna be more and more popular in future. Now already almost all platforms use peer-to-peer (P2P) basis. (example - credits)

Verge is in trouble no one will use that currency anymore cause it is associated with porn. Even I was thinking of buying it but prefered CS
@_date: 2018-04-24 13:12:10
Thats why i trust cs coins.. they have a very secure technologies
@_date: 2018-04-19 08:18:08
That verge company had lost all the respect from people and I think thats so unprofessional for such a big company.. Thats exactly why I prefer more professional projects like Stellar or Credits

Crypto is not only btc. It is also other great projects, on which I would like people to pay more attention, for example CREDITS, EOS, NEO. Bitcoin and Ethereum may be the biggest coins now, but there are hundreds of coins which can achieve similar or even better rates of return. The decentralization of cryptocurrencies democratizes traditional powers and empowers the masses. No more shall you depend on financial institutions for transferring money that comes with an exorbitant fee. There are many coins – most notably Bitcoin – that allows users to transfer money to anyone at any location with a fraction of the fees. Not only that, having private wallets to store your coins gives you full control of your money. It’s like managing your own bank; you decide your own rules. Each coin has a specific purpose or solves a particular issue. For example CREDITS solve the problem of speed transactions as their speed is about 1mln tps.
