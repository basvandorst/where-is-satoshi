Great to hear, Smart contracts are exciting, but it's going to take a lot of time to test and validate not only the approaches to solving the halting problem, but also the implementations.  Since DATT only requires the payment layer, sticking with payment channels makes a lot of sense – though I wonder how far into "Layer 2" you'll end up. :)
That being said, if you want to play with smart contracts and stay within the Bitcoin ecosystem, check out what Rootstock is doing with sidechains!  They're [deploying Ethereum contracts to a Bitcoin-backed sidechain](  That's exactly the kind of experimentation we're hoping to see!

Sidechains are already here.  [The Alpha sidechain]( which includes [several interesting new features]( like Confidential Transactions, has been available for developer use since last June (2015).  Many people have been using the `alpha` network for testing and prototyping since then.  The code for Segregated Witness would not have been ready for proposing in Bitcoin without having previously been tested in Alpha – so to me, it seems sidechains are already in-use and productive for the community.
We're excited to see this becoming a community-driven effort, rather than one dependent on a single group – a successful Bitcoin ecosystem also means a diverse one.  In fact, others in the community have started creating their own sidechains (see comment!), including our friends at Rootstock, who are doing fantastic work.  There's a lot to be considered when designing a "meta-architecture" like this, so it'd be great to have more people working on and using them for research.
If you want to [start your own sidechain]( just follow the guide and get started.  The guide itself could use some love, so feel free to make recommendations!

Layer 3 is state management for distributed computations, with an operating system-like interface for standalone applications which may or may not be dependent on an anchor chain.  Layer 2 is mostly messaging (payments, in this case), while Layer 3 is a robust protocol for establishing and executing agreements.
After working at both Blockstream and BitPay, I became convinced that someone needed to build this kind of application layer for Bitcoin, so I started [Fabric](  We've making steady progress since the summer and are testing our `playnet` already!  150,000 users and counting.  ��

Well said, AnalyzerX7.  More important than anything is communication and understanding, as there are so many different ways to scale the Bitcoin protocol.  Many are delicately nuanced, and difficult to understand completely — we need to focus on helping others see the trade-offs of each of them, not just block size increases.

Security is of the utmost priority for BitPay, and we take these types of reports extremely seriously.
As you mention, we build and maintain a large number of [mostly open-source] software projects, so providing a comprehensive policy across all of these projects presents some unique challenges.  We have been taking extra care to collect feedback and work on a case-by-case basis before announcing a formal policy, one that we hope will be adequately rewarding for security researchers.
In the meantime, security issues with all BitPay projects should be reported to our security task force at security – we will make sure that all security issues are handled appropriately.

Payment channels are a way to sent many small payments without broadcasting many transactions (thus avoiding what would otherwise be hefty transaction fees).
Essentially, rather than creating new transactions for each payment, you create _one_ transaction (a contract) and then update it (re-sign) with each [micro]payment, and only when you're done do you broadcast the completed transaction to the network.
@_date: 2014-11-18 05:01:58
Eventually, payment processing will be decentralized, too – driving the cost to zero _anyways_.  There are other things in much more need of being decentralized in the meantime.

Hey Andy, Eric from BitPay here.  This is great work!
This is a _perfect_ use case for a [payment channel]( which allows metering of the fluid in any amount (instead of a pre-determined one).  It's a clever arrangement of transactions that lets you lock up a maximum amount of value, meter out your service (fluid, in this case), and only upon the completion of the exchange broadcast the resulting value exchange.

We've already [implemented support for the payment protocol]( and we're starting to see more wallets support it directly.  Once it's supported by the majority, and payment channel implementations have sufficiently advanced, we'll see a proposal to include them in the payment protocol as well.

Altcoins serve a very clear purpose; to provide the strongest blockchain with a low-risk iterative cycle:
1. **Innovate.**  Test some new idea.  New consensus method, different economics, etc.
2. **Validate.** Does it work?  Is the hypothesis tested by this new "coin" correct?
3. **Integrate.** Learn from the implications of the now proven hypothesis, and integrate those changes into the parent chain.
The strongest blockchain today is Bitcoin, as it was the first to achieve the network effect necessary to cross the chasm between great idea and public awareness.  It is unlikely that any other blockchain-based token will succeed it without some extraordinary event or change.

In the current implementation, nonces are limited in scope to the client  – which we view as analogous to a single server, or a single process.  In addition to preventing replay attacks, they are used to _enforce_ sequence of operations for that process.
For the distributed environments we've been working with, new processes create a new keypair so they can be uniquely identified and protected against these replay attacks.

Eric from BitPay here.  This allows zero-confirmation payments to be secured using standard Bitcoin transactions – no more waiting for block confirmations to be sure of an individual transaction's validity.
This is done via a clever arrangement of transactions into a type of smart contract called a "payment channel", which is then used as a sort of "substrate" for future payment arrangements.
We'll be releasing a formalized whitepaper after an initial feedback period on the protocol specification.

Eric with BitPay here – great work on putting this summary together.  It looks great.
We're still trying to solve the trust problem.  We've seen some proposals, but no clear solution has emerged.  Before we move to adopt such a protocol, we'd like to see more community feedback and ideas on how we can reduce or even eliminate the need for trust...

Agreed on the importance of Payment Protocol.  I'd like to see support for it in _all_ wallets by the end of 2015.

I'll second this, Mark.  From a consumer adoption perspective, user experience is the thing that matters most.  If the Bitcoin payment experience isn't significantly better than existing payment solutions (including both cash and credit), then it will never gain adoption among consumers.
There is great work being done by my former co-workers at BitPay on [the Copay wallet]( and the AirBitz team on [the AirBitz wallet](  They both have their benefits (and are both lacking in some areas), but they're among the best payment experiences available.
Some wishlist items for user experience with the Bitcoin consumer payment experience:
- strong privacy features, via some combination of [Confidential Transactions]( and CoinJoin.
- some form of "zero-confirmation" payment system, like [Impulse]( or [the Lightning Network](
- a complete elimination of QR Codes, perhaps via Bluetooth
- a deep integration with known merchant lists to discover _where_ Bitcoin payments can be made
- better guidance for setting up proper multi-signature security, including integration with third-party signing authorities, and multi-device setups
Once the payment experience can be made trustless, private, and convenient for everyone, Bitcoin will win the consumer adoption phase.

I've been called a conspiracy theorist my whole life, and the strange false dichotomy of "big blockers vs. small blockers" is no exception.  If people aren't paying attention to the leaks (Snowden, Panama, Vault7, ...), then I fear we have only ourselves to blame for the apathy shown by the public.

It's an economic incentive, just the same.  I made this argument to while we were at BitPay, but it turns out there are more forms of capital than monetary.  Bitcoin's security is its value, and running a full node increases that security.

Yes, but not financial networks.  Finance is one of those things that, historically, if something seems broken, you shut it down until you find the source of the problem.  With Bitcoin, this is no longer the case, as the network is incentivized as a whole to ensure forward progress.

Although, lines of code isn't a great metric.  Code adds complexity, so it really should be lines _spent_... number of commits isn't much better, either.

Hey thanks for the Pirate Party lapel pin you gave me a couple years back in Amsterdam.  I still wear it proudly every time I'm forced into a suit.
Commentary from experienced public figures such as yourself is under-appreciated and otherwise under-represented in the Bitcoin community.  We have a long way to come before we fix the world of finance, and the acknowledgement of the social component of this socio-technical system is a good next step towards getting there.
Keep calm and Bitcoin on.

Yeah, "down" isn't the right word here.  We're talking about a distributed system with no central point of reference outside of the blockchain, which only makes discrete progress (once every 10 minutes or so).

Great feedback.  Thanks.
I agree that a lot of things have had the word "blockchain" slapped on them lately in pursuit of hype, but I don't think that a decentralized Reddit requires a blockchain.  It might require a digital currency, but not necessarily a dedicated blockchain.
I definitely agree with the federation component.  I also think it needs to be web-based, which is where the otherwise fantastic Aether fails for me.  I do think the ID system should be similar to Tox, in that you have a unique public key hash that represents you, but this is largely unfriendly – usernames are more friendly, but maybe they can just be aliases (both suggested and local!).
@_date: 2016-12-22 03:22:36
Agreed!  I wish a lot more content were open-source so changes like this could be more easily made.

Thanks!  This an incredibly comprehensive response.
I don't think a complex system will work, actually.  I think there must exist a simple, and elegant model that incorporates all of these aspects, or at least the underlying motives they represent.
I do think you're hitting on something very powerful, which is one of the original suggestions for micropayments and even Bitcoin specifically – spam reduction.  By charging a very small amount to broadcast content, you can drastically increase the cost for those who want to spam _en masse_, while making the cost negligible for those producing valuable or otherwise legitimate contributions.
I don't think ads have a place in this new system.  Certainly not traditional display advertising.  Perhaps a new model will emerge here.
"Reddit Gold" isn't something that directly translates, I don't think, but it's an interesting concept.  I almost view it as competing for the same space with something like monetary tipping – which might be why Reddit ultimately canned their project, quite frankly.
I'm curious if there's new ideas you might want to see implemented, that Reddit doesn't currently.

Implementation cruft.  SegWit was cleverly changed from a hard fork into a soft fork, allowing easy adoption, but other changes might be desirable to deploy similarly, or perhaps even as a 1:1 pegged sidechain that implements the breaking change.

From the paper:










@_date: 2017-10-30 23:01:03
It's (most likely) being implemented in [Elements]( first, like Segregated Witness was.  If it withstands peer review and proves itself practical, it'll be proposed to the Bitcoin mailing list and maybe even become a BIP.  
Fortunately it looks like this is a soft-forkable change, so enabling it on Bitcoin itself should be a smooth process.  I've said the same thing a few times before, though...

Agree.  Two strokes as the formal, single stroke as an informal (much like the $ symbol).

Liquid _is_ built with the Elements code, but there's a lot more to a working federated sidechain than just the code.
There are indeed a few minor additions we've made to make the whole thing work, but we hope these can be upstreamed into Elements, or otherwise open sourced.  These changes are mostly related to managing consensus in a production network, of which very little code exists to date.
The hardware and setup procedures aren't as easily open-sourced, but they should be coming out in the whitepaper.

@_date: 2015-03-12 22:04:05
No.  Unlike Bitcoin, a database does not necessarily need state consistency, and may even have a need to rewind, fork, and prune multiple versions at once.  Trees can be branch and utilized selectively, and even utilize filtering to preserve a smaller set of nodes.  Sidechains shouldn't require additional proofs of work.
That being said, Proof of Fees is only one type of consensus in ChainDB.  We will provide more details later.
@_date: 2015-03-04 03:10:39
This is the same code, de-coupled from Copay, so it can be more readily integrated into other projects.

Thanks for sharing your thoughts! It's always good to hear well-formed opinions like this. I don't think politics necessarily has anything to do with it, many parameters were chosen to model natural law (gold mining, etc.).
I do think even the most staunch individualist can be convinced that the better long-term strategy is to invest in those around you, so long as it isn't compulsory. Coalitions will always exist: it is over their monopoly (geographic, in most) that conflict arises.

**Disclaimer**: I work at BitPay, which builds Copay.
I've switched most of my funds over to multi-sig wallets powered by [Copay][copay].  It's extremely easy to set up a local install, and then configure a 2-of-3 for basic 2-factor auth (the third key being a backup).  Copay having builds for pretty much everything also means that I've got the same, familiar interface on all of my devices.
Copay also allows for asynchronous transaction proposals; which means that you don't have to wait for all parties in the wallet to be online.  Useful for managing funds across a team of people.
Best of all, I can have a version of Copay that uses the full blockchain as my "master node" by running my own version of [Insight][insight], so I don't have to trust any outside nodes.

@_date: 2015-03-02 00:09:02
Yes.  Only truly valuable if you generate the three keys on different devices, using different networks.

We're all looking forward to an implementation of this!  I've just added [Copay issue  so we can track progress towards CoinJoin.

Agreed!  We've got these features on the roadmap, but there are several other items above them in priority.

@_date: 2015-11-02 21:47:25
Not Liquid necessarily, but anyone using the same code (called "Confidential Transactions") from the Elements Project gets this feature.  CoinJoin is a bit different, but it or something like it can easily be built today using sidechains or other blockchains.
@_date: 2015-03-01 21:16:48
Yes!  We're very excited for this one.  It's being tracked on [Copay issue 
@_date: 2015-03-03 17:41:36
Asynchronous transaction proposals; when there are multiple signatories, you don't want them all to have to be online at the same time.
@_date: 2015-03-01 21:15:09
Nothing.  The Insight server cannot view anything about the transaction proposals, as they are encrypted such that only the ring participants can decrypt them.

Congrats to my former teammates!  Really glad to finally see this out the door.  What is the official maintenance path for `libbitcoind` as downloaded via [this binary](  I can't seem to find source code or documentation on how Bitcoin Core has been modified for use in Bitcore, which might be useful for a number of other ongoing endeavors.
PS, particularly great work by who, as far as I know, did most of the modifications to Bitcoin Core that made this possible.

It doesn't, and it shouldn't.  Competition is important, it is what drives innovation and improvements.  Either Bitcoin will continue to improve, or something better will eventually take its place.
What Bitcoin _has_ done is achieved a network effect that will be very difficult to repeat, and anything intending to take its place will require significant improvements to overtake it.  For some, this makes Bitcoin an attractive bet – for others, an incentive for invention.
@_date: 2015-02-16 02:01:49
Upvote for what _could_ be a cleverly constructed question designed to point out the irrelevance of "property rights" when it relates to something intangible or otherwise infinitely replicable.
Bitcoin are a new asset class in that they don't exist in one place, but rather the _rights to move them_ is secured by the obscurity of a special number, the "private key".  Bitcoin are _only_ valuable through the scarcity of the private key required to re-associate them with another, _new_ private key.
Private keys become valuable in that they are almost infinitely unique, and a unique private key is required to hold or move Bitcoin – by extension, the Bitcoin are valuable.

It's not circumventing any user-specific limitations, only retrying the purchase of the BitCoins until there are some made available.  Coinbase's 24-hour platform-wide rolling limit effectively causes the same behavior via their UI (retry until success), I'm just automating this.

Hey Fred, wondering if you could weigh in on the impact this will have on my [Coinbase Trader application]( which automatically retries orders using the Coinbase API until they are filled.
