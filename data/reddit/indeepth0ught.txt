You can see video clips of internet paranoia in the 90's too. People react negatively to what they don't know or don't understand. In addition to that they read some people became millionaires because they bought a lot of bitcoin early. This makes people feel jealous or makes this whole thing feel like a scam. Right now bitcoin is (pretty much) only used by an incredibly small number of interested geeks and it's very easy for majority of people to hate on this small group.

This type of post is why everyone makes fun of this subreddit.
@_date: 2015-06-28 15:31:05
It looks like it can be used this way too.

Bears have been winning so hard and for so long there is no pain at all. 
@_date: 2015-06-16 17:52:26
Are we seriously doing this again? Oh god. 
@_date: 2015-06-17 23:04:06
Most bitcoiners weren't apple users to begin with. 
@_date: 2015-01-14 03:50:18
Not if you're counting in real money lost.
@_date: 2015-01-07 02:31:07
Yeah this is what was said 24 hours ago.
@_date: 2015-01-14 14:18:25
You actually did it, I'm impressed. Kudos, unfortunately I sold all my doges and bitcoins a while ago to tip you.
@_date: 2015-01-13 23:34:04
It's fake.
@_date: 2015-01-13 23:33:06
It's fake.

Internet honor? This ACCOUNT WAS created an hour ago.
@_date: 2015-01-14 00:50:32
True, but in some cases men are a bit more "free" from it because men's social groups are not as tight and rigid. 
@_date: 2015-01-04 01:05:53
That is one tiny life savings. 
@_date: 2015-01-14 02:04:20
Godspeed. 
@_date: 2015-01-13 15:23:03
You do realize bitcoin is a currency not an investment? It's meant for USE. 
@_date: 2015-01-13 02:07:52
I would be more impressed if you did something useful like I dunno, actually teach her how to do it herself? Most likely she's not interested. 
@_date: 2015-01-05 14:54:15
FUDalicious. 
@_date: 2015-01-13 01:42:18
What a really terrible analogy. Only fucking pro-gun fuckers who try to use everything in the universe to push their pro-gun shit believe this.
@_date: 2015-01-13 05:50:14
Why would i buy any? What guarantee is there that it will ever go back up?
@_date: 2015-01-13 23:37:03
I think it's fake and there are much easier ways of faking these convos. As I said, good job buttcoin. I ought to become one of you now because I'm disgusted how stupid this community is. 
@_date: 2015-01-13 14:55:52
They still don't have a dollar though. They have a small fraction of a bitcoin and have to jump through hoops to get it exchanged for a usable dollar. Not many things you can buy online with a dollar's worth of bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-01-15 02:52:13
Is this on yet?
@_date: 2015-01-15 02:55:09
Why not just do it now dumbshit? If you assume bitcoin is going to skyrocket to infinity and beyond then what's another hundred bucks per coin?
@_date: 2015-01-13 14:54:13
Not sure. It works for it's intended reason just fine. Just because early adopters got rich quick doesn't mean it's a scam. Let's say that satoshi nakamoto literally intended it to scam people and make a shit ton of money (I don't actually believe this). If it ends up working as a currency and people like it is it STILL really a scam?
@_date: 2015-01-13 05:54:04
The price is low but the concept works just fine.
@_date: 2015-01-13 23:45:40
Most of them are not very intelligent. I think they absolutely have potential but it's not "cool" to be smart or have interests in anything other than what the mainstream says is OK. 
@_date: 2015-01-04 01:29:52
It's being raided by buttcoiners. They're getting directly linked to here. 
@_date: 2015-01-13 05:58:12
Ill bite. How is it a scam? Do you know what a scam is?
@_date: 2015-01-13 05:52:41
Lemmings, likw the lemmings who thought bitcoin would hit the moon except it slowly dropped over the course of the year?
@_date: 2015-01-09 21:38:09
Nope, looks like you were wrong.
@_date: 2015-01-14 00:52:10
I'm not saying that's THE ONLY reason, but it sure does look suspicious. So does his fucking impossible to memorize throwaway username. Doesn't that look like an obviously throw away account to you?
@_date: 2015-01-13 23:33:19
It's fake.
@_date: 2015-01-14 02:47:38
Not smart, just this subreddit is stupid. That's a clear fact.
@_date: 2015-01-13 14:42:16
What you just described shows it's not working. You can never know when it's going to go up or down and always rish losing tons of money due to volatility when using bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-01-13 23:31:40
Its fake though. Your account is brand new. I can't believe people fell for this.. Good job buttcoin. 
@_date: 2015-01-14 04:08:12
I thought so.
@_date: 2015-01-13 23:32:59
It's fake.
@_date: 2015-01-15 02:57:42
Who even is this Jack McBrayer looking fucker?
@_date: 2015-01-13 05:51:10
Am i on buttcoin or bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-01-14 14:50:30
I didn't make any posts here, nor it my account that new even. He created a new account JUST to make this post.
@_date: 2015-01-13 23:29:00
This is the fakest thing on the internet. LMAO how stupid this fucking subreddit is for falling for it.
@_date: 2015-01-14 03:49:21
So how much money have you made from the jubjub thing so far?
@_date: 2015-01-13 14:59:59




Double LOL.
@_date: 2015-01-07 05:20:59
I wouldn't jump to that conclusion so quickly. If they have their coins in cold storage then they're fine. 
@_date: 2015-01-14 00:09:08
Basically yes, that's usually how people post fake content on reddit. 
@_date: 2016-06-12 11:39:02
Don't let it sink in because it's complete bullshit. 
@_date: 2016-06-12 12:32:29
The difference is that some could feasibly want to buy twitter. All of it. Companies get bought and sold all the time. This is not the same case with bitcoin, the situation is just not analogous at all. 
@_date: 2016-06-12 13:12:30
That's all I was saying so it seems we agree. 
@_date: 2016-06-12 11:55:43
If you start selling off bitcoin the price would drop rapidly. The actual market cap is not 10 billion. 
@_date: 2015-07-08 14:22:09
Yikes, punk rock is dead now. Not a really good comparison. 
@_date: 2015-07-09 15:40:53
Even if amazon did take bitcoin nothing good would come out of it because no one buys stuff with bitcoin enough for it to be relevant. 
@_date: 2015-07-09 16:45:44
I'm well aware. 
@_date: 2015-02-27 16:59:51
He's doing this because he is extremely religious and is known for spamming idiotic religious bullshit into the blockchain. Why do people let a religious zelot idiot do important technical things i dont know. Just stick to reading your irrelevant book of bullshit and let normal people do this.
@_date: 2015-02-03 17:00:55
God damn it still looks so bad.
@_date: 2015-02-03 23:59:38
Wow when I read about it I immediately though how could anyone be fucking absolutely stupid enough to fall for it. Turns out you're one of those people.

Let's not go overboard now. Let the new generation of 13 year olds play this terrible game.
