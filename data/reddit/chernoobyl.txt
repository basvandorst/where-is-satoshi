3 homes got robbed just in my neighborhood last month, we set up a neighborhood watch and have been having meetings with everyone in the area. Lots of places are pretty messed up, the warnings here are certainly valid.

Uhhhh yes it 100% will produce a cloud like that

To be fair, if you have THAT many people telling you things about it maybe you should heed the advice here and just keeps it quiet.

A lot of people remove many things like family financial support, education, seed money from savings..etc. It's still good to listen to those who are successful, but absolutely things are left off the ticket and it's sometimes daunting comparing to your own situation since you know all the specifics about yours and none of theirs.

I may take you up on this offer if I can. I'm in my early 30's and am going no where really, I have a small workshop and would love to generate a little business to help save for paying off debt and buying a home.

I just put my first little bit in. $150 on Coinbase. I've been putting it off for a while, I'm sick of my shitty poor paycheck to paycheck life. I need this beacon of hope, even if it fails I just need some hope that life can get better.

too bad they can't confiscate reposts

I'm doing my part!
@_date: 2019-01-07 23:48:01
Yes, because that's how reality works. 
@_date: 2019-01-08 22:28:04
Sounds like quit bitcoin, not quit smoking
@_date: 2017-05-02 15:04:12
As a human, I too think this way. I'm sure we all do, because we are all human here.

Well damn, I'd pay for some too. Also be safe there bro, seen some crazy videos the last couple days out there.
