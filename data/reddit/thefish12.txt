You and I just disagree philosophically here. 
Tax evasion should not be encouraged.

While I agree with you... Bitcoins are not safe from the government considering you have to pay taxes on any gains (if you're in the US)

Sorry for wanting to live in a society

No I didn't mean "the feds would like you to".  I meant you "legally HAVE to".  Just like you HAVE to pay child support if the court orders it. And you HAVE to pay your employees. 
Evading taxes is illegal.

So you think, when I used the word "have", that I meant the undeniable laws of the universe compel you to pay taxes on gains? Or are you just being pedantic?

If you're defining taxes as "legalized theft" then yes it does.  Society does require taxes.

I used "have" in the colloquial sense to mean "are legally required to".

First of all, it's not legalized theft. It isn't theft at all. The government isn't stealing. It has a set of rules that you need to abide by. One of those rules says: if you use our society to make money, some of that money goes back to the society. Don't like it? Leave, expatriate, or never make any money. 
And yes, society does require taxes. How would you recommend we run things without any taxes? Just ask nicely when a road or airport or police force or army or school needs money?

I do, and I have for a while, and I pay taxes on my gains. 
I'm not going to risk jail time for 15% of my gains.
