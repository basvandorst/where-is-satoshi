I’m waiting for his fart so I can buy some crypto on the extreme cheap.

To put it another way...much like the US dollar can be divided into its smallest unit of 100 cents (or 100 pennies), one BTC can be divided into its smallest unit of 100,000,000 satoshis or sats (for short).

He’ll tell you he remembered reading in 2008 that 1 BTC is equal to 100,000,000 satoshis...after he wrote it. :)

It means you need to move the coins over to a wallet (preferably an offline wallet or better yet a hardware wallet such as Nano X or Trezor) that only you have access to the keys to access the wallet. Leaving your coins on any exchange runs the risk of them being hacked and your coins get stolen or the exchange pulls an exit scam and you lose your coins.

For sure I am one of those.

Is there a professional lawyer among us who can answer this question from a legal perspective? WoW gold versus BTC and the WoW ToS.

If you can, use Coinbase Pro (not the Coinbase Phone app). Bought $1000 worth of BTC under a limit order and paid $1.50 only in fees.
