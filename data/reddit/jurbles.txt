Bitcoin has a first-mover advantage when we consider all digital currencies. This first-mover advantage affords it stronger network security (more miners). No altcoin has comparable network security and unless something disrupts Bitcoin violently, this will not change. Low network security means attacks on the network are more likely, hence this is one reason why alts are bad.

Hilarious. I feel like unironically supporting this satirical website, if only I could find an address.

Also, the argument that altcoins are competitive to bitcoin doesn't hold water. The value of altcoins are directly pegged to the value of bitcoin. To be successful, Bitcoin must compete against 180 fiat currencies. Another infinity of currencies in the form of arbitrary altcoins hamper Bitcoin's competition against the fiat currencies and hence hamper every altcoin's success. 
Altcoins are clambering over each other for what they perceive to be the last seat to the moon. What they don't realize is that they're making the ship too heavy to escape gravity. 
It's pure greed, really. Bitcoin is gold that was struck and now people are riding into town claiming graphite is the next gold, trying to pitch people to buy into graphite when graphite is clearly ingenuine and shitty. Not to mention that the people peddling graphite are known scammers or similar peddlers have scammed in the past. 
Let them argue that altcoin x is better than bitcoin for y reasons. Great! We can test it in a Bitcoin-backed sidechain environment in 5 years and if a consensus of the Bitcoin network truly believes y is a desirable network feature, then let y be implemented. The point is that the act of creating new coins has been made completely obsolete with the advent of sidechains.
The most appropriate time to compete and the altcoin, if any, I think has best opportunity to being the bitcoin-alternative is the one that is first to be born on the moon. Anything else is dead weight.
