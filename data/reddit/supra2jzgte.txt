This wasn’t the only spot where people casted doubt bitcoin would ever hit 10k a coin.
I remember four years ago reading about that possibility and thinking to myself “oh please”
I am eating my words right now.

I am kicking myself every time a post like this pops up!  Sold at 200$ ������
@_date: 2017-06-18 01:24:40
No that's pretty much how it always is in the world of  BTC.
@_date: 2017-06-04 02:13:28
This is true.
@_date: 2013-07-04 14:12:38
They never emailed me a .json file.  I save every email from them as well.  :(
@_date: 2013-07-02 21:59:28
Did Blockchain ever reset this?  I just had the same issue occur to me and am still waiting to hear back from them.
