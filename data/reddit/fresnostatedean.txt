You don't \_need\_ to do anything. Matthew.
The purpose of these tipping apps is to make tipping affordable by leveraging the lightning network. On-chain fees would make it not worth the money. And above all, user-friendliness. If that's of no concern to you, you can go through the hassle of generating me a LN invoice for 100 sat and I'll be happy to fill it.
But again, you don't \_need\_ to do anything. Matthew.

You pass them on to someone else ;)
Leveraging the lightning network in the sense that the fees are negligibly small. You wouldn't be able to make such small transactions on-chain as the miner fee would basically kill you. 
Of course, if you look into it more closely, the transaction from my Bottle wallet to your Bottle wallet does not actually involve a lightning transaction, it's just an internal adjustment of respective balances. However, you can easily transfer the money from your Bottle Wallet to any other Lightning Network-enabled wallet, in which case, under the hood, a lightning channel will be set up and an actual Lightning Network transaction will take place. I tried it and it worked just fine.

Yes, bottle is a custodial wallet, as far as i know myself.
Yes, you can transfer whatever you have in bottle to your own wallets, as long as they support Ligntning Network. For electrum that seems to be the case in their next release ([ So you should wait a bit I guess.
Not sure why it didn't catch it before. Maybe the Reddit bot needs to have the ! command being stand alone? They also have Telegram and Twitter bots, and each time the syntax is slightly different.

It might work at the level of Bottle itself, because, as mentioned before, those are not true Lightning Network (LN) transfers. Just a readjustment of your Bottle balance and his Bottle balance. But, to do that, you'd first have to fill up your Bottle wallet with this much money... and that's where it would become problematic. Indeed, to fill up your wallet, you'd have to do a LN transfer from your own LN node or any other LN-enabled wallet (like Electrum in the near future). However, a LN transfer is something quite special (it might not look like it thanks to recent improvments in user-friendliness), but it is. I'd recommend reading up on it.
Yet, in a nutshell, the lightning network is an off-chain solution to resolve scaling issues inherent to Bitcoin (or any other cryptocurrency that might eventually support LN). Person A and person B both open a LN node and set up a channel between these two nodes. This channel has to be funded with a certain amount. This channel is off-chain. The blockhain does not know what is happening inside this channel until A and/or B decides to close the channel and settle the balance on-chain. Until this happens, A and B can balance and rebalance their channel ledgers up and down, thus effectively transferring funds to one and another. Almost no fees are involved in this, thus making it nearly free. It's only when you put it back on-chain that you pay the miner fee. In reality, to go from A to B, you could actually hop over the network from A to C to D to E to B. You don't need a direct channel. Hence the "lightning network". FYI, the small fees you might still encounter is because C, D and E might ask for this to help you hop all the way to B. In theory, this should scall down to negligible fees of the order of a couple of satoshi.
Now, because in each channel funds are basically locked up, one usually does not want to lock up too much. 350 dollar is a lot. So, unless you make a direct channel from A to B, it would be very unlikely to find an hopping path where C, D and E all have 350 dollar locked up in their channels. I think the present status of the network has a high probability of finding a path with sufficient funds for a couple of dollars. For larger amounts it will probably fail. Having 350 dollar locked up between A and B would only make sense if you and your friend want to send money to one another regularly back-and-forth (not just one way). Otherwise, settling it on-chain directly would be the most sensible solution.
Again, it's probably not super accurate what I wrote here, so best thing would be to read up on it by some LN experts.
Thanks for asking these questions. Let me empty my Bottle wallet for you:
