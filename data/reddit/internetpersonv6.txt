I started out with dogecoin, moved to litecoin, and finally bitcoin.  You can certainly get involved in whatever you want, but in the end you'll come back to the most commonly traded coin that people use.

Maybe stop trading for a while so things go back up in value?

Damn that meme template got used fast.  I approve of this one though.

Hi goatpig,
I use armory to store my bitcoin.  In the event of a fork and assuming armory now supports both chains, will I simply have to update my armory wallet to the latest revision in order to take advantage of both chains? Will there be an upgrade guide for novice users like myself?

And to elaborate on your point, I guess after reviewing what BITCF actually does and looking over their exchange... it wasn't that impressive.  For example if you look at coinmarketcap.com and just look at Bitcoin's markets, where is CoinQX, BITCF's exchange? It's not even listed.  You also can't even see the exchange rate, buy or sell orders, etc. like you would on any of the other big exchanges.
I guess for a company that is focused so heavily on their exchange and other technologies I was wondering why they weren't listed.

I don't understand how transactions can be so expensive.  I've never paid more than $1 for a transaction... but then I have less than 10 BTC.
@_date: 2017-08-14 22:13:31
Oh haha I forgot I made this post.  I made about $4k off of BITCF and  then sunk it all into SING.  Fingers crossed it breaks the $1.00 mark.

I hope you pulled your money out before the SEC halted trading.  Scheduled to lift 9/7/2017.

Just a heads up, it's never good to ask for advice from internet strangers when it comes to investing.  Do your homework or you may regret your decisions later.
That said, it's my opinion that the actual coin will continue to rise in price.  People are taking note of this in the stock market and everyone wants to "get in" on Bitcoin's gains without owning the coin itself (or they are not technical enough to understand how to own it).  On the stock market side of things, it seems easy to exploit the ignorance of the common investor and "ride the wave" upward as these penny stocks shoot to the moon.  As always with any investment, consider whether you are ok with losing the money you invest before you make the trade.  If you aren't, than you shouldn't.

You can't trade BITCF until 9/7/2017 according to the SEC statement.  If you're holding it, I'm sorry.

Wow.  This is insane.  Talk about regret...

Funny thing is I bought $30 worth of reddit gold in bitcoin a year ago.  As long as you pay a high transaction fee to get it confirmed asap, everything works fine.  Hence me reaching out to gold support... which has not responded to me even acknowledging an issue.
