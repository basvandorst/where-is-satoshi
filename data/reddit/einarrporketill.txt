I was just thinking this. I'm sitting here laughing at memes about how I'm losing hundreds of thousands of dollars in the matter of days.

It's a joke about checks

What does this tell you about our democracy that we assume that the lawmakers did not intend for that?

This. Especially if you owe them money. I hope OP has extra money to pay him back if the price tanks hard or he loses his coins somehow.

That's the mistake my dad told me to make when it hit $10000. Every time Bitcoin bursts, it comes back stronger than ever. Bitcoin continues to gain users and notoriety even when the price crashes.

I'm not saying anybody **should** believe in bitcoin. I'm just saying that if they are going to invest in something, they better understand it.
I don't blindly believe in Bitcoin in particular; it's only 24% of my portfolio. I believe in the power of a decentralized ledger to reduce the centralization of power in many sectors, not just money. I'm invested in some other cryptocurrencies that may become the most popular ones for day-to-day transactions. The only significance of Bitcoin is that it's the first, but I think that will help it stay valuable even if it isn't very useful (like how gold is valuable because it's rare and humans placed a significance on it).

I'm sure it was requested more than segwit, considering how many people had BTC on Coinbase/GDAX during the fork and wanted access to their BCH.

You seem a little bitter. I'm sorry for your loss. 
And it has nothing to do with being financially savvy. It mostly just having to do with **knowing what you invested in and actually believing in it** instead of just trying to get rich quick. I think that's something that deserves being made fun of.

This really can't be understated. This world would be a much better place if people were allowed to take psychedelics (at least in a therapeutic setting) to cure their neurotic behaviors (addiction, anger, anxiety, etc). I even think they are crucial for saving the human race from destroying itself.

This makes the name "Blockstream" really fit here.

Why do you act like they have to go all in on crypto or not have any at all? It would be stupid not to own any crypto imo.

That'll be easy when he makes Bircoin and it only has 1 BRC in circulation.

Bitcoin is known to be one of the most volatile and risky investments you can make right now, yet you say:


Since these large 50% drops you talk of never occur, can't we call the 20% drops "large"?

You should be able to live off of ~$1.5M worth of investments quite easy. The closer your cryptocurrency portfolio gets to that, the more you should be diversifying into less volatile/risky traditional investment assets.

Seems like this will negatively effect the rich more than the poor, so I doubt it will pass.
