I meant in the second step. But I deleted the message anyway because the scheme fails on the first step. See my other reply.

tl;dr In a free market, the typical dis-economy of scale generally comes from a difficulty in adapting to changing market conditions. This does not apply to mining.
Why do firms form in the first place? Why are their companies (of any size) rather than just individuals trading their services in an open market?
Ronald Coase provided an answer to that question: firms form to lower transaction costs. If you ran a restaurant and needed to go bid for a waiter on the waiter market every day, you would incur significant transaction costs over time.
Large firms generally follow an established pattern, they know what good and services they need and internalize those costs as much as possible. This, along with physical advantages, is the reason why there are economies of scale.
But they are also dis-economies of scale. By internalizing many services, the firm destroys important market signals. Its economies of scale only last as long as external conditions do not change too much. Smaller, more adaptable and more innovative companies end up competing with these large companies.
This is all great, but it's bad news for Bitcoin mining. There is a very clear scale advantage (variance reduction) but no dis-economy of scale. Worse, since mining competition is 0 sum, the bigger one miner becomes, the worse the situation for the other miners. There could be some ASIC innovation, but nothing that a large miner couldn't jump on board with.

Well no, if you have 50% of the coin, then so does the rest of the network, so by symmetry you can always break the chain. But I get your point.

The debt does counterbalance the effect, but there is still a permanent (but bounded) expansion of the money supply that leads to price inflation. Think of it this way, before you only had bitcoin, after you have bitcoins competing with a very good substitute which is a bank note representing a debt of one bitcoin. The existence of this substitute lowers the demand for bitcoin and thus their purchasing power.
Borrowers borrow in banknotes, thus they increase the demand, but only a little bit.
The same effect will come out of any fast transaction system. The Ripple network (or some equivalent) for example will increase the velocity of money a lot, leading to inflation.
 Fortunately, all of this is a "one off". It's great to increase money velocity, but it's something to be warry off when kneading in bitcoin for its appreciation.

I am talking about N
@_date: 2014-06-19 16:50:09
1. Yes, you build your own chain, alone. Say you control 1% of the coins,  and assume 50% PoS participation. It'll take you 50 times longer to build your chain than the main chain (assuming 100% participation...). Your paper suggests that entropy is accumulated over a period of 459 * 5 minutes = 1 day, 14 hours and 15 minutes. So after about 2 months and half you're in control of the entropy and you're producing blocks twice as fast as the real chain. Another 5 months and you've caught up with the chain. The attack takes 7 months and a half. Of course, you can do better than that. You can purchase a large stake (say 10%), start your fork, then sell your stake on the main chain. This costs you nothing and allows you to build your double spending fork 10 times faster. 
@_date: 2014-06-19 16:52:20
2. So a double signer will wait until his coins have been unlocked to start a fork going way back. Are you checkpointing or cemtenting?
3. Censorship is possible if blocks decide to ignore the previous block and attach to older blocks. You mention this possibility but only consider stealing transaction fees as a motive. Censorship can be another motive, and it's harder to mitigate.
For instance, say the next blocks are assigned to miners B,A,A,C (A got picked twice). Say the last block was mined by X.
So at first we get [X]-[B], but then, A attaches itself to X, not B, like this
Now [C] comes along, and he attaches itself to [X]-[A]-[A], not [X]-[B] because that's the longest chain. A has successfully censored block B.
By the way, I shot you an email, would love to talk to you in private.
@_date: 2014-06-19 19:39:12
Note quite the same thing. Yes, you could use any value for the inner hash, but what would be the point? There is however a point in *not* including B, which would be to use a mining pool (albeit one would run out of money quickly)
@_date: 2014-06-19 21:42:00
You do not need to do these calculations. If you know exactly what the random seed will be in the future (because you control it), you can strategically move your coins ahead of time to outputs which are going to be hit
@_date: 2014-06-13 15:46:25
Another, far more depressing, theory is that people join mining pool because of a psychological / economic bias which leads them to believe that they're getting "free" coins that way.
It's unbelievably stupid, but I've heard many people (including otherwise smart people) say: oh yeah, I don't want to buy bitcoins, but I was thinking about mining them.
These are the people on cex.io which provides a large share of ghash's power. There will still be a cex.io, even if proof of blockchain storage is introduced.

1/ How do you prevent a stakeholder to form an alternate chain which starts puny but where he ends up controlling all of the entropy?
2/ How do you punish a double signer that has since cashed out?
@_date: 2014-02-12 15:36:07
The amount of transaction fees spent in the network demands solely on the demand for transaction (the supply is fixed). This demand will become very low as an efficient network of payment provider arise (those providers maintain IOU with each other and clear once in a while).
This is a good thing, it means that everyone is getting safe, instantaneous transaction but with a fallback that guarantees competitivity in the space.
However, it also means that the amount collected by miners will be low, and completely disconnected from the overall value of the whole economy. This makes 51% attack more and more likely to happen as time goes by.
In the end, it's likely this will be solved by having miners sign blocks, which will break the decentralization of the network and pave the way for state control.
An alternative would be to start incorporating proof of stake mechanism, but that is very unlikely to happen given the current stance of the bitcoin foundation and the inertia of the current system.

And no, putting blockheader through an expensive hashing function isn't going to help either because pool participants could just download a torrent of different values of H(S+N),N from the miner and try them all against a given blockheader
@_date: 2014-06-19 17:07:41
It doesn't matter, the thing doesn't prevent pool mining! Pool members can fiddle with the block header until they find a valid hash.

Problem is, there is no presumption of innocence with the IRS. It's your responsibility to prove that you did not break the law.

This is why I mentioned cex.io specifically. These people want the economics of mining with the least amount of inconvenience. Perhaps what is needed is a peer to peer market place of mining contacts.
@_date: 2014-02-12 20:08:55
There are obvious benefits to anyone using this system, very cheap, instantaneous transaction. The trust required between the payment providers is something that can be acquired easily, by posting collateral in a multisignature wallet. Assuming bitcoin is successful, there is no reason for such a system *not* to arise.
So yes, it is an assumption, but to the same extent that "miners want to make money" is an assumption. It's microeconomics.

But he can grow his chain to belong longer and more powerful. He can catch up by mining every single block


What is the condition for confiscation? He can pull this off without ever double signing a block. Who's to say he just wasn't able to broadcast his blocks?
@_date: 2014-06-19 13:24:33
Here's the problem with this approach. A mining pool operator could hold S and N fixed, give SHA(S+N) and N to pool members and ask them to tweak the blockheader until they find hits.
@_date: 2014-06-20 15:39:24
But wait a minute, it's also hugely time consuming. In order to verify a block, you need to re-parse the entire blockchain? It's important that network nodes can verify block quickly before relaying them. This does not seem quick

The current spread on Bitstamp is 625.5, 625.57, about 1bps. However, they have a 20 bps transaction fee, so effectively it's 20 bps.

There are two nonces in this case, the one use for the secret and the one used in the block header. Even if you remove the nonce from the block header, you can still generate a lot of entropy by shuffling transactions. 
@_date: 2014-02-12 20:10:16
Actually, I explicitly say that it's not the only possible outcome. One other outcome is cartelization of the miners. It's not good either.
Most outcomes that do not involve changing the consensus systems look pretty grim to me.

How do you prove you put it in there? Sure if you didn't, you won't make money, but maybe you're just evil...

Not confusing with PPCoin, but I just "got" the value of "follow the satoshi" as opposed to "draw from txouts". It's very clever.

3/ How do you prevent censorship?
@_date: 2014-06-13 14:42:31
I'm under the impression that the primary reason people join mining pools is to reduce the variance in rewards, not to avoid storing and validating the blockchain. Just because the new hash requires you to be able to operate a full node doesn't mean you'd want to.

If bitcoin's resilience to fractional reserve banking depends on people being strongly ideological about it, then it's not resilient at all.

You may not even need to. The thin client doesn't rely on the validity of the blocks for its security model, it relies solely on the amount of work performed. Hashing utxo in the header doesn't change this too much.
You could mine a fake chain by not bothering with the memory requirements, and you'd get a speed advantage over other miners, but perhaps not dramatically so.

Totally agree that handling side effects properly is key. I think this is at the root of the reentrancy issues in EVM. Smart contracts ought to be as close to pure functions as possible, which means moving any side effects to the output of the function. Calling another contract in the middle of the execution of one is problematic.
I have seen a *lot* of criticism of the EVM based purely on a misunderstanding of Rice's theorem, so I felt I needed to address it.

Here's a theory:
He might have evidence which isn't completely convincing on its own, but much better than what he presented better. By presenting deliberately poor evidence, he gets people to say he's obviously full of shit and has nothing. Then he presents better evidence and discredit the critics by making it appear that they are moving the goalpost.
