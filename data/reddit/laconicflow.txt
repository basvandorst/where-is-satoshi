When people buy, price rises. When people sell, price falls. Think of Bitcoin like a very riskey sstock on a hell of a run.

Currently its an investing bananza of ungodly poportions. No one knows where exactly the bubble will pop, if we did there wouldn't be a bubble. My advice is get in while the gettings good, watch carefully

So I have a question and it might be dumb.  The value of big stocks in say, 1980 was still much lower then their value in 2007,8 when the crash happened, and we've been in a eight year bull market. If you'd just held onto the assets in that fund you'd have gotten it all back?
@_date: 2017-12-05 03:57:25
Well it was a bear market

Someone will have a bettter explanation, but a future is a bet on where a financial asset will be some time from where it currently is. You can go google oil futures, for example, or gold futures to see what that looks like.

My GUESS is that at some point in the future btc will hit 12k again. But I dont know if that's in a day, a week, a month, or when the bubble bursts.

He's alright.

Stocks are supposed to change in value, so are home prices. That's the point of owning capital. Electricity is the only example that counts. Inflation means the value of your money drops, so a hundred dollars is worth less now then ten years ago. Assets that appreciate is different from inflation. In a healthy market, home prices increase! 
@_date: 2017-11-28 02:50:07
I thought I heard of some capital gain related loopholes. Now I just can't remember what they are.
@_date: 2017-11-12 13:27:33
That's cool.
@_date: 2017-11-27 22:51:23
But how many people are using it V just investing in it?
@_date: 2017-11-28 10:48:57
Inflation's 2% if that
@_date: 2017-11-06 14:14:56
Everything is a matter of perspective. I'm paying for American power. On a foreign policy front. And we'll get that sentencing reform soon.

I thought about making the edit, and then I said fuck it.
@_date: 2017-11-28 12:24:10
Last couple years, that's what I've seen. Am I wrong?
@_date: 2017-11-26 23:09:27
That's how I look at it right now. Some people are in it for ideological reasons. I'm in it because I've doubled my money.  
@_date: 2017-11-05 18:35:36
Coinbase, I think, charges a lesser fea. But when you buy, you should be looking for more than  in gains, as in, ten% of  is  
@_date: 2017-11-02 19:35:20
Hey. . . Dumb question, but how can I buy and sell btc in  realtime, as in buy the dip ten mins ago and sell the rise, and then buy the dip. The exchange I use now doesn't allow that.
Thanks so much if you know.
@_date: 2017-11-05 18:39:02
I just read that post and have no idea what it means.  I have coins in coinbase right now, what happens after the fork?

If you bought, and are already in the red, I'd hold. Up and up and up and up just isn't normal, and this is the first super major downturn since december
@_date: 2017-11-26 09:52:06
You don't. The value of Bitcoin isn't in bitcoin, its in the fact that Bitcoin is currently beating the shit out of all other investments I've ever seen. 
You buy bitcoin, wait until its abov where you bought it, then sell.
@_date: 2017-11-02 20:55:27
I don't have to daytrade better, I just have to daytrade well.
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:31:26
Yes you can buy a dollar a day if you want. . . Think of bitcoin like any other stock, the more people who buy shares of google, the more google is worth. Buy bitcoins, the more bitcoin is worth. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 23:00:19
I'm not a bitcoin expert, I'm a guy who comes to this from watching the markets. And I think if it drops to 2k, that'll be in the midst of its death spiral. I suspect Bitcoin will either keep going up or never go below 4k again. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:47:32
The people on this sub generally won't admit this because they're ideological, but Bitcoin is ultimately going to be useful massively or just a bubble. Right now, I'd argue its imporible to tell which.
@_date: 2017-11-11 18:16:42
For many people bitcoin is a nonideological investment. You don't have to fucking blow the fuck up when we ask questions. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 13:00:05
I think its now.
@_date: 2017-11-03 07:58:51
what? I've been told bitmex, bitmax and now gdax, what's going on? 
@_date: 2017-11-29 12:38:52
At this rate, give it till next Tuesday.

The major problem I see with this school of thought is, are people using it or investing in it?
I know that I'm just treating it like a financial instrument, I have money in it because its making me money, I use dollars when I want to buy things.
I'm not trying to shit on your point, but my question is is it actually being used increasingly for daily activity? Because if most of this new money is investment money, then that's a bubble.
@_date: 2017-11-11 15:41:05
No one can see the future. You either believe that Bitcoin is generally on its way up, in which case now is a great time to buy, or you don't believe that and no dip matters. No one can see the future. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 22:49:30
hey, can you transfir that money into stocks or into other equity so you don't have to pay that capital gains tax? 
@_date: 2017-10-03 19:50:18
I get the investment side more than the cripto side. I currently own bitcoin. Without getting into technical details, what do I need to know about the fork?  Do I somehow get more bitcoin or less bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-10-08 19:20:41
I'm not a bitcoin expert, but just watching the price every day, I wouldn't be surprised if we get to 5k by this upcoming Thursday.
@_date: 2017-09-30 00:21:42
if you get twenty percent return, keep in mind the average return in the stockmarket is six percent per year.
@_date: 2017-10-08 20:32:41
Yeah. Its like making a paypal as in the account you make has to be linked to your money so you can deposit and withdraw. Others know more then me and can explain better. 
@_date: 2017-10-03 20:12:18
Thanks. How do I figure out if I can get my hands on that new coin?
@_date: 2017-10-12 08:13:48
We might see it in ten minutes.
@_date: 2017-10-17 02:33:07
Anyone know how much Bitcoin they're using? Sorry if it was in the article.
@_date: 2017-10-08 19:22:10
Right, but it only matters how much cash you put in. $300, or $3000 are going to net you a percentage gain when bitcoin moves. 
@_date: 2017-10-18 08:02:56
I don't know but its unbecoming. I have money  in  bitcoin right now, but I have no idea if it'll be around in ten years or not. But when I see a 700% return, I pay attention.
@_date: 2017-10-18 08:06:03
You're looking at it backwards.
@_date: 2017-10-12 23:43:40
Yes I fucking did! And it feels really good! 
Now, I have no idea. Its up another $300 past 5k! I have no idea where the ceiling is.
@_date: 2017-10-18 08:08:32
I'm not convinced bitcoin will last. I am convinced that because others are convinced it will, the odds of it being a good investment in the near term are good. . . Even though its down 6% today.
@_date: 2018-12-20 11:51:13
People who want bitcoin to be a longterm thing should hope most for slow growth and stability. Breaking $4000 only highlights bitcoins Abismal performence this year.
