Unfortunately this is still wrong. Short term capital gains are taxed as ordinary income. 
The 15% vs 20% is just decided by your tax bracket, but either way only applies for long term capital gains.

From the linked thread:


GOOD DECISION.

Think that raises an interesting question — are Bitcoin, Ethereum and altcoins *complements* or *substitutes*? At first glance they appear obviously to be substitutes. If you have a dollar to convert, you have to choose where it goes at the exclusion of other crypto currencies.
But your argument is interesting. If they are complements, then growth of Bitcoin would fuel altcoins and vice versatility. That’s a pretty reasonable thesis. 
One could look at price movements to determine the relationship. If demand for Bitcoins increases as the price of Ethereum rises, one could say they are substitutes. If BTC demand falls, one could say they are complements. My guess is if we looked at this over time, we would see both behaviors exhibited at different times.

Looks like the price fell ~500USD for only a minute. Any thoughts? Seems like this has been happening recently -- any relation to the large number of unconfirmed transactions in mempool?

I'm a legit Bitcoin hodler (since 2013) and I approve this message.
I'm getting antsy...

This is theoretically correct. The fact that this arbitrage is generally possible is what applies a narrowing pressure to the two prices. 
In a perfectly liquid market, this sort of price disparity wouldn't exist. But because of the regulatory hurdles, and processing time at all levels, it's difficult for arbitrageurs to operate given Bitcoin's incredibly volatile price. That's why the price disparity remains.
There **is** money to be made there, but it's neither trivial nor risk-free.

This is **wrong**. If you sell a Bitcoin at profit one week after purchase, it’s a short-term rather than a capital gain and you pay your standard marginal income tax rate on the profit. 
So always hold for at least a year if possible, as capital gains taxes are significantly lower than income taxes.

That’s right. Coinbase takes a spread of 25 to 100 basis points depending on the size of your transaction.
