I like your point of view. Ofcourse it's not all going to be as exciting as when we're soaring up into the thousands, but 1BTC was pretty stable at $800 for over a month now. Just like it was stable for months before October 2013. Does it make for some interesting storytelling? No, unfortunately not, but some more level-headedness on this sub would be very welcome.

Though I'm nowhere near an expert, wouldn't that make sense considering they claim to be fixing technical issues?
@_date: 2014-02-09 03:02:04
That certainly doesn't look very promising. I should probably be very glad I don't have any BTC or dollars in there.

Fair point! But think of it like this. People hear something on the news about "cryptocurrencies", "Bitcoin" etc., have no idea what it means and come across this subreddit while they're looking for more info. Now a subreddit sounds like the perfect place for their questions and curiosities, and for people new to it all it can be extremely confusing what everything means - after all, if I had a question about Doctor Who I'd go to if I wanted to find out more about Minecraft I could ask questions in so if I want to know what all this Bitcoin stuff is about I go to right? 
Well no, fuck them, they're getting yelled at and downvoted to oblivion! You just made it look to people who might've been really interested in cryptocurrencies, and probably Bitcoin specifically, like you're some kind of special club for elitist bankers only (somewhat ironically, I'd say). First thought upon trying to learn about this amazing new technology? "Definitely not something I should, or need to, get involved with!"
If those people had been met with a friendly, helpful community that explained why it *is* worth getting involved with Bitcoin or cryptocurrencies in general, people would be more trustful of this technology that, admittedly, can be somewhat scary and overwhelming if you don't know what it's all about. Consequently, your market cap could have been a lot higher as more people bought in. While you can compare Bitcoin's cap as it is now to Dogecoin's, you can't compare it to what it might've been with the best of both worlds. This is what I meant when I spoke of steering people away from Bitcoin, and as Bitcoin is undoubtedly the largest cryptocurrency, and the one currently most likely to succeed in the long term, it's worth exploring options to improve its user-friendliness, not only to people who are already active in cryptocurrencies but also those who may still be. After all, you need the support of people everywhere and not just the ones that are already in on it if you want to go large.

I think you're missing the point of this post. It's about what steers people away from Bitcoin, which can (and if you're pro-Bitcoin *should*) be fixed. Dogecoin is an example Bitcoin, or at the very least could learn from, *in this aspect*, and I don't think OP meant to claim anything else.

Example with made-up numbers: Person A sells 100 BTC to Person B with a 1% fee, and pays that 1% (1 BTC) to MtGox on top of the 100 BTC he just sold. 101 BTC have been removed from A's account, 100 showed up for B's account. The important part: MtGox now owes 100 BTC to these two people instead of 101!

Is it not possible to follow *anyone*'s deposit to Mt.Gox around the Blockchain? I don't know particularly much about it myself but it sounds like that should be possible to find their wallet(s).

For an explanation of the technical aspect behind it, in a very understandable way, I haven't seen anyone explain it better than the guy in [this video](

True, I just thought we were talking about the title here. In the given examples, both the title and the article were correct, but in this article about MtGox, only the article is, while the title could easily be misunderstood by a layman.

What? It says "Clean Energy Center CEO", i.e. she's the CEO of the center, not of the energy. The other guy isn't said to be a "coffee CEO" either, instead it says Phoenix Coffee CEO. The name of the company is literally Phoenix Coffee. Neither of those examples are an argument in your favour.

For comparison:
Current value of all available Bitcoins: ~15 billion
Current amount of United States debt: ~17 trilion (1000x Bitcoins value)
Bitcoin means just about nothing compared to numbers as high as the US' debt.

I think your title is incorrect. In the 2nd question of the survey 17% say Bitcoin has a long-term investment value, **not** that they themselves are long-term investing.
In the 1st question, 15% say they **are** long-term investing though. Another 15% have bought it buy are not planning to keep it long-term, and 70% that they aren't buying Bitcoin at all.
No idea how neutral this survey is (Bitcoin-interested people are probably more likely to reply to it than those who aren't), but that would suggest that about 50% of Bitcoin-owners who took this survey are long-term investing.

For me the answer is what is often said on this subreddit: buy Bitcoin, but only with money you can afford to lose. I read someone's comment about an hour ago: "consider every dollar you spend on Bitcoin burned" - if you can continue your life (and your study) without the money you'd put into Bitcoin, it's safe for your personal situation to do so. Whether you think the idea behind Bitcoin itself is worth putting money into is a decision only you can make, but many pro-arguments can be found here :)

Somehow, this article came to mind...
Anyway, as some people have said: get your parents in on it, talk to someone higher up like a principal, maybe other teachers if you think they'll understand... Try to stay calm, you'll rarely be taken seriously when you're yelling. Good luck :)

How about we keep this in mind: "China" is not, and "The Chinese" are not a hivemind, just like "The Americans" or "The Europeans" (or any EU country) aren't. There are many large players everywhere, and many smaller ones as well. Claiming anything else is just plain wrong.

Why 'in a few hours' if I may ask? I'm not gonna pretend to be an expert, but most of the time I've seen a relatively strong price drop it started going back up within the first hour or so.

Well [apparently]( it's been there for 4 days or so, so I don't think that's what caused the prise to go up.

In the Netherlands ("Dutchland?" Really?) it's been obligatory for decades and nobody's complaining about it.

Just saw this on a popular Dutch news site, couldn't find anything to say but "What the hell is he talking about". If there was ever anything to make me see why telling people about Bitcoin is important, it's nonsensical statements like this in a place where many people with little knowledge of its true benefits are reading it. The comments section makes for some awful reading as well, but that's not exactly rare on some news sites.
Here's the article, cleaned the translation up a bit:

Let's not get overly optimistic now. Most likely, the site will simply be blocked in China at some point in the future, probably sooner rather than later, in a similar way to many other websites that are being blocked (Facebook is a well-known example). Some Chinese people can (and do) get around such blocks using a proxy server, but it would essentially kill Bitcoin entirely for anyone who's not relatively tech savvy. 
Lots of people don't feel the need to use proxy servers, simply because they're fine with how it is, or they don't even know what they're missing (so essentially, they're not missing anything). Compare it to this: would you care if Chinese websites were being blocked on your computer? It's a bit of an extreme example because of the added language barrier, but you get my point.
This is coming from a Sinology student - I'm not an expert by any means, but I'd just like to give my own opinion.
@_date: 2013-12-11 15:09:43
How can changes be implemented if it isn't centralised? I thought that Bitcoin basically "is what it is" and can't really change further. What am I missing?
@_date: 2013-12-22 10:01:36
How is that measured when the amount of bitcoins in the address has changed over time? For example, I get x amount of BTC on day 1, the same amount on day 11, and then I spend the same amount on day 21. How can you know whether you spent the first or the second one?
@_date: 2013-12-04 17:32:04
Unfortunately he doesn't seem to be joking, though I wish he was. You're right, *if* it was flawed beyond redemption it would be worthless to have them, but from articles like these people will get the impression that that's going to happen no matter what, while Bitcoin is actually very secure. Maybe not flawless, but really, is there anything that is?
 from 54:35 onward (interview in Dutch).
@_date: 2013-12-06 16:05:30
Same for Dutch Rabobank. What say do they even have in it? Even a government could not prevent Bitcoin trading entirely except by blocking/censoring all related websites - a statement by a bank has even less effect.
@_date: 2013-12-10 20:57:14
What would other side consequences of an internet kill switch be? I know it simply *must* be extremely damaging but I can't think of a single example.
