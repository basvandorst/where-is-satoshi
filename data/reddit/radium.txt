Not an error, just a little experiment at an attempt to predict the next peak value. It's the previous peak * avg peak-to-peak percentage difference + the previous peak. The one above that is the previous estimate which turned out to be a bit low compared to the actual peak we had in December. The next peak should hit around that value if the historical average peak to peak trend continues. No guarantees of course Lol :)
The estimate is a bit conservative because I don't include the outlying initial price to the first peak since it was an abnormally high increase due to the initial value being near zero.

No the date in the lower section is the date the prediction was edited. I've updated the new one to be the current date until the next peak. Sorry for the confusion. You can't predict when the peak/low will happen.

I made a google spreadsheet with the peaks and the lows as well as the current value via coinbase API:
This low is only at -57.99% compared to the last low which hit -82.30% or the lowest low in 2011 which dropped -87.86% from peak to low.

on 5/21 I estimated the peak would hit $8,900 at some point in the future (you can't predict when). Well, the new estimate based on the updated data from the last peak in December says we should be hitting over $200k for the next peak. *shrug* My estimate was low last time ;) Lol. I have a feeling it won't though due to the exorbitant fees, unless something comes along to solve that.

Here you go, the "All" time chart is here: 
It's hard to see the peaks and lows on a visual graph. I had to narrow it down on the historical data table to get the numbers for the peaks and lows on the sheet.

Well, to be fair the people who were playing around back then were no different, they had/have generally the same human brain as everyone today unless there is something I am missing out on?
