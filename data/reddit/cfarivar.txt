FTC's Jay Mayfield told me this morning that the docs were unsealed 5pm CT yesterday, "though I don’t think they were functionally public until this morning when the court opened."
I downloaded probably somewhere around that time off of PACER, by pure coincidence.

Cyrus Farivar here. I'm a reporter with Ars Technica working on a story about GAW and Garza. I just got off the phone with him earlier today and would love to speak with anyone that has had direct dealings with the company and/or has direct knowledge of financials of similar companies. He made some claims that sound wild to me, but I want to check.
