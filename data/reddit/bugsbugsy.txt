Seriously. The desperation of these people begging for free coin (whether or not they were affected by the BFX hack) is pathetic. Have some dignity.

I don't think fixing the screen on the old phone will help at this stage. From what he's described, it sounds like he backed up the old phone and then erased it because he had plans of selling it/giving it away.

Understandable! Cheers Luke

Awesome! Would you consider releasing a version of core (or knots?) with a working implementation of UASF? I'm sure I speak for many if we were able to run code that was released by a developer that has roots in core development.

Ah, sorry. To clarify, it was a post someone made to 8btc which Jihan later posted to his weibo account. OP may be referring to another post Jihan authored personally that I'm unaware of.

Is it possible for the 95% activation rule to be  changed so segwit can activate sooner and end this debate?

Its pretty clear at this stage that Roger Ver is one of the most hated people in Bitcoin. The fact that he's on a mission to divide the community for his own personal agenda speaks volumes about the type of person he is. The whole bullshit attack on the car he drives is petty, though - what he is trying to achieve proves beyond doubt that he's a crooked cunt.

So its a card with a qr code that people can scan to send the card holder a payment? It looks nice but what advantages would this have over just opening a wallet app on your phone and having them scan the qr code from  that? Just trying to figure out if there are more features that I'm missing as its not immediately clear from the website.

Thanks for your reply, Luke. I've been reading about the UASF idea since shaolinfry made the proposal. What is your personal opinion on UASF? Im tempted to compile and run the amended version of Bitcoin core but I've read some mixed responses about the benefit it gives us (the users) and the potential risks a soft fork would impose. 
I'm always wary using anything from unverified sources especially when it comes to Bitcoin, so it goes without saying that I would prefer to run something officially released by core, but the current options don't presently offer a swift solution to ending the debate.
I understand this would be your personal opinion and not a representation of core developers collectively; I am mainly asking as I would trust the feedback from someone who has been involved in Bitcoin in the capacity you have (and for as long as you have). There is a lot if misinformation floating around so its getting difficult to separate the crud. Appreciate any insights you can provide!

Hey Rusty,
Very helpful information, thanks! I was reading about Tax Information Exchange Agreements (TIEAs) earlier, so you've definitely raised some good points here. 
What I had been thinking about doing was keeping the funds that I trade with (and subsequently the profits generated from those trades) in a tax exempt company/bank so that I'm only charged on personal income taxes when I bring the money back in to pay myself a "wage". 
I intend on speaking to a local accountant who specialises in international taxes before pulling the  trigger on anything, but was hoping to get some recommendations on legitimate companies who offer these offshore incorporation services in the meantime. I don't intend on cheapening out, and will happily pay a premium to deal with a reputable and knowledgeable company that can educate me, and offer the best option for what I'm trying to ultimately achieve (legally, so I'm not without recourse or end up in the shit with local tax authorities).

It's ironic that Coinbase co-founder/CEO recently wrote a blog post titled "Controlling Your Own Wealth as a Basic Human Right." when his company is responsible for holding so many people's BTC hostage daily. 
The amount of people that complain about Coinbase is astounding - how are these guys still in business? Their support team is non-existent, and they make customers wait days/weeks/months to regain access to their accounts/BTC after erroneously locking them out and providing no information as to why. They've been pulling the same old shit for years. Baffles me. 
We've somehow accepted that this is the norm with BItcoin businesses/exchanges, so companies like Coinbase continue to get away with their shoddy practices . These companies need to start being held to a hire standard.

Hah. Have you had experience incorporating in panama? It seems to be a favourable choice by many. Looks like mossack fonesca were the guys to talk to about setting up there, but anything to do with them now I assume would put you under a huge amount of scrutiny due to the scandals that unfolded around them last year. Who have you used to set you up in panama?

There is a $20B system at stake here which is currently being dictated by a handful of nefarious miners that are intentionally hindering the growth of Bitcoin, damaging the ecosystem, and splitting the community in the process. Why? Solely for their own financial gain. This is unacceptable. 
Miners were never intended to have this much control. Many people would prefer if SegWit activated without a UASF, but at this rate it just won't happen with the current 95% miner support requirement. BIP148 is much more than a proposal to get SegWit activated; it demonstrates to bad actors that the *community* has the ability to disrupt their plans and drive Bitcoin forward with or without their support. 
While the current implemenation does increase the risks of minor disruptions occurring should the UASF trigger, I still believe that the pros far outweigh the cons. Unless another proposal is made that would allow SegWit being triggered on a date or specific block height and not by miner consensus, and also rectifies the incompatibility issues the current implementation imposes on older software, then BIP148 is probably the best option the community has. 
I also agree that some of the community's motivation to proceed with a UASF is driven by emotion, but that is simply the result of people growing tired of sitting idly by while Roger Ver, Jihan Wu and the rest of the BU drones are going on tirades to spread their anti-core and anti-segwit propaganda to push their own agenda. BIP148 gives us something that we didn't have before - it gives us a voice. Its united the community to take a stance and push back on the resistance we are getting from these guys.

It'd make more sense to just begin at m/0/1 and increment every time a new order is submitted using Bitcoin as the payment method. Each order would still be assigned its own unique wallet address and there's no need to have such a large gap. 
I assume you're doing it the way you are to track payments associated with an order, but it'd be best to track them programmatically. One way to do this would be when an order is submitted, you can poll the blockchain to see if the address has received a confirmed transaction and then email you to let you know that it is good to be processed. You'd want to set a timeout for this method so you're not forever polling addresses for people who submit orders and then don't end up paying.
Some additional logic you'd want to add would be to also check if the BTC amount received to the address matches the amount associated with the order, and if not, send off an email to let the customer know. You'd probably want to do the same for timed out orders too so people don't send a payment to an address that isn't being polled anymore.
Rolling your own Bitcoin payment solution from scratch can be pretty involved. Looks like you're using WooCommerce? Check out  - it supports HD wallets already and has all the things I mentioned above (and more) already baked in.

If you have *just* emailed support why don't you give them a chance to reply to your support request before making a post on reddit?

To be fair, it was their decision to sell, although I do understand their thought process at the time (they had no trust left in bitfinex and wanted get what they could and pull everything off the exchange). Bitfinex does deserve some credit here though - they kept their promise where a lot of other exchanges in their position would have just folded or exited leaving their customers with nothing at all. The origin of the security breach still leaves a lot of questions unanswered so they're not completely off the hook, but at least they're taking steps in the right direction to rebuild their reputation and earn back the trust of the community. Hopefully they don't do anything to lose the trust they've been working so hard to get back.

If you're that strapped for cash maybe it'd be best to put that dollar towards cost of living as opposed to an investment in a highly volatile crypto currency? Not trying to be a jerk, but if you're in a position where you can't spare more than a dollar, then now probably isn't the best time to be purchasing Bitcoin.

You might want to double check that you've configured the node to listen for connections on a public IP address and not just localhost if you've specified the bind parameter in your bitcoin.conf. Post the contents of your bitcoin.conf file so we can take a look (omit your rpc user/pass details).

I understand, it is certainly daunting when btc goes missing - especially due to the poor reputation a lot of Bitcoin businesses have when it comes to customer service. I just think that while social media is an excellent tool for getting the attention of a company, a lot of people treat it as a first choice over the official support channels a company offers instead of a last resort.
It's only fair to give them a reasonable amount of time to respond before resorting to reddit moments after you sent them an email. It's very likely to be a trivial issue that their support team can resolve for you given the chance to review your email. If it turns out to be a shit fight to get assistance or there's clear signs of wrong doing, then a reddit post to spread awareness or get the issue pushed further up the support chain would be justified, but doing so prematurely just seems a little unfair.

Commas*. If you're going to be condescendingly dishing out grammar advice, then you probably want to do so without making grammatical errors of your own in the process. Just sayin'.
