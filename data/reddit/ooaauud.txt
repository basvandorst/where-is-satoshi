The term "fork" only makes sense in the git dev world. Fork means a repository takes a separated way, but changes can/will be pulled into the main repository. When you look at the changes graphics, it looks like a fork, hence the term "form". The bcash coin, only copied the bitcoin blockchain, instead of starting with an empty blockchain. But it will never more pull/interact with the one and only Bitcoin. Anyone can clone the bitcoin code from github, and clone the bitcoin blockchain data file, and create an alt coin with all the bitcoin history of wallets and keys and numbers.  It is blatantly nonsense uterly uber bullshit to treat this alternate side project as something "Bitcoin". It is not bitcoin, at most a Chinese Counterfait bitcoin. But it has no value, because no one can trust a code that has not been tested, no one can trust a network that lays in hands of a single miner, there is no point in givin real value to a carbon copy blockchain.  The value of the bitcoin comes from its history, from the hours and electric energy people devoted, form the trust people devoted, and from the fact that its code is the choice of a majority of hundres of thousands of nodes, of thousands of devs. If Jihan guy proposed a change in Bitcoin code, if hundres or five thousand people agrees with him, fine. But it is not the majority, it did not made to the Bitcoin Repository, it did not happened. Nobody cares if the guy does not accept democracy and created his own altcoin copying the bitcoin blockchain, it is just fake, and an attempt to go against the natural development of open source code, and it happens in github, GNU, linux and so on.

"In most legal systems, a bank deposit is not a bailment. In other words, the funds deposited are no longer the property of the customer. The funds become the property of the bank, and the customer in turn receives an asset called a deposit account (a checking or savings account). That deposit account is a liability on the balance sheet of the bank. Each bank is legally authorized to issue credit up to a specified multiple of its reserves, so reserves available to satisfy payment of deposit liabilities are less than the total amount which the bank is obligated to pay in satisfaction of demand deposits."

It is easier to create a regulated and safe system with digital money, than with paper money.
And it is easier, safer and better if the digital money is an open blockchain (bitcoin), than a simple digital database inside each private bank network.
Big banks had been caught in big fraud schemes. There is no reason for modern society to depositate so much trust in the old banks COBOL mainframes... 
The beauty of bitcoin, is that it works without borders and regulations, but for anything that needs a specific control of the money, where it comes from and where it goes, blockchain is ready, out of the box. The moment a user declare a wallet, and if the user wants/need the coins from that wallet will be tracked forever. So if it is a common agreement of a specific credit system, to track the money, it will be tracket "bit-perfect". But even in such case, every part still has the liberty to go rogue, in case there is a major disagreement , or a government turns out to be represive (venezuela) . For the scenarios where each part need to trust each other, comes it play multisig keys, there part of the key may stay in the hands of a scrow/regulator. Every aspect of our modern economy improves with blockchain, and I say Bitcoin's blockchain.

The bank industry has no where else to evolve. Bank reached a peak. A bank can seize your money/gold under political arguments, no technology can fix that. In fact, more technology can result in more political sourveillance and more seizing of funds unders suspicious arguments. Imagine too much "big-brother" power under the wrongs hands.
On the other side, there is no limit to what can be created/programmed software/UX -wise to make the use of bitcoin pratical and fluid and safe... Give it 10 year and google bitcoin again.. you may discover a rich ecosystem of services, more profiteable and safe than HSBC/Citibank ever dreamed off..

Yes, I am having a great day. No joke, I am selling some BTC today, because I am going on vacations next month. While we are on a bear market, I bought my first bitcoin at $30, on MtGox. Before MtGox colapse, I had already made 10 times my initial investment. When bitcoin colapsed, it took all the coins I had. In 2017 I sold my claim , again for 10x my initial invesment. I been buying bitcoin again since 1500usd price.. So even in a bear market, I can sell some now, to go on a vacation. I *could* been a milionaria by now.. I am not.. For real, no lambo.. only a few bucks to travel a little.  So if we judge only by the year *lows*, bitcoin has been the best finalcial investment I ever made. Not that I am into buying stocks. If I lived in the USA, probably I would have been buying stocks for a long timw now.. But I live in south america, and my country is full of taxs and regulations.. The result is that if you try to invest anything under than 5000 usd on stocks, you probably will pay more taxes than you can profit.. It is taxes everywhere, there is no way to run from it. So back in 2012/2013/2014 bitcoin was the easiest "investment" I could do form the confort of my home, without any hassle.
Anyone who lives in a corrupt south american country, does not have very much simpathy for taxes and regulations. I understand one who lives in a balanced country, where you receive back in public services and security, what you have paid in taxes, you are more OK with paying then. You experience the economic "karma" of paying and getting back. But all the "zen" theory about economics is not really my point... I will dive into the key aspects of your reply. With all the respect, and glad to be part of a high level talk:
"In your first sentence you say "It's easier to create a regulated and safe system with digital money..."
Then you say "The beauty of bitcoin is that it works without borders or regulations...""
Yes, bitcoin works without regulation, and works even better if we want regulation. Sounds paradoxical? Think paper money.. It is possible to trace paper money printing series, catch DNA data from paper money, tint it without UV responsive colour.. and so on.. At the same time, millions of dollars go out of the US borders, right into the direction of Mexical drug cartels, Everyday... Via cars filled with paper money bags... So paper money can work for the good and the bad.
Bitcoin is like paper money on steroids. If the US government declares: it can only accept bitcoins that traces back to regulated wallet. It will work. Impossible to counterfait.
Altought this does not prevent a underground/dark economy to work with bitcoins. But wallets and bitcoins can be "colored" and traced. So it allows a whole wide world of regulations and safety networks. It is that governments are not much into it as of now. But it is really something to think about.
1 - Fact. When the MtGOX collapse, the bitcon comunnity could try to hard fork the network, to "got back in history" before the mtgox hack, to have back the funds. But there was not even a chance this could really happen. Bitcoin blockchain is immutable. This is a new paradigm, it real value.
So much like diamonds. Diamons are really small and easy to "catch" on hand. If you have millions of diamons on a small bag, and you lost it.. Someone steals, or the diamond bag fall on the sea.. It is gone, forever.
But bitcoin private keys are to be taken care by professionals, with profesisonal tools. Many services can and will exist to make peoples life easier, not harder. I have said multiple times, there are already multisig wallets, that allow you to leave your coins with an exchange, but the exchange cannot "steal" it from you. It is pure computer software, there are no limits to software, and what can be improved in "user friendness" terms.
2 - I have been there, really sad. Again, just like a Bank can store you bag of diamonds, and give you a insurance. A bank can store your bitcoins. So there is nothing old paper money can do, that bitcoin cannot do. But there is a whole new world of possibilities bitcoin can do, that paper money, gold bars, of diamonds cannot, because they are not digital, at least they can have digital representation (our money is already digitalized by the banks), but still, bitcoin is a world common protocol for digital money, while banks had failed to create a universal protocol, as of now.
3 - True, a service like paypal for bitcoin, with constumer insurance, does that. This is not a problem for bitcoin, but for the services that integrate with it.
4 - Yes, it is a wild world out there. Not only bitcoin, but all the commodities. Do you really believe petrol should cost what it costs? I am pretty sure there is almost infinity petrol out there, but we are paying a surplus of price, sice 1970, because some goys want it.. At common people carries this weight on theier shoulders (expensive transportations, expensive food...). The only "stable" currencie in the world in the dolllar. Because it is the world reference unit, it is the most powerfull currencie. This is great for the federal reserve, but this quite fair... Dont get me wrong, I love USA and american people, really, but those banks, and the federal reserve, along with the EURO bank, do charge the world a little more what they deliver in exchange... I do believe bitcoin should/could be the world unit reference in the future, to bring more balance to the world. Unless you are one of the few bank owners, that means more quality of life (cheaper prices) for you too, even if you are an american (american people too pays the price banksters are chargin to control the dollar). Maybe I  sound too crazy for you as of now, but you can spare the good arguments from the "conspirancy theory" one at this point.
5 - I disagree here. You cannot measure Visa network, because Visa = all the banks it works with plus all the offices , all the light bulbs, all the building, all the service workers, all the banks industry resources consuption. There are many thid-party VISA card gateways, each one with theier own resources. Fun Fact, as of today, VISA payments seems to be down in the UK (google the news...). This concept of decentralized gateways was achieved with Lightning Network. So there is no more bottleneck, as long there are lithgning networks nodes, the real bottle neck is only that specific node bottleneck, in all terms, be it netowrk speed, lag from your datacenter, and etc. The sky is the limit now for bitcoin. ( = there is no limit).  
6 - I really do think that all the cypher schemes and signatures that had been put togheter under the names of blockchain, segregated witnes, lightning network, liquid, mimblewimble, and everything beign implemented as bitcoins improvement protocols... Are amazing tech, The best minds of it, making it grow organically.. I think bitcoin will evolve to a whole new thing in the future, and there wont be "another" coin, because bitcoin is not a coin, but a protocol... Just like the internet sort of...
Please excuse my terrible gramar... It is hard to write serious stuff in another lang.

you can only trust your life savings in HSBC money laundry.
Or you can divide it in gold bars, bank money laundrys, exchange bitcoins and bitcoins you keep in manu trezors. Now that is beign anti fragil. You can even send bitcoins to mars in case an asteroid hits earth. Bitcoin network already at blocksyteam satellite. Much futurism very.

This is so "not" cypherpunk:
- Enter your email AND phone? What else, your last tax declaration form?
- Prize calculated in fiat USD? What the ?
- Wallet to be announced, clues to be announced... You came

TA is bullshit. It is the same as random guessing.
But Risk Management is a thing.
Most people use TA, to pratice theier risk management strategy.
Nobody, even TA goys could predict BTC would fall from the \~16k ATH to nowdays \~4k.
But every "professional" TA investors had theier "stop loss" activated somewhere.
It is a shame because it seems to use BTC market to acomulate more USD / fiat.
My personal opinion is this just makes BTC more an "antifragile" asset (in Nassin Taleb's terms).
TLDR: TA is just another imaginary order, people try to create out of the chaos that is reality itself. Not the first imaginary order ever created, and wont be the last. Move along.

Is there any reason for the drop?
- Market cap for bitcoin tech is still very low.
- China has 15% o market volume. Nothing compared to other regions adopting bitcoin even more in the coming months.
- A potential "ban" in china or any country, will not change volume, because no industry, company, is trading bitcoin officialy. You cannot ban something that was never official. 
So bitcoin has only room to grow, and not backwards.
We may see bubbles when market cap is in the trillions.

It would be better if china bans bitcoin, and even better if take jihan-bitmain along.
I do believe chinese gov is fradulent and they rather stay out of the crypto market.
Google is also banned in Chiiina and so far, so good.

Will take time to shutdown anything in first place, as nothing illegal is going on. Some exchanges already got the paperwork done (remeber China baning bitcoin in 2013?) So most of them wont halt. 
Probably fees will go up in china, along with bitcoin price (already trading at 4023usd there, while europe is 3914.
There is no change in the big scenario.

Of course, a shity company with a market cap of 1 million could be a scam.
What is your point?
Look at the service bitcoin provides in trading funds.
Do you trust it? 
How much do you pay in fees to trust the blockchain?
Does it works when you want to sent 1 million from your contry to another?
How much do you pay in fees?
Is it fast, like, 30 minutes? Or does it takes 3 days like bank's swift?
If you analyze the big picture, bitcoin does the work a great work.
If bitcoin was a private company , it would value more than 70billion.
Because it does the job of many other companies, better and for less.
If you sum the value of what companies and services bitcoin does the job better, you get more than 70billion.

Hey "data geek", you should know bitcoin main feature is: data.  Bitcoin is a network of data, it offers all the data, of all wallets, of all transactions, all the time, for everybody. You can analise bitcoin hash rate, tx rate, coins distribution, block capacity, and on and on. Bitcoin is a protocol not a product. The second layer (lightning network for fast and micro payments, liquid for creating tokens, and etc) are protocols not products. Product are what companies build using those protocols. You can consider an exchange like "Bitfinex" like a geek-cassino built upon bitcoin protocol. Bitfinex is a product. Inside bitfinex you can borrow or provide funds (peer-to-peer credit). So we are not talking about bitcoin vs. banks here. Banks should and probably will create products upon bitcoin protocol. Funding is a major part of our economy, and there will always actors in this field. What bitcoin economy does in fact, and this is what cypherpunks knows really well, is to offer a hedge against central banks QE.

tl;dr: First time in history money with all the data avaliable, to everyone, real time.

I want to automante some trades with a API script, but My fear is to lose when lost contect with api goes in the event of a ddoss attack... So if this wechat interface was ok during the last attack, I may write my script for the wechat, and just forget about the api

Well, cryptographic signatures IS encryption, while encryption is not cryptographic signatures. The later is contained inside the former.
