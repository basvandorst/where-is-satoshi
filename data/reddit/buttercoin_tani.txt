We're not looking for additional support right now, but might be pretty soon. PM me and we'll talk!

Yep, that's right. You can withdraw your funds at any time, USD payouts take 1 business day via ACH, or same day via wire for amounts over $5k (if requested before 2pm PST).

Everyone here has a lot of good questions, and we want to be as transparent as possible with our customers. In the next few days we'll hold an AMA with our founders so you can get some answers!

Soon, we do have plans to open source it as soon as we launch! We'll make an announcement to let everyone know when they can check the updated github page.

If you're adding more than $5k we allow wire transfers for funding your account, those clear in 1 business day or less. And even our ACHs usually clear in only 2-3 business days (weekends or holidays may delay things though).
Other added bonus of Buttercoin: we run on OTC desk. If you're purchasing (or selling) large amounts, buying off-book can get you a significantly better price, and you don't pay a 1% fee.

What email client do you use? We'll work on making sure those go to people's inboxes from now on :)

We will be a full exchange, similar to Bitstamp, *not* a brokerage.
@_date: 2014-12-04 23:55:41
We currently only support the 10 major banks listed for account funding, but we do support 100% of US banks and CUs for payouts. We'll be opening up inbound ACH services for all banks in the next couple of weeks.

We actually have buy/sell up to $5k via ACH bank transfer, takes 2-3 business days for funds to get credited to your Buttercoin account.
Anything over $5k (limit is $1MM), can be done via wire transfer to our US bank. Funding time is same day or 1 business day, depending on the time it's submitted.
Feel free to PM me for more details.

We've tested our site on Firefox for desktop, but haven't hit all the mobile browsers yet. We'll get that fixed!

Correct, we're definitely not a brokerage. All users have full access to our order book and we also have OTC trading for large block trades. We currently support both ACH and wire transfers.

[Buttercoin]( has 0% trading fees right now. US customers only though (for now, we're working on it)

We're working on it!
@_date: 2015-01-23 17:13:08
US-based + ACH (+ wire) transfers you say? I think we can help there... 
@_date: 2015-01-23 17:17:34
We have ACH and wires with a US bank.
I'm sorry comrade, have a vodka on us @_date: 2015-01-06 17:53:19
Regulatory reasons. I cannot disclose details as it's a competitive secret, but we've structured our business model very carefully this way. But yes, basically we provide the same exact services as others like Bitstamp, Kraken, etc.
