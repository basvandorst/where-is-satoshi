This could also have been the exchange rebooting their MM bots. 
Doesn’t mean it was real traders
@_date: 2019-07-14 22:33:48
Wtf? No. Don’t anti fud this..!

he is talking about the non fake volume...
@_date: 2018-09-23 12:08:08
is it a plane?

had a bad day? 
@_date: 2018-09-22 07:57:21
THE BACKBONE!
@_date: 2018-09-21 17:47:47
naive or not, it has to be taken into account.   
Ranking exchanges in term of reported volume doesn't mean anything since nowadays several of them fake their daily transac using wash trading bots. I would recommend to check 'Total Trade Volume per Users' metric, website's traffic, bounce rate and community activity to get a better lecture of an exchange before connecting your API on it. Below a comparative board spotting BitForex TTVU anomalies based on their reported volumes. Im waiting for regulation to step in or DEX development to wipe out all this hoax. Meanwhile feel free to use "Adjusted volume" on CMC website to display a less biased ranking of crypto-exchanges' volume.

Day traders affect every other trader out there. And you cannot ignore that.
@_date: 2018-09-21 16:46:41
so true.. bitforex is total bullcrap

Scary that we do not know how much it can ACTUALLY do
@_date: 2018-08-06 07:35:23

When you sharpen his horns to pierce all the bears in the way
@_date: 2018-10-03 16:33:11
they have created it. I would not mention a product in my post if it is just another ICO speculation.
@_date: 2018-10-03 11:56:58
Is it that hard for you to read the table?  
BitForex users monthly volume compared to other TOP Exchanges is almost 13 000 USD. Where no other exchange has that kind of numbers. Even Huobi Pro is more than twice lower vs BitForex, which just screams out, the transactions are not real, orderbooks are fucked and results are unreasonable.
@_date: 2018-10-03 15:28:04
They must publish real data. That is the regulation of exchanges, even coinmarketcap requires to share this data for them to be listed on CMC.   
Not true, price is just the result. If you are looking just at the price while trading, well then good luck my friend!
@_date: 2018-10-03 16:10:51
I ain't advertising anything, they have not even contacted me for advertising. Main point is the exchanges problems I am discussing about. If you are but hurt about a small part of my post, than good luck in life. Seems like it is gonna be sad..
@_date: 2018-10-03 11:26:03
Thank you, Mr. Satoshi
@_date: 2018-10-03 15:25:21
Thank you! And the dude just deleted all his comments...
@_date: 2018-10-03 21:20:08
This is my DD. This is my work. I do not stand with my eyes closed when the system is fucked. I will show the community what is out there. On short term, sure, every individual will just trade and leave. But on long term, this is a big matter for every single trader: volume, liquidity transparency, price fluctuation, unorganical price and etc...
@_date: 2018-10-03 15:29:02
Correct, but some just over do it:)   
If this carries on, the price will fluctuate even more, will be harder for us to trade and catch a reasonable price.
@_date: 2018-10-03 15:59:44
Since CMC/CoinGecko strenghtened their policy towards exchange listing on their websites and now publish reported/adjusted volume discepancies, exchanges are more keen on opening their trading data to them. For instance CMC will deduct trade volume executed from accounts with 0% transac fees as they assume these logins are proprietary bots of exchanges mostly used to falsify volumes. In parallel, public data can confirm the veracity of reported volume (i.e Alexa ranking, twitter followers, number of adress interacting with exchanges..)
@_date: 2018-10-04 05:05:28
Thank you!
That is very well saud, happy to see people knowing more and more about this industry. 
@_date: 2018-10-03 21:14:43
Just like with Revolut. Customers "purchasing" crypto, but the terms say, if company goes bankrupt, they only return the fiat, not the crypto..
@_date: 2018-10-03 21:17:29
an outside affection will make a difference here. An exchange itself has no intention on creating a better situation for the trader. that is why we must look for assistance elsewhere, or start the riot ourselves and the media interferes, following that, court takes them down 
@_date: 2018-10-03 10:48:02
Yes, thank you!
@_date: 2018-10-03 12:11:26
You're welcome! This information is open to everyone, but to see the clear results, a few calculations have to be done. Was not hard, since I have been analyzing the traditional market for many years and now spend most of my time in the crypto market, working.
@_date: 2018-10-03 15:31:12
That is why we have to talk about it, so it get's noticed ASAP.  
This was a funny scenario, OKEx lent 400mil USD to a trader.... had a huge problem! [The scenario](
@_date: 2018-10-03 15:32:42
It actually does look like it. But rest assured, it ain't. I work as market analyzer, trader, used to invest a lot before in ICO's and now only sometimes. Found this project as it is in someway related to my work and mentioned it. 
@_date: 2018-10-03 16:08:52
You can never get a clear result. But you can always get as close as you want to the actual result by doing calculations and taking factors in matters. But I see your point. A lot of calculations are in a way speculations. But some are more towards the truth, some aren't 
@_date: 2018-10-03 12:46:55
sure it is..  
Binance has 17x higher monthly volume, but BitForex has 15x higher per user monthly volume. Even higher than huobi pro. that is surely fake.
@_date: 2018-10-03 16:01:36
It is not just cross market exchanging. I presented a clear problem by creating a table too. And the factors behind it has been mentioned. Which some of them are taken in matters by the exampled project. 
@_date: 2018-10-03 21:15:39
true. for a large exchange it is small chance to fail. also, a lot of times, when they start struggling, they usually get absorbed by another exchange. 
@_date: 2019-02-08 17:27:37
The price could have such a gain every other day of 100-200 USD
@_date: 2019-02-08 21:50:12
Best comment I’ve seen this year

Hey, many thanks!
@_date: 2019-02-08 18:21:35
Heck ye!!
@_date: 2019-02-08 18:22:20
What if people take things seriously in different ways? O.o
@_date: 2019-06-17 21:48:03
Many thanks
@_date: 2019-02-08 18:13:44
In a new lambo
@_date: 2019-06-09 01:23:56
Thank you for a reasonable answer.... everyone in crypto now thinks they know the financial problems that occurred and will happen
@_date: 2019-02-08 18:14:26
This is it!!!  The bottoms in!!!  Get rekt doubters, get rekt!!!  We are going to the mooon!!!!
@_date: 2019-02-08 23:13:11
But.. why not higher?
@_date: 2019-12-20 06:54:28
Are there any crypto exchanges supporting HK? 
If they would, how could an exchange support HK?
@_date: 2018-03-11 18:31:48

Could you share the link when it is up?? :o
@_date: 2018-03-11 18:34:09
there's a bunch of different theories..
@_date: 2018-03-04 16:23:32
Thanks dude! This made everything much more clear. 
@_date: 2018-03-11 18:23:05
or a 2k jump?
@_date: 2018-03-11 18:32:11
get the people talking! lol
@_date: 2018-03-04 16:06:05
Thanks for the reply. What are the chances that they fuck up?
And speaking in percentages, how much control does a person loose of his coins without the key? Like what is the motive for revolut to not give a key and make their feature simple as it is now? It cannot be true, that such a company has their bad intentions so easily “readable” 
@_date: 2018-03-11 18:06:46
Second jump incoming? :) prepare..
@_date: 2018-03-11 18:11:12
happens on sundays. Seems to be getting bullish
@_date: 2018-03-04 12:23:57
Yup, my bad. Was fast typing. Thanks for the answer
@_date: 2017-09-28 14:34:11
Is blockchain good for that? Talking about Europe
@_date: 2017-09-28 15:19:00
Thanks. And where do you sell? What site you prefer 
@_date: 2017-09-28 18:40:57
Thanks! I guess.. ? 
@_date: 2017-09-28 14:16:14
Yes, thank you. But that is just how I expressed the main actions of the app I am looking for. 
@_date: 2017-09-29 12:54:39
In my country you can’t use bitcoin as a currency yet. What are other options than mining, to earn it?
@_date: 2018-07-24 12:02:47
Heck ye!!!
@_date: 2018-07-24 13:43:41
correct. pretty handy and easy to use
@_date: 2018-07-24 12:36:46
I hope soon 8k :)
@_date: 2018-07-26 11:05:51
As much as I have looked in... It is one of the more legit and tryharding projects. Monitoring included
@_date: 2018-07-26 10:54:51
As I understood, their fees are gonna be unbearable 
@_date: 2018-07-20 14:45:52
Hope they finish it up
@_date: 2018-07-26 11:07:08
probably and looks like it. As a person with 0 programming knowledge, It is hard for me to understand the way the system works.
@_date: 2018-07-26 12:07:23
wise words, wise words my man. 
But you gotta work with it if you want it to happen. But overall, i couldn't agree more with you. 
Also, you do not have to understand how cryptocurrency works, or blockchain, to use it.
Look at today. Very little know how the current financial world runs, but everyone uses money. Everyone has a phone, uses it, but have no knowledge of how it actually runs. 
People do not have to understand the depths of crypto to use it. What's important that the people have to have an easy way to use it. Like apple. Creating amazing technology but super easy to use. 
@_date: 2018-07-26 10:59:31
This market situation has happened before. Bitcoin reaching the sky all alone. People following up the bull run, taking their assets out of all the alts and putting it into bitcoin. Later on, they usually distribute them back to the alts
@_date: 2018-07-26 10:56:41
Now it is up to us, to support the crypto-nation and lead it in the right direction
@_date: 2018-07-26 14:42:34
good point. 
But my statement was that I hope they fulfil their roadmap goals and develop the full platform
@_date: 2018-07-26 14:41:40
I do :)
have crossposted ORCA's ceo AMA to a different group 
@_date: 2018-07-26 11:00:00
Not sure. Have not seen any true competition. Only similar projects, doing parts of what these guys are doing
@_date: 2018-07-26 12:26:57
lower fees, decentralisation, transaction speeds, transaction amounts? The number of advantages is growing and growing
@_date: 2018-07-26 10:52:53
They released a pre-Alpha version already. But overall, I think the Idea is the most important part at this point. And from there on, we can just pray that they succeed 
@_date: 2019-05-30 11:09:36
the community is grateful
@_date: 2019-05-30 14:01:48
So.. if the whales do this.. we’ll all start selling now and killing the price ourselfes
@_date: 2019-05-30 16:20:05
Was the short recent pump to 9050 was due to our request??
@_date: 2019-05-30 15:52:17
IT’S OVER 9000!!!
@_date: 2019-05-31 07:51:14
please give your calculations
@_date: 2019-05-30 16:20:51
one love
@_date: 2019-05-30 12:53:24
hope for a good weekend after this...
@_date: 2019-05-30 11:26:59
then I'll take care of the drinks
@_date: 2019-05-30 11:11:25
lets not ask too much at once. 1 coin per week?
@_date: 2019-05-30 15:54:15
I’d love to see it
@_date: 2019-05-30 11:14:59
why are you on xrp? :o
@_date: 2019-05-27 00:43:38
More no
@_date: 2019-05-30 11:10:58
can we just start a massive pump festival?
@_date: 2019-05-30 11:48:51
well if you say so...   
\*yeets to an exchange
@_date: 2019-05-31 08:46:16
The sell wall you want to “eat” to get to 10k is not the same as in between 5&amp;6 or 14&amp;15k. It varies, so you always have to look at the sell orders and eat them when they are at their smallest
