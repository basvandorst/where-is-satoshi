i keep reading bitcoin has no value, except for what people assign to it. like if you can trade 1 btc for a loaf of bread that is btc value. guess what people that is how all the worlds currency works. all financial system are built on a house of cards. the usd is only as valuable as you make it. example the usd is suppose to be back by gold, which we all know it is not anymore. gold value derives from what people are will to pay for it. so lets the us federal reserve decides to put 1 ton of gold on the world market what would happen to price of gold it would plummet. now lets talk about the actual value of money as a whole. the us really owes china trillions of dollars, lets say china said i want all my money. the us can simply say no and war would ensue. the point i'm making is bitcoin has the best chance for every day people to control financial system and this scares the shit out of the government. i truly believe that people will realize this soon and all governments will have no chose except to get on board. now you say the government can just ban all crypto, but remember, in a free market anyway, it the people who have control of the government not the other way around. just remember their are a lot more of us then they are of them. thoughts?

here is the part i really don't understand and feel free to correct me if i'm wrong. china is worried about destabilization of cny, so wouldn't banning bitcoin exchanges make that worse. i saw nowhere that owning bitcoin in china is illegal. i understand that people can no longer trade bitcoin back to cny but what stops them from taking bitcoin out of the country and trading it to another currency. at least with the exchanges open the Chinese government had some idea of how much money was going into bitcoin. with the exchanges closed they will have no idea. its kind of like the US logic for not banning Islamic extremest on twitter or facebook. its better to see what their doing and who their speaking with. if china only accounts for 23% of the total market there is no reason why people won't take their money elsewhere. if i'm a criminal or a money launderer in china this is the best news i could hope for. draw all the attention alway from bitcoin so i can go back to using for my illegal activities. i really don't think china has thought this through at all.

does anyone know if the Chinese exchanges are allowing new fiat deposits. if so i think this may be a pump and dump. if i'm holding  a lot on bitcoin in a Chinese exchange, that i have to get out before the end of the month and i'm allowed to add new fiat to buy why wouldn't  I. if i'm a big Chinese investor why wouldn't  buy a crazy amount of bitcoin at this low price which would increase the price for when i'm forced to sell at the end of the month. i'm question really is, is this sudden spike in price just a result of china just trying the most they can for the bitcoins they have to sell, or is this just the rest of the world buying up the bitcoins at a greater volume then china is selling.
