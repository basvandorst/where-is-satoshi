I'm sure you're correct it's an uphill struggle, but I think the getting around it is actually not that hard... Say you're PCI compliant.  I'm just some jerk. I don't process cards, not compliant... nothing. I publish a database that you can download in its entirety which maps hashes to URLs. You download and cache the database. When you get a new txn, you look it up in your copy of my database. You never send the card or the hash outside your network. You never take a card from your merchant and store it in raw or hash format.

OK, so even if we can find some edge case where an argument could be made that it wouldn't jeopardize compliance (if)... you and ReddHerring seem to agree that it's a non-starter because the CC companies and the banks are disinterested.
I DO maintain though, that if we can find a way to give an edge to mature, already very competitive middle-men in these transactions, there's leverage. This idea, sadly, seems like it might not be it, but we should keep looking ;)
edit: for one final point about all or at-least most.  Not required.  At present, BTC consumers are used to being second class citizens. A system like this is near-zero commitment for the consumers and so a low-frequency, "surprise, CC txn hijacked!" would be a pleasant surprise, not a regular expectation.

The gateways (who need to be PCI compliant) need not store nor transmit hashes of their incoming cards.  Rather the gateway would clone a 3rd party database of hashes of cards (maybe cookie recipies) that was generated by an external system that need not be PCI compliant since they don't process cards.

At least now we know where all the missing MtGox coins went.

"Because transactions aren't hashed directly, hashing a block with 1 transaction takes exactly the same amount of effort as hashing a block with 10,000 transactions." - from 
So, how does this strategy help?

Yes, Agentina has a very shakey currency, and the records may contain details about a past sovereign default.

When Argentina had their abrupt devaluation, there were a lot of people who sought some means of escaping the deadline that wasn't controlled. A bunch found 1st-class airline tickets that were refundable. So if you know your currency is going to tank tomorrow, buy first class tickets to... everywhere, then cancel tomorrow and let the airline get screwed on the exchange rate for the refund. This story seems like the airlines might have learned something from this.
