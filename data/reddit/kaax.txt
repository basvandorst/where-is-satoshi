You can't really use transaction volume as any real measure of the bitcoin economy. It's quite normal (and recommended) for owners to transfer their coins between multiple wallets for a variety of reasons.
There's no way to tell from looking at the transaction history whether transactions represent actual exchanges or just a holder moving coins around internally.

Why don't you link to the real author of this news instead of a copy paste from a rather dubious newsoutlet? 
On topic: Imagine the new pastime for bored members of Anonymous and LulzSec: 51% attacks on Bank-coins issued by various large banks. 
Can't see any of them surviving without huge distributed systems comparable to that which Bitcoin has organically acquired.
On the other hand the smartest thing governments can do to fight Bitcoin is create alternatives like mintchip that have low or no transaction fees, offer merchants chargeback fraud protection with irreversible payments, but are denominated in a currency consumers already have. Getting money in and out of those alternatives can be made much easier than Bitcoin, yet they can build in secret or not so secret forms of transaction tracking to control anonymity, or just leave the payment systems anonymous at first and crack down later.
Bitcoin has nothing special to offer as a payment platform other than freedom from regulation and a widely distributed network.
@_date: 2013-05-05 20:01:17
I would argue it is simply not viable for miners to support transaction that worth a small fraction of a cent. Once one bitcoin worth more perhaps they will find it worthwhile to support smaller denominations. Turned out that blockchain space is a scarce resource after all and it is about to start being rationed.
Effectively, every Bitcoin transaction has some cost. It is not reasonable to expect a free market to continue doing something at a loss.
If you do not limit spam and do not start charging for transactions you might then start preparing supporting a blockchain with size in bytes larger than the number of atoms in the universe.

I think Bitcoin itself isn't making the media say stupid things. I think the media says stupid things *all the time*, it just happens that a lot of us, who knew Bitcoin from the beginnings and already have a fair share of knowledge on this subject, can see more clearly how inherently flawed a lot of the information is. 
This sudden uprise of awareness and the news coverage that came with it, surely made me even more skeptical about mainstream media, as no one is to be trusted. Financial Times, Bloomberg and all the big ones that have such a tremendous amount of weight behind them, are in the end inseparable from blogspam, as they have the same sensationalistic tendencies and didn't do their homework, at all. It's not easy to digest the phenomena Bitcoin, but at least have the decency towards your followers of not commenting on it until you have established a semi-understanding of the matter.

One of the neat things about bitcoin that hasn't been talked a lot about is that bitcoin makes it possible (with a little planning) to create seizure and "civil forfeiture" resistant money. This can be done if you want to save your money for later (perhaps for your defense, or for after your eventual release), or alternatively merely because you believe that civil forfeiture is unethical and dangerous to society as it accelerates the militarization of the police.
Imagine a system where the private material of a wallet is shared among one or more trusted individuals (using secret sharing) who are under instructions to cooperate with each other in destroying or moving the money if you are ever arrested or fail to check in after a certain period of time. If your aim is to merely destroy the money, you could also get away with having a secret VPS running somewhere that does the deed (it would not matter if it were later found).
If you go with the "destroy" route, then you would not even be destroying the evidence from an ethics standpoint (thanks to the nature of the blockchain). However the authorities, upon being denied their "prize", would undoubtedly throw a childish hissyfit and assert that you destroyed the evidence anyway.

Not that I'd wish monetary loss on anyone, but if the first Bitcoin crash is any indication, these things tend to have a positive side-benefit of driving out most of the speculators flooding in after all the news reports that fuel these cycles, and the people actually interested in the currency itself stay behind, with an influx of new folk.
After all the noise dies down, new businesses and services get built backed by the wider audience, and the ecosystem develops further.
It's not yet clear if this is a crash similar to the previous one, but if it comes, I don't think much will change in terms of Bitcoin's future for the next few years.

For those wondering why we don't have a Bitcoin ETF, this is one reason. Making a reliable market in decentralised and pseudonymous Bitcoins without an exchange is very difficult.

Oh, bitcoin community, when will you learn.

I didn't find it cringeworthy, as its like he said, completely irrelevant. 
The *interrogator* was pressing him to drop a name and in the heat he fusioned Satoshi Nakamoto to Sakamoto, plain and simple. Why bother telling the entire name and confuse this old man even more?

20-something is a very vague estimation of the actual years of life lived. I find it very peculiar and such uncertainty can only be followed by a huge loss of confidence in anyone reading your post. This will rather likely cause a high influx of upvotes, which in a state of euphoria isn't uncommon but will rather quickly be diminished by High Frequency Bulltraps that pound this comment down below the vote-threshold. Mark my words!

Here is what their introduction page says:
How TorEx Works?
TorEx is a site that allows you to sell USD and BTC anonymously. This is accoumplished by having the seller of USD mail the currency to the buyer using the mail system in all countries around the world. The system allows the seller to specify the country that the currency will be mailed from. The system has a automated reputation system which matches the seller of BTC and USD with the highest reputation scores. This system helps prevent fraud.

Not that I'd wish monetary loss on anyone, but if the first Bitcoin crash is any indication, these things tend to have a positive side-benefit of driving out most of the speculators flooding in after all the news reports that fuel these cycles, and the people actually interested in the currency itself stay behind, with an influx of new folk.
After all the noise dies down, new businesses and services get built backed by the wider audience, and the ecosystem develops further.
It's not yet clear if this is a crash similar to the previous one, but if it comes, I don't think much will change in terms of Bitcoin's future for the next few years.
@_date: 2013-04-08 17:08:41

Hello! I just found out about this subreddit. 
My name is Danjuma Sule, one of the sons of major Gen Gumel Danjuma Sule, The late Nigeria's former minister of mines and power in the regime of the late former Nigeria's military Head of state, Gen Sanni Abacha. 
When my father died he left me an inheritance of 9830422.33333421 bitcoins. Unfortunately bitcoin exchanges are not yet set up in Nigerian currency and I am in need of a young techno wizard with a bank account denominated in US dollars to assist me in gaining access to my inheritance.
It is on this basis I am seeking for assistance. Your percentage is negotiable. Please note; your age and profession doesn't really matter in this transaction. Waiting for your immediate response and bank account specifics.
Regards, Danjuma Sule

I can only recommend this. OP needs to understand that the search results he gets aren't necessarily the ones everyone is getting. Google is heavily invested in tracking its users. You can install stuff like Ghostery or disconnect.me to see where Google is following you and block that activity. Google basically follows you everywhere, especially if you're a Chrome user. So what you get when using Google search, are personalized ad-infected search results. [DuckDuckGo]( seems a little clunky in the beginning but you definitely get a feeling for it after some use.
