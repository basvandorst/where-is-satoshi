As there are very few people knowing the indexing secrets of Google, this doesn't mean it made it to a webpage. It could even be possible that the link has been indexed from Gmail. The thing is, with share you want to share it with selected people. Not with the world. They should only be downloadable and findable if it is explicitly in public folder. Even better, dropbox content shouldn't be indexed at all.

Be careful with uploading your wallet.dat in dropbox. Files in dropbox (even the not shared ones) are being indexed by Google by filenames. It will be better for wallets to use random generated wallet filenames instead of having a default wallet.dat. Try this Google search: site:dropbox.com inurl:wallet.dat

I believe that is only when or the payment is charged by credit / debit card or when the payment has not been accepted yet.

Huobi is having or had some connectivity issues.

Just got some money on my paypal account, and instead of wiring it to my banking account thought of converting it into *coins. But thanks anyway.

The point I'm making: Be carefull with uploading sensitive data (especially files like wallet.dat), because you don't want it to end up in a Google index and be downloadable when you not intended to do so.

If robots.txt is explicitly disallowing all, then I'd expect not any file should be visible and indexed (google on site:dl.dropbox.com). Now the filenames are visible, but the content is not indexed. The original filename will show in some cases too much information. If I share a file, I want to be in control of this share, not to have it being indexed on filename.

I don't know for sure if these guys are aware that their wallets are publicly available. All dropbox files are publicly downloadable, but it is hard to guess the exact url. Google indexing these files is quite an issue, because there are several ways Google gets the urls to index. And maybe even by urls shared by email. Point is that the urls are indexed, and because of the filename are easily searchable.

What is wrong with making people aware that (shared) files can be indexed and found without their explicit knowledge? I also pleated for using random filenames instead of the default wallet.dat. Don't see what is wrong with that either.

Ok, apparently you are right. I've deleted the question.
@_date: 2014-01-28 09:15:19
Ok, if you don't agree to this question. Ok, to explain why this isn't a good option. But not OK to just randomly call me a scammer, without knowing anything about me.

I warned for keeping wallets in dropbox before, that it could be dangerous, and not smart to do. Did you shared the folder or wallet.dat somehow?

Looked back at my comments, cannot find anything about truecrypt and cannot imagine I said that, because I don't agree to that statement. What I said about 
encryption is that encryption that is safe today can be broken tomorrow. Which I still agree to.

Thing is that despite the robots.txt, explicitly disallowing search engines from indexing, files are indexed by filenames. Because of the original filenames, people not aware of this can unwantedly expose files and data. This is an issue for wallet.dats, but also for other types of files.
@_date: 2014-01-15 09:37:56
Agreed, but some guys think the cloud is a safe backup for even unencrypted wallets.

Encryption unbreakable today, doesn't mean it will be unbreakable tomorrow. NSA knows flaws for several encryption techniques, which can be public tomorrow.

Thanks. Removed the question. Just wanted to buy some coins without all the hassle and all extra costs.

Google Drive isn't using the original filename, so you won't find it when searching for wallet.dat, even when it is indexed.

This dutch company also allows buying valuable articles of multiple corporate publishers and independent authors with Bitcoins &amp; pay by sharing at facebook, linkedin or twitter (tweet-to-read). Believe they are launching an English version soon.
