I seriously hope you aren't actually all in. Investing in cryptocurrencies is not the same as investing in blockchain technology. And even if it was, you should never have all your eggs in one basket. And I say this as someone with both weed stocks and crypto holdings.

I want to say that returns on the stock market are not at all "bullshit." Not quite sure why you think that, but crypto has probably distorted your sense of what reasonable gains are. Compounded over many years, stock market returns are quite lucrative. In my family, my parents worked reasonable but not crazy high paying jobs. However, they invested in stocks all their life and are multimillionares living very comfortably in their retirement. I thought I'd say this so you don't completely disregard stocks.

There are no fundamentals pointing to a "nasty correction." No offense, but generally people with no understanding of the market think that there will be a massive correction solely due to the length of the current bull market, and nothing else. There may be small corrections once in a while (and what happened recently is nothing more than a small correction) as this is healthy and normal. Nothing is indicating any sort of bear market on the horizon. Most people who try to time the market fail. 
If anything, crypto is in a "nasty correction" far moreso than the stock market.

Fair. I also live in Canada, so student loan debt isn't much of a thing up here, so my situation won't apply to everyone.

Try finding a discount brokerage. Not all places have absurdly high fees. For example, Questrade in Canada has extremely low commission ETF purchases (exact amount depends on number of shares, but usually when I buy it's about 10 cents in fees)

I wouldn't be so sure. With all the hype surrounding them, I think there could be another run up before legalization. That said, it is certainly not without risk.

What are you talking about exactly? Of course you can withdraw. Sell the stock and withdraw your money. Or do you mean withdrawing the stocks themselves? You can easily transfer them between institutions.

Fair, this is true. I also live in Canada, so I have no debt from university and my situation won't apply to everyone.
