Hi, I'm the OP. I haven't been checking the thead here regularly so I didn't notice the email request from However, I can provide a "resolution" - moolah has still not deposited the funds, and I've given up on ever getting them back.

Someone on IRC specifically requested it, and it's an option for buying/selling, so I figured no harm in adding it

I've never been able to get anyone to reply in the chat boxes. I'll post screenshots

Also, I had the same experience as you before I actually wanted my money. They were very quick to respond to inquiries about withdrawals until it came time to actually process the withdrawal and send money.

&lt;Shrug&gt; It's been 3 weeks. I'll believe it when I see the money in my account

I started compiling this because so many exchanges require you to sign up and then go digging for real information on their fee structure. I hope it's useful to some others.

Thanks, added!

Looking forward to the withdrawal being processed. Haven't seen any update on the ticket yet.
@_date: 2014-05-28 18:24:05
You can see my bank info in the ticket. It's a large bank.

Yeah I haven't heard anything since the replies you see in the screenshots. I don't think someone beat me - as you can see in the screenshot Moolah acknowledges that it's a problem.

So what's the plan for getting the withdrawal completed?
@_date: 2014-04-19 17:25:54
Yeah, I plan to add the btc fees soon

Reddit folks, I'm at Hehmeyer Trading + Investments, one of the firms represented in the article. We're actively seeking a couple of engineers (C++ / Python) to help build out our crypto infrastructure. Chicago-based, relo available. Message me if you're interested.

Crypto is a major exception to the general trend of vol collapsing, volumes declining, and competition becoming hyper-intense (although I'm sure that competition will eventually get difficult here too). HTI (and myself personally) have traditionally been futures traders rather than equity. The market structure here is very different, and there are a lot of things related to back-office management and counterparty risk that are unique. 
BTW if anyone is looking to start a crypto-related business, I think there are lots of opportunities to create products around enterprise-level back-office and accounting.

While I recognize that this may be somewhat ironic, we are not actually paying in BTC.

Very unlikely but not completely impossible. Strong preference for those willing to relo to Chicago (or already here)

Chicago (along with NY) has traditionally been a central location for a lot of HFT and futures trading because of the CME. It's less a conscious choice to locate in Chicago, and more of "a lot of people who do trading are already in Chicago."
