Ok i understand, that makes sense.. But if basic technical analysis is too nerdy for you, do not try to understand price predictions :)) You have 2 exact options; Whether you buy and hodl it for at least 2 years or you stay away from it.. Its your call

Good luck. lol

Do some research then, maybe you will understand. Search hint; "market cycle".. Term has been around for nearly 100 years.. 
@_date: 2018-05-02 15:47:54
There is also mathematical expression of this cycle, which is called;
"A logarithmic chart on a weekly time frame for BTCUSD pair"
@_date: 2018-05-02 16:08:44
Trading since 2013 and logarithmic chart on weekly TF is damn nerdy? I didnt get the joke. Forgive me, i took it serious.

It was $2K in May 2017.  lol

Midterm 'the value of Bitcoin' and long term 'Bitcoin is the value'.. Thats when i hodl until
@_date: 2018-03-17 19:25:38
Thats also wise. As long as you can catch the exact bottom

@_date: 2018-03-17 19:28:34
You are lucky then. Enjoy the ride! 
@_date: 2018-03-17 19:16:06

Any prisoner should not be released from jail then? What you say is bulllshit.

Check waves wallet. Seems like a solid one

Want a real answer? I am drunk and love Bitcoin so much..
@_date: 2018-03-17 19:23:09
I am loading my bag with BTC, ETH and AION
@_date: 2018-03-17 18:42:07
Sorry to hear that. I always consider cryptos for long term investments (shorter than decades)  If you need life saving profit in months, it may not be the right asset. You may try poker instead 
@_date: 2018-02-16 17:46:57
Thank god. Its a sign bitcoin is still not main stream and there are lots of money to pour in out there. A nice motivation to fbd
@_date: 2018-04-22 13:44:40
Agree. What i am trying to say is if not backed with a solid TA knowledge, the most first profitable trades of a beginner poses risk for his/her future trades
@_date: 2018-04-22 13:40:22
No one knows. When it comes to short trading, especially with BTC you need to at least be advanced in TA
@_date: 2018-04-22 14:12:36
Btw i am also a hodler ��
