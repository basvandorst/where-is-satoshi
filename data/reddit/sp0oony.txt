Said the millions of people with worthless shares in dead companies filling for bankruptcy.

If you never sell it it's close to worthless. Unless you're going to shop exclusively at the relatively few locations that accept it.

I mean, the same could be said for the people who bought at $500, or anything really.

Buffet refuses to split his stock because he doesn't want idiots gambling on it. The reason the value is so high is because there is so few shares. It's the opposite of a bubble, as he has completely removed any potential for speculation.

No one knows how far it'll drop, and no one knows how far it'll recover, or if it will. If anyone tells you they do they're lying.

It's a simple market correction, the point it reached was beyond what the market believes it's worth. It's caused by people selling when they think it's peaked, the large influx of sales lowers the value which causes more people to sell reading a crash. The price will continue to fall until it reached the reverse point when people think buying it is a good deal. 
What we saw over the past weak was a bubble, this is that bubble popping. This isn't to say that this is the end of Bitcoin or anything though, or that a new bubble won't happen.

I see it as a step back in many ways, and a step forward in some ways. 
The idea of going back to what basically is a gold standard is ridiculous. The inflexibility of a currency with a limited supply is stupid, there is a reason we moved a way from it in the first place. I do however see the benefit of blockchain's security. 
I see crypto being useful in conjunction with fiat, replacing it though? Not a chance, especially not bitcoin.

Congratulations! You now understand the point of inflation.
