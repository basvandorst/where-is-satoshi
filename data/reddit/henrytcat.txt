Some volatility with very high prices will mean it stabilizes. Nobody cares if the price goes up or down $1000 if it's at $1,000,000. 
I mean, did you ever think about the fact that 21 million coins is not enough to replace the world's money supply unless the price per coin is astronomical? I think Satoshi intended it, or they at least knew it was likely.

We don't give financial advice. You have to decide what's right for you. 
If you are in a good financial position with low or no debt, sizable savings (like a 3-6 month emergency fund minimum) that's a good start. 
If you decide to invest then a good rule of thumb is *don't buy more than you can afford to lose*. Bitcoin is highly speculative. It could all go under tomorrow.

There are YouTube videos that show you how as well as instructions from the hardware wallet company. It's done the same way you do any bitcoin transaction, by sending money to a wallet address. The wallet address of your hardware wallet is generated by the hardware wallet you own and only you have the keys to it. You send the Bitcoin to your wallet's address, very carefully. It's the kind of thing where you double check that address frontwards, backwards, in groups of twos, threes, and gives, check capital letters and smalls, and generally be very paranoid. :)

It's because hardly any of the world's wealth is in Bitcoin. Gold has a $7 trillion market cap; Bitcoin had its best year ever at $600 billion. So it has to go up 14x in value to even have the same valuation as gold. 
Smarter people than me have done all this math, and if bitcoin takes off, it is possible it will REALLY REALLY take off.

Bitcoin is software. When you buy Bitcoin, you get/buy a private key that controls it. 
The device used to store your private key is called a wallet. A wallet also generates public keys so you can receive bitcoin. 
If you store your keys on a computer (DON'T) or a mobile phone (ok for small amounts) that's connected to the internet, your bitcoin is as vulnerable as your internet security. Those are "hot" wallets/storage. 
If you store keys offline on a dedicated device like a Ledger or Trezor, you add another layer of security because it isn't connected to the internet. That's cold storage. 
Exchanges probably don't actually assign private keys to users, you just own part of their on-hand bitcoin. You can see why this is risky. 
But, you can *really* mess up your wallet or storage by not knowing what you are doing, so please please be careful and learn before you do anything with them. Coinbase is generally safe, although nobody recommends it for long-term storage.

If you watch Andreas' recent YouTube video where he talks about *authority* and how people look for it...bitcoin is anti-authority. 
I feel like every time bitcoin reestablishes itself as a messy, glorious, chaotic, organic thing apart from any one control or influence, this reinforces that it's about what happens when there *is* no authority. 
I have also wondered about the fourth turning. According to the book we entered one around 2008. That financial crisis inspired Bitcoin. We have another ten years before the next turn. 
Deep crisis, though. I don't think people realize what a crisis it will be for the work if bitcoin does what it is designed to do.

The advantage is that you own your private key. Coinbase will give you the amount you own when you request it, but as far as I know your coins aren't on the blockchain - you just own part of CB's pool. 
Putting them on a software wallet means they are yours. Your public key is like your email address where you retrieve mail. Your private key is like your email password, how you receive mail. The seed words are like the questions about your high school mascot - your recovery. Don't ever lose them. Get a Segwit wallet and use GDAX to transfer out your coins. You'll be happier.

[Here's ]( a good primer on the difficulty adjustment. In addition to that (which made it less profitable to mine Bitcoin temporarily), Bitcoin Cash advocates were spamming the network and trying their idiotic Dragonslayer thing again.
In addition to that, Coinbase doesn't use Segwit and is expensive already, and got more so. 
In addition to THAT, Coinbase shut down trades because it couldn't handle transaction volume. 
It was a perfect storm of ineptitude. It's probably another good reason to just HODL and don't try to sell when the network is going bonkers.

Here's what looks fishy. Coinbase said they were going to support BCH in January. Yesterday there was a difficulty adjustment and a huge BCH rally - most likely pumpers pumping up the price artificially to make a ton of money and (they hope) detract from BTC. And Coinbase decided to support BCH early, in the middle of this huge rally. 
As far as I can tell, CB dumped this in and CB customers thought it was an actual rally and bought, which made the price go wayyyy high. These buyers will be left with a loss when the price corrects itself. 
This caused enough trouble for CB that they suspended buying and selling BCH. 
Or, credible sources think the BCH rally may have been triggered by knowledge of Coinbase's secret plan to launch BCH support early. This is essentially a form of insider trading because CB is contributing price information to the futures market. The SEC moves slowly, so penalties aren't likely - but possible. 
Coinbase may be in grave danger because of this. Whether it was complicit or a BCH pawn, there will be PR repercussions and possibly lawsuits. 
Incidentally, money in the futures market likely prevented BTC from crashing yesterday. A lot of people think we can credit Wall Street for BCH's failure to manipulate the BTC market. 
Anyway.

One of Coinbase's employees may have personally benefited by leaking info, causing the rally, and benefiting from the huge price increase. 
The timing is off because it happened during a difficulty adjustment... basically miners leave off BTC because it's more profitable to mine BCH. Maybe CB expected that more miners on BCH would help them; most people expect that large amounts of CB users will sell their BCH for Bitcoin. 
I'd like to know also why they halted trading. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 15:14:45
I am pretty sure - and investigate this before you do it - you can send BCH to Shapeshift or Changelly and convert to BTC and send it back to GDAX.

Not at all. You can add to it whenever, but it's safer to generate a new public key each time when you are adding to it.

Mining blocks happens when transactions are completed and added to the blockchain. Miners collect transaction fees for processing transactions. 
The reward for mining blocks is Bitcoin. When all the Bitcoin has been mined, miners will make their fees handling transactions. So they will still mine blocks, but get paid only in transaction fees.

Statement analysis applied to Satoshi and Hal Finney reveals some interesting things.
"I'm comfortable" is interesting coming from someone with a fatal disease. And like you said "I'm comfortable with how it all turned out" might be what he was saying 
"I've moved on to other things" is an interesting choice of phrase for why Satoshi dropped Bitcoin, especially if it was coming from a fellow with ALS. 
Interesting that he stressed the contrast between Satoshi as young but refers to himself as a "graybeard." Most people stress similarities with people they admire, not differences. This could be adding disinformation. 
Interesting also is the time gap where Hal comes back to bitcoin. SA people would say time gaps hide sensitive or important info. It may be that he gave up Satoshi's coins but kept Hal's. 
Probably nothing but an interesting thought experiment. If you believe people are telling you the truth and you just need to listen to what they actually say and not fill in any blanks for them...a few things are in here I would have liked to ask Hal about.

No, it's what lots of people are calling it to avoid confusion with the actual Bitcoin name, because they are not Bitcoin. I've seen it on Twitter and YouTube and haven't even looked that much.

This has to do with how the blockchain works. It's essentially a record of Bitcoin transactions, right? And, the way things are entered in the blockchain contains information about when each transaction occurred. So they can tell how much BTC you had at the time of the split because they took the same blockchain BTC uses and started adding their own blocks to it. So the guy who says same history / different future gave the best analogy - I'm just saying why. The blockchain they split from BTC contains the info, so they don't need to collaborate with Bitcoin to determine who they want to give their alt-coin to. They picked a point in time and all transactions up to that point were awarded bcash.

You already have BCash, as long as you had your Bitcoin when the fork happened. You don't need to do anything to get it, but like everyone says, it's worth following steps to put it in a separate wallet. Just scroll up for lots of resources on that. 
@_date: 2017-08-29 12:01:01
My question about that (as a devil's advocate) is how many average people are going to even know to do something like this?
To me personally the scaling problem has as much to do with increasing ease of use as it does with low transaction fees and faster transactions. It won't scale if my 70-ish parents have to figure out what the hell a SegWit2-capable wallet is.

Girl here, go girl! :)

The BCash name is useful to *us* to distinguish it from actual bitcoin. The value lies in the distinction (if there is value). 
To Roger Ver, the "bitcoin" part has to be included because that's how he's making money. His fine print about how it's *actually* bitcoin cash isn't fooling anyone. The value for *him* lies in trying to replace actual bitcoin. So he wants people to get used to calling his-coin, bitcoin. Sorry, fella. 
The video was funny. Nothing like a toddler meltdown to cheer up your Monday.

If he did HODL as energetically as he said, he's probably a wealthy dude now.?

It's a store of value. Altcoins don't have the same prices, so they aren't as much a store of value. Use them to get more BTC. 
Remember, Bitcoin is by design *deflationary.* Holding in to it generally makes you money against the dollar. Until the price stabilizes, probably much higher than it is now, it's not great as currency. But i think it will be.

@_date: 2017-09-18 16:12:29
Thanks for a thoughtful reply and I appreciate that these things just don't make sense to you. 
Ok, so this is actually exactly where I was going with the holiness bit I mentioned above. God's omnibenevolence as seen in scripture is essentially a theological construct - in other words, God doesn't call Himself this, but we glean it from scripture. 
When I say God's primary attribute is holiness, I mean it is in fact the overarching thing He has *declared himself* to be. So this is an overarching quality to any theological constructs. It defines all His other characteristics. If he is just, it is a holy justice. If loving, His love is holy - not unlimited (He doesn't love evil acts, for instance). If He has anger, it's a holy, righteous anger - not anger for its own sake. 
When I say holy, I mean the Bible definition of it - set apart. God is known to us because He *is* like us, but also sometimes because He is *unlike* us. This is one of those cases. In the OT, there were items of furniture in the temple that were called Holy to the Lord...they weren't better furniture. They were simply set aside for the temple use only. 
What this means is that all of God's actions must be seen through that initial lens of holiness. Differentness. Aboveness. But before you say that makes him even harder to understand - you are His creation. What does He owe you? What standard of your invention is He obligated to live up to? A Christian would say that *we* are obligated to change our view of God to fit with what He says about Himself, not what we wish He was. The idea is to understand God on God's terms. If you can't do that - if you can't let go of your terms - then you know what the issue here is. 
Now I bet you are wondering how suffering plays into all of this?
@_date: 2017-09-17 16:56:31
Heh, boy this is some real freshman-level polemics, complete with logical fallacies. God's primary attribute is not goodness or powerfulness. Your first argument is based on a God of your own imagination - that if He doesn't live up to your standards, he must be wrong. Good luck with such basic ideas about religion and God. I'd go on but I'd be speaking over your head. 
@_date: 2017-09-02 00:48:39
Of course you were. I need a Remind Me for when you're 48...I can probably predict that conversation. :)
@_date: 2017-09-22 01:16:20
Well again, as I said — just because God *can* do something doesn't mean he *does*. 
My feeling about suffering is that it happens to everyone and we can't control it, but if we belong to God we have much more to rely on that someone who doesn't and is therefore alone.
For me it's never been a question of "why doesn't God prevent that" because of course He doesn't. But because I follow Him, I have His strength, sovereignty and mercy to rely on when those bad things do happen. 
Lots of people have written lots of words about how God has a higher purpose in our suffering. I would say...maybe. It's more likely that He uses our suffering for good, as He used Jesus' suffering to save His people. In my experience this has been something only God can do. 
I know I'm a bit more philosophical than theological in this part. Ultimately, this is about having correct presuppositions. If you believe God is obligated to you, then you will naturally be upset when He allows something to happen that you don't like. But if you believe God has a greater plan for everything that you are only a small part of, you will understand more that He is able to make His will happen even when outright evil is right there alongside of me. 
When I say His holiness is His primary attribute and this defines everything else He does, that is what I am talking about. 
The law of microwaves is that they break. The law of human bodies is that they die. We who hope for this life alone are to be pitied more than all men. 
@_date: 2017-09-17 17:22:59
Ok, you've proven yourself to be far too narrow-minded for it, so I won't bother. 
@_date: 2017-09-01 02:20:28
@_date: 2017-09-17 17:57:58
Really? Well first of all you have God's primary attributes wrong. You assume that to be God, he would have to be all-powerful or all-loving. 
Yet it's self-evident in the book about Him that describes His nature that neither of those are true: He hates His enemies, and there are many times in scripture He could intervene on behalf of someone (for instance, when Jesus was crucified) but He didn't. 
So the enemies thing you espouse is clearly and self-evidently false, and the power thing assumes God's display of power and might is most important. In other words, you assume that because God *can* do something, He *must.* 
That is clearly not true, and if you are the kind who attributes human qualities to God, you will also find it is not true that way - humans do not do everything they are capable of. 
So the problem with that argument is you expect something of God He does not show Himself to be. Your idea that only *your* idea of God is acceptable is simply what's called total depravity in action. You're too blind to see God for who He is, so you set up straw men to show He is not God. That would be a second logical fallacy. 
Now onto the crucifixion of Jesus. Scripture (which I assume you are familiar with, since only a fool would dispute something he knows nothing about) clearly says He died for many - that is, He died for the forgiveness of sins, and that was a meaningful and important death. It would be easy to assume God was a "sadistic asshole" if you don't really grasp the reason why He did this. 
But two takeaways: 1) the penalty for sin is severe, and when you are judged for your sin, God will indeed seem like that to you; and 2) if God chose to judge His Son in your place - who did not have total depravity, original sin, and was not guilty - the God genuinely wants you for His own, because the price He paid was extreme. 
And that primary attribute? It's not love. It's not power. It's not pleasing you or making your life grand. It's holiness. If you would additionally like a discussion of that, let me know - but I understand, not everyone is a theologian at heart. 
Peace.

Hi, you can 'oh please,' but it would be great if you asked what I actually meant by it instead of assuming the worst possible meaning behind what i said.
Maybe you don't agree with this (and that is ok with me) but I see victimhood as one of the best ways ever to give people power over you. 
Additionally, I think most jokes are good-natured and goofy. I think you can equally read this as "I'm a nerd, my wife has no idea about Bitcoin."
But - assuming you don't. Assume the guy really *does* mean "women are stupid idiots." Why do you give a rat's ass about what a douchey, stupid, unfunny, crap person like this thinks? 
You won't change his mind. He probably isn't able to care that he hurt your feelings (or doesn't want to). And, he's a *stranger.* Do you want to expend emotional energy being upset that he said something offensive? I don't. 
I reread your post and I can understand how it probably looked like my comment was combative or lecturey. I was actually replying to the guy above me, and riffing on an old joke from Conan with Triumph the Comic Dog, where he was talking about "bitches" - he said "I've been a dog all my life and I still think that's funny." It was meant to be a bit of social commentary of my own, probably nobody got it. 
I understand what you're saying but I am not the enemy here. I refuse to let jerky asshats define my personal happiness or offend me. You can choose a different path than that, and I am ok with it - but please don't assume that you know why I didn't take offense or that I'm complicit in being part of the problem of men offending women and then yelling "I was kidding"! I am not. I am someone who tells people in person what they said wasn't cool.
And a bit of background - husband is a bitcoin guy, I'm here because I'm trying to learn - so yes, personally I *did* find that funny, not because I think I'm stupid, but because I actually *don't* want this to happen to me. 
So...peace.
