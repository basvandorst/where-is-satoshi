insurance handling is somewhat similar to current bitcoin casinos, both allow to bet on probabilities.

Coinbase is not an exchange (in context of trading bots).
In my view use of a trading bot assumes that you may freely place buy and sell orders at different prices with minimal delays and your money stays on exchange.
This is not the case with Coinbase. On Coinbase the sell means money goes to your bank (several days delay).
Coinbase is a broker, middleman between you and the real exchange (mostly Bitstamp and also some other exchanges).

I'm unable to find the reference, but I remember reading that both sender and receiver clients will periodically retransmit unconfirmed transaction.
So as long as receiver's client is online, it should refresh nodes' memory about this concrete transaction.

let's check, current coinbase price $813, current metabank.ru price $808 (btc-e referenced), plus 4% fee for qiwi -&gt; metabank. Entry to qiwi is zero fee. So in total not much difference (though roubles to dollars conversion may add a bit)
yes, 4% is worse than 1% on coinbase, but in my case no verification steps required

that is what physical reality is. Bitcoin network is going to be better in future (more transactions per second) but until then, the transaction fee is the only thing that protects bitcoin network from denial of service attack (large number of dust transactions that will overload the system completely).

@_date: 2014-01-24 18:21:10

@_date: 2015-05-12 10:58:29
2013 run-up was speculative driven (by known Japanese site, supported by a few Chinese sites). Main trading activity then happened on those sites, hence transaction rate was little affected.
Also at the time there was a fight against dust transactions, so I guess significant part of real transactions just occupied the place which was used before by dust transactions.

This problem is external to Bitcoin, some countries (like USA) want to have control over money flows ("know your customer" law, anti - money laundering laws, etc). tldr - say thanks to your government for this.

yes, the probable outcome is that a bit higher fee will be needed to get transaction through, and all this spam will linger in the system (eating all block space left from normal transactions), so 30 days backlog would mean nothing if this is backlog for spam transactions only.

maybe today all can be done remotely, i was just under impression when you come to see people personally, the business goes faster, but maybe mtgox does not have a big office.
Bitstamp is other good exchange
@_date: 2013-12-21 11:04:33
yes, but looks like after a few days the network may forget about first transaction (under certain conditions) and the second one will win:
so it looks mostly a theoretical attack now, as the bitcoin network currently works fast for zero fee transactions (may not be so in future)
@_date: 2013-11-27 17:38:37
while you wait two months for e.g. euros to be delivered from mtgox, bitcoin may rise +50%, and while you got something on arbitrage,  you may lost big on bitcoin
Edit: arbitrage may be better suited for stable market, but then the difference between exchanges will be small
@_date: 2013-11-25 14:41:38
in bitcoin-qt there is a pool of pregenerated private keys of about 100, so i guess after about 100 transactions the old backup file will become obsolete (the private key for 101 transaction will not be in old wallet).
Just to be safe, i would suggest to backup after a few transactions

as i see it, anything below recommended fee is treated in the same way as zero fee (it shares a small subset of the block with zero-fee transactions), I quote:
Then transactions that pay a fee of at least 0.0001 BTC/kb are added to the block, highest-fee transactions first, until the block is not more than 250,000 bytes big.
The remaining transactions remain in the miner's "memory pool", and may be included in later blocks if their priority or fee is large enough.
Also quote:
There is only a limited area for these fee-free transactions in a block - 27kB of 250kB. This may create scenarios whereby, depending on network utilization, free transactions may be processed faster than fee-paying ones, or fee-free transactions languish waiting for free space. The implication of such automatic no-fee transactions is not presented to users when creating transactions.

main gox problem is withdrawal of dollars/euro, direct btc withdrawal should be fine (though some on this forum claim that even small amounts of btc withdrawal require verification).
Quote from MtGox withdrawal FAQ:
Europe/SEPA Transfers (EUR)
* Withdrawals
All withdrawals will be sent through the Mt. Gox Polish bank account and will involve a 1% fee with a minimum of 5.5 PLN
Please note the following rules :
- It is not possible to withdraw less than 10 EUR.
- Withdraws lower than 100.00 EUR are on average take less than a week.
- It takes at least a month on average for withdrawals larger than 10,000 EUR
- Withdrawals greater than 50,000 EUR need to be split it into multiple transfers or you can use the International Wire payment method.
- Due to the volume of withdrawals requests, each customer is currently only allowed **1 withdrawal every 20 days** (estimate)
 Situation as of 24 November 2013: We are currently processing withdrawals requested **five weeks ago**.

yes, this will make transactions more efficient, and also this will make litecoin more attractive, because one bitcoin block generation may already take up to an hour (which is rare, but possible, I have seen this one myself), if we add to this fee related delays it may became too long to ignore

Foreign Exchange Regulations
The Chinese Government, through the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE), regulates all international payments. Chinese importers must satisfy specific requirements before they can transfer the money out of China. Only Chinese companies with a business licence that allows them to conduct import/export businesses can transfer money out of China (although there is some suggestion that this limitation will be lifted in the near future). Before funds can be transferred overseas, Chinese importers must present to their banks all required documentation such as a complete set of shipping documents, Customs declaration forms and other documents required by SAFE.

no, the normal exchanges convert to/from btc immediately at the time of trade (only coinbase may offer something like you describe, their feature of "our buy limits exceeded, but you may buy later etc").

it happens just at the moment of sending btc, there is a line item which can be ticked off (it describes the fee)
@_date: 2013-12-12 21:39:30
mtgox has significant trade fee (starting from 0.6%), maybe the highest fee between big exchanges, coupled with inability to withdraw usd in timely manner
I guess they (mtgox) are still living in the past, where gox has had 80% of btc trades
Moreover, this fee schedule is based on btc, so now with high rise in btc valuation, it requires ridiculous trade volume of 500-1000 btc per month just to get 0.5% fee. 
@_date: 2013-12-10 20:37:31

@_date: 2013-11-25 10:04:52
What does 'unconfirmed' means? 
It means that the transaction has not yet been included in the blockchain, and is still reversible. A transaction typically takes around 10 minutes to be confirmed. When that happens, it is said that one confirmation has occurred for the transaction. With each subsequent block that is found, the number of confirmations is increased by one. To protect against double spending, a transaction should not be considered as confirmed until a certain number of confirmations is seen. 
@_date: 2013-12-16 19:30:23
I don't know, but if I would, I would use  it has 15min average (MA or EMA)

Yes, I was reliant on this feature before, but the latest version of bitcoin-qt happily skipped "mandatory fee" step, see transaction:
It was in limbo about 10 hours (as can be seen on blockchain.info page)

@_date: 2013-12-11 09:06:08
the question here is the volume, the volume is the context, and the volume mainly depends on transaction fee (which btcchina has none)
The withdrawal fee is only secondary here (it may reduce or increase total amount of money on exchange, that is, it may attract or not a new clients with money).
@_date: 2013-12-05 20:05:33
if you go through your link, the blockchain info will tell you that this address with 144K coins is "DPR seized coins" and belongs to FBI

second payment may be a change which goes back to your wallet (on another your address).
@_date: 2013-12-11 08:51:19
the end game is that all your savings are in bitcoin (or equivalent digital currency).
You only "cash-out" a little about once a week to have cash for weekly purchases of groceries (or to have a little money on debit card, for same groceries).
This way, your transaction time is fixed and always visible via blockchain.info to any place on the globe. No inter-bank transfers, no red flags, ability to send 24/7 from your home, etc
You say dollars transfer is simple? For real life example see mtgox, how about waiting a month for usd withdrawal from gox?

I guess they reduced this task to the task of securing a computer with the wallet (or several computers in different locations). Like access to the room for at least two people only or something.
Edit: but yes, several paper wallets looks best (to store in a safe)
@_date: 2013-11-29 16:55:15
he said that he stored private keys separately, it seems that he is talking not about paper wallet content.

A cryptographic signature is a mathematical mechanism that allows someone to prove ownership. In the case of Bitcoin, a Bitcoin wallet and its private key(s) are linked by some mathematical magic. When your Bitcoin software signs a transaction with the appropriate private key, the whole network can see that the signature matches the bitcoins being spent. However, there is no way for the world to guess your private key to steal your hard-earned bitcoins.

Many here think that your usage of single address reduces their anonymity (in case when your address is linked via transaction to theirs).

I mean the competition between miners will drive the mining difficulty up until electricity cost will be a main factor in miner's expenses

get the last version of bitcoin-qt, give it a copy of wallet.dat and sync
@_date: 2013-11-24 12:19:14
this transaction is now visible on blockchain, some strange delay it was
@_date: 2013-11-25 09:24:56
current recommended fee is 0.0001, mtgox should lower its fee (but there was a possibility in mtgox interface to decline the fee, i myself recently sent btc from mtgox without fee)
@_date: 2013-11-30 09:20:33
as they have enough btc to fill all outstanding bids, what price will be when there no bids left?

yes, actually my company already does payroll tax calculation/deduction automatically

well, theoretically, in case of unconfirmed transaction with zero fee, it may be possible to double-spend it, or to remove transaction altogether:

i'm not sure they want to control everything, but control over national currency may be important for chinese leaders.

from google translation i see a strict regulation over prepaid cards: "earnestly to ensure that real-name registration card purchase, non-cash card purchase, limit the amount of a single card issuance, invoice management, strict regulatory requirements in place, legal compliance management"

well, flash is transistors too. It is leading node, problems with this node may signal problems for other nodes (regardless of transistor type), at 10nm there is not much atoms left in the gate
@_date: 2013-12-18 17:48:06
china export controls on currency are incompatible with bitcoin. Either preventive measures against bitcoin, or lost control over money moving through china borders
@_date: 2013-11-23 21:06:26
there are hardware variants which may simplify wallet management (e.g. trezor)
@_date: 2013-12-18 22:22:59
you could just say that the regulation from china government was the reason for the current bad time

lol, printing U.S. dollars is easier than investing in bitcoin:
from this angle, bitcoin is a threat for north korea. They print dollars, but they would be unable to counterfeit bitcoin.

according to wiki in 2009 annual popualtion grown rate was 1.1%. Current btc inflation is about 10%, in four years it will be about 5%, in eight years about 2%. Somewhere after 12-16 years we may reach parity.
@_date: 2013-12-05 22:13:24
why would this be wrong, I did something similar in the past (directly from bitstamp to mtgox). The transaction should appear immediately on blockchain (initially as unconfirmed)
@_date: 2013-11-29 21:07:11
bitcoin is open source, so if you have some ideas about how it could be improved, you may even start your own coin (taking a copy of bitcoin code and making your improvements).

@_date: 2013-11-29 22:42:48
it does not look as insufficient fee, the transaction size is 2K and the fee is 0.0002, it matches recommended fee of 0.0001 (per kilobyte).

the OP was vocal recently about checking the links and posts, maybe some ground info about this information would be helpful from OP?

is there a file debug.log? (in the same directory as wallet.dat), maybe it has more info
@_date: 2013-11-24 09:43:02
you can always check your current btc balance on blockchain.info, search for your address there

the owner of the address has private key for this address (which allows to move money from this address, that is, to initiate transaction from it)

I guess they will take it seriously after the first denial of service attack:

Main reward for miners today is fixed 25btc.
I would say, let's first to demonstrate how high bitcoin network can grow (that is, show me how fast you can run) and only after that the fees may be gradually increased (when it will be obvious for all what are we paying for, when bitcoin becomes useful for sizeable portion of population).
@_date: 2013-11-28 15:28:54
I guess they will sell it on auction, and only after DPR case will reach its end (not soon). Private investors may buy it out on auction so it may not reach an exchange
@_date: 2013-12-31 16:30:06
This is common way of writing science papers. Also Satoshi based his work on the works of Nick Szabo, so I guess that "we" inclides Nick.
@_date: 2013-12-01 16:58:23
the transaction fee currently serves as a saveguard against denial-of-service attack.
In case of zero fees malicious agent theoretically may generate e.g. 100K of legal transactions which will overload bitcoin network.

This very much depends on the vanity generator program that you are using.
If someone in future finds a problem with your vanity generator (that is, a problem with its random number generator) then your vanity address is in danger (because that someone will try to break all existing vanity addresses looking for the ones generated by this particular program).

Characteristics of Ponzi scheme
Typically, extraordinary returns are promised on the original investment[5] and vague verbal constructions such as "hedge futures trading", "high-yield investment programs", or "offshore investment" might be used. The promoter sells shares to investors by taking advantage of a **lack of investor knowledge or competence**, or using **claims of a proprietary investment strategy which must be kept secret** to ensure a competitive edge.
Bitcoin does not fit this profile at all, it counts on knowledgeable investors and have no secrets in its structure.
@_date: 2013-12-05 14:42:17

you will still have control over your address, just it will be empty (because  someone else moved btc out of it)
@_date: 2013-11-25 14:57:59
yes, you are right, new private key will be used when a new address is used (for sending or receiving), if someone always receives to the same address then maybe private key is not used.
From the other side, sending out usually generates change which will be placed to the new address (and new private key used)
@_date: 2013-11-24 14:13:04
if someone has acces to your wallet, then he may transfer wallet funds to another address which you have no control of. The backup will be obsolete then.
