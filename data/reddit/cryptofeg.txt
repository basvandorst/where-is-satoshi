idk lets see if we break 7800 after this dip maybe bitcoin really is a unicorn. last June btc had the same correction on a smaller scale and it broke out to bull run.

then wave E will just be death of crypto ??? or you think we still in the euphoria stage and we bounce from 3900 to 15k then die.. im pretty much at the point of if wave D doesn't hold ill be taking my inflated fiat elsewhere

ok but in order for mass adoption they would need to sell some of that 40% how can you have mass adoption if the majority of people have no bitcoin or even decimal places??? it can't moon with no new money it sounds lame but you have to hold if you actually believe this is possible it can't hold its market cap because it doesn't have the money in it to hold it

I know bitcoins been weak af but im optimistic it could break out on wave D, like if btc goes to any lower than 4k who's really gonna buy it thinking it can get back to 20k anytime soon and even if it does would it hold? I know in the past it had worse corrections but the market cap was so much smaller and bitcoin was an underground thing, its on the news now and everyone is gonna bash the hell out of it if it sinks that low imo. if investors don't like bitcoin at 5k how are investors gonna like it at 20k
