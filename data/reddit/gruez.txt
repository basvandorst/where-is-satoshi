yes, it does. bigger blocks = higher orphan rates. you don't get the block reward from orphaned blocks, so every transaction you include is indirectly reducing your block reward (on average).

the main selling point of large blocks is low fees. if bitcoin also has low fees, then there goes most of their value proposition.

from the exchange's point of view, the interface is the same. get address, get notified when funds arrive at address.

...so it's "implemented", they just want proper testing for it. but to answer your initial question, the reason why it's taking a long time is that there's a lot more details you have to worry about when implementing segwit for a wallet than for an exchange, because the wallet abstracts away all the complicated bits.

when the mempool is emptier, so there's less lower transaction fees due to lower competition for space.

according to whom?
@_date: 2017-12-24 02:13:30
your wallet periodically rebroadcasts unconfirmed transactions, so it getting evicted isn't an issue.

y axis is amount of transactions in the memory pool, separated by fee amount. x axis is time. it's going down, so the mempool is clearing up.

I get how *plugins* can make your browser more unique because they can be identified via js, but how exactly can addons be identified?

you think pawn shops don't have AML/KYC laws?

because a satellite covers a huge area whereas terrestrial based jammer only covers a limited area. see: tv or cellphone towers. if you use a satellite transmitter, you'd cover your whole country, but adjacent countries as well, which would make your neighbors unhappy. finally, satellite dishes are directional, so if you get a good enough dish, it's possible to tune out the jamming satellite as long as it's not too close to the blockstream satellite.

the moral hazard is still there. dao really was "too big to fail".
@_date: 2015-08-17 05:22:22
tl;dr: the information that exchanges are required to hold can get you hacked, *if they get leaked*. article completely sidesteps the issue of the anti-money laundering aspect of KYC.

this. factor in the number of people who wouldn't sell their 10K BTC for 2M back in early 2013, or 10M in late 2013.

Did anyone here actually read the BIP? 


you're already using https to browse/checkout, so I don't see how this is a problem. also, you're conflating TLS/SSL (where the vulnerabilities described are in) and x509 certificates, which is what BIP70 uses.


no justification provided.
@_date: 2018-03-04 21:18:58
it's not because there are more outputs *per se*, it's that inputs are significantly bigger than outputs (148 bytes for a standard input vs 34 bytes for a standard output). so it makes sense to get as much use out of a input as possible, which is accomplished by batching transactions.
@_date: 2018-03-06 19:34:42
That's a false equivalency. Imperfect QA != inadequate QA, the latter of which is implied.

You'd have to somehow adjust for premined coins that have $x market cap on paper, but only $x/1000 market cap in reality due to 99.9% premine.

money clearly isn't the issue here. the "real registrars" are actually cheaper than AnonymousSpeech. I'm guessing theymos chose AnonymousSpeech for its resistance to DMCA/takedown notices.

transactions does not imply volume. it could be tons of 0.01 BTC spam, not to mention the 1 satoshi that it sends back as a "loss".

I don't see how throwing money at forum security could have prevented this attack.

still down for me. can someone verify?
@_date: 2013-12-02 03:07:15
The only way this attack will work is if the attacker managed to acquire a bitcointalk.org ssl certificate. The certificate system is designed specifically to hinder MITM attacks.
