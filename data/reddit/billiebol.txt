It's recovering already.
@_date: 2018-01-16 10:58:55
Well I want to understand what is happening but I think it's prudent to just hold. We're talking about holding it for 1-2 years at least. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 19:36:53
The risk is for people "shaking the tree", I've seen this happen in stock trades. A stock is briefly tanked to trigger all the stop lossers then they get bought up and the stock soars back.
@_date: 2018-01-16 11:21:59
It's going back up now. Funny how the graphs of ALL the major coins look exactly the same..
@_date: 2018-01-16 16:51:42
See link. It is strange the graphs for all the big cryptos look identical now. They used to have their own identities and patterns. Is everything just following BTC? Or are there other explanations?
@_date: 2018-01-16 11:05:24
It's a different ball game now though, it used to be a niche market back then, now it has gone mainstream and professional investors are involved.
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:25:51
So the same people who bought the options also bought a ton of BTC and are now crashing it? Is it that "easy" to do?
@_date: 2018-01-06 18:28:17


What are you basing this on?
@_date: 2018-01-16 09:20:29
You can keep buying at the new dip every 2 days the way this is going.
@_date: 2018-01-16 11:18:04
You can manipulate the price down quite easily if you are in contact with people ("whales") who hold a lot of coins. They need to just keep putting out orders at increasingly lower prices. Once you are done and have cashed in on your shorts you/they can buy back in cheaper and see the price rise again as a result. Very profitable.
@_date: 2018-01-06 19:59:12


How do people manipulate the price downward then?
@_date: 2018-01-16 19:33:07
It's the biggest downswing in 5 years.
@_date: 2018-01-16 11:50:01
Chinese Lunar year is 16 Feb, more than a month out, this theory doesn't hold. 
@_date: 2018-01-06 19:27:08
It was more of a filosophical disagreement about the direction Bitcoin will go.
@_date: 2018-01-30 17:10:17
Not correct, every 2016 blocks.
@_date: 2018-01-16 16:39:47
Have some recommendations of ppl to follow?
@_date: 2018-01-30 20:48:02
Holy shit if the house of cards comes down.. should we start shorting bitcoin?..
@_date: 2018-01-16 23:47:55
BTC has just dropped to 11k by the expiration date. Then it dropped further to just below 10k and is now going up again.
@_date: 2018-01-16 19:20:16
That's solid advice with how volatile crypto is.
@_date: 2018-01-16 17:10:45
What I am starting to fear..
@_date: 2018-01-08 15:05:37
The difficulty isn't adjusted until 2048 blocks are mined so the network will slow down to a crawl.
@_date: 2018-01-16 19:43:55
That "wealthy group" is basically the Chinese then since they've mined by far the most BTC?
@_date: 2018-01-16 09:10:11
I'm in a triple dip already, should I keep buying?
@_date: 2018-01-21 17:01:16
What is witness data?
@_date: 2018-01-16 09:04:43
New ATH coming.
@_date: 2018-01-06 18:30:11
Isn't that exactly what the Bitcoin Cash fork did?
@_date: 2018-01-16 20:17:42
2018-2013=5 like i said
@_date: 2018-01-16 10:30:09
Yeah massive 15-20% drops across all cryptos.. insane..
@_date: 2018-01-16 10:36:34
I suspect two things, bad news and uncertainty (China, Korea) is making people stop trusting crypto and pull out. And manipulation. I'm not certain when the plunge will end..
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:57:47
It's not a short, you can't lose more than you put in while in a short you can.
@_date: 2018-01-30 19:34:42
The crypto prices didn't budge when a lot of futures expired on the 26th. Not sure anymore it is that relevant.
It is true that investors are going long on crypto though, so there's that.
@_date: 2018-01-30 21:56:10
Well not really, if you short 1 BTC at $10k and it goes down to $2k you've made $8K. I'm currently at a loss with prices tanking but if that were to happen and I shorted it, I'd be up.
@_date: 2018-01-06 18:33:13
There are thousands of altcoins, cryptos are a hype and millions of dollars are being raised to launch the new best thing, not sure what your question is.
@_date: 2018-01-16 19:52:58


So breakeven
@_date: 2018-01-16 23:51:24
The problem arises if there is a downswing in hashrate.. it could take months before the difficulty is updated again.
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:53:13
Asia just woke up, the rebound has already started. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:54:43
Already over 11k again, the sky is the limit!
@_date: 2018-01-16 20:45:04
$19 is pointless because of fees.
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:28:30
It's not the first rise of USD/EUR, even in a week.
@_date: 2018-01-16 23:55:21
Where does it say what the actual Final Settlement Day actually is?
@_date: 2018-01-06 19:15:15
Because increasing the blocks many times over will increase the block chain size on people's hard drives, if it keeps going up (to say over 1TB) this will mean only big corps will be able to host block chains and kill the decentralized aspect. 
@_date: 2018-01-30 22:18:05
What I'm afraid of. They noticed they can literally just print money.
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:23:42
Nothing, those guys are weird.
@_date: 2018-01-16 23:04:22
Tether only -0.03%, what is that superman coin?
@_date: 2018-01-17 18:06:43
No that was in 2013.
