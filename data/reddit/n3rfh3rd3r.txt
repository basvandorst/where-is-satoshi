I don't buy this at all...or the people rather.
Also that music is pretty epic.  Sounds like Men's Warehouse fitting area shit from the 90's.

no...not how this works
an address is not attached to an IP.  so when you buy something from newegg the ledger (blockchain) doesn't say "NEWEGGS BITCOIN ADDRESS" its just a random address like everyone elses.  There is a new address for every transaction for companies so they can keep track of their own invoices.


Then don't use a credit or debit card ever again.  One swipe at a machine means that company and any other company that processes payments in that system has your name, address, DOB, phone  the Credit Card info and basically everything else.
You have everything completely ass-backwards.  If you take out the word BitCoin and replace it with Debit/Credit cards then your question is actually a really good one.
Not trying to be a sycophant either.  The things you bring up are key points in why BitCoin is a thing.

No, thank you for waiting months to post any info about this even though you could have wanred people earlier.
Very convenient timing for you.  Care to explain to everyone here your REAL MOTIVATION?

I know it is not and I don't believe a single thing anyone in this community says.
You are just as likely to lie as they are.  I got no clue who the fuck you or anyone else really is.
It's all a joke and a game and you are trying to play people somehow.
