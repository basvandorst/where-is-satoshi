I'm not saying they are remotely the same thing longer term, on that I totally agree. I was pointing out though that they have a strong overlap in the type of traders/investors, and their moves have had a clear relationship. Since last year they haven't just decoupled, because when bitcoin falls hard the pot stocks have rallied hard, so inversely correlated, suggesting a certain level of rotation. And with around  30 day advance warning from bitcoin, as on these charts bitcoin is moved 30 days into the future. They are both attracting highly speculative money, and I'm sure many people that feel they missed out on bitcoin are chasing whatever seems to be the next big thing, aided by the hype for both on CNBC. They hyped bitcoin to the moon in 2017 and last year bitcoin was out and t it was pot stocks they pumped. Both crypto and pot stocks have a lot of amateur money in too, and both have that new/alternative aspect, which appeals to a similar audience. So from a purely short term trading perspective, it has been an interesting relationship to watch.

I don't really understand your point. I'm not saying rush out and buy or sell anything, quite the opposite, I think both these markets are riddled with amateur and jumpy money.  I also just said they were both hyped to the moon one after the other on CNBC, as well as many of the other channels and news sites. My post is food for thought, not a recommendation. I like to look at relationships between asset classes, the one between these two I think is very clear, but your post reads like you are determined to give a rebuttal. Are you in a bitcoin position?
