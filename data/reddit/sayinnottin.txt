And how will bitcoin progress if everyone has that attitude?
People need to keep spending to help it grow.

Are you sure that the tax free bracket is not affected by age? 
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:57:07
Nevermind, it seems that my account is restricted due to me being under 18.
I think I'll stick with coinbase as my wallet but buy from a different exchange. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:03:58
That's a shame, I will need to try and find an exchange which accepts under 18s now.

Yeah this is what I was thinking but I cannot find an explicit answer online.
I currently work a job at weekends and as far as I know I don't pay tax, however I'm wondering if this differs with bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:32:23
Are you sure? I've just got a figure of £11.5k however that is for everyone, providing that the other comment about it being regardless of age being correct.

When you added your card did it take a while to verify or anything?
The card appears in settings, when I go to buy no matter what amount of gbp or bitcoin I enter I cannot process further as the funding source is empty and there are no options for it, it doesnt even come up with SEPA there.
If I go into my EUR wallet and click deposit then it comes up with the option for SEPA payment, but I cannot do that as my bank doesn't offer it to personal accounts AFAIK.

Do they not accept card payment over mobile? 
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:31:43
No as I already did that. I added my visa and now when I click buy it says debit from and that field is blank.

I don't own much bitcoin as it is, I bought a tiny amount a year ago and that is it. I currently want to start buying, ideally by rounding off my wages every fortnight to a certain amount.
However I do want to be aware of any tax implications, I'm not trying to get rich quick and I doubt I'd make that much. However with me being a student I would like the piece of mind that at any time I would like to withdraw I would be able to without HMRC knocking on my door.

Hey mate, I'm under 18 myself and was just wondering which method you used to purchase?
Currently every exchange I have tried is age restricted, my only option seems to be localbitcoins.

Mobile at the moment, I'll try it on my desktop now. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:35:35
Alright fair enough I might just follow that to be on the safe side. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:26:50
And what is the earnings bracket for this? 
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:27:40
Currently I would estimate that I am using only about £5000 a year, am I correct in thinking that the tax free amount is £9000?
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:41:27
Great idea :)

My issue is that so far I have transfered £0, my card doesn't appear in the funding source when going to buy. I may have to use an external service but I wanted to avoid that.
