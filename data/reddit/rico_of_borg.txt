show me the figures for bitcoin then.  i've been vested in btc since early 2012 and have never used them on anything illegal.  i'm skeptical of your 25% figure that you're making up.

welcome to cnn/disqus forums.  i posted a  few times today arguing that they don't know what they are talking about and how it's a site not BTC themselves.  it doesn't matter.  anything pro BTC gets mocked and anything against BTC gathers the votes.  sad and idiotic.

because people who disagree and really have no argument will throw out the trump card (tinfoil-joe) to pander to like minded people.  no better way to discredit something by calling it a conspiracy.  no matter what comes after that people already have a prejudice about anything conspiracy related and will just shut it down because it's a "conspiracy" regardless of the facts presented.
personally, i don't see a conspiracy just because someone exchanged a briefcase but it does become a different matter when all of a sudden video is missing (which we don't know for sure).

i was being conservative. In 2003 it was actually $329 billion in the drug trade alone.  plenty of other crimes are being committed with fiat other than drugs.

good point.  but yes exactly except they seem to be rather misinformed about the pretty much everything.  read the comments and you'll be shaking your head.  i guarantee it.

tens of billions of dollars a year is used as drug money.  account for all other black market activities and i guarantee you there has been more crime committed by percentage in fiat than there has been in crypto.

i still think we are focusing too much on just drugs.  there's never going to be a real number on illegal activities but i just have a hard time believing that less than 25% of fiat is not used at one point or another for illegal activities.

weird...why are we still seeing the comment?  i thought reddit deleted posts from deleted users?

i've got my eye and lube on both of you!

i actually caught him the other day driving his moped for the first time.   a few days later i caught his wife in their mini cooper with all the question marks.  
i freaked out the first time because i had no clue he lived in the area but i grew up seeing him all over TV.

i thought the first pizza sold with bitcoin was the 50,000BTC purchase a few years ago?
edit: which is worth $41,000,000 right now.

yeah..definitely seems like this guy is outsourcing something nefarious.

no this was in Maryland.  he lives in Kensington, MD from what he told me. [ i made a post a few weeks ago with a pic of him.](
@_date: 2013-12-03 20:44:19
ah, ok.  thanks for the update.  how can i change my number though?

semi-noob here but before asic, fpga, and gpu people were using just their cpu's to mine.  people who were grassroots in on the bitcoin movement began mining with cpus. along the way people began to write up code to utilize their gpu's to mine because they could hash quickly.  people complained that gpu's were going to kill the movement but people adapated.  now fpga and asic miners are making gpu miners go through what the cpu miners did originally.

hmm interesting.  i thought they said they were waiting for me to approve the text.  someone approved something for me :\
@_date: 2013-07-02 02:35:53
that was extremely hard to read.  should post this on @_date: 2013-12-03 19:51:03
i would use kraken if they actually responded to my support requests.  typo'd my phone number on sign up and magically got verified even though i never received the text.  seemed fishy from the start.

pretty much.  i sold mine at $23 back before the 1st crash thought i lucked out.  bought some more cards around February of this year to mine when this was at $8 but then after a week of mining decided it wasn't worth it and returned the cards.   then i thought about actually purchasing at $30 thinking but decided not to because $30 was wayyyyyy to high.  boy am i retarded....
