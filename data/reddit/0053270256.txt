True only if I convert to fiat right? I put in $36k, have never withdrawn fiat till now. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 05:45:52
Yeah. That's one way or looking at it. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 18:35:44
Why did you not?

Story time:
I bought 36 bitcoins earlier this year for $36,000. I was HODLING them strong till May when I was tempted with ETH's growth and converted them to 303 ETH. Sure enough, Bitcoin mooned and ETH went sideways for months. I FOMO'ed and bought back into 20 Bitcoins. Altcoins started mooning. I decided on a strategy, diversify my investments and HODL for at least 6 months. I went 40% BTC, 30% ETH, 30% OMG. I further diluted ETH and OMG and added KNC and RDN. 
Advice: HODL, Don't trade
My only successful trade till date has been ETH&lt;-&gt;RDN where I made more than 200% gains.
I invested in OMG and KNC only because Vitalik was an advisor and I thought he would have done his research before committing his time. I was lazy. I plan to sell my OMG and KNC for projects that I genuinely believe in (hello RDN). 
Thanks Bitcoin and Altcoins.

Lol. What do I have to gain by lying? I'm not selling anything and this is a throw away account.

Would love to know if anyone has personal experience using this. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 04:19:34
I deleted that and posted again using a throw away account.

I'll only withdraw fiat as and when I need them.

I was in ETH when that fork happened. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 04:20:45
Yeah. It was around 70% at that time.

@_date: 2017-11-20 05:29:00
Yep. Lesson learned. I also sold 834 ETH at $10.
