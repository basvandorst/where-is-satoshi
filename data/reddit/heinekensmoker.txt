That's not the bottom and you know it.

$6500 is the new $8000...nothing to celebrate guys and gals.

I agree with you, but there is a big difference between possibilities and probabilities.

I think Tom Lee is past his 15minutes of fame.

Okay. Sorry about your losses. I think if you bury your head in the sand, then the reality of the situation will go away.

August 3 news. Markets have digested it already. And the price is in the $6000s. Any reason this could change?

Easier to buy today than ever before. And its value has been dropping faster than it's ever dropped before. What does that tell you?

It's Bitcoin's time to fail? You mean you think it can lose 34,000% of it's value? Bold prediction.

I think the moon is $8000. Probably all the moon that is going to happen in 2018.
(down vote the crap outta me but it isn't going to help bitcoin's price. Look instead of downvote me why not lay out a reason that bitcoin is going to be $10K+ before 2019. I am just looking at the charts and it doesn't seem that that case is likely at all. It looks like the hype of crypto currencies has peaked, I don't see it as a payment option in real life at all. I have not seen any evidence that it is becoming more popular. And if it doesn't become more popular as a payment method then why would it go higher?)

Valuation of any asset is calculated by price not percentage. Maybe you need to go back to school if you don't understand this simple concept. Sorry about your bitcoin losses but please don't be butthurt about it.

Nobody is going to look at the 1 year chart of bitcoin and think "hey this is how I will fund my  lambo." All the delusional bitcoin fanboys have spent all their money on bitcoin already and are holding. Who will be the new masses? There is a finite supply of dumb people left.

Bitcoin is only for buying Lambos

The World Wide Web was invented in my lifetime. You think that bitcoin is going to beat that? Yeah you are completely delusional.
@_date: 2018-08-11 05:54:10
So the 20% of your "stack" that you kept as it fell from $19k....hasn't lost a dime? Are you for real? Since you didn't sell 20% then yeah you have lost plenty of dimes.

Bitcoin advocates like bitcoin because it's unregulated. Because it's unregulated the SEC will not approve any ETF. Bitcoin advocates want an ETF. How does this even make sense?

Look at the YTD chart. Any questions where we are headed?  Use a big red crayon and ruler if you need any help.

what about the 100s of HODLer posts month after month during these devastating declines? You gonna balance that out?
@_date: 2018-08-11 05:30:35
Here is the problem with that type of argument. $200 is A LOT different than $6000. It isn't even a fair comparison. The same arguments with people talking about when it crashed to $1 and recovered. A crash from $19,000 is WAY different than a crash from $1000. Also now that it is $6000 there is no chance for someone to be a multi-millionaire by just buying $1000 worth of bitcoin like in the past. If it goes back up to $18,000 then sure you made a 200% gain but is that the same as the people who bought at $100 and it went to $18,000? Not even close. The get insanely rich from buying bitcoin story is completely over.
