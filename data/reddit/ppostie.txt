Any wallet that lets you customize your own fee.
Then use [this]( page to help you determine the lowest fee that will allow TX to be put into the next block.  
 
 I recommend the electrum wallet.

This is a very biased source... no idea where they are getting that number from. A next block transaction is usually under a dollar for me, sometimes a quarter.

This was great. Thanks!
